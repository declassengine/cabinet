HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT..NNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.jUth April,  19U7.CABINETNATIONALISATION OF GASMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of Fuel and power the object of this memorandum is to put before mycolleagues the salient points about the nationalisation of gas -particularly that the case for nationalisation  is a very strongone,  that delay in nationalisation will be highly prejudicialboth to the national economy and to the industry and that the gas Nationalisation Bill is unlikely to be unduly controversial.I.    THE CASE FOR THE NATIONALISATION OP GAS2. Gas is an old industry and its structure is Victorian.There ore over 1,000 undertakings]    about a third of the gas is supplied by municipalities and two-thirds by Companies.(See Annex, which also gives the comparable figures for electricity)-.      The present geographical layout is a patchwork,like that of electricity,  with an  intermingling of municipalundertakings,  independent companies and companies controlled by holding groups.3* Technically,  there are great variations in theefficiency and size of gas undertakings,  which range from theLondon Gas Light and Coke Company,  the largest in the world,to the numerous small .country gasworks.      Development of gasgrids will never be nation-wide,  as in electricity, but indensely populated areas there is a strong case for concentratinggas manufacture in large units and distributing it by means ofgrids.      This has happened in Yorkshire and in London,  but thereis no reason,  other than the antiquated structure of theindustry,  why there should not also be grids for such areas asCentral Scotland, Lancashire,  Midlands and South Wales.       (inthe latter case a grid is in fact being planned at theinstigation of my Ministry (see L.P.(D.I.)(do)  103),Geographical reorganisation of the gas industry is most difficult with the present structure, but it is highly desirable in the interests of the supply of cheap and abundant gas to industry as well as to domestic consumers.k- The unsatisfactory structure of the industry has long been recognised and in 191+2 Sir Andrew Duncan,  when President ofthe Board of Trade,  invited the Gas Industry to submitsuggestions for reorganisation.      It was the inadequacy of theseProposals which led to the setting up of the Committee under mr. Geoffrey Heyworth,  which reported in December.,  1,9h-5(Cmd.  6699:  note maps),
5.The Heyworth Report said that:-!,A basic change in the structure of the industry isthe only approach that can produce reallyeffective results quickly.      The direction ofthe required change is clearly marked,  namelytowards groupings into larger units.      This ispreponderantly the view of the industry itself..It is in no sense a revolutionary idea;    it is entirely consistent with past history, which shows a steadily accelerating trend towardsintegrations       (Paragraphs 229-30) ,The Committee recommended what was in effect  a scheme of nationalisation under ten Regional Boards,  to the ownership of which all existing undertakings were to he transferred.The industry is in fact dead ripe for nationalisation.11*    THE DANGERS OF DELAY6. The nationalisation of gas supply -was included inthe Legislative Programme for this Parliament.      With the nationalisation of coal and electricity,  it will complete litheconcerted plan for the co-ordination of the fuel and powerindustries&quot; referred to in the King&apos;s Speech for 191+5-6..7. The gas industry has,   as regards its organisation,been in a state of suspense since Sir Andrew Duncan&apos;approach in 191+2.      Since that date the normal process of integration in the gas industry,  by amalgamation and holding company acquisitions,  has been deliberately checked by myDepartment.8. The feeling of suspense in the industry was intensifiedwhen the Government&apos;s intention to nationalise was announcedsome 18 months ago.      They are working on the assumption,indicated informally to them by the Ministry,  that they willprobably be nationalised in&apos; the next Session.      The industryis opposed to  nationalisation in principle, but they have votedemphatically in favour of co-operating with the Ministry indrawing up a scheme for reorganisation.      Just before the fuelcrisis,  the British Gas Council put to the Ministry tentative-proposals for Regional Boards and a Central Board,  very similarto those which I suggest below and the Council is in fact working at the moment  on the details of regional boundaries.9. If I now had to tell the industry that nationalisationis postponed until 191+8-9, the following results are probable(a) This further delay, meaning an interval of at leastfour years between the announcement of nationalisationand the vesting date,  and a much longer intervalsince re-organisation was first mooted in 19b-2, willbe most  prejudicial to the efficient development ofthe industry.(b) a large section of the industry would assume thatthey were not going to be nationalised at all.      Thedelay would strengthen the hand of the non-co-operetorsand weaken that of the public-spirited,  who are becoming increasingly restive because of the delay.The co-operation of the industry in the planning ofits nationalised structure might be withdrawn,  perhapsfor good.
(c) The Industry must spend much money in putting rightarrears of maintenance.      Development in gas supplies is necessary for new factories,  e.g.,  in South Wales,and for the numerous housing estates now &quot;being erected.Further delay would mean that many undertakings wouldbe reluctant to proceed with capital development.There are already certain difficulties about  a financial assurance which had to be given last year tothe industry, namely,  that undertakings would neitherlose nor gain,  on nationalisation,  hy carrying outapproved capital development in the Interim period.Some undertakings are questioning the meaning of ourassurance and even the Treasury now has some doubts about it.      If the interim period is lengthened,  wemay well reach an impasse on this matter, with veryserious results on the capital development of theindustry.(d) Until the new Regional Boards are set up, it is difficultto ensure that all the development schemes are on theright lines.      There is s danger of parochial planningby each undertaking,  particularly because there are no official co-ordinating bodies for gas like the central electricity Board and the Electricity Commission.The detailed supervision of the capital development programmes in this interim period lies,  therefore,in effect with my Ministry,  in virtue of our controlover raw materials.      The Ministry will be relieved ofthis responsibility by the passage of the NationalisationBill and the sooner this is done the bettor.(e) Schemes like the gas grid being; planned for the westernpart of South Wales  (see L.P.(D.I. )(uB)  103)  can only at present be imposed on the existing mosaic of undertakings - without setting up a new Board withoverriding powers for the whole area - because theindustry is shortly to be nationalised.      Ifnationalisation is postponed we shall almost certainly have to go to Parliament next year with a Bill to setup an interim organisation in this area and perhaps in others.(f) The gas industry will suffer vis-a-vis electricity,   ifthe time between the nationalisation of the two industries is at all prolonged.      Although gas probably has animportant port to play in our national economy formany years,  it is,  of the two industries, obviouslythe one which is on the defensive.      This means that thetwo industries ought,  as soon as possible,  to haveorganisations which are comparably efficient.(g) Delay would prejudice our general policy of co-ordinating the fuel and power industries.      The planning of c fuel policy will take time,  but I do not think this can be started properly until the three main fuel industries have been nationalised and there is a responsibleorganisation for each of them.
*5 (i  fo U a)III.    T^^-JIi^M^10. The Gas Bill will have many similarities with theElectricity Bill.      Its main features  should be the following:-r egign a 1;J Boards11. There should be about ten Regional Boards as recommended by the Heyworth Committee.      In these should be vested the whole of the assets of the gas industry, both for manufacture and distribution.Central Board12. A Central Board will be necessary (although the HeyworthCommittee did not recommend one)  if only because the.industry must have a national body to negotiate with other nationalised industries.      In electricity,  generation and distribution  arebeing separated and the Central 3oord for electricity has a dualfunction,  namely,  the running of generation and the co-ordinationof the Regional Distribution Boards.      In the case of gas,the Central Board will be mainly a co-ordinating,  and perhaps afinancing, body.       In gas,   there is everything to be said for themaximum devolution to,  and even below,  the Regional Boards.Compensation13. The transport  and electricity precedents point toadopting a share market value basis for gas.      This probablyis the right basis,  though there is the difficulty of the verylarge number of small companies with unquoted, stocks in this industry.      The total cost of acquiring the industry has been estimated at about ,0200 million  (excluding the coke ovens,  etc.).Coke-ovens and by-products1d. There will be various complications in the nationalis-ation of gas,   because the industry makes other products than gasand because gas is made at coke oven plants as well as atgasworks:-(a) The coke ovens and the gasworks operate, basically,the same process - the carbonisation of coal toproduce gas,  coke and by-products,  such as coal-tarand benzole.(b) The coke ovens carbonise about the same amount of coalper annum as the gasworks (about 20 million tons).About    half the capacity is ct colliery coke ovenplants,  owned by the Notional Coal Board,  and about half is at steelworks.(c) As regards the products, much of the coke oven coke is&quot;metallurgical&quot; coke for blast furnaces,  but muchcompetes in the same domestic and commercial marketsas gas coke.      Increasingly large quantities of gasfrom both colliery and steelworks coke ovens is passed to gas undertakings for public supply and thecoke oven plants will become increasingly importantnuclei for gas grids in the coalfields.      the by-products of the gasworks and the coke ovens goto the same markets.
9  f?15. The preceding paragraph indicated that close co-ordination of the whole field of coal carbonisation is required.This must be an important element in fuel and power policy and itis another reason for the speedy nationalisation of gas.16. We shall have to consider whether some at least of theNational Coal Board coke oven plants should not go over to the gas Boards.      This will be a matter for discussion with theNational Coal Board and can,  if necessary, be dealt with in theBill by permissive powers.      The Gas Boards should also possiblyacquire some of the independent by-product plants.Work involved in the Bill17. Though there will be important deviations in places,the Bill can,  I think,  follow the Electricity Bill very closely in many of its detailed clauses.      This should considerably reducethe load on the parliamentary draftsmen.      There is a good deal of detailed work for my Ministry,   such as working out the amendmentot the complex statutory code for gas  (as in the Schedules to theElectricity Bill).      But this is already being done and it presentsno serious difficulties.      As the policy issues involved in theBill are fairly simple,  the burden on my senior officers shouldbe considerably less than  in the case of  the Coal and ElectricityBills.Date of introduction18. Prom what I have said,  I would strongly oppose the postponement of  the Gas Bill  to the 1 91+8/9 Session.       I think could hope to introduce the Bill a year after the ElectricityBill,  i.e.,   in January,  191+8.      But  I do not  think that it wouldbe reasonable to expect my Ministry to be ready with the bill before -January,  191+8.IV.    conclusion conclude therefore:-(1)    There is a strong case for the nationalisation of the gas industry.      There is much scope for improving theefficiency of  the industry,  but little can be doneuntil the existing antiquated structure is replaced.:,Ye have the Report of a recent and impartial Committee,the Heyworth Committee,  which in 191+5 recommendednationalisation of the industry under Regional Boards.The industry is,  in fact,  dead ripe for nationalisation.(2)    The industry has been in suspense as regards its organisation since well before the appointment of theHeyworth Committee.      Further delay will intensify thefeeling of frustration;, particularly in the considerable section of the industry which is atpresent co-operative.      This would prejudice, thecapital development of the industry, which is alreadytending to suffer owing to the financial uncertaintiesof the interim period.      A new organisation for theindustry must be set up as soon as possible,  to guide the capital development of the industry on the most up-to-date lines and to co-operate in the planning of fuel and power policy as a whole.
90M J(3)    The Gas Nationalisation Bill will not,  in my view,  be ivery difficult or controversial measure to get through Parliament.      Many of the general principles,and also of the detailed clauses, will have beenfought out in the case of electricity.      The HeyworthCommittee has pointed the way to what we shall be doing and the industry is reasonably co-operative.It will be difficult for critics to make anyreasoned case against the scheme.Ministry of Fuel and Power.7, Millbank,  8.W.1.11+th April,  191+7.
