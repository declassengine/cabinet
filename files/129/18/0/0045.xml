THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47)  1453rdMay,  1947.cabinet copy NO.ADJUSTMENT OP RAILWAY FaRES AND CHARGES,  AND claims for REDUCED HOURS AND INCREASED wages memorandum by the Minister of transport i have reported to the Lord President&apos;s Committee theposition of the Railway Control Account and they have agreedupon recommendations for increasing the charges of the RsilwayCompanies to meet the position.2. The severe weather and the fuel crisis led to a heavyfall in the&quot; receipts of the railway companies in the first quarter of 1947 and there was a deficiency of  175 millions.On the Railway Companies&apos;  estimates this will Increase to  , 22f millions by the 30th June.      The estimated deficiency forthe last half of this year is  9-^ millions,  and for the first halfof next year  15 millions;    the first&apos; half of next year contains a smaller proportion of the year&apos;s passenger traffic.      thus the estimated deficiency for a future year is  24? millions.3. The important estimates are those for receipts from&apos;coal, merchandise and ordinary passengers and. for expenditure.For the future year,  the Railway Companies estimate an increaseof about  3 millions in coal receipts as compared with last year,reflecting the increased coal target.      For merchandise theyestimate a drop of  41 millions,  due to a fall, in Governmenttraffic partially offset by a 3% increase in  public traffic.The big fall as compared with last year is that of  21 millions for ordinary passengers, due to the fall in Government traffic and the 10% cut in passenger train services.      The estimate for expenditure is about  9 millions higher than last year&quot;,   &amp;- - .millions being in respect of increased costs and  7 millions in respect of increased maintenance,  less  4 millions for savingsdue to fall in traffic.4. The increases recommended in railway charges are:-Present Proposedover pre-war fo over pre-warSeasons &amp; Workmen&apos;s 25 30Ordinary passengers and Parcels 33-1/3 45Coal 25 33-1/3Merchandise 25 33-1/3
Corresponding increases would be made in other charges.These include an increase from 50% to &amp;0% over pre-war inthe charges for foreign-going vessels and goods at therailway-owned docks-      It has been agreed already that increased&apos;charges on coastwise shipping should not exceed 15fa.5? The increased charges should be brought into operation on 1st July,  19lf71      It is estimated that they would yield 11.9 millions in the six months ending 31st December,  191+7,   and 11.1 millions in the six months ending 30th June,  19U8.      Theresult would be that the Exchequer &quot;would bear approximately  20-iraillions of this year&apos;s deficiency,  i.e.  the deficiency of  221millions for tin. first half,   less  2,h: millions by which, the yieldin the second half would exceed the current deficiency. &quot;    In thefirst half of next year,  the deficiency might exceed the yield by nearly  h millions,  but it would be a reasonable risk to assume that there may be some small improvement in traffic beyond theestimates.      Over the 12 months equilibrium would be nearly achieved.6. It is expected that the Control Account of the london passenger Transport Board,  whose charges were increased on 9th February,  19h7, will balance,  and no further adjustment in their charges is proposed.7. In the above estimates and recommendations no account has been taken of any additional costs due to reduced working hours or increased wages.Applications have been made by the three Railway unions and the Railway Shopmen&apos;s National Council to the RailwayCompanies and the Board for increased wages and improvementsof conditions for the conciliation,  salaried and workshop staffs.Briefly, the workshop staff are asking for a reductionin standard weekly hours from Iff to 40,  the National Union of railwaymen for a reduction from a.8 to 1+0,  the Associated society of Engineers and Firemen for a reduction from U8 to l+u, and. theN.U.R.  and the Railway Clerks Association,  in respect ofsalaried staff,  lor 3 x*g duction from a week: at present varying from 38 to 48 hours to a  standard of 35 hours.     &apos;The pay claims in respect of the conciliation, salaried and workshop staffsare for an increase of  1   a week;    A.S.L.E.F.  ask for increasesranging up to 29/6 a. -week for drivers,  firemen and cleaners.In addition,  claims are made for enhanced rates of overtime payat week-ends for conciliation and salaried staffs,  and on behalfof the workshop staff,  for the consolidation of war additionsinto their standard rates of pay, with consequential incr asesin piecework prices.8. The claims for a LO-hour and a 35-hour week respecti/olymay probably be regarded as ultimate objectives not immediatelyattainable in view of the manpower situation,  and the Unionswill probably concentrate upon a reduction to a fur-hour week,which was introduced into the engineering industry generally on1st January,  19h,7-9* Increased rates&apos; of pay were granted to conciliation and -salaried staffs in August,  19h7,  and it was made clear- duringthe negotiations that these increases were intended as a post-war settlement.      It was indeed the first of a seriescovering post-war conditions in other industries.      The rates-of pay have,   however,  since been consolidated.
10.    - At the same time advances were made in the rates of pay for workshop staffs, hut their war-time additions have not so far keen consolidated.      The Shopmen&apos;s National Council areasking for the whole of the war advances and other additions to ho consolidated and for piece-work prices to he adjustedso that the normal worker will earn a minimum addition of25/o on the new consolidated rates instead of the presentminimum of 33-j/S on existing hase rates.11. It  is estimated that approximately 47,000 additionalmen would he required to offset the effects of reduction of hours of railway workers generally to 44.      Alternatively,the reduced hours would involve additional overtime, whichis estimated to cost about  15 millions.      If the increases in pay for all grades were conceded as well as the reducedhours,  the total cost is placed at about  88 millions a year.12. An additional cost of  15 millions would representa difference between the recommended increases in charges of30%, 45% and 33i% and increases of 35%, 50% and 40%, whilean additional cost of  88 millions would represent  thedifference between the recommended increases and increases ofat least 65%, 80a and 70%.      In both cases the increases wouldbe higher still if allowance were made for a consequential-fall In traffic. &apos; -13. The negotiation of these claims devolves in theordirrary course on the m; nagements of the Railway companies and the Board, but the cost of any concession, would,  duringthe remaining period of control, be a charge on the Exchequerexcept in so far as it was met by increases in charges.After 1st January next,  it would be a charge on the british transport Commission, whose reserve must be sufficient tomeet all charges properly chargeable to revenue.      In thesecircumstances the managements have brought the position tomy notice and seek guidance as to the line that they.shouldtake in the negotiations.The Lord President&apos;s Committee have agreed with measures to the extent to which railway charges should be increased,apart from these new claims from the staff and also with my proposal first to meet the-Railways and the Trade Unionstogether and explain to them the r)osition of the ControlAccount and the increases in charges which it will benecessary to introduce.      I should then indicate that theresponsibility for reaching as soon as possible a conclusion in the light of the situation made known to them rests withthe Companies and the Unions,  and suggest that failingability to agree,  the claims should be referred to theNational Arbitration Tribunal,   in accordance with theconstituted machinery of conciliation in the  industry,  or,if that - is not acceptable, to a Court of Enquiry.14. An early decision and speedy action upon it arenecessary.      On the one hand the Unions are pressing for a reply to their claims without delay,  and there are alreadysigns of impatience among the men.      On the other hand,  theLord President&apos;s Committee felt that the increase in charges should not be announced until decisions have been reached in regard to the Undons &apos;  c 1 aIrns .
SillCotic Iusione15. I recommend that -(a) On the &quot;basis of the position of the Railway ControlAccount;,  as now known and estimated,  authority be given forthe increases referred to &apos; in paragraph 4,  to be operativefrom 1st July,  1947;(b) I should be authorised to meet the general managers of the Railway Companies and the Trade Unions and to explain the position to them and urge a speedy conclusion to theirnogot iat ions;(c) Failing agreement,  the claims should be referredto the National Arbitration Tribunal (or to a Court ofEnquiry:);   .(cl) In the event of a settlement on the staff claimsnecessitating a further increase in charges, I should reportagain to the Cabinet;    but it must be realised that  if the increases of charges are to be brought into operation on1 s t July 11 rn u a t b e a nno u nc e d n o t I a t e r t h an 191 h M ay toenable the Railway Companies to make the necessaryalterations j n the rate books and fare tables.      Anydeferment of the increases will impose serious additionalcharges on the -Exchequer. &apos;A.B.Ministry of Transport,3rd May,  1947.
