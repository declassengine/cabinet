We are all agreedthat shortcomings exist and must be put right;    but, whereas we   .think that the remedy lies in a snore effective control and planning both by the Control authorities and German agencies,of the economic life of the combined zone, General Clay does not accept the necessity of central planning and is unwilling to restrict the rights of the individual Lander in favour of the(German)  bi-zonal organs we have created.2. I  had some discussion of this vital question withMr. Marshall in Moscow and agreed with him that General Robertsonand General Clay should endeavour to reach&apos; agreement.      So fax1the results have been disappointing owing to the intransigenceof General Clay.      Subject to the endorsement of my colleaguesI have therefore authorised General Robertson to bring the issue to a. head by presenting to General Clay the proposal reproduced in Appendix A.      My colleagues will observe that this contemplatesthe establishment of a Bizonal Economic Council with advisoryfunctions and certain powers of direction,  and that the wholeproposal is consistent with the principles which they approved,and which were generally agreed at Moscow (subject to agreement on other1 outstanding issues)  for the eventual constitution of a central German administration.3* General Clay has intimated that he would be more readyto agree to effective central control in the combined zone if itwere exercised under the direction of a bi-zonal parliament.Complete political fusion on this scale would in ray view prejudice the chances of agreement with Russia when the Council of foreign ministers resumes discussion of the German question in November.I therefore ask my colleagues -(a) To approve the proposal at Appendix A as a basis of&quot;n e go t i a t i o n ;(b) To agree that the constitution of a bi-zonal parliament would be premature;(c) To agree that if no satisfactory agreement can bereached with General Clay in Berlin,   the question should be taken up with Mr.  Marshall in Washington.
h. - I would emphasise that nothing in the proposals in Appendix A affects the agreed policy of socialisationin the British Zone.      In this connection I would invitethe attention of ray colleagues to the concluding sentence of Berlin telegram Ho.  681   (Appendix B).E.B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.,30th April,  191+7.

COPY OP TELEGRAM RO.   681 OF 29TH APRIL,   1947,FROM BERLIN TO FOREIGN OFFICEMOST IMMEDIATECONFIDENTIALFollowing from Robertson.I saw General Clay this morning.      I was accompanieby Strang and Weir.      Murphy and Draper were also present.Clay said that sooner than give his opinion on the reporton our previous negotiations which I had shown him he would prefer not  to comment  on it, but; would be ready to have abipartite board meeting with me at which we should agree upon a joint report to our respective Governments reflectingour differences.      I accepted this proposal and asiffhimto prepare a first draft.      I then discussed the possibilitieof some form of political fusion leading round to the note of which a copy was given to the Secretary of State before his departure.      Clay repeated his view that anything lessthan a fully constitutor! Bizonal Parliament would give ussomething less than we needed to resolve our difficulties and problems while not abating the flood of criticism fromthe Soviet.      He thought that if any German body were given any&apos; responsibilities regarding the reparations plan it would immediately incur great unpopularity among the Germans.However,  he was in a receptive mood and undertook to considerthe note and to obtain the opinion of his government upon it.I stressed that the note itself did not necessarily reflectHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy but could only be regardedas a proposal ad referendum.      I will report further when.Clay gives me his reactions.      The question of socialisation of industry came up incidentally.      Murphy asked whether wehad decided to do  it on a land basis or on a broader basis.He indicated plainly that a solution on a land basis wouldbe preferable from the United States point of view.
