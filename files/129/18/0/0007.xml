The conditionsof military administration need not be more severe than under civil administration.Martial law may be imposed, under circumstancesof rebellion,  insurrection or riot amounting to a state of .war.      Unless martial law is imposed throughout the country,the way is open to challenge its justification by referenceto the Civil Courts which will remain in operation in those parts of the country not under martial law.3* Statutory martial law is the name given to the exceptional powers which can be assumed by the Crown inPalestine under authority of Article 6,. Palestine (Defence)Order-in-0ounci1,  1937-      These powers cannot, we understand,be successfully challenged in the courts.Under Supplement No.  2 to the Palestine GazetteExtraordinary No.   1558 of 2nd March,  19h7,  the powers thenassumed took; the form -of restrictions applied within certain areas of Palestine and enforced by the military arm.      these restrictions were as follows:-(a) Suspension of all government and public services.(b) Closure of Post and. Telegraph Offices,  andsuspension of telephone services.(c) Withdrawal of customs,   port and railway facilities.(d) Stoppage of movement of persons or supplies in orout of the areas,  except for foodstuffs and special cases under1 permit.It does not necessarily follow that on another occasion therestrictions would be confined to these,  or for that matter,that all these particular restrictions would be imposed.
4$ /oAIMk- The aim of this paper is to report on the measures necessary for maintaining law and order in Palestine duringthe next six months,  with special reference to the possibilityof imposing martial law over the whole of the country.FACTORS-Present attitude of the two communities in Palestine5- Jews.      In present conditions the great majorityof the Jewish community denounce terrorist outrages butare not so far prepared to lay specific information againstindividuals.      The Hagana and Palmach are quiescent and areeven  showing small signs Of taking on their own,  steps againstthe terrorists which may increase and become more effective.Their potential for committing outrages is considerable andwhether they swing for or against lawful government is animportant factor.All Jews are rabid on the subject of immigration and say that if the quota was increased they would be moreinclined to co-operate with us.      An increase in the quota,however,  would be taken as a sign of weakness by Jews and arabs and also by the personnel of the administration and armed forces.      There is, moreover, no guarantee that anincrease in the quota would result in greater co-operation.The Irgun and Stern are still violently anti-Britishand will always be so.      They wish to force us to employsterner measures which can be represented as  punitive againstthe community,  thereby swinging moderate opinion against us and obtaining more recruits for themselves.      If the Boy Grunerappeal fails,   and if his execution and that of the fourothers sentenced to death is ordered,  an  excuse will be madefor a new outbreak of extremist action.      We assume thatsuch considerations would not be allowed to influence the appeal,  since the effect throughout Palestine of anyappearance of weakness as a result of threats or violenceWould be deplorable.      It must be emphasised that thistrouble-making element numbers no more than 6 - 7000 or about 1;e of the total Jewish population of the country.6. Arabs.      At present the Arabs are causing no troublebut they are quick to resent any consequences to themselves of measures taken against the Jews.Conditions governing successful anti-terrorist action7. The object of military operations in Palestine is toassist the civil government in maintaining law and order.This is achieved by exerting continuous pressure throughoutthe country including:-(a) Anticipatory action, against terrorist outrages.(b) Helping the police to apprehend terrorists bycordoning-off and searching areas.(c) Searching for caches of arms and ammunition.
An essential feature in suppression of terrorism is theco-operation of the civil population &quot;both in layinginformation against terrorists and in refusing them refuge.The headquarters of terrorist organisations are mostly in Jewish centres of  population,  particularly Tel Aviv.If these centres are cordoned off the terrorists are cut off from their bases and kept on the run,  which not only makes it easier for them to -be caught but limits their ability to commit outrages.80 Favourable conditions    for combating terrorism can,therefore, be created byi-(a) Isolating nerve centres of terrorist activity.(b) Interrupting communications which are essentialto the planning and committing of outrages.COURSES9- To assist in combating terrorism and to maintainlaw and order in Palestine during the next six months,the following courses are open to us:-(a) To impose martial law over the whole or partof the country.(b) To impose and maintain statutory martial lawin certain areas for a long time&apos;.(c) To continue the civil governments  taking every advantage of the immense powers of theHigh Commissioner under Defence emergency regulations,  including the imposition of statutory martial law when and where required.Course (a) - martial law10* If martial law over the whole country were to be imposed in a sufficiently restrictive form to contribute towards anti-terrorist operations,  it would be a severe andunjust burden on Jew and Arab alike,   and it would be damaging to the country.      If this resulted in the Hag an aand the Arabs taking armed action against us this would seriously increase our military commitments.If severe restrictions -were not included-,  martial law would not contribute towards anti-terrorist operations and the military authorities would just the same be requiredto accept the additional burden of administering the country which the civil authorities were better qualified and organised to bear.      The assumption of such a burden would require agreat increase in military staffs since it would invest theWar Office and the G-.0.0. with the entire administration ofthe country.These conditions are entirely different from those under which we previously advised the Cabinet that our .existing forces in Palestine would be sufficient to fighteither the. Jews. or the Arabs but NOT against bothsimultaneously.,
3 i11. The imposition of martial law over1 a  port of thecountry might equally result in on un,justifiable and undesirable punishment of the Arabs.      It would, moreover,create a most complex problem of a divided administration ofthe country between the civil and military authorities.Finally,  as is pointed out in paragraph 2 above,  itsjustification could be questioned in the civil courts inother ports of the country.Course (b) - Statutory martial_low12. Past experience of statutory martial law.      In March19*17*  on &quot;area containing about 300,000 Jews,&quot; i. e.  half theJewish population    of Palestine was sealed off for a limited period by restrictions as shown in  paragraph 3 above.The effect on the Jewish community was considerable.      Therestrictions involved them in great financial loss and unemployment rapidly become acute.      Not only employers,therefore,  but organised Jewish labour realised, the needfor avoiding the imposition of restrictions by stopping the terrorist outrages.      Against this,  however, the.administrationsuffered loss of revenue and a large number of troops weretied down on static duties.The restrictions were,  in the view of the localauthorities,  lifted at the psychological moment,  and it isprobable that their imposition did not,  therefore,, causeany drift from the Hagona to the dissidents Yi/hich might well have occurred if they had been kept on for much longer.There is evidence that the Jewish community withinthe area that was restricted ore very apprehensive of there-irnposition of statutory martial law. There ore signsof greater co-operation from them and a limited amount ofinformation continues to be given to the police. Seventy-eightextremists were apprehended during its duration and since then others h..ve been apprehended as a result of its operation.1 3- Imposing and, maintaining statutory martial-law fora long time.      Favourable conditions for operations againstterrorists might well be created in those areas in whichstatutory martial law was instituted.      On the other hand,to maintain it for any considerable length of time would,owing to the severity of its effects on the civil population,result in:-(s)    Turning the Jewish community against us and thereby decreasing the co-operation which they give us.(b)    Crippling the economic life of a large sectionof the community and the country as a whole.. (c)    iis the result of (b)  a tendency to drive thoseJews who become unemployed into the ranks of the dissidents.(a)    Alienation of the Arabs in the districts affected.Course  (c)_- Continuance of present civil governmentThe High Commissioner already possesses under theDefence Regulations immense and ample powers to place at theI disposal of the G.O.C.      Included in these powers ore:--h-
(a) The ability to impose statutory martial lawwhen and where required.(b) Ability to establish suiiimary military courts.15. With regard to (a) above,  statutory martial law is an extremely powerful and flexible weapon,  and thenecessity for  its imposition,  unlike martial law,  cannot-be challenged successfully in the courts.      The threat ofits imposition is a strong incentive to the civilpopulation to assist the security forces.      The durationfor which it can be maintained must be carefully regulatedto ensure that the economy of the country is not crippledand that the public dp not lose the will to co-operate.16. With regard to (b) above - the establishment of summary military courts - there is no doubt that delays inexecuting sentences have caused a grave decrease ofconfidence in our firmness of purpose and have providedencouragement to the terrorists.      During the period of statutory martial law summary courts were set up in the restricted areas.      These courts were empowered to dealsummarily with certain, specified offences and awardedpunishments up to six months imprisonment or  100 fine.The High Commissioner has authority under the defence regulations to establish similar courts throughoutPalestine, whether or not statutory martial law  isenforced.      The existence of such courts would    in ourview, be a substantial contribution to the maintenanceof law and order, particularly if their powers could beextended to the death sentence for specified offencesand if provision were made to prevent the possibilityof legal delays in the execution of the sentence.CONCLUSION17. We conclude that the best course to followis the last - i. e.   the continuance of the present civil government.      This course is the most flexible,  its operation can be regulated to cause the minimum sufferingto the Arabs,   it avoids the administrative dislocationand disorganisation which must result from martial lawanr] it can be effective against terrorists,   if thepresent powers of the High Commissioner are exercisedto the full.RECOMMENDATIONS18. We therefore recommend that the measures takento maintain law and order in Palestine during the next six months should include:-(a) The continuance of civil government,  includingthe wide exercise of the powers already heldby the High Commissioner.(b) The intensification of the present continuousmilitary pressure against terrorists through-out the country.
(c) The re-impcsition for limited periods,when and where necessary, of statutorymartial law in appropriate areas.(d) The introduction of special summarymilitary courts to deal with specifiedoffences.      These courts should havethe power of awarding the death penaltyand provision should he made .to preventlegal delay in the execution of the sentence.TEDDERJ. II. D.   CUNNINGHAME. E.SIMPSON(V. C. I.G.
