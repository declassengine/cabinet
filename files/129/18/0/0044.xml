(47)  14-42ND : MAY,.;&apos; 194rCABINETCEYLON constitution memorandum by the Chairman of the colonial affairs committee at their meeting on 1st May (C.(47) 2nd Meeting)the Colonial Affairs Committee had under consideration amemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Annex)regarding the constitutional position in Ceylon.2. My colleagues will recollect that in October,1945, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided that Ceylon shouldbe granted immediately a constitution giving the ceylon government full control of her internal affairs,  in the expectation that she would eventually achieve Dominion statusby a process of evolution.      Having regard to recent develop-ments in India and Burma and to their repercussions on thepolitical situation in Ceylon, Mr.  D.S.   Senanayake,   the ViceChairman of Ceylon&apos;s Board of Ministers, now urges thatCeylon should at once he promised full independence withinthe British Commonwealth as soon as may be after the new parliament comes into being in October,  1947.      He undertakes that Ceylon for her part will be willing to enter into agreements with His Majesty&apos;s Government for safeguards inrespect of Imperial defence and external affairs.3. The Committee agree with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies that, for the reasons given by him a strongprima facie case has been made out for meeting this request.Subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, which are&quot;being obtained,  and to any comments which may be received from theDominion Governments, who are being informed, of the position,the Committee recommend that the Cabinet should authorise theSecretary of State for the Colonies to enter into discussionwith the Governor    of Ceylon and with Sir Oliver Goonetilleke(Mr.  Senanayake&apos;s representative, now in this country), witha view to formulating for the consideration of the Cabinetthe draft of a suitable announcement on the lines envisaged in the annex to this memorandum.A.G.G-wydyr House, S.W.I.2nd May,   1947.
r c.(U7) k29TH APRIL,  1947J7-     : cabinet cabinet COLONIAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEECEYLON constitution memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagties on this Committee will remember our bis-cussions leading up to the Order in Council of -15th May,  1946,which provided a new Constitution for Ceylon on the basis ofthe statement of policy on constitutional reform in Ceylonmade by His Majesty&apos;s Government in October,  1945 (Cmd. 6690).2.      Preparations for the introduction of the new Constitutionare well advanced, and It is expected that the new parliament will meet for the first time in October next.      In the mean-time, as I have informed the Prime Minister on the 22nd March,I have received a personal letter from Mr. Senanayake in whichhe explains that, as Leader of the Moderate Party which isfighting the forthcoming election for the new Parliament, heis seriously embarrassed by the considerable capital which his political opponents are making out of the acceptance by himself and other Ceylon Ministers of a constitutional statusfor Ceylon greatly inferior to that now accorded to India and burma.      He points out that a considerable number of hiscolleagues in the State Council desire immediate agitation for similar concessions to those made to India and Burma, andthat,  if serious deterioration in the political situation isto he prevented, action must be taken quickly.      I should explain that the political opposition to his Moderate partyconsists mainly of the Indian Congress party and of the communists, who have gained considerable ascendency in thelocal Trade Unions.3.      It will be remembered that proposals which were made byMr. Senanayake in the course of discussions with mypredecessoi? in 1945* for the grant of Dominion status to ceylon, were then rejected in principle by the Cabinet(see CM. (45)  30th Conclusions).      Mr.  Senanayake has,however, now sent Sir Oliver Goonet illeke, K.B.E., CM. G. ,the Financial Secretary of Ceylon, to this country to approachHis Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to securing areconsideration of the position.4.      SIR OLIVER GOOHETILLSKE has explained to me that thedominating factor in the recent developments was thedeclaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention to
withdraw from India in June-,  19U8.      Mr.  Senanayake regarded it as certain that when India became independent she would bring strong pressure on Ceylon to throw in her lot with india.      India would be In a position to put economic sanctions on Ceylon and,  through the local Congress party,could foment labour disturbances and gravely embarrass the ceylon Government.      He felt that it was unrealistic to suppose that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to face a major clash with India in order to protect Ceylon&apos;interests, and it was, therefore, essential that Ceylonshould secure her own International status as an independent state to enable her to have recourse to the protection ofthe United Nations against possible Indian aggression.      Atthe same time, Sir Oliver was able to assure lie that it isthe strong desire of the vast majority of the Ceylonese to achieve their independence within the British Commonwealth,and that Mr.  Senanayake is confident that if the promise of independence is given there will be no effective pressure forleaving the Commonwealth.5.      Mr.  Senanayake, therefore, has asked that Ceylonshould be granted full independence within the BritishCommonwealth as soon as possible after the new Parliamentcomes into being.      He is prepared, however,  to undertakethat Ceylon for her part will be willing,  if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment so desires, to negotiate agreements with HisMajesty&apos;s Government for safeguards in respect of Imperialdefence and external affairs, which are at present reservedsubjects&apos;  (see Annexure I).      These agreements, he suggests,should,  in the meanwhile, be drafted by me in consultationwith the Governor, who would in his turn consult his ministers under the existing Constitution as to what would be likely tobe acceptable to the future Government of Ceylon.6.      In putting forward these proposals on Mr.  Senanayake&apos;behalf,  Sir Oliver Goonetilleke asked that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should make an immediate declaration to theeffect that,  in the light of developments regarding Indiaand Burma, and in view of representations made to them byMr. Senanayake,  they have reconsidered the White Paper of19J+5 and have decided that,  instead of Ceylon being required(as envisaged in that Paper) to achieve Dominion status by a process of evolution (see Annexure It),  the people of Ceylonshould be given full independence as soon as possible after thenew parliament comes into being;    that, having regard to thedesire of the people of Ceylon to remain within the BritishCommonwealth,  the independence granted would be that of anindependent member of that Commonwealth&quot;.    and that instructions have been given for the preparation of the necessary documents to make possible the achievement of this objective.7.      Sir Oliver Goonetilleke pressed for.the use of theexpression &apos;-&apos; independence&quot; rather than &quot;Dominion status&quot;,since the latter&quot;was not used in the cases of India and Burma,but it is clear that in effect it is Dominion status which isbeing sought.      The status of a self-governing Colony such asSouthern Rhodesia would not be acceptable to Ceylon.     He alsocontemplated that- the necessary amendment of the newConstitution should be effected as soon as the agreements hadbeen negotiated with the new Government of Ceylon,  though hewas anxious that the declaration should not be so framed asto make the grant of the principle of independence conditional
on the conclusion of these agreements.      He emphasisedair. Senanayake&apos;s anxiety that Ceylon should be admitted to membership of the United Nations before June, 1948.      Inconclusion he said that Mr. Senanayake was anxious that the title of the Governor should be changed to HGovernor-general :and that responsibility in this country for the affairs of ceylon should be transferred to the Dominions Office.8.      Sir Oliver Goonetilleke thought it was most important that this declaration should be made before the opening ofthe final meeting of the present State Council on the13th May,  otherwise there was a definite risk that somemember of the Council would bring forward a Motion in favourof independence which could hardly fail to be passed.Mr. Senanayake, as he said, was naturally anxious to keep theinitiative in his own hands and to avoid allowing the questionof remaining in the British Commonwealth to become a matterof debaste.9.      I have no doubt whatever that the Ceylonese desire for independence is strong and genuine.      I have receivedconiiaunications from the Governor of Ceylon in which he urgesthat the most serious and prompt consideration should be givento ivir. Senanayake&apos; s proposals. &apos;   Sir Henry Moore furtherexpresses the view that the defence interests of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might well be better secured try a negotiated settlement of the nature now proposed than under the procedurelaid down in the Order in Council of May, 1946, which madedefence a reserved subject,  (see Amnexure I).10.    fhe position as I see it may be summarised thus:-Mr. Senanayake is faced with a general public demand thatCeylon should become &quot;independent&quot;.      He is distrustful ofand afraid of India and would prefer Ceylon to be anindependent member of the British Commonwealth rather thanbe absorbed by India.      He has to meet the growing criticism that Ceylon&apos;s rate of constitutional advance, despite herloyalty and assistance to His Majesty&apos;s Government during thewar, is slower than, that of India and Burma.      He is well aw areof the strategic importance of Ceylon to the BritishCommonwealth,  and is ready,  in return for the grant of independence within the Commonwealth, to meet His Majesty1sGovernments essential needs in the defence sphere, as wellas to give undertakings not to enter into foreign commitments which might be embarrassing to the Commonwealth as a whole.11.    I am advised that an amendment of the Statute of /westminster would not necessarily be required to secure thefurther advance which Mr. Senanayake is seeking, but that auAct of parliament would be needed to apply to Ceylon theprinciples of independence inherent in that Statute.12.    I have given anxious thought to this matter, moreparticularly&quot;in view of the accusation which has been made against the present Government of &quot;scuttle&quot; and of &quot;squanderingthe Empire&quot;.      It seems to me that, on the contrary, if thismatter is rightly handled,  we have an excellent opportunitynot only of keeping Ceylon within the British commonwealth and of securing our vital defence interests there, but ofdemonstrating to the world that our proclaimed policy forthe Colonial peoples is not an empty uoast, and that an^independent status in the Commonwealth is not, in practice,
33?w C? j^jreserved for people of European descent.      Such a demonstrationwould both confound our critics and give deserved encouragement to loyal and progressive elements in the Colonial peoples.Unless, on the other hand, a positive move is made now to forestall the demand for independence  which has been quickenedby events in India and Burma, there is, I understand, little prospect of the 1946 Constitution being successfullyinaugurated, and -the most unfortunate results may well follow.My conclusion is that we should accept in substance theproposals which Mr. benanayake, through Sir Oliver Goonetilleke,has put forward.15.    I recognise that the outcome largely depends uponMr. Senanayake himself, and that however much we may rely upon his good faith, and however likely it may he that he willreturn to power, we cannot be certain that  it will be withhim and not with some other leader that we shall have to dealwhen it comes to the point.      I fear that any attempt to qualify the grant of independence, or to make it in termsconditional on the prior acceptance by the Ceylon Governmentof  stipulations insisted upon by His Majesty&apos;s -Government,would seriously damage Mr. Senanayake!s chances of being-returned on a platform of &apos;&apos; independence within the Commonwealth&quot; .ffor should we, in practice, find it easy to enforce anystipulations upon a Ceylon Government committed to a policyof independence and indifferent or even hostile to themaintenance of the British connexion.      The dilemma is realbut I think it unlikely that our faith would prove unfounded.14.    I should, therefore, propose, if my colleagues agree, toenter into discussions at once with Sir Oliver Goonetillekeand to consult the Chiefs of Staff and other Departmentsconcerned, with a view to formulating an announcementsub slant tally on the lines contemplated in paragraphs 6 and above, in terms mutually acceptable to Mr. Senanayake on theone hand and to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the other.      Ishould not, of course, at this stage involve His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in any final commitment, but as soon as the agreedformula had been reached I would place it before this Committee,with a view to seeking Cabinet approval before making such anannouncement.      For the reasons given in paragraph 8 above, thematter is of some urgency.Colonial Office,D o wn i n g Street, S.W.1.29TH APRIL&apos;,  1947.

9 9 \&apos; . gj el c3ANNEXURE IIEXTRACT PROM STATEMENT OP POLICY ON constitutional reform IN CEYLON(Cmd.  6690) : &apos;     .     &apos;35&apos; S 35 X 3  XDECISIONS10.    His Majesty&apos;s Government are in sympathy with the desire c:the people of Ceylon, to advance towards Dominion status and the;are anxious to co-operate with them to that end.     With this inmind. His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusion thata Constitution on the general lines proposed by the SoulburyCommission (which also, conforms in broad outline, save as regsoathe Second Chamber, with the Constitutional scheke put fofwaxb,by the Ceylon ministers themselves) will provide a workablebasis for constitutional progress in Ceylon.Experience of the working of Parliamentary institutions inthe British Commonwealth has shown that  advance to dominion status has been effected by modification of existingconstitutions and. by the establishment of conventions which h..vcgrownup in actual practice.Legislation such as the Statute of Westminster has beenthe recognition of constitutional advances already achievedrather than the instrument by which they were secured.      It istherefore the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the newconstitution will be accepted by the people of Ceylon with a determination so to work it that in a comparatively short spaceof time such. Dominion status will be evolved.      The actuallength of time occupied by this evolutionary process must^depend upon the experience gained under the new constitutionby the people of Ceylon.ry
