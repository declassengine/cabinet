....._^ -../D(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET....... -COPY NO. d- ICP. (47)  1202nd A pril,  1 9dY-cabinet united NATIONS organisation memorandum by Minister of&apos; Labour and National service venture to offer to my colleagues the following observations on the Report of the Interdepartmental working party and the covering memorandum by the Minister of State(CP. (14-7) 114).Report A.      Secretariats of the United Nations andthe Specialised Agencies.2. I entirely agree with the Minister of State inendorsing the conclusions of the Working party on thisquestion.      I understand that some opposition to the proposalfor a Deputy Secretary General may be expected, from theRussians because they would not wish M.  Sobolev&apos;s status asAssistant Secretary General to be lowered.      It might be worth while considering whether,  in order to obtain Russianconcurrence,   two Deputy Secretaries General might be proposed - one in charge of Political and Security Affairs,(who presumably would be M.  Sobolev),  the other in charge ofEconomic and Social Affairs and of Administration.Report B.      The Location of Intergovernmental0 rganisations.3. The Working Party has set out fully the arguments forand against the various plans they have considered.Nevertheless I entirely agree with the Minister of State thatthey have over stressed the disadvantages of New York and. havenot sufficiently stressed its advantages.      I believe that theimportance of having the Specialised Agencies in questionlocated at the headquarters of the United Nations and withina short distance of the headquarters of the Bank and the Fund(with the additional advantage of being reasonably close toProvisional International Civil Aviation Organisation) is an absolutely decisive consideration.        My conclusions on thisReport are therefore:-(1 )    that the Specialised Agencies in question(international Labour Organisation, Food and agriculture Organisation,  International trade organisation,  International Shipping Organisationand World Health Organisation)  should if possibleall be located in the same place as the headquarters of the Economic  and Social Council;
11^I E that the wqrk and objectives of the InternationalLabour Organisation are so linked up with those ofthe Economic and Social Council that it is absolutely vital to the future of the InternationalLabour Organisation and its work that the headquarters of the International LabourOrganisation should be located with the headquarters of the Economic and Social Council.      Accordinglywhatever decision may be taken in regard to theother Specialised Agencies in question,  I desirethe authority of my colleagues to  press that the headquarters of the International LabourOrganisation shall be in the same place as theEconomic and Social Counciljthat as a first choice there are conclusivearguments why all the above bodies should be located in New York at the seat of the United Nations;that  if,  for any reason,  it proves impossible to locate the majority of the Specialised Agencies inquestion in &quot;New York,  they should all be locatedat Geneva provided the Economic and Social divisions of the United Nations are also located at geneva and subject to 1/2)  above.Report C.      Co-ordination of IntergovernmentalOrganisations.l. I entirely agree with the conclusions of the working party and the Minister of State on this matter.      I would onlyadd that,  rather than depend upon being able to deal withthese questions piecemeal as they arise in the Economic and social Council,  the British Government should, take theinitiative in putting to the Council a comprehensive paper containing such of the principal conclusions as are suitablefor discussion in and consideration by the Council.G. A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1.2nd April,  1947-(3)(4)
