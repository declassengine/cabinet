(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET &apos; COPY NO.C. P. (47)  109S6TH MARCH,   1947CABINET :THE NEED FOR A POSITIVE BALANCE OP PAYMENTS policy memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Fuel and power in his memorandum CP. (47) 100,  the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer points out that,  if we continue on the recklesspath which we have been treading during the last eight monthswe shall have exhausted our United States Dollar Credit byFebruary next year.      The seriousness of the outlook liesnot in the fact that we are using up this credit, but thatfor the most part we are frittering it away,  and that bythe time that it is exhausted we shall have failed to takeadvantage of the breathing space which it was intended toprovide,  and shall be in little,  or no better,  a position than we were when the credit was granted to us.S. It is absolutely essential,   therefore,  that in thetime that is left to us we should take every means open to usto strengthen the position in which we shall find ourselveswhen the credit is exhausted,  even though this may, andprobably will - mean very substantial changes in the financialand commercial policies which we have been following,      Mostof the courses of possible action which we shall have toconsider are of a kind from which, for various reasons, wecannot hope at once to gain appreciable relief.      The lengthof time for which we can eke out the loan is therefore verymaterial.      From this point of view it would be very helpful if the Chancellor would circulate a note setting out the bestforecast available regarding the probable trend of prices in the United States,  for,  as he has pointed out, we havealready lost about a third of the value of the loan throughthe increase in American wholesale prices which has occurred since last. July and we shall suffer a still further loss  if those prices continue to rise during the remainder of the currency of the loan.      On the other hand, we should clearlygain some resjpite if a minor slump were to develop in theUnited States.3. In his paper CP. (47) 100,  the Chancellor stigmatisesas unjustified the dollar expenditure which we are incurringin importing food into the British and American Zones inGermany,  and. disputes the justification for increasing our purchases of sugar in order to raise the domestic ration.But as regards  the first of these cases,  he does not makeany concrete proposals,  reserving this question,  I assume,for his promised paper on our Import Programme for the period july 1947 - June 1948.4. The Chancellor does,  however,  draw two general conclusions, namely:    that we should develop our exports tothe full extent in our power, while, at the same time,
keeping our import programme within the most severe limits.I am hound to say that I feel unable to agree with either ofthese propositions if stated in this bald and unqualified way.what we need is,  in my view, a discriminatory policy under whichwe should push those exports which it is to our interest todevelop, but check or stop those exports which are injurious to our economy;    similarly as regards imports, we should certainly put an end to all those which are unnecessary, butwe should continue,  and in some cases expand,   those which arenecessary for re-equipping our industry and increasing its efficiency and pro &quot;uctivity.5. As regards exports,  we should cease to deludeourselves by the belief that there is any prospect of ourraising exports to a level 75 per cent,  above that which weachieved before the war.      To secure and. maintain such a volumeof exports, we should have to win for ourselves about a thirdof the whole of the world&apos;s export  trade,  unless  the volume of world trade increased enough to enable us to secure the desiredlevel of exports with a smaller share of world trade.      It isnot sense to suppose that any such achievement is within our -power.      We must,  therefore,  face the fact that our capacity to export goods and,  therefore,   to import goods, will be substantially less than we have hitherto assumed.      This make sit all the more necessary that we should husband most carefullythose resources which we still possess.6. There is, for example,   in my view,  no  justification forexporting goods to non-dollar countries in excess of the value ofthe goods which we need to buy from those countries.      We obtninno appreciable benefit from building up foreign balances inthose countries,  and it would b*e much better from our nationalstandpoint to employ either,  on the manufacture of other goods for export to other countries or on producing more equipment forour own industries,   the labour.now engaged in manufacturing - thegoods for which we are at present receiving no payment.7. -Another class of export which,  as a country, we cannotat present afford is the export of capital goods (such as miningmachinery,  agricultural machinery,  electrical generating plant,etc, ) of kinds which we ourselves badly need for our own purposes.I know that these are often very valuable exports and that theirdiscontinuance will often mean postponing the capture of markets,but nevertheless,   these are disadvantages which we ought to facefor we clearly have more to gain in the long run by concentrating on the re-equipment and. expansion of our industries,  thusraising the productivity of our national labour force.8. Again,  a class of exports from which we are derivingno immediate benefits are exports paid for out of sterling balances.       It is,  in my view,  quite wrong to allow countrieswhich possess large sterling balances to run those balancesdown at will when,  as  in the case of such countries as Indiaand. Egypt,  the existence of those balances is due to our having fought and won the war for them.      I feel strongly thatwe ought to block these balances before any further losses are incurred, as a preliminary to negotiating with the countries concerned agreements which are more in line with our economic position,9. Turning to imports. we should,  I consider,  distinguishclearly between those which are useful and necessary and thosewhich are unnecessary and,  from the balance of payments pointof view, positively harmful.
-10. I recognise that,  at the present time,  the totalvolenie of wholly unnecessary imports is probably relativelytrifling, but I hold nevertheless that we should now stop all such imports completely,  for the psychological harm resultingfrom the display   in our shops of luxury imports is,  Ibelieve,  considerable-      It is difficult to make the publicbelieve that we are in earnest  in our demand for increased exports in order to pay for vital imports so long as theycan see for themselves that we are allowing whollyunnecessary imports to be brought into this&apos; country.11. Tobacco.      I consider that the time has come when we should at last recognise that,  as a country, we cannot afford to continue the expenditure of about 50 millions ayear on tobacco,  about  35 millions of that amount being in dollars.      For the present crop-year we are, no doubt,largely committed by contracts into which we have alreadyentered, but we should,  I think, new make it clear by public statement that we have no intention of continuing purchaseson the present scale for the following crop-year.      This isa matter on which public opinion is,  I believe,  ready for acourageous lead from the Government and I should be in favourof making the cut substantial.      I should be quite preparedto defend a 50 per cent,  reduction  in our dollar expenditureon tobacco.      It might be possible to arrange that the cut in consumption was somewhat less by obtaining increased supplies from non-dollar countries.12. Films.      Our expenditure on films,  though much lessthan that of tobacco,   is nevertheless substantial (about 18 millions per annum)  and we should,   in my view,  consider carefully to what extent we can reasonably curtail imports.13- Food Imports.      We should certainly import as muchfood as we need to support the health of our people,  but in existing circumstances we should go no further.      Owing tothe world shortage of  food,  this is not a problem which willhave any direct bearing during the period, likely to be coveredby the remainder of the American Loan.      Looking further ahead,however, we should set ourselves now to secure an increase as soon as possible in the total volume of home-produced food.Having once decided the standard of nutrition at which weshould aim, we should determine how much of the food sorequired we can suitably produce at home,   thereby easing tothe fullest extent practicable the burden imposed by food imports on our balance of payments.      In particular,   I should like to see a substantial increase in our livestock and forthis purpose I should regard dollar expenditure on additionalfeeding stuffs (if these were obtainable)  as expenditure whichwould be thoroughly justified and should be incurred,  forthe dollars so spent would be more than recouped by thereduction which we could then make in expenditure on  thepurchase of livestock products from abroad.1h. Import of Capital Goods.      One of our greatesthandicaps at the present time is the obsolete character of much of our Industrial equipment,  for,   so long    as thispersists,  we cannot hope to achieve the improvement in productivity which it is essential that we should secure.I consider,  therefore,  that dollar expenditure on the purchaseof capital goods for the re-equipment of industry,  far from being controlled (as has been the tendency at least until recently)  should be encouraged to the full.
1 5 - pources of our Imports .       I entirely agree with t heview expressed by the Chancellor that,   so far as we are able,we should switch imports of foodstuffs and essential rawmaterials from dollar to non-dollar countries,  particularly(I woQId add)  those countries with which we have balances^For this reason,   I have always been apprehensive,  lest ouradvocacy of the proposed International Trade organisaion may lead to our shouldering commitments which will fetterour freedom of action in this matter, without giving usany countervailing advantages.      I consider that during theforthcoming negotiations at Geneva our representatives should be constantly on the watch for dangers of this hind.16. Personally,  I am of the opinion that,  so far as our commitments render it  possible,  we should do well toenter into reciprocal agreements with countries who have for sale raw materials or other goods which we want to buyand who for their part are willing to buy goods from us.To this end, we should,  I&quot; consider,  be well advised to conclude long-term agreements under which both sides wouldmake firm commitments as to the quantities to be made available.It might be that either we or the other country concerned wouldhave to make special arrangements to this end, but anyinconvenience which such adjustments might pause to our production programme would be well worth incurring,  if theyenabled us to buy materials and other goods which would not otherwise be obtainable.      For agreements of this kind I would look specially to hard-currency countries,  for such agreements would greatly assist our exports.      I would look also tothose countries which possess governments which genuinelybelieve in planning and which, by being able to secure that effect is given to planning, would be the most likely to fulfil any engagements into which they might enter.17. Aspects of foreign policy which adversely affectthe balance of payments.      The Chancellor has referred to theheavy drain on our dollar resources imposed by our present policy of buying food lor the Germans in the British and -more indefensible still - in the American Zones in Germany.I fully agree and I consider that we should tell UnitedStates Government that we cannot afford this expenditure;  thatwe are not prepared to continue it,  and that,  rather than doso, we shall withdraw from the occupation of Germany.18. But it is not only in Germany that through the useof troops abroad we are incurring heavy expenditure,  and Iconsider that,   in view of the extreme gravity of the balanceof payments problem, we should now re-examine the whole field of oversea expenditure by the Fighting Services in order todetermine by what amount it can .be reduced.19. Use and Misuse of Manpower Resources.      During our discussions on the Defence Estimates,  I protested against thelarge number of workers still retained in industries makingarmaments and equipment for the Fighting Services,  and I suggested that we ought to release some of this labour to generalindustry by slowing down the rate at which during the nexteighteen months or two years supplies should be manufacturedfor the Services.      Labour released in this way would be ofthe greatest value,  for it could be employed in the essential industries, whether- those manufacturing capital goods orgoods for export.      I consider that we ought now to revert tomy proposal on this subject for it offers a practical means of affording some relief to our present acute exchange difficulties.
20. Conclu sion.      My general conclusion is that weshould make s fresh approach &quot;both to the problem of exports and to that of imports.      We should stimulate valuableexports by every means in our power,  but we should put as top to those exports which are harmful,   and also those forwhich we receive no payment.      At the same time, we shouldrestrict all unnecessary imports, while expanding thoseimports which we need for the re-equipment of our industry.ELS.Ministry of Fuel and Power,  S.W.1.26th March,  19h7.
