(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET . COPY&apos;NO.      ;.....\C.P.(47)  10524TH MARCH,   1947CABINETFOOD SUPPLIES FOR THE UNITED-kingdom memorandum &quot;by the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of health the Cabinet,  at their meeting on 20th March(CM. (47) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5)  invited the comments of the Nutritional Advisers of the Ministry of Health andother Departments concerned upon the Report made byDr.  Magnus Pyke on the Nutrition, of the British People.The Minister&apos;s expert advisers have accordingly consideredDr.  Pyke&apos;s report but,   in the time available they have notbeen able to do more than make a cursory examination of thereport and arrive at provisional conclusions.2. The Minister of Health is naturally reluctant to miss any opportunity of increasing the present scale of rations.      Nevertheless his advisers  do not feel that theevidence presented &quot;by Dr.  Pyke is sufficient to- justify a conclusion that an increase of rations  is necessary onnutritional grounds.      Moreover they estimate that theproposed increase of two    ounces per week in the sugar ration would add only about 30 calories a day to theaverage diet - an- addition   which cannot,   in their opinion,he regarded as significant.3. In the light of these provisional views I feelthat the proper course would, he to refer the question tothe Standing Committee on Medical and Nutritional Problems.This is the standing expert body to whom we are accustomed to look for advice on. the scientific aspects of allnutritional questions.      Indeed,  I understand that the normal course of seeking&apos; the Committee&apos;s advice was not followed in the present case only because it was thought that time would not permit this to he done if the sugar ration is tohe increased in the next ration period.4. What,  then,   is to be done?      I have no wish to oppose the Minister of Food1s proposal if means can be foundto give effect to it.      But I am bound to advise my colleagues that no conclusion ought to be reached upon its nutritionalaspects without further examination of all the relevant information - for which reference to the Standing Committeewould he the obvious procedure.      If time does not permitthis,   then I think the decision whether or not the sugar ration should be increased must he taken on psychologicaland political,  and not on nutritional grounds.
5. The Secretary of State for Scotland informs methat his advisers are of the view that the figures quoted in Dr.  Pyke&apos;s report do not in themselves give conclusive evidence of decline in the state of national nutrition.He likewise feels that the subject should be referred tothe Standing Committee on Medical and NutritionalProblems.M inis try o f H e a It h, S. W. 1.24th March,  1.947.
