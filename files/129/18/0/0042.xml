DOCUMENT   IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1947SECRET Copy Mo..  90................ Ki x)CP. (47) 14229*/* April, 1947CABINETFINANCIAL  RELATIONS  BETWEEN  THE  EXCHEQUER ANDLOCAL   authorities memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister ofHealth and the Secretary of State for scotland the Inauguration of the National Health Service, the break-up of the remnants of the Poor Law, and changes in the trunk road system and system of road grants will result in transferring from local rates to the Exchequer such large blocks of expenditure that there must be a complete recasting of the financial relations between the Exchequer and the local authorities. The first two major changes are likely to take place on 1st April, 1948. The new financial relation-ship between the Exchequer and Local Authorities should therefore operatefrom the beginning of the 1948-49 Local Authority financial year 1st April,1948, in England and Wales, 16th May, 1948, in Scotland. These are the dateson which the present block grant arrangements come to an end in the ordinary course.2. The Government have stated on several occasions that they propose thatin this recasting the objective should be to give more assistance to the poorerareas and less to the richer areas. The proposals which we now make are designed to attain this objective and to secure that the new scheme as a wholeacts to a much greater extent than the block grant has hitherto done as a rateequaliser.3. The basic financial facts are that the first two major changes of functionreferred to would mean (on the basis of 1946-47 figures) the transfer from therates to the Exchequer of about  63 millions a year in England and Wales and 9-^ millions in Scotland, while the present block grant for that year (includingthe Supplementary Grant given by the present Government) is about  58 millions a year in England and Wales and  8-44 millions in Scotland, against whichmust be set receipts of  1 million in England and Wales and  175,000 in Scotlandfrom local authorities under the Old Age and Widows&apos; Pensions Act, 1940, giving a net figure of  57 millions in England and Wales and  8-27 millions inScotland.4. We cannot merely recoup the Exchequer approximately for the transferof functions by abolishing the existing block grant. It is the rich areas whichgain most by the transfer of functions, while it is the poor areas which receivemost out of the present block grant. Thus the London County Council would gain over  13 millions a year from the transfer and, if the whole of theirblock grant were withdrawn, they would still benefit by more than  8 millions ayear. Glamorgan, on the other hand, would gain about  1^ millions on thetransfer, but, if their block grant were withdrawn, they would lose, on balance, -1 million a year. Although, therefore, the abolition of the present block grantis the natural starting point for the necessary reforms, some new block grantmust replace it, not merely to cancel the losses of the poorer areas, but alsoto give them the further help which it is the Government&apos;s intention to give.Moreover, in view of the sums involved, some part of the money for the poorerareas must come out of the gains of the richer areas.[33533]
5. The new block grant which we propose will go entirely to the poorerareas. The proposal is that the average rateable value per head of populationover the whole country should be ascertained (population for this purposeincluding some weighting for the number of children), that a corresponding figure,allowing for differences in the general level of valuation, should be fixed forScotland, and that, if in any county or county borough or large burgh theactual rateable value is less than is required to give this average for theauthority in question, the additional rateable value necessary shall be credited to the local authority and rates on this credited rateable value shall be paid bythe Exchequer. No local authority, therefore, will have to strike any higher rate than it would have done had its rateable value been up to the average.8. The only practical method of transferring part of the gains of the richerauthorities to the poorer authorities is to reduce the present rate of exchequer grant to the richer authorities for one or more of the specific services, such aseducation, police, &amp;c. The largest of these grants is that for education which isnow nearly  100 millions a year in England and Wales and  12-f millions inScotland, and is increasing each year. The Minister of Education has agreedto a redistribution of education grants and has devised a provisional formulaunder which the richer areas get much less than now, while the poorer areas getmuch more. The precise for IT! i j-1 ti is still under discussion between the chancellor and the Minister of Education, but the principle of so using the grant is agreed.Appropriate adjustments would be made in the Scottish education grant whichwill continue to be fixed at ll-80ths of the English&apos;figure.7. The total cost of the proposed new block grant with the new scheme ofeducation grants in operation would have been about  34 millions a year inEngland and Wales and  5-7 millions in Scotland if it had been in operation in1946-47. The additional cost to the exchequer uer in 1948-49 of the scheme we propose as a whole (but based on the expenditure in 1946-47) would be England andWales Scotland , millions          millionsTransferred   expenditure   (hospitals   and out-relief) .............      63 9-5New Block Grant     ...      ...       ...      ...      34 5-7Cessation of contributions by local authori-ties under Old Age and Widows&apos; Pen-sions Act, 1940 ............        1 0-1798 15-37Less existing Block Grant ...       ...       ...      58 8-4440 6-93In addition the Exchequer becomes liable for additional grants to Local health authorities towards the cost of services provided under the National health service Act       ............        5 0-75Additional cost ...       ......      45 7-688. In comparison with 1947-48 the additional cost in 1948-49 would be 1 million less in England and Wales 137,000 in Scotland because, for theyear commencing April 1947, the Interim Supplementary Grant goes up by theseamounts.9. The net gains of local authorities would be  40 millions in Englandand Wales and  6-93 millions in Scotland, compared with their position in1946-47 or  39 millions and  6-8 millions compared with 1947-48, the differences of  5 millions and  750,000 between these gains and the additional cost to theExchequer being the cost of the additional services to be provided by localauthorities under Part III of the National Health Service Act and the corres-ponding Scottish Act.10. On the basis of expenditure in 1946-47 the average rate levied inEngland and Wales would come down from 15s. 5d. to 12s. 8d.; that in theadministrative counties, other than London, from 15s. 9d, to 12s. lid.; that in thecounty boroughs from 16s. 5d. to 13s. 8d.; and that in London from 12s Qd. to
105. 2d. Iii Scotland, the average rate woald fall from 13s. 7d. to 10s. Qd.; thatin counties from 13s. Id. to 9s. 8d.; and that in large burghs from 13s. Qd.to 10s. lOd.11. The improvement in development areas is very striking. On the 1946-47figures the rates in Durham come down from 18s. 11 d. to 12s. Id.; those inGlamorgan from 22s. lid. to 13s.; and those in Monniouth from 21s. lid. to8s. Qd. Illustrative changes as regards rates in county boroughs in the develop-ment areas are as follows : The rates in Gateshead come down from 24s. to14s. Id.; those in South Shields from 18s. 10d to 12s. Qd.; those in Sunderlandfrom 17s. Qd to 10s. 8d.; and those in Merthyr Tydfil from 30s. to 13s. Id. InScotland the rates in Lanarkshire would come down from 17s. Id. to 9s. 10d.; in glasgow from 16s. lid. to 12s. lid.; in Clydebank from 16s. to 13s. 4d.; in Coat-bridgre from 19s. Id. to 10s. Qd.; and in Dundee from 15s. 2d. to 12s. od. (It willbe borne in mind that in view of the differences in the level of valuation theEnglish equivalent of a Scottish rate is approximately 25 per cent, above theScottish figure.)12. The foregoing summary, which deals with the changes arising fromthe introduction of the National Health Service, the transfer to the exchequer of responsibility for out-relief, the proposed new formula for the Education grant and the review of the Block Grant, ignores further proposed changes affectingthe expenditure of local authorities and the grants payable by the Exchequer,e.g., the proposals in the Fire Services Bill under which counties and county boroughs will incur expenditure estimated at  12^ millions per annum inEngland and Wales and  1^- millions in Scotland, and receive specific exchequer grants of some  3 millions and  300,000 respectively. This new Block Grantscheme automatically ensures, however, that in all but the richer counties and county boroughs which will receive no block grant, the effect on rates of these further proposals will be graded according to the financial resources of the counties and county boroughs.13. There is one supplemental matter which we must mention. The new scheme provides an opportunity for getting rid of certain financial adjustmentsbetween local authorities when boundaries are altered. A note explaining theposition is appended to this paper.14. When the general principles of the new scheme are approved the nextstep will be to consult the Associations of Local Authorities. In that consultation,we must maintain the principles underlying the new scheme, but localauthorities will no doubt have points of detail to raise. One matter of substancewhich they will probably raise is that of derating on which they may press forthe abolition of the derating of industry and possibly of agriculture. We areclear that this demand cannot be conceded. It would be a retrograde step of aserious order, and in particular would bear particularly hardly on industry in thehigher rated parts of the country and would undermine the efforts which havebeen and are being made to attract industries to development areas.15. The discussions with the local authorities should take place as soon aspossible. The Bill should be ready for introduction at the beginning of next session and should be passed quickly. Local authorities start making their ratesin January and February and will accordingly have to be told during January,1948 what their new grants will be.16. The proposed new scheme carries out the announced intentions of theGovernment so to modify the financial relations between the Exchequer and thelocal authorities that the poorer authorities would have adequate financial resources to maintain a proper level of local services. We seek the agreement ofour colleagues to the scheme and propose to open negotiations with the associations of Local Authorities on this basis.H. D.A. B.J. W.2Mh April, 1947.
APPENDIXAdjustments on Alteration of BoundariesUnder the present law when a local authority extends by taking in part ofthe area of another local authority there is a financial adjustment between the twoauthorities. Apart from the adjustment due to the transfer of physicalassets and liabilities, there is an estimation of the effect of the transfer on therate payers&apos; position so much rateable value is lost or gained, so much money willbe saved on the cost of service, so much money will be lost by way of grant, &amp;e,and an agreed sum, usually arrived at by hard bargaining, is paid by one authority to the other in respect of any &quot; increase of burden.&quot;The Association of Municipal Corporations have asle . for the abolition ofthese financial adjustments, and take the view that if the relative financialposition of the parties is altered by a change of area or status the alterationshould, so far as necessary, be taken into account in an adjustment of the block grant and that that should be sufficient. The Count;/ Councils Association are opposed to this view, but they agree that theoretically it would be possible to makeany necessary adjustment through a block grant system.When the proposed.new scheme of grants is examined from this point ofview, it would seem that it goes far towards making any other adjustmentsunnecessary. The grant would be revised annually, and its whole object, particu-larly if the last-mentioned method of calculation is used, is to ensure that eachlocal authority has financial resources up to the average. If therefore a changein area worsens the position of an already-poor area, it will still, by means of thenew grant, be brought up to the average. The only areas whose ratepayers would lose by the abolition of financial adjustment between local authorities would be those areas with financial resources above the average both before and after the changes in area or function. But it can be said that such areas have no goodclaim to compensation, especially when it is considered that the claim might be against a poorer area, since the changes will have been made in the general interest of local government and the services which it administers, and will havebeen designed to secure effective and economic units of administration.On the whole therefore it is suggested that with the inception of the net?system of grants the system of payments by one local authority to another (exceptin respect of physical assets and liabilities) should be abolished.
