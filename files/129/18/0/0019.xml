OPBRTY OF HIS BRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S G(Printed for the Cabinet.   March 19471796 kj*G^opy No.CP. (47) 1193l$t March, 1947CABINETPOWER STATION AT BANKSIDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for air in paragraph 9 of paper OP. (47) 110, a brief reference is made to the strategic objections to the Rotherhithe site for a new power station. I ought toamplify this point.2. The general strategic considerations bearing on the location of power stations were set out in OP. (46) 307, which dealt primarily with the objectionsto the proposal to establish a power station at Poplar. When this station was approved by the Defence Committee on 1st November, 1946, the Prime Ministerexpressed the hope that in future the strategic considerations would be fully considered before any steps were taken to construct similar installations.3.   The strategic factors affecting Rotherhithe follows : (a) There is already within a circle of less than 2 miles radius i.e., withinthe effective radius of an atom bomb a concentration of electricity generating capacity, actual or approved, of over 1 million kilowatts,representing some 8-1 per cent, of the country&apos;s total generating capacity. The addition of 315,000 kilowatts at Rotherhithe would raise this percentage to 11 per cent. Surely we should seek to avoidincreasing these already excessively heavy concentrations.(6) The Rotherhithe site lies in a heavy concentration of key-points, the major ones of which are the docks, principally the India Docks, SurreyDocks and Victoria Docks. In a future war these docks would be almost certain to have a high priority as targets for air attack. TheRotherhithe station would therefore stand a good chance of being destroyed even if power stations were not the enemy&apos;s primary objectof attack.4. Bankside is also open to strategic objection. It is only 3 miles furtherup river, and in an area which would certainly be attacked in war. It is close to such key-points as London Bridge Station, Waterloo, and the vulnerable con-centration of railway lines on the approaches to Charing Cross, and to the seat of Government. There are a number of industrial key-points in the vicinity,including large installations for storing and processing food. My department has not pressed its objections against the project in the past, because it is aquestion of extending an existing station rather than building a new one, and because we have been confronted with a choice of evils. But because Banksideis less objectionable than Rotherhithe or Poplar, it does not follow that the heart of London is a good place strategically to add another 125,000 kilowatts of generating capacity.5. Accordingly. I must register strong objection on strategic grounds to both projects, and still more to the combination of them.   I find it difficult[33389]
to believe that in these days power stations have to be located in the middleof urban areas, and I think that other sites should be examined urgently. Mydepartment mentioned, when the Poplar station was being considered, four sitesfurther down river which were strategically less objectionable (Annex II to cp. (46) 307), and I think that the possibility of a site on the Lea should notbe overlooked. Any site will have its disadvantages, but I doubt if they wouldbe more formidable than the engineering and other difficulties at Rotherhithe.P. J. N.-B.Air Ministry, 31st March, 1947.
