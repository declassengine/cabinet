AGRICULTURAL LOSSES AND ARREARS DUE TOWINTER WEATHER AND FLOODS&quot;Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for scotland as the position in England is materially different from that in Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and Iare submitting separately the reports which the Cabinet(CM. (47) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 9)  invited us to circulate on the question of compensating farmers forlosses caused &quot;by the severe winter and recent floods.2. Careful observations carried, out during the past few weeks in most of the districts in Scotland which areliable to flooding indicate that no major flooding disasterhas occurred,  and while the danger is not yet over incertain areas,  there appears at present to he no case forspecial relief measures so far as flood damage is concerned.If however any decision is come to which involves compensationfor flood damage of the kind to which low lying lands are at times liable in more normal seasons,  the application of thedecision to Scotland would, require further consideration.3. There is no doubt that the prolonged frost and heavy snowstorms have caused, considerable loss of sheep and. will result in a poor lamb crop.      Prom very tentativeestimates by my Departments Crop Reporters and AgriculturalExecutive Committees it appears that losses in all classesof sheep in Scotland, will be over b% above normal (approxi-mately 300,000 out of a total of five and a half.million),and that there may be an over-all drop in lambing percentages of 20% (400,000).      Over-all losses  of cattle appear tohave been negligible,  though they may have been severe inisolated cases.4. It is likely that losses will also be incurred by farmers in respect of delayed sowing and poor yields ofcrop, waste and delay in transport of potatoes,  etc.5. It is not possible at this date to make any exactestimate of losses under either of the heads mentioned inparagraphs 3 and 4, but it Is clear that substantial and widespread damage,  including much of a consequential ratherthan immediate character, v/ill have been suffered.      Inthese circumstances it seems to me necessary that anycompensation scheme should extend to Scotland,  theprinciples of the distribution of that compensation tobe worked out later.J.W.Scottish Office, S.W.I.28th March,  1947.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)setting-S-^-J-I COPY NO. ^ iCP.
