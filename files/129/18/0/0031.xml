THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)3 SJ:::C.&apos; RE :copy NO.19th April, 1 947*CABINETTHE INDUSTRIAL ORGANISATION bill memorandum by the Minister of Labour and Nationai service this Bill received a Second Reading on 13th February,1947-      It is likely to be taken in Standing Committee shortly.Both before it was introduced and since I have been in communication with the President of the Board of Traderegarding certain amendments which I think it is necessary tointroduce into the Bill.      On certain points,  to which I attach the utmost importance, we have net been able to reach agreement and I regret that I must ask the Cabinet to decidethese issues which are set out briefly below.Safeguarding of the position  of Government Departments2. Several of the    functions proposed to be assigned to Development Councils are at present exercised by myDepartment - e.g.  functions relating to training (item 8 ofthe Schedule to the Bill), to the adoption of measures forsecuring safer and better working conditions  (item 9),  torecruitment (item 11)  and others.      No doubt other departments are similarly concerned.      I am advised that the entrusting of functions to a statutory body like a Development Council mayprejudice the exercise of similar functions by a GovernmentDepartment, especially in cases where the Department exercisesthem not by virtue of statutory authority but as a matter of administrative policy.       In order to safeguard the positionof my own and other Departments I suggested to the Presidentof the Board of Trade the inclusion in the Bill of words onthe following lines -&quot;Any functions assigned by a Development Council order shall not be taken as prejudicing the operation ofany functions for the time being exercisable by a secretary of State or a Minister of the Crown&apos;&apos;1.3- The President has not felt able to accept thissuggestion but  states that he does &quot;not rule out thepossibility of inserting in Development Council Orders,wherever this seems necessary,   some special safeguard in the shape of a formula requiring the Councils in exercising their functions to have regard to work being done in the same fieldby other bodies,  including Government.Departments&quot;.4. I cannot regard a formula couched in such elasticterms as in any way meeting my point and while I would much prefer an amendment to the Bill,  I must press for an assurance that the Development Council Orders will includeadequate safeguards on the lines of the formula set out inparagraph 2 above.
Recruitment5, Among the functions which may he assigned to a development Council is -&quot;Promoting or undertaking arrangements for encouraging the entry of persons into the industry.&quot;    (item 11  ofthe Schedule).This raises issues similar to those referred toin the  preceding paragraphs,  but raises them in a more, seriousform, for in this case the Development Councils are given power not only to promote but actually to undertake arrangementsfor recruiting.      Accordingly the formula proposed earlier(paragraph 2 above)  is not adequate in the case of recruitment.6, My Department has a general responsibility for the recruitment and allocation of labour.      There is an acute shortage of labour for essential work.      Yet under thisproposal any Development Council would be at liberty to embark on an  intensive recruitment campaign for its own industry without regard to the general situation or to theneeds of other industries.      The work of my Department in trying to steer labour where it was most needed could thuseasily be vitiated and confusion will clearly result unless there is some central control over the recruitment activitiesof these statutory bodies.7. I therefore regard it as absolutely essential thatthe functions of Development Councils in the field of recruitment should be exercised only in agreement with myDepartment and&apos;that provision to this effect should beincluded either in the Bill or in  each Development CouncilOrder.Consultation with Joint Bodies of Employers and Workers priorto the establishment of Development Councils8. The Bill  provides (Clause 1(3)) for consultation,prior to the making of a Development Council Order, with(l)    organisations representative of substantial numbersof persons carrying on business in the industry;(2)    organisations representative of workers in theindustry;.An earlier draft of the Bill  provided also for consultation with joint organisations of employers and workers, -whether.statutory or voluntary, which have beenestablished for the -   purpose of settling remuneration  andconditions of employment.      At the instance of the Presidentof the Board of Trade,   the Legislation Committee decided totake out this provision.9* On reconsideration  I feel very strongly that thisprovision should be re-inserted in the Bill.      The existing provision relating to consultation with employers&apos;organisations  (see paragraph 8(1)  above) has reference toorganisations on the commercial side of industry such astrade associations,  and not to employers&apos;   organisations which deal with labour matters,  and which are specially concerned with many of the questions proposed-to be entrusted
to Development Councils.      Moreover the joint bodies in question(joint industrial councils, wages councils,  etc.) in many Instancesalready have responsibility for several of the functions which  theBill assigns to Development Councils.      For these reasons I am satisfied that it is essential that the appropriate joint body should be consulted as such before the making of a development council Order.-10. The President of the Board of Trade,  I understand,agrees as to the principle of consulting these joint bodies andthe only difference between us is whether specific provisionrequiring consultation  should be re-inserted in the Bill.      i feel most strongljr that this should be done both in order toestablish the. position of these joint bodies in relation to theDevelopment Councils and in order to safeguard the future.      TheBritish Employers&apos;  Confederation, which is the body mainly concerned since the position of.the Federation of BritishIndustries and the Trad.es Union Congress is already safeguarded by the existing provisions reierred to in paragraph 8 above,  havemade strong representations to me on the matter and I must pressmy colleagues to agree  to the necessary provision being re-inserted in the Bill.Statistics11. Under Section 3(2) Development Councils will be able,with the consent of the Board of Trade or Minister concerned,  to demand information, and statistics on a large number of matters,including staff and costs,   the latter of which might includeinformation about wages.       It is most undesirable that DevelopmentCouncils should be given the authority to duplicate the demandsof Government Departments in the matter of statistics and to double the burden already placed on industry.      All the painfulwork which has been put in over the last few years with a viewto securing uniformity ox   statistics could easily be largelyvitiated.      The right course is for Development Councils to obtain their statistics from the Government Department concerned or,  ifit is regarded as essential to give them the authority includedin the Bill,   to make the exercise of that authority subject tothe consent of&quot;such of the competent authorities referred to in the statistics of Trade Act as may be concerned.&quot;I ask ray colleagues to agree that the necessary amendmuntshould be made in the Bill.G.
