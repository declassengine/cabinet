titft DOOM MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT )I S^Li^^I copY ^cz^4:zS.jto225TM APRIL.   1947CABINETPROPOSED SCHEME FOR PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OFSECTIONS OF THE IRON AND STEEL industry memorandum by the Minister of supply in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 24th April(CM. (47) 39th Conclusions,  Minute 6) of the schemesummarised in CP. (47) 123 attention was mainly concentrated on the three following questions:-(a) It was thought that if Stock Exchange prices were taken as  the basis for valuation the State wouldmake excessive payments for obsolete orobsolescent assets in the steel industry.      Thefurther point was made that steel shares werestanding at levels which could, not have been attained but for the protection, given by theState to the industry over the last fifteen years.(b) The suggestion was made that the objectives ofGovernment policy might be secured if compulsory acquisition by the State wore confined to 51% ofthe securities belonging to the more importantiron and steel producing companies.(c) Some doubt was expressed as to the wisdom of theproposal that,  at any rate in the Initial stage,the form of organisation of the publicly ownedindustry should be based on the retention ofthe company structure.2. I think that it might be useful if I let mycolleagues have a brief statement of my views on each of theab o v e q u e s t i. o ns,Purchase on the basis of Stock Exchange prices3. Some of the assets to &quot;be transferred in the caseof transport were said, to be in a sorry condition.      but nevertheless on both transport and electricity the Governmentconsistently maintained, that Stock Exchange prices gave afair and objective valuation of the assets to be transferred.I should find it impossible to argue the contrary for ironand steel.4. As regards the influence of State protection,  theOfficial Committee on the Socialisation of Industries said
in their First Report  (S. I. (0 )(46) 12),  which wasapprover! by Ministers t -&quot;&quot;/e have come to the conclusion that  it would heunprofitable to attempt to make any allowance for such State action as the maintenance of tariff barriers or restrictions on imports  in arriving at the figure of compensation.      Evenif the effects of such State action could bedisentangled from the many other circumstances which have affected an industry&apos;s profits,  theindustry could justly argue that the action wastaken not in its own interest but  in that of thenation at large and that it was usuallyaccompanied by conditions which limited theprofits which might have resulted from it.&quot;I agree with,  and have followed,  this advice.5. The only practicable alternative to stock exchange prices is valuation by an independent tribunalwith terms of reference so drawn as to cover all relevant considerations,  including the condition of the physicalassets to be transferred.      But this course would presentmost formidable difficulties:-(a) It would be impossible to arrive quickly at anyoverall- global figure for the whole industry.There is nothing equivalent to the agreedprofit figures running over a long pre-war period which were available  in the coalindustry.(b) Thus it would be necessary to assess individuallypayments in respect of the securities of over100 companies.      This would  inevitably involvegreat delay and expense.      The work wouldtake at least two to three years.(c) The services of the necessary skilled personnel,e.g. valuers and accountants, could be obtainedonly at the expense of other important work.(d) In presenting its case before such a tribunal,Government would probably experience greatdifficulty in marshalling expert and weightyopinion to counterbalance the influence ofthose directors and senior executives fromthe industry who would prefer to assist the presentation of the shareholders&apos;   case.(This was a point particularly emphasised bythe Treasury in discussion with them.)6. It by no means follows  that Government would payless in total for the quoted securities  if they were referred to a tribunal.      My own view is that government might well pay more.7. My conclusion - with which the Treasury haveagreed in the detailed discussions which have takenPlace with them - is that there will be no practicable
alternative except to &quot;base payment on Stock Exchange prices.And. I say this in the full realisation that if market-prices are adopted Government will inevitably be exposed to a torrentof criticism that this method will not only provide a grosslyinadequate amount to the shareholders, but will also be1    peculiarly unfair in the case of the iron and steel industry,especially between company and company, because the marketI    for its securities has not been so fully informed as in theI    cases of railways and electricity.Extent of share acquisitionI    8. If Government is to obtain effective control overI    the steel companies,  it must be in a position to secure thepassing of special and extraordinary resolutions (which arenecessary to remove directors,.to bring about amalgamations,I    etc.).      These require a 75% vote.      Thus, GovernmentI    ownership of only 51% of the voting capital is obviouslyI out of the question:    the minimum is 75%,9. But the continuance of any private holding in asocialised industry would be intolerable.      The only functionII of such a minority shareholding would be to receive a returnI   on its investment higher than that given on ordinaryI   Government stock but for no real risk or services, whileit would always be -possible for the private shareholders byappeals to the Courts to obstruct the application ofGovernment policy to the companies  concerned.s; 10. I must therefore emphasise that only the acquisition1 of 100% of the voting capital of the industry will be&apos;m consistent with the objectives of Government policy in1 socialising this industry.Retention of the Company structureB   11. I cannot do better on this than quote the following a   passage from the paper which I submitted to the Committee onthe Socialisation of Industries (S-. I. (M) (47 ) 13):-&quot;The introduction of public ownership by the acquisitionI of companies does not in itself predetermine the subseouentH organisation of the State-owned industry.........  Under thisp.:procedure the benefits of the service contracts, patents and design rights,  commercial arrangements,  standing raw-materialII contracts and the like would be maintained unbroken;S considerations of long-standing commercial reputation, goodwill,m consumers&quot;&apos;  preference, trade names and the like,  so important in highly competitive export markets, would be safeguarded;H feelings of loyalty to,   and pride in,   individual companies wouldV  De conserved;    while the disturbance attendant on transferll would be sensibly reduced by reason of the maintenance intactI 2, comPanies&apos;  organisations.      Moreover,   I should hopeIf that the retention of the identity and. the partial autonomyM of individual companies would enable the proposed centralM. authority, while securing the benefits and economies of hire large-scale integration,   to ensure at the same time them maintenance of a degree of competition between the Individualm units, sufficient to avoid the&quot;rigidity and loss of efficiencyH-Which might in this  industry befall a completely &quot;streamlined&quot;II, monopoly.
** fit pj2d /&quot;It may &quot;be objected that the company structure is tosome extent fortuitous and. illogical and may not corresponds to the real organisational needs of the industry.      -Anothercriticism may he that the procedure will tend to crystallise,the status quo and to keep &quot;old guard&quot;  directors in&quot; officeirrespective of their efficiency.      But I should proposeto make it abundantly clear to Parliament that no passivereproduction of the status quo is contemplated;    theproposed central, authority would have powers enabling itto amalgamate, wind up or reorganise companies and to creatnew companies or new functional authorities.      Equally,  Ishould emphasise that one of the first directions which Ishould issue to the central authority would be that theyshould prune and reorganise as necessary existing boards of directors,  adding where appropriate directors drawn from the ranks of the workers.&quot;12. The more I consider this subject,  the more I ameconvinced that it will be right to retain the companystructure,  at all events at the outset.       In extendingpublic ownership to the iron and steel industry the state will be breaking new ground,  since it will be acceptingdirect responsibility for a highly complex industry composeof units of diverse size and character engaged on a great variety of processes,  and  largely living by the sale of products made to individual specifications to individualbuyers both in this country and in highly competitive markeabroad.      I am sure that,  given the nature of this industry it will be essential to adopt a form of organisation which,while securing effective public control and the advantages of unified ownership), will at the same time be best calculated to maintain overall efficiency by the continuedencouragement of individual initiative and enterprise atthe company level.J.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2.25th April,  1947.
