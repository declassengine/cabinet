a/?   x   ri(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.&apos;)secret.P.(U7)  106 COPY NO.25TH MARCH ,  1947CABINETOPERATION OP LIBERTY SHIPS BY GERMAN CREWSMemorandum by the Chancellor of  the Duchy of LancasterDuring his recent visit to Germany, Mr. Hooverrecommended that about 75 American Liberty ships should bemade available to the Combined Zones to cover their importsof food and essential raw materials.      These  ships would bemade available either free or alternatively the charter hirewould be paid in marks,  the foreign exchange equivalent ofwhich would not be recovered by the Americans until after a balance of payments in the Combined Zones had been achieved.2. This proposal,  which is now being officiallysubmitted to Congress by the United States authorities,would if accepted effect a very considerable  saving in expenditure in the costs of operating the Combined Zoneswhich would otherwise have to come from the British and american taxpayers.      The precise amount of saving will depend upon the  trade in which these ships were employed,but Mr.  Hoover has estimated it at 01+0 million.      TheUnited States appropriation estimates for the financialyear 1st July,  1947 to 30th June,  1946,  include $3U million for transportation costs and Mr.  Hoover&apos;s estimate ispresumably based on  the supplies purchased against theseappropriations and those for the current financial yearbeing carried in these Liberty ships.      Since the Americansonly provide 50 per cent,  of German requirements and sincethe number of ships involved is sufficient to carry goodspurchased under British as well as American appropriatedfunds,  the savings should be considerably larger and mightb^ nearly double  this figure.3. I am not at this stage in a. position to give anydetails as to the manner in which the ships would be operatedor the trade on which &quot;they would be employed.      These matters,together with any conflicts which Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposals may cause with existing quadripartite decisions in regard to german merchant shipping are at present under considerationby an Anglo-American Working party in Berlin.      It is clear,however,  that the American Element  of the Control commission is strongly in favour of the proposal and does not intend tobe deterred from supporting it by any opposition that may beraised by the Russian or French elements of the control commission.      The British element of the Control commission is also in favour of its acceptance, and have aoked us tosupport it with the United States authorities.
0 QCoh. Although Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposal is highlyattractive from the financial point of view,  it raises certain other issues on which I seek the guidance of the Cabinet.5&apos; First,  there is the  security aspect,      Mr. Hooverdescribes his proposals as being of a temporary nature.Nevertheless,  they would presumably remain in force until a balance of payments has been achieved for the Combined Zones.This is unlikely to occur before the end of 19h9 at theearliest and since the continued operation of Liberty ships by the Germans after that date might permit of some repayment of sums already advanced by the British anu american governments in  respect of German civilian imports,  there isa strong probability that we should be faced with pressure from the Americans to continue the arrangement for an indefinite period thereafter.      The operation by the Germanseven on a temporary basis of a merchant marine of the sizeenvisaged would be likely to involve the retention in germany of larger repair facilities than we at present envisage.It can also be argued that Mr.  Hoover&apos;s proposal-would tendto preserve in being German skilled seamanship which theAdmiralty are so anxious to see eliminated on security grounds;    though in my opinion it  is doubtful whether this can ever be achieved.      Finally,  if the present proposal were accepted on the grounds that Germany needed this shipping tosecure a balance of payments it would provide a strong case for relaxing the present prohibition on the German ship-building industry.      At the meeting of  the OverseasReconstruction Committee on 26th February (O.R.C. (h7) 3&apos;rdMeeting)  consideration was given as to whether the presentban on German shipbuilding should be retained or whether she should be allowed to buila a limited mercantile marine.Both the Minister of Defence and the First Lord of theAdmiralty were strongly opposed to any relaxation of the banand it was finally agreed that the Foreign Secretary &quot;would refer back for farther instructions if in the light of had discussions at Moscow he thought  it desirable to propose any revision of the Potsdam decision.6. The position of the United Kingdom has also to beconsidered.      At present we are providing about 10 british ships per month to lift grain and other goods from. north american ports for Germany.      This represents about 20 percent,  of the  total tonnage involved.      We hope to be able toincrease these numbers later in the year and eventually tocarry   in British bottoms at least 50 per cent,  of the cargooffered.      If the bulk of trade with Germany were to becarried in Liberty ships &quot;the financial gain which the UnitedKingdom could expect to derive from Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposal would be reduced by the extent to which these British ships were unable to obtain alternative freights.      The overalldollar saving would, however,  still remain, since the freighton United Kingdom Government shipments to the Combined Zoneis payable  in sterling.7* In asking for a decision on whether or not we should oppose Mr. Hoover&apos; s proposals I would draw the -attention ofmy colleagues to the political consequences of refusal.The American offer is a generous one in that they are apparently willing to accept either no charter hire ordeferred payment terms.      To oppose the proposal would be
tc deny to the American as well as the British taxpayersubstantial financial relief in the costs of meetingGermany&apos;s essential import requirements/ and however,strongly we stress the security implications our action would certainly be regarded as being based on our owncommercial interests.      If  the three-year programme laid,down in the Fusion Agreement for  achieving a balance ofpayments in the Combined Zone failed to materialise theadditional expenditure to be borne out of  subsequentappropriations would be laid at our uoor and the Americansmight well refuse to continue to bear as much.as 50 per cenof the combined costs.J.B.H.Control Office for Germany and Austria,S.VV. 1. j25th March, 19U7.
