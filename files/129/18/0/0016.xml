(47)  32ndConclusions, Minute 9  (3)   )   the Cabinet asked the Secretary  ofState for Scotland and myself to circulate, for their consideration on 1st ivpril, a memorandum   on the question of compensating farmersfor losses caused by  the severe winter and  the receAt&apos; flooSs.      Thismemorandum deals with England and Wales.      The situation and/,problems in Scotland are different in some respects and are being dealt with by  the Secretary of State in a separate memorandum.LOOSES OF CROPS nND STOCK2.      The Cabinet will appreciate that it is only possible at thisstage to put forward a rough interim estimate of the farming losses.The losses of livestock, particularly hill sheep and lambs, due toexposure and starvation cannot  yet be accurately assessed;      losses of crops and stock due to flooding are still taking place in some areas:    even where the floods have started to recede it is still  too early to estimate the extent of the damage;.      The following,  however,is an appreciation of the position as far as it could be ascertained&apos;by my local officers during the period 21st/24th March*3.      Los36s of sheep and lambsSheep: between 950,000 and 1,000,000,  divided as toabout 700,000 hill sheep and 270,000 lowland sheep.&quot;These represent 52 per cent,  of hill sheep and 7 per   ,cent,  of lowland sheep in the respective categories.Some counties have lost up to 45-55 per cent,  of sheep.L am&quot;b a -:    approximately 1    millions, or 1.1 millions after allowing for deaths in the ordinary course.   -Total sheen and lambs:      about 2z millions.&apos;   Store cattle:      a loss of about 30,000.   . The total population is of the order of 2 i millions.Extent of floods    (31 counties):   600,000 acresoofagricultural land.Winter corn lost by flood: about 90,000 acres, almost allwheat. The total area of winter corn would be of theorder of 2 million acres,   again almost all wheat.1946 potatoesDue to floods (31 counties):    50,000 tons.Frosted  in clamps    (Great Britain as a whole):80,000 tons.(Note:      The combined losses through flood ani frost will  not inthe view of the Ministry of Pood affect consumption from the 1946crop,    The losses fall short of the quantity which the publicdid not receive during the frosts) . .
4 In spite of newspaper reports and general comment, the overallpicture is one of more serious losses in the livestock than in thearable sector, and one of more serious losses in the hills than inthe flood, areas.5.    A very rough assessment of the value of these direct losses is -Livestock.   ......Crops.  .  .   .  .  .  . . .Total 7  million:I   &amp; .CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSEolL6..    There will of course be far-reaching arid continuing effects ofthis disastrous winter..    The condition of the surviving hill sheepis extremely bad;    that of lowland sheep and of store cattle in the hills, poor.    There will be an acute shortage of feeding stuffs in 1.. .the hills until the grass begins to grow.    A late season for grasswill produce a decline in milk yields.    There may be a total lossof about 200,000 acres    in spring sowings of roots and corn.    (Thetotal area ox&quot; spring sowings would ordinarily be about 3,600,000&amp;.cres.)   Late sowings will reduce yields.    Probably some 200,000acres of winter corn killed by frost will have to be re-sown.    the indirect losses will in value terms exceed the direct losses, andI estimate them at  Qh millions in. England and //ales.GOMPEN SAT 1 PIT proposals.    My proposals for compensation are as follows:rThe immediate distress and losses caused by snow, frost andflood can, I suggest, be considered broadly under four heads -(a) Domestic and household - It is the purpose, as I understandit,  of the Lord Mayor1s fund,  supplemented by localrelief funds, to assist in this class of case.    occupiers of farmhouses and farm cottages in the flooded areaswho have suffered personal and household losses should in my view be eligible in that respect for assistancefrom these Funds.(b) Direct losses of crops and stock due to winter we ather andfloods - My present proposals,  sot out below,  are designedto deal with these -purely agricultural losses.(c) Indirect losses, e.g.  loss of profit on sheep, lambs andcattle killed by the weather, and on crops on flooded land.There will for example be a severe loss of income in hilldistricts extending for at least three years.    I consider these losses call for assistance both by way of goods andseiwices, or cash loans, and. by some readjustment of thefinancial help available under the Hill Farming Act, 1946.Proposals, which will have to be carefully integrated withthe scheme outlined below,  are being worked out.(d) General rehabilitation,. e.g.  repair and replacement of buildings, plant, fences, roads, restoration of drainagesystems, etc.    This set of problems involves in the maingrants  to local authorities, Catchment Boards and otherdrainage authorities, and will clearly require special consideration.    I have riot dealt with it in this memorandum.8.    Corivpensation scheme for losses of crops and stocks due to winterweather and floodsI propose that the N.P.U. should be invited to agree to the raising of a fund by the following means:-
(a) Voluntary levies on sales of milk, fat stock and eggs l47during an agreed period.      The levy on milk can readily be collected by the Milk Marketing Board and those onfat stock and eggs by the Ministry of Pood.(b) Voluntary contributions direct to the Fund  (e.g.from fruit farmers, market gardeners, and amble farmerswho have not suffered severe losses from the snow and floods)an( that the Government should offer to contribute to this Fund on a  for   basis.9.     Direct losses are at present, as stated in paragraph 5 above,estimated at  7 millions but they may well amount to more.      The  &quot;&quot;size of the voluntary levies would of course have to be decided by the farmersthemselves but the following ready reckoner indicates the amounts whichcould be raised:-A levy	of	Id.per	gal.on m	Ilk sales	in jripril	to	J une	would produce	1,440,000il         it	11	10/-&quot;	head&apos; &quot; fa	t cattle									sold	1!             11	ii	ii	ii        &quot;	100,000tl         H	1!	2/- &quot;	ii    ii    ii	she ep									bOlU	11             ii	ii	ii	1!                11	50,000il         &quot;	11	3A  &quot;	11         11         i i	pigs			,						sold	11             11	11	ii	ii         ii	40 ,000ii            h	!!

The Fund would be administered by a national committee composedof representatives of ray Department,  of County War xigricu Itural ExecutiveCommittees  (chosen from the worst hit counties)   and the N.F.U.      ThisCommittee would lay down ihe general principles to be followed,  e.g.  that account would have to be  taken of receipts from insurance, and wouldallocate  quotas to counties.        These quotas would be administered inaccordance with the principles laid down by the national committee byad hoc county committees composed of two or three representatives of theC.W.A .E. C.   (my agents)  and an equal number of representatives selected by the County Branch of the N .F.IJ.11.      I propose(a) that the Milk Marketing   Board and  the Ministry of food should make no charge for the collection of the agreed levieson milk, fat stock and eggs;  and that the Ministry of agriculture ahould  make no  change for administration services and any formsand stationery required.(b) that members of the national and county committees should beinvited to give their services voluntarily and should beprovided,  without charge, with the necessary secretarial assistance jointly by the CW.we.Ci.  and the County Branchof the N.F.U. ;(o)    that  if,  as is almost inevitable, payments exceed receiptsin the early stages,  the Government should,  in addition toits own contribution,  advance if necessary, free of intereot,up to,  say, RO per cent,  of the estimated yiel-3 of the  levies,against subsequent recoupment.12.    This scheme has the merits that  it provides for a substantial contribution from the farming community themselves, that it will becomparatively simple to administer,  that ilhe assessment of claimswill be in the bands of persons with local knowledge and that it will not create embarrassing precedents,  since a national levy from farmersthemselves Is an essential feature of it,  and this is not likely to be repeated except on the occurrence of a widespread disaster of similarmagnitude.
FOOD PRODUCTION PROSPECTS AND RE0.UIREMENTS15.   The food production prospects, for the immediate future asregards cropsf and for sonic time ahead as regards livestock, are extremely serious.     As the Prime Minister said in his broadcast on16th March; &quot;the wet autumn had already held up work on the land and now snow, frost and floods have damaged crops already sown, delayedspring sowing, and killed many thousands of cattle, sheep and lambs.This is a loss which will take long to make good .... the agriculturalcommunity deserve all our sympathy and help ....      It is vitally important that these basic industries of fuel, agriculture, transportand5 I would add;  iron and steel, should have all the workers andequipment they need.1114.   The restoration of our depleted flocks and herds must take time.We can do no more at present than arrange for some rc-distributionof stocks and feedings tuff s.     This is being done.15.   As regards crops, farmers are engaged in a desperate battleagainst time.     With the assistance of the directive authorised bythe Cabinet at their -meeting on 25th March, and now issued by the PrimeMinister (C     (47)115),all possible steps are being taken tc restore theflooded areas as soon as conditions allow, with a view to the maximum practicable acreage being made available for spring sowing..     Labourand mechanical appliances are on the spot and the &quot;technical problemsof cultivation are receiving the urgent attention of an expert committee set up under the auspices of the Emergency AdvisoryOoramittee which I established last week.16.    But the real problem is nation-wide, and unless we can organise the maximum concentration of men and machines on the land in thenext few weeks, and ensure that the seeds and fertilisers tire on the spot when required, precious food will be lost.      Neither can werelax when the spring sowings are completed.17.    I submit that the following steps are necessary:-(a) Transport:    The highest possible transport priorityduring the next few weeks for fodder, seed potatoes,other seeds&apos;, and f^rtiliours ,(b) Rations for agricultural workers:    Agricultural workerswill be required! to work long and strenuous hours.An improvement in their rations (as has been grantedto the miners) is fully justified and would pay ahandsome dividend.      I have asked the Minister of food to give favourable consideration to the con-cession of another shiHingsworth of meat to agricultural workers as part of the ration.( c)    Incentives for -prisoners of war :   Agricu.11ure dependsheavily at the present time on prisoner of war labourand all possible steps should be taken to encourage a full output of work.      In spite of the improvementsintroduced during 1946, a prisoner can earn at most6s.Od. for a 48 hour week, which ho can spend in thecanteen (but not elsewhere), and 9c.Od.  (if he getsthe full &quot;good work&quot; bonus) as a credit which cannotbe spent in this country but is convertible later atlb marks to the  .      This is not enough to encouragehard v/ork.     More spending money is needed, related to work output, and somewhat more latitude in spendingit;    and this would fit in with the relaxation of* security restrictions.      The whole matter requiresimmediate sympathetic review.     A substantial improve-ment would help not only to increase the value ofprisoner labour, but also to meet the criticism both at home and abroad that prisoners are being kept hereunder conditions of forced labour.
(&amp;)    Machinery:    This in rny view is a matter of the utmost importance.      In view of the present critical situation I have, with the agreement of the,Presidentof the Board of Trade , arranged with the leadingmanufacturers of agricultural machinery in shortestsupply to give the greatest assistance to the home market by diversion from export up to  the end ofApril.-     But the needs of agriculture are not confined to the next few weeks.     My colleagues are well aware that the labour force on the land, desperately shortas it is at present, will almost certainly declinestill further as the prisoners are repatriated.        .Unless wo can ensure that farmers get the machinesthey need there will be a serious - and avoidable -loss of the productive capacity of our land.      the factories can produce many more machines.and implements,both for home use and for export, if they can get theirraw materials and components.      I am well aware of thedifficulties of extending over-riding priorities;but I urge most strongly that the battle for food is every bit as vital as the battle for fuel and I ask the Cabinet for a directive for agricultural machineryas comprehensive as that already given for fuel and power, which was in the following terms:-,/?JHCISSIOrT&quot; . . . . the highest priority,  in the supply ofmaterials and labour, to plant for publicelectricity supply, mining equipment, coal/oilconversion, gas undertakings and transport.&quot;(P.0,(47)  12th meeting.; conclusion ask for the approval of my colleagues to(a) the proposed scheme set out in paragraphs 8-12 for compensating farmers for losses of crops and stock;(b) the measures proposed in paragraph 17 for stimulating the food production drive.T.
