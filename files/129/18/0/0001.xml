K   J(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO,C.P.(47)  10121ST MARCH,   1947CABINETFINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE on procedure IN MATRIMONIAL CAUSESMemorandum &quot;by the Lord chancellor the Final Report of the Committee on Procedure inMatrimonial Causes  (the Denning Committee) was published inFebruary,  1947.      Part I of the Report  (Cmd.   7024) containscertain recommendations with regard to the-setting up ofmachinery for the purpose of effecting reconciliation.Very briefly those recommendations are as follows;-(1)    The setting up of a Marriage Welfare service to afford help and guidance both in preparation for marriage and also  in any difficulties arising after marriage.(2)    The making of grant-aids to voluntary organisations working in the field of marriage guidance.(3)    The appointment of Court Welfare Officers togive guidance to parties and to endeavourto effect reconciliation.2. Lord Reading has set down the following motion for Thursday,  27th March:-&quot;To call attention to those recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Committeeon Procedure in Matrimonial Causes  (Cmd.   7024)which are concerned with machinery to be madeavailable for attempting reconciliation betweenthe parties,  and to ask His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwhat action they propose to take in regard tothemj    and to move for Papers.&quot;3. Lord Reading is being supported by the archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Merrirnan,  President of the Probate,Divorce and Admiralty Division, who had himself proposed a detailed scheme designed to effect reconciliation, but which the Denning Committee,   after careful consideration,rejected,4. The Denning Committee express the view that most,if not all,  of the substantive recommendations which they make on the question of reconciliation can be  implementedwithout legislation, but it is exceedingly doubtful whether their views in this respect are well-founded.      Thus, it  is
questionable whether it would he possible to make grant-aidsto voluntary organisations or to appoint Court welfare officers, and to confer on them the powers suggested (e.g.to inspect petitions for divorce lodged with the Court),w ithout legisI at ive au thor ity.5. The Home Secretary and I are in sympathy with theobject of the Committee&apos;s recommendations with regard toreconciliation machinery,  and are in general agreement withthe proposals made.      We recommend that I should reply toLord Reading in guarded but favourable terms,  and pointing out that there are grave doubts whether the DenningCommittee are right in thinking that their recommendationscan be put into force without legislation.6. I ask for the approval of my colleagues of thecourse which I propose.House of Lords,  S.W.I.21st March,  1947.
