Appendix A sets out the facts of the procedurefollowing the Gold Coast murder,3o I have consulted the Lord Chancellor and I appenda statement of the legal position by him (Appendix B)**   Hehas agreed to consider the desirability Of introducing rulesrestricting the time within which petitions must be lodged withthe Judicial Committee;    and altering the law so as to limit to one the number of petitions which may be lodged in any one 3 S  5 eho Meanwhile,  the Lord Chancellor has approved theadoption of an administrative rule, that lodging of a petition with the Privy Council is to be disregarded if theGovernor is satisfied that the petition is intended only forthe purpose of causing delay,  and that the questions raisedeither  (a)  have already been decided by the Judicial Committee,or (b)  are clearly and completely -without substance.      if thelaw is altered so as to limit the number of petitions,  such an administrative rule would have a correspondingly restrictedapplication,  and would be limited to first petitions.5&quot; I am advised that,  although the prerogative ofpardon is delegated to the Governor in Colonial cases,  there remains a residual power of pardon  in His Majesty,   upon theexercise of which it would be my duty to advise His Majesty^I do not propose any alteration in the law, but I would continue to follow the practice always adopted by raypredecessors,  namely to accept the Governor-&apos;s decision onsuch a matter.      Any other course would impose on theSecretary of State a responsibility which the Colonial office is incapable of discharging and would &quot;cross the wires&quot; inthe exercise of the prerogative of mercy which had been expressly laid on the Governor.H To be circulated later,
I therefore recomrae.cabinet as follows:-My advisers should discuss with the Lord Chancellor&apos;department and others interested,  the desirabilityof making rules and altering the low as indicatedin paragraph 3-The adoption of the administrative rule stated inparagraph L.It is undesirable to abolish the residualprerogative remaining in The King in Colonialcases.Since I understand it is the long established practice of the Home Secretary not to givedetails of any advice he has tendered, to HisMajesty regarding the exercise of the prerogativeof mercy,  even after the carrying out or commutationof&apos; the sentences,  the Secretary of State for theColonies should follow the same rule,  and shouldnot give details of any advice he has tendered toHis Majesty,  or of the reasons upon which a governor has acted in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy delegated to him by The King.This rule is based on the sound principle that theHouse of Commons cannot appropriate^ review thefacts of a particular criminal case.      This mustbe left to the courts and to The King or theGovernor and his advisers in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy.I should make a statement to the House on the lines indicated in Appendix 0.xA.C.-J.Colonial Office,  S.W.1.31st March,  1917.h To be circulated later.(a)(b)(c)(d)

The application was dismissed
during the morning,  and the Governor proceeded With theexecutions in the afternoon.      when the third man had &quot;beenexecuted,  the Governor&apos; apparently received a telegram fromthe prisoners&apos;   lawyers here,  informing him that they wouldpetition the Privy Council for leave to appeal from refusal of habeas corpus,  and accordingly the Governor stayed theexecutions of the remaining two men.  .   On the 28th March,he announced the commutation of the sentences on these two,on the ground, that,  knowing three had. been executed, they expected to be executed themselves,  and. had. thus sufferedmental agony which they had not experienced, on the previous occasions j    and on this ground, alone the Governor decidedto commute.      He took this decision against the advice ofhis Executive Council, which was in favour of hanging allthe men.
i it?J. 0 IfAPPENDIX BLEGAL POSITION RELATING TO&apos;APPEALS TO the privy COUNCILNote by the Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for the Colonies has asked me for a statement as to the legal position relating toappeals to the Privy Council.Appeals may be either by right of grant,  that is tosay,  pursuant to some statute conferring a right of appeal,or by special leave which has to be obtained from the privy council itself.In criminal cases there is no appeal by right of grant from the Colonial Courts:    but any person who thinkshimself aggrieved may petition The King for leave to appealand such applications are referred to the Judicial Committeeof the Privy Council.      The Judicial Committee is not a Courtof Criminal Appeal:    it does not grant leave to appeal except where it appears from the petition that some clear departure from the requirements of justice has taken place or that thereis ground for supposing that substantial and grave injustice hasbeen done by a disregard of the form of legal  process or a violation of the principles of natural justice.As a matter of strict law there is no reason whysentence of death pursuant to the judgment of a ColonialCourt should not be carried out notwithstanding the factthat an application for leave to appeal to the Privy council has been lodged,  and it is a completely erroneous view tothink that the Executive is under any legal obligation to postpone the sentence pending the determination of theapplication for leave to appeal.There was a striking illustration of this furnishedin the case of Balmukand v. King-Emperor (1915 A. C.   p.  629).Pour persons had been sentenced to death and the sentencewas due to be carried out shortly after the 3rd March,  1915*Counsel appeared before the Judicial Committee on the latterdate stating that they were not ready to proceed with their application for leave to appeal by reason of the fact that thetranscripts of the judgment had not been received in thiscountry.Accordingly they asked the Board to make an Order or at least a recommendation to the Government of India to postpone the carrying out of the sentences pending the hearing of theapplication for leave to appeal.      The Board declined to makeany such Order or recommendation.      Lord Haldane stated:-;,...,..this Board is not a Court of Criminal Appeal.      Thetendering of advice to His Majesty as to the exercise of hisPrerogative of pardon is a matter for the Executive Governmentand is outside their Lordships&apos;   province.      It is,  of course,open to the Petitioners&apos;   advisers to notify the Government ofIndia that an appeal to this Board, is pending.-     The Governmentof India will no doubt give due weight to the fact and considerthe circumstances.      But their Lordships do not think it rightto express any opinion as to whether the.sentence ought to besuspended11.
It will therefore be seen that the  question whethersentence of death should be carried out. whilst an applicationfor leave to appeal is pending is entirely a matter ofadministration and not of law.There is nothing to prevent a subject&apos;of The Kingfrom applying for special leave to appeal as often as helikes  and if any alteration were to be made in this regardan Act of Parliament would be required since this is aninterference with the Prerogative right.On the other hand. Rules regulating matters ofprocedure and the time within which appeals can be broughtcan be made either under the Judicial Committee Acts or bythe local Governments concerned.      The Judicial Committee havea rule in general terms as follows:-&quot;A Petition for special leave to appeal may belodged at any time after the date of the judgmentsought to be appealed from,  but the petitionershall,   in every case,   lodge his Petition withthe least possible delay.&quot;   ;There are also local Rules dealing with India andthe various Colonies.If, however,  the principle of administration were tobe acted upon that there should be no further delay incarrying out the sentence after the first application forleave to appeal has been refused I do not think that any amendment of the law or the rules  is necessary.J.House of Lords,  S.W.M:.31st March,  19U/.
DRAFT OF STATEMENT TO BE MADE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS3Y THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies the Housei will wish me to make a statement regardingprocedure  in Colonial capital cases because of the exceptionalcourse which the G-old Coast murder case hss taken and thepublic concern that has been shown in it.First,  I am advised that it would be legallypossible for men condemned to death in this country to takethe various proeeediags which have been taken in the gold coast in this case,  except of course the proceedings beforethe Privy Council.      But It  is to be presumed that practitionerin the Courts of this country would not lend themselves tothe bringing of a series of fanciful, applications  to theCourts in which there is no substance.      The delays incarriving out the sentences in this case were not due to anydefect in the Gold Coast criminal law or procedure whichdoes not exist in the law of this country.      Moreover anumber of the steps taken by or on behalf of the condemnedmen were not taken until the last possible moment.      Forexample,  notice of application for a writ of habeas corpuswas not given until eleven minutes before the time fixed for the executions on March 24th,  although it is known thatthe advisers of the accused had this step in mind months before.      Although I hope such an abase of the process of thelaw as has occurred in this case will not be repeated,  itis nevertheless clearly desirable to consider what can bedone to make this impossible  in future.      The right topetition the Judicial Committee for special leave to appeal from the decision of a Colonial Court must be preserved,but the right must not be used by persons sentenced to seek
by repeated delaying tactics to avoid, the execution of the sentences passed -upon them.The Government is considering the desirabilityaof a rule to restrict the time within which petitions mustbe lodged with the Judicial Committee,  and the desirabilityof altering the law so as to limit to one the number ofpetitions lodged in any one case.      Meanwhile an administrativerule is being adopted, to the effect that the lodging of a petition with the Privy Council will be disregarded if theGovernor is satisfied that a petition is intended only forthe purpose of causing delay,  and that the questions raisedeither (a) have already been decided by the Judicial Committee,or (b)  are clearly and&quot;completely without substance.       Ifthe law is altered so as to limit the number of petitions,such an administrative rule will have a correspondinglyrestricted application and will be applicable to firstpetitions only.
