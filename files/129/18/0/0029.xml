DOOUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY QP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)E TTV.Ic.P.(U7)12920TI1 APRIL.   19h7COPY NO.mCABINETREVISION OP THE ANGLO-SOVIET treaty memorandum by the Prime MinisterAt their meeting on 18th March the Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary to negotiate with the Soviet government Treaty going as far as but no farther than the Anglo-FrenchTreaty while giving him full latitude  to moke such variationsas he might third-; necessary (C. M. (kl) 29th Conclusions).    TheCabinet further decided that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposalsfor extending the military clauses of the draft Treatycommunicated to the Soviet Government on 3rd April should bereferred to thorn for further consideration, together with theviews of the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff.2,       At the Interview which the Foreign secretary had withGeneralissimo Stalin on 2kth March it was agreed by both parties that negotiations for the revision, of the 19h2 treaty should start at once.    At the second meeting of British and soviet Delegates on 3rd April draft texts were exchanged andsubsequently discussed at a third meeting on 10th April.3.       Annex A below contains  the British draft text.Annex B contains the Soviet draft text.Annex 0 contains the telegraphic record of the thirdmeeting (Moscow telegram lib. 719) where these were discussed.k*       In order to meet the points raised by M. Vyshinsky atthe third meeting the Foreign Secretary proposed to communicate to the Russians a revised version of the British draft undercover of a Note explaining that this was the most which HisMajesty&apos;s Government were prepared to offer.    As the cabinet was informed on 17th April the Foreign secretary,  in thisrevised version,  considered adding to Article II a paragraph.n the following terms&quot;In the ease of an armed attack this support and assistance will be afforded also against any otherpower which may join with Germany in such an attack in Europe&quot;.3.       Both the Foreign. Office and the Chiefs of Staffentertained serious doubts about the addition of this clause.The view of the Foreign Office is set out in paragraph 6 OfForeign Office telegram No, 1369 to Moscow, which is attachedat Annex D.    The view of the Chiefs of Staff was that they considered that from the military point of view the suggestedextension of the Treaty was undesirable.    If, however, suchan extension were considered politically essential then they suggested that the additional clause should be redrafted torender it less danp;erous.
6.       The Foreign Secretary has now decided not to add anadditional paragraph to Article II of the draft Tout only tooffer the Russians a text containing certain minor amendments,which are set forth in Moscow telegram No,   964 (Annex E), and&apos;indicated in the text at Annex A.    These amendments fall within the authority already given &quot;by the Cabinet (CM. (47)29th conclusions) and are unobjectionable.    The foreign secretary has therefore been authorized to proceed on this basis,.C. R.10, Downing Street,20TH APRIL,   1947-2-

Owing to illnessSir 0.  Harvey and&apos;Mr.   Golunski were replaced respectively byMr.  Dean and Mr.   Novikoff (Head of the European Department).2.      Mr. Vyshinski asked Sip M. Peterson to comment on theSoviet draft and Sir M.  Peterson spoke in the sense of first three paragraphs of my tele; ram No; G7h.    In addition he drew attention to the absence of any reference to the respective,treaties with France and to the vagueness of paragraph 6 ofthe preamble which contrasted with the clear reference to thexitlantic Charter in the British draft.    He stressed our determination that no friendship of ours should be exclusiveand suggested negotiations should be kept on the basis of a
treaty directed against Germany.    Who were the &quot;other States&quot;referred to in the Soviet draft?    Were they Bulgaria, Roumania,etc?    It might be so but he doubted it.3.     vyshinski countered this by a reference to Stalin&apos;slanguage in his first message to me (penultimate paragraphof Foreign Office telegram No: 341  to Moscow of 23rd January).Soviet aim was to remove all reservations which weaken thetreaty.    While continuing to emphasise importance Russiansattach to their revised Article 6 he claimed that there wasno ground for the suggestion that the words &quot;any other State&quot;in the preamble and in articles 1   and 3 of the Soviet draftwidened the scope of the treaty and increased the commitment which it involved.    These words were taken from the existingtreaty which had fifteen years to run.    Under that treatyGreat Britain would have been obliged to go to war with, e. g.Spain, Portugal or Turkey if any one of these countries had joined Germany in her attack on the Soviet Union.    If there were,no new treaty this obligation would remain for the duration of the present treaty.    Why then boggle at restating a commitment which already existed?U.      Sir M.  Peterson replied that there was the essential difference that the  &quot;other States,: aimed at in the 19U2 treatywere clearly indicated.    Great Britain was in fact actuallyat war with them, in any treaty which might be concluded nowthere would be no such clarity as to who was meant.5.      On a point of interpretation Mr.   Dean and he thoughtVyshinski was wrong about Spain.     If Spain had declared war on the U.S.3.R.  in say 19hh, treaty would not have obligedBritain to go to war with Spain.    She probably would have&apos; done so but there would have been no obligation.    x).rticle I of present treaty referred to &quot;States which are associated with&quot;Germany.6.     Vyshinski said he would substitute Italy for Spain.    he admitted that paragraph 8 of Soviet preamble referred tafuture a. progression.7.      He went on to make following points:-(l)    Soviet had no objection to including a reference tothe respective treaties with France.(2)    articles, t and 2 of the Soviet draft contained no reference to the Four Power Treaty because Sovietwere anxious to keep their treaty with us on a bilateral basis.    Quadripartite provisions wouldcomplicate matters and cause delays.    Moreoverthere was, no Four-Power Treaty as yet in existence.(3)    He noticed that the British draft did not include the.:last clause of Article V (2) of the Anglo-Frenchtreaty relating to obligations inconsistent withthe treaty.    Why was this?
ft i aMl *$- JJ,,Reverting to article VI of the Soviet draft he was,now able to say that the wording -proposed wouldbe regarded on the Soviet side as entailing the suppression of any propaganda systematically-   hostile, to Britain and vice versa.8. Vyshinski gave the impression of having obtained specialauthorisation to make this last statement.9.     Sir M.  Peterson replied to (2) above that while Vyshinskiwas unwilling to refer in the Soviet draft to a hypotheticalFour-Power Treaty he was very ready to refer to hypotheticalacts or even threats of -aggression by hypothetical associatesof Germany.    This was one  of our main difficulties.10.     In regard to point (3)  nnu if Soviet attached importanceto this clause it might be possible to meet them.11.    No particular enthusiasm was shown on the British sideover point (h).12.    Vyshinski objected to specific reference In preamble ofBritish draft to certain Articles of Charter of the united nations and not to others such as 1+5* WJ and 5h.    MoreoverCharter itself might be modified.    The Atlantic Charter was covered by the &quot;agreements&quot; mentioned in the Soviet preamble.As a general observation he emphasised that Soviet wished -toget away from &quot;interpretations&quot; and get on to &quot;spirit&quot;.    their aim was to bind our two countries by a close alliance whichwould rule out third party mischief -making.13.    Sir M.  Peterson said they had so far talked almostentirely about the Soviet draft.    Would Vyshinski give themhis appreciation of the British draft?&quot;11+.    Vyshinski said he had already indicated Soviet objectionsto paragraphs 2 and 11 of the ;preamble and to Article I.In article II he would like to delete the specific referenceto article 51  of the Charter of the United&apos; Nations which wassuperfluous once the Charter itself was mentioned in thetreaty.    As to Article VIII the Soviet clung to the revisedwording of their own Article VI.    But if the British -wanted togot in their -phrase about obligations Soviet would have noobjection.15.    Otherwise there was no Soviet objection to the British draft beyond the General objection that it was repetitivewhereas Soviet draft cleared away reservations and putalliance on a new footing.Ip.    It was agreed that our side should notify Vyshinskiwhen they were ready for further discussion.&quot;17.    My comments on present position will follow.
1K 01   faANNEX IDCOPY OF A TEhSGRAM DATED 14-TH hPRIL.   1947,FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSCOW (EMBASSY)No, 1569Following for Secretary of State from Sir o,  Sargent.Your telegrams Nos.  719 and 925.paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 925.    We see noobject1011 to the addition after Article 6 of our draft of anew Article worded as follows ; -&quot;The high contracting parties, recognising that theincrease of mutual intercourse will conduce to thedevelopment of friendship between them, undertaketo facilitate such intercourse by all means in their power, including the improvement and extension ofland, sea and air communications between their twocountries,&quot;In this connexion please see memorandum enclosed in mr, liankey&apos; s letter to Sir M, Peterson of 20th March,2, We should be reluctant to delete the words in paragraph2 of the Preamble referring to Byrnes&apos; Treaty because -(1)    these words appear in the Treaty of Dunkirk, andin fact we made a special point of them with theFrench;    and(2)    contain a statement that the Byrnes&apos;  Treaty isconsidered most desirable, which is something more and different from the mere safeguard forthat Treaty at the beginning of Article I.3.       Paragraph h of the preamble.    Text suggested by you isambiguous in that -(1)    it is not clear if bi-lateral agreements areincluded as well as four-party agreements;    and(2)    it may well refer to the &quot;principles of&quot; all theagreements concluded during the war.We consider that its generality and ambiguity is extremelydangerous.    Reference to &quot;principles&quot; of these agreementsincreases the ambiguity.    We note that your proposal is iniact considerably different from that in Soviet draft whichapart from omission of France,  is limited by the words&apos;(&apos;aur&apos;ing the War&quot;.    Mere omission in your draft of the words&apos; during the war&quot; would not in itself exclude Yalta, Tehranr   . w-ich the Russians clearly had in mind in proposingtneir draft arid over interpretation of which we are oftenuot i:a Agreement with Russians.
ii.       We- would regret the omission from paragraph 1+ of ourpreamble of the words you refer to because -(1)    the references to the particular Articles of the charter were pressed upon the French in negotiating the Treaty of Dunkirk;    and(2)    American advice during Dunkirk negotiations wasthat it was most desirable to show that everyundertaking in the bi-latoral treaty was justified by and consistent with some particularprovision, in the charter (see also paragraph 9below)5,       Article 2.    If reference to particular Articles of the charter is omitted from the Preamble,  it becomes all themore essential to keep them in Article 2, and indeedparagraph 2 of Article 2 should then refer in terms to article 107 of the charter arid paragraph 3 to Article 2+9 ofthe charter.    Additional reasons for inclusion of references to particular Articles of the Charter are that we attach great importance to the scope of our actual obligations herebeing defined by reference to the relevant Article of the charter, i.e.  in the first obligation in paragraph 2 ofArticle 2 the expression &quot;armed attack&quot; must have in theTreaty precisely the same meaning as it has in the Charter.It is also important that our obligations towards russia should be defined, as closely as and in the same terms as our obligations towards France.6.       As regards  the new&quot; paragraphs which you proposed to add to Article 2,  this clearly goes beyond what the cabinet have authorised you to offer to the Soviet Government.    Weshall also have to consult the chiefs of Staff and we are accordingly asking them for their views urgently.    There isthe further awkward point that a provision on these linesgoes beyond what we have concluded, with the French Government.If, however, we are to offer the Russians a clause on thelines you suggest we think it important that it should be specifically limited to the&apos; action of a European State inEurope in association with Germany.    We think It would be advisable to steer clear of any provision which could be interpreted as referring to action by a non-European powerand of any case in which Germany might associate herself inaggressive action already taken by another State.    in thecourse of the next fifty years it seems to us that a clash between United States and Soviet union in Far East,  in which germany might join against Russia,  is at least as likely asa Goman attack on Russia.    It is therefore most important to exclude possibility of Soviet union claiming in such a&apos;case that we were bound by the Treaty to come to her assistance.    The expression &quot;join with Germany&quot; might alsobe interpreted by Russians as applying to other than activemilitary assistance,  i.e.  to propaganda, or diplomaticsupport.    to cover these points we suggest the following alternative wording &quot;in the case of aai armed fit tack byGermany this support and assistance will be afforded inEurope also against any other State which may take part with Germany in such an attack in Europe&quot;.Article,7.    No objection to your suggestion.
8.       We entirely agree with suggestion in paragraph 2 ofyour telegram that it is important at this stage to indicateclearly that draft it is now proposed to give  the Russians isthe test that we can do and that we cannot contemplate anyother extensions  of the Treaty.9.        P,s regards references to United Nations Charter,  itseems to us that if Russians,   as they may do, put outpropaganda line to the effect that you are making difficulties about revision of the Treaty which would have really bound thetwo nations .closer together,  our best reply will be -(a)    that we attach great importance to maximummultilateral action in these matters in thespirit of the charter;    and(b)&apos;   that we offered the Russians provisionssimilar to those we have concluded with theFrench.This seems to us best line; of defence with our own publicopinion.    With this  in view, we think the more references to the charter the hotter and we regard  -soviet desire to-whittle down such references as definitely sinister.10..    With reference to paragraph h of your telegram wewould again emphasise the desirability of not pushing aheadAnglo-Soviet Treaty negotiations too fast while negotiationsfor Byrnes&apos; Draft Treaty have not even started.    If you wereto come away from Moscow with nothing achieved save an anglo-Soviet Treaty, would this not make a very bad impression in the united States?11.     We have not had time to submit the questions at issue-to the Cabinet,  or as regards paragraph 6 above,  to theChiefs of Staff.    I must therefore ask you to consider abovecomments as being made ad referendum.
*5 E *J *lANNEX gCOPY OF A TELEGRAM DATED 1STH APRIL.   1947,FROM MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE9 bU.Y&apos;our telegrams Nos.  1369 and 1405.Anglo-Soviet Treaty.Following, from Secretary of State.I have reached the conclusion that it would not be safe to go beyond the general scope of the Agio-French Alliance.In particular I think it would be too risky to include any provisions covering assistance against &quot;any other state&quot; orbinding us in the case of &quot;actions or measures directly or indirectly directed against the other high contracting party&quot;.-2.       Further I am anxious  to have another round withVyshinski before I leave Moscow.    This means that I mustapproach him very soon:    and I have been considering whatproposal I can made to him without going beyond what theCabinet has already authorised.3.       I have come to the conclusion that the ambassador should write to Vyshinski telling him that we have given further study to the problem and consider that though we can make some verbal modifications to our draft of the 3rd Aprilwe cannot agree to any substantial alterations in it.    Thus -(A.)    In paragraph 2 of the preamble I am prepared to substitute for the words &quot;while consideringmost desirable1&apos; the words &quot;without prejudice to&quot; ;(B) In paragraph 4 of the preamble I am prepared to omit the words &quot;and in particular1 with Articles49, 51, 52, 53 and 107 of the Charter&quot;; but ifthis is accepted(C) Article 2 of the Treaty must contain reference to specific articles of the charter as suggested inparagraph 5 of your telegram No.  1369.    Otherreferences to the Charter will also be retained.(D) Article J;    I am prepared to add the words &quot;norwill they enter into any obligations inconsistent with the provisions of the present Treaty&quot;.4.        The Ambassador&apos; would at the same time put in a plea fora new article on the improvement of communications as inparagraph 1  of your telegram No.  1,3,6:9.5.       Unless you see serious objection I propose that theAmoassador should send Vyshinski a letter on these linestomorrow afternoon 19th April.    It is likely that he will not receive ah answer before I leave Moscow;    but the next moveaill be up to Vyshinski and I am reconciled to the prospectof getting no revised treaty while I am here.    I would leavexurther discussions in the hands of the Ambassador.    I must^ad however that latter sees small hope of securing a treaty on these lines.
