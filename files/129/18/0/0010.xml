ilS DOCUMENT  IS   THE  PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERN MEN!Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1947SECRET Copy No^ QCP. (47) 11026th March, 1947CABINETPOWER STATION AT BANKSIDEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the City of London Electric Lighting Company, Limited, supported bythe Central Electricity Board, have applied to the Electricity Commissioners,and to the London County Council as planning authority, to allow the construc-tion of a 210,000 k.w. electricity generating station in replacement of theexisting 85,000 k.w. station on the South Bank of the Thames, opposite toSt. paul&apos;s, between Biackfriars Bridge and Southwark Bridge. The planningissue has been referred to the Minister of Town and Country Planning.2. This was considered by the Lord Presidents Committee, sitting under my Chairmanship, at their meeting on 14th March (L.P. (47) 9th Meeting). Agreat power station on Bankside would, in the opinion of the Minister of Townand Country Planning, ruin the London Plan for the regeneration of the South Bank, and would seriously impair the view across the river from St. Paul&apos;s,which is to be provided under the City Plan; an alternative site capable of taking a power station of 300,000 k.w. capacity can be made available at Rotherhithefour miles down the river; but the completion of the first section of the newstation (105,000 k.w.) which would be achieved at Bankside by the autumn of1950, would not be achieved at Rotherhithe until at least one winter later or possibly two.3. The general view of the Lord Presidents Committee Ministers beingsomewhat divided was that, if the erection of the station at Rotherhithe wouldinvolve more than six months&apos; delay in the provision of the new generating capacity, the proposal to rebuild the station at Bankside should be approved;and the Minister of Town and Country Planning was invited, after consultationwith the other Departments concerned, to furnish me with a report on theprospects of completing the first stage of a new power station at Rotherhithenot later than six months after the estimated date of completion of the first stage of a new power station at Bankside.4. Consultation has taken place, and the Minister of Town and country planning informs me that there is small prospect of completing the first stage ofa station at Rotherhithe within six months after the estimated date of completinga similar stage at Bankside. Nevertheless, the Minister still feels very strongly that the Bankside project ought not to be approved, and I accordingly submitthis issue to the Cabinet.5. The Minister of Town and Country Planning cannot even give an assurance that the delay, if Rotherhithe is chosen, will not be as much as twowinters. The estimated date for completion of the first section at Bankside isthe autumn of 1950. The time-table at Rotherhithe would, I am informed, runas follows : Compulsory acquisition of the Botherhithe site, which would beundertaken by the London County Council, would take four months from thedate of announcement of the decision. (The site at Bankside is already owned by the Company.) The main trouble at Rotherhithe arises from the fact thata public road crosses the site, with a sewer running underneath it. and that both road and sewer would have to be diverted. The London County Council, whowould carry out the diversion, say that, while the diversion of the road would[33376]
be comparatively simple, the shifting of the sewer would take nine months fromthe-date of gaining possession of the site. That makes thirteen months. TheCentral Electricity Board say that, in addition, the construction of the stationon the Rotherhithe site would take five months longer than the construction ofthe station on the Bankside site, because of sub-soil difficulties.6. If all these periods run consecutively, therefore, the first section atRotherhithe would take eighteen months longer than the first section at Bank-side. That would mean two winters. The Central Electricity Board say thatthe periods would have to run consecutively. The Board would, however, be given possession of the Rotherhithe site in four months&apos; time, except that theroad would still run across it, and it might be possible for them to begin work-on the foundations of the new station before the road and sewer are actuallydiverted; but until they have examined the site and the sab-soil more closelytechnical advisers and authorities are unable to say whether this would be possible.Meanwhile, naturally, the Board take a conservative view.7. Therefore, completion of the first section of the new power station on theRotherhithe site, providing 105,000 k.w. capacity, will certainly take onewinter longer than completion of the same capacity on the Bankside site, andmay probably will take two winters longer. Completion of the whole station at Rotherhithe will not take longer than completion of the whole at Bankside.and when it is completed it will, as explained above, be bigger. It has to be added,however, that, if Bankside is agreed, the Central Electricity Board, and hieElectricity Commissioners, would want Rotherhithe to go ahead as well, and thatthe Minister of Town and Country Planning would feel compelled to agree tothat. If Bankside is not agreed, he undertakes to help the Central electricity board to find the additional sites they need as a matter of urgency.8. The Air Ministry prefer Bankside to Rotherhithe on the ground thatthe latter is a denser industrial concentration; but the Lord Presidents Com-mittee did not feel that this argument was weighty.9. The Minister of Town and Country Planning has reconsidered the Bank-side project since learning that the probability of delay in providing the acldi-tional generating facilities is not one winter but two, but still desires to urge that permission for the new power station on Bankside should be refused. the planning proposal is that the South Bank from County Hall to SouthwarkCathedral should be redeveloped for commercial, residential and public purposes:and the power station would, in his opinion, inevitably industrialise the wholeof the stretch between Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges. The scheme for the redevelopment of the South Bank is designed to bring new life to impoverishedneglected South London, and to reorient the direction of London&apos;s commercial development. To give this up even for two winters&apos; delay in the provision of105,000 k.w. of generating capacity, a very small proportion of the total capacitythat will be available to Greater London by 1950, having regard to the manymajor projects for new stations and extensions of stations which have alreadybeen approved in the London area, would, to his mind, be utterly disproportionate.10. On the other hand, the urgency of increasing generating capacity andof taking quick decisions to this end is imperative, and, in my view, thjs matter has already been debated much too long. I ask my colleagues, therefore, to decideone way or the other now.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,26th March, 1947.
