THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY ON HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C RET C.P. (47)  134 COPY NO.21 ST APRIL,  1947CABINETPROVISION OF AIRCRAFT FOR THE GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONSMeiaorandurn by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs. At their meeting on 17th April (CM. (47) 37thConclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet invited me  to hoxd a meetingof the Civil Aviation Co..tmittee in order to resolve a conflict of view between the   Ministry of Civil aviation and the Ministryof Supply about  the desire of  the former to obtain from theUnited States, for the use of B.O.A.C.,  a further number ofConstellation aircraft to be fitted with British engines.. The matter is of some urgency in view of  the motion on the British civil aircraft position, Which is to be debated in the House of Commons on 24th -April.2. The Minister of Civil Aviation and the Minister ofSupply provided the Committee with a memorandum (C.A.C. (47) 9 )&quot;rcontaining an agreed statement of the facts bearing on theproposal to purchase these American aircraft.      It will be seenthat both Ministers agree that the Government Corporation should always be required to use British aircraft,  save in the most exceptional circumstances,  but  that they disagree as to thestrength of the case in favour of the proposal for the purcla.seof nine Lockheed Constellation II aircraft for operation on theEmpire services ana on the North Atlantic route from the autumn of 1947 onwards.      This memorandum,  therefore, deals with theposition on these routes in relation to the proposed purchase.3. Project X,  the name by which zhe proposal to purchaseConstellation aircraft and re-engine them with British Centaurusengines has become known, derives in part from the allegedfailure of the Tudor I to come dp to anticipations and in part to ueficiencies in grouna organisation on the Empire routes ohwnieh h was originally intended that the Tudor I should beused,  in addition to the North Atlantic route.It is contended by the Minister of Supply that the tudor I is not in fact a-failure, and that its performance hasbeen very adversely affected by addition...1 requirements placedon the constructors by the operating Corporations;    but theMinister of Civil -aviation states that even if these difficultiescould be overcome and the range of the aircraft (the main difficulty so far as the North Atlantic route is concerned)could be increased by fuelling in the air,  the aircraft wouldstiPi be uneconomical as compared with the Constellation.Annex
ij.. In the view of the Committee, whatever may ultimately bo decided about Project X, it is of the greatest importance that every effort  should be made to&quot; effect further improvements in the Tudor I even if they involve some diminution of the stanearus of internal fitment now demanded by the operators.     An example of the increase of weight resultingfrom these demands is the fitting of bunks instead of seats,a feature, incidentally, which is not provided on UnitedStates tircraft on the North Atlantic houte.5. The Committee felt  that project X,  if adopted,   would very greatly damage the prestige of the British aircraft industry, because it would mean.in effect that B.0.A.C.,  ourlargest Corporation, would be operating its main servic e s w i tnAmerican aircraft and the export of British aircraft couldnot fail to bo very seriously affected.6. The reason for our relative backwardness in theproduction of civil aircraft is that British aircraft  indusrty was required during the war to concentrate on military types and&apos; has not yet had time; to prouuce new types of civil aircraft.The American aircraft industry was not placed in this positionduring the war and has a considerable head start on us.      these facts are well known throughout the world and the Committee feelthat we  should not attempt  to obscure  oho reasons for ourpresent disadvantageous position by purchasing foreign machines,but should rather face the facts frankly and put every effortpossible behind the new types.7. It is also our view that, given sufficient effort,B.O.A.G.  should be able to achieve considerable savings both inthe cost and in the standards of their services, thus reducingthe; deficit resulting from the use of British aircraft.8. The Committee saw no re a. son to doubt that the brabazon I and other new types of British  civil aircraft whichare due to come into operation,  say,  in 1952, will not fullyestablish British prestige, ana on balance they feel that notwithstanding the  disadvcu tages they may uisplay in comparisonwith the newest American types we should depend upon Britishinterim types until these new types are available.It must be recognised, however,  that, as the ginis torof Civil Aviation has pointed out,  if Project X is sbandoncuthere will be no adequate insurance against delays or failuresof the Brabazon I and the other new types which are in come degree experimenta1.9. As regards the financial effect of relying on the interim types,  the Minister of Civil Aviation has pointed outthat the present estimated loss per annum by the three BritishCorporations covering,  inter alia,  the North Atlantic and theEmpire routes to South Africa ana Australia, greatly exceeds the present statutory limit of  10,000,000 per annum and. thaiwithout the new Constellation machines there is no reliableprospect of reducing the deficit below the statutory limit.The Committee felt, however,  that even if we proceeded withProject X the net  saving&quot;would only be a small proportion ofthe total annual deficit for the three Corporations, and that
any saving achieved would be more than outweighed by the adverse effect on the prestige of the British aircraft industry and its enueavours to build up exports.10. -Accordingly,  it was the majority view of theCommittee that in the interests of the British aircraft industry it would be inadvisable to accede to B.O.A.C.&apos;request that they should be allowed to purchase furtherConstellations whether or not they are equipped with Britishengines, that we should rely on interim British types untilthe Brabaaon I and other new types come into operation,  andthat all efforts should be concentrated on the improvement ofthese interim types, ana the production of the new types at as early a date as possible. -We must point out, however,  that the minister ofCivil Aviation felt himself unable to concur in therecommendation not to proceed with Project X.Dominions Office, S.W.  1.,21st April,. 19b7.
9,7 ^MBEXCABINETCIVIL AVIATION COMMITTEEPROJECT XtNote by. the Ministers of Supply and of Civil AviationSmu&amp;ary1 .^    A decision is required as to whether BOAC should beauthorised to purchase nine Lockheed Constellation II aircraft for operation on the Empire services and across the north atlantic from the autumn of 19a.7 onwards,  and for subsequent;-re-englning with British Centaurus engines.      This is knownas Project X.2.     We both agree that the air line Corporations should always be required to use British aircraft save in themost exceptional circumstances.      We disagree,  however,  asto the strength of the case In favour of Project X and whetherthe situation with which it is designed to deal can properly be regarded as so exceptional as to justify a further departure from the principle that the Corporations should not use aircraftairframes or aero-engines designed or manufactured outsideHi s Ma j e st y &apos; s d ami ni o ns.3.      The matter is therefore submitted to the Committeefor decision as to what recommendation should be made to theCabinet.      It is clear that  the decision must turn on thefollowing main considerations(a)  whether the British types at present used  (Lancastrianand York land planes and Hytrie  flying boafl)  andthe Improved British types (the Tudors and Hermesland planes and the Solent flying boat)  whenavailable are adequate for the main Empire routespending the Introduction of the advanced new british types now under development  (theDe Haviiland 106 and the Saunders Roe Saro U5flying boat).(h)   Tile strength of the financial oase for Project Xand the &quot;prospect of recovering the dollar expenditure involved.      These in turn depend to a largeextent upon the length of the period assumed beforethe new British types planned for operation on theEmpire and Atlantic rentes,  namely the D.H.  106,the Brabazon I and the Saunders Roe flying boatare likely to be available for service. Ministry ofSupply consider that these typos will: be ready by theend of 1951 but MRCA think it unlikely that they-will come iriuo operation before the end of 19.52,,Proje&amp;t X would,  therefore, represent an insurance against the risk of a setback in theappearance of the new British types*

STATEMENT AGREED BETWEEN MINISTRY 0? CIVIL aviation and MINISTRY OP SUPPLY1.       present plans for the operation by BOAC of the mainpmpire routes to Australia and South Africa envisage the useof three interim British types-    the Tudor II,  the Solentflying boat and (from 1949)  the Hermes IV.    These types wouldhave to remain in operation until 1951 when (if all goes well)re-equipment with the D.H.106 (Brabason IV) and the SaundersRoe Saro 45 flying boat should begin.2.       in the report of the Self Committee circulated to theCabinet on 2nd August,&apos;1946, it was fully recognised thatcompetition from American aircraft on the Empire trunk routes between 1948 and 1950 would be serious and the report statedthat the BOAC position might well become commerciallydesperate if the Commonwealth Governments went to UnitedStates types.    This they have in fact done,   in spite ofstrenuous efforts to maintain the principle of paralleloperation of services with Tudor II aircraft.    The Australianshave purchased Constellations  in preference to Tudor II andthe South Africans are using Skymasters.    it was formerlyhoped that a medium stage service with Tudor II might be ableto hold its own but the range, pay-load and take-off of the tudor II are likely to fall somewhat below previousexpectations and the fact that there is a lack of suitableair-fields in South Africa end beyond Calcutta, has made  itnecessary to plan long stage operations for which the Tudor IIwas not designed.    The Solent will also be at a -disadvantageas regards speed.    The competitive position of BOAC will be only slightly improved with the appearance of the Hermes IVin 1949.    Consequently BOAC estimate that the operation ofthe Empire routes with these interim types will result in a deficit to be met by subsidy of over 2 million pounds a year.This is a very serious position, particularly in view of thestatutory limit of subsidy payable to the publicly ownedCorporations.    if we cannot achieve more economical results,it will be necessary to restrict the expansion of servicesconsiderably unless legislation is introduced to increase thesubsidy limit.5.       The; most formidable competition to be faced on theEmpire routes undoubtedly comes from the LockheedConstellation II and it is clear from a survey of the Americanscene that this aircraft is likely to remain pre-eminent inits class, at least until 1951.4.       Furthermore,  technical discussions between the LockheedCompany end the Bristol Aeroplane Company have demonstrated&apos;thatif the Constellation were re-engined with a British engine -the Bristol Centaurus - a still better aeroplane would resulthaving advantages in speed, range, take-off and economy of operation over the existing aircraft.    This American/Britishcombination would be likely to hold its own against allcompetition on the Empire routes at least until 1951  andprobably longer.9.       The proposal has,   therefore, been put forward that nineConstellation aircraft which have been returned to Lockheedsthrough the cancellation of a contract by an American airlineshould be purchased from Lockheeds and be put into operation by 30AC as soon as possible,  i.e. before the end of 1947 andthat development work on the Centaurus installation shouldbe put in hand with a view to re-erigining the nine aircraftone by one as soon as practicable.
fed si6,       The North Atlantic route is also involved,,    Existingplans for the operation of this route are  based upon thecontinued use of BQAC&apos;s present fleet of five Constellation I aircraft supplemented in the autumn of 1948 &quot;by the six BoeingStfatocrulsers on order,    16 Tudor I aircraft are also on order with a view to use on the service London/Montreal,These types would continue in use at least until 1951 when,in the Ministry of Supply view,  (if all goes well)  the bristol 167 (Brabazon I) and sauiiders Hoe Saro 45 flyingboat should become available.    The situation is much morefavourable; than on the Empire routes since BOAC should beable to maintain a fully competitive service with theAmerican types, but some doubt has arisen whether the Tudor i will prove suitable for the forth Atlantic operation and itmay have to be used elsewhere instead e.g.  on the south atlantic by BSAA.    This would leave a gap on the north atlantic and it is,-moreover, evident,  in view of thepopularity of BOAChs present service on this route,  that agood deal more revenue could be earned if the total pay-loadcapacity available were increased.    It is therefore proposedthat if the nine Constellation II aircraft are purchased,five of them should be put Into operation to begin with onthe North Atlantic in the place of the existing fiveConstellation I&apos;;s which would be transferred to service onthe Australian route.    The advantage.of this exchange isthat the Constellation II would provide a considerably increased pay-load on the North Atlantic and bring in dollarrevenue to be sot off against the cost of purchasing theaircraft.    The Constellation i&apos;s would be quite suitable onthe Australian route even though in competition withConstellation II&apos;s operated by Qantas Empire Airways andothers.    Moreover, these five aircraft would themselveseventually be re-engiried with a later version of theCentaurus engine and could then be put bach (probably not before the summer of 1950) on the North Atlantic,  thusreleasing Constellation II&apos;s for return to the Empire routes,7.        The sequence of operations proposed would therefore beas follows(a) purchase nine Constellation II aircraft with american aright engines and put five of them into service  on the North Atlantic and threeon the Empire routes.    The ninth ConstellationII would be retained by Lockheeds for development work on the Centaurus installation.(b) Tropicalise the five Constellation I aircraftwithdrawn from the North Atlantic and put them into operation on the Australian route,(c) When the Gentaurus Installation in ConstellationII  is proved withdraw the three Constellation IIaircraft on the Empire routes and the fiveConstellation aircraft on the North atlantic route one at a. time for re-englning,    it isestimated that this process would be completed by August,  1949.(d) The five Constellation I aircraft would similarly be  withdrawn one at a time for the installation of the later Gentaurus engine, and this work would, probably be completed by the summer of1950.-h-
6 8 X8&quot;        Financial Balance Sheet.    In order to give someappraisement of the financial effects,  it is necessary todecide what assumption should be made as to the probable lengthof service of the Constellation fleet.    This in tuna depends upon when the new British types will be ready to go into service, which cannot be definitely predicted at the presenttime.    Ministry of Supply consider that the D.H.  106,  the bristol 167 and the Saro 1+5 should all. be ready to beginservice before the end of 1951  though in the case of theD.H.   106 it would, perhaps, be unwise  to assume that BO ACwould have taken delivery by then of all eight aircraft theyhave ordered.    Ministry of Civil Aviation, however, considerthat 1951  is optimistic and that these types are unlikely tobe ready for regular passenger service before the end of 1952.(Assuming there are no unfortunate set-backs in the developments in this new&quot; sphere).    The balance sheet which follows has been drawn up on the assumption that theConstellation fleet would, be operated for four years (i. e.autumn of 1 9U7 to autumn of 1951) but it will be evident thatfor every year that re-equipment with new British types isdelayed the balance sheet will become more favourable toproject X.A.

It should be emphasised that the above analysis offinancial- effects of Project X can only be a roughapproximation.    It assumes that all British aircraft at present on order would&quot;still be used productively if Project X were approved.    It omits certain factors which cannot be estimated,e.g,  the return if any on the development expenditure  onCentaurus engines,  etc.  resulting from any subsequentcommercial sales.    It omits an indirect dollar credit whichwould result from the eventual closing down of the existingConstellation  repair base at Dorval because it is not clear to what extent the transfer of this base to the unitedKingdom depends upon project X.    It must also be observedthat a good deal of argument is possible as to the make-up of30/iC&apos; a estimates of subsidy saving and additional dollarrevenue and no-one can be  sure that in practice the savingsand dollar earnings arising from the operation of Project Xwould be as great as shown.10.      Furthermore,   the division into dollars and sterlingdoes not necessarily convey a true picture in terms of currency.    For example, hard currencies may be earned bycarrying passengers who would be-attracted to BOAC&apos;s services with Constellations, but might otherwise travel, for example,by the Dutch airline K.L.M.:    this factor is concealed inthe sterling side of the account.    On the other hand it is assumed that all the Wright engines would be sold second ahand and for dollars.
Q 55.0 i&amp;11.      consideration of the probable effect of the project on balance of trade opens up some very difficult issues which areimpossible to evaluate precisely.    On the one hand the successof the Centaurus installation would probably lead to valuableorders being placed with the Bristol Company by Lockheeds forengines to be installed in new Constellation aircraft and byOverseas Operators who might also be attracted by the American/British combination.    While there is nothing to stop Lockheedsend Bristols proceeding with the development work on their own initiative,   they are more likely to do so if given the  initialinducement which Project X offers.    On the other hand,  this new combination would not become available until late in the life of the Constellation and when operators may be turningfrom piston engines such as the Centaurus to gas turbines. %Moreover,  the prestige of the British aircraft industry as awhole would be bound to suffer gravely from the decision to operate the main Empire routes with American aircraft (evenif later to be powered with British engines);    this wouldparticularly tend to discredit the British interim typesthemselves, but the repercussions would be felt throughout theindustry and earnings from exports (including sales to hard currency areas) would be affected.    Moreover,  the discouragementto British designers and the lessened inducement to BOAC toco-operate in getting the new British aircraft into servicequickly might result in delays which would be avoided if the manufacturers and the Corporations were kept &quot;on their toes&quot;to end the period of reliance on interim types as quickly aspossible.12,      On the other hand there  is   the serious danger that the prestige and efficiency of our operators will suffer gravelyif they have for long to compete on the Empire routes withplanes which are slower and less economic than the constellationsflown by our American, Butch, French, and Australian competitors.
