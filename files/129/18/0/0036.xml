26th April,.1947 G A B j M ^ tIM&apos;EM\TATICN.JL ALLOCATION OF TliviBERMemorandum by the Pr&amp;sident of the Board of trade.     Since the conclusion of hostilities^ the purchases of sawn softwoodtimber by European Countries members of the Emergency Economic Committee for europe have been subject to co-ordination and a loose form of allocationby the Timber Sub-Committee of E.E.CE.  on v/hich most of the producgin^.countries other than the TJ. S. S.R.  are represented.      Our object on theCommittee has been, to assist the procurement and an equitable distributionof timber by exchanging information as to requirements and supplies with both buying and producing countries;     but to avoid measures which wouldhamper purchasing or reduce    the total quantities which cuuld be got out.2.     In 1946,  the Sub-Ooinmittee estimated the total availabilities forexport to E.E.C.E. countries at 1,391,000 standards, and agreed upon themaximum total quantities to be bought by each country.      The United Kingdomallocation was 332,000 standards against which we actually secured forarrival in 1946 810,000 standards.       This was a larger proportion of allocation than was achieved by any other country, with the exception of denmark.3*      Eor 1947, a preliminary estimate of availabilities of 1,913,000standards was agreed at a meeting of the Timber Sub-Committee in London on 5th February;     and on the bs.sis of these availabilities the United Kingdomaccepted 1,122,000 standards as her buying limit, it being understood thatthis figure could be increased if the availabilities proved larger than, theestimate.       The availabilities from each source were based on statements by the representative of the supplying country, except in the case of1.S.S.R. for which in the absence of information a total figure of 100,000st&amp;nd&amp;rds TO included.
The limits agreed for all countries wre:-&apos;000 StandardsBelgium - 147Netherlands - 210.5Denmark -I 103Switzerland - 47*5Prance - 200Italy - 117.5Norway - 18United Kingdom - . 11221965*54.     At a subsequent meeting of the Timber Sub-Committee at Copenhagenon 6th March, the Ccrra-.ittee split up each buying, country&apos;s quota by individual sources,  and recommended to E.E.C.E.  that no country shouldcontract for more than the amount allotted to it from each sourceseparately.      It also reconimended that if the total availability fromany exporting country fell short of the estimate,  the importing countries should agree to share the shortfall pro rat a.      At the subsequent meeting of E.E.C.E. itself the United Kingdom refused toaccept these recommendations on the ground that they would limit ourown activities without,  in practice,  substantially assisting purchasesby others, to whom supplying countries are less willing to sell.We have, however,  stated that we will abide by our total allocationfrom the estimated availabilities and, if these should increase, thatwe should adhere to our percentage of the total vis.   1 l/fjths. Afurther recommendation, was that special attention should be given bythe exporting countries to the needs of Belgium, the Netherlands andItaly, who had fared most badly in 1946.5.     The most recent review by the Timber Subcommittee, on 11th April,shows that, whereas the European countries have bought only smallproportions of their cpaotas,  the .United Kingdom has already placed firmcontracts for 856,000 standards likely to arrive in 1947, has bought afurther 60,000^100,000 standards from the U.S.A.  subject to export licence, and is far advanced with negotiations which should permit thepurchase of 175,000 standards in Sweden.      The United Kingdom totalis made up as follows:-
CanadaFinlandGermany. Brit. Zonedmer.

Our purchase of175,000 stcaiaards from Finland was me.de- possible only by the offer of substantial   luaubitics of steel in exchange; , and our purchases, in canada and U.S. A.. involve heavy expenditure of dollars.6.     The ether combers of the Committee, particularly the D;wales, Dutch and belgians, have expressed strong criticisms of the refusal of the; UnitedKingdom to agree to allocations by individual sources of supply;      and thisquestion has been adjourned for consideration at the next -meeting before theend of Hay.     Tec is also apparent that any further purchases -- e. g, fromRussia - .,111 bring our purchases above our total allocation of 1,122,000standards.7. The United Kingdom has offered at the most recent meeting of the TimberSub-Coniuittee to make available to any European country facilities fortimber in the British Zone of Germany ;    to refrain for two months from buying more -than 175,000 standards in Sweden;     and to avoid as far aspossible competitive buying in Czechoslovakia and other Centred EuropeanTnese concessions were, however,  regarded as entirely inadequate;en xndio^tlon by the TJ.3..1. that she would favour the grant of expertdeehcca to needy European countries met with no response, apparently becauseNetherlands, Denmark and Belgium are unable or unwilling to makepurchases in dollars.
-. . .2988.     In the light of the foregoing it is clear that the Committee canonly hold, together if we are prepared to limit or transfer some of our ownpurchases of timber in the interests of other countries.       Our requirementsof softwood for 1947 are estimated at 1,671,000 standards,  a large partbeing for housing  aid railways.     There is in any event little prospect of reaching this figure and the Question is briefly whether we discardprinciples of ink arrant ional allocation in. an effort to obtain everythingwe can, or whether, if the total availabilities forecast last February areexceeded arid we are in a position to obtain more thai the 1,122,000standards which is the allocation we have accepted on the basis of thepresent estimate, we should share out this excess on the same basis asthat on 7/hich the E.E.C.E.  quotas were originally drawn up.      This basis would give us 1l/l9ths of any additional availability.;9.     Attractive though it might a&apos;appear at first sight to take full advantage of our bargaining position and obtain all our requirements tothe maximvtm regardless of the position of other countries, I cannotconscientiously recommend this course for the following reasons:-(i) The co-ordination by E.E.G.E. of timber purchases is importantboth as -part of our general policy of assisting Europeanreconstruction and as a protection against excursions intothe timber allocating field by other bodies such as the Poodanti. Agriculture Organisation which has sue .oned an internationaltimber conference to meet at Prague on the 28th April,(ii) We have gone on record as adhering to the principle of allocation and as willing to abide by the 11/19ths ratio,(iii) If the Timber Sub-Comuittt .e of E.E.C.E. were to collapse itcould not fail to have a prejudicial effect on the -allocation of machinery for other commodities in short supply, which playsan important part in European reconstruction and from whichwe have derived many advantages.     &quot;Thus, through the medium of E.E.C.E.  and E.C.0., coal has been provided to Sweden and finland which has materially helped in our- purchases of softwoodand pitprops from these countries,(iv) We understand.       that Denmark is particularly disturbed at thecourse of events in timber and it is important that this should
not be allowed to disturb our other caanicroial relations withthis important    source of food.10.     I therefore propose that in addition, to the points mentioned inparagraph 1, we should:(a) Explore further with ropresentatives of countries such asDenmark and Holland, which can conveniently receive Germantimber, methods whereby softwood logs felled in Germany mightbe diverted to them.(b) Give an assurance through B..E.C.E.  that, if further purchaseswhich we may make in the; U.S.S.R.  or elsewhere bring our totalprobable arrivals in 1947 above 1,122,000 standards, we will beready, by transferring existing contracts or by other appropriate means, to make available to other member countries thatproportion of the excess (vis. a total of 8/19ths) to which theyshould be entitled in accordance with their original quota   ofthe total allocation.(c) Propose that any difficulties encountered by individual countriesin obtaining timber up to the full amount of their quotas as aresult of financial causes should be referred for considerationto  die appropriate organs of the United Nations.R.
