(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITaNOTC MaJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(U7) 10322ND MARCH,  19k7CABINETGAS AND ELECTRICITY RATIONING scheme memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and. power the Fuel Committee decided, on 20th March(F.0.(1+7) ll+th Meeting, Minute 2) to recommend, to the cabinet a rationing scheme under which the public would be required byOrder under the Defence Regulations to reduce their consumptionof gas and electricity during the summer to a standard allowance of so many units of gt s and electricity depending on the size of the family,  whether solid fuel was available and certain oth. rconsiderations.      Alternatively,  the reduction might be to a proportion of consumption for the corresponding period of 19k if this basis was more favourable to the consumer.2. The  scheme would come  into operation on 1st May andarrangements would be made for Local Fuel Overseers,  inconsultation with the Gas end Electricity Undertakings,  toexamine casts of excessive consumption.      The consumer would be given  an opportunity to explain the reasons for the excessconsumption and if the explanation were not satisfactory thequestion of a prosecution under the Defence Regulations would arise.      The Committee  realised that there might be a largenumber of such cases (even if as high &amp; proportion as 90 percent,  of households observed the restriction,  there would remainover one million who had not done  so) and that at  the outset,  atall events,  the vast majority would have to be dismissed with a warning,  leaving only a small proportion of the more flagrantcases for prosecution.3. The Committee agreed that an announcement of theGovernment&apos;s intention to introduce a scheme on these lines should be made in the   House of Commons during the course of thenext few days.      (Some notes for the announcement are given in annex I).      The way would then be  clear for  the Ministry of fuel and Power to begin discussions with the representatives of the gas and Electricity Undertakings and of the Local Fuel.Overseers(who are local Government officials)  on the machinery needed to bring the  scheme into operation:      the latter will probablyneed to recruit another 2,000 or so clerks.1+. These discussions will also cover the size of theminimum standard scale  (the  scale that will be  tabled for these discussions is given in Annex II).      The standard scale at thelevel shown in the Annex,  together with an alternative of 50 percent,  of previous consumption,  would,  allowing for inevitablelatitude in enforcement, be needed to save 2 million tons ofcoal on domestic gas and electricity during the summer months.These figures should not be announced, however,  until they havebeen discussed with ohe Gas and Electricity Undertakings.COPY NO.      .      /&apos;
5o There will also have to be meetings with a numberof women&apos;s organisations (such as the W.V.S.,  the &quot;Women&apos; sInstitute,  the &quot;women&apos; s Co-operative Guilds, the ElectricalAssociation for Women and the Women &apos;.e Gas Council),  todiscuss the size of th...- ration and other features of thescheme.      With these organisations and also with variousyouth organisations will be uiscussed the establishment ofa corps of volunteer meter readers &quot;on call&quot; to householderswho want help in regular meter-reading.      It is vital to thesuccess of  the scheme that householders watch and controlthuir consumption by regular weekly meter readings - but somewill never learn to do so without help,,6. While the Committee are agreed on the general principles on which a scheme should be based, there is as yet no scheme and a great deal of work remains to be done;      inparticular the application of a similar restriction by reference to past consumption to establishments, shops,  officehotels end the like (for which there can in general be nostandard scale) will have to be worked out.      The variousproblems and consultations will have to be tacklea with greatenergy if a detailed scheme  is to be ready for publication bythe end of April to begin operation on 1st May.E. o.Ministry of Iruel and Powur, S.W.  1.,22nd March,  1947.
ANNEX IGAS AND ELECTRICITY RATIONINGNotes for Announcement to Parliament1. - The present arrangements prohibiting the use ofelectricity in residential premises during certain hours willbe maintained for the time being and householders must continue to exercise great economy in the use of both gas and electricity.      As soon as possible the prohibitions will bereplaced by a gas and electricity rationing scheme under whichconsumers will be required to reduce their consumption of gasand electricity during the coming Summer months to a householdscale which will prescribe the number of units of gas and electricity appropriate to households of varying sizes.      Asan alternative,  if it is more favourable to them, householderswill be allowed as their permitted level of consumption a proportion of their consumption in the corresponding periodlast year.      The scale will be used by those who have norecorded previous consumption in the same premises:    this willbe the case for new houses and for some of the households usingpre-payment meters.      Special provision will be made in thescale for children and elderly people and the advice of women1sorganisations will be sought before the scale is finally settled.2.        -      The standard scale and proportion of previousconsumption are not yet settled hut if we are to achieve anysubstantial fuel saving to help to keep industry running andto build up stocks for the winter, the reduction will have tobe drastic and roust entail for many people some change in theirordinary way of life where that has involved considerable useof gas and electric fires or constant supplies of hot water for baths,  etc.  during the Summer months.      But it is better that as big savings as possible should he secured in the summer than that the full burden should be left over to theWinter.      The scheme will be continued next Winter but therewill be allowances for the additional fuel required by thecolder weather.3. There will in the coming weeks he discussions withthe re&quot;presentatives of the Gas and Electricity Supply undertaking and. of the Local Fuel Overseers on the scheme generally and onthe machinery to operate it.      Consumers who exceed the permittedlevel of consumption will be liable to prosecution under theDefence Regulations hut before this question is considered theconsumer will be given a full opportunity to explain anyspecial circumstances that may have been responsible for the excess consumption.4. Women&apos;s organisations and the various youth organisations will be con.su3.ted regarding the enlistment ofvolunteer meter-readers who,  if the householder wishes it,will help him to read his gas and electricity metersregularly.      Meter reading is sometimes a troublesome &quot;businessbut it is vital to the success  of the rationing scheme thatthe householder should by regular weekly meter-reading knowhow his consumption is going.      The Government appeal to thoseorganisations to do their utmost to help in the matter - thereare over 14 ra.  households and at the outset at all events a quarter of a million volunteers prepared to help in this wayif called upon would not be too many.
5. Parsllel action will be taken to impose restrictionson the gas&apos;1 and electricity consumption of shops,  offices,places of entertainment and other non-industrial establishments.6. Discussions with various organisations and other interests concerned will necessarily take some time but theywill be pressed on with as rapidly as is consistent with a proper degree of consultation,  and it is hoped that it maybe possible to announce details&quot; of the scheme by the end ofApril.      Until then it will not be possible to add -feo theinformation now given.      Consumers should in the meantimeexercise great  economy in gas and electricity consumption and should get into the habit of checking the progress oftheir economies by regular meter-reading.
