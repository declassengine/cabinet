(47)  13928th April,  1947.CABINETOC^ALj._ALLOCATIONS TO industry note by the Secretary to the Cabinet1. At the Cabinet * s meeting this - morning (CM. (47) bothConclusions, Minute 1)  reference was made to the proposedallocations of coal to industry during the  period 1st June to31st October,  1947.2. By the Prime Minister&apos;s direction I circulate,  forthe information of the Cabinet,   a memorandum on this subject which was submitted to the Fuel Committee by the President ofthe Board of Trade  (Annex I).       The proposals  put forward inthis memorandum were considered by the Fuel Committee on21st April.      The Committee then -approved the proposal inparagraph 9 of the memorandu,  viz.  that industries shouldreceive,  from 1st June to 31 at October, 1947,  for consumption and stocking,  the amount of coal which they consumed in the sameperiod of 1946.      The President of the Board of Trade was authorised to inform both sides of industry of this decision,and to make an announcement in Parliament on the subject at theearliest possible date.3. I also circulate (Annex II) the text of the statement which the President of the Board of Trade was proposing to makein pursuance of that decision.(Signed)    NORMAN brook cabinet Office,28th April,
1.   At the meeting of the Fuel Committee on the 2nd April (F.C.(47)19th Meeting Conclusion 3) it pas agreed that the allocation of coal to industry until the end of flay should be increased by 100,000 tons a week at the expense of stock-building for power stations and domestic and miscellaneous consumption.     Following on this decision the basic coalallocation to industry in general has been increased, as from theIgth April, from 33 z per cent, to 50 per cent, while supplements from the regional pools, which are now rather smaller than before, are being reviewed in the light of the increase in the basic allocation.2,,   The arrangements described above will continue until the end ofMay.     It is now/ necessary to decide, urgently, what arrangements shallbe made for the distribution of coal to industry In the five remainingmonths of the summer period in order (a) that industry may know where it stands for the remainder of the summer period and may make its plansaccordingly;    and (b) that re-progr waning of-coal allocations to individual firms on a summer basis (allocations on a summer basis comeinto effect normally on the 1st May), taking into account whatever cutit is necessary to ieipose, can be put in hand without fr.il at the end ofthis month with a view to their coming into effect on the 1st June.3-   As requested at the meeting of the Fuel Committee on the 7th March(F.C.(47) 11th Meeting Conclusion 3(2)), I have considered what revised scheme for the allocation of coal to industry would be necessary on theassumption that the allocation for consumption in the summer months wouldbe 17.6 million tons cf coal compared witti estimated requirements of 26.million tons-     These ere the figures upon which the Committee agreed attheir meeting on the 7th March when the coal budget for the suiimer monthswas approved (p.0.(47) 11th Meeting Conclusion 3(l)) and which I announced during the Debate on the Economic Situation,,     Whatever arrangements are adopted must depend very largely on the size of the deficit on which weare to base our plans.     It is quite clear that if we are to plan on thebasis of a. deficit as large as one third, it will be necessary to discriminate widely between industries and between firms and elaborateadministnative arrangements both at the centre and in the region will berequired in order to give effect to the necessary priorities.     It isdifficult to see how a scheme of this complexity could be put into effect by the 1st June.     On the other hand, If the deficit were comparatively small, a far simpler scheme, the deta.ils of which could be settledcomparatively quickly, would meet the oo.se.     It is,  in any event, vital that a decision should be reached urgently on what assumptions regardingsupplies for industry we are now- to plan the allocation arra.ngem.ents afterthe end of May and for the remainder of the summer period.4.    I consider thai a cut of one-third in industria.1 consumption wouldbe disastrous.     It far exceeds the reduction in industry&apos;s consumption ofcoal in the past few months as disclosed by the returns issued by theMinistry of Fuel and Power,.     In no week of the crisis did consumption fall-by so much;    and over the whole period since the beginning of February itis unlikely that industry has been denied more than 2 million tons of coalin all.     Even this reduction will cost us, at a moderate estimate,  100million in exports;    it has a.lrea.dy reduced the supply of steel to the17th i,?ril, 1947.../CABINETFDEL COMMITTEECOAL EOR INDUSTRY DURING- THE SUMMERMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.
lowest level since the depression of the early thirties;    and nearly every important raw material, including chemicals, paper, textileyarns, and building materials, has suffered severely.     The recentcut in the clothing ration, for example, does no more than offset the anticipated loss of output to the end of April and will not prevent an equally drastic reduction in exports.5.    A reduction in the average consumption of industry as a wholeby one-third coming on top of the present dislocation and shortages,would be a. much more serious affair.     More than half the coal-consumed by industry is needed to make basic materials such as steel,chemicals, paper, cement, textile yarns, etc., and the requirementsof .the finishing industries are comparatively modest.     By cutting&apos;industrial coal consumption, therefore, we should be starving industry of raw materials and ensuring thai not only the basic industries butalso a.ll subsequent stages of manufa.ctu.re will suffer.     It is notdifficult to predict how the cut would fall on the main coal-consuming industries.      It would probably imply a. slump in the outputof steel to an annual rate of about 9 million ingot tons as comparedwith. 12.7 million Ingot tons achieved in 1946 when there was an acutecvei-all shortage of steel.      It would involve a reduction of one-third or more in the output of basic chemicals such a.s alkali,sulphuric field and soda ash leading to bottlenecks over a wide field.,In the textile industries we should be faced with the completeabandonment of cur expert trade and all hope-of maintaining the clothing ration even at its present level would pass away.     Therewould be a grave shortage of all kinds of paper and packingmaterials. 0. drastic curtailment in the production of building materials, a. famine in pottery and many other household goods, and0. complete disorganisation of the engineering industry throughshortages of materials and components.     Even the food-processingindustries could not v/holly escape.6.   At ail costs, therefore, we must avoid submitting industryto so large a cut, which would not only cause widespreadunemployment over the summer but would also, because of the disturbance to supplies of materials and components, create justthat dislocation in industry in the winter months thai the building up of stocks is intended to avoid,     Wo should seek to preserve a proper balance between the level of activity in summer and winterrather than divide the year arbitrarily and concentrate the cutcn the first half.7.   Since the estimate of 89 million tons of coal as the probablesupply this summer was approved by the Fuel Committee there havebeen certain favourable factors that would justify a mere hopefulview of coal supplies.      It y/as expected at that time that thenumber of miners at the beginning of May would have fallen to680,000 and thai the reduction v/ould still be in progress.    Insteadwe are fahrly certain to start the new coal  year with 710,000miners (of whom a slightly higher proportion will be face workers)and there is a reasonable prospect thai this number will continueto increa.se rather than diminish.     It means that if manpowerremains at 710,000 wo may obtain nearly 5 per cent more coaJL overthe summer than we had anticipated,-    and it also implies a muchmore hopeful position next winter..8*   Because of the increase in manpower, we should now be ableto reckon on, say, an a.additional L million tons of coal over the summer, unless other things have changed for the worse.     We a.realso likely to end the coal year with at least half a million moretons of coal than we previously assumed.     These two circumstancestogether should reduce the deficit of 8.6 million tons to 4 million tons*   In the light of these more favourable prospects, I proposethat we should revise the coal budget so as to allow industry toreceive for consumption and stocks the amount of coal which itconsumed last summer.     The requirements of industry in the budget
E.S.CBoard of Trade,Millbank,S.W.1.17th April, 1947.are put at 26*2 million tons for consumption and 1,8 million tons forstocking and if my proposal is accepted industry will be allocated24.3 million tons or 86,8/J of requirements plus stocking up allowance.Those figures refer to the six months May to October and will have to be adjusted to a five monthly basis since we have already agreed uponallocations for Hay.     Adjustments will be necessary in order to allow for savings through oil conversion and provision must be made for the needsof factories that have come into operation since last summer.     It ishoped that those adjustments will be self-balancing.      I should wish to announce to industry, as scon as possible, that this was to bo the basisof allocation over the summer months and that:firms would be expected idaccumulate a stock equal to 3 weeks1 winter requirements by the end ofOctober.     Firms would, however, be free to use the coal delivered to them as they chose j    and it would be mo.de abundantly clear that stocksaccumulated from the deliveries promised would not he token into account(up to a limit of,  say 6-8 weeks) In  rawing the winter allocations.If we can augment supplies of coal, either because production is inexcess of the estimate or from imports or through savings in other directions- we could make arrangements for supplementary deliveimes tcindustry either to facilitate stocking or to meet the increased needs ofthe basic industries.10.   These proposals do not involve any amendment to the other items onthe coal budget providing stock building at the -power stations is notconcentrated on the early part of&apos;the summer rather than spread In thenormal way over the summer period.     The Minister of Fuel and power had expressed his alarm in F.0.(47) 68 at the postponement of stockbuildirr;at the power stations until dune and emphasised the danger that this mayprevent the achievement of the October target of L.!Ij5 million tons.     T.do not think that we should be swayed by these fears into a policy of cutting industrial consumption more severely.     Stocks at the power;stations have already   reached 1.8 million tons and if deliveries reach,the planned rate of 558,COO tons per1 week,  stocks will continue toincrea.se.     Requirements for consumption in the summer months ore put at450,000 tons per week In the coal budget upon which we agreed last month and stock building should absorb not much more than 100,000 tons per weekif stocks are to reach the planned total of 4-25 million tons by october.     Thus the summer rate of delivery need not average more thanthe rate planned for April and May if the budget figures are to beachieved.11.    No doubt there are dangers in revising the estimates in the waysuggested.     But In view of the grave dislocation, unemployment and lossof output and exports that ,are certadn ever at lea.st the next 12 months from a reduction as large as that previously envisaged (33&apos;sfi), I feelthat wo should take the calculated risk of limiting the cut on industryover the summer as I have proposed.If it should turn out as the summer proceeds that our estimates have been too optimistic some further cut could then be imposed.     This:would be far better than making the cut now, dislocating the whole ofour industry to a ruinous extent and then finding that there was a surplus cf coal.12.    I invite my colleagues, therefore, to agree to the propo.sa.1 iiiparagraph 9 and that I should make a public announcement to this effect as soon as possible.
ANNEX II&apos;   SUMMER SUPPLIES OP COAL TO INDUSTRYDraft of proposed Statement in the House of Commons by thePresident of the Board, of trade the Government have carefully considered what suppliesof coal can be allocated to industry over the summer months fromthe 1st June onwards.      The full stock-building programme to power stations, gas works and other  consumers as already announcedmust he carried out.      While the manpower position in the miningindustry has shown  improvement since the statement I made duringthe Debate on the Economic Situation on the 10th March,  there isa clear risk in planning allocations to industry at a higher level; than I then  indicated, in view  of the uncertainty which must remain concerning output &apos;during the  summer.      On the other hand,the Government cannot fail to be impressed by the fact that supplies at such a level would cause not only great  industrialdislocation during the summer but  also create shortages ofmaterials and components which must  seriously prejudice theoperation of industry throughout next &quot;winter.following consultation With both sides of industry,therefore,  the Government have decided that supplies of coal to each industry between the 1st June and the 31st October shall be planned at a level equal to consumption during the summer of lastyear,  subject to appropriate adjustments for oil conversion.In general,  this will mean that supplies to individual firms willbe based on the same rate of consumption as last summer.      Itwill be for firms to build up,  from the deliveries they receive,s stock sufficient to meet three weeks&apos;  winter requirements by theend of October.       If larger stocks are accumulated,  these willnot be taken into account in framing the winter allocations.
If firms fail to accumulate a three weeks&apos;  stock,  the winterallocations will nevertheless &quot;be based on the assumption thatsuch a stock is,  in fact,  held.It must be appreciated that in estimating supplies for industry at this level a considerable risk is deliberatelybeing taken and that the success of this endeavour to avoid the grave results of cutting down industrial activity duringthe whole of the summer must depend both on the maintenanceof a high&apos;rate of put put of coal and upon the full co-operationof industrial undertakings in effecting all possible economies and in building up stocks for the winter.      If we start next winter with insufficient stocks, we expose ourselves to even greater difficulties than we experienced last winter,  and firmsmust make it their individual responsibility to lay aside forthe winter a sufficient stock out of current deliveries.
