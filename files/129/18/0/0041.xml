DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TCP. ( 47 ) 141S9TH APRIL,   1947CABINETFUEL ALLOCATIONS TO BUILDING MATERIALS industries memorandum by the Minister of Health,  the Secretaryof State for Scotland,  and the &quot;Minister of&quot;Works1. We are seriously concerned at the effect upon thehuilding materials industries of the interpretation which, weunderstand, has teen placed upon the Fuel Committee&apos;s decisionof 21st April (F. C. (4?\) 17th Meeting,  Minute 3).2. Paragraph 9 of the memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (F.C.(47) 80) proposed to allow industry the amount of coal which it consumed last summer and went onto state that &quot;industry will be allocated ....  24.3 million tons or 86.87b of requirements plus stocking up allowance&quot;.We assumed that each industry and each works would receiveabout 86% of its requirements plus stocking up allowance.This would have given the building materials works equaltreatment with other works;    hitherto,  of course,  they havehad a priority.5. It is now proposed that each industry shouldreceive what .it received last summer whatever its requirementsmay be this summer, without allowance for works which haveexpanded their production.      Allowance is to be made forentirely new works that have started up since last summerbut not for expansion in existing works.      It is this failure to allow for expansion which would have such a serious effect upon the building materials industries.4. The building materials industries were notoriouslylagging behind the general economic effort in 1946 and shortageof materials would indeed have been far more serious than itwas in practice had it not been for the existence of largeaccumulated stocks which were gradually dissipated during theyear and are now exhausted.      Extreme efforts were thereforemade by the Government to secure expansion, with the resultthat a ve;ry large number of works re-opened in the earlier part of 1946 and proceeded to light kiln after kiln at inter-vals of weeks or months according to the individualcircumstances.      (The Appendix shows the resulting productionin a number of the industries in May and October, 1946.)     Thenew proposal fails to give full credit for any kiln lightedafter May,  1945,  and would take no account at all of any kilnlighted after October.      If it. is adopted, the building materials industries would relapse to a level of productionbelow that of last October and generally far below the levelof requirements for the building programme.      In the case ofbricks, for example, the allowance of fuel would amount toabout two thirds of requirements  (compared with 86% forCOPY NO. ^ j
industry as a&quot; whole) and the monthly rate of productionof Pricks would then only he little over half of theestimated requirements for the &quot;building programme.      Inthe case of salt-glazed pipes the supply of fuel and theproduction would in each case be about three quarters  ofwhat is required.      All this would  inevitably&quot;lead to a widespread shortage of employment in the buildingindustry.5. This cannot be looked at as  a mere shortterm matter of a few months only;    what is done nowdictates  the prospects for &quot;building materials  in 1948and beyond.      The financial resources of many firms,particularly in the clay industries,  are small.      labour is notoriously reluctant to enter the industries  and oncelost will not return.    -We have encouraged the firms totake a confident view of the future,  to expand, and toimprove their efficiency and amenities on the basis of future prospects.      We are afraid that if the government now refuse to take account of the expansion that  theyhave succeeded in achieving,  they could no longer have any confidence in our good faith.6. We are seriously concerned about the  effectof the proposal upon the Government housing programme.Taking bricks as an example,  the total supply would belittle more than the requirements for house-building alone,so that,  at any rate in a few months&apos;   time,  there wouldbe a marked reduction in the rate at which new housescould be started and therefore subsequently in the rateof new completions.      The rate of house-building wouldbe reduced to about half the pre-war rate and would amount to an abandonment cf the Governments pledges onthe housing question.      One of the most serious effectswill bo that the building operatives will be soured bya repetition   by this&apos; Government of the procedure underwhich the building industry is expanded on the promise ofa large and continuous house-building programme which issubsequently cut.      To repeat this lamentable history so soon would be most unfortunate.      If this policy iscarried out,   it would mean that at a very early date inevery town and village houses would be standing at various stages of construction with work stopped  andin mute protest against the decision of&quot; the Government.7. Implemenatation of the present proposal meansnot merely the loss of priority hitherto accorded to housing but the reduction of housing, not indeed on apar with other industry but to the last place  in thequeue.      We hope that a proposal will not be adoptedwhich, in effect will in 1947 give the building materialsindustries a smaller percentage of their fuel requirementsthan is to be enjoyed this year by industry in general.A.
