The Location of Inter-Governmental Organisations.C. Co-ordination of the work of International Organisations.2.   This working party consisted of :  Mr. Gladwyn Jebb, Foreign Office (Chairman).Sir William Matthews, Treasury.   (Member of the United NationsAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.)Sir Herbert Broadley, Ministry of Food.Sir Guildhaume Myrrdin Evans, Ministry of Labour and NationalService.

Pitblado, Treasury.Mr P. Mason, Foreign Office.3. It took cognisance not only of the Cabinet directive referred to in para-graph 1 of the Report A, but also of a further directive given to the foreign secretary in July of last year respecting the subject matter of Report C. TheWorking Party had no explicit mandate to produce Report B; but since theprinciples affecting the location of the Specialised Agencies had so great a bearing on the work of the individual Secretariats and the general co-ordinationof effort, it seemed to them best (and I entirely concur) to provide an analysis inthe light of which Ministers would be able to take a final decision. My own proposals, which I would urge my colleagues to accept, are as follows.Report A4. We should agree with the conclusions of the Working Parti/, and, incommunicating them to our Permanent Representative with the United Nations,urge him to do his best to see that Mr. Lie is convinced of the necessity in hisown interests of applying for permission to appoint a permanent Deputy, whowould be in charge of both the Economic and Social Departments and also tosome extent, as regards administrative problems, act as a bufferSecretary-General and the Assistant Secretary-General in charge of Adminis-tration.[33384] B
Repor-t B5. Though the proposal to concentrate the Food and Agriculture Organisa-tion, the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organisation, andpossibly one or two others, in Geneva, together with the Economic and SocialDepartments of the Secretariat, has some attractions, I can only regard withdismay the splitting-up of the United Nations Organisation which any such scheme would imply. The Americans, I  eel sure, would regard theproposal as a first step towards removing the United Nations from america; and in this they would not, I think, be very far wrong,seeing that in a few years&apos; time it is quite possible that the Economic and social work of the United Nations may become much more important thanthe political. If this turned out to be the case, then there might well be anirresistible pull exercised by Geneva on the remaining part of the Organisation.In any case, certain organisations (such as the Trusteeship Council and possibly the Atomic Energy Commission) which would, under this scheme, remain in new York, seem likely to cover both the political and economic field, and itmight be most undesirable to deprive them of immediate contact with theEconomic and Social Council. Finally, from the administrative point of view,Mr. Lie&apos;s difficulties would be greatly increased and, indeed, I do not knowhow he could be expected to carry on if he had to be responsible for the workingof any such system. / therefore reach the conclusion that Scheme C (para-graph 14) of Report B is unacceptable.6. If that is so, and assuming that complete dispersal is undesirable (asI think it is), there are in practice only two alternatives left, namely, concen-tration in Geneva of the Organisations concerned, or concentration in New York.As between these two alternatives I have no doubt that we ought to recommend the latter. Apart from the fact that the I.L.O. will almost certainly decide to go to New York if the Economic and Social Secretariats stay there, I am by no means convinced that the disadvantages of New York are so great as theyare painted. Indeed, it is admitted (see second sentence of paragraph 12 ofEeport B) that the activities of &quot; pressure groups&quot; quite often recoil on theirown heads, while the advantages of New York as regards economy of effort, man-power and (I myself believe) on balance of money, are universally admitted.Consequently, I would urge my colleagues to accept Scheme A.Report G7. Report C consists of a number of recommendations for action by HisMajesty&apos;s Government designed to secure the better co-ordination of the workof International Organisations. The conclusions put forward by the working party seem to me sensible and / recommend their adoption by my colleagues.H. McN.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,28*A March, 1947.REPORT ATHE SECRETARIATS OF THE  UNITED NATIONS ANDSPECIALISED AGENCIES(Report of the Interdepartmental Working Party)Cabinet Instruction1.   At their meeting on 7th November, 1946 (CM. (46) 95th Conclusions).The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a small working party of officials to draw up a report on the working of the secretariat of the United Nations and some of the specialised agencies; and asked that this report should be submitted to the Cabinet in cluecourse.
Preparation and Contents of this Paper2. The United Kingdom Delegation to the second part of the first sessionof the General Assembly made a careful study of the question of the functioning of the Secretariat of the United Nations, as a result of which I wrote a paper on the Personalities and the Functioning of the Secretariat.&apos; This paper (whichcan be made available if required) was studied by an Inter-departmental working party, the composition of which is given in my covering minute. The conclusionsof the Working Party are now submitted.3. Observations of the working of the Secretariats of some of the principalspecialised agencies have been submitted by the Departments primarily concerned and these will be found in Appendices I-V of this paper. The agencies coveredare : The International Labour Organisation (Appendix I).The Food and Agriculture Organisation (Appendix II).The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Appen-dix III).The International Fund (Appendix III).U.N.E.S.C.O. (Appendix IV).The Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation (Appen-dix V).These Agencies are in widely different stages of development, from the provedand efficient machine of the International Labour Office to the experimental and,at present, imprecise arrangements for the running of U.N.E.S.G.O. A separate paper is being submitted on the co-ordination of the activities of the variousAgencies; in this present paper it is simply suggested that one of the responsi-bilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to keep a careful watch on the workingof the Secretariat of each Agency of which the United Kingdom is a Member.Functioning of the Secretariat of the United NationsHistorical and General4. The Secretariat of the San Francisco Conference which drew up theUnited Nations Charter was almost exclusively American. The formation of atruly international Secretariat, ultimately to become the United Nations Secre-tariat, started with my appointment, in July 1945, as Executive Secretary of thePreparatory Commission. I built up a temporary staff in London whicheventually amounted to some 700 people, of all ranks. A considerable proportionof these moved with the United Nations to New York, where the staff now oom-prises slightly less than 3,000 people, though there are unconfirmed rumours atthe moment of writing that 500 have recently been given notice. The Genevaoffice of the United Nations employs rather over 100. (The League of Nationsstaff in the late 1930&apos;s amounted to some 6.50 people all told..)5. Under Article 97 of the Charter, the entire Secretariat of the united nations is under the Secretary-General as &quot;&apos; Chief Administrative Officer.&apos;&apos;&apos; Heis assisted by eight Assistant Secretaries-General, in charge respectively of departments dealing with Political and Security matters, Economic, Social,Trusteeship and Dependent Territories, Conference and General Services, budget and Administration, Information and Legal matters. The chief responsibilityfor the good or bad functioning of the Secretariat falls, apart from the Secretary-General, principally upon the Assistant Secretary-General for Administration,and it has been one of the chief weaknesses of the Secretariat that between april 1946 and January 1947 this position was in deplorably feeble hands. Achange has now been made and it is to be hoped that an improvement will follow.6. In commenting upon the work of the Secretariat, one naturally seeksa standard of comparison^ and the most convenient standard is the working ofthe United Kingdom Cabinet Secretariat in Whitehall. The analogy mustimmediately be recognised as imperfect. The Whitehall Secretariat works fora. team of Ministers whose general political objectives are the same and whoobserve certain rules of team work, all being subject to the final decision of theCabinet. In the United Nations, on the other hand, the Secretariat serve somefifty-five nations with divergent interests, different languages and methods, anddifferent standards of international constitutional behaviour. Moreover, membersof the Secretariat themselves come from different backgrounds, and forms of[33384] b 2
collaboration which come naturally to officials of one country have to be worked out among officials with totally different experiences and training. But in spit&quot;of all these differences there is much in the technique of the Cabinet Secretariatmachine which might be adapted with profit by any Agency performing secretarialfunctions on a big scale. There may be advantage, therefore, for suggesting quiteinformally to the new Assistant Secretary-General for Administration that on some visit to the United Kingdom he might find it useful to be shown something of the Whitehall Secretariat arrangements in action, in case there are standards and practices which could be applied in the international sphere.Conclusions7. The following are the conclusions at which the Working Party havearrived regarding the functioning of the United Nations Secretariat:  &apos;(i) The Secretary-General, despite certain attractive personal qualities, is nota good leader or a good administrator. He is inclined either to take wrong-decisions, or, more often, to take no decision at all on matters on which a directiveis needed.(ii) These defects could be remedied by the appointment of one or moreDeputies. There is a strong case for three Deputies, one of whom would takethe Political, Trusteeship Information and LegalDepartments, a second Economicand Social, and a third Conference and General Services and Administration.Two objections to this set-up, however, seem to be decisive : (a) the appointmentof as many as three Deputies would amount to lowering the status of the existingAssistant Secretaries-General; (b) there would be great difficulty in finding threesuitable persons in such a way that efficiency was secured and equitablegeographical distribution of offices, particularly among the Great Powers,preserved. Therefore, the best course would probably be the appointment of onereally good Deputy, whose principal tasks, apart from acting as a general bufferfor Mr. Lie and taking his place when absent, would be to watch over administra-tion and co-ordinate the work of the Economic and Social Departments (whichat present is unco-ordinated to the detriment of the work). It would be better,however, to have no Deputy rather than to have the wrong man.(The suggestions made in this paragraph are made on the assumption thatthe headquarters of all the organs of the United Nations remain in New York;if, however, as is discussed in a separate paper on the location of intergovern-mental organisations, the bulk of the Economic and Social Departments of theUnited Nations Secretariat should transfer elsewhere so as to be nearer certainspecialised agencies, then there would be a need for two Deputies rather thanone; one in charge of the whole Economic and Social &quot; Branch &quot; and the otherwith responsibility for administration as a whole.)(iii) If the new Assistant Secretary-General for Administration, Mr. ByronPrice (United States) turns out to be a success, there will be three ableAssistant Secretaries-General, the other two being Mr. A. A. Sobolev (U.S.S.R.:Political and Security) and Mr. David Owen (United Kingdom: economic affairs). Mr.&apos;Sobolev, though probably the most able and forceful member oftlhe Secretariat, is unfortunately widely suspected of carrying out his dutieswitihout sufficient regard for the impartiality enjoined upon the Secretariat bythe Charter. Mr. Owen, though he has many virtues, is not too well fitted forthe particular post which he occupies, having been chosen for it in the absenceof a better candidate. The remaining five Assistant Secretaries-General* aresecond-rate and will probably always be a liability. If they can be encouraged to take their pensions early, or otherwise induced to go, so much the better.(iv) The greater part of the other senior members of the Secretariat, on theother hand, are hard-working, and on the whole able. They suffer, however, fromthe prevailing absence of leadership and purpose at Lake Success, and it mustbe admitted that there is a sad absence of distinction about the personnelgenerally, which includes very few figures with an international reputation intheir particular spheres. Among the very few exceptions are Dr. Nctestem(United States: Population Division) and Mr. Campion (United Kingdom:Statistical Office). The above criticism is particularly applicable to the depart-ments of Economic and Social Affairs which contain no eminent economist orsociologist.* M. Henri Laugier :  -France (Social Affairs).Dr. Victor Hoo :  China (Trusteeship).Dr. Adrian Pelt : Netherlands (Conference and General Services).Mr. Benjamin Cohen :  Chile (Information).Dr. Ivan Kerno :   Czechoslovakia (Legal Matters).
5JL t$ fa(v) Mr. Lie expressed the intention after the Assembly which concluded inDecember 1946 to take stock and dispense with about one-third of his purely temporary staff in the interests of efficiency, and it is understood that a smallteam is now working on this under the leadership of Mr. Spencer Thompson(United States). The results of these moves may well be disappointing, and theUnited Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary questions(of which Sir William Matthews is a member) should scrutinise what is donevery carefully.(vi) Until such time as the new offices are built in Manhattan and the Secre-tariat is working on long-term contracts instead of the temporary arrangements which still operate as regards the bulk of the staff, efficiency is not likely to beat ia maximum, and will certainly not approach that of the League of NationsSecretariat in its good days.(vii) There is considerable overlapping and confusion, chiefly in the Depart-ments of Conference and General Services, and Administration. Part of this is inevitable in the process of the setting up of a new organisation and part maybe rectified by the new Head of the Administration Department; but the wholedistribution of functions in these two Departments should be the subject of early review.(viii) In any case, though the total strength may well be reduced from itspresent figure of nearly three thousand, it is inevitable that the Secretariat shouldbe far larger than the League of Nations Secretariat. This is largely becauseunder the Charter and as a result of subsequent decisions of the Assembly, theUnited Nations Secretariat has to cope with a far larger volume of work thanthe League ever did. Contributing factors are, however, wasteful Americanmethods of administration, resulting in excessive sectionalisation, and a tendencyby certain sections towards &quot;empire-building.&quot;(ix) In the aggregate the distribution of nationalities among the Secretariatis not unsatisfactory. (A statement by nationality of Senior Executive personnelas at December 1948 is in Appendix VI.) There is, however, an undue prepon-derance of United States citizens on the administrative side of the Secretariat,particularly in those sections dealing with applications for employment and withrecruitment. It is understood that Mr. Lie intends to change this, but it willprobably be necessary to keep up pressure to ensure that he does. It is also desirable that there should be a greater proportion of members of the Secretariatfrom Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India. It will also be notedthat, alone among the Great Powers, the U.S.S.R. is seriously under-represented;it is not clear how we can do much about this particular anomaly.(x) The United Kingdom contingent is reasonably high in quality, tolerablywell-placed strategically and as numerous as can legitimately be expected.(xi) There is reason to suppose that the Secretariat will become more efficientas time goes on provided that it does not become disheartened by the defectivefunctioning of the Organisation, by the lack of leadership or, more immediately,asi a result of the further increases in the cost of living affecting especially themiddle and lower grades.(xii) Unsatisfactory as it still is, efficiency has definitely been on the up-gradesince the Secretariat was transplanted in the summer of 1946 from HunterCollege to Lake Success.(xiii) The location of the offices, which necessitates long daily journeys forthe great majority of the staff, and the conditions of work in the converted factory building are not such as to make for the maximum efficiency of working.(xiv) We do not recommend presenting Mr. Lie with any written criticisms of the working of the Secretariat until we have had rather more experience perhaps until after the end of the next General Assembly (about November 1947).We suggest, however, that we might now sound a number of Delegationsinformally, particularly those of the United States, Canada, Australia andFrance, as regards possible means of improving the organisation of the Secretariaton the lines suggested in this Report.(Signed, on behalf of the Working Party),GLADWYN JEBB, Chairman.
APPENDIX I TO REPORT AINTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATIONOrganisation and Staffing of the secretarial the International Labour Organisation is, by the standards of inter-govern-mental organisations generally, a most efficient and economical organisation. Itpossesses an able, devoted and loyal staff. Many of the administrative members have been with the Organisation for years, and most of them are either hand-picked or entered the secretariat by competitive examination. The standard of performance, therefore, although there are inevitably some weaker brethren andsisters, is on the whole very high.At the outbreak of war the number of staff in post was about 400. Duringthe war the great majority of the staff were either retired or suspended, only askeleton staff being retained, mainly at Montreal but with a small nucleus also at Geneva. Since 1943-44 a process of rebuilding the staff has been going on,partly by the re-employment of former members, partly by the introduction of new members. The staff in post at 1st February was about 320 (190 at Montreal and130 at Geneva). Recruitment is now going on steadily, partly by individualselection but supplemented by the return to the system of competitive examination;and an establishment of 486 for 1948 has been approved by the governing body and will be submitted to the Conference in June next. The proportion of UnitedKingdom subjects is reasonably high, particularly in positions of responsibility,although pending retirements may modify the position somewhat in the nearfuture.On the question of economical administration the I.L.O., although now nearlythirty years old, probably has the smallest budget of any of the specialised agencies. Thus, despite the General Conferences at Montreal and Seattle, a regional Conference of American States at Mexico City, four industrial com-mittees (two in the United States and two at Brussels, attended by from 100 to200 delegates, the expenses of two-thirds of whom are carried on the budget ofthe organisation), four meetings of the governing body and a host of other meetingsas well as the ordinary administrative work of the office, expenditure in 1946amounted to 11,603,991-54 Swiss francs. The budget for 1947 is just under16 million Swiss francs and the budget for 1948, just approved by the governing body for submission to the Conference in June, is only 18-1 million Swiss francsin spite of the increased number of staff budgeted for and substantial improve-ments in the emoluments of the staff.The Head of the Office is the Director-General, Mr. E. J. Phelan (Eire).Although not possessing so colourful a personality as some of his predecessors,Mr. Phelan is a quite brilliant administrator. Mr. Phelan became Acting-Director in 1941 after Mr. Winant&apos;s resignation to take the post of United states ambassador to London. He directed the affairs of the Organisation fromMontreal and was responsible for the organisation of the war-time conferencesat New York in 1941 and Philadelphia in 1944, which, despite enormousdifficulties, were outstandingly successful. He was made Flead of the Office inSeptember 1946 with retrospective effect to February 1941 and his title changed to Director-General. He is due to retire on reaching the age of 60 in May 1948and will be most difficult to replace.The budget carries a post of Deputy-Director, but this has hitherto been filledonly exceptionally for political or pressing administrative reasons. Thus theappointment as Director-General for political reasons of a person who possessesno administrative gifts (as has happened) renders it essential to have a Deputy-Director to supervise the work of the Office.There are five posts of Assistant Director, three of these being filled byMr. Lindsay Rogers (United States), Mr. Jef Rens (Belgium) and Mr, G. A.Johnston (Great Britain).Of the remaining two posts of Assistant Director one is mortgaged to theFrench to replace the late Mr. Tixier and the other has been promised to India.It is not proving easy to find for either a candidate who is both suitable and accept-able. It should be&apos; added that the Latin American countries have demandedrepresentation at the Assistant-Director level either in one of the existing postsor by the creation of a new post (see below).A considerable factor in the efficiency and economy with which the Office isrun is undoubtedly the control exercised by the governing body, which consists ofsixteen representatives of Governments, eight employers and eight workers.   This
control is exercised reasonably and is not so detailed as to interfere with theproper discretion and responsibility of the Director-General (and not so detailedas some of the employer members would wish); but it has the effect of keeping theadministration constantly on its toes, since the latter is liable at any time to becalled upon for explanations of its acts. Thus the governing body has asked its staff Questions Committee to report in consultation with the Director-General onthe organisation of the Office; and it has also asked the same Committee to considerthe general principles of recruitment including the geographical basis of recruitment. In short the governing body exercises a real but not crampinginterest in the administration of the organisation.APPENDIX II TO REPORT a food AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATIONOrganisation and Staffing1. Sir John Boyd Orr, the Director-General, was appointed in October 1945for two years. He will not serve after October 19-17. His personality and energy,however embarrassing it may have been to particular Governments, have put&quot; FA.O.&quot; on the map. His enthusiasm has communicated itself to his staff and there is no sense of frustration or lack of leadership. On the other handSir John Orr is no administrator and the internal organisation of F.A.O., after18 months, is still far from equipped and planned to carry out a coherentprogramme of work. Infected by the Director-GeneraEs predilection forConferences the senior staff has been engaged in the feverish preparation for thenext Conference rather than the carrying out of an orderly programme of work.2. The two senior assistants to Sir John Orr are F. L. McDougall(Australian) and S. L. Louwes (Dutch). The former is no administrator : he is ahot gospeller after the Director-Generaks own heart. The latter has proved adisappointment. He is probably an excellent executive for a piece of workalready planned, rather than a high ranking administrator. Although the con-stitution provides for the appointment of three Deputy Directors. Sir John Orrhas wisely appointed neither of his senior assistants to that rank.3. Below these positions are the heads of the technical divisions of F.A.O.(Nutrition, Agriculture, Statistics, Economics, Fisheries, Forestry, Information).Most of these have been appointed within the last year. None of them are drawn from the United Kingdom, although Dr. Aykroyd is an Englishman recruitedby E.A.O. from the Indian Service. No head of the Agricultural Division has yet been appointed. The heads of Division have only recently been recruitingstaff and have not yet organised their Divisions.4. There is no Administrative head, although M. Veillen-Lavallee (France)has been appointed as Senior Administrative Officer. He has, however, neitherthe experience nor the personality to create a team spirit amongst the seniorpersonnel and weld the different Divisions into a whole.5. The immediate problem is to decide upon Sir John Orr&apos;s successor. Itis not proposed to appoint another United Kingdom nominee. An Americanor a European has been suggested, but no names of any value have yet beencanvassed. If the new Director-General is anything like Sir John Orr in character a prophet and enthusiast rather than an administrator, then an experienced administrator should be appointed as senior Deputy Director-general as soon as possible. Sir John Orr himself favours the appointment of an american Director-General and a United Kingdom Deputy Director-General with&quot; Whitehall&quot; experience. When Sir John Orr leaves F.A.O. there will be noUnited Kingdom representative in a senior position in the organisation. Thiswill be very unfortunate, having in mind the many fields in which F.A.O.&apos;activities can directly affect the policies and activities of this country.6. In the technical sections of F.A.O. a number of competent individualshave been appointed, but there are no outstanding names. There has been atendency to select the &quot;long-haired&quot; enthusiasts rather than those withestablished reputations or practical executive experience. It is well to have insuch an organisation creative thinkers.   Without them the spirit would perish.
But their thinking must be converted into practical work and that work carried toa conclusion.   F.A.O. is weak in this field.7. At the beginning of the year the staff of F.A.O. was 160. It is expectedto reach about 650. The present is the time to weld it into a more compact andcoherent organisation and ensure that a programme of &quot;bread and butter&quot;activities of value to the nations of the world is laid down and put into operation.So far too many Conferences have been held. The countries of the world cannotservice all the Conferences being called. F.A.O. should for a time develop itsinternal organisation. A further extension of its external activities may resultin such diffusion of interest and activities that it will have no real achievementsto show as proof of its work and the expenditure of its by no means insignificantbudget.8. A separate F.A.O. office in Europe is at present being set up in Romeunder Dr. S. L. Louwes. There is danger that it may become an autonomouscompetitor of F.A.O. unless close liaison is established. This danger will beincreased if the headquarters of F.A.O. remain in the United States. Moreover,owing to the heavy expenses of the headquarters of F.A.O. in Washingtonthere are unlikely to be sufficient funds available to provide an expensiveEuropean office and organisation such as Dr. Louwes contemplates withoutreducing the effectiveness of F.A.O. headquarters. If F.A.O. headquarterswere in Geneva (or elsewhere in Europe) no separate European office would becalled for and if an American Regional Office were desired it would be a farless ambitious undertaking than the Regional Office suited to Europe.Ministry of Food,7th March, 1947.APPENDIX III TO REPORT AINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.   INTERNATIONAL BANK for reconstruction AND development organisation and StaffingIt is too early to express a useful opinion on the organisation and staffingof these two bodies. There is one very important difference between them and theother specialised agencies in that the twelve executive directors of each body and their alternates, who are appointed by members, sit permanently and take an active part in working the two institutions. They thus perform part of thefunctions which are carried out elsewhere by the senior staffs.The Managing Director of the Fund, who is chief of the operating staff, isM. Camille Gutt, who was Minister of Finance in Belgium. The head of theOperations Division is Mr. J. Fisher, who came from the Bank of England.Mr. John J. McCloy has recently been appointed President of the Bank after along interregnum. He was formerly United States Assistant Secretary for Warand has considerable Wail Street experience. His appointment will doubtlessbring changes in the staff of the Fund.Both staffs are being built up fairly slowly since the Bank has not yetagreed to make any loans and the Fund only opened for exchange operations on1st March.Treasury, S.W. 1,19th March, 1947.APPENDIX IV TO REPORT ANOTE ON THE U.N.E.S.C.O. SECRETARIATStaff1. U.N.E.S.C.O. took over the existing staff of the Preparatory Commissionwhen the latter ceased to exist in November 1946. This staff had been recruitedsomewhat at random by Sir Alfred Zimmern and subsequently by Dr. JulianHuxley, as Executive Secretary of the Commission. It included a larger british element than was justified on the basis of a proper geographical distribution, but
it was essential to take in people who happened to be available. The task of preparing for the first U.N.E.S.C.O. Conference and formulating the provisional programme for the Organisation was performed with reasonable efficiency, but thestaff was naturally, in the circumstances, somewhat unequal in quality andconspicuously weak in certain directions.2. The Conference in November and December approved the Director-General&apos;s proposals to continue the employment of the existing staff until the endof February; since then a large number of senior members have been dismissed.Those who remain, and any new recruits, are being engaged on very short-term contracts, 3 months being the usual period; none, except the Director-General andthe Deputy Director-General, has a contract for more than 1 year. Nominationsare to be invited from Member Governments and from the National Commissions,where they exist. The overhauling of the staff has been accompanied by somefriction and difficulty and this has inevitably interrupted the work of theOrganisation.3, It is obvious that the United States will claim a larger proportion of thetotal staff than it has had in the past. The appointment of the Director-general was the occasion of a tug-of-war between us and the Americans (the Frenchresigned their claim to the appointment when Paris was chosen as the seat of theOrganisation). The resulting compromise secured the post for Dr. Julian Huxleyfor 2 years only instead of the 6 years laid down in the Constitution. Theshortness of this term may be expected to give rise to a certain instability in the staffing and structure of the Organisation.Progress of the Work4. U.N.E.S.C.O. is at the very outset of its career and it is much too early to assess its effectiveness or to record any positive achievements. The programmeproposed by the Preparatory Commission was considerably reduced by theConference last November and will inevitably be reduced further, e.g., by budgetreductions, by the reorganisation of the staff, and by the pressure of circum-stances. U.N.E.S.C.O. covers such a very wide range of activities that it is liableto a certain dispersion of effort and any influence which we have should be exertedto secure concentration on a few major objectives.National Co-operation and United Kingdom National Committees5. The Constitution of U.N.E.S.C.O. differs from that of most other inter-national organisations in the somewhat elaborate arrangements laid clown forassociating with the Organisation, and with the Governments who are members ofit, the unofficial national bodies concerned in education, science and culture. Thework of organising national co-operation in this country is going steadily forward and is undoubtedly tapping much enthusiasm and goodwill.Invitations have been issued and the first meeting will shortly take place ofa United Kingdom National Committee consisting in the main of delegates to theConference.   Meetings have taken place of the following co-operating bodies :  Social Sciences : Chairman, Sir Charles Webster.Mass Media (Films, Radio and Press) : Chairman, Sir Henry French.Museums: Chairman, Sir John Forsdyke.Libraries : Chairman, Sir Henry Thomas.Natural Sciences : Chairman, Sir Robert Robinson.Arts : Chairman, Sir Ernest Pooley.The constitutions of the Co-operating Bodies have been worked out either by the unofficial organisations themselves and approved by us or by the ministry in consultation with the bodies concerned. The constitution of the EducationCo-operating Body was worked out by a committee of representatives of theprincipal organisations in the educational field, and the first meeting will beheld shortly. The body will include representatives of teachers in schools,technical institutions, training colleges and universities of Local EducationAuthorities, Youth Organisations and the Churches.Ministry of Education,nth March, 1947&apos;.[33384]c
APPENDIX V TO REPORT ANOTE   ON   THE   SECRETARIAT   OF   THE   PROVISIONALINTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANISATION(a) The organisation of P.I.C.A.O. is peculiar among Specialised Agenciesin that it has, in addition to a Secretary-General, a salaried President of Council.This fact, coupled with the personality of the present incumbent of the latteroffice, has tended to detract from the status of the former.The Liaison Officer, the Public Information Officer and Legal Counsel ofP.I.C.A.O. are in the Office of the President.The Secretary-General&apos;s office comprises three Bureaux, each under an assistant Secretary-General, namely, Air Navigation; Air Transport; and administration.   The first two are staffed largely by technical experts.The Air Navigation Bureau has ten sections, each concerned with a separatetechnical aspect of the subject. The Air Transport Bureau has three sections,dealing respectively with Legal Studies, Economics and Statistics, and SpecialProjects. The Bureau of Administration has twelve sections, each dealing withparticular administrative aspects.(b) After some initial teething troubles P.I.C.A.O. has settled down into an efficient organisation conceived on rather extravagant lines as the result ofprominent United States participation. It has been conducted with drive andvigour, thanks to the unremitting zeal of its salaried President and the experience in international affairs of its Secretary-General. Its activities have in fact tended to out-strip the administrative machinery of member States, which has beentaxed to keep abreast of the mass of technical recommendations which flowunceasingly from Montreal.(c) The pace has been too hot and the machine is beginning to take charge.The brake must be applied on P.I.C.A.O., not least in the interests of smallerStates who cannot cope with the present rapid succession of meetings.When its permanent successor, I.C.A.O., has become properly established the necessity for the Council to continue in permanent session in Montreal canbe reviewed, as a possible palliative.While the United Kingdom has had a reasonable share of higher appoint-ments, there is a tendency for political lobbying for posts. At United Kingdominstance, efforts are being made to eradicate this. The establishment of anall-embracing United Nations civil service would be a desirable solution.Ministry of Civil AviationSTATEMENT BY NATIONALITY OF SENIOR EXECUTIVEPERSONNEL OF UNITED NATIONS SECRETARIAT AS ATDECEMBER 1946APPENDIX VI TO REPORT a united States ..United KingdomFrance  ...Canada ...ChinaNorway ...Belgium ...Czechoslovakia ..Poland  ...NetherlandsDenmarkBrazilYugoslaviaAustraliaU.S.S.R.Greece   ...New Zealand   ..Mexico  ...SwitzerlandUkraine ...Egypt   .....India287101514537221818141612in8857552433CubaEcuador...UruguayChile    ......Haiti    ......Panama ...Dominican RepublicBolivia ...VenezuelaSweden ...IranAustria ...IraqSyriaByelorussian S.S.R.ArgentinaParaguayCosta RicaPhilippine RepublicNicaraguaSouth Africa432431222221111111111
REPORT BTHE  LOCATION  OF  INTERGOVERNMENTAL  ORGANISATIONS(Report of the Interdepartmental Working Party)1. At their meeting on 7th November, 1946 (CM. (46) 95th Conclusions) &quot; The Cabinet (2) Agreed that, in discussion of the location of the headquarters ofinternational organisations, His Majesty&apos;s Government should notadvocate the application of any general principle either decent-tralisation or centralisation at the site of the United Nationsitself.(3) Endorsed the view that the headquarters of the Universal PostalUnion and the International Telecommunications Union should remain at Berne.(4) Agreed that the headquarters of the International Trade Organisa-tion and the Food and Agriculture Organisation should be locatedtogether, and that it was undesirable that the headquarters ofthe former should be located in the United States.(5) Endorsed the view that, if a World Health Organisation were established, it would be undesirable that its headquarters shouldbe located in the United States.&quot;2. These statements of view by the Cabinet were given before the united nations had received and accepted the offer of a site in Manhattan (central new york) for the future headquarters. They were consequently based on the ideaprevalent at the time that the headquarters would be in a rural place somedistance from a large centre.3. Immediately after the Cabinet meeting referred to in paragraph 2 abovethere was telegraphic correspondence between the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary, who was then in New York, in the course of which the foreign secretary (New York telegram No. 1640 of 13th November) expressed the hopethat no final decision would be taken either on general policy or on particular cases until his return. In a telegraphic reply, dated 16th November, the Ministerof State informed Mr. Bevin that he thought the Cabinet would not proceed further until Mr. Bevin&apos;s return.4. The present moment is an opportune one for reviewing the question, sincethe permanent United Nations site has now been chosen and a number of specialised Agencies may feel it desirable to make up their minds about their headquarters very soon. The World Health Organisation may take some decision at its meeting beginning on 31st March; the Preparatory meetings of the Inter-national Trade Conference beginning in April and the summer meeting of theFood and Agriculture Organisation may well result, if not in final constitutionaldecisions, at least in recommendations which may be very hard subsequently to reverse. A further reason for an early review of the situation is that in new york the first steps are now being taken in designing the lay-out of united nations Headquarters. For planning purposes the Secretary-General and hisarchitectural advisers will need to have some idea relatively soon as to whatnumber of agencies will be likely to need space at headquarters.5. The question of the location of the Headquarters of the specialised agencies is neither a new nor a straightforward issue. In particular it is nolonger one of complete centralisation versus decentralisation. Completecentralisation is impossible, since the United Nations is located at New York,U.N.E.S.C.O. at Paris, the International Civil Aviation Organisation in montreal, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development andthe International Monetary Fund in Washington. There is little prospect of inducing any of these Organisations to move at all, and certainly not at an earlydate.6. There are, however, a number of Organisations which have not yet made up their minds. Among these are the International Labour Organisation, theFood and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation.Further, headquarters will have to be chosen for the proposed International trade organisation, the proposed International Shipping Organisation, and the Inter-national Refugee Organisation (which is limited by present Assembly resolution[33384]c 2
to Paris or Geneva). The question therefore is whether His Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent should adopt a definite policy in regard to the location of all these organisations as a group, and if so what that policy should be.Concentration versus Dispersal7. It is first necessary to determine whether there is any advantage in con-centration or whether each organisation should be dealt with in isolation. any policy which authorises or encourages dispersal has the initial disadvantage thatit invites the maximum of intrigue and &quot;log-rolling&quot; by individual countriesanxious for prestige purposes to obtain the headquarters of agencies in their national territory. Apart from this, a policy of concentration has a number ofpositive advantages. In brief, concentration makes co-ordination of both policyand administration between different agencies far easier. On the policy side,concentration brings with it the great advantage that the senior officials of eachOrganisation concerned can be in daily personal contact. Projects originatedby one Organisation which may seem to overlap the operations of anothercan be prevented or adapted without great difficulty before they have gone so far that it becomes out of the question to put them into reverse.This has particular importance in the case of Organisations such as the food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Trade Organisation whichhave many common interests. In general, concentration would be almost boundto lead to a habit of consultation and collaboration at the policy level in a manner and to an extent which would be physically impossible as between Organisationslocated thousands of miles apart.8. From the administrative point of view such concentration leads to greatlyincreased economy and efficiency through the maximum use by the United nations and the Specialised Agencies of common administrative and technical services,the easier development of an International Civil Service, &amp;c. We believe that from both points of view the advantages of concentration are such that an)-policy implying a possibility of dispersal has little ground; for support.Alternative Policies9. Given then that there is decisive advantage in concentrating, if possible,the agencies which have not yet decided on their permanent Headquarters, thefollowing appear to be the alternative policies open to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(a) Concentration of these organisations in New York.(b) Concentration elsewhere than in New York, the Economic and SocialDepartments of the United Nations remaining in New York.(c) Concentration elsewhere than in New York, the Economic and SocialDepartments of the United Nations Secretariat also being situatedon the chosen site.(a) Concentration in New York10. Concentration in New York means securing the greatest possible advan-tages from concentration as such. The Specialised Agencies concerned would bein the closest touch not only with each other but with the administrative head-quarters of the United Nations and great economies of time and man-power would undoubtedly ensue. There would be the further advantage that a majority ofthe conferences sponsored by the Agencies concerned would probably be held atthe combined Headquarters in New York, with the result that delegates to all such conferences would become accustomed to working not only in the atmosphere of their own Specialised Agency but in the wider atmosphere of the united nations as a whole.11. Concentration in New York would, also mean much greater proximity to the Bank and the Fund in Washington than concentration anywhere outsidethe United States.(b) Concentration of the Organisations only elsewhere than in New York12.   New York as a centre, however, presents certain disadvantages peculiar to itself. In the first place, in the United States an international organisation is directly exposed to the incessant operations of American commercial, politicaland other pressure groups, the strongest groups of their kind in the world. these operations do not always work out in the way intended, since often (particularly at conferences) the reaction is adverse. But in the opinion of the Departmentsconcerned with the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International
Trade Organisation, the effect of such lobbying is so bad that it is in the interestof His Majesty&apos;s Government and these two organisations themselves that theyas well as the proposed International Shipping Organisation should be locatedelsewhere than in the United States and preferably in Europe.13. There is also the objection against concentration at United Nations Head-quarters that New York is the most expensive possible place at which to locateinternational Organisations, and all the expenses have to be reckoned in the&quot; hardest &quot; of currencies. From this point of view almost any other Headquarterswould be preferable; from the same point of view there is clearly much to be said for the concentration of the Organisations with which we are chiefly concernedin this paper elsewhere than in New York, though the net financial gain mentionedin the preceding sentence is reduced somewhat by the increased cost of travellingoccasioned by the necessity of frequent personal contact between members of theUnited Nations Secretariat and members of the staffs of the Organisations con-cerned, and by a probable if undefinable increase in local staffs all round. Therewould also be some loss of the United Nations atmosphere referred to in para. 10above.(c) Concentration of the Organisations and the U.N. Economic and social Secretariat elsewhere than in New York14. It is clear, however, that one of the strongest objections to concentrationaway from New York of the Organisations concerned is the implied divorce fromcontact with the day-to-day proceedings of the United Nations, particularly onthe Economic and Social side. This objection would be met if the main body of theUnited Nations Economic and Social Departments, including the assistant secretaries-General for Economic and Social Affairs, were located at the sameplace, away from New York, as the Specialised Agencies in question. It wouldbe necessary for the United Nations to maintain nuclear offices under these departments in New York for the purpose partly of contact with the Bank andFund; but there seems no decisive political or constitutional reason why the mainwork of these Departments should not be done at some other centre. Meetingsof the Economic and Social Council would normally be held at this other centre,though any session held immediately before the General Assembly would probably have to be held in New York. It would be hoped that such an arrangement mightattract the World Health Organisation to choose the same place for its headquarters.15. The great disadvantage of this arrangement would be that it wouldinvolve a virtual division of the United Nations into two parts with grave riskof misunderstanding and division of authority between the Secretary-General andthe (Economic and Social) Deputy that he would have to appoint. This is a disadvantage unique to this particular plan.Location of Agencies under Plans (b) and (c)16. It has been mentioned above (paragraph 12) that the Departments ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government concerned with F.A.O. and I.T.O. would like to see the headquarters of these organisations somewhere other than in the United Statesand preferably in Europe. Indeed, both on grounds of facilities which it can offer and proximity to the work that has immediately to be done, Europe seemsto possess the greatest advantages. In Europe the best city is almost certainlyGeneva. The immediately post-war prejudice against that city as a symbol of failure has evaporated. There is now general acknowledgment among Govern-ments of its suitability, both politically and administratively, as a location for the headquarters of international Organisations; it is one of the few cities wherethere would be no immediate necessity for rapid building operations or for turningpeople out of offices and other buildings. Moreover, it escapes the political objections which must attach to the capital cities of any country, and particularly of any large country. Apart from its advantages vis-a-vis other European citiestherefore, Geneva offers advantages over and above most cities anywhere in theworld.17. One advantage should be mentioned at this stage which Geneva shareswith the rest of Western Europe, that of accessibility. The majority of nationslie nearer to Western Europe than to New York. The United Kingdom, inparticular, should almost always be able to send a good team to a meeting in geneva or elsewhere in Western Europe, whereas the availability of people for the journey to New York is not always so certain. Since without undue immodestyit may be claimed that the United Kingdom contribution has a great deal to do
with the success or otherwise of a conference, it is to that extent in the general interest that the United Kingdom should be in the position to send the best possible team.Conclusions18.-(i) The essence of the immediate problem is whether the specialised agencies which have not yet chosen their Headquarters, particularly the I.L.O.,F.A.O. and I.T.O., should be encouraged to concentrate in one place, and if so,whether that place should be New York or elsewhere.(ii) The Working Party agreed that the concentration of these Agencies wasin principle desirable.(iii) The Working Party likewise agreed that, if the three Agencies men-tioned in paragraph (i) above decided to concentrate in some place other than in new York, it would be most desirable for the Economic and Social departments of the United Nations Secretariat also to be located in that place. They further agreed that in these circumstances Geneva would be the most suitable site.(iv) The Working Party was not able, however, to agree on a recommendation to Ministers as between the three possible forms of concentration discussed in this paper. Some members thought that the advantages of concentration generally as described in paragraphs 7 and 8 combined with the advanta ges of New York as described in paragraphs 10 and 11 were so overwhelming that objections toconcentration in New York must be dismissed as secondary and inconclusive.Other members, while subscribing to the idea of concentration, felt that theinterests of the Organisations themselves should not be prejudiced by tooinsistent adherence to a formal principle. There was a further difference of emphasis which emerged during the discussion; for the Departments concernedwith the F.A.O. and the I.T.O. (and the proposed Shipping Organisation) itappeared that the most important objective was to settle outside the UnitedStates on grounds both of avoidance of local political pressures and excessive costs in hard currency : to the Departments primarily concerned with the I.L.O., on theother hand, the most important factor seemed to be close association with theEconomic and Social Council.(v) The question thus analysed is accordingly submitted to Ministers forconsideration and decision.
REPORT GREPORT OF THE WORKING PARTY ON international organisations AND THEIR CO-ORDINATIONOn the 22nd July, 1946, the Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary &quot;toarrange for a report to be prepared showing the number and scope of inter-national organisations now in existence or proposed, and indicating what steps could be taken to co-ordinate their activities and promote efficient working.&quot;2. Since that time international organisation matters generally have beenin a state of constant flux. Proposals have been made for the setting up of neworganisations, the Economic and Social Council and the Assembly have been engaged in the preparation and scrutiny of agreements between specialised agencies and the United Nations, and it is only recently that the picture hasbecome more clear. Further, the recent General Assembly has given delegates and officials an opportunity to study at first hand the working of the United NationsSecretariat and the mutual relationships between that Secretariat and the Secre-tariats of other intergovernmental organisations. The working of the united nations Secretariat has been discussed in detail in a separate paper submittedby their Working Party and this paper deals exclusively with the variousorganisations themselves and their mutual relationships.3. A list of the organs of the United Nations is given in Appendix I.Appendix II contains a list of existing and prospective Specialist Agencies anda brief note on the scope and function of each together with a definition of the term &quot;Specialised Agency.&quot; The United Kingdom is a member of all the organisations listed.Possibilities of overlapping4. In the security field there is little danger of overlapping provided thata satisfactory and efficient distinction is maintained between the work of the atomic Energy Commission on the one hand, and that of the Commission on-Conventional Armaments on the other. There should be no confusion as thetwo Commissions are likely to meet side by side in New York and a number of countries may well have the same representative on each Commission.5. In the economic and social field, however, the situation is very much more complicated.   The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has ninetechnical commissions and some of these commissions have, or may set up, sub-commissions amounting to another half-dozen.   Counting U.N.R.R.A. as defunctand the International Refugee organisation as temporary, there are seven* per-manent Specialised Agencies in existence already.  The Provisional InternationalCivil Aviation Organisation will drop the &quot; Provisional&quot; at any moment; thereare a World Health Organisation and an International Trade Organisation in immediate prospect and there may shortly be a new agency in the field of shipping.This makes eleven in all.   The possibilities of overlapping and confusion towhich this situation gives rise are clearly manifold.   For instance, there are obvious dangers that the Social Commission of the Economic and Social council may claim work belonging to the International Labour Organisation and theWorld Health Organisation, and, indeed, already shows signs in its recent Reportof making such claims.   Again, the terms of reference of U.N.E.S.C.O. are very wide and much patient and clear-headed planning will be necessary in orderto keep its work and that of, for instance, the Freedom of Information Sub-Com-mission of the Human Rights Commission into their own channels.   The respon-sibility for preventing confusion lies primarily with Governments (since all these organisations are inter -governmental) and secondarily on the Secretariats of theUnited Nations and the Specialised Agencies.   Governments have the responsi-bility of ensuring both that their own machinery for co-ordination is in goodworking order, so that the different representatives of a particular Member state to the different organisations will speak and act in the same sense, and that the organisations themselves keep each other properly informed and exercise thenecessary combination of enterprise and restraint in relation to each other in* International Labour Organisation, Food and Agriculture Organisation, international bank for Eeconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, United nations educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, International Telecommunications Union,Universal Postal Union.   See Appendix II.
the work they do. In short, there must be both goodwill and good machinery in order that the apparatus may function properly. It is too early yet to say whatthe omens are. Considering the great dangers of confusion we have not madetoo bad a start, but there is plenty of room for improvement.Possible Improvements6. This section contains a number of recommendations for bringing abouta greater measure of both national and international co-ordination than isassured at present.(A) United Kingdom(i) The I.O.C. CommitteeEvery effort is being made to increase the effectiveness of the Steering Com-mittee on International Organisations (I.O.C. Committee) as a Committee forthe review and co-ordination of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, in the Economic and Social Council, and in regard (toSpecialised Agencies and non-Governmental Organisations. Departments haverecently been requested to furnish to the Committee reports on all international conferences both within their own competence and within the Committee&apos;general competence as they occur.(ii) Working parties the I.O.C. Committee use and will extend the practice of setting up working parties for the preparation of drafts and papers, detailed work on which doesnot need the presence of the whole Committee.(iii) Other Inter-departmental CommitteesDepartments primarily concerned with work on the Specialised Agencies willcontinue to make extensive use of the system of special inter-departamental committees keeping the I.O.C. Committee informed of general lines of policy.(B) International(i) Economic and Social council the Economic and Social Council has not yet entered fully upon its role asa co-ordinating body which includes an undertaking &quot; to make recommendationsconcerning ways and means of improving relations between these bodies&quot; (i.e.,United Nations organs and Specialised Agencies; document E/231). This rolewill develop as the efficiency of the Council and the Secretariat develops, and asthe new agencies expand their activities. United Kingdom representatives onthe Council should take the initiative at all times in pressing the Council toexercise its co-ordinating functions in an appropriate and effective manner andshould in particular draw attention to any concrete cases in which this has notoccurred. In doing so the Council should pay due regard to the autonomy ofthe Specialised Agencies as recognised in their agreements with the united nations.(ii) Commissions of the Economic and Social CouncilCommissions of the Economic and Social Council whose fields of interestnecessarily overlap to some extent the interests of the Specialised Agencies shouldbe required to exercise their functions with a proper respect for the status and functions of the Specialised Agencies concerned. Commissions should bear inmind that their primary duty is to advise the Economic and Social Council,and that in most cases the exercise of co-ordinating functions will mean advising the Council of overlapping or inefficiency rather than making direct approaches to Specialised Agencies or performing work which is proper to specialised agencies. The United Kingdom representatives on Commissions should takethe initiative in ensuring that the Commission proceed in this manner.(iii) Agreements between the United Nations and the Specialised AgenciesExperience has already shown that the conclusion of formal agreements between the United Nations on the one hand and certain Specialised Agencies(International Labour Organisation, United Nations Educational, Scientific and cultural Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and ProvisionalInternational Civil Aviation Organisation) make co-operation easier and morenatural than a mere informal relationship.   For instance at the recent meeting
of the Co-ordinating Committee of top officials of the United Nations and thevarious agencies, the agencies with formal agreements enjoyed full participation,whereas those with no such agreements were only represented by observers. Whilethe Co-ordinating Committee set up by the Economic and&apos; Social Council isintended to co-ordinate machinery rather than policy, and while there arefriendly informal relationships with the organisations which have not concludedagreements, it would clearly make for easier and more natural working if the agencies which have not yet concluded or made preparations to negotiate agree-ments could do so. This applies despite their special characteristics to the bank and the Fund.Apart from anything else it should be remembered that the Charter doesnot simply permit or encourage these agreements, it enjoins them. Article 57reads in part &quot;the various specialised agencies .... shall be brought intorelationship with the United Nations . . . .&quot; Agreements between agencies suchas the recent agreement between the International Labour Organisation and theFood and Agriculture Organisation should also be encouraged.(iv) Concentration of A genciesCloser relationship between the agencies themselves and between the agencies and the Economic and Social Council is most desirable. In this connexion thereis no doubt that, from the exclusive point of view of co-ordination, the greater the extent to which the agencies and the Economic and Social Council establishtheir headquarters in the same place the better the result. The question oflocation has been discussed in detail in a separate paper submitted by thisWorking Party.(v) Merging of organisations the Economic and Social Council and the Specialised Agencies should be encouraged to proceed in the following manner in regard to the integration ofexisting organisations :  (a) Regional Bodies. The United Nations and the Specialised Agenciesshould, as far as possible, absorb regional or local agencies dealingwith the same subjects. For instance, the proposed Economic Corn-mission for Europe should absorb the work of the various Europeaninter-Governmental bodies dealing with economic, transport and other european matters. The Interim Commission of the World health organisation has, in the same spirit, been trying to bring about anintegration into the World Health Organisation of the Pan-AmericanSanitary Bureau, and have made fair progress despite some stronglocal resistance on behalf of what is a relatively old and well established body.Where the United Nations has a Regional Office, such as theEuropean Office at Geneva, the Specialised Agencies might considerwhether they can use these Regional Offices as their local agents, or at any rate make use of their technical facilities. The possibilitiesof combined public relations facilities should also be studied.(b) Functional. The United Nations and the Specialised Agencies shouldabsorb agencies dealing with part only of a subject dealt with as a,whole by the Economic and Social Council, or the Agency concerned.As a successful example of this, the Food and Agriculture Organisa-tion has taken over the Rome Institute of Agriculture. Anotherexample was the start made by the Social Commission of the Economicand Social Council in the direction of taking over the work of the penal and Penitentiary Commission; this process, however, wasfrustrated, partly by resistance on the part of the Penal andPenitentiary Commission and finally by the refusal of the SocialCommission to have dealings with a body of which Franco Spain isa member.Similarly, the amalgamation of inter-Governmental bodies carry-ing on the same kind of work should be encouraged; the EuropeanCentral Inland Transport Organisation or its successor, for instance,may be able to achieve more concentration of the organisations dealingwith European railways.His Majesty&apos;s Government should make a determined effort toget this situation tidied up.[33384] &apos;. &apos; T;
(vi) Priorities(a) general at present there is no proper machinery in the United Nations for deciding what work has priority. It is probably impossible to devise a completely unifiedauthoritative machinery within the United Nations framework which would bothimpose priorities and respect the autonomy of the Specialised Agencies. The bestexisting machinery is the Co-ordinating Committee of the top officials of theUnited Nations and the Specialised Agencies (see paragraph (iii) above). ThisCommittee reports to the Economic and Social Council which has a relativelywide mandate to co-ordinate (see paragraph (i) above); the Co-ordinating Coiri-mittee itself, however, being a body composed of officials and not of government representatives, has a strictly limited competence. It might, however, be possibleto strengthen the hand of the Co-ordinating Committee when discussingprogrammes for the forthcoming^ year if there could be some general acceptance by the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies of an order of priority for international operations of the general form : 11. First Priority.   Any action required to safeguard world security.2. Second Priority. Any action required to secure economic rehabilitation.3. Other desirable projects for which time could be found.The general acceptance of such a scale of priorities would make it much easier for the Economic and Social Council, the Specialised Agencies and theCo-ordinating Committee to insist that the various matters coming up for inter-national discussion should be handled in an order related to their urgency. Inassigning priority to a question for discussion, account would have to be taken not only of delegates and experts who would be concerned but also of theinterpreting and other technical facilities available internationally at any onemoment.(b) New OrganisationsSomething in the nature of the above criteria could be applied to all proposals to set up new Specialised Agencies or new Commissions and Sub-Commissions ofexisting organs of the United Nations. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom themselves may wish to let it be understood that they have now placeda moratorium on the number of agencies which they propose to join. HisMajesty&apos;s Government are pledged to join an International Refugee Organisa-tion, an International Shipping Organisation and, of course, the international trade Organisation; but fJhey do not, as at present advised, intend to join anymore new Organisations. (It might be desirable later to yield to strong pressure in favour of the setting up of an organisation to deal with housing and town planning, but the pressure does not seem to be irresistibly strong at present.)Governments should resist the temptation to multiply organisations, until at leastit is clear both that existing bodies are functioning satisfactorily and that thereis still something to be done internationally which cannot appropriately orefficiently be handled by some existing organisation.(c) ConferencesThere has been a tendency recently in certain organisations for officials tocall conferences at short notice, making it difficult for Governments to be properlyrepresented and for adequate work to be done. In general it is essential thatthis practice should be stopped and that no conference should be called for which provision has not been made in the budget of the organisation concerned. this cannot be made an absolutely rigid rule, since, for instance, the Security council could not possibly be bound rigidly by an annual budget which ruled out thepossibility of emergency meetings and journeys of special Commissions; this difficulty could be overcome by a number of expedients, for example, by including in the Security Council budget an item for unforeseen expenditure on activities ofthe nature in question. However, as a general rule conferences should not beheld unless they (i) have been authorised by some representative body and (ii) haveproper budgetary cover. The annual programme of conferences should be reviewed each year by the Co-ordinating Committee. Further, each agency shouldhave someone (equivalent to the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General forConference and General Services) whose duty it would be to watch all proposalsfor Conferences by all Organisations in case overlapping or waste of time shouldseem likely to develop out of any proposal.
(vii) Scrutiny&apos; and Co-ordination of Budgets \ ,The United Kingdom Representatives on the United Nations or on the specialised Agencies should watch for and report any instances of otiose orextravagant expenditure, with a view to enabling the member from the UnitedKingdom on the United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative andBudgetary Questions to take the matter up.Every encouragement should be given to the development of budgetaryco-ordination between the various Agencies and the United Nations. Suchco-ordination takes the form not only of exchange of information but also ofcommon financial practices and standardisation of methods. The review of administrative budgets of Specialised Agencies by the General Assembly, providedfor under the Charter, gives an opportunity to obtain a proper overall picture ofinternational activity and expenditure, and this review will be carried out for thefirst time next September. In the longer run it may prove possible and desirable,though this is more debatable, for a comprehensive budget, covering the united nations and some of the Specialised Agencies, to be submitted to the general assembly. It is understood that the Co-ordinating Committee at a recent meetingmade useful progress on this subject.(viii) Common Administrative PracticesSo far as possible agencies should have similar terms of service for their staffs and the comparable scales of remuneration, sub j ect only to variations in respect oflocal costs of living. There should also be flexibility in the interchange ofunspecialised personnel. This will not only ease the problem of supply and demand for staff between the Organisations, but will also in time produce anumber of international officials who will know the problems of the differentorganisations from inside, and will be able to assist by their knowledge of severalin the co-ordination of all. The widest use of common services (travel arrange-ments, interpreters, &amp;c.) should be encouraged.(ix) International Civil Service commission the United Kingdom Delegation at the Assembly and elsewhere shouldcontinue to press for the setting up of an international civil service commission with the ultimate object of increasing efficiency and decreasing nepotism in the recruitment of international staff.General : Role of the United kingdom. It is inevitable that international institutions should develop untidily.The personality of the first Secretary-General or Director-General, the relativeknowledge and persistence of individual national delegates, and the extent towhich politics intrude at the expert level at the expense of technical discussion,all contribute to the success or failure of an organisation, and to its efficientco-ordination with other organisations. In these circumstances the best course for the United Kingdom is to keep its own machinery as efficient as possible andto fulfil as far as it can with such influence as it commands the unpopular but important role of keeping the various organisations on their proper tracks. Itcan do this not only by skilful, handling of the business of meetings, but also bypatient and persistent work with other Delegations before the opening of con-ferences and between meetings. Close co-operation with other CommonwealthDelegations is axiomatic. Influence which can be brought to bear upon theUnited States Delegation is particularly important. In matters of first-class importance, early preparation of United Kingdom policy and diplomatic prepara-tion by advance approaches to other Governments play an important part.Mo reover, the machinery of diplomatic discussion with other Governments can beused with profit between meetings, particularly for the purpose of ensuring that governments take a continuous interest in and effective responsibility for theproceedings of the bodies of which they are members.8. The general exercise by United Kingdom Delegations of a sobering role in international organisations can always be carried out constructively and doesnot debar us from putting forward far-reaching and imaginative proposals. Itis bound, however, to lead from time to time to clashes with those whose ideas,though grandiose and inspiring at first sight, turn out to be ill-digested andimpracticable. Our best course is undoubtedly to continue to appoint to thevarious organisations representatives of the highest quality who can make their[33384] b- 2
influence tell by the merit of their work. By continuing to do this we shall alsocontinue to have an influence not only with other delegations but also with the secretariat, at any rate at the technical level, which will to some extent counteract the immense influence based on sheer power exercised by the United States andthe Soviet Union. While we shall have failures and disappointments, we have agreat responsibility to carry on the unobtrusive but effective work which has beendone in the early stages of the United Nations and the other organisations by united Kingdom delegates and representatives.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS(A) United Kingdom9. (i) Every effort should be made to strengthen the existent interdepart-mental machinery of Committee and Working Parties so as to ensure that instructions to United Kingdom Delegations to all international meetings are co-ordinated and consistent.(ii) United Kingdom Delegations should seek to play a leading, constructiveand common sense role in all international discussions. United Kingdom repre-sentation should be of the highest quality. 0(B) International(i) Economic and Social council the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations should develop itsrole as a co-ordinating body in international economic and social matters with due regard to the autonomy of the Specialised Agencies. It should not embark upon activities which are proper to the Specialised Agencies.(ii) The Commissions of the Economic and Social council the Commissions should exercise any co-ordinating functions proper tothem by advising the Economic and Social Council, again with due respect for theautonomy of the Specialised Agencies and should be required not to embark uponactivities which are proper to these Agencies.(iii) Agreements between the United Nations and the Specialised AgenciesThe Specialised Agencies which have not yet entered into formal agreementwith the United Nations should do so as soon as possible. The Agencies shouldalso be encouraged to enter into agreements amongst themselves with a view toco-ordination and co-operation.(iv) Concentration of OrganisationsConcentration of Organisations in the same place is a great advantage forthe purpose of co-ordination.(v) Merging of OrganisationsEvery effort should be made to merge international organisations handling the same or very similar questions.(vi) PrioritiesThe Economic and Social Council should as far as possible ensure that international work on questions within its scope should be undertaken in anorder of priority which puts first things first. This applies particularly to the holding of conferences and the setting up of new organisations. Conferencesshould, in general, be permitted only if they have been authorised by some repre-sentative body and have proper budgetary cover.(vii) Scrutiny and Co-ordination of BudgetsThe budgets of all organisations should be watched for any cases ofextravagant expenditure, and every effort should be made to ensure that theUnited Nations Assembly receives a comprehensive picture of the whole of inter-national expenditure each year.
APPENDIX I TO REPORT CList of the Principal Organs of the United nations the General AssemblyConsists of representatives of the 55 United Nations. Meets once a year for about six weeks to two months.

However, Article 57 which lays down thatspecialised agencies shall be brought into relationship with the United Nationsgives a description of such agencies which serve as a guide to the meaning of the term.   The passage reads as follows : &quot; The various Specialised Agencies, established by intergovernmentalagreement and having wide international responsibilities, as defined in their basic instruments, in economic, social, cultural, educational, health and related fields shall be brought into relationship with the United Nations. ...&quot;This Article, in effect, debars from the classification &quot; Specialised Agency &quot;all non-governmental organisations and all organisations which have purely local or otherwise restricted international responsibility. The position of importantorganisations set up for important temporary specific purposes (such as u..N.R.R.A., the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency, the proposed InternationalRefugees Organisation and the International Emergency Food Council) is lessclear, but consideration in this paper is confined to permanent organisationsfalling within the above definition.
