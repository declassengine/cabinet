THIS  DOCUMENT   IS THE   PROPERTY  OF   tUS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY*S   GOVERNMENT&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1947Copy No. 31CABINETTHE &quot;&quot;NUMBERS AND COST OF THE  CIVIL  service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I have for some time been very seriously disturbed at the total numbers and cost of the Civil Service. Making all allowances for important new develop-ments, which require new staff, I do not believe that the present numbers,particularly in certain old established Departments, can be justified.I give details, Department by Department, in an Appendix. In the totalthere were 397,570 Civil Servants on 1st April. 1989. and 722.294 on 1st January.1947. The wage bill for the Civil Service rose from  89,223,000 in 1938-39to  240 million in 1946-47. I draw attention, in particular to the heavy increases in the three Service Departments, especially in view of the fact that the Ministryof Supply, with its very substantial present numbers, has taken over a large partof the work done, before the war, by the War Office and Air Ministry. In 1939we were expanding the Armed Forces under the shadow of the German menace.To-day we are supposed to be enjoying the fruits of victory! But there is no sign in the figures of this fortunate change in our affairs. Quite the contrary]I cannot accept, as the last word, the very negative conclusions of the Report ofthe Civil Service Man-Power Committee. OP. (47) 121, and I must urge uponmy colleagues that further efforts be made to reduce without damage to theessential policies which we are carrying out this heavy, and publicly indefensible,overhead charge on the economic life of the nation. It should, of course, be under-stood that the figures I have given do not include the staffs either of the PublicBoards or of Local Authorities.2. Moreover, we are now confronted with a series of pay claims from theCivil Service, as follows :  (a) Clerical Pay Claims. The Staff Associations have for some time been pressing a pay claim on behalf of clerical and allied grades numbering270,000. The claim presented would cost rather over  6 million ayear. I am advised that we should try- to negotiate a settlementcosting about  3 million, and that there is a reasonable chance that,if this claim went to arbitration, the award might be roughly of this magnitude.(b) Extra Pay for not going back to rpre-%var hours. I find, with somesurprise, that Civil Service hours before the war were only for themain administrative, executive and clerical grades 38^ hours inLondon and 44 hours in the Provinces. Included in these hours was an official break of three-quarters of an hour for lunch. We are bound as a result of the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act by a war-time pledge to restore these pre-war hours by the beginningof next year, unless we can obtain agreement not to do so. The staff associations are asking either for a return to the pre-war hours, orfor some monetary compensation for continuing to work the presenthours of 45-1, both in London and the Provinces. The lower gradesare now paid overtime in excess of 42 hours in London and 44 hours in the Provinces. The middle and higher grades are not paid overtime.I am advised that we might get agreement, on the continuanceof the present hours, if we paid an extra duty allowance to the middlegrades. The cost of this might be about  2^ million a year, affecting100,000 persons. None of these would be covered by the clerical payclaim.SECRETCP. (47) 150lbth May, 1947[33028]
(c) Equal Pay. We have also been under pressure for some time to agreeto &quot;&apos; the principle of equal pay,&quot; i.e., to raising women&apos;s wages and salaries to equality with men&apos;s. The cost of this, in the Civil Servicealone, at its present inflated level, would be not less than  10 million a year. On top of this would come, of course, claims for &quot; equal pay,&quot;which could not be resisted, for teachers and Local Government staffs.The additional animal cost of these extensions would be some 20 million, of which the Exchequer, under present arrangements,would automatically bear at least half, ana would undoubtedly beheavily pressed to bear the whole.It is also pretty clear that, as soon as unmarried women are paid the same as married men, the latter will press for increased family allowances to be paid by the taxpayer. The cost of this might wellrange up to an additional  10 million a year.3. I am most reluctant to agree to any increase at this stage in the total costof the Civil Service. My broad conclusion is that we should seek to meet claims(a) and (6) above, but should resist claim (c). The merits of &quot; equal pay &quot; are,of course, being examined by a Committee under the Chairmanship of the minister without Portfolio. But whatever conclusion may be reached on the &quot; principles,&quot;we should, I think, reject the claim, for the present, on the financial ground thatthis is a most unsuitable time for a purely inflationary concession of this sort.We cannot, on this scale, pay more money for the same work. If, however, weare to give way on (a) and (&amp;), the cost of these must, in my view, be counter-balanced by reductions in the total number of Civil Servants. A cut of 5 per cent,in present numbers, i.e., of 38,000, would mean a saving to the taxpayer of about 12 million a year. This is a very modest target, and I propose that we shouldlay it down as the minimum to be achieved by the end of this calendar year.4.   I ask my colleagues to agree (i) to an effort to settle claims (a) and (b) in paragraph 2 as- thereproposed;(ii) to postponement, for the present, of any acceptance of claim (c) inparagraph 2;(iii) to a net reduction of present Civil Service numbers by at least36,000 by the end of this year, details to be discussed with theDepartments by the Civil Service Man-Power Committee and reported back to the Cabinet later.: H.
