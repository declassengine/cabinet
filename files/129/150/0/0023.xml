CONCORDEMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade.    I am directly concerned with three aspects of Concorde - british overseas Airways Corporation^ (boac&apos;s) requirements, exports and noise.These are not fully brought out in the papers I have so far seen.    Theyonly form part of the assessment on which our decision has to be madebut are none the less serious.boac&apos;s REQUIREMENTS2.    BOAC have analysed in detail the financial effects of operatingConcorde on the 5 major routes which they consider most suitable, includingLondon-New York.     They are very willing to fly supersonic aircraftprovided the operation is reasonably economic, or at least breaks even, andI have no doubt that BOAC have tried to make an honest and objectiveappraisal.     Their work suggests that even for a small network of 5 routes,which would require 5 aircraft, they would be considerably less well offwith a mixed fleet of Concordes and 747s than with an all-7V7 fleet,particularly in the initial years.    This is primarily because of thedifficulty of offsetting the very high operating costs of the Concordewith higher load factors and fares, except on the New York route wherebusiness traffic is dense.     They estimate a loss of between  1 million and  3 million per year per Concorde.    Thero must at this stage beassumptions in their work which could be open to argument but the available evidence certainly points to an overall worsening of their financialposition if they operate Concorde,1CP(70) 23 COPY NO21 July 1970CABINET
3.     In terms of the total market for Concorde, boac&apos;s work as It now stands would be consistent with an outcome right at the bottom end ofthe range of 50-150 sales put forward by the United Kingdom members ofthe Concorde Economic Prospects Committee.    Even if allowance is madefor the possibility that BOAC may have been unduly pessimistic it seems that the total market would not be greatly increased.    It looks thereforeas if both we and the French are faced with considerable losses in termsof Government expenditure.    As the Minister of Technology has pointed out,there would be sizeable foreign exchange earnings but only at a high cost in sterling.     Indeed if 50 aircraft were sold we would be exporting at an exchange rate of about $1 ,50 to the  1.4.    If Concorde is completed, BOAC are likely to seek a subsidy from theGovernment for operating it.    Though they are doing very well at present,they forecast a considerable downturn in profits over the next few yearslargely due to world over-capacity from the 7V7.    A subsidy might be givendirectly or it might take the form of a reduced target rate of returnj   in either case it would become known to other airlines and Governments andwould be likely to affect their attitude to purchases.NOISEAirport Noise5.     The use of Heathrow and J F Kennedy airports is vital to the initialcommercial success of Concorde.     Both airports insist on compliance witha limit on take-off noise which is monitored at various points in thevicinity of the airport j   their standards are much the same.    Even if the noise levels associated with the prototypes prove to be characteristic ofthe production model under full load and if improved silencers reduce noiseas much as is hoped, it seems probable that the compliance of the aircraft with Heathrow and Kennedy limits will be marginal.    The normal remedy of reducing payload or fuel is less open in the case of Concorde as both arecritical to the aircraft!s perfornance.6,     It is within our powers to adjust the limits at Heathrow to accommodateConcorde;   but it would be a most unpopular measure with those living near the airport especially as Concorde creates a very high level of lateral2
noise, which is not at present regulated.   The situation at Kennedy is different.    The Port of New York Authority is under no obligation ofnational interest to bend its rules in favour of Concorde and, in contrast with the law in the United Kingdom, it can be sued for nuisance.7.    By the time Concorde comes into airline service, a new generation ofsubsonic jet aircraft will have appeared.    They will be much quieter than their predecessors and Concorde will stand out in marked contrast to othernew types.    By 1974 or soon afterwards the pressure of public opinion maywell have brought about a reduction in take-off noise limits, and theintroduction of lateral noise limits, at Kennedy and other major airports.Noise Certification8,     The International Civil Aviation Organisation has undertaken the task of drawing up a noise certification scheme for supersonic transport aircraft.In addition the American authorities have announced their intention of introducing draft domestic regulations this year for the noise certificationof supersonic transport aircraft.    It is our intention to press forConcorde&apos;s exclusion from such schemes on the basis that it is an aircraft in an advanced state of design which should not be subject to anyretrospective noise design standards;   alternatively, we can argue that the initial standards should be designed to accommodate Concorde with atightening of standards for subsequent supersonic types.    Whether these arguments will be accepted internationally or by the Americans remains tobe seen.Supersonic Boom9.     In a White Paper issued in June the previous Administration made knowntheir view that commercial supersonic flights over the United Kingdom shouldbe banned for flights which cause the boom to be heard on the ground.    Therewere to be appropriate consultations before a final decision was made.    Weshall have to decide shortly, for air traffic control purposes, whether ornot to confirm this decision.    However, it has always been assumed thatthere would be a ban on supersonic flying over populated territories, sothis decision will not affect the assessment of Concorde&apos;s commercial prospects.    The United States has already introduced a draft &quot;rule&quot; banningcommercial overflying of the States (including Alaska) and other countries have announced their intention of taking similar action,MAC NBoard of Trade SW121 July 19703
