DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 5 COPY NO    *M29th June 1970CABINETNATIONAL DOCKS dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment and ProductivityAn official national dock strike, involving virtually all thecountry&apos;s 47,000 deckers, is threatened for Tuesday 14 July by theTransport and General Woxkers Union (TGWU) and other dockers&apos; unions.This is in support of their longstanding claim for an increase in thenational weekly time rate from the present  11. Is. 8d (fixed inJanuary 1966) plus  2 &quot;modernisation&quot; supplement (introduced ondecasualisation in September 1967) to an inclusive  20.2.     The National Association of Port Employers (NAPE) have consistently refused any increase in this basic rate    They argue thatany such increase would lead, with no offsetting improvement in productivity, to increases in average weekly earnings which (includingovertime, piecework and a variety of other payments) are already well over  35 (having increased by 57 per cent since January 1966).    more over it would perpetuate this obviously absurd pay structure.3.     The NAPE take the view that any basic improvement in dockers&apos; pay should be sought in the current port-level &quot;Devlin Stage 2&quot; negotiations.These are designed to replace all existing national and local pay settle-ments by a series of separate port agreements, providing new paystructures tailored to local needs.    In particular many ports are seeking to get away from the piecework system with its endless opportunities fordispute and escalation of earnings by ship-side bargaining.4.     In the London enclosed docks, for example, agreement has already-been reached with the TGWU (though not with the National AssociatedStevedores and Dockers&apos; union (NASD)) to abolish piecework in favour ofa fixed weekly wage of  34. 10s. ( 37 for men working on ships).Similar agreements have been reached in Southampton and some smallerports.    Negotiations are well advanced in all the other major portsexcept Liverpool where they have just started.    NAPE fear that any general increase in earnings through national negotiations at this juncture would prejudice these local negotiations, particularly the already slim chances inLondon of bringing the NASD into line with the TGWU.1
5.     While therefore standing firm on the basic rate, NAPE havewithin the last few days indicated privately to the unions willingness toincrease the weekly earnings guarantee, at present  16 ( 17 in London)to  20 (in all ports).    No man would go home with less than this amount,so removing any possible argument about low individual earnings concealedin average figures.    Since few earn less than this there would be little effect on average earnings and no danger to Devlin 2 negotiations.&apos;&apos; .6.      It is understood that the unions are unlikely to accept this offer evenas a basis for negotiation, but are at this stage still pressing for anincrease in the basic rate.    With the strike deadline still two weeks offthey may yet change their minds.    Moreover some of the employers arelikely to be in serious financial difficulties in the event of a strike andmight therefore initiate further efforts to reach a settlement.    There is,however, a serious risk that the strike will take place.7.      Whether or not there is trouble on a national scale, trouble inLondon seems inevitable within the next few weeks because of the refusal of the NASD to accept the agreement already reached with the TGWU.The London employers have now referred this issue to the NationalModernisation Committee (NMC), a body established by the two sides tooversee the Devlin negotiations, with an independent chairman(Mr Goowge Cattell) and vice-chairman (Mr. Tom Claro) appointedat their request by my predecessor, and serviced by the DEP.     The NMCwill probably meet to consider this towards the end of next week,    It isdifficult at this stage to see how they can resolve the issue withoutupsetting either the TGWU or the NASD.    In view of the long-term benefits to the employers of the productivity features of the agreement reached with the TGWU,, it is possible they will eventually improve themoney offered, so as to secure acceptance by the NASD,    But muchwill depend on the course of national negotiations meanwhile.8.     Officials of my Department are keeping in close touch with bothsides, both nationally  and in London, on an informal basis as well asthrough the secretariat of the NMC.    I do not propose any formal inter-venticc by the Government at this stage.    I shall keep those of mycolleagues who are principally concerned informed of developmentsR L department of Employment and Productivity SW I26th June 1970
