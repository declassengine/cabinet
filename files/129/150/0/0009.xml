; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT54CP(70) 9 COPY NO    u a3 July 1970CABINETMISUSE OF DRUGS bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. There is considerable public interest and concern about misuse of drugs and I am convinced that legislation on this subject should have a high priority in this Session.2. The previous Governments Misuse of Drugs Bill, which was half-way through the Commons Standing Committee when Parliament wasdissolved, was based on consultations with a wide range of professional,commercial and other interests and its broad principles and objectives were generally endorsed by all Parties,    YsTe, in opposition, put down a number of amendments to clarify points of detail and administrativeintention, most of which were withdrawn upon explanations being given.But our principal objectives were -i. To alter the predominant emphasis of the Bill on penalprocedures, in favour of a more balanced deployment of preventiveand social measures such as education, treatment, rehabilitationand research.ii. To remove from the Bill elaborate provision for control ofirresponsible prescribing, which, we argued, should properly bethe responsibility of the General Medical Council and otherprofessional bodies.A number of other controversial issues awaited discussion when theBill was lost - notably the proposed level of penalties, the questionwhether, as recommended by a majority in the report of a Sib*-Committeeof the Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence (of which Mr. Deedes wasChairman), police powers to stop and search suspected drug offendersbefore arrest should be maintained, the status of cannabis, and thepossibility of central monitoring of distribution and prescribing of drugs to detect new trends and suspicious activities.
3.        It is clear that the specific matters mentioned above require a gooddeal of further consideration and consultation before the case for revisionof the proposals in the Bill could be assessed.    I propose, with myinterested colleagues, to pursue those enquiries during the summer recess.    I shall v/ant to take account of the suggestions made in theBow Group report.    I am not at this stage sanguine that we shall beable to produce new proposals on every point or that on merit3 it willbe found right to do so.    Some of our proposals may be susceptible of administrative rather than legislative action.    These matters, however,are all of importance and a new Administration should be seen to havegiven them full consideration before it endorses all or any of the solutionsproposed in the previous Governments legislation,4.        In my view the question for decision now is whether to introduce the Misuse of Drugs Bill before the Summer Recess in its original form,or to defer introduction of a Bill until we have completed as much of ourreview as may be possible by the end of the autumn.    I strongly favour the first course because it will show the Governments intention to tackle the subject speedily, will give us further opportunity to take Parliamentaryopinion on the principles of the Bill, and will allow outside interests tofocus on specific propositions.    In introducing the Bill I would wish tomake clear that while the Government accepted the broad principles and objectives it reserved its position on subsidiary issues and its right, afterreview of the Reports of the Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence(Cannabis, Rehabilitatior, Amphetamines and LSD, Powers of Arrestand Search) and of other matters such as barbiturate misuse and compulsory treatment, to bring forward new proposals at the committee stage.5.        If this were accepted, I think it would be right to make no amend-ments to the Bill before introduction, a. because partial amendment would create uncertainty about our attitude to what was unamended,but b., and more important, because it would be impracticable, inany event, for the several Departments concerned jointly to prepare,and to consult outside interests upon amendments., even of a minorcharacter, in the time available before the summer adjournment.6.        I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree that the Misuseof Drugs Bill should be reintroduced now unamended, with a view toa Second Reading debate before the Recess.R m home Office SW13 July 1970
