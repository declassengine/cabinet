DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY:S government cp(70) 7 COPY NO   541 July 1970CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS situation memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment and ProductivitySince industrial strife is unfortunately almost certain to be a major feature of our life in the coming months and since the industrialclimate has changed so much since 1Q64, I thought it might be helpful to circulate this memorandum analysing the main features of the currentindustrial relations situation.    Major current disputes and those whichmay arise in the coming months are listed in the annex.     No attempt ismade in this memorandum to suggest measures for dealing with thesituation.    I shall be putting before my colleagues in due course proposalsfor a framework of legislation within which reform of our industrial relations system can be pursued,INCREASE IN DISPUTES2.     As the table below shows, there has been a marked downwardtrend for the last ten years (and in fact for considerably longer) in thenumber of strikes in coal-mining, matched by a fairly steady increasein the number of strikes in the rest of the economy.    Because of thesetwo opposite trends, the total number of strikes, while fluctuating fairlywidely, did not until recently show any consistent tendency to increase or decrease.     Since 1966, however, there has been a continuous increase.In 1967 and 1968 this was within the limits of previous year-to-yearfluctuations but in 1969 and early 1970 there was a marked accelerationin the rate of increase; the figure for 1969 (which was the highest on record) was 30 per cent over that for 1968, and the provisional figure forthe first 5 months of 1970 is 50 per cent over that for the correspondingperiod of 1969 (1876 compared with 1234).

The 1969 figure of working days lost, just over 6. 8 million, wasthe highest since 1957 when there was a loss of over 8. 4 million working days of which about 4 million were accounted for by a national strike in engineering.    In 1969* although nearly 1 million days were lost in the unofficial strike in coalmining in October, the high figure of working dayslost was due mainly to the increase in the number of strikes.4,     The provisional total number of working days lost during thefirst 5 months of 1970 - nearly 4 million - was the highest for the comparable period of any year since 1962, and w?s almost double the figure for the corresponding period of 1969.    Again it was more dueto the increase in the number of strikes than to the size of any one strike.5.     No figures are available to show the extent to which other formsof industrial action e. g. go slows, working to rule, overtime bans, etc.have been used, but it is safe to assume that resort to these forms ofindustrial action is also on the increase.6.     The strike problem is most serious in a small number ofindustries which account for a very large proportion of disputes and working days lost - for example in the docks, motor assembly and components and shipbuilding.     The increase in the number of strikeshas-, however, affected virtually all major industries.    Industries,services, or companies that were previously virtually strike-free are sono longer.    Doctors, teachers and other ?8*white-collar &quot; occupationshave taken or threatened major strike action for the first time.    It isalso noticeable that while the great majority of strikes are still of short duration, the long and difficult strike at company or plant level(e. g. Port Talbot, Pilkingtons, Ford, Standard Triumph) is becomingan increasing problem.(2
7.    As the Donovan Commission pointed out, negotiating arrangements and disputes procedures in much of British industry are in need ofoverhaul.     Although the Donovan Report gave an impetus to discussion ofthe need for reform, in practice relatively little real progress has beenmade.    The acknowledged defects of negotiating and disputes machinerydo not however provide an explanation of the marked increase in strikeslast year and this, and the Donovan Commission was clearly wrong in assuming that if proper machinery were established at company and plantlevel, the problem of unofficial and unconstitutional strikes would shortlydisappear.    Militancy has paid too well to be easily given up.    This isparticularly true in industries such as motor assembly and components,newspapers, and the docks where small groups of workers can exerciseimmediate and crippling industrial pressures and employers find it - atany rate in the short term - less expensive to make concessions thanresist.8.     The increase in militancy has been reflected in the high level ofsettlements.    During the last twelve months the average size of wage and salary settlement has been about 9 per cent.    (During the last sixmonths, it has been between 10 and 11 per cent).   Some of those industries which had big increases in summer and autumn last year are coming forward again for increases in the 1970-71 round.    The outcome ofthese negotiations will be crucial for the general level of increase in1970-71.MILITANT LEADERSHIP9.     While the deterioration in the situation cannot be wholly attributed to the growth of militant leadership in the unions, or by the previous administration^ defeat in the confrontation with the unions in 1969, thereis no doubt that these have reinforced the trend.    The present leaders ofthe two largest unions, the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU)and the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry workers (AEF)owe their position to the support of shop floor militants, and both are committed,  Mr. Jones of the TGWU more than Mr. Scanlon of the AEF,to pursue policies which will enable shop floor militants to make the running.    In the TGWU officials are appointed by the general secretary and Mr. Jones is appointing men who accept his views to key positions.In the Amalgamated Engineering Union (the engineering section of the AEFand the most powerful unit within it) power is more dispersed.    Theexecutive is split, but there is a majority of left-wingers.    The electeddistrict committees, often militant, enjoy virtual autonomy within their areas.    The AEF&apos;s current merger with two smaller unions, theConstructional Engineering Union and the Draughtsmen^ and AlliedTechnicians&apos; Association, which Stave strongly left-wing leaderships, willreinforce its militant trend.10.    Most of the &quot;second tier&quot; of large unions - the General and municipal Workers Union, the Electrical, Electronic and TelecommunicationsUnion/Plumbing Trade Union (the former etu), the National and LocalGovernment Officers Association, the Union of Shop Distributive and AlliedWorkers and the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, etc - have more moderate leadership, though in nearly all there are some militants inelected office nationally or locally.    In any event, because of the militant3
shop floor tactics pursued by the TGWU and the AEF, and the success withwhich they have been attended, the more moderate unions often find itnecessary for membership reasons to adopt militant tactics themselves,or at any rate to make no great effort to contain them if pursued on the shop floor by their members.11,    The growing awareness of power on the shop floor and the increasing part played in negotiations by shop stewards and other shopfloor representatives have disrupted established patterns of negotiations.It is not uncommon nowadays for strikes to occur with little or no notice and even before a formal claim has been lodged.    Established proceduresare widely ignored.    Claims are frequently ill defined.    Strikes called inthese circumstances are often run by unofficial committees withoutdefined powers or responsibilities, with membership subject to unforeseenchanges and sometimes set up in opposition to the recognised stewards.Such bodies are by their nature vulnerable to penetration by subversiveinfluences and it is difficult for moderate union leadership to assertcontrol over them, even if the will to do so were present.    The lack ofcohesion and negotiating expertise of these bodies and the fact that theyare not bound by defined responsibilities have been important factors in anumber of recent long and difficult strikes.    In recent years there hasbeen a considerable increase in the number of left-wing militants holdingposition of influence on union executives, and among full -time officials,and branch and workplace representatives,12.    Inter-union rivalries have sharpened in recent years, though they now centre mainly on membership and power I rivalries over jobdemarcation are less prominent.    The major unions whose membershiphas increased as a result of amalgamations and mergers are all virtuallygeneral unions, and are represented side by side in negotiating machineryat industry, company and plant level.    Competition for membershipcreates competition in militancy.    In the white-collar field outside thepublic sector trade union recognition is still relatively restricted andthere is a real danger that the extension of trade union organisation inthis field will give rise to serious conflicts between white-collar unionsproper such as the Association of Scientific, Technical and ManagerialStaffs and the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union, and the predominantly manual unions who are seeking to recoup themselves for theshrinking field of recruitment among manual employees by expandingmembership among white-collar workers.ROLE OF THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS (TUC)13,    The TUC concerned itself little with individual strikes prior to last year*s &quot;concordat&quot;, which committed the TUC to a more interventionistrole in inter-union disputes and major unconstitutional stoppages.Although Mr, Feather&apos;s personal activities and particularly the publicitygiven to them have given the impression that the TUC has made a determined attempt to honour its &quot;solemn and binding&quot; undertaking, thepractical results of the tuc&apos;s efforts have been limited.    TUC inter-vention has been useful in a number of inter-union disputes, but it has4
clearly felt unable to take a firm line where major unions have been involved.    It has in general been unable to deal with major unofficial strikes.    Where it has intervened, it has not attempted to do so by-pressing unions to take firm action, e. g. disciplinary measures, tosecure a return to work.    In such situations, the tendency has been forthe TUC to try to assume a conciliation role which, given the TUCsultimate loyalty to its constituent unions, has usually enabled it to shiftresponsibility for continuance of an unconstitutional stoppage to management, increased pressure for concessions by management tosecure a return to work, and caused occasional embarrassment to moderate unions following a strictly constitutional line.     Given thepower of the larger unions within the TUC, and the readiness with whichthey have allowed shop floor pressures to make the running, it is unrealistic to expect the TUC to attempt to play a more objective and constructive role.MANAGEMENT ATTITUDES14.     By and large managements now accept union organisation ofmanual and to a lesser degree of white-collar employees as a fact ofindustrial life.    Backwoodsmen determined to ignore the existence ofunions are rare.    The extensive damage which stoppages can cause isunderstood, and in serious disputes it is now common for decisions to betaken on the management side at very senior levels.    Few managementsare however equipped in terms of training and ability to handle withconsistency and skill the continuing industrial relations problems whichface them, and the difficulties of dispute situations are oftent compoundedby a previous history of ineffective management in industrial relationsmatters.    Inability to foresee and find a way through the industrial relations implications of managerial problems often severely restrictsthe capacity of managements to plan and implement necessary changes.There would be no harm either if managements demonstrated lessinfrequently that they have the ability to choose judiciously the groundthey will stand on, and the resolution to do so.Department of Employment and Productivity, SWl30 June 19705
CONFIDENTIALANNEXCURRENT MAJOR DISPUTES1.    The major printing unions have submitted substantial pay claims in generalprinting and provincial newspapers.   An improved offer - an increase of  3 15sin two yearly instalments - has been rejected,2.    An unofficial and unconstitutional strike in support of a  9 a week payclaim by 650 workers making die castings for the Lucas organisation has led to5,000 lay offs in other Lucas factories.   The company have so far offered about 3,   Prospects of a settlement seem remote.   If prolonged the strike will lead to substantial lay offs by the major motor manufacturers during the next week owingto shortage of electrical components.3.    At the British Steel Corporation, Corby, an unofficial and unconstitutionalstrike by 21 00 maintenance workers in support of a claim for increased bonuspayments has caused upwards of 4^000 production workers to be laid off and asubstantial cut in the production of steel tubes.   The BSC fear that any improvementin their offer of bonus increases of up to  3 will lead to consequential claims for production workers,4.    In the docks a national delegate conference held by the TGWU and other maindockers1 unions on 23 June called for a national dock strike from Tuesday, 14 July,unless there is further progress on their long-standing claim for the national timerate (for a 40 hour ?/eek) to be increased to  20 from the present  11 1 s 8dabsorbing the present ^modernisation&quot; supplement of  2 and overtaking the presentminimum earnings guarantee of  1 6 ( 17 in London).   The National Association of port Employers have consistently refused any general improvement in this nationalrate in view of the current port-level negotiations for a completely new pay structure under Devlin Stage 29 the level of average weekly earnings ( 35 13s 6dfor the first quarter of 1 970) and the fear that any significant increase wouldbe carried through into earnings, so raising the price for Devlin 2 generally andnegativing such agreements as have already been reached.   In the absence of adirect request by either party the DEP is not taking any public initiative, buttreating the matter as an issue between the parties at this stage.   It seems probable that the employers will offer some improvement - probably in theguarantee - but at present they claim to be determined to resist any sizeablegeneral improvement in earnings.
PROSPECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS5,    Most of the major claims which will be under negotiation in the coming months are in the public sector.   Doctors and dentists remuneration is the mostimmediate major issue, and the size of the increase given to this highly-paidprofessional group will undoubtedly influence the level of expections inother negotiations.6,    Claims for a 20 per cent increase (plus 10 per cent where no productivityschemes operate) are in for manual workers in local government (750,000 workers)and in National Health Service (250,000 workers).   The local government claimwill need to be settled in July/August.   A settlement in local government isinvariably followed by a settlement of the same size in the NHS.   The size ofthe local government settlement will be strongly influenced by a recentsettlement of around 1 5 per cent in the industrial civil service.7.    Teachers (England and Wales) are expected to submit a claim in the coming months for a very large increase to take effect from 1 January 1971 .8.    Settlements will also have to be reached in the next few months in anumber of the nationalised industries.   Negotiations in electricity supply will come to a head in the late summer.   The unions have already made it plain thatthey expect to get a settlement which will take account of a 1 5 per cent increase in the gas industry in Pebruary 1970 (as against 10 per cent for electricity supply last autumn).   A large claim is expected in coalminingand the negotiations will probably take place in the autumn.9. The negotiations between BOAC and BALPA over the latter &apos; s claim for verylarge increases for flying Boeing 747s are now likely to be held up because ofa split within BALPA.II10.    Craftsmen in the steel industry intend to make a claim for a 10 per cent increase in basic rates and other improvements despite the fact that theindustry&apos;s 3-year agreement does not expire until March 1972.11.    The two biggest agreements in the private sector - the national agreements in engineering and building are on a long-term basis and are not likely to bere-opened in 1970*   Probably the most important settlement in the private sector(luring the next two or three months will be for clerical workers in the
engineering industry (500,000 workers).   In addition to these industry-widenegotiations, increases in pay are likely to be sought through companynegotiations eg in the case of non-federated firms, and through plant and shopfloor negotiations on piece work and bonus payments.   Among the companynegotiations that involving Rootes, Coventry, In which a settlement in the range of 9 to 12 per cent has been reached in one plant is likely to influence the size of other settlements within the company and to set a target for negotiationselsewhere in the motor industry later in the year.12.    There is a serious risk of disruption of air services at London, Heathrowover firemen&apos;s pay and the operations of a ground handling services company,A committee of inquiry appointed by the previous administration will be reportingshortly on these disputes, and publication of the reports - that dealing withthe firemen&apos;s pay dispute should appear in about 10 days time and that dealingwith the ground handling services company 2 to 3 weeks later - may give rise to industrial unrest.confidential
