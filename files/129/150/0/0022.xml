GP(70) 22 COPT NO20 July 1 970CABINETAGRICULTURAL POLICY:   CHANGES IN SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and PoodOur declared agricultural policy has two associated objectives -a. to expand home production in the interests of import saving,which will he important if the negotiations to get into the common market come to nothing and probably even more so if they succeed; and b. to raise market prices by means of levies on imports, so thatdeficiency payments from the Exchequer are no longer necessary tosecure the home producers&apos; return.2.    We have always recognised that the introduction of levy arrangements on this basis will not be welcomed by overseas suppliers.   But we havealso recognised that there will be very substantial benefits to theExchequer both from savings on deficiency payments costs and from levyrevenue.   We have accepted that in order to secure these benefits weshall have to be prepared to take a firm line internationally.   We cannot expect to get them easily by agreement.   Our position on these issues wasmade plain during the Election.   The Prime Minister has previouslyput the Governments of New Zeland and Australia, as well as othergovernments in no doubt as to where we stood, and both Mr Godber and myselfhave taken every occasion open to us to reinforce our determination tocarry our policy through.3.     We must now decide how to set about implementing our policy.   Inthis memorandum, I have set out the main problems and I invite the agreementof my colleagues to the line of action to be followed.1
INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONSk-,     We are committed to talk to our major overseas suppliers before we make changes.   They will be expecting us to begin talks soon, and will ofcourse be expecting us to take a firm line.   Some will acknowledge theimportance to their own economies of a strong British economy, not under-mined by recurrent balance of payments difficulties, but they are not likelyto say so openly.   Our market, protected at present from dumped and subsidisedsupplies only to a limited exbent, remains attractive to supplying countries and they will certainly press us to keep the market open and to maintain their share of it.5.     As colleagues know there are the international obligs/bions, bothgeneral and specific, that limit our ability to introduce import controlsof a kind and at a time of our own choosing.   We shall have to get out ofthese if we are to adopt the comprehensive system of variable leviesforeshadowed in our manifesto over a three year changeover period.   Torealise the full potential benefit during the lifetime of this government, we would have to make a start very soon.e.c. NEGOTIATIONS6.     The opening of the negotiations has brought a new element into thesituation.   Although our proposals for variable levies are in many respectssimilar to the arrangements we should have to adopt on accession to theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.), there is a big difference in adoptingthem with the United Kingdom in isolation and with the United Kingdomnegotiating to join an enlarged European Community.   While the introductionof methods of support more akin to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) inprinciple would be welcome to the Six themselves, the imposition of levieson our imports from them would not.   But until we are actually members, itwould be hard to justify preferential treatment for them.   The position of denmark and the Irish Republic is especially difficult.   Our existing obligations to them are onerous enough:   but as fellow applicants to join the e.c. they are bound to resist strongly the application of levies ontheir trade at a time when they are looking forward to improved access inan enlarged Community, including the United Kingdom.   Thus it is clear thatthere would be great difficulties in conducting negotiations for introducing a comprehensive levy system on the basis that the United Kingdom remainedoutside the e.c. at the very time we were negotiating to get in:   and, inpresent circumstances, it might be thought unwise to try.2
7.     If my colleagues are cf the opinion that the e.c. negotiations musthave the priority, the implications are clear.   Early implementation of our new agricultural support policy in its entirety becomes impossible and thefull savings we have been looking to achieve for the Exchequer will have tobe postponed,OTHER POSSIBILITIES8.     If it is decided not to pursue our proposals for comprehensive changesin our support arrangements while negotiations with the e.c. are going on,we cannot simply leave matters there and do nothing more.   We must beready, in case the e.c. negotiations fail, to put those changes into operation without further delay.   We must make preparations for this now.9.     I do not believe however that the e.c. negotiations preclude us from doing anything.   There are some changes we could make which, even if more limited In scope than our comprehensive proposals, would nevertheless he a move in the direction we want and could achieve worthwhile economies soon.We ought to go ahead with these, for we must not be seen to have abandoned,once in office, the policy we are committed to.   Moreover, to keep uppressure on this front would enable us more readily to move forward withthat policy in full, should we not succeed in Europe.   I recommend to mycolleagues that we should go ahead with schemes for beef, cereals, and lamb.10.   There are several reasons why it is appropriate to make a start withbeef and cereals.   These are key commodities for agricultural   expansionwhether we are in the e.c. or out, and our farmers will be watching to see what we do about them.    Inaction will be interpreted as meaning that weare having second thoughts about our policy   and that expansion may be in doubt.   A minimum import price/levy scheme for cereals is already inoperation, and a scheme for beef has been under negotiation for some time.Thus we have an existing basis on which to build.   Whitehall generally isalready familiar with the arrangements.   The overseas suppliers will beexpecting us to make a move.   Unless we do so, we shall begin to losecredibility, and the momentum behind our hew policy will start to evaporate.11,   Although lamb is not in the sane category, we should go ahead at thesame time with a lamb scheme.   This would help us to firm up market prices for meat generally to the benefit of the Exchequer.   Given the nature of thetrade, the aim, for the present, would be a relatively simple levy scheme.3
12.   We should also introduce levy schemes for milk products other thanbutter and cheese.   These would not directly save Exchequer money, sincethe milk guarantee is financed by the consumer.   But they would increase the dairy industry&apos;s income and have a profoundly favourable effect on itsconfidence; provide some levy income; and should someivhat reduce the importbill.   This should be examined urgently between Departments and with the domestic interests concerned.13.   My proposals for beef, cereals and lamb can be taken forward withoutconflicting with our negotiating position with the e.c..   They can be progressively developed to fit the system we shall have to adopt if vre go into the Common Market or the one we are committed to introducing if westay out.   We shall have to take a firm lino with our principal suppliersand show our determination to carry this through.   I do not underrate thedifficulties of negotiating these arrangements which affect the five PartyCereals Agreement and, so far as meat is concerned, the obligations toAustralia, New Zealand and the Irish Republic.   We may well not succeed in getting agreement and some of their reciprocal obligations to us may be rvfcrisk.   We have always recognised this possibility.   But unless we make a determined move we shall never succeed in achieving our objectives.14.   The measures I propose should secure useful and early benefit to theExchequer provided we open negotiations at once.   They should also providegrea/bor confidomc among farmers by safeguarding against the disruption ofour market by imports.   Both these aspects are important because we needurgently to get agricultural expansion moving forward.   One of the surestways in which we can limit the cost of going into the e.c. is by growing morefood at home.   But even if cor negotiations to go into the e.c. fail we shallstill badly need extra home  jroduction on balance of payments grounds.   these were the reasons we advanced in cur manifesto in pledging ourselves to increased production.   The sooner we can get this under way tho moro valuableit will be.I i15.   Production has not been increasing, however, to the extent needed and since the last Price Review farmers&apos; costs have already risen substantially.I believe some incentives will be necessary in the autumn.   I need more information on the way things are developing before I can say what will berequired, but I foresee no reason for changing the established special review machinery.4
16.   Cereals.   The scheme we now operate provides for minimum import prices for the main cereals supported by country levies in the case of importsfrom countries which have agreed to observe, whore possible, the minimum import prices and by general levies on other imports.   The purpose of thescheme (which was introduced by the previous Conservative administration)was to put a floor into the market, not to replace deficiency payments.   Inthis respect it has been reasonably successful.   Levy revenue (currently about 0.5 million per annum) is less than would be tho case if general leviesoperated across the board based on the lowest price of imports from any source; but world competitive forces hove minimised the balance of paymentsdisadvantage of the co-operating country arrangements.   We cannot makesignificant changes in the existing arrangements without the agreement ofthe co-signatories to the Five Party Agreement, which runs until June 1971.But I propose that we should go all out meantime to get agreement to raiseminimum import prices by about  3 per ten.   There could be some increase inlevy income and some saving in deficiency payments, the amount of whichwould be bound to depend on how the market in home produced grain moves.It is impossible to quantify these effects, but the initial importance ofthe move, is that it will limit the potential liability to the Exchequer.For each  1 per ton by which the market is lifted, liability for deficiency round on cereals is reduced by some  12 million.17*   Beef.   A scheme has been under discussion with overseas suppliers forsome months.   Like the cereals scheme, the original aim was to put a floorinto the market and get a greater measure of market stability by securing a target price by means of general levies.   We should press on with thisscheme.   I propose a target price of 200/- per cvrt.   This compares with thefigure of 197/- at which the actual market price is now estimated for thisyear.   At those figures we could expect Exchequer savings on deficiency round at the rate of nearly  4 million a year.   As with cereals, there could be a big reduction in potential Exchequer liability.   Each 1/- percwt. lift in the, market price reduces liability by  I5 million.   Beef prices are at present high and the improvement since the 1970 Annual Review isalready expected to yield a saving of  3f million on the estimated expenditurethen foreseen for this year.   A strong market like this is just the situationin which it is easiest to go for a firm floor price at the sort of levelI have suggested.   In negotiations we should need to retain freedom to raisethe target price in future.   We must also be free to adjust the arrangements5
for market discipline on the home producers provided under this scheme,so that over time we can bring them into line with our proposals for a fall back guarantee which forces producers to watch the market while notholding back expansion generally.     The scheme would need to providespecial arrangements for the Irish Republic on whose produce we could not put lovios at the present time.     I heave in mind to establish a dii-ectrelation between Irish direct support and our own, so that the two wouldmove together.17.   Lamb.     because.sc of the nature of the trade and the position of NewZealand as the dominant supplier, the right course initially would bo togo for a general levy at flat rates to be determined from time to tine inrelation to tho internal market price we aim to achieve.     It would notbe practicable to get a direct correlation between the two.     As with beef,we should have to make special arrangements for the Irish.     We should aimfor a levy of some 3d per lb.     This would yield a revenue of around S-jr million, and if there were a corresponding increase in prices of honeproduced lamb a reduction of some  5 million in liability for deficiency round.     This would mainly affect Now Zealand.     They are well aware of our general policy.     With tho increase in lanb prices over tho lastyear or so they have been doing very well out of our market.18.   To the extent that cereals prices rise, there will bo consequential increases in animal feed costs.     Higher costs on milk can be passed onvia tho retail price without affecting Exchequer expenditure.     but while higher beef and lamb prices would tend to firm up tho returns on other livestock products (with some benefit to the Exchequer) more directcompensation through guaranteed prices of the main livestock products naybo needed and would be an additional charge to the Exchequer to be set against the gains.     Allowing for this, tho changes I propose shouldyield rather more than  10 million over a year from savings in deficiency round and lovy revenue.     This may not soon a very big sun:   it is nevertheless well worthwhile going for.     The really important consideration at this stage however is that wo should be keeping thomarket firm and be starting the move into the period of changeover (ofat least three years) during which market prices will be raised6
successively so as to replace deficiency payments.     At the outset, food prices nust not rise too quickly, and the overseas suppliers and our owntrade nust have tine to adjust.     Perhaps oven nore important initiallyis that tho changes, by getting a higher floor into tho narkot, would reduce the potential Exchequer liability for deficiency payments to thetune of many  million.     As tho floor is successively raised in(accordance with the policy objective, direct savings increase and the potential liability is still further reduced.MASTERS FOR DECISION19. &quot;0 must now decide whether or not to go for the comprehensive changes,to which wo aro pledged, concurrently with the negotiations with the e.c..20.   If we decide that we cannot conduct those two major negotiationssinultaneousl3r, then I invite my colleagues to agree that -a. negotiations should bo started forthwith on the schemes forbeef, cereals and lamb described abovet with the intention of introducing then this autumn.b. Officials should be instructed to report as soon as practicableon arrangements for levy schemes for milk products, other thanbutter and choose.c. Preparations should be nade for introdiicing tho comprehensivechanges in the support syston to which we aro committed, in case thoEEC negotiations break down.     I propose that officials should boinstructed accordingly, and asked to report by, say the turn of theyear.      They must bo givon a positive remit, and for that purposewe must-confirm the basis on which our now agricultural policy wasdecided, namely that we shall take a firm line with supplying countries in order to secure our objectives.J ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 3W120 July 19707
