PUBLIC EXPENDITURE review memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. We are fully committed to achieving large economies in public expenditure.    The immediate objective is to provide scope for reductions in personal and company taxation, as part of our strategy for encouraginginitiative and enterprise and stimulating savings and thus contributingtowards a higher rate of growth in national output.2,        The plans we have inherited imply a faster growth of public expenditure over the next few years (an average annual rate of about. 7 per cent) than the prospective growth of national output (GDP) (lessthan 3 per cent).    This would have inevitably involved still further increases In rates of taxation.    We ourselves have undertaken new commitments, in defence, social expenditure and otherwise.    In face of all this to achieve the actual reductions in taxation to which we are pledged isa formidable task, which will require difficult policy choices,3.        We have taken as the immediate target for net savings in expenditure by 1974-75 the figure of  1,700 million, with a start of some hundreds of  millions in 1971-72.    Nearly  700 million will come from abolishinginvestment grants, but so tight is the liquidity of companies that virtually all of this will have to be returned to the company sector if investment isnot to suffer.    This leaves about  1, 000 million.    But nearly two-thirds of this will be required to eliminate the excessive growth in expenditure programmes inherited from our predecessors to which I have referred.The remainder will not be enough by itself for reductions in personaltaxation on the necessary scale.    To meet that objective in full v/e mustrely at least in part on our policies to stimulate a faster growth of the economy in due course.    But experience demonstrates conclusively thefolly of pre-empting additional resources before they become available.Any further growth in output will represent a bonus available for allocationby us in v/ays that seem desirable at the time.4, In seeking for areas in which to make economies in public expenditure suggest that we should be guided by the following considerations:CP(70) 20 COPY NO J :120 July 1970CABINET
a. The public sector is providing services which could more appropriately and efficiently be provided by the private sector.eg. industrial research projects, purchase of land for development,and activities of nationalised industries falling outside their main purpose.b. The method and scope of support by grants from public funds for particular sectors of the economy, notably manufacturing industry and agriculture, are unsuitable or work against the objective of reducing taxation, or both,c. Other forms of assistance to Industry, notably in aircraft and aerospace projects, but going beyond them, use our resourceswastefully,d. Some personal subsidies in the housing and social servicesfield are being distributed to large numbers of people who are wellabl* to pay for the services in whole or in part.e. In some areas expenditure which may in principle bedesirable is growing at a rate which cannot be justified given otherneeds and objectives, eg, money spent by the Research Councils.5. The Treasury hr-c &amp;uineh*d &amp;thorough review of all the main fields of public sector expenditure whereit was thought worthwhile savings could he found.    With the co-operationof all Departments concerned, preliminary studies have been made.These suggest that we should seek our main sources of savings as follows.ASSISTANCE TO industry.        i. Investment Grants.    Yfe are committed to ending them,and I suggest that we agree to announce this in October.   We must give careful consideration to the most effective alternative ways of restoring company cash flows and assisting investment by tax allowances and changes in company taxation.    These points, whichwill have to be covered at the same time, need further discussion between the Ministers concerned so as toreach agreement in time for the October announcement.ii.       Agriculture.    We are committed to replacing the deficiencygrants by import levies, with some fall-back to price support to sustain farmers1 incomes.    The main problems are international and include the effects on our balance of payments, trade agreements with Commonwealth and other countries, and our negotiations forjoining the Six.    I understand the Minister of Agriculture is proposing to arrange for examination of all these matters.    We shall need todecide what to say in the autumn statement.2
Hi,      Aircraft and Space Projects.     All major projects are nowsubject to rigorous cost/benefit analysis.    We should take resoluteaction, where this analysis demonstrates evident economic waste.iv. Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59).    We are committed to scaling down drastically the scope of IRCTs activities.There Is a case, which I support, for eliminating thi3 Item ofexpenditure altogether.v. Technological Services.    I think appreciable savings can and should be made in technological support for industry givendirect and in various other ways by the Ministry of Technology.I suggest we take as our aim a 50 per cent saving in this block ofexpenditure and study further what is involved.    Much of this isresearch and development,vi. Other Assistance to Industry.    But for our pre-Electionundertakings we should have wanted to phase out the R-egionalEmployment Premium as soon as possible.    It Is for consideration whether a start on this should be made before 1974-75 or whether we must wait until then and phase out with all due speed.    In anycase we must examine very critically applications for special assistance from particular firms or industries including shipbuilding and we should repeal the main provisions of the industrial expansion Act,    If we decide to support specific industrial projectswe shall where necessary take specific powers through new legislation.DEFENCE7. Our East of Suez commitment will make it hard to contain defence expenditure, but we must make every effort to do so.    The defence secretary has set on foot a number of studies designed, first to ascertainhow savings on the forecast levels of defence expenditure can best be made,and second, to assess the costs and priorities of new defence projects.At a time when many programmes are being heavily cut, I suggest as areasonable objective that defence expenditure should not be allowed to exceed the figures 3et out in Cmnd, 4234.SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH8.        The Governments support for pure research is provided mainlythrough a block grant allocated by the Council for Scientific Policy to themain Research Councils.    This is supported by the Government becausethe pay-off is usually too remote for Industry or private institutions to be willing to carry any significant load.    The total has been rising fairly fastand is programmed to go on rising.    We should seek savings here and review the whole basis of the system.
SIGillT9. I do not think we should cut very substantially into the mainmotorway, trunk road and principal road programme.    On the other handsome reduction in the later years should not be too difficult, and work onthe less important roads needs rigorous scrutiny.    Expenditure on transport infrastructure projects (eg. the Fleet line) is planned to riserapidly.    I believe we should apply stiffer cost/be:iefit criteria to these projects, which should produce worthwhile savings.SOCIAL SERVICES10.       A careful balance must be struck here.    There are basic needs of high priority which will continue to require large allocations of public funds.In some areas, however, mostly peripheral to the main services, publiclyprovided or heavily subsidised services are made too widely available;and in others, notably the health service, we need a study of objectives and alternative ways of securing them.    A substantial contribution must bemade from this sector If we are to find sufficient savings.    detailed proposals will require further work;  but I suggest that the directions inwhich we should look should be:-i. Higher charges - possibly even new types of charges - inthe Health ServicecII.        Withdrawal of welfare and school milk, and of the subsidy on school meals.iii. Substantial savings on housing as local authority rents are brought closer into line with the true value of the accommodation.In all these cases arrangements must be made to avoid hardship byselective relief or assistance.iv. Limiting future upratings of the main national insurance benefits,v. Family support (a study to be made of the scope forrationalising of family allowances and child tax allowances).vl.        The Open University, which I propose that we close downimmediately.LOCAL AUTHORITIES11.        i. Improved organisation of local environmental services(mainly public health and anti-pollution) may produce economies,though the services can probably not be cut.    Early savings are possible on capital expenditure for urban development and on localauthority assistance to industry.4
ii.      The measures I have already referred to will reducecurrent expenditure of local authorities.    A general squeezethrough the rate support grant negotiations would encourageeconomies including manpower.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES12.       Capital spending (at present about  1,500 million a year) shouldbe reduced.   I propose that officials examine the implications of cuts of5 per cent and 10 per cent in 1972-73.    This would produce savings alsoin 1971-72.     Meanwhile new optional investment, especially insubsidiary activities, should be avoided,COST REDUCTION PROGRAMMES13.       Separately from the consequences of the measures listed above for manpower and other administrative expenditure, the manpowerrequirements of Departments will be under intensive review.14.       All the proposals set out above, fully implemented, would still not meet in full the objective described in paragraph 3.    Treasuryofficials have been instructed to examine other possibilities, and I would welcome further suggestions from my colleagues.    If some of the specificsavings I have suggested are found on closer examination to be impracticable-able or undesirable, we shall have to substitute othersr    Most of theproposals require further study before we can take firm decisions and instructions for such studies chowld be given now.15.       Finally, there is the question of new demands.    While we are working to secure majcr economies proposals for further expenditure are being made.    In some few cases these will be unavoidable.    Forthe rest we must ask our colleagues to defer their proposals until wecan see the picture as a whole.CONCLUSIONS16,       I ask my colleague s.-a. to endorse the broad objectives of this public expenditurereview;b. to agree that we should seek the savings in the directionsoutlined in this memorandum;c. to agree that further official studies of these savingsshould be urgently pursued with the Treasury, and reportsmade to Treasury and Departmental Ministers concerned sothat agreement can be reached in each case;5
d. to agree that officials should examine any other areas ofexpenditure where worthwhile savings could be found,17.       We shall need to consider in September the results of the review and the decisions reached, with a view to publication of a White Paper on public expenditure as soon after the Recess as possible.    In the meantime i hope that Treacury Ministers may be authorised to agree wi&amp;  he ministers concerned the form and timing of any announcements that may be required before the White Paper.M V treasury Chambers SW120 July 1970II6&apos;&apos;
