CONCORDE j THE LEGAL POSITION IN JULY 1970Memorandum by the Attorney-General andthe Solicitor-GeneralIf the British Government decided that it wished to withdraw from the Concorde project it is unlikely that France would agree tocancellation.    If Britain withdrew unilaterally France would probablytake the case to the International Court alleging a breach of the originalAnglo-French Memorandum of Understanding of 29 November 1962, andclaiming damages.    This Memorandum of Understanding is registered as a Treaty at the United Nations and it would be enforced by theInternational Court of Justice as such.    It contains no provisionexpressly permitting either party to withdraw from it.2.     Efforts in 1967 and 1968 by the British Government to reach agreement with France upon the circumstances in which the project should be cancelled culminated in an exchange of correspondence inSeptember 1968 between Mr. Wedgwood Benn and the then french minister of Transport, M. Chamant,    This exchange included provision to the effect.-(a) that the future of the project must be judged by its commercial prospects j and,(b) that if at the end of 1969 the estimated development costexceeded  600 million at January 1966 prices, each of the two ministers was &quot;to propose to their respective Governments an amendment to the original Memorandum of Understanding of1962 releasing each Government from any automatic obligationto continue the project jointly&quot;. In the event the  600 millionfigure was exceeded before the end of 1969.3.     At the end of 1969 the French Minister said that soundings amongsthis colleagues indicated that if he proposed such an amendment to them,his Government would refuse to accept it.    Differences arose between thetwo Governments as to the interpretation to be put upon the correspondence,and since these differences could not be resolved, each Governmentcontinued from the end of 1969 on the basis of its own assertion as to theCP(70) 17COPY No     5417 July 1970CABINET1
correct interpretation.    In particular, the British Government made itclear that it maintained its view as to the extent of our commitment asset cui in the earlier correspondence and negotiations, but that withoutprejudice to this view it was prepared to continue with the project untilthe end of June 197 0.4. Having reviewed the British legal position in the light of thehistory of the project and the negotiations that have taker, place, wehave come to the following conclusions.LIABILITY5.     The first question is whether, if Britain withdrovv unilaterally atthis stage, the International Court would hold Britain liable in damages toFrance.    The British case would rest on three principal grounds.(a) That there had been such a fundamental change in the circumstancessurrounding the project since 1962 as to justify us in internationallaw as withdrawing from the treaty,(b) The Benn/Chamant corresspondence referred to above.    KFrance refused to release Britain, the British case would be -(i)     that in so doing the French were not acting in good faith and that whatever the construction to be put upon the correspondence, it did at least show that in 1968 the twoGovernments were in agreement that circumstances could arise in which it would be quite unreasonable to goon with the project;(ii)     that in view of all the set-backs and the escalation in costs since 1968, it was utterly unreasonable of france to demand that Britain should go on,(c) Britain would argue that it was from the outset implicit in theagreement that the continued participation of the two governments in the project was dependent upon criteria of cost and commercial prospects, and that this implication had been fortified by the subsequent Benn/Charnant exchange.    As things had turned out these criteria could not be met, with the result that we were entitled to withdraw.We do not know to which of these grounds the Court would attachmost weight.    While the outcome of litigation before the international court is always difficult to predict, on the whole we think the Court wouldbe more likely to find in our favour than to find against us.    In our opinion the odds can be assessed as to 6 to 4 in our favour.2
36,     We have considered the various heads under which France might beexpected to claim damages.    We understand that the possibility of theFrench continuing with the project alone can be discounted, since the burden on their economy would be unacceptable.    On this assumption, france would no doubt claim under the following heads:-(a) Past expenditure.(b) Loss of foreign exchange.(c) Cancellation charges.(a)    Pazt expenditure the French would argue that the money already spent was money thrownaway.    We understand that there is nothing substantial in the way ofincidental benefits (technological fallout so-called) that Britain could claimto set off against what the French have spent.    They have spent orcommitted so far about  230 million.    The British reply would be thatthis was money thrown away anyway and that even if we had continued theywould have got none of it backs    This appears from paragraph 30 of theMinister of Technology&apos;s present paper, based upon the assessment of thejoint Economic Prospects Committee.    In fact by cancelling now we willbe saving them money because on any showing not all future expenditure will be recovered, as that paper explains.    However, we cannot be sure that the International Court would accept this argument.    The Court might take the view that the making of profits was not the purpose, or at all events the sole purpose, of the two Governments,.    It they took that view the Court might assess damages payable to France on two bases:-(i)   That France was entitled to be compensated to che extentof the whole of the money thrown away, that is to say, 230 million.(ii)   That total reimbursement to that extent was quite unrealistic,but that France was entitled to some payment to compensate herfor what one    might call &quot;loss of prestige&quot; resulting fromthe failure of the project.    It is impossible to forecast whatthe measure of damages might be on this footing.    The Courtmight take a figure vaguely equivalent to the cancellationcharges discussed under sub-paragraph (c) below, say 20 million -  30 million.As between these two possibilities, we consider that it is most unlikelythat the toical reimbursement basis would commend itself to the Court, but one cannot entirely exclude that possibility.    The &quot;loss of prestige&quot; basisis much the more probable.
The French might argue that because of the British withdrawal they are nolonger in a position to earn the foreign exchange that they would have earned from the sale of the aircraft abroad, and that Britain was liable to compensate them for this loss.    In certain circumstances, the incurring ofexpenditure may be justified in order to earn foreign exchange.    Beyond acertain point the cost is such as no longer to justify the expenditure.    where this point lies is a matter of judgment, and depends upon economic circumstances.    In the report of the Concorde Economic ProspectsCommittee it is said that there would be a loss over the whole range of possible sales.    If it were decided to cancel the project Britain would argue that the foreign exchange benefit was being earned at the expense of a quitedisproportionate use of resources.    In any event it is difficult to see howany such loss could be quantified in terms of compensation.    We do notthink that Britain would be held liable to pay damages under this head.(c) Cancellation ChargesJi Britain cancelled the Concorde project the Government would have to paycancellation charges to the manufacturers as respects contracts alreadyentered into.    These would be of the order of  20 -  30 million and theFrench Government officials have Indicated that they would be under asimilar liability to the French contractors.     The French might beexpected to claim from Britain the charges they had to pay.    Our feeling isthat this would be a difficult claim to resist and consider our colleagues should assume that if Britain lost before the International Court, she would at least be liable to pay the French their cancellation charges.CONCLUSION ON DAMAGES7.     If Britain lost before the International Court our assessment oflikely liability is as follows;-(a) Much the most probable assessment is that the British liabilitywould be between  40 million and  00 million made up of theFrench cancellation charges and damages for &quot;loss of prestige&quot;.(b) One cannot entirely exclude the possibility, though it is unlikely,that Britain might be held liable for French expenditure to date,that is to say  230 million.THE LEGAL POSITION IN THE FUTURE,   IF THE GOVERNMENTDECIDES TO CONTINUE NOW8.     The Government may decide to continue with the project at thisstage, but may wish to withdraw later.    The next natural break point would be when the results of tests at mach 2 are available.    This, weUnderstand, will be at about the end of March next year.    The question is whether, if Britain went on until March, the legal position would be betteror worse than it is now.    We assume, as seems probable, that the test4
re suits which would then be available would do no more than confirm thepredictions in the current report of the Concorde Directing Committee.In those circumstances the French would no doubt argue that nothing newhad emerged since July 1970, and that, having gone on in July againstthe background of those reports, Britain could not justify withdrawal   inMarch.    The British answer to this would be that continuation up to that point was justified and entirely logical on the ground that the completionof the mach 2 tests was exactly the point in the development programmethat M. Chamant the then French Minister of Transport, proposed in his letter to the Minister of Technology of 27 September 1968.    This wasprecisely the time at which a decision was to be taken on the continuation ofthe project based en commercial prospects.    Our feeling is that these twoarguments are evenly balanced and that there would be no materialdifference between Britair.rs ]egal position now and in March 1971.TACTICS9.     If the Cabinet decided to withdraw now, the question would arise of how and when this should be effected.    One factor to be borne in mind is thatthe International Court in deciding on the merits of the British case onliability, would pay regard to the manner of withdrawal.    The defencecould be most favourably presented if Britain had first attempted tonegotiate an agreed termination of the whole project, or failing that, for withdrawal on agreed terms.    Such negotiations could of course be veryprolonged.    During thia time the project would have to continue at a costof another  5 million a month.    This money would have been spent in anattempt to reduce the 40 per cent risk of Britain having to pay probably notmore than  60 million (but, it must be added, conceivably, the higher figure of  230 million).    On balance, we consider that negotiation for morethan a very short period can scarcely be justified on purely legal grounds.Upon this footing there should probably be the minimum of delay in informing the French of any decision to withdraw, consistent, of course,with customary diplomatic courtesies, for the closer to the mach 2 testresults, the more vulnerable Britain would be to the criticism that she should at least have continued the project until then.10.     U the Cabinet decided to continue with the project at this stage, itwould be necessary to make it clear to the French, as the Government didlast December, that this further commitment on Britainrs part wassimilarly limited, and further, that in continuing beyond July, Britain wasnot to be taken as accepting that indefinite continuation of the project was justified on the basis of current reports.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS11.     (a)  If Britain withdrew against the wishes of the FrenchGovernment, and were taken to the International Court,the Court would on balance be more likely to find in britain&apos;s favour than against.
(b) If the Court found against Britain, liability wouldprobably be of the order of  40 -  60 million but thepossibility of an award of up to  230 million cannot be excluded.(c) If the Cabinet were to decide to withdraw from the project,there is no significant legal distinction between takingthat decision now and taking it in March 1971.PRG HLaw Officers1 Department WC217 July 19706
