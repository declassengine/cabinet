CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(70) 18 COPY NO   5417 July 1970CABINETCOAL PRICE increases memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury the National Coal Board (NCB) have proposed increases in coking,industry and electricity coal prices in order to break even on collieryaccount in 1970-71 and to avoid reaching the statutory deficit limit of 5 0 million.2.     The NCB assume that cost increases would rise overall by8 per cent in 1970-71 compared with 1969-70, including an allowance foran average wage increase of 16 per cent next November.    (About55 per cent of costs are wage a)     Without the wage increase the cost increase would be about 5 per cent.    Other factors relevant in consideringthe proposal are:-(a) Coal demand is buoyant in the United Kingdom and elsewhere;supplies cannot be readily increased and stocks are expectedto fall to very low working levels.    At present we are not inany position to face a strike.(b) The industry has had a good productivity record (over the last ten years an average increase of 4. 9 per cent a year); a9 per cent increase la 1968-69 reflected increasing use ofnew machinery and a high rate of closures; the increase wasno more than 2 per cent in 1969-70; the rise so far this year has been 3 per cent.(c) Absenteeism in the coal industry is too high and machineryutilisation too low; the NCB&apos;s forecasts assume no more thanthat the present position will be held.(d) There are no proposals for increasing bituminous domestic coal prices, and there would be no immediate or direct effect, ofany significance, on the cost of living.(e) Coking coal is used primarily by the British Steel Corporation (BSC);and the electricity industry is much the most important user ofindustrial coal; the increases would therefore make their impactthrough their effect on electricity and steel prices; and BSCwould want to make consequential adjustments at once and theelectricity industry to do so from October; the total effect on prices generally would be about 0. 3 per cent; very early decisions on these consequentials will be needed.1
(f) If the NCBls accumulated deficit were allowed to increasefurther, there would be little prospect that it could everbe wiped out.(g) The NCB believe they can get out of the red in a seller&apos;s market;strictly there is no power to stop them, and a price increase would be an appropriate response to the market situation.3.     The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) have asked for wage increases of 22 per cent.    The NCB have assumed increases of 16 per cent.The Minister of Technology agrees that, in the general context of the inflationary spiral, this is too high, but is of the view that a settlement at such a significantly lower level as to justify insisting on a much lowerprice increase now, is unlikely.ALTERNATIVE RATES OF INCREASE4.     The tables below show the estimated effect in the current and thenext financial year of alternative rates of increase in wages and prices.The figures for 1971-72 are very tentative, and based on necessarilyarbitrary assumptions     It is not possible to give estimates for any lateryear because the variables involved (the rate of increase in productivity,the supply/demand situation for coal, the level of possible wage demands)are subject t to too much uncertainty.    For this reason, nc financial objective has yet been fixed for any period after March, 1971.    the tables illustrate the effect on the NCB colliery account (deficit orsurplus) of increases in both wages and prices ranging from 0-15 per cent.For example, a wage increase of 5 per cent with a price increase of10 per cent would produce a surplus of   1 million? if wages rose by10 per cent then a coal price increase of about 12^ per cent would benecessary for the Board to break even.5.     The effective date assumed for price increases is mid-August,the earliest feasible date.    For wages November is assumed.    Eachmonthrs delay in increasing prices means lost revenue in 1970-71 of 400, 000 for each 1 per cent of a price increase.    The tables show theposition for 1970-71 and 1971-72.1970-71 ESTIMATED COLLIERY ACCOUNT OUTTURNPercentage pricesincrease 1 1 0 5 10 15  millionPercentage wages0	- 23	-   7	+  7	4- 225	- 31	- 15	+   1	+ 1610	- 39	- 23	-  7	H-  815	- 47	- 31	- 15	02

In very broad terms the NCB*s proposals are designed to accommodate a wage increase of 16 per cent without a further price increase.    If the miners got 16 per cent and the price increase   were reduced to.-(a) 10 per cent, a further price increase would have to followquickly afterwards if deficits on collieries were to be avoided;even taking into account profits on ancillaries, a further price increase would be needed not later than the spring of 1971;(b) 12^ per cent, there would be a growing deficit on collieries;this might just be held until the autumn of 1971 by profits onancillaries, but it would be an uncomfortably close thing.7.     The weak position of the NCB in dealing with the forthcomingwage claim is the low level of coal stocks.    It would not be sensible tohold coal prices down during a period of shortage.    Our object must beto enable the NCB to rebuild their stocks before the next round of wage negotiations.8.     The tables above show that the size of price increases depend largely on the level of wage increases negotiated.    An average wage of16 per cent would be far too high for our management of the economy.If the Government persuades the NCB to accept a lower price increasethan they think necessary, it will be forcing them, in considering themeasures which they must take to avoid a deficit on colliery account,to assume a lower level of wage increases than they may in the event be able to negotiate, bearing in mind that we cannot really tolerate a coal strike this autumn.3Percentage pricesincrease 0 5 10 15  millionPercentage wages
9. Our aim should be to stiffen, the NCB&apos;s handling of wage claims,and the following points are important especially if a big price increase is accepted(a) There is no question of taking legislation to enable the NCB to exceed the present statutory limit on their deficit on thecontrary all practicable steps must be taken to reduce it as quickly as possible;  the aim must be to have no deficit oncolliery activities; we shall want to consider discontinuanceor disposal of those ancillary activities which have no realconnection with the NCB*s main business (at present theseancillaries bring in a profit of about  12 million a year).(b) Strenuous efforts must be made to reduce absenteeism amongminers and to improve machine utilisation, as Lord Robenssaid in his speech to the NUM.     The forthcoming report bythe National Board for Prices and Incomes is likely to containuseful suggestions about methods of cost saving.    We shalllook for the co-operation of the NCB in putting them into effect,and securing a good response from the mine workers.(c) We cannot change overnight the conditions in which the NCBoperate, but it is desirable to expose the NCB to greatercompetition as quickly as possible.    Increased use of otherfuels (oil and gas) offer some opportunity in the course of time.A number of proposals for converting power stations to oil willbe coming forward; the Government are likely to approve these.But no further conversions are practical until next year and the opportunities thereafter are restricted by the limitations on thenumber of stations which the hard pressed electricity service can take out of service at a time.(d) Additional competition might also be produced in the longer term by allowing imports of coal.    But this is not an immediatepossibility, for there are no large supplies available; only smallspot cargoes.    It would also be necessary to consider thebalance of payments implications.   And there is no doubt thatthere would be an immediate reaction from the miners   (Aweek&apos;s strike costs nearly 3 million tons and there is no possibility of making this good by imports quickly.)   It isregrettable, but the room for manoeuvre is limited.10.    It will put us in a stronger position to take a tough line with theNCB on these questions if, as the Minister and I propose, we agree toextend the existing power to give special assistance to the NCB inconnection with the social costs of the rundown of the industry.    TheMinister will be putting proposals on this to the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy.4
CONCLUSIONS11.    As I see it, there are two alternatives.    The first is a price increase at a level which assumes no increase in wages at all inNovember.    In practice this would mean another price increase very-soon, though it would then be apparent to all that the second price increase was directly attributable to the intervening wage increase.12.     The second alternative is to allow a big enough price increase toenable the NCB to carry on for at least a yeara    Two price increases inquick succession would be disadvantageous from every point of view.I2f per cent - compared with the 15 per cent now proposed by the NCB -is the lowest figure offering a real prospect of avoiding a second increasewithin months.    My conclusion is therefore that this is the figure weshould go for.M V treasury Chambers SWl17 July 19705
