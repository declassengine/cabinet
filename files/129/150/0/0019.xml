THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the celebrations of 13 July went off better than anyone expected andas a result there has been a reduction of tension but the situation remainspotentially very dangerous.    Feelings of antagonism have been enflamed.The Catholics are still stunned by the Falls Road episode of a few weeksback.    The country is full of arms, legal and illegal, and the irish republican Army (IRA) who remained strangely quiet during the Orangecelebrations could at any moment step up their campaign,2. Our objective must be to make progress with the reduction of tensionand plan for a gradual return to more normal conditions and the withdrawalof the Army from the task of maintaining public order which should becomeor-ce again the province of the police.    This will take time but it is urgent.The dangers come from two sides.    We may see a recrudescence of violentprotest by the Catholic population with the connivance or stimulation of their .    This v/ould carry with it, in addition to the threat to law and order,further dangers for Mr Lynches Government in Dublin.    We must walk verywarily where Catholic susceptibilities are concerned.    The other danger ispressure from the Orangemen on Major Chichesfcer-Clark, v/hoseGovernments position is far from secure.    He is under continuous threatfrom Paisley and only a few more defections would put him in a virtually impossible position.    This for us is a very grim prospect indeed.    an extreme Unionist Government at Stormont which would almost certainly want to go back on the reform programme is hardly likely to be one with which wecould co-operate or for whose support we could justify the use of theBritish Army,    This in turn might force us to take over the Governmentourselves,3.        There are two immediate problems that require handling and I discussed them on Friday with Major Chichester-Clark.    He has devolved ascheme which by tackling both problems simultaneously should in my judgment stand a good chance of success, though there are clearly seriousrisks involved.    But no policy in Northern Ireland, even a policy if inaction,is free from risk.copy NO      54CP(70) 1920 July 1970CABINET
4. The first problem is that of the so-called &quot;no go&quot; areas - someCatholic areas of Belfast and the Bogside area of Londonderry, whichhave not been more than thinly policed for some years, where for sometime normal law and order has virtually been suspended and the royal ulster Constabulary (RUC) withdrawn.    They are at present returning inforce to the Falls and Ardoyne areas in Belfast, but they have not so far been able to return to the Bogside, save in certain limited parts in company with military police.    Clearly this situation cannot be tolerated.    no government can for long acquiesce in an absence of law and order in anypart of its territories.    These &quot;no go&quot; areas are centres of K.epublicanismand the withdrawal of the RUC has meant both a loss of contact and intelligence on the one hand and freer opportunities for the Republicans onthe other.    Finally Paisley is making the continuation of the &quot;no go&quot; areas the main feature of his attack on Major Chichester-Clark and is succeedingin doing him considerable political harm thereby.5. The other problem is the forthcoming marches.    There is inparticular the march oi the Apprentice Boys of Derry on 12 August whichhas caused much trouble in the past. For the rest of the year there willbe further paradeSj virtually all Protestant.6. What emerged from my discussion with Major Chichester-Clark wasa plan to return the RUC to the &quot;no go&quot; areas and to impose a ban on political marches until the end of this year.    I had feared that he would wish to re-enter the Bogside as a major gesture with a considerable displayof force but the proposal is now that the RUC, who incidentally no longercarry weapons, should progressively return accompanied at first by themilitary police.    They would carry out the normal functions of policemenon the beat and would be careful to avoid provocative actions.    This plan,incidentally, has the support of the Chief Constable, Sir Arthur Young, whois a notable dove in any matter of police tactics.7. Major Chichester-Clark believes that if this week some substantial progress can be made in restoring normal police patrolling in these areas,he will be able to impose a ban on marches for the rest of the year withouta violent Orange reaction.    The point is that while the &quot;no go&quot; areas areCatholic, and in a sense the return of the police may be regarded as a victory of the Protestants, the Catholic processions do not really comeagain until Easter and therefore the ban on processions for the rest of theyear will seem like a victory for the Catholics,&amp;. I believe this plan is worth trying.    It is clearly sensible andmoderate and designed to achieve progress towards normality coupled withthe reduction of provocation.    I do not see how there can be reasonableobjection if the PJLTC, now unarmed, take up again normal police duties inthe &quot;no go&quot; areas.    But I must not disguise from my colleagues the risk that is involved if the police should come under violent attack.    It would benecessary in those circumstances to provide them with military support, theextent of which would have to be carefully defined, because if they were merely withdrawn in the face of violence there would be a final collapse ofthe morale of the RUC and probably of the position of Major Chichester-Clarl^sGovernment.2
9. We cannot stand still and merely await the next trouble.    I hope mycolleagues will agree that we should indicate support for major Chichester-Clark in this general approach.R m home Office 37/120 July 1970
