CONCORDEMemorandum by the Minister of technology the previous Government agreed to proceed with Concorde untilthe end of June 1970 and informed the French Government that it regardedits commitments as limited tc chat date.    My predecessor had accordinglyarranged to meet the French Minister of Transport cn 16 June to review the position and to decide on the basis of any future commitment.    Thismeeting was postponed because of the Election.    It is important in orderthat there should be no doubt about our intentions that this meeting shouldbe re-arranged as soon as possible.    I now seek the agreement of mycolleagues to the line I propose to take at that meeting.2.        The Annex to this paper describes the present position on the project.   Although the technical position is still subject to a number ofuncertainties there is nc case on technical grounds for cancelling the project.    The flight trials have gone well and officials believe there is agood chance of Concordets meeting its target performance.    Thecommercial prospects are not at present encouraging but it should be borne in mind that no airline will commit Itself until after the flight tests atcruising speed, which will take place in the autumn.    However, if the lowest estimate of sales in the Concorde Economic Prospects Committee(CEPC) report (see paragraph 27 of the Annex) is achieved (ie, 50 aircraft),there will be foreign exchange earnings of some $1,200 million.3.        I believe it is too early to make a final judgment of commercial prospects,    Concorde cannot In any case be judged solely in economicterms.    There is too much at stake both industrially and politically.4.        The cancellation of Concorde at its present stage of development would be a serious blow to the aircraft industry.    The British aircraft corporation would almost certainly have to close down their Filton factory and the cancellation of the Olympus 593 would reduce the Rolls Royce BristolEngine Division in size, importance and technical ability.    There would bean immediate loss of upwards of 20, 000 jobs.    We would also be giving upthe only major advanced technological project in which we have a world lead,1CP(70) 15 COPY NO     J i17 July 1970CABINET
and inflicting a blow which would have repercussions on industrial moralegenerally and on our standing as an advanced technological country.    above all. the will of this country ever again to bring a major project to a successful concltision would be seriously in doubt.5.        The French view is that the technical and commercial prospects of concorde cannot be assessed with any certainty until the flight tests atcruising speed have been analysed.    1 , therefore, we were to seek towithdraw now, it would be in the face of French opposition.    This couldonly lead to bitter recriminations between ourselves and the French whowould argue that we were breaking a Treaty.    This could have a most damaging effect on our Common Market negotiations.    A unilateralwithdrawal on our part would also be likely to be taken by other european governments as a sign of bad faith and our reliability as a partner could be seriously called into question.6.        I consider that it would be politically indefensible and do usconsiderable harm internationally if we withdrew against the wishes of theFrench and at a time when we are only a few months from the criticalflight tests which will show whether Concorde can meet its technicalspecification.    It will take until about the end of March 1971 for thesetests to be analysed and to obtain some clearer indication of airlines&apos;reaction to selling price and performance measurements.    It must beremembered that airlines will not place firm orders until the british overseas Airways Corporation (3QAC) and Air France have done so.Air France have not completed their studies and are understood to beawaiting the results of flight tests.    BOAC, however, are alreadymaintaining that the introduction of Concorde would lead to a loss ofrevenue.    I must therefore warn colleagues that, if the results at M=2prove satisfactory, we shall have to be prepared co persuade BOAC to buyConcorde.7. I seek the agreement of my colleagues that we should proceed withConcorde until 31 March 1971 when we should review the position again inthe light of the flight test results and the airlines1 reaction; and that Ishould discuss the position with the French Minister of Transport on this basis,G RMinistry of Technology SW116 July 1970
annex the development of Concorde started in November 1962following an agreement between the then British and french governments.   Development is being funded entirely by thetwo Governments who will also be required to provide orguarantee the working capital needed to finance Concordeproduction.   The main contractors for Concorde are BAC andSNIAS for the airframe and Rolls Royce and Snecma for thepropulsion system.2.     The design aim of Concorde is that it should be ableto carry at a cruising speed of 11=2 (twice the speed of sound) a payload on initial entry into service of 20,000 lbbetween Paris/New York and 25,000 lb two years later.   Thenumber of passengers Concorde will carry will depend on theseating arrangement adopted i.e. single class approachingfirst class standard or mixed class.   In a single classconfiguration it would carry about 110 passengers.   Officialscurrently assess that Concorde is likely to enter service in mid-1974-.3.     The French prototype first flew in March 1969 and theBritish prototype in April 1969.   The first flight at super-sonic speed was achieved by the French prototype in October1969o   Concorde has now been flown up to a Mach number of just over 1.5 as compared with the cruising Mach number of 2.Approximately 4,500 hours of test and endurance flying willbe required before Concorde can obtain a certificate of airworthiness enabling it to enter airline service.   7 or possibly 8 aircraft will eventually be involved in the flight test programme - two prototypes, two pre-production aircraft and the first three or possibly four production aircraft.   The first pre-production aircraft is due to flyin mid-1971 and the first production aircraft in mid-1972.4-.     The critical tests which are still to come are those at Concorde&apos;s cruising speed of 11=2.   It will be on theresults of these tests that the manufacturers will decide what performance guarantees can be given to the airlinesand the airlines will assess the aircraft&apos;s payload and operating economics.   These tests are crucial since acommercial supersonic airliner&apos;s payload is extremely sensitive toquite small changes in performance.   A 1% increase, forexample, in either aerodynamic drag or fuel consumption is equivalent to a loss of about 1,200 lb of payload i.e. aboutthe loss of six passenger seats./The
The tests so far5.     The French and British prototypes have &quot;between them nowcompleted 223 hours of flight test of which 32 hours have been at supersonic speed,.    The French prototype reached a Machnumber of 1.5^ before, in accordance with the programme, beinggrounded at the beginning of February for modifications tobring it up to the standard required for flight tests at Ms2.It will start flying again in September.,   The results from the flight tests have been satisfactory.   The handling qualitiesand the behaviour of the aircraft: and its engines have beenvery good over the whole speed range investigated so far.6.     The British prototype resumed flying in March 1970 and completed 12 hours of satisfactory flying up to a rlach numberof 1=35 before it was grounded in April to install the more powerful engines necessary for testing at 1^=2.   This ground-ing has taken longer than expected because of a labourdispute, which has now been settled, at BAC overovertime and weekend working.   These labour difficulties havedelayed the achievement of flights at 11=2.The tests still to be done^7.     When the Concorde Directing Committee reported to ministers last November it was expected that some measurementsof performance at M=2 could be made by the end of June 1970but that the results from these tests would not be fullyassessed in terms of production aircraft performance before this Autumn0   As a result of the time lost by the labour difficulties at BAC the British assembled prototype is nowunlikely to fly before early August or to achieve Ms 2 until september.   Officials are unlikely to complete theirextrapolation of the M=2 results to the performance of theproduction aircraft before the beginning of 1971 o8.     In November last, the firms target date for obtaining acertificate of airworthiness was mid-1973 compared with anofficials&apos; estimate of Spring 1974--   As a result of are-examination of the programme combined with delays to thefirst three production aircraft, the firms have adjusted theirtarget to September 1973 with a contingency of four monthsgiving a &quot;realistic&quot; date of January 1974.    Officials believethat on the existing programme a certificate of airworthinesscould be achieved by mid-1974- by using another production aircraft (making a total of four) in the flight testprogramme.   It will, however, now be necessary for a newnozzle to be available at entry into service,    (see para.,11below).   The programme for this new nozzle is extremely tightand could lead to the certificate of airworthiness beingdelayed beyond mid-1974-o/Payload- 2 -
Payload/Range Performance9.     In November officials considered that improvements tothe propulsion system then under active development by the firms could lead to a payload at entry into service of16,000 lb to 17,000 lb which together with minor changes inairline regularity and operating conditions should allow the target payload on initial entry into service for the Paris/New York design mission of 20,000 lb to be achieved.,   A newnozzle (see paragraph 11 below) was considered necessary to assure the target payload of 25,000 lb two years after entry into serviceo10o   Polls Royce are at present reluctant to guarantee an improved engine performance at entry into service.    If the performance at entry into service in fact proves no betterthan Rolls Royce are at present willing to guarantee, thenofficials1 present assessment of payload at entry into service falls to 14,500 lb.   Officials now have a high degree of confidence that the engine performance promised byRolls Royce at entry into service can be achieved.,        Officialshowever consider that the target payload of 20,0001b  at entry into service can still be met by the introduction of the newnozzle which could give an increase of payload 3,500 lb to4,000 lb and by a small change which is expected to be acceptable to the regulatory authorities in the speed atwhich the aircraft should hold over airports.   Officialsconsider that with this new nozzle and change in holdingprocedure the target payload of 25,000 lb two years afterentry into service can also be achieved.11.   Preliminary studies last November suggested that a fundamental re-design of the nozzle system would increasepayloads by about 5,000 lb.   Officials now consider on thebasis of experimental work completed since then that thepayload benefit is likely to be between 3,500 lb and 4,000 lb.If Rolls Royce do not increase their guarantee on improvedengine performance at entry into service this new nozzle willbe necessary to achieve the target payload of 20,000 lb atentry into service as well as the target payload of 25,000 lbtwo years later.12.   The firms&apos; provisional estimate of the increase in development costs as a result of the introduction of this new nozzle is  20m of which about  6m would be expenditure at the UK firms.    Officials believe on the evidence available at present that the extra cost is unlikely to be less than 30m.   While there is now a much sounder basis for officials&apos;estimates of the cost and technical benefit of the new nozzle,a number of key experiments need to be completed before amuch better judgment can be made.   It is unlikely that thisjudgment can be made before the end of the year./Officials&apos;- 3 -
13.   Officials&apos; basic estimate of performance is, in theabsence of 11=2 results, subject to considerable uncertainty(I about 8,000 lb)0   This uncertainty will not be significantly reduced until 11=2 results have been assessed.    It is unlikelythat this will now be before the beginning of 1971 -    Officials&apos;present estimates of payload thus cover a bracket which at itshigher end would lead to a conclusion that Concorde will be a technical success but which at the lower end would lend to theconclusion that Concorde would be a technical failure.Airfield Noise14-.   Measurements on the prototype aircraft suggest that:-Approach noise is likely to be about the same as thatof the Boeing 707 or DC 8 aircraft.Lateral noise will almost certainly be higher than thatof existing aircraft - the most likely figure being about PNdB higheroFlyover noise on some days is likely to be 2/3 PNdBabove the levels currently permitted at London andNew York.15-   Work is continuing on improved, silencers and it is hopedthat tests during the remainder of this year will confirmtheir predicted benefits (reduction of about 2PHdB).Officials remain of the view that there is a good chance that these improved silencers will be ready for entry into service.16.   Concorde&apos;s engine noise continues to be a source of concern.   Hopefully, Concorde may at entry into service justscrape inside the existing limits at Heathrow and Kennedy.Any increase in the severity of the existing limits would havea serious effect on the operation of the aircraftoDevelopment Costs17.   In November 1969 the basic development estimate was &apos;727m at October 1969 prices with a contingency of  109mgiving an upper bracket of  836m.    The then Minister of technology informed the House on 26th January that thedevelopment costs were estimated at  730m at October 1969prices.   He made it clear that this estimate excluded the costs of improvements to the propulsion system which were likely to be necessary and that the costs of these improve-ments would be within the margin of 15% of the basic estimate.(In the previous May the Minister had stated in the House that,if further changes beyond the then basic estimate of  730m atJanuary 1969 prices were proposed such as to increase theestimated development cost by more than some 15% the Governmentwould probably be facing a demand for a fundamental re-design of the aircraft)./When
18.   When allowance is made for improvements to the engine,the extension of the date for the certificate of airworthinessuntil mid-1974 and for certain other changes, the basicestimate becomes  755M at October 1969 prices.   Whenconverted to January 1970 prices this becomes  770m.   To thishas to be added the cost of developing the new nozzle whichofficials estimate is unlikely to he less than  30m.    this gives a basic estimate at January 1970 prices of  800m.19-   This estimate contains margins to cover only suchunplanned work as may normally be expected to arise duringthe programme as currently envisaged.    The previous upperbracket of  836m at October 1969 prices is equivalent to 853m at 1970 prices.   Thus the overall contingency has nowbeen reduced to  53m.20.    If results at  1=2 turn out to be significantly better thanofficials currently expect, there is a reasonable prospect of costs being contained within the present upper limit of  853m.If, however, the results prove to be very much as officialspredict, there will still be a number of uncertainties remainingand taking into account the fact that five or six years ofdevelopment remain, some increase in the upper limit is likelyto be necessary.    In the view of UK officials this could be ofthe order of  50m.    In certain circumstances the increase couldbe greater.   Officials will not however have a firm basis onwhich to assess the upper limit until the        tests have shown the extent of what further modifications, if any, need to bemade.Selling Price21.   The firms have proposed that the selling price at January1970 prices should be an average of $24.8m on the basis of a production run of 150.    They have warned that in their view this price is already high (the last figure mentioned toairlines was $21.5m) and the market would not bear significant increase in this price.   However officials&apos; provisional view,subject to discussions with the firms, is that the firms&apos;estimates of production costs are understated by about 10%.- 5 -
22.    If, as is probable, there remains a substantial gap between officials and firms&apos; estimate of what the selling price should be, we will face a difficult situation withthe firms and possible also the French.23. At the Concorde Directing Committee French officials havetaken the line that the two Governments should not fix   the selling price but that this should be left to the commercial judgment of the firms who should be made to bear the consequen-ces if their judgment proves wrongs    The French position is somewhat unreal since their firms are largely under public ownership and any losses on Concorde would ultimately find their way back to the French Government.    If, however, theFrench stick to the line they have taken so far, it will present very real difficulties for us since the onlyproduction financing arrangement the UK firms have so far been prepared to contemplate is one under which HMG would bearany losses that may be incurred.Airline Orders and Commercial Prospects24.    16 airlines have taken out 7^ options for Concorde.They have paid in deposits about  3.5m in. total ( 1.8m to BAC).The options do no more than reserve a place in the deliveryqueue.    The options, which were re-negotiated in Spring 1969,expired at the end of June 1970 and the firms are currentlyvisiting the airlines to negotiate an extension of the options until 31st March 1971 -    If, as officials expect,the results of the flight tests at M^2 cannot be assesseduntil the beginning of 1971, it is unlikely that the firstcontracts with airlines will be signed before April 1971-25.    Other airlines will not order Concorde until BOAC andAir France have done so.   BOAC and Air France therefore hold the key to airline orders.    The attitude of Air France is not known and they will not have completed their assessment of concorde until September.        B.O.A.C.,     however,/are- 6 -
are pessimistic about the effect the introduction of Concordewould have on their profitability. Studies by an outsideconsultant suggest that there are ways in which BOAC couldimprove their financial position by operating Concorde, butBOAC could improve their financial position by operating Concorde,but BOAC consider that these suggestions are impracticable andfirmly maintain that the introduction of Concorde will worsentheir financial position.,   Their latest expenditure forecastsimplied that they would lease Concorde.    There is a strongpossibility that they will refuse to operate Concorde withouta subsidy,26.      Airlines generally are going through a difficultfinancial position and they are finding it difficult to raisecredito   No US airline has ordered any more of the big newsubsonic aircraft for more than a year.    Estimates of when theposition will ease vary considerably but it is generally agreedthat capital for further aircraft purchases will be difficultto obtain for a considerable time to come and that interest rates will be high. In this financial situation, US airlineswould appear to be thinking in terms of only ordering theminimum number of aircraft necessary to maintain their competitive position.   Eastern Airlines have decided to renew their option but have said they will need less   than six aircraft.   AmericanAirlines expect to renew their! option but do not envisage alarge fleet.    TWA consider they will is&amp;re to buy a few ifConcorde enters service with PanAm.   United consider that theroutes on which they could use Concorde look unattractivebecause the traffic is almost wholly tourist with an increasingemphasis on group and promotional fares but will probably renewtheir option as a defensive measure,   PanAm believe the advent of SST operations to be premature but accept that they mightbe forced to order Concorde if BOAC and Air France did,27,       Before these views of airlines were obtained, officialsattempted to assess Concorde&apos;s overall commercial prospects.Mr. Wedgweod Benn agreed when he met M, Mondon last december that officials should up-date a report made in 1967 by aCommittee of British and French officials, known as the ConcordeEcogom^c^Prospects Committee (CEPC). The Committee reported -at the28.       There is reasonably close agreement between the UK andFrench Members of the Committee on the likely range of salesat a price of $28m in January 1970 prices UK members of theCommittee estimate that the range of possible sales is between 50-150 and the French Members 85-155,    The UK Members,however, consider that the balance of probabilities is thatsales are more likely to be within the lower end of the rangei,e. 50-100 while the French Members believe that the most likely level of sales will be about 130./29.   Both the
29o   Both the UK and French Members of the Committee are agreed that there is no prospect of recovering any of the 4-80m the two countries will have spent or committed by30th June,    They are also ageed that only a proportion,depending on the numher of sales, of the expenditure out-standing after 30th June will be recovered,30c       The foreign exchange benefits and implied preferencesfor the UK associated with the various estimates are asfollows:-- 8 -

It should be noted that -these calculations take no accountof costs rising beyond the present upper limit of  853m orthe possibility that it may not be possible to realise aselling price of 028m in which case the losses would be greater than those indicated above.Production Programme31.   The firms currently have authority to continuemanufacture of the first 6 production aircraft (of which thefirst three - and possibly the fourth - will be used in the flight test programme) until September 1970-    Authority hasalso been given up to September 1970 to order long-datedmaterials for aircraft 7-10 and to order materials for an initial batch of production engines.   Matching engineauthorisations have also been given.32.   According to the production programme to which the firms have been working, authority to start manufacture of aircraft 7-10 and to order materials for the next batch of aircraft (Nos.11-16) should have been given at the end of June1970.   Officials recommend, however, that these furtherauthorities should not be given to the firms before anumber of flights at M=2 have been achieved.Production Financing33*   Phe Industrial Expansion Act provides for the Governmentto loan or guarantee  125m to finance Concorde production.It was estimated for the last Public Expenditure SurveyReview that to finance 150 aircraft programme the Governmentwould need to lend  160m and the Banks provide against government guarantees a further  25m.   This estimate is currently being re-assessed in the light of the changes tothe production programmes.34.   Terms for financing production have not yet beenagreed with BAC or Rolls Royce.   Production is at present being financed under direct contract from the Department.BAC and Rolls Royce have so far rejected any scheme whichwould leave them with a risk of loss on the grounds that therisk is too large and that, since Concorde is a jointproject, they are not in full control of the situation.The only scheme which seems to be negotiable is one in whichthe companies would receive a minimum return on capital employed, although one substantially below the standardnon-risk rate for Government contracts, even if theparticular aircraft batch or production programme as a wholeresulted in a loss to the Government./The present- 10 -
The present financial position35.   The UK share of the present basic estimate of Concordeextramural development cost of  800m at January 1970 price is  394m, of which about  230m had been spent by June 30th 1970,If  Concorde were cancelled additional cancellation costs wouldprobably amount to between  20m and  30m,,   Assuming no furtherescalation on the basic estimate cancellation on June 30thwould therefore have implied a saving of about  135/145m, towhich should be added about  15m of outstanding intramuraland other miscellaneous development costs.   The breakdown ofthis saving by years would be as follows:1970/1C3-) 1971/2   1972/5   1975/4     1974/5   1975/6   Later years/12 47 35 24 18 12 12(l)   assumes all cancellation costs fall in 1970/136.   In addition to meeting the cost of development, theGovernment will also be responsible for lending or guaranteeingthe working capital necessary to finance production.Expenditure to June 30th 1970 totalled about  12m, and thenet calls on Government funds (i.e. the cost of productionnet of forecast receipts and excluding sums guaranteed by theGovernment but provided from outside sources) are expected onthe latest estimates available to fall as follows:1970/1^   1971/2   1972/5   1975/4   1974/512 29 51 48 12(l)    expenditure from 30.6.70 only37&quot;    II we continue to March 31st 1971 we shall incur afurther  35m on extramural development plus  3/4m onintramural development and about  10m on production: say 50m in all.16 July 1970
