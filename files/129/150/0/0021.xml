BAC 3-11 AIRCRAFTNote by the Minister of technology. The Cabinet will wish to know about the proposal for the BAC 3-11aircraft and its P*nicholls-Royce engine,2,        This project is one of great importance and both the British aircraft corporation (BAG) and Rolls-Royce are pressing for a very early decision,BAC have spent some  3 million of their own money already, and will notbe able to hold their dates unless they now sharply increase their rate of spending.    They are being pressed to enter into firm, commitments withsub-contractors here and overseas.   At Rolls-Royce, continued uncertainty about Her MajestyTs Governments support for their next round of civilengine development places their whole future in doubt.    Meanwhile british european Airways are also wanting early confirmation that they can have this aircraft.3. I believe the BAC 3-11 to be a sound and worthwhile economic projectquite apart from its importance for other reasons.    I appreciate thedifficulties of an immediate decision to support the BAC 3-11 before we havedecided what savings are possible elsewhere but I hope that Cabinet will agree that I should discuss these proposals with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and other colleagues concerned with a view to decisions beingtaken as soon as possible.G RMinistry of Technology SW120 July 1970t&apos; .1CP(70)21 COPY NO20 July 1970CABINET
iuWEXBAC 3-11 AND RB211This paper discussed the case for Government financial support of the BAC 3-11 aircraft and of a Rolls-Royceengine for it.   The BAC 3-11 would be a short to mediumrange wide-bodied aircraft designed to carry 200-300passengers over stages of up to 2,000 miles .     Its twoengines (RB211-61) would be a stretched version ofthe RB211-22 which is currently being developed forthe Lockheed trijet.Launching aid and economic appraisal2o     The sums involved (at March 1970 price levels)are as follows    ( M):-Total ^ BUGLaunching LaunchingCost &quot;Aid soughtAircraft             140 84 (60%)Engine                  60 42 (70%)(EB211-61)_____ -___m__200 126(63%)These are gross figures and do not take account ofany taxation or investment allowance effects.3o     Further expenditure of perhaps  10M on an improved version of the aircraft would be necessaryin due course, but Government aid is not nowrequested or in any way committed.   The RB211-61might also be sold to Lockheed for a stretchedversion of their trivet (see paragraph 13. below).Further expenditure of  10M would be involved,of which we should be asked to find  7M.4.     Government payments (including the  7M for thepossible Lockheed application) would be phasedroughly as follows (in  M)1970/71   71/72   72/73   75/74   74/75   75/76    Total4 23       33      37       25       11 133/ 5 **   00
5o     The manufacturers and the Ministry of Technologyhave carried out a careful analysis of the marketprospects for the aircraft and we have based theeconomic appraisal on sales ranging between 150 and240 aircraft.   It is not expected that sales will falllower than 150 (BEA and the other airlines who areprepared to order at the outset as &quot;launchingcustomers&quot; would order some 40 aircraft initiallyand require about 100 in total), and there is somechance (eg if BAC gained an American partner) thatsales would exceed 240.      BAC are already planning to sub-contract parts of the aircraft overseas to canada, Belgium, Rumania, and Jugoslavia and thisshould improve the prospects of orders from nationalairlines.     The sales forecast assumes that the americans will capture some 700 of a total world marketof about 1100; no American manufacturer has yetentered the field and all three are in some financialdifficultyo   Sales of 240 for the BAC 3-11 would represent some 22% of the world market.     this compares with nearly 20% captured by the BAC 111against competition from Boeing and Douglas06.     The results of the economic appraisal of the project are set out below in terms of the &quot;impliedpreference&quot; (i.e. the percentage by which thenational resources used exceed the foreign exchangebenefit) and the &quot;implied subsidy&quot; (i.e. the prospective Government   loss as a percentage ofthe foreign exchange benefit)?      The figures in the bottom line of the table take account of the factthat many of the aircraft will be exported on long-term credit backed by ECGD;   the low rate of interestwe normally charge represents a further &quot;impliedpreference&quot;.     This is, however, a feature common to many capital goods exports:/(a) ..*U0TE.   All expenditure and receipts arediscounted at 10% per annum togive a net present value in 1970*10% is chosen as the target or&quot;test discount rate&quot; as representingthe amount which industry would expect to earn (after tax) on a normal investment.   Hence, forexample, a zero implied preferencewould mean that the project wasearning this 10%.-2-

If we inflate faster than our competitors(mainly America), profitability will again sufferbut this would be a national problem affecting all exports.   At the extreme, these various effectsmight cause a swing of 10 points either way inthe implied preference so that the figures in line (e) could vary between:-At 150 sales   At 240 salesImplied preference      12-32% 0-19%(the implied subsidy remains unaffected).8.     The Ministry of Technology believes, inthe light of the technical work which has alreadybeen done on the aircraft, and the thoroughanalysis of costs and sales prospects, thatjudgment can reasonably be based on the impliedpreference figures in paragraph 6 above.9.     If the EB211-61 was also sold to Lockheed, theresults would be substantially improved (see FullTable at Appendix).The European Airbus A500B10.   The aircraft would b&quot; in direct competition with the European Airbus, A300B, from which we withdrew in 1969 but which the French and/Germans ..-3-
Germans are continuing,   with private participation byHawker Siddeley, and the sales forecasts allow for &quot;this,as well as.-for an American competitor.11.   We withdrew from the A300B because there was at the time no assurance of airline interest, insufficientfinancial participation by industry, and doubts aboutthe effectiveness of French project management.   these objections remain valid and, even if it were feasiblefor us to do so, it would not be in our interest toattempt to re-enter the A300B.   There would, inparticular, be no prospect that the stretched EB211could be established as the prime engine for the aircraft- Rolls-Royce&apos;s dates are too late, and the French have in any case shown a strong preference for its Americanrival, the General Electric CF.6.12.    It is not yet certain that the French will fund the A3OOB to completion, since they have a rivalDassault project (the 150 seat Mercure) and are heavilystretched in other directions;   but they and the Germanscan be expected to protest vigorously if we decide to launch the BAC3-1&apos;1o   However, on their own world marketforecasts (of 1200-1400 aircraft) there is room for bothprojects, and if we consider that the BAC 3^1 is in thenational interest it would be wrong to abandon it in the face of pressure from foreign competitors.   Whatever we decide about the BAC 3-11, it need not be regarded as a major factorjf in our approach to Europe or in the longer term prospects of aircraft collaboration forwhich we should continue to work.Lockheed requirement13.   We shall probably not know until late this year or early next whether Lockheed want the RB211-61 enginefor a stretched version of their trijet;    in any case it would almost certainly not be economic to launch the engine for Lockheed alone (though not to launch underthese circumstances might cause Lockheed to turn to an american engine and worsen sales of the present RB211).A decision about the engine/must- 4 -
must therefore he taken now, in the BAC 311 context.If Lockheed&apos;s present cash difficulties (which arise out of losses on military contracts) grow anyworse, sales of the present trijet and RB211 maywell suffer.   Sales of the engine in the BAC 3-11will then he of cardinal importance for Rolls-Royce1sfuture in the civil aero-engine field.14.    BEA want this aircraft and judge that itsoperating costs (in terms of seat-miles) will be some5% better than the Lockheed trijet which would be their second choice, allowing an overall saving tothe airline of some  1-jM per year.   On present showing,they \would be reluctant to buy the A300B.15.   BEA&apos;s initial purchase would be 20 and fullrequirement for the BAC 3-11 and any stretchedversion perhaps 60.   If the Lockheed trijet werepurchased instead, the dollar bill in the decade or so after 1974 is likely to be about  400M (this istaken account of in the economic assessment at paragraph 6 above).16.    In addition to the BEA initial order, BACbelieve that they can get about 20 launching orders fromother smaller airlines here and in Europe.    Theultimate requirement of the airlines thus committedwould probably be around 100 aircraft.   Althoughit would be better if a major American airlinewere included among the first customers, ordersfor 40 would represent an adequate basis for launchingthe aircraft.     It is better than European aircraftfirms have achieved in the past, and comparesfavourably with US practice.The arguments for and against17.   Given the public expenditure involved, thisis a difficult decision.   The case for supporting the bac 3-11 can be summarised as follows(a)   It represents our best remaining chance toavoid total dependence on America for subsoniccivil transport aircraft.   We ought to retain some capacity to design and build these aircraft, firstly because of the growingexport market (we predict that trafficwill be at least twice as large by 1980as it is now), and secondly because we havea large home market - the largest airlineindustry in the western world outside America./(b) ..-5-
(b) It allows us to exploit the very goodworldwide reputation which BAC and Rolls-Royce have built up over the years withthe Viscount, VC.10 and BAC 111.     the combined civil export earnings 01 thetwo companies during the last 5 years has been  400M.(c) It will substantially reduce the industrialdifficulties involved if for any reason the Concorde is discontinued.(d) We cannot afford to become subservientto the French and German industries in any european collaborative set-up.(e) BEA want it.(f) A major aircraft operating on worldairline routes is a good demonstration of our technological abilities and, assuch, will indirectly help otherengineering exports.(g) Directly, it will help our aircraft equipment industry to achieve sales inforeign aircraft.(h) Large sub-contracts are expected to goto Shorts in Northern Ireland and to scottish Aviation at Prestwick.Against this can be set the following points:(a) the high, government expenditure involved;(b) the risk that costs will increase and thatthe project will fail to come up toexpectations.But the firms will be under an incentive to hold costs down since theywill have to bear their share (40% inthe case of BAC and 30% in the case of rolls-Royce), and will be contractuallyresponsible for cost over-runs./Technical .
Technical failure is unlikely since the design of the aircraft is already well established as a result of the last two yearswork by BAC.     They have a very experiencedcivil aircraft team, and have proved themselvesin their BAC 111, as xd.th the Viscount earlier,able to sell aircraft throughout the world;(c) it will temporarily exacerbate relations withthe French and Germans.,However, though it is disappointing thatwe did not find a basis for collaboration ona European airbus,   it was not for want of trying,and we should earn no respect for a show of weakness now in the face of their protests;(d) civil aircraft launching aid (altogetherapart from the large sums spent on Concorde)has been a constant drain on the Exchequer,,Since 1960, we have spent or committed  120Mand have recovered so far only  6M.However, the policy did have certain other objectives - notably, to keep BEAflying British with the Trident 5B andBAC 111/500 - and it has led to dollar earningor dollar-saving sales worth some  800Mwith more to come.,(e) Equally good export earning or import saving uses could be found for the resourcesinvolved which would make no call on government aid.But we cannot be sure about this0Aircraft is one of the advanced technologyindustries on which our exports mustsurely increasingly depend.   There are no immediate alternative projects for Rolls-Royceand BAC.   The BAC 5-11 would help theaircraft industry to maintain its exports,now running at the rate of some  500M per year.19o   There is a further more general pointoLaunching aid for approved projects should not normallyexceed 50% to ensure an adequate commercial stake.Neither BAC nor Rolls-Royce are prepared to find 50%,Rolls-Royce because they cannot afford it (they are having to spend some  70M of their own money on the basic RB211; and BAC because they are not preparedto increase their launching cost risk beyond  56M(40%), which is of course a very large sum in absolute terms for a private company.     In fact, BAC predict/that ..eowFrefewiAL
that &quot;by 1975, taking account of production workin progress, they will have in all some  6CM of theirown capital tied up in the project, and that this will rise to a peak of  75M in 1980.20o    The contributions which, the firms now proposeare the result of long negotiations, and it wouldnot be realistic to expect them to find more.Company Finances21o   Since BAC and Rolls-Royce will be responsiblenot only for their share of launching costs, but also for cost overruns and for production, we have been concerned to ens .re that both companies have sufficientfinancial strength to undertake the project*-8-
22 ,   BAC are at present under-capitalised in relationto the level of business proposed; they have now putforward proposals for an increase of  6M in their capital hy a private placing of loan stocks.   We must ensure that this sum, at least, is available before webecome publicly committed to the project.    Though BACare seeking 60% launching aid, they want 75% progresspayments in the early years (with correspondinglylower payments later) to ease their cash position.This is a point which can be left to the normal courseof negotiation.23.    Rolls-Royce have been facing a major cashshortage and a decline in profitability, owing in large part to difficulties with the basic RB.211engine for Lockheed, which will cost the companysome  7011 in launching cost contributions instead ofthe  20M originally budgeted for.    The difficulties should be resolved when RB.211 deliveries get underway (provided the Lockheed trijet is not scrapped -see below).    To tide over the next few years, theIRC is making loans of up to  20M available, and has agreed with Rolls-Royce certain measures to improve their commercial performance.    In addition, becauseof the difficult cash situation (which they expectuntil about 1973), Rolls-Royce are asking that the70% Government contribution to launching costsshould be made first, and payment of their 30% sharedeferred until 1973 and 1974.   They further ask that,if their profits in those years fall below a definedlevel, this 30% payment should be further deferred.While this is unwelcome, it is clear that Rolls-Roycecannot at present afford to offer anything better;the 1958-59 concurs in this judgment.24     Within these limits, Rolls-Royce and BAC havethe resources to carry out the project, given theamount of Government aid now proposed, and to carry the usual responsibility for cost over-runs.    Butthere is little room for mistakes./25- If
2p,    If Lockheed fail, or are forced ultimately to drop their trijet, there will be no immediate outlet for the EBo211-22 engine, on which Rolls-Royce andwe are spending so much, money.    Under these circumstances,the expected improvement in Rolls-Royce finances wouldnot appear, and they would regard it as even moreimportant to sell the RB.211-61 in the BAC 3-11.26,    We have thus a difficult background for thedecision which, is now required.    In neither B1C norRolls-Royce is the situation wholly satisfactory,and major difficulties or cost over-runs could leadto further requests for Government support.    In a sense, this is unavoidable in a project of suchmagnitude; the sums of money involved are beyond theresources of private industry.    Even in America, theaircraft companies are able to finance civil aircraftonly on the back of massive military and space contracts.Escalation27.    The inclusion of an escalation clause inlaunching aid contracts is a new feature.    In thepast, we have preferred to tie launching aid to a fixed or maximum sum, including an allowance forescalation estimated in advance and within which the firm has to live.    It now seer:.s best to concede anescalation clause, strictly tied to official indicesof labour and materials.   This will obviate the needfor a large contingency allowance now, and will (mostimportantly) enable us to tie our levy to actualsales prices which should benefit from the effects of inflation.   An escalation clause will not leavefirms free to concede exaggerated wages.    They will still remain liable for their share of launchingcost, and they will remain under the strongestincentive to avoid increases in their production costs.- 10 -
Labour Implications28 .   BACs present total labour force is about37,000.   The firm estimate that the BAC 3-31 willoccupy some 2,500 of their employees by the endof 1971, rising to a peak of about 9,000 by the mid 1970&apos;so29.   Rolls-Royce&apos;s present total labour force onaero-engines is about 70,000.   The RB211-22 willemploy some 20,000 people at peak in 1971-   TheRB211-61 will employ some 1,200 by the end of1971 rising to 9-15,000 (depending on whetherLockheed order as well as BAC) by the mid-1970&apos;s.50.   Employment in firms other than BAC and Rolls-Royce would be about as much again.Conclusion31 .   A decision is now required whether Governmentlaunching aid of  126M should be committed to the bac 311 aircraft and its engine.   BAC need a decisionimmediately.    They had hoped for a decision earlythis year, hut engine and other uncertainties outside their control did not allow this.   They are. nowspending more than  j-M per month and are unwilling to continue this for many weeks longer.    But they ought now to increase their spending and enter intofirm commitments with foreign partners and sub-contractors, otherwise the aircraft will miss BEAdates and the best of the overseas market.32 .   The RB211-61 engine may also be required byLockheed to power later versions of their trijet,so that we may be faced early next year with a request to support it even if we do not go ahead with the bac 511.20    July 1970- 11 -

20th July, 1970iCost overruns may be offset by increases in selling pries?   Theextent to which this can be done depends on the competitive situationbut there is usually some room for manoevre once the aircraft orengine has established itself.    In the judgment of the Ministry of technology the net variation of costs and receipts for a given levelof sales is unlikely to exceed ^5% of the agreed estimates.A rate of inflation in excess of escalation in competing countries could also upset the forecast of profitability.   British costs in money;erms would then rise in circumstances where the ability to increase prices would be limited by competition.    This problem is shared withother industries which depend on heavy initial investment for a long-term pay off.These two effects combined could vary the implied preferencewithin 10% either way, so that (for example) 150 sales of the BAC 3-Hcould mean an implied preference varying between 12% and 32%.   But22% has been adopted as a reasonably conservative, and most probable,result.
