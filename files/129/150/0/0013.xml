CP(70) 13 COPY NO      3915 July 1970CABINETPAY OF THE HIGHER CIVIL SERVICE: TENTH REPORTOF THE STANDING ADVISORY committee memorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductionAt the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy on 13 July I was invited to circulate in readiness for discussion by theCabinet a memorandum which would restate my recommendations fordealing with the Tenth Report of the Standing Advisory Committee onthe Pay of the Higher Civil Service (chaired by Lord Plowden) and whichwould set out in some detail the implications of the course I recommendfor the pay of other highly paid groups in the public sector.The Plowden report.     The background to the present report is set out in the note at annex A and a copy of the report is at Annex B.     My recommendations for dealing with the report are as follows s-(a) We should extend to the Assistant Secretary and equivalentgrades the central pay increase of 8f per cent paid to lower grades on 1 April 1970 and from the same date.(b) While there is a strong case for implementation at once of thebalance of the increases recommended by the Committee inits Ninth Report last summer, Stage II of the increases should be paid on 1 July 1970 (as announced earlier by theprevious Government) and Stage III on 1 January 1971.Meanwhile Under-Secretaries should receive an increaseof 84 per cent on 1 July 1970 instead of the increase of6. 2 per cent due under Stage II (and Stage III should be adjusted accordingly in their case).3.     The proposal at (a) above presents no difficulties.    Theapplication of central pay increases to the Assistant Secretary grade hasbean customary in the past and is in effect an inevitable consequential ofthe central pay settlement itself for which the Plowden Committee&apos;sendorsement is no more than a formality.1
4,     For more senior grades the Committee urges immediateimplementation of the balance of the increases recommended in theirreport last year.    These increases were substantial but were regarded by the Committee as meeting &quot;minimum standards&quot; of comparability inthe circumstances of mid-1969 and reflected the extent to which the pay of the Higher Civil Service had fallen behind outside rates.    Since thensalary levels elsewhere have, of course, moved further ahead.    If werefuse to implement the balance of the increases at a reasonably earlydate we shall merely postpone a problem which will have to be facedsooner or later and will give rise to serious doubts about our readiness to honour the principle of &quot;fair comparison&quot; for Higher Civil Service pay.In addition undue deferment will maintain the distortion of internalrelativities (which will worsen as time passes) and will have a permanent and quite severe effect in relation to the pensions of those retiring or about to retire,    I am convinced that our treatment of this issue will be widelyregarded within the Civil Service as a whole as a test case of our intentions and that in face of the Plowden Committee^ two recent reportsit is essential for us tc accept implementation in full of the increases recommended last year,    I believe that there is in fact a good case for bringing both Stage II and Stage III into effect from 1 July 1970.    But I accept that this might create serious problems for us elsewhere on thewages front.    I therefore propose that implementation of Stage IIIshould be deferred to 1 January 1971.5.     While the Plowden Committee suggested the payment of 8-g- per cent to Under-Secretaries as an alternative if Stage III were not implemented&quot;on 1 July 1970 or at any early date thereafter (not later than the end of1970)&quot; I recommend that an increase of 8\ per cent should replace the stage II increase of 6. 2 per cent due for Under &quot;Secretaries on1 July 1970.    To withhold this, while implementing Stage III at the latestpossible date which might justify this according to the Plowden Committee,would lead to further distortion of internal relativities and would, for the sake of withholding a marginal improvement of 2. 3 per cent, seriouslyimpair our chances of persuading the Staff Side to accept our decisionsbecause of the traditional entitlement of Under-Secretaries to central pay increases.6. :   It is important for us to reach early decisions on the Committeelsrecommendations so that we can release the report and make known our decisions on it before the Parliamentary Recess.    The Staff Side havereceived copies of the report on a confidential basis and pressure to publish it will quickly develop.7.     The meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on13 July was disposed in principle to accept my recommendations fordealing with the Plowden Report but it was suggested that furtherconsideration should be given to their possible repercussions on the pay of other highly paid public sector groups.2
8.     A decision to implement Plowden Stage III for the Higher CivilService from 1 January 1971 will have implications for a number ofother groups.    In some cases it may be preferable to defer decisions onthese until we have decided whether there should be some independentmachinery to review politically sensitive top salaries,(a) National Health Service (NHS) administrative &quot;designated&quot;grades (3, 000).    This group has a link at the top with thehigher civil service (Under-Secretary/Assistant Secretarylevel) and at the bottom with the Civil Service Higher executive officer.    Both these link points will move from 1 January next,and there will thus be consequential increases for the NHSgroup? the amount of the lower civil service increases depends on the outcome of pay research, but the percentage for Under-Secretaries at Stage III will be about 4 per cent.(b) Lower judiciary (400).    These again have established links with Higher Civil Service scales at around Under-Secretarylevel, so that they would receive increases in the region of4 per cent from 1 January next,(c) Nationalised industry board chairmen and members (120).The recommendations in the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) Report No. 107 on the salaries of the chairmen and members of nationalised industry boards wereclosely parallel with those in last year*s Plowden committee report, which was partly based on the same evidence.    Therecommendations were to be put into effect in three stages,of which the first two have been implemented from April 1969and April this year.     In these circumstances I believe that itwould be difficult for the Government to avoid implementingStage III for nationalised industry boards, either on 1 Januarynext or possibly on 1 October (reflecting the fact that the operative dates for Stages I and II were 3 months earlier than for the Higher Civil Service),     My own view is that thesensible course would be to go for a common date, e. 1 January.    This would involve an addition of around9 per cent, costing the nationalised industries some  100,000.(d) Higher judiciary (120).    The judges had a 15 per cent increase from 29 May, roughly corresponding with Stage I for theHigher Civil Service.    As the annexed table (Annex C) shows,the salaries of High Court judges have kept a fairly closerelationship with those of Permanent Secretaries in the past,although there has been no precise pay link.    Judges&apos; pay has never been reviewed by an independent body, but under theprevious Administration the judges agreed that theii . ealasrfcssshould be looked at by the proposed Special Panel of theCommission for Industry and Manpower.    I have no doubt that
judgesr pay cannot be left as it is after Stage III has been implemented for the Higher Civil Service.    It is forconsideration whether we should aim to settle this very quicklyby means of an internal review and a Government decision onrates roughly in line with those of the Higher Civil Service, orwhether we should set up some hide pendent machinery whichcould review these and other top salaries of a politicallysensitive kind.(e) Senior Service Officers  (800).    The highest Service ranks weregiven varying but substantial percentage increases in salary aspart of the NBPI review of Service pay, which was put intoeffect from 1 April this year.    NBPI said in their Report No. 142that these rates took some account of current pay levels in theHigher Civil Service, having regard to the fact that uin the past the Government, in determining pay for senior officers, has hadthe pay of Higher Civil Servants in mind, though the relationshipdoes not appear to have been made explicit&quot;;  this relationshipis shown, at the General/ Permanent Secretary level, in the annexed table.    But the Board said that the figures which theyhad &quot;arbitrarily chosen&quot; were primarily to maintain reasonabledifferentials between ranks, and that they intended to review theposition in two years&apos; time.    At that date the Plowdenrecommendations were already known, but it was subsequentlydecided that senior Service officers should not have to wait thefull two years before their next increase, but should be included among the groups to be reviewed by the Commission for Industryand Manpower Special Panel.    Thus once again, as for judges,there is no link with the Higher Civil Service which makes it possible to assess the amount of the consequential increases which would be justified in the light of the government&apos;s decision to implement Stage III for the Higher Civil service from 1 January0    However, given the existing standingreference of Service pay to the National Board for Prices and incomes, it would be reasonable to ask the Board to undertakean early review of these salaries, in the light of the CivilService increase.(f) Ministers and Members of Parliament.    There is no doubtthat a Government decision to implement Stage III on1 January will increase the pressure to review MPs1 salaries;in the past a number of Members have pressed for a definitepay link with the Higher Civil Service.    But there are cleardifficulties in the way of any ad hoc review of these salaries bythe Government itself.    I therefore think a decision on this must await our further consideration of future machinery for reviewing top public service salaries generally.
9. To sum up, my views on the main repercussions from theproposals I have made about Higher Civil Service salaries are asfollows(i)   We should accept the direct consequential increases forNHS administrators and the lower judiciary; these are relatively minor changes which would not need to be mentioned in the announcement,(ii)   The Stage III rates for the chairmen and members of nationalised industry boards should be implementedfrom 1 January 1971; and this decision should be announced at the same time as the correspondingdecision for the Higher Civil Service.(iii) The judges should be told that the Government agrees toa review of their pay in the light of these decisions,either hy a new independent body if this can be set up inreasonable time or failing this by some ad hoc inter-departmental body reporting in the near future to ministers.(iv) Similarly, senior Service officers should be told thatthe NBPI will be asked to carry out an early reviewof their pay, in the light of the changes for the higher civil Service, under the standing reference of service pay.(v)   As to the salaries of Ministers and Members of Parliamentwe must seek to reach an early decision on newindependent machinery for reviewing these and othersensitive top salaries in the future.Conclusion10. I invite my colleagues to endorse the conclusions of the economic policy Committee, as follows:-(a) Assistant Secretaries and equivalent grades should receivethe central pay increase of 8j per cent from 1 April 1970,(b) As announced, Stage II 6hould be paid from 1 July 1970, withthe exception that Under-Secretaries should receive anincrease of 8f per cent instead of the Stage II rate.(c) Stage ITI should be implemented in full for all grades on1 January 1971.(d) These decisions should be announced before the Recess.11.    I also invite my colleagues to agree that we should deal with theconsequences for other groups on the lines proposed in paragraph 9immediately above.J civil  Service Department SWl15 July 1970 ccruET   5
ANNEX APAY OP THE HIGHER CIVIL SERVICE: BACKGROUND TO THE10TH REPORT OF THE STANDING .ADVISORY COMMITTEEIntroduction1.     On 16 June the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of theHigher Civil Service (under the chairmanship of Lord Plowden)presented its Tenth Report to the then Prime Minister.    The Report(a copy of which is at Annex B) followed notification to theCommittee (in accordance with normal procedures) of the 1970central pay agreement for lower grades within the non-industrial   -Civil Service.The Standing Advisory committee.     The independent Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of theHigher Civil Service was established in February 1957 to advise onthe pay of those grades of the Administrative Class (assistant secretary and above) and equivalent grades in other Classes whoare outside the scope of the Civil Service Arbitration Agreement.In the case of the Assistant Secretary the Committee normally doesno more than endorse the outcome of discussions between the official and Staff Sides on the basis of pay research surveys which areundertaken for the Assistant Secretary grade on the same basis as for more junior grades.    But in the case of Under Secretary, deputy secretary and Permanent Secretary grades the Committee formulatesits own recommendations taking into account salaries in comparableposts outside the Service.3.     The Committee submitted to the Government last summer a majorreport (the Ninth).    On the basis of a careful study of salarylevels outside the Service, the Committee recommended substantial increases in pay for the senior grades within the Higher CivilService which in their view would &quot;do no more than achieve minimum standards of comparability&apos;1 in the circumstances of mid-1969.    they expressed the hope that these increases ,;should be implemented withas little delay as possible&quot;&apos;, but they went on to say that if theGovernment found &quot;it necessary to have regard to the /incomesPollc.y.7 ceiling /of 3i per cent per annum then in force/&quot; and to defer the full increases, they proposed a pattern of stagedincreases over 2 years as set out in the note at AnnexJS). The Committeewent oh to say that the Government should implement the increasesmore rapidly than this if developments in incomes policy allowed.k.     In a statement on 11 July 1969 the previous Government saidthat it was ,;satisfied that the proposed new rates are right inPrinciple and should be implemented when the requirements of incomes policy allow&apos;1.   The Government accepted that the first stage increases recommended by the Committee should be implementedfrom 1 July 1969 and said that &quot;the rest of the increases recommended by the Committee will need to be considered in thelight of the developments in incomes policy over the next twoyears&quot;.   On 25 March 1970 it was announced that the Government1
had decided to implement Stage II of the increases from 1 July 1970but the announcement made no reference to the implementation of stage III.Notification to the Standing Advisory Committee of the 1970Central Pay Increase5.     In accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon the Civil Service 1953-55 the primary factor in determining payin the non-industrial Civil Service is a ,:fair comparison&quot; withthe rates paid for comparable work outside the Civil Service.    Themain Civil Service pay negotiations are therefore based on detailedevidence of the pay and related conditions of functionallycomparable posts in outside employment.    In order to prevent civilservants lagging too far behind outside rates of pay during the interval between these negotiations, annual interim increases,called central pay increases, have been negotiated in respect ofcivil servants not covered by pay research negotiations in theyear in question.6.     The 1965 Report of the Standing Advisory Committee (thenchaired by Lord Franks) recommended (in line with proposals by theOfficial Side) that &quot;Higher Civil Service grades up to and including the Under Secretary should in future receive the equivalent of central pay increases.   We recommend that in futurecentral pay increases should be reported to us on the understandingthat when central pay increases are received by Principals, weshall normally recommend similar increases for grades in theHigher Civil Service whose fixed rates or scale maximum do notexceed the Under Secretary ratei;.7.     In line with agreed practice, therefore, the Official and staff Sides submitted a joint memorandum to the Committee onUi April 1970 giving the details of the 8-g- per cent central pay settlement concluded the previous month and also reporting  ,factually on the Government&apos;s implementation of Stages I and ii of the 1969 Plowden increases.    The National Staff Side submitted a separate memorandum expressing their dissatisfaction over theGovernments failure to implement in full the 1969 increases andinviting the Committee to recommend the extension to grades up toand including the Under Secretary of a pay increase equivalent tothe central pay increase of 8-g- per cent applicable to Principalsfrom 1 April 1970 and from the same date.Tenth Report of the Standing Advisory committee.     The Report&apos;s main substantive recommendations are asfollows: -(a) the extension to the Assistant Secretary and similargrades at that level of the 81- per cent central pay increase with effect from 1 april(b) the implementation of Stage III of the Committee&apos;s 1969recommendations &quot;at the earliest possible date&quot;.    If this were done, either on 1 July or at an early date thereafter
(not later than end of 1970), the grades up to and includingUnder Secretary should not on this occasion receive alsothe 8-g- per cent central pay increase.    In that event theCommittee propose to take account of the central pay increasewhen they next consider Higher Civil Service pay in 1971;(c)    if the Stage III increases are not implemented on1 July 1970, or at an early date thereafter, then from1 July 1970 the Stage II increases for the Under Secretary(and related grades) should he replaced by new amountsrepresenting 8-g- per cent increase &quot;on the Stage I figures(as opposed to the 6.2 per cent increase on the Stage I raterepresented by Stage II).[    Staff Side AttitudeI   9.     There has been growing impatience at the effect of the timelag which is built into the Civil Service pay system;    the recenthigh level of wage increases generally which has naturally under-lined this.   For more junior grades the 1970 central pay settlement(which was comparatively generous by previous standards) and anagreement to move to a two-year instead of a three-year pay researchcycle have gone some way to improve the atmosphere and to combatgrowing militancy.   The main grievance has been the previousGovernments decision, contrary to the Civil Service pay agreement, to stage pay research increases in two annual instal-ments without retrospection.    The continued staging of the pay increases recommended for the Higher Civil Service last year is widely regarded by the Staff Side as a whole as further evidenceof the Government&apos;s unwillingness to treat its employees fairly.I   11.   The previous Governments ennouncement in March of a decisionto implement on 1 July 1970 Stage II only of the increases recommended last year led to an unprecedented and well-attendedprotest meeting of senior civil servants.    Subsequently, the thenLord Privy Seal saw a delegation from the National Staff Sidewhich pressed for immediate payment of the outstanding 1969increases.    The National Staff Side argue that the rate of pay increases outside the Service has made it impossible to justifycontinued deferment of increases due as a minimum in mid-1969.They are very concerned about the permanent effect of staging onthe pensions of senior civil servants near to retirement, sincepensions in the Civil Service are based on an average of salaryover the three years prior to retirment.    It is clear that the handling of this issue will be regarded as indicative of the newGovernments intentions towards the Civil Service as a whole.3
CONFIDENTIALANN ex 8STAGING ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE PAY OP THE HIGHER CIVIL SERVICETENTH report submitted to the Prime Minister on 16 June 1970IMPLEMENTATION OP OUR NINTH report,    In our Ninth Report, presented on 30 May 1969, we recommended newlevels of salary for the Higher Civil Service at the grade of Under-Secretary and above, and said that they were appropriate in thecircumstances of mid-1969, without any allowance for future developmentsoutside the Civil Service.     However, we thought that the government might find it necessary to consider phased implementation, and for thatpurpose we recommended, with some reluctance, payment in 3 stages, on1 July 1969, 1970 and 1971, expressing the hope that, if anydevelopments in incomes policy made more rapid implementation possible,the Government would act accordingly.     The Government accepted our recommendations in principle, decided upon implementation in stagesand paid the first stage from 1 July 1969.2,    A joint memorandum dated 14 April 1970, which we have receivedfrom the Official and Staff Sides of the National Whitley Council, drewour attention to the Government&apos;s statement of 26 March 1970 which saidthat the second stage of the increases would be paid from 1 July 1970but made no mention of the third stage.     Prom that date, the salaries for the grade of Under-Secretary and above will accordingly be asshown in Column- (2) of the following table:Under-SecretaryDeputy SecretaryPermanent SecretaryHead of the Civil Serviceetc.(1)Current 6,0007,1009,80010,400SALARY RATEST2] -    (3)Prom1 July 1970-6,3758,05011,90012,700Pull Ratesrecommended inNinth Report 6,7509,00014,00015,0003.    We-received a further memorandum from the Staff Side of theNational Whitley Council, on the same date as that mentioned in thepreceding paragraph.     This Staff Side memorandum stated that they weredissatisfied with the Government&apos;s decision to implement from1 July 1970 only the second stage of our Ninth Report&apos;s recommendedincreases and were &quot;pressing the Government to pay the balance of theoverdue increase without further delay&quot;.4.    We explained in our Ninth Report why we attached importance to the   jearliest possible full implementation of our recommendations.     These^were, we thought, the minimum standards for pay in comparison with other ;employments open to individuals of the type at present attaining the
higher levels of the Civil Service.     Failure to pay salaries at these rates might lead to a progressive diminution of the appeal of a CivilService career to the most able individuals:    and the effects of this might, by the time they were apparent, have become irreversible, exceptover a period of many years.     The generally accepted need for greatermobility between the Civil Service and other employments would be hampered unless there was a reasonably close comparison between payrates on the two sides of the exchange.      In addition, the restructuringof the grades in the Higher Civil Service on the lines recommended bythe Pulton Committee required larger differentials between grades in theHigher Civil Service, both to accommodate a new grade structure and toleave room for a system of range pay rather than flat salary rates foreach grade;    and in any event the present differentials seemedinadequate to reward the greater responsibilities of the highest grades.5.    In 1970 the country&apos;s economic circumstances seem in general to bemore satisfactory than in mid-1969.     One doubtful trend is the much higher rate of increase in wages and salaries, acknowledged to someextent as early as last December in the Governments last White paper on Prices, Productivity and Incomes Policy after 1969 (Cmnd 4237), andi&apos;n its abandonment of virtually all statutory controls over incomesincreases.     But this is not in itself a reason for moderating anincrease in pay for the Higher Civil Service, which on grounds of equityand good management we regard as justified, and indeed provides a strong arguement for speeding it up.     We had hoped therefore that theGovernment would have felt able to proceed at once to the full third stage, or at least to improve upon the timetable for paying the second and third stages of our Ninth Reports recommendations.6.    It is for the Government to decide whether it is still essential tomaintain the staging over three years.     However, there are certaindevelopments since last year which give added emphasis to the arguments for earlier implementation.7.    First, the central pay increase for the non-industrial CivilService from 1 April 1970 is in principle (and on the basis of recommendations from the Government and the National Staff Side in 1965)due to be extended to Assistant Secretaries and Under-Secretaries fromthat date.     If it were confined on this occasion to assistant secretaries, the differential between the Assistant Secretary maximumand the Under-Secretary rate (which is at present  800 and which in ourNinth Report, on the basis of 1969 conditions, we recommended should be 1,550) would be reduced on 1 April 1970 to  358.     On 1 July 1970 itwould however, rise to  733, when the rates indicated in Column (2) ofthe table in paragraph 2 above became payable.2 .CONFIDENTIAL
8,    Second, there is to be a Pay Research review for the administrative class, a i &amp; result of which it seems to us very likely that there willbe a further increase from 1 January 1971 for grades up to and includingthe Assistant Secretary, thus compressing a differential which might atthat time already be only  733.9,    There is one further consideration.     The retirement pension fornon-industrial civil servants (including the Higher Civil Service) is calculated as a proportion, depending on length of service, of theaverage salary actually received in the last three years of service.This means that, for all those Higher Civil Servants whose last threeyears include any part of the time since mid-1969 when their pay increases have been staged, there is an absolute and permanent loss ofpension.     These individuals will lose, not only a year&apos;s or two years&apos;increase in pay, but a continuing amount every remaining year of their lives;   since their pensions will not be recalculated when the fullsalaries come into force for those still in employment.10,   For these reasons, we again urge the Government to implement at theearliest possible date the third stage of the recommendations in ourNinth Report,. i.e. to pay the rates shown in Column (3) of the table inparagraph 2 above.APPLICATION TO THE HIGHER CIVIL SERVICE OP THE 1970 CENTRAL PAY increase for THE NON-INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE11.   The Joint Memorandum of 14 April 1970 from the National whitley council also reported the agreement on a central pay increase to be paidto most non-industrial civil servants, either of 6 per cent from1 January 1970 or of 8$ per cent from 1 April 1970.     The National staff side memorandum recalled the recommendation of our Seventh Report (onan agreed proposal by the Government and the Staff Side) that in futurecentral pay increases for grades up to and including the Principal shouldbe reported to us, on the understanding that we would then normallyrecommend similar increases for grades in the Higher Civil Service whosei fixed rates or scale maxima did not exceed the Under-Secretary rate, withI tapering adjustments immediately above that level.I 12,   On this occasion we recommend that Higher Civil Service grades with\ fixed rates or scale maxima not exceeding the maximum of the scale ofI the Assistant Secretary should receive an increase in pay of 8i per centI from 1 April 1970.13.   Under-Secretaries and grades above that level are due to receiveI from 1 July 1970 stage 2 of our Ninth Report &apos;s recommended pay increasesI and in paragraphs 4-10 above we urge the Government to accelerate theI payment of stage 3 of these increases., Government decides to implement14.  We recommend further that, &quot;^W-S^aTincreases either onotage 3 of our Ninth Report &apos;s recommended pay increas       ^ ^Wily 1970 or at an.early date Jhef ^ n^Lr-Secretary should not on thI 1970)   the grades up to and including ^er^ecret.xyoccasion receive also the 8i per cent central pay        reBultB 0f theevent, when considering in the first nan3
Ifoinistrative Class Pay Research review (as mentioned in paragraph 8ibove), we sncuid propose to take into account the 8^ per cent pay increase which would normally have been given this year to Under-Secretaries and tbsir equivalents, and in the light of this to make newRecommendations for the pay of those grades,15, If, however., the Government does not decide at once to implementstage 3 of our Ninth Reports recommended pay increases on 1 July 1970jr at an early date thereafter, then we recommend that from 1 July 1970,for the grades up to and including under-Secretary, the figures foretage 2 of the phased increases proposed in our Ninth Report should bereplaced by new amounts representing an 8-g- per cent increase on the stage 1 figures.     For Under-Secretaries, the amounts would be as followsNinth ReportNew 1 July 1970salary rateStage 1 Stage 2        as now recommended 6,000  6,375  6,510The pay of grades with fixed rates or scale maxima above the level of theInder-Secretary. rate and up to (but not including) the Deputy Secretaryrate should be increased by amounts rising from that of the new increaseiow recommended for Under-Secretaries to that of the stage 2 increase forleputy Secretaries emerging from our Ninth Report.16,  If the Government follow the course recommended in the precedinglaragraph, we should propose in 1971 to consider whether any change isrequired in stage 3 of our Ninth Reports recommended pay increases, for[rades up to and including Under-Secretary.7. It is possible that by the first half of 1971 our functions willLave been transferred to a Special Panel of the proposed Commission for industry and Manpower, which will be concerned with advising thelovernment on the pay of a number of public sector groups including theligher Civil Service.     Should that happen before the review which weisve mentioned in paragraph 8, we assume that the Special Panel willlake account, as appropriate, of the points made in paragraphs 14 to 16,fetch we would wish to commend particularly to their attention.4
