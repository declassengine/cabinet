ANALYSIS AND THE DECISION TAKING PROCESSTHE ROLE OF THE BUSINESS TEAMMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealMy colleagues will be aware of the plans we made over the lastyear or so for the improvement of the decision taking apparatus ofGovernment and the management of Government activities, involving the use of selected businessmen,    The object of this paper is to informthe Cabinet of the action that has been tak^n since we came into officeto put these plans into practice.2.     Mr. R. A. Meyjes, from Shell International, has joined us to bethe head of a small high-powered group of businessmen.    At the outset,they will act as a team of consultants, led by him, available to carry outinvestigations and studies in a wide variety of areas of Governmentactivity.    They will report to the Lord Privy Seal and will be based in theCivil Service Department, which will provide them with staff support, but their services will be at the disposal of any Minister or Department,Their work will be directed by a small committee of Ministers, which thePrime Minister has agreed to chair.    Its title will be the Manageire ntProjects Committee and its terms of reference will be j-&quot;To receive and where appropriate initiate proposals(including those of the business teams) for individualproject studies directed to the improvement of theGovernments decision-making process and of themanagement of Government activities; to authorisesuch studies; to receive reports arising from them,and to decide upon and supervise their implementation.Ministers concerned with particular projects will be invited to attend meetings of the committee in the usual way.   At a later stage, when asa result of a particular study changes in some part of the machinery ofGovernment or the management of a Governmental activity are decided upon, individual members of the team can be detached in order to assist in the process of implementation.-1CP(70) 11 COPY NO    5i14th July 1970CABINET
3,     The first project to be undertaken by the business team hasalready been authorised.    This is to study, together with the relevantofficials in the public sector group of the Treasury, ways and means of improving the analytical capability of that group in its analysis of public sector expenditure programmes.    The work will at first be directed towards relating costs and policy objectives more closely than has beendone hitherto in particular instances, and will necessarily involve ajoint effort with the Department concerned in each particular case.While the aim in the longer term will be the application of thesetechniques more generally, the scarcity of the resources of skilledmanpower needed to bring it about is such that early results will probablyneed to come from selecting particular areas of expenditure for aconcentrated analytical approach.4.     This work is of fundamental importance to the improvement ofthe dec is ion-making capacity of the Government as a whole in respectof its expenditure programmes.    By itself, however, it will not complete the central capability for decision making to be at the disposalof the Cabinet which we have in mind.   A further study, therefore, willbe needed to enable us to decide what else is required,,    I am thereforeconsidering with the Ministers concerned, and the Secretary of theCabinet, the nature and functions of the machinery we require.    It wouldbe my intention to put proposals to the Management Projects committee at the latest by 1 October next.    This work will take account of the inter-departmental staffs which have been created in the Cabinet Office toprovide advice and support to the Committees responsible for developingforward thinking in broad areas of policy.    It is expected that the team of businessmen will have a valuable contribution to make in this area also.5.     A number of other projects have been identified in which thebusiness team can play a part.    These include procurement (in the sense of government purchases of standard items which is already being investigated by a unit within the Treasury); manpower services; research and development activities; and computer services (including specificallythe Inland Revenue).    Specific proposals in these areas will be submittedto the Management Projects Committee.6.     It is obviously important that these studies, and the others onwhich the business team will be engaged, should be co-ordinated with anyother similar activities, whether or not involving the use of businessmen,which particular Ministers may decide to embark on within their ownDepartments.    I should therefore be glad if my colleagues would consultme before recruiting a businessman for a major management study or similar task, or undertaking such a study by other means, e. g. by the useof management consultants,J civil  Service Department, SWl13th July 19702
