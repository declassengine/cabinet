If we go ahead with Concorde we cannot get back any of the 480 million spent or committed so far by the British and french governments,    British and French officials agree that, after writing offeverything sjsent so far and ;taMng into account only future expenditure(development and production) Concorde would lead to a large resource loss.lUAUA    111WA    1973/74 1974/7575	86	72	3022-	-33.

At best if 150 Concordes are sold, the amount we still haveto spend on development will exceed our receipts from levies by not lessthan some  75 million (discounted),,5.        The most optimistic forecast of sales is 15 0 aircraft.    french officials have forecast 130, British the lower part of the range 5 0-15 0.It is most likely that further development costs will riae from   800 million to at least  85 0 million.    As the figures given above show even on the mostoptimistic estimates  Concorde is not economically worthwhile.    We shouldbe paying too high a price in terms of real resources used for the$1,200 million of possible export proceeds quoted bv the Minister of technology.6.        Moreover the Government would face possible additional losses(a) Since it would be financing the production of Concorde on loan,fewer sales than the number assumed for amortising the initialproduction investment would bring loss to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment - for the f:.rms have flatly refused to bear enyrisk of loss on production; they are in fact asking for a guaranteed profit,(b) K, as the Minister has warned, British Overseas airways corporation have to be &quot;persuaded&quot; - he. subsidised - to buy the Concorde.BAC 3117.        The Ministry of technology s analysis of the market prospectssuggests that sales might be in the range 150 to 240.    Apart from the bac 111 there is nothing in the recent history of the United Kingdomaircraft industry to suggest that these forecasts are likely to be achieved.But even if the forecasts are right, the foreign exchange benefitsresulting would be obtained at a high price in terms of the use of national resources.    IE costs are kept within the estimates and sales reach 240the project (airframe and engine combined) shows an implied preference interms of foreign exchange of 9 per cent.    But sales may well fall short of
this, and the total of resources used on the project exceed present estimates.    At 150 sales, and assuming a 10 per cent deterioration in the ratio of costs to selling price, the figure would be 32 per cent.This is much too high a premium to pay for foreign exchange.8.       Again the Government would lose heavily on its own investment.Even if 240 aircraft were sold the Government would stand to lose 40 million on a discounted basis.    With sales of 240, I take it that the firm would be making a substantial profit.    If this is so the terms onwhich the Minister is proposing that we should support this projectseem grossly inequitable.conclusions .       Concorde;    The economic assessment assumes that the aircraft can meet all its targets.    I suggest therefore that there is no point indelaying a decision until after the Mach 2 tests.    Since the Government is committed to reducing public expenditure and Concorde can, at best, makeonly a substantial loss, I conclude that we should withdraw from the projectforth, with.10.       BAG 311.    Unless this were abnormally and improbably successful,the prospective foreign exchange benefits would not be sufficient to justifyits high cost in national resources,    Even in the unlikely event of selling240 aircraft the Government would not, in discounted terms, recover itsinvestment.M V treasury Chambers SWl21 July 1970
ANNEX AECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF AIRCRAFT PROJECTSThe following is the procedure, agreed by the Departmentsconcerned, for economic assessment of civil aircrafc and aeroengineprojects-    In &quot;brief, the calculation is intended to reveal:(a) The balance of payments benefits likely to a?ise froma particular project, compared with the resource costof the development and construction of the aircraft and/or aeroengine.    (The implied preference.)(b) The balance of payments benefit compared with thefinancial loss, if any, to the Government on its owncontribution.    (The implied subsidy.)Implied Preference2.     The purpose of this part of the calculation is to assess theeconomic outturn of an aircraft project, on a Discounted Cash Flow(DCF) basis, in terms of the price paid for the foreign exchangebenefit earned.   Expenditure and receipts are estimated on anannual basis over the life of the project and then discounted topresent values at 10 per cent (the &quot;test discount rate for investment in the public sector) to yield total figures for the present valueof both.   Allowances are made for import savings, for the cost of imported parts and for the cost in national resource terms of theexport credit terms which will apply to most export sales ofcompleted aircraft and initial spares.   From the net totals thusobtained can be calculated the net profit or loss on the project.If there is a loss, this loss, expressed as a percentage of receipts, can be regarded as the premium for the foreign exchangebenefit earned./Implied Subsidy
Implied Subs idymmw iiirn   *i ii   - m m   mm.....  mn i i i mm3o     Government assistance to civil aircraft and aeroengine projectstakes the form of a conditional grant (known as launching aid)subject to a maximum cash figure which is expressed as a percentage,normally 50 per cent, of the agreed launching costs,    (in the caseof Concorde, of course, the U.K. and French Governments are paying the whole R. and D. costs.)   Launching aid is paid in instalmentsover the early years of a project and entitles the Government to recover levies on sales.   The implied subsidy calculation startsfrom the present value (discounted at 10 per cent) of the government contribution, including any Government intramural expenditure, less the expected levies on sales (similarly discounted).   The resultingfigure for the net cost of the project to the Government can thenbe expressed as a percentage of the foreign exchange benefit.
