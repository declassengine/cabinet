(This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)CP(fO) 1415th July 1970 Copy No.^._*CABINETSalaries of the Higher judiciary memorandum by the Lord chancellor. I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memorandum about the pay of thehigher Civil Service which I understand is to beconsidered by the Cabinet at its meeting tomorrow.However, I have had the advantage of seeing inadvance a copy of the passage which I understand thatthe Lord Privy Seal intends to include in his Paperdealing with the repercussions of any increase in the pay of higher civil servants on the salaries of thehigher judiciary.   It is apparently proposed that ifwe agree to give the higher civil servants on the 1stJanuary 1971 stage 3 of the salary increaserecommended by the Plowden Committee then the Judgesshould be told that the Government agree to a reviewof their pay in the light of this decision, either bya new independent body, if this can be set up inreasonable time, or failing this by some ad hocinterdepartmental body reporting to Ministers.2. In its present form I cannot regard this asat all acceptable.   As I explained to colleagues on- 1 -SEGUE!
the Economic Policy Committee, I am faced with seriousdissatisfaction on the part of the Judges (who, it willhe remembered, are recruited entirely from members of aprofession earning incomes far in excess of what we can offer and eagerly sought after with offers of highly paid posts in commerce and industry) at the way inwhich they have been treated by our predecessors.   Ifthe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposal were accepted, the inevitable result would, I am advised, be an explosion of anger which, in my judgment, would bo entirelyjustified, and would seriously jeopardise recruitmentat a time when Beeching and other reforms notoriouslyrequire additional manpower.3. If I may summarise the recent history.   Sorecently as a year ago (30th June 1969) the Judges&apos;salary stood at  10,000 whilst that of a permanent secretary was  8,600 - a margin in favour of the judges of  1,400.   The result of stage 1 was to put up thePermanent Secretary&apos;s salary to  9,800, therebyreducing the margin to  200.   In view of the prospectivefurther increase in stage 2 which put up the permanent secretaries&apos; salaries to  11,900 our predecessors put up the Judges&apos; to  11,500 at the end of May this yearbut explained that this was only an interim increasepending a review by the special panel which they proposed to set up but which has now fallen by thewayside as the result of the Election.   The effect
of these changes was to convert the margin in favour ofthe Judges to an adverse differential of  400 at least for the time being.4.        What is now proposed is to give permanent secretaries  14,000 as at the 1st January 1971 whilstdoing nothing more for the Judges than promise a review,thus converting an adverse margin of  400 into an adverse margin of  2,500, with no definite undertakingfor the future.   The Judges would inevitably regard thisboth as a manifest injustice and as a breach of faith.The minimum required to avert the explosion of which Iam warned is to let the Judges know that the Governmenthave decided to give them at least the sum whichPermanent Secretaries are to receive on the 1st Januarypending any further review which may be required toestablish what relativity (if any) betv/een Judges and permanent Secretaries should be maintained.H. of St. M.House of LordsLondon S.1T.1.15th July 1970.
