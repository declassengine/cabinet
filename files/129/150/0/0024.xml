THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOKMemnrandum by the Prime minister should like my colleagues to be aware, when they come toconsider the memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on public expenditure (CP(70) 20), of the economic situation in which we find ourselves, the prospect which we face, and its implications forour policy objectives.    In brief, the message is that, if we want room for manoeuvre, we have to create it for ourselves.ECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROSPECTS2.     We now have the benefit of a recently completed projection bythe Treasury forecasters.3.     Economic activity has been less buoyant so far this year than was expected at the time of the Budget, and there is probably a little slack inthe economy.    But the evidence is conflicting.    Industrial production hasbeen reasonably buoyant; the level of unemployment, though high by post-war standards, rose very little in the first half of the year; andthere are signs of an increase in consumers&apos; expenditure.    I doubt whether comparisons of the actual level of unemployment with previous years provide a reliable indication of slack, because generous redundancy payments and earnings-related benefits enable workers to take longer in moving jcbs.    The pressure of demand is high in manufacturing(especially capital goods) industries, and in the South-East and theMidlands.    Against this background we must assume that a general increase in demand faster than the increase in productive potential wouldquite quickly lead to shortages and increased imports.4.     The forecasts and the other evidence available suggest that outputcan from now on, in the absence of any policy changes, be expected to grow broadly in line with productive potential.    The composition of thegrowth of demand is not ideal.    Consumers&apos; expenditure is forecast toincrease by about 2\ per cent a year (reflecting the large rise in money incomes); public expenditure on goods and services is forecast toincrease substantially; manufacturing investment is expected to level out,and then fall slightly in 1971.    Wages and salaries are forecast to rise by11 per cent this year, and nearly as much again next year.    The retail price index is forecast to rise by b\ per cent this year and nearlyS\ per cent next year.1HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s government cp(70) 24 COPY NO        ,1si %21 July 1970CABINET
5.     The forecasters still expect a surplus of about  500 million onthe current account of the balance of payments this year and again next.This seems to me to be over-optimistic in the light of the trade figures in recent months,    I cannot believe that it is consistent with a continuance of the present rate of inflation.    We cannot expect the capital account of the balance of payments to continue as favourable as it was in1969.    There is a net outflow on official capital account (mainly aidloans, repayments of the poct-war Joans from North America andrepayments of Ex-Im Bank loans to finance purchases of United states military aircraft).    The net outflow of export credit is  300 million ayear and still rising.    Net private investment abroad is expectedsubstantially to exceed private investment from abroad in this country.We shall receive an allocation of  120 million of special drawing rightsnext year, and perhaps some short-term capital inflow! but our ability to repay overseas debt between now and the end of 1971 looks like beingsignificantly less than the repayments due.    We cannot improve thecapital account without adding to the existing constraints on capitaltransactions (which of course we criticised in Opposition).    A current account surplus of  500 million is not in these circumstances an unnecessary luxury.POLICY IMPLICATIONS6.     We have first and foremost to slow down the rate of inflation.This is not a matter for crash action but of progressive retardation,which means above all sustained determination among ourselves, andthe encouragement of similar determination among employers in thepublic sector as well as in the private sector, in the face of clearlyexcessive wage demands.    As we are now seeing, this course will involve strikes, and short-term costs in terms of external trade or foreign exchange; but there will be long-term gains provided that ourmanagement of affairs continues to command confidence among overseasholders of sterling and in industry here.7.     There is not the sort of slack in the economy which would allow the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make large reductions of taxationunless we can achieve a real improvement in personal savings and majorreductions in public expenditure,,    Treasury Ministers are, I know,looking into the possibilities on personal savings, but these will not by themselves be sufficient.    If we want to make the major change of direction we have promised, we shall have also to be ready forsignificant reductions in public expenditure on goods and services (notjust in transfer payments).    If we can get them, so as to provideourselves with room for corresponding reductions in the burden of direct taxation on individuals and on company profits, we can look, after a time, for increases in productivity and ia industrial efficiency.    Butthere is a long way to go.    Our predecessors published risingprogrammes of public expenditure, which would have required increased taxation.    We shall need determination, and a willingness among spendingMinisters to accept reductions in programmes which from a purelyDepartmental standpoint they would be reluctant to make.secret
8.      On the external front we must try to deal with our indebtednesson a less hand to mouth basis than our predecessors.    We should aim at reducing the prospective total of export credit, which is increasingmore rapidly than we can afford.    We should seek to fund or rollforward some of the short and medium-term debt.    This should not present insuperable problems so long as we have the general situationand the management of public expenditure well in hand.    But this is afield in which we shall be wise not to publieise our aspirations.    Weare more likely to find our creditors willing negotiators if we do notappear to take their willingness for granted in advance.    And weshould seek to improve the capital account in other ways,9.     The conclusion is quite simply stated.    If we are to giveourselves che freedom of manoeuvre which we need to fulfil ourpledges to reduce the burden of taxation and to restore the competitivevitality of British industry, we have not only to reduce the rate of inflation and to improve the rate of personal savings but also tosecure a large reduction in the total of public expenditure.    It will notbe easily or quickly done, and reductions of public expenditure take time to work through the economy.    !  we want to produce results by1972, we must take decisions now.E H10 Downing Street SWl21 July lc,?Q3
