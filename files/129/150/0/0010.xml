DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government now that the main Cabinet Committees have been constitutedI should like to remind my colleagues of the importance of ensuring that all the main issues of Government policy are fully examined bythe appropriate Committees before they are submitted to the Cabinet.Where possible they should be decided by the Committee concerned;and questions should only be referred upwards to Cabinet if they are of major importance or involve sensitive political issues.    The right ofall Ministers to appeal to the Cabinet will, of course, remain unimpaired.But I hope that they will use this right sparingly; and I shall normally be guided by the view of a Committee Chairman in deciding whether anappeal to the Cabinet should be allowed.    Once we have taken a decisionwe must stick to it.    We must also ensure that it has the maximumimpact on public opinion; and I ask my colleagues, therefore, to takeparticular care to make certain that the Lord Presidents Office isinformed in adequate time of all forthcoming announcements of policyin order that the Lord President may consider both their presentationand their most appropriate timing.2.     It is understandable that under the pressure of our first few days of office it should have been necessary to take and sometimes to announcepolicy decisions without full consultation with colleagues.    But thisshould no longer be so and I must ask all Ministers to ensure that issues of policy are not henceforward decided without a thorough discussion inthe relevant Committee.    I should like them also to remember that this administration will not introduce legislation with retrospective effectunless it is advantageous to the ordinary citizen.    I am sure that it isimportant that we should be seen from the outset to observe this principle.CP(70) 106th July 1970CABINETPROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING POLICY DECISIONSNote by the Prime MinisterE H10 Downing Street SWl6th July 1970
