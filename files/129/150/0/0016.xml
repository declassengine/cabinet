POSTAL AND REMITTANCE SERVICE charges memorandum by fche Chief Secretary, TreasuryAt the request of. the Economic Strategy Committee I have discussed with the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications the Post Office*sproposals for increasing tariffs for postal and remittance cervices.    Themain proposal is for an increase of 2d next January (to 6d and 7d) in the basic two-tier postal rates; these would be converted (in accordance withthe normal conversion table) fco 2gp and 3p on decimalisation.2.        The proposed Increases in postal rates would yield come 130 million in a full year.    The Post Office estimate that this wouldconvert an expected loss of  263 million into a profit of  4-0 million overthe 5 years ending March 1973: this would enable the Post Office very nearly to reach their financial objective on postal services over the period,which is to cover costs and return an additional 2 per cent (about 8 million a year) on expenditure.3.        In my view the assumptions underlying these forecasts are, if anything, optimistic.    Earnings are assumed to rise by 5f per cent a year,compared with 10 per cent (already agreed) in 1970-71.    Productivity, whichin the past has risen by no more than jr per cent a year, is assumed to buildup to lj per cent a year, for a labour-intensive industry with an immediate prospect of diminishing traffic, this will not be easy.4.        This means taking a tough attitude to wage demands.    TheGovernment can reinforce their determination on this issue by statingpublicly that no further increases In postal charges should be needed for at least 3 years.    If in the event a further increase were needed, theGovernment would then be able publicly to identify the cause as excessivewage increases.5,        The following table gives the financial prospects in greater detail.This shows accumulated losses assuming future wage increases (a) of5j per cent a year (the Post OfficeTs assumption) and (b) of 8 per cent ayear.    It also shows the effect on these losses of increasing the basictariffs by Id and 2d respectively,1CP(70)16 COPY NO   5417 July 1970CABINET

These figures show that, given the accumulation of losses from thepast, even a rise of 2d next January would, on optimistic assumptions,barely enable the Post Office to meet their financial objective over theperiod: at the same time it should mean that no further increases would berequired for at least three years.    Even if a lower financial system were set the case for a tariff increase v/ould not be affected..   With an increaseof only Id the postal services would never get out of the red, and would beleft with cumulative losses approaching  100 million by 1972-73,   A smallerincrease than the Post Office are asking for (and, a fortiori, no increase at all) v/ould leave the postal service with a substantial deficit which couldonly be met by cross-subsidisation from the telecommunications side of thebusiness.   Among the objections to this are:i. Suspending the normal discipline on the Post Office toact commercially would be bad for morale and efficiency.ii. In economic terms, there is a risk that crocs-subsidisationwould lead to a misallocation of resources as between posts and telecommunications, with consequential adverse effects on industrial efficiency generally.iii. There would be a loss to the Exchequer of up to  130 million a year - equivalent to say 3d in the   on income tax,iv. The gain in terms of influencing the wage-price spiral isdoubtful: allowing foi the demand effects of the loss of revenue, itappears unlikely that postal tariffs have any appreciable impact onwage claims.v. There is no reason in equity why the cost cf the postal services should fall on the taxpayer rather than the consumer.2
vi. Once a form of subsidy has been deliberately introduced,there would be continual pressure for its use to be extended.vii, We should need a succession of tariff increases (say threeincreases of Id within two years) to get back on course, v/lthoutthe opportunity we now have of attributing them to the position wehave inherited.7. Curtailment of the service offers no immediate solution.    ThePost Officets view is that the only reduction cf service which could make a significant impact on finance would be to do away with the second delivery.This would save no more than  15- 20 million per annum, would take someyears to become fully effective, and would therefore not materially effect the case for the price Increases now proposed.    The Post Office advise that it would be unwise, and would produce the worst possible public reaction, to combine a tariff increase with a worsening of service.conclusion.        For these reasons I conclude that our best course is not to stand inthe way of the Post Officets proposals on postal and remittance services,A decision is needed urgently to enable the Post Office to prepare for thechange and for decimalisation: It will also help to connect the increasesmore closely to v/age settlements already allowed.    The following are my recommendations:i. That the Post Office should be allowed to consult the PostOffice UsersT National Council at once about their tariff proposals.ii. Pending the Councils Report, the Minister of Posts and telecommunications should formally reserve the governments position,iii. When the increases are eventually agreed, the Governmentshould state that in their view no further increases should be needed on postal tariff 3 for at least another three years,iv. The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications might beinvited to&apos; consider the need for a longer term study of the postal services, to include organisation and management, the future of thetwo-tier system and the consequences of cross-subsidisation.M V treasury Chambers SW117 July 19703
