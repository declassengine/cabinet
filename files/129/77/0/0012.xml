oBECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE: BAMANGWATO SUCCESSIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsSince my predecessor reported in May, 1953 (C. (53) 150) on Bamangwatoaffairs, there has been no pronounced change in the situation. Seretse is still inthis country. The Tribe have not yet brought themselves to designate a new chief,but Rasebolai, who is acting as &quot; Native Authority &quot; to fill the gap so far as possible,is still in process of establishing his position.2. At the Labour Party Conference in September, .1954, the national executive was urged to give an undertaking that the next Labour Governmentwould put right the &quot; gross denial of human rights&quot; caused by Seretse&apos;s&quot; banishment for life.&quot; This was ridden off by Mr. James Griffiths, who gave an assurance that the National Executive of the Labour Party would review thewhole of the circumstances under which Seretse was excluded from the protectorate and would consider what action should be taken by a future labour government.3. In May, 1955, the Labour Party sent one of their officials, Mr. Hatch,to Bechuanaland to make enquiries locally. After his return, the national executive of the Labour Party approved (and published) a resolution in favourof a plan for inviting leaders of the Bamangwato Tribe to visit London and havediscussions with Seretse. The Secretary of the Labour Party informed me of this resolution in a letter in which he also asked me to receive a deputation. A copyof his letter is attached (Annex A).4. In reply, I agreed to receive the deputation, but said I could hold out no prospect that we could agree to the proposed discussions. I gave the substance ofmy letter to the Press, as it was important to steady opinion in Africa. A copyof my reply is attached (Annex B).5. I received the Labour Party deputation, led by Mr. James Griffiths, on 9th August. I attach a summary of the discussion (Annex C). I made it clear thatthere can be no change of policy, and that we cannot agree to call a conference ofTribal representatives for talks with Seretse.6. As the matter will probably be raised again at the next Labour party conference, I have written to Mr. Griffiths, reiterating that we could not agree toany such talks as he had proposed which could do no good but might do muchharm. To make clear that our attitude is not wholly negative, I pointed out thatwhen a new Chief has established himself we will sympathetically consider thepossibility of Seretse&apos;s return to the Bamangwato Reserve as a private citizen; ifSeretse were to renounce unconditionally all pretensions to the Chieftainship, thatwould itself contribute to the establishment of the new Chief. I hope that theletter may lead the Opposition to use their influence to persuade Seretse to renounce his pretensions, and may also lead them to drop the idea of a conferenceof Tribal leaders. A copy of my letter is attached (Annex D).7. The latest report from the High Commissioner about RasebolaFs positionis encouraging. The Administration have lost no opportunity of fortifying hismorale, arid the High Commissioner saw him at the. end of July and found him in good heart.8.

ANNEX ATHE LABOUR PARTYMP/JY Transport House, Smith Square, SWA,27th July, 1955.The Rt. Hon. The Earl of Home,Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.Dear Secretary of State,The National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, at its meeting thismorning, approved the following statement:  &quot; The National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, havingconsidered the report of their Commonwealth Officer who has recently madeinvestigations in Bechuanaland, is convinced that the position of SeretseKhama should be reconsidered by the Government. The first step towardsresolving the problem should be for the Government to invite responsibleleaders of Bamangwato, including Tshekedi, Rasebolai and Keaboka, withtheir advisers and with representatives of the tribal headmen, to visit london in order to discuss the situation with Seretse and the best way of dealing with it. The object should be to bring all factions of the tribe together inco-operation for its future development. There is good reason to believe thatthe leaders of the Bamangwato Tribe would welcome such an opportunityof consultation.The National Executive Committee of the Labour Party has decided tosend a deputation to the Government in order to put forward this proposal as an attempted solution to this vexed problem.&quot;2.   It has thereupon appointed a delegation consisting of:  Mr. W. Burke, M.P.,Mr. Tom Driberg,Rt. Hon. James Griffiths, M.P.,Mr. Percy Knight,Mr. Sam Watson,and I shall be glad to know if you will receive them and if your secretary cancommunicate with me to arrange a mutually convenient date.The above resolution has been released for publication in to-morrow morning&apos;spapers.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)        MORGAN PHILLIPS,Secretary.ANNEX BDear Mr. Morgan Phillips, 28th July, 1955.I have received your letter of 27th July covering the text of a statement of theNational Executive of the Labour Party on the position of Seretse Khama.You and your colleagues are well aware of the decided and settled policy ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter. As was made clear in the White paper of March 1950, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have a wide responsibility for thewell being and good government of the Protectorate, as a whole, and of the other high Commission Territories. In particular they have in this respect a duty inmatters of disputed successions that they must *discharge. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have as you know decided that the good government and the well being Ofthe Bamangwato Reserve require that Seretse should absent himself from the protectorate until an alternative chief has been securely established with his ownnative administration. I am satisfied that the outcome of any discussions withtribal representatives such as you now propose would not justify any change in thispolicy.  Indeed such discussions could only cause fresh uncertainty and by stirring
u d old rivalries and rekindling bitterness, do great harm. I can, therefore hold outno prospect of Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreeing to discussions such as yourresolution suggests. I shall, however, be very ready to receive your deputation and I suggest a meeting at the Commonwealth Relations Office on August 9th.Since your resolution has been released to the Press I am informing them ofthe substance of this letter. xr       .      ,Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)     HOME.Morgan Phillips, Esq.,Secretary, The Labour Party,Transport House, S.W.1.ANNEX CSECRETSummary of discussion between Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Labour Party Delegation on 9th AugustSERETSEThe Labour Party deputation urged the following considerations in support oftheir proposal for a conference of tribal representatives in London.id) The Bamangwato would continue to look forward to Seretse&apos;s return as chief. Rasebolai had no prospect of being designated as Chief, and unless some fresh attempt were made to achieve a final settlement thepresent uncertainty would continue,(b) Hatch&apos;s discussions showed that there was a disposition on the part of thetribal leaders to try to work ,out a solution at such a conference.The oonferen.ee could explore the possibility of Seretse^s return as Chief leaving the question of his wife&apos;s position and the succession unsettled. If no agreement were reached on this basis (and the deputation admitted that this was at leastlikely) the conference might then provide opportunity for decision by Seretse towithdraw his claim to the Chieftainship. Seretse could not be expected to do this without discussion with tribal representatives and would need to return to thereserve in order to make a formal renunciation there. It might be that theconference would throw up some alternative suggestion which would contribute toa solution.I told the deputation that it was necessary to face the fact that Seretse couldnot go back as Chief with a white wife. This left only the alternative solution of seretse&apos;s^ renunciation. It had been made clear that once a Chief was securelyestablished Her Majesty&apos;s Government would consider arrangements for his returnas private citizen. He had been told that renunciation of his claim to the chieftainship would bring nearer the time when this might be possible. I told the deputation categorically that there was no question of a change of policy andthat the communique to be issued after the meeting must make it clear that I stoodtirm on the decision conveyed to the Labour Party in the letter of 28th July.ANNEX DSECRETLetter to the Rt. Hon. J. Griffiths, M.P., dated 22nd August, 1955Since receiving your Deputation on 9th August, I have again carefully considered the views expressed by them. But in the result I am confirmed in theconclusion which I intimated to the Deputation. Her Majesty&apos;s government cannot relinquish their responsibility for the peace ,and good government of the bechuanaland Protectorate, and they could not agree to a conference of the kind proposed.   As the deputation recognised, not only the specific alternatives they
mentioned, but any others that might be put forward, would be open to discussion. In the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government the effect would be to throwopen the whole Bamangwato issue with little likelihood of any generally acceptableoutcome, and with the certain prospect of causing great unsettlement in the reserve and damage to the Bamangwato tribe and the people of Bechuanaland. As youyourself said during our discussion, if the conference failed to reach agreement,the end would be worse than the beginning.As I made clear to the Deputation, there is no question of the permanentbanishment of Seretse Khama, and that is no part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^policy. As has frequently been stated, and as I repeated in my letter of 28th july to the Secretary of the Labour Party, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decidedthat Seretse should absent himself from the Protectorate until an alternative chief has been securely established with his own native administration. When a chief has been so established Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be very ready to givesympathetic consideration to the possibility of Seretse&apos;s return to the bamangwato reserve as a private citizen.There can of course be no question of &quot; abdication,&quot; since Seretse Khama isnot, and never has been, recognised as chief. But Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreewith the deputation that his unconditional renunciation of all claim to the chieftainship would contribute to the establishment of a new chief, and so wouldhasten the day when his return as a private citizen could become possible. IfSeretse were prepared to take this step, which in our view would be for the goodof the tribe, I am sure that authoritative means could be worked out for conveyinghis decision to the tribal elders and to the Bamangwato generally without any needfor his prior return to the reserve. I must tell you frankly that I do not believeSeretse is prevented from renouncing his claim to the chieftainship by his inability to discuss this with representatives of the tribe. I believe the only reason which prevents him from doing this is the hope that there will be a change of policy whichwill permit him to go back as chief. The conference which you propose would inmy view encourage him in this hope rather than the reverse.I am grateful to you for the thought which you and the Labour Party ExecutiveCommittee have given to this problem, and I appreciate your concern to promote the unity and well-being of the tribe. But for the reasons which I have explainedI must again make it clear that the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is as I have described it above.
