113 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government secret.(55) 110 COPY NO. ^ f25th August. 1955CABINETDISARMAMENTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues a memorandum representing theviews of the Official Committee on Disarmament on Mr. Stassenrsproposal that the United Nations Disarmament Sub-Committee should appoint a Technical Panel to consider typical or sample installations of types which would have to be covered by an effective system of inspection.H. M,Foreign Office, S. W.1.25th August, 1955.
Mr. Stassen has now informed us (Washington telegram No. 1974,paragraph 4) that the United States plans to suggest to the United NationsDisarmament Sub-Committee next week that it should appoint a TechnicalPanel composed of representatives from each of the five countries represented on it, to visit each country and &quot;to consider typical orsample installations of types which would have to be covered by an effective system of inspection&quot;.    The findings of the Panel would be without prejudice to the Sub-Committee&apos;s later discussions on inspection and control but the scheme would give the Sub-Committee experience ofthe practical problems involved.2.        It is difficult to reach a final view on this suggestion so long asit is not clear what exactly the Americans mean by the word &quot;consider&quot;(which may mean inspect) and &quot;installations&quot; (which may mean nuclear-plants as well as conventional armaments plants).    We also do not knowwho the Americans think should choose the samples.    These points will only be cleared up when the Minister of State has spoken to the americans in New York.3.        Indeed, the object of this proposal is obscure.    It may be meantsincerely, as an experiment which will produce useful knowledge andinduce confidence.    Or it may be a -tactical move in the expectation thatthe Soviet Union will reject it because it dislikes any form of inspection.Or again it may be designed to hold the position in the Sub-Committeewhile the Americans continue their studies and pursue bilaterally theproposal which President Eisenhower made at Geneva for aerial surveysof the United States and Soviet Union04.       Although only limited gains may come from this scheme, it is submitted that Mr. Nutting should give it the general support of KerMajesty!s Government, subject to the conditions mentioned below.    Thissupport could be used as a lever to enlist American support on othermatters, notably on the Prime Minister&apos;s plan for inspection of the forcesin Europe, which the French have come out against.    If carried out,Mr. Stassen&apos;s suggestion might add to our knowledge and would be a pilotscheme which might build up confidence as a supplement to the PrimeMinister!s plan.5.        Much will depend on the types of installation chosen.    these could include barracks, ports, airfields, armaments factories, aircraft factories, shipyards and nuclear production plants.    Certain of thesea&apos;re extremely sensitive.    We do not know whether the Americans intend to include nuclear plants.    If they do, it must be clearly understood thataif the scheme to fulfil the object of giving &quot;some experience of thepractical problems involved&quot; in control, this would entail revealing secretsabout technical processes and quantities which we have not yet disclosed to anyone.    Similar considerations apply to other plants (e. g. Rolls Royceaero-engine factories) which might be included.6C        We should therefore attach the following conditions to oursupports-
(1)    The types of &quot;installation&quot; to be visited should be defined by the Disarmament Sub-committee it would be unwise to include nuclear productionplants 0(2)    The host country should choose the individualinstallations to be inspected so that the visit bythe Panel could be unrestricted and not a waste of time or an embarrassment.    Installationswhere important processes or advanced types of weapons are to be found should therefore notbe selected,,(3)    The questioning by the Panel should be confined to persons nominated by the host country.(4)    There should be agreement that two or even three ofthe countries represented on the Sub-Committeeshould be visited simultaneously in order to avoid the awkward problem of deciding which country should be inspected first.(5)    The composition of the Panel would be dependent onthe list of installations to be visited but should beas small as possible.(6)    The Panel should conduct its work as expeditiously aspossible,,
