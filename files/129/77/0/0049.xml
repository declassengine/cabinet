Publication of this Report has been promised in theHouse of Commons, and provisional arrangements for publication have been made.2. In view of current interest in National Service, I should, nevertheless, be grateful for my colleagues&apos; agreement to the reports appearance at this juncture.W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,13th October, 1955.SUMMARY OF REPORT ON ENQUIRY INTO THE EFFECTS OFNATIONAL SERVICE ON THE EDUCATION ANDEMPLOYMENT OF YOUNG MENPurpose of the EnquiryThis Enquiry was undertaken at the request of the Advisory Council onRelationship between Employment in the Services and Civilian Life. Its purpose was to find out whether National Service gives rise to problems bearing upon theemployment, vocational guidance and resettlement of young men on which action should be taken, either by the Government or industry, in order to avoid waste of manpower or of ability.How the Enquiry was Carried OutThe men chosen to take part were those who completed their two years&apos;National Service in September 1953. This sample included University students andthose still in course of completing their education, apprentices and other trainees,j    as well as men already in employment.The Enquiry was carried out in June-July 1954, nine months after the men had returned to civilian life and was made by means of interviews conducted by officers of the Employment Exchanges.Of the 13,436 National Servicemen who were discharged in September 1953,10,708, or 80 per cent., took part voluntarily in the Enquiry.48903
Conclusions of the EnquiryI. Of 10,708 who participated in the Enquiry 9,697 men (90-6 per cent.)were satisfactorily settled. Of these (a) 8,598 (80-3 per cent.) were settled in employment.  This figure included2,668 (94-2 per cent.) of the 2,831 who had completed theirok vqo ; apprenticeship or other systematic training with an employer beforecall-up; of these 34-5 per cent, served in a trade related to their pre-Service training during their period of National Service. More menreturned to their pre-Service employment where employers had kept in touch with them during their time in the Forces;(b) 1,099 (10-3 per cent.) were continuing their further education.  Some ofthese had gone back to the Universities, others had resumed professionaltraining.II. The men who were most settled in civilian employment before NationalService, e.g., those who had been apprentices or had had other systematic training and those who had had only one or two jobs before enlistment, had the leastdifficulty in settling down afterwards. This suggests that vocational guidance is most effective when given some time before a boy is called up as he can thensettle in his job or training and will regard the interruption caused by NationalService as a temporary break in his career which can be resumed without difficultyafterwards.III. A number of men who at first sight appeared to have been unsettled by national Service had in fact poor employment records before they were called-upso that their problems may be not so much resettlement problems caused by national Service as continuing employment problems that already existed before they were called up.The general conclusion to be drawn from the results of the Enquiry is that,although National Service must inevitably cause some disturbance in civiliancareers, it does not create any major problems of employment or resettlement.\
