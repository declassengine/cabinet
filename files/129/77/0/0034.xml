1A&amp;SECRET iC.P.(55)  134- COPY NO.21st September. 1955CABINETNATIONAL ASSISTANCE. NATIONAL insurance and THE COST OP LIVING-,-,--.r : r - -Memorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National InsuranceThis paper requires no action.   I circulate it because i think it may be of help to my colleagues in discussing ourpresent difficulties to be able to see in pictorial form what we have achieved in the field .of Assistance and Insurancesince 1951* and the extent to which these achievements must be prejudiced by any further rise in the cost of living, whetherthis occurs as a result of further wage inflation, or bydeliberate acts of policy, such as the abolition of the bread subsidy.2.     The first chart deals with national assistance scales andtheir purchasing power in terms of the kind-of things upon which persons In need spend their money.   The cost of living forthese people has risen more steeply than it has for the generalrun of the population, because they spend a higher proportionof their Incomes on essentials like food and fuel, which have risen more in price than other less essential goods and services0The chart begins in 194-8 because it was on that date that theSocialist Government claimed that the new assistance scales gaveto the poorest of the poor a better standard than ever before.The chart shows that when the Socialist Government raisedassistance scales in 1950 and again in 1951 they did no   morethan make good the loss of purchasing power which had occurred;the increases restored the 194-8 position.   The increase givenin the Summer of 1952 went further, and raised the standard ofthese people to the highest level ever achieved.   It enabled us to claim until the Autumn of 1954- that persons on assistancewere better off than at any time under the Socialist Government.The increase given in February of this year restored the positionas it was in June, 1952.   It will be seen, however, that thereis now not much margin left.   Quite a small further rise inthe cost of living will put persons on assistance back to thestandard of July, 194-8.    If this occurs, the Board would soonproceed to recommend an increase in the scale.   The smallestpracticable rise which tbejr could recommend is 2s. 6d. a week for a single person; they might well recommend, as they didin 1952, raising the scale by more than that in order to anticipate a further rise in the cost of living, and avoid theadministrative difficulties which frequent changes in the scales involved.   An increase of 2s. 6d. would cost theExchequer over  12 millions a year, and of 5s. over  24- millions a year.
ISO-3*     Chart No. 2 shows how national insurance benefits have moved since 1946 in relation to the ordinary retail prices index0It illustrates clearly how, from the time when pension and benefit rates were first fixed in 1946, the pension lost valuedespite the increases made for some pensioners only by theSocialists in October, 1951, and by our Government for allpensioners in 1952*    The recent increases.in pension and benefitrates which came into force in the spring of this year notonly fully restored the 1946 value, but enabled us to claimat the Election that the purchasing power of pensions, and benefits was higher than when first fixed in 1946*    Here again,a further rise of three points in the retail prices index, suchas that announced in July, would bring the purchasing power of &apos;pensions and benefits at basic rates back to the 1946 leveloh*     Chart No. 3 shows the number of grants of national assistance in payment, and the number of such grants given insupplementation of national insurance pensions and benefits.It shows how, from July, 1948, when the National Insurance schemecame into full operation, the number of assistance grants rosesteeply year by year up to the end of 1952.    In 1953 the paceslackened, and in 1954 we achieved virtual stabilisation.    the increases in national insurance pensions and benefits which came into force this spring were of course bigger than thecorresponding increases in national assistance scales.    since then the number of grants has fallen by 175,000 to the lowestfigure since 1952.   With a stable cost of living, there wouldbe every reason to hope that we had now turned the corner, andthat a progressive decline would occur in the numbers seekingassistance.    The favourable factors are mainly the growingproportion of old people who will have retirement pensionsjthe growing numberwifch occupational pensions;    and the growing number who have earned increments of national insurance pension of such magnitude as to take them outside the national assistancefield.    There has also been a revival of private thrift,encouraged by the greater stability in the value of money whichwe succeeded in achieving in the years 1952 to 1954*   with present wage levels there are great possibilities for moreprivate savings by working people, particularly against theirold age, in the years from 50 to 65.or so, when their childrenhave, for the most part, ceased to be a cause of expenditure and have left the home to make their own way in the world.5*     If a further rise in the cost of living takes place and theNational Assistance Board recommend an increase in assistancescales, our recent achievements will be jeopardised and we shallsee an increase in the numbers on assistance, and its cost.The only way of avoiding this would be once more to increasenational insurance pensions and benefits, and that would involveanother increase of&quot;insurance contributions.   Moreover, afurther increase in the cost of living v/ould give rise to pressure for further advances in the whole social securityfield, in war and industrial disability pensions? and in family allowances as well as in national insurance pensions and benefits.
Go     When Sir Geoffrey Hutchinson   succeeded Mr. George Buchananas Chairman of the National Assistance Board, I suggested tohim that he should make use of the Board&apos;s officers to collectsome information about the welfare of the agedo   A number of unofficial enquiries have already been made in this field;and some of them have given rather disquieting reports whichhave been politically embarrassing, although they reflectfavourably on the humanity of the Board&apos;s administration.    Theresult of the Board&apos;s enquiries appears in their Annual Reportfor 195J-!- which came out in July.    As many of my colleagues will&apos;not have seen it and as it is, I think, of exceptional interest,I attach the relevant extract from the Report as an Appendix,CP.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C2021st September, 1955*
appendix extract from the 195,4 Annual Report of theNational Assistance&apos; Board&apos; describing ^heTcTr cum stances&apos; of &apos;1*21 ,&apos;d&apos;od did peppTe over&apos;8d and&apos; &apos;ii&apos;vi&apos;ng aloneLess than one in ten of these old people were living and cooking in one room;   two-thirds were living in three or morerooms.   The great majority were found to be over-housed ratherthan under-housed.    It was plain that many had remained in the family home after the family had scattered,.   Hardly any of the over-housed old people would consider a suggestion that theyshould sublet rooms;    they have never sublet and are afraid of getting in &quot;the wrong type of people&quot;.   Although many ofthose who have been rehoused are happy, particularly in thespecially-designed bungalows included in some of the new housing estates, most of the old people seemed to prefer to endtheir days in the homes which, however inconvenient, hold theirmemories.Water was found to be reasonably accessible to most, but where it is not, friends and neighbours are generally availableto help to fetch it, though a few have to carry it themselves and the task puts a heavy strain on their strengths   although many have to go outside to a lavatory, lack of indoor sanitationis not looked upon as a hardship by people who have been accustomed to it all their lives.    One widow of 83, a retirednurse, lives alone in a country district in a three-roomedwooden bungalow with an outside lavatory and the only water50 yards from the house;    she has been offered a modern bungalowby the local Council but steadfastly refuses to move.Eighty out of every 100 homes were described as &quot;well kept&quot;and only about one in 50 as poor, neglected or insanitary.Many were reported to be in beautiful or spotless condition.In many cases the credit for this may be due to relatives,neighbours&apos;or paid domestic help, but it is also a tribute tothe vigour, the pride and the independence of the old people themselves.    In nearly every case where it seemed to be required(about 52,000) some sort of domestic help was already being given or was arranged for by the Board&apos;s officers, by a home helpsupplied by the Local Authority, by private arrangement (paymentbeing made by the Board through an addition to the allowance),or by relatives or friendly neighbours.   There were, as might beexpected, a fair number who refused to accept any help, and afew for whom help might indeed be difficult to obtain (forexample a woman of 85, who lives in a dirty, smelly, six-roomedhouse with a dog, three cats and a parrot, refuses io allowanyone to help her)*More than one-third of the old people send out theirlaundry (and receive special additions to their assistanceallowances to meet the cost) and about the same proportion are receiving some help with the shopping;    the visiting officersreported only a few cases where help of these kinds was required,or would be welcomed, but was not obtainable.
left a surprisingly large proportion of the old people -certainly much more than half of them - were to all appearanceswell and active;    no doubt other arrangements had already beenmade for most of the really frail and infirm, either in the homesof relatives or in an old people&apos;s home or in hospital.    Of thenearly 122,000 people over 80, only 2,1+00 - one in every 50 -were bedridden (the officers were of course at pains to satisfy themselves that some reasonable arrangements had been made fortheir care);    17,600, or 1ho5 per cent, though not bedriddenwere confined to the house.   The district nurse was attendingin 7.500 cases;    very few v/ere found who seemed to need herservices but were not getting them.    Where chiropody services have been arranged either by a voluntary organization or by theLocal Authority these are much appreciatedo    The great majoritysaid that they were in regular touch with their doctor, thoughthe Board&apos;s officer thought it desirable to advise some 2,000who had not seen their doctor for a long time to consult himabout some ailment that was troubling them.   Of the majority whowere in good health, many were anxious to pass on their particular recipes for a long life, &quot;a daily nip of whisky&quot;,&quot;drinking well-water&quot;, and &quot;temperance and hard work&quot; beinghighly recommended    One man of 8h returned no reply to questions about his health but climbed a tree and picked some apples byway of demonstration.Officers are expected, in the ordinary course of visiting,to take the opportunity of advising those old people who seem &quot;to need them how to obtain, free of charge, spectacles or falseteeth or hearing aids and they did so again on this occasion,&apos;People of this age who have managed without them are, however,often reluctant to make a start with these aids at their timeof life and a not uncommon reaction was a polite but obstinaterefusal;    one old lady said she had not had a tooth in her headfor 50 years and saw no reason for wanting any.   Another repliedthat she could see and hear &quot;as much as God intended&quot;.   However,as a result of the special attention which the officers gave tothe matter many of the old people were supplied with spectaclesor false teeth or hearing aids, and some - a much smaller number - with surgical belts and boots and home nursingappliances,,   A few of the old people were also referred to the blind Welfare services, and, where there was a local branch,to the Deaf or Hard of Hearing Society,One of the most interesting impressions was the extent towhich old people living on their own are visited and befriendedby relatives and neighbours.   Very many of those reported on hadfriends and relatives, some quite a number, with whom theyexchanged visits, and others were members of a church or of a social club.    Allowance must be made for those who, from prideor reserve or for other reasons, are reluctant to admit that noone bothers about them;    and indeed, in about 2,000 instances where there was some doubt&apos;whether the old person really was in regular touch with anybody, the officer was able to arrange fora friendly visitor from the church, or the local old people&apos;swelfare committee or club, or otherwise to put the old person in the way of some welfare contact.   How the arrangement will workout depends almost as much on the old person as on the friendlyvisitor.   Those v/hb were not in regular contact either withrelatives, friends, neighbours, or some church or club, and for whom the officer could make no arrangements, numbered rather lessthan 1,000,7
This small minority who seemed to be really lonely orneglected were, it must be said, often themselves difficult,even disagreeable people, who by actively discouraging callersover a long period had finally cut themselves off from almost all human contacts except the routine ones with the milkman, thepostman, and so forth.    The regular visit every two or threemonths by the Board*s officer is sometimes itself resented.    Bythe time such people have reached the age of 80, they often takea perverse pride in the fact that they &quot;don&apos;t neighbour&quot; and litHecan then be done except to arrange for someone to keep anunobtrusive eye on them.Even if relatives or friends pay frequent visits, theintervals between them must often seem long to an old person,particularly to one who cannot get about much.    Old ageinevitably brings loneliness to many, especially when it is accompanied by some decline in faculties, the loss of a lifetimepartner and the companionship of old friends and contemporaries,which no amount of good neighbourliness or friendly visitingcan altogether replace.    The happiest old people were those whoknew how to fill up their time - cleaning and polishing thefurniture, gossiping in the public house, visiting the cinema,watching the children on the recreation ground.    Most strenuousor more unusual activities reported were &quot;hiking&quot;, bicycling,swimming, &quot;old tyme dancing&quot;, hospital visiting, playing thepiano, making jam, writing plays or poetry, studying languages,keeping goats and mending watches;    but reading and listeningto the wireless were the most favoured occupations, thoughknitting, sewing and gardening ran them close and some of theold people got much enjoyment from television sets.Nearly half the old people said they belonged to a churchor to a social club, and such meeting   places form a most valuable link between a solitary room and the outside world.It is possible that more would attend old people&apos;s clubs iftransport difficulties could be overcome;   but apart from thosewho are too infirm to get about much, there is a large groupwho are not interested, and these are not confined to theungregarious, or the censorious (one of whom described the localclub to the officer as &quot;a gossip shop and marriage bureau&quot;).The overriding impression left on the visiting officers bythis large group of old people is that while a few of them aredistressingly lonely (often perhaps from some eccentricit3r ordefect of personality rather than from neglect by the community)and others, who find it increasingly burdensome to fend for themselves, would undoubtedly be happier and better cared for ina Home, the overwhelming majority are comparatively healthy,independent, reasonably contented? and in frequent touch withrelatives and neighbours;    grumbling a little about the cost ofliving, their rheumatism and the weather, feeling their age andthe disappearance of most of their own generation, but notneglected and not unfriended.    In broad outline the picture whichemerges is not dissimilar from that presented by the report ofthe recent survey by the National Old People1s Welfare Committee,which has already been referred to.    It affords support for theview not only that there has been no decline in the sense ofresponsibility for their old relatives on the part of the youngergeneration but also that there is a positive growth of neigh-&apos;bourliness and community interest in all parts of the country,
l   Kimreflecting the increasing concern for the care of the aged inrecent years.   The reports which the Board have received are on the whole encouraging, but they give no grounds for com-placency;     there must be no slackening of effort, either inthe application of the statutory services, including, of course,those administered by the Board, or on the part of voluntaryworkers, whose services, as the Board have perhaps a betteropportunity than anyone else of knowing   have come to mean somuch to old people^
