(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)*** ^* ** *&quot;*    *^ *^    ^* ^* &quot; *3* ^*SECRETCQPg(55) 105 COPY NO.    ^13th August, 1955CABINETGERMAN INVESTMENTS IN THE IRISH republic memorandum by the Minister of State, Board of trade mr. Norton. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industryand Commerce in the Irish Republic, said last week in Bonn that hisGovernment plan to encourage the establishment of German industries inthe Irish Republic and he specifically mentioned, among the inducementsavailable, the fact that German production in the Irish Republic would getthe advantages of duty-free entry into the United Kingdom and alsopreferential treatment in other Commonwealth countries.    This statementattracted considerable comment in our Press.    Later he added that hisGovernment would be making similar approaches to industrialists in othercountries, notably Sweden and the U.S.A. ;  and that investment by UnitedKingdom firms would also be welcomed.    I have been enquiring about thetrade implications of these statements.2. The policy of encouraging industrial development and attractingforeign investment in order to stem the tide of emigration is not a new policy for the Irish P.epublic,    Foreign investment has also been encouraged inthe United Kingdom and in other parts of the Commonwealth.    Foreignfirms who establish manufacture in the United Kingdom are certainly influ-experienced in part by the fact that goods produced here enjoy preferences inother parts of the Commonwealth, and indeed in the Irish Republic itself.Foreign firms establishing manufacture in other parts of the Commonwealth,for example in Canada, have been influenced by the advantages they willenjoy in the United Kingdom market and in other parts of the Commonwealth.It has been our view that foreign investment of this kind in the Common-wealth and the Sterling Area adds to the general strength and purchasingpower of the Commonwealth as a whole.3. Our tariff commitments to the Irish Republic under the trade agreements of 1938 and 1948 relate to goods &quot;grown, produced or manu-factured in and consigned from the Irish Republic&quot;,    In general, these commitments involve us in giving the Irish Republic Commonwealth treatmenton preferences and free entry.    No distinction is made, or could be made,between goods produced by foreign subsidiaries and goods produced byindigenous firms.    Imports of Irish goods into the United Kingdom aregiven duty-free entry or, if the duties applicable are revenue duties or special duties, preferential rates, so long as they satisfy the conditionsrelating to the granting of imperial preference.    These conditions would normally ensure that goods consisting mainly of foreign parts assembledwithin the Irish Republic would not qualify for duty-free entry or preference.If we wished to alter this, we should have to re-negotiate the Trade agreements of 1938 and 1948 during which we should have to forego some of theprefex*ences we enjoy in the Irish Republic.    Our exports amounted in value to&apos; 105 millions in 1954.
40 Other Commonwealth countries accord preferential treatment to Irish Republican goods whether produced by foreign subsidiaries orindigenous firms.50 It seems doubtful whether Mr. Norton&apos;s attempts to attractforeign capital to the Irish Republic on a significant scale will meet withsuccesso    We know that approaches were made to the Germans inJanuarys 1953 and again at the end of 1954 and that the German attitude was discouraging.    Our Embassy in Bonn have reported this week thatMr, Norton&apos;s recent statements have aroused very little interest inGermany, perhaps because many other countries are clamouring for Germaninvestment.    Moreover, if Germans want to set up manufacture within theImperial Preference area, they might prefer to get more assured positionswithin the United Kingdom, perhaps in Northern Ireland.6. The question of the continued maintenance of duty-free entry for goods imported from the Irish Republic is coming before my colleagueslater in the year when they will be considering the general question of commonwealth duty-free entry.7. Taking separately the question of duty-free entry of Irish goods,I appreciate that it gives rise to special political considerations particularlywhen coupled with Germany.    It is not for me to comment on the political considerations which led to the Irish Trade Agreement of 1948 or on the advisability of telling the Irish Government now that the Commonwealthconcessions in that Treaty were intended for Irishmen and not for Germans.But I must stress that any re-negotiation of that 1948 Agreement would put at risk important preferences which we now enjoy for export trade of anannual value of more than  100 millions.A.R.W.L.\Board of Trade, S.W.I.,12th August, 1955.
