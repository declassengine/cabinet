(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 101 COPY NO. 6 610th August, 1955CABINETROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALSMemorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil aviation have now received from Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve, theChairman of the Disposals Board, his advice on the number of vehicleswhich British Road Services will need to retain to avoid breaking up the trunk services.2.        His advice is that 7,750 vehicles will be required to operate the trunk services.    Under the Act of 1953, the Commission already retains2,341 general haulage vehicles so that the legislation which we shallpromote in the autumn will involve increasing the number of suchvehicles by 5,400.3.       As, under the 1953 Act, the Commission retains 3,500 vehiclesof all sorts, this would involve a total retention of a little under 9,000.4.        These figures are somewhat higher than the figures - 4,500extra and 8,000 in all - which I gave to the House as a general indication,subject to Sir Malcolm&apos;s report, of the order of magnitude involved.5.        9,000 is a little higher than, for political reasons, I should haveliked, and may involve, when we come to the Bill, some compensatingreadjustments of the Commission^ fleet.6.        I have, however, no doubt that we ought to accept, and to announce that we have accepted, Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve&apos;s advice.    I have consulted the Prime Minister who agrees but has directed that theinformation be circulated to the Cabinet.7.        The next list of vehicles for sale (1,500 in all) has been drawnup and will be advertised on 17th August,    It is most important thatpotential buyers should then know what further vehicles will be availablefor disposal.    It is also desirable to carry through the remainingdisposals as quickly as possible.    It is, therefore, very urgent to announce Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve&apos;s advice and the government&apos;s decision on it and, subject to the views of my colleages, I would proposeto do that on or about 16th August.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Transport and civil Aviation, V/, 1.9th August, 1955,
