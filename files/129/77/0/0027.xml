Printed for the Cabinet. September 1955The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of.................... ........... .............................TOP SECRET Copy No.CP. (55) 12720th September, 1955CABINETPALESTINEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a note on the statement on palestine which Mr. Dulles made on 26th August.2. The chief importance of the statement is that it has publicly established the position of the United States Government that the Palestine settlement mustprecede a guarantee for israels security. It has thus brought the American positioninto line with Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy as explained by the PrimeMinister when he was Foreign Secretary in his statement to the House of commons on 4th April.3. It will be seen that, on account of its general character and the competition of news from Gaza and North Africa, Mr. Dulles&apos; statement caused lessexcitement in the Middle East than we had originally expected. This enables usto revert to our original idea of attempting through confidential exchanges to induce the parties to the dispute to agree to our proposals as a basis for negotiation. Representatives of the Foreign Office and the State Department willstart discussion on the future tactics of negotiation in the next few days.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,19th September, 1955.NOTE ON MR. DULLES&apos; STATEMENT ON PALESTINEAt their meeting on 28th July (CM. (55) 27th Conclusions, Minute 2) theCabinet agreed that if Mr. Dulles made a statement on Palestine on the lines ofthe draft which he had communicated to the Foreign Office, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should issue a supporting statement, subject to assurances by theUnited States Government, on:  (a) their ultimate adherence to the Turco-Iraqi Pact; and(b) their readiness to make a substantial financial contribution towards thesupply of British tanks to Iraq.2. These two conditions have been fulfilled. The United States assurance onthe Turco-Iraqi Pact was contained in a letter, dated 19th August, from Mr. Dullesto Sir Roger Makins, the text of which is annexed at Appendix A. In a previousletter of 16th August (reproduced as Appendix B) Mr. Dulles had informed sir roger Makins that the United States Government were prepared to supply ten48769
c0Centurion tanks by off-shore purchase to Iraq during the current fiscal year, onthe understanding that the United Kingdom would supply two. Although this offer was much smaller than we had hoped and been given reason to expect,Mr. Dulles, in a personal message, observed that he regarded it as a start. Onthat understanding we decided to accept it.   .3. The way was therefore clear for Mr. Dulles to make his statement, andfor Her Majesty&apos;s Government to issue a supporting statement on the lines approved by the Cabinet. In the event, Mr. Dulles decided to make his statement in less specific terms than he had originally intended, and to advance the date to26th August. In view of the fact that the revised text of the statement was much less explosive than the draft seen by the Cabinet, I concurred with Mr. Dulles&apos;decision and issued a supporting statement on 27th August.4. The Governments of Australia, New Zealand, France, Ceylon and the scandinavian countries, have publicly welcomed Mr. Dulles&apos; initiative. several other Governments have assured the Americans and us privately of their support.5. The Arab States and Israel have received the statement as well as wecould possibly have expected. There have been no disorders, and no demonstra-tions; and although the Arab press and the &quot; Voice of the Arabs &quot; have handledMr. Dulles&apos; ideas roughly, their criticism has been less violent than on similaroccasions in the past. Some independent politicians and Opposition groups have urged the rejection of what they brand as &quot; imperialist &quot; intrusion into their affairs.But no Arab Government has so far taken up a public position against thestatement. Those who have made public announcements have recognised its importance and stressed the need for careful study and consultation with other arab Governments to define a common Arab attitude. The Prime Minister ofIraq has told us privately that he regards the statement as satisfactory, and thatif the Egyptian reaction is encouraging or even reasonable he will support it and use his influence in favour of some kind of negotiation on the basis of Mr. Dulles&apos;ideas. It is clear that the Arab States await a lead from Egypt; and there hasbeen much talk of convening a meeting of the Arab League to work out a commonArab policy. On 13th September, however, the Egyptian Foreign Minister toldHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the statement would not be discussed in the arab league. Any conversations should be confined to the Egyptian Prime Ministerand himself, to whom we and the Americans were at liberty to put separately ourmore specific ideas whenever we wished. He agreed that a settlement was urgent,and thought that solutions to the refugee and Jerusalem problems would not present much difficulty. But he made it clear that Egypfs minimum demand wasthe re-establishment of territorial continuity, by which he meant the cession ofthe Negev up to Beersheba. No arrangement of corridors would do. ColonelNasser himself had simply expressed his disappointment that the statement shouldhave contained no particular advantage for the Arabs and nothing to which the Israelies could take exception.6. The response of the Israeli Government has been prompt. They have welcomed the statement as a &quot; constructive act,&quot; and are busy seeking detailedexplanations of Mr. Dulles&apos; ideas and trying to dislodge the United States Govern-ment from the position that a settlement must precede a guarantee. They areworried about Mr. Dulles&apos; reference to frontier changes and they are making cleartheir determination to resist unilateral cessions of territory. But, in general, theyare taking pains to show their readiness to examine the possibilities of a reasonable.  This was confirmed by the Israeli Ambassador in London.APPENDIX a text OF LETTER OF 19th AUGUST, 1955, FROM THE UNITED states secretary OF STATE TO H.M. AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTONDear Mr. Ambassador,You will recall our previous conversations and your talk with Mr. Hooverregarding the question of United States adherence to the Baghdad Pact. I also discussed this matter with Mr. Macmillan in Paris.
APPENDIX BTEXT OF LETTER OF 16th AUGUST, 1955, FROM THE UNITED states secretary OF STATE TO H.M. AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTONI refer to our conversations and correspondence concerning Centurion tanksfor Iraq.Off-shore procurement of Centurion tanks faces us with serious financial difficulties because of recent appropriation cuts by the Congress. Nevertheless,we are prepared to purchase in the United Kingdom for Iraq, as part of our grantaid program for the current fiscal year, ten Centurion tanks if the United kingdom will provide two. Also, we will explore the possibilities of expediting deliveries to Iraq under our current program and of adding certain other additional items to this program. Our action with respect to the tanks is not intended to set ageneral pattern for the Near East but only to meet a specific special situation.Members of our staffs can discuss the question of the manner and time forinforming the Iraqi Government.Because of the personal interest Prime Minister Eden has expressed to thePresident, I would appreciate your bringing this letter to his attention.It has been my thought that it was not feasible for the United States to join the Baghdad Pact until there was a relaxation of tension between the Arab Statesand Israel. At that time we would be disposed to seek formal adherence. In the meanwhile, the Arab States in the area know of our support for the Baghdad pact and we will continue to make this support known to them. We are also preparedto establish close liaison arrangements with the Baghdad Pact organisation whenit is set up.Because of Prime Minister Eden&apos;s interest in this matter I would appreciateyour informing him of these views.Sincerely yours,JOHN FOSTER DULLES.
