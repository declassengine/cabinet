Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1955CONFIDENTIALCP. (55) 1455th October, 1955CABINETARMED FORCES: EDUCATION GRANTSMemorandum by the Minister of defence in August 1952 the Cabinet discussed proposals for education grants for the armed Forces submitted by the then Minister of Defence (C.C. (52) 77thConclusions, Minute 6). The question was also touched upon in the discussionslast year with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Service emoluments. Onneither occasion was it possible to reach agreement on a scheme.2. The difficulties of the Service parent arise fundamentally from the frequentmovement to which he is subjected, not only between home and overseas, but alsowithin the United Kingdom. He is seldom in one place long enough to take rootand avail himself of the full facilities provided by a local education authority. he cannot refuse to move on grounds of domestic inconvenience.3. The Service parent, particularly when his children have reached the ageof secondary education, is faced with various possibilities: --(a) He can try to take his children with him and avail himself of the facilities provided. This practically always means constant changes andinterruptions in the children&apos;s education. Moreover, even this unsatis-factory arrangement is not always possible with certain overseaspostings.(b) He can set up a separate home for his wife, while his children attend dayschool. Apart from the extra expense, this is not conducive to acontented or efficient Service.(c) He can try to place the children with a near relative during term time, an increasingly difficult proposition, and one which does not in any casesolve the problem of what to do with the children during the holidaysif the parents are abroad.(d) He can send the children to a boarding school.  This is usually the most satisfactory solution, but the financial burden imposed is beyond themeans of the average Service officer or man.The extent of the difficulties thus experienced by Service parents is illustrated bythe statement reproduced in Appendix A, which is based on the replies given bya representative cross-section of personnel of all ranks to a questionnaire recentlyput to them in confidence at three typical R.A.F. stations. The implications inregard to morale and the desire of individuals to remain in the Service are obvious.4. The Service Ministers and I have considered, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education, whether any satisfactory alternative arrangement to direct financial grants could be devised.A possible alternative scheme was prepared, under which a Central Agency wouldhave to be set up in the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the scottish education Department, to handle all applications by Service parents for help withthe education of their children. This plan might have resulted in some easementof the present problem; but we were advised by the Education Ministers that itwould involve legislation which might be controversial, and that it would be48849Copy No.   gg
difficult to put into effect. Moreover, it would take a long time to bring intooperation. At best it would provide only a partial solution to the problem andit would restrict the parenfs choice of school. These considerations rule out theplan for a Central Agency.5. But the special problem of the Service parent must be recognised; and heshould be given financial assistance to help him to give his children educationallya fair start in life. The principle of financial assistance has already been accepted for the Foreign Service, and for members of the Home Civil Service postedabroad.  Details of the assistance given in these cases are set out in Appendix B.6. We have been under constant pressure in both Houses and from all parties on this matter. The Select Committee on the Army and Air Force Acts,1953-54, urged strongly that a solution to the problem must be found, and the eighth Report of the Select Committee on Estimates for 1953-54 describes it asa major deterrent to regular service. Lord Waverley&apos;s Committee on the ForcesMedical Services found educational difficulties one of the principal reasons for theshortage of Service doctors.7. The Education Ministers are willing to ask local education authorities todeal sympathetically with the difficulties of Service parents. They are also willingto set up machinery to advise these parents how best they can take advantage ofany facilities that may be open to them. My Service colleagues welcome this help.But even if local education authorities were willing to co-operate more fully thanmany of them do at present, their financial assistance depends on an income testwhich debars a large number of officers from any real help.8. We propose, therefore, that Service parents who qualify under paragraph 10 below should be entitled to a grant, as a charge on Service Votes:(a) of up to a maximum of  75 a year for each child between the ages of11 and 18 at a boarding school, or(b) of 10s. a week for each child between the ages of 11 and 18 left withguardians in order to ensure continuity in a day school education.9. We had hoped that, in order to be really effective, these grants could havebeen exempted from income tax, but we understand that the Chancellor of theExchequer would see objections to introducing legislation to make these allowancestax free for parents resident in the United Kingdom. We have, therefore,reluctantly had to accept the position that parents stationed in the UnitedKingdom will have to pay tax on these grants while those overseas will not. this anomaly will undoubtedly lead to serious administrative difficulties, and will reduce the value of the grant for.many parents.10. At the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer we propose to restrictthis scheme to those Service parents who are normally subjected to frequentpostings.  Officials are now working out a suitable formula to cover this.11. We propose, if the Cabinet approve, to introduce the scheme with effect from the Michaelmas Term, 1955, for the  75 grant, and from 1st September, 1955,for the  26 grant, but we should prefer that the scheme should not be announcedpublicly until the details, now being worked out in the Service Departments, havebeen promulgated to those who will be affected by it.12. It is difficult precisely to estimate the cost of our proposals. But sofar as we can judge, it is probable that the cost of the scheme, when in full operation, will be something of the order of  J million annually. We are convincedthat such expenditure would be money well spent.S. L.Ministry of Defence, S.W. I,4th October, 1955.

In many cases parents had been obliged to realise such savingsas they had, to incur bank overdrafts or to surrender insurance policies. Frequentreference was made to the extra expense arising from the need to purchase newschool uniforms, to pay fees in lieu of notice and to provide special coaching.(h) The education of 133 out of the 231 children was said to have beenadversely affected by one or more of the following causes:  (i) Repeated moves from one school to another.(ii) Absence of adequate educational facilities in the neighbourhood of Servicestations.(iii) The low standard of the educational facilities available at some placesabroad.(iv) The different methods of tuition used at different schools.   (Of the 98children whose education was not said to have been adversely affected,two-thirds were below the age of 11.)(i) Practically all parents referred to the need for greater continuity ofeducation.
