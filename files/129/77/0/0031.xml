The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No....4.3C.F.(55) 13120th September, 1955CABINETCAPITAL FINANCE FOR LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerUnder the present system the local authorities can choose the sourcefrom which they borrow to meet approved capital expenditure.    There is no limit to the amount that they raise from the Exchequer through the Public&quot;Works Loan Board (P.W.L.B.) and the rates at which they borrow are   in line with Government credit.2.        I propose to change the system in two respects -(i)       to limit the demands on the Exchequer by asking theBoard to grant loans only when it is satisfiedthat the applicant has made an effort to borrowelsewhere, i. e, in the stock and mortagemarkets, and cannot reasonably do so;(ii)       to prescribe rates for the P.W.L.B, based not on government credit, but on the credit of localauthorities of good standing in the market.3.        The present system dates from 1945, when the local authorities were charged with a programme of reconstruction and housing far in excessof the capacity of the stock and mortgage markets.    For seven years thelocal authorities were in effect denied access to the stock market.    hi1952 they were given back their freedom to go to the market if they wished.But the Government did not take the further step of limiting their access to the P.W.L.B.   The local authorities still had a big programme of commitments authorised by the Government,    Parliament was told that inthis situation the authorities must be given access to all the sources offinance, and that it was not the Governments policy to force local authoritiesinto the stock market,4,        The present system has two disadvantages,5,        First, the authorities have lost the habit of considering before they incur capital commitments how the money to meet them will be found -since the tap is open from which they can draw the money when the commitments mature.    Their sense of financial responsibility is alsoweakened if they borrow at rates which reflect not their own credit but the credit of the Government,
7^6.        Second, the system is unhealthy for the Exchequer.    The deficitbelow the line this year includes  193 millions of capital advances to localauthorities made in six months compared with a Budget estimate for thewhole year of  320 millions.    This drain is not due to any increase in thecapital formation of local authorities which is, in fact, tending to fall.    Itis due to the fact that, when interest rates have been rising, the localauthorities have chosen to concentrate their borrowing on the P.W.L.B.As a direct result, the Exchequer has been obliged to raise these large sumsby increasing the Floating Debt, and this increase has diminished the pressure on the liquidity of the banks and added to the difficulties of credit control.7,        We now have an opportunity to adopt a more healthy system.Local authorities1 capital expenditure may be expected to fall in the next18 months or so, for it is probable that the reduction in housing expenditure will continue while, if the local authorities succeed in carrying out theGovernments request in the rest of their programmes, their other capitalexpenditure will be no larger than it was last year.    This contraction ofexpenditure provides the opportunity for a change in the local authorities1arrangements for raising the capital finance.    The fact that their capital requirements will tend to fall means that a greater proportion of them canbe met from the stock and mortgage markets.    Moreover, we are movinginto a situation in which the local authorities will have a somewhat greaterdegree of freedom to decide for themselves the size of their capitalexpenditures - particularly on housing - and this carries with it a greaterdegree of independence and financial responsibility for the local authorities.8.        This development calls for a corresponding modification of thesystem of financing, for the authorities will no longer be under suchcompelling pressure from the Government to embark upon specificprogrammes of capital expenditure.9.        I therefore propose that the Exchequer should resume the rightto grant or withhold advances to local authorities.    This step does not require fresh legislation.    It can be done by a request.from myself tothe P.W.L.B. who, under the present law, have full power to grant orwithhold advances,10.      At least for the present, I would not propose to revert to the pre-warsystem under which the Board were instructed not to lend (except for certain specified services) to large authorities (defined as authorities with arateable value of more than  200,000 a year).    The larger authorities areresponsible for about half the present advances from the P.W.L.B. - say 150 millions a year.    There can be no assurance that the stock andmortgage markets will find additional finance of this amount.    But Ibelieve it will be feasible to have a selective and flexible system.    Ipropose to ask the Board, before they grant any advances in future, tosatisfy themselves that the applicant has made an effort to raise thefinance on its own credit in the stock and mortgage markets, and only to lend from the Exchequer insofar as, in the Board&apos;s judgment, the applicantcould not reasonably raise the money elsewhere.11.       But I do not think this change will be feasible unless the instruction to the Board is supported by a further step - a change in the basis on whichthe Treasury calculates the lending rates of the Board.    At present therates are based on Government credit for loans of comparable periods.
The result is that - unless an authority decides to pay more for the flexibility and prestige of a market loan - it is to the financial advantageof the local authorities to borrow from the Board as opposed to themarket.    They will certainly claim when it suits them that it is their duty to do so: and the Board will be given a very difficult task in deciding howfar they can press an applicant to go back to the market when the applicantclaims that the markets terms are unreasonable.12.       I believe that the right solution is to prescribe lending rates forthe P.W.L.B. based, not on Government credit, but on the credit of localauthorities of good standing in the market.    This again does not require legislation, as the Treasury has full discretion to prescribe whateverrates they think fit under the existing law.13. Clearly certain safeguards are needed before the new system canbe put into operation.    The main points to be safeguarded are -(a) the market prospects;(b) the effect on local authority credit;  and(c) the administrative arrangements to avoiddislocation of local authority finance.14.       Market prospects.   The success of the plan depends on an activemarket in local authority issues.    The Bank of England have been closelyconsulted on this point.    No assurance can be given of an immediate flow of local authority issues or of consistently favourable markets.    Butthere exists already a list of local authority stocks to go on the market;and there is a reasonable prospect of making steady progress with the orderly flotation of these issues in the first place, followed by others onwhich preparations could start as soon as the new policy was announced.Similarly there are good prospects of an active mortgage market.    Thisis an encouraging report.    But I must emphasize that it is conditional on anew Local Loans rate based on local authority credit.    Progress cannotbe made in either stock or mortgage markets if they have to compete withthe P.W.L.3. lending at finest gild edged rates.15.       Local authority credit.    It is not intended that the pressure ofthe local authorities on the market should drive up their borrowing rates to penal levels.    The authorities are entitled to protection against thatrisk.    They will get protection from the lending rates prescribed forthe P.W.L.B.   Some margin is bound to develop between the full giltedged rate and local authority rates, and it is right that it should.    Butlocal authority credit will continue to rank in the market next afterGovernment credit.    This standing will be reflected in the lending ratesprescribed for the P.W.L.B. , who will be given guidance not to pressapplicants to borrow in the market at rates significantly higher than the3oard&apos;s own lending rate.16.      Administrative arrangements.   I am satisfied that the P.W.L.B.as at present constituted can carry out the function now to be given tothem.    They will not be concerned in the merits of the capital expenditure,but with the market prospects of the local authorities who come to them.In practice the Board will accept the statements of small applicants thatthey were unable to raise their finance elsewhere, and will concentrate
on the large authorities of known market standing.    On these the Board willbe advised by the Bank of England who are in a position to report.on theprospects of such authorities in both stock and mortgage markets.17.      As far as the Board and the Bank are concerned, this system is ready to be put into operation immediately.    From the standpoint of thelocal authorities, however, a transitional period may well be required.    Itis the present practice of many local authorities to decide the amount andsource of their loans only when commitments mature fox payment.    Butthe new system will mean that local authorities must work out forwardborrowing programmes, taking account of their broker&apos;s advice on theprospects of their stock issues, etc. before they can justify the amount oftheir proposed borrowing from the P.W.L.B.   It will also take a little time for the authorities and their market advisers to organise the flow of new issues in the stock market.    Clearly the Board must be ready tomake such advances as are required to help the authorities through thistransitional period.    I would propose to make these transitional arrange-ments by meeting the Standing Consultative Committee of Local authority associations immediately after the new policy was announced.    But toavoid forestalling, the new lending rates for the P.W.L.B. must be prescribed and operate immediately.Summary18.    (i)      Under the present system, there is no limit to the amount of approved capital expenditure that local authorities can finance by borrowing from the Exchequer at rates based on Government credit.(ii) I propose that (a) the Public Works Loan Board should onlygrant Exchequer loans so far as the applicants cannot raise the money inthe stock and mortgage markets; and (b) the Board&apos;s lending rates shouldbe based not on Government credit but on local authority credit.(iii) In order to succeed, the new system requires an activemarket in local authority issues, safeguards against penal rates for localauthority borrowing, and workable administrative arrangements,particularly to begin with.     All these points are covered.(iv)    If the scheme is agreed, I would propose to announce it on27th September and to fix the new Local Loans rates, based on localauthority credit, on the same day.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.
