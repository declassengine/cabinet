^ secret Copy No. 68CP. (55) 1132nd September, 1955CABINETCOLONIAL immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsAs I shall be overseas when the Home Secretary&apos;s paper on colonial immigrants (CP. (55) 102) comes up for consideration by Ministers, I should likebefore I leave to put on record some points which seem to me of importance fromthe point of view of Commonwealth relations.2. The problem faces us with a dilemma: on the one hand, it would presumably be politically impossible to legislate for a &quot; colour bar &quot; and any legislation would have to be non-discriminatory in form. On the other hand, wedo not wish to keep out immigrants of good type from the &quot; old &quot; Dominions,and indeed &quot; two-way immigration &quot; is a policy to which we have always subscribed.3. I understand that, in the view of the Home Office, Immigration Officers could,without giving rise to trouble or publicity, exercise such a measure of discriminationas we think desirable. But everything turns on whom the discrimination is to be against. It would probably be quite easy to discriminate in favour of white membersof the &quot; old &quot; Commonwealth countries. But what is to be the position aboutimmigrants from the Asian Members of the Commonwealth?4. I myself would argue that we should not take any action which would givethe impression that citizens from India, Pakistan and Ceylon are less favourablytreated than citizens from the older Commonwealth countries. I am aware thatthere has been an increase in the last year in the number of working-class Indianscoming here. This is a new development and, unless it is checked, it could become a menace. But the Government of India are genuinely ready to do what they canto stopvimmigration of this type. I have no doubt that the same would be true of the Government of Pakistan. There is also the political angle to be considered.Any suggestion that the United Kingdom were introducing a discrimination basedon colour or race would be certain to provoke strong reactions in the Indiansub-Continent, where feeling is very sensitive. There might well be a danger ofthe Governments of India and Pakistan introducing retaliatory restrictions againstthe entry or residence of members of the British business community (who already have their troubles). The British communities in the sub-Continent are not largebut they are of vital economic importance to us.5. If this is accepted, I would much prefer that the reference to Indians andPakistanis at the end of paragraph 4 of the Appendix to the Committee&apos;s Reportattached to CP. (55) 102 should be deleted. The statement is entirely accurate,but I fear that its inclusion in a public statement might unnecessarily start acontroversy in India and Pakistan which could have awkward repercussions on theBritish communities there.6. In any case, as recommended by the Committee, I should like to giveCommonwealth Governments advance notice of any statement before it is issuedand should wish to reassure them as far as possible about the effect of such legislation on the entry of their nationals into this country.Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street,30th August, 1955.48689Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1955
