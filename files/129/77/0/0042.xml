Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1955CONFIDENTIALCP. (55) 1421st October, 1955CABINETJAPAN: TRADE AND PAYMENTS negotiations note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a report by officials on thepresent state of the negotiations for a new Trade and Payments Agreement with japan.2. Since the resumption of the negotiations, the Japanese have gone a longway to meet our requirements, but there are still a number of important points onwhich further negotiation is required.3. The most important of these is the matter of the trade quotas. As theJapanese will require, as part of any agreement, an assurance from us that theColonies will be free to import Japanese goods up to the limit of their statedrequirements until the end of March 1956, my colleagues will wish to consider what must be secured in the way of quotas for our exports to Japan in order tomake the agreement politically defensible.4. There are also points to be considered in connection with Japan&apos;s treatmentof oil imports and the level of sterling expenditure provided for in her winterbudget.R. A.

report by the Overseas Negotiations CommitteeOn 5th September the Cabinet approved new instructions to be given.toour negotiators, who had been recalled from Tokio (CM. 30th Conclusions,Minute 7). These instructions are set out for convenience in the Annex to thisreport.2. The negotiations were resumed on 8th September. Since then theJapanese have come a long way towards meeting our basic requests. On theundertaking in regard to sterling expenditure the Japanese reply is satisfactory,provided that one point can be met. So far as discriminatory practices areconcerned, they have substantially met our requirements, except in regard to the licensing of machinery imports and the negotiation of exclusive quotas with theindependent countries of the sterling area. There remain two difficult questions,namely, the treatment of the United Kingdom controlled oil companies, and tradequotas. The position under each of these heads is set out below, with recommendations for Ministerial consideration.The Undertaking in regard to Japanese Sterling Expenditure3.   Our objectives under this head were:  (a) To obtain a general statement of intention by Japan to facilitate imports,visible and invisible, from the sterling area to the amount of Japan&apos;total earnings from the area.(b) To obtain a concrete translation of this general undertaking in the sense that the forthcoming winter budget would provide not less than 105 millions for visible imports from the sterling area.(c) To secure that this figure of  105 millions should be broken down intocommodities and values in a way which would satisfy us that realopportunities existed for our trade.4. The Japanese are willing to give, without qualification, the generalundertaking at (a); and as regards (b), they offer an undertaking to provide inthe winter budget not less than  127-5 millions for visible and invisible exports from the sterling area. As regard (c), we have been told, in confidence that theJapanese are planning expenditure of  117-7 millions on visible trade with the sterling area. The main items are raw materials, such as wool ( 22 millions),food-stuffs rice, wheat and barley ( 20 millions), cotton ( 14 millions) and sugar( 2 - 5 millions). This total also includes estimated expenditure on &quot; automaticapproval&quot; imports that is to say, imports on Open General Licence-fromsterling area sources at  32 millions. This compares with the provision of 23-5 millions last year and actual trade of only  16 millions. In addition, theJapanese are planning to spend  25 millions on oil and invisibles making a totalof  142 millions.5. The Committee consider that, in the light of the information given aboutJapan&apos;s winter budget, the figure of  127-5 millions for visibles and invisiblestogether can be accepted as equivalent to at least  105 millions for visibles only.Although the increased provision of sterling for &quot; automatic approval&quot; importsshown in the winter budget does not guarantee that equivalent trade will takeplace, we shall be able to compete for it, because we now have an assurance thatthe United Kingdom and Colonies will be a permitted source of supply for all goods, on &quot;automatic approval,&quot; and a large proportion of such goods areobtainable from Colonial sources. There is, however, one reservation. TheJapanese wish to include in the  127-5 millions sugar bought from non-sterlingsources through London. They put the value of this at  2-6 millions, but it mightbe more. We cannot agree to the inclusion of what are, in effect, payments tothird countries. But even if it proves necessary in consequence to reduce the figure to  125 millions, Departments are agreed that this would still be equivalent to 105 millions for visible trade.recommendation. Subject to the exclusion of sugar purchased through London from non-sterling sources, we recommend that the Japanese answer in regard to sterlingi; 5 88:f*
expenditure be regarded as satisfactory; and that, if necessary, the undertakingcan be reduced to  125 millions for visible and invisible trade exclusive of thissugar. ;Additional Assurances of Non-discrimination7. The Japanese are prepared to give the assurances asked for as set out inparagraph 3 of the Annex, with two main exceptions. These are:  ;   (a) MachineryThe Japanese have not met our request for an assurance thatlicences will not be refused on protectionist grounds, but agree to state,i that &quot; the utmost relaxation will be exercised in the actual applicationof the screening criteria.&quot; Our negotiators advise us that in practice this limited assurance is worth much to us; having given it, theJapanese will not wish to refuse applications which might lead torepresentations from us. On the other hand, it is of little valuepresentationally.(b) Independent Sterling AreaWe sought an assurance that the Japanese would not seek fromindependent sterling area countries exclusive quotas for their exports.The Japanese are not willing to give any undertaking which would tietheir hands in negotiations with other sterling area countries. Theyhave, however, informed us in confidence of the amount of sterlingwhich the) are programming for imports of cotton, and we know thatthis is enough to cover all the cotton that Pakistan hopes to sell. our main object in seeking this assurance is to prevent the Japanesedemanding from Pakistan an exclusive quota for Japanese textiles. Weshould not be able to disclose to the Pakistanis what we know aboutJapanese intentions, but we should be able to say to them in general terms that we believe that the Japanese intend to increase their sterlingpurchases of cotton, and that they will be in a strong position if theyresist any demand for an exclusive textile quota from Japan.recommendation. The advice of our delegation is that these two points should not be pursued further and the Committee concur in this recommendation.Trade Quotas9. \Here the position reached is not at present satisfactory. But it is stillfluid and there may well be scope for further negotiation. Last year, in negotiatingthe current Agreement, we granted import quotas to the Japanese of  3 millions,for grey cloth for re-export after processing and of  1 - 35 millions for manufacturedgoods. The quotas conceded in return by the Japanese for United kingdom exports amounted to only  2 - 4 millions (for wool textiles, whisky andconfectionery). We accepted this imbalance in recognition of the sterling shortagefrom which the Japanese were then suffering. In the present negotiation we haveinsisted that, if we are to continue the concessions granted last time, the Japanesemust, in view of their improved sterling position, offer us at least equivalentconcessions. The Japanese response has been to. offer us a continuation of theprevious quotas for wool textiles, whisky and confectionery, an additional 1 million for machinery and new or increased quotas for a number of miscellaneous items, mainly food, which we also value at about  1 million. thus in terms of money their offer balances the quotas which we are prepared tocontinue. Although we have not secured complete assurances of non-discrimination in the licensing of machinery, these offers should present genuineopportunities for  2 millions additional trade. Many of the smaller Japanesequotas will not help our more important exporting industries. On the other hand,we need the grey cloth which constitutes the major part of our import quotas,although this is still represented to the Japanese as a concession to them. on balance, therefore, the bargain up to this point appears advantageous to us and theCommittee recommend that it&apos; should be accepted.48835b 2
10. Over and above the continuation of their existing facilities for exportingto us, the Japanese want to have the quota for canned salmon increased from theprevious figure of  2 millions to  6 millions and to have various other quotasamounting to  600,000. In return they propose to give us concessions totalling 4 - 6 millions. These include an additional  500,000 for wool textiles, which is a real and difficult concession for the Japanese to make; they also offer smallconcessions on cars, spare parts, motor cycles and poplins and the release of blockedfilm earnings. These concessions are of value to us but they total (including the wool textiles) not much more than  1 million. The balance of the Japanese offer,amounting to over  3 millions, consists of quotas for goods which either we arenot interested in selling, or which the Japanese would buy in any case.11. Canned salmon is a relatively easy item for us to concede and increased supplies would, from a supply point of view, be welcome, as the presentconsumption is much below the pre-war level. Of the small balance of theJapanese request rather over half is for silk goods, a concession which we cannot make. The other items are quite small.12. The Japanese proposal is in effect that we should concede an additionalquota of  4 millions for canned salmon in return for concessions on products of value to us worth not much more than  1 million. The Committee consider thatthis is not good enough. Nor would the offer be attractive even if (which is unlikely) the Japanese were prepared to see their additional canned salmon quotacut down to  1 million, i.e., the equivalent of the concessions on their side whichare of value to us.Recommendation13. The Committee recommend, first, that the bargain over existing quotasreferred to in paragraph 9 above be accepted. Secondly, as regards new quotas,they consider that our delegation should press for at least  2 millions worth(including the items of value to us in the Japanese proposal) of additional newquotas of goods which will be of real value to United Kingdom exporters. this might include increased facilities for motor cars, motor cycles, dyes and chemicals and certain texiles. They should press this claim on the basis of conceding onlythe equivalent value in canned salmon, but should be authorised to concede in thelast resort up to  3 millions for canned salmon, provided that our requirements in regard to oil are satisfactorily met.Oil14. Our objective has been to secure arrangements which give the UnitedKingdom-controlled oil companies adequate opportunity to maintain, and ifpossible to increase, their sales. Under the expiring agreement the Japaneseundertook to provide sterling for the purchase of oil from the United Kingdom-controlled companies to a value of not less than 22^ per cent, of the value of allimported oil; or alternatively, 25 per cent, of the total value of oil supplied fordollars and sterling whichever is the greater. The Japanese have applied thisprovision in a way which we never intended, by obliging the importers to take oil from United Kingdom-controlled companies up to the prescribed ceiling. Thishas led to accusations of market sharing from the Americans. At the same time,while sterling earnings from the supply of oil to Japanese importers have risen,particular importing companies in which there is a United Kingdom interest,notably the Shell group, who distribute refined products through subsidiaries, have seen their share of the distribution market fall because of the method by whichthe Japanese allocate currency for oil imports.15. Our negotiators have therefore been attempting to secure the replacement of the existing practices by arrangements which would provide: &apos;(a) that the import of oil from United Kingdom-registered companies againstpayment in sterling will be freely approved upon application from any japanese importer within his respective quota; and that this intentionwill be made public;(b) that certain discriminatory practices will be abolished, and nothingsubstituted in their place;(c) that the method of determining and allocating quotas to importers shallbe fair and equitable.
16. The Japanese have given us an assurance in the terms of (a) above. On. (b), they have said that they will modify or gradually abolish the &quot; merit &quot;system and that it will not be replaced by anything similar. On (c), they have givenassurances that the allocation of foreign exchange for imports of oil will be basedon each importer^ allocation for the years 1952-54. As an exception to this, theywill make an additional allocation of  164,000 to the Shell subsidiary during theperiod of the agreement. They have stated their intention of increasing the Shellallocation gradually over a period, and meanwhile have offered to continue theminimum percentage arrangements. In earnest of this, they are prepared toearmark 27 per cent, of total oil allocations in the Winter Budget for imports from united Kingdom-controlled companies.17. The view of our delegation in Tokyo is that we have a choice betweeneither:  (a) Getting a substantial increase (to 27 per cent.) in the percentage share ofthe market reserved for United Kingdom-controlled oil companies, anddisregarding any embarrassment this might cause us with the americans; or(b) Dropping the 22^ per cent, and concentrating on getting increased importallocations for the importers linked to United Kingdom-controlled companies, particularly Shell, in order to restore the cuts that theyhave suffered.Our negotiators have advised that in their view the weight of advantage seems to lie in going for course (a). Such a general underpinning of the position would beof definite value to us in that it would afford general protection against Japanesediscrimination, and secure a definite increase in sterling income as against the past year. Moreover, there is no reason why we should not continue to press for,and use any bargaining power at our disposal to secure, improvements in theallocation to particular importers.18. The Committee feel bound to dissent from this view on general principles and on account of the damage that it would do to our relations with United Statesoil companies and the State Department. The goodwill of United States oil companies is of great importance to us all over the world, and if we were toforfeit that goodwill, as we should assuredly do if We took the line advocated by our delegation in Tokyo, the general damage to our interest would far outweigh the advantage we should get from accepting the Japanese offer of a guarantee of27 per cent, of their oil market. The Committee are therefore agreed in recommending to Ministers that the offer of a guarantee of a 27 per cent, shareshould be declined.19. This leaves us with the particular problem of the United Kingdom-controlled oil companies which have close ties with importing companies in Japan.It seems to us that the assurance we have secured at (a) in paragraph 15 alreadygoes a long way towards giving us the substance of what we want. Indeed, theproffered guarantee of 27 per cent, of the market though it is of a larger share ofthe market than we now enjoy might in practice place a limitation upon our operations; and it is even possible that, in the long run, given the freedom to expandthat we have secured under the assurance at (a) of paragraph 15, United Kingdom-controlled companies might sell more than 27 per cent.Recommendation20.  We recommend(i) that the Japanese offer to reserve 27 per cent, of the total oil allocationsfor imports from United Kingdom-controlled companies be declined;(ii) that we welcome the assurances at (a) and (b) of paragraph 15; butcontinue to press for fair and equitable allocations to importers andin particular for the offer made to the Shell subsidiaries to be improvedso that their cuts may be restored on a permanent basis.Invisibles21. On films, the Japanese are prepared to release the accumulated blockedsterling belonging to oUr film companies and to maintain import licences at the
Conclusion23. The Japanese have met a substantial part of the demands which we putforward. At the same time they have stated that their offers are subject to ouragreeing not to call upon the Colonies to restrict their imports from Japan and toour notifying the independent Sterling Area countries that the balance of paymentssituation of the Sterling Area gives no grounds for discriminatory restriction ofimports from Japan. Ministers will, therefore, wish to consider what further concessions on trade quotas are necessary to make the agreement politicallyacceptable. In this part of the negotiation our weapon is the quota for canned salmon. Now that the Japanese have met our requests on the provision of sterling and on non-discrimination and have met the Colonies own requirements, it would clearly be difficult to use the threat of restriction of Japanese imports into theColonies to secure our remaining objectives.Recommendation24. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, has asked for final instructions. TheCommittee recommend that our delegation be authorised to conclude anagreement, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:  (i) As regards trade quotas, that we secure at least  2 millions of newquotas, that are of real value to United Kingdom exporters, if possiblefor a return of an equivalent value (i.e.,  2 millions) in terms ofadditional quotas for Japanese canned salmon; or if it provesnecessary in the last resort and if our other requirements are met,particularly in regard to oil in return for not more than  3 millions ofadditional quotas for canned salmon., (ii) As regards sterling expenditure, that Japanese sterling expenditure on non-sterling sugar, merchanted through London, be excluded from theproposed commitment of  127-5 millions sterling in the Japanesewinter budget. If it is necessary to secure this, we can accept areduction of the figure to  125 millions.(iii) As regards oil, that the system of determining and allocating quotas toimporters be improved with a view to ensuring a fair opportunity for united Kingdom controlled oil companies.If these conditions are not satisfied, the delegation should report back forfurther instructions.present level. This is a valuable concession. The Japanese have also made some concessions on the remittance of business profits and on personal remittances.They have said that they could only agree to our request that Japanese importersshould be freely permitted to use United Kingdom merchanting facilities if wewould agree to count all purchases of sugar on the London market, irrespective ofthe country of origin, against the sum they are required to provide in their sterling area winter budget.  We cannot agree to this (see paragraph 5 above).Recommendation22. The progress made on invisibles, with the opportunities provided forpressure on the Japanese for further relaxations in future, can be accepted as satisfactory.
ANNEXOBJECTIVES IN THE negotiations the following re-statement of the objectives to be sought in the resumednegotiations in Tokyo was approved by the Cabinet, on 5th September:  (a) An undertaking with regard to sterling payments as proposed in cp. (55) 103 (see paragraph 2 below). But the Winter Budget figureof  105 millions should be broken down into commodities and valuesin a way which would satisfy us that real opportunities existed for our trade.(b) A satisfactory agreement on United Kingdom quotas.  It is understoodthat in return for increased import facilities for Japanese canned salmonthe Board of Trade consider that satisfactory United Kingdom quotasshould be negotiable.(c) Import arrangements for oil which give our companies  adequateopportunities to maintain and increase their sales of oil to Japan.(d) A definite move by Japan in the liberalisation of invisible payments to the sterling Area, such as insurance, passenger fares, films, the remittanceof business profits generally, and the treatment of British banks in japan.(e) The removal of discrimination in regard to collateral deposits on importlicences.2. The undertaking in regard to sterling payments referred to in (a) above was as follows:  (i) A general statement of intention by Japan to facilitate imports, visible andinvisible, from the Sterling Area to the amount of Japan&apos;s totalearnings from the Area.(ii) A more specific commitment that Japan will make available for spendingin the Sterling Area in the coming year preferably in the yearbeginning July 1955, but failing that, October 1955-as much sterlingas she has earned in the Sterling Area in the preceding twelve months.(iii) Finally, a concrete undertaking that the winter budget will provide notless than  105 millions for visible Sterling Area imports, i.e.,excluding oil and imports from third ii.e., non-sterling) countries.It was understood that of these desiderata, (i) by itself was not enough, and thatthe general statement of intention at (i) should be translated into concrete terms onthe lines of either (ii) or (iii).3. The Cabinet further agreed that in addition to the objectives stated above,it was desirable to require certain further undertakings from Japan as a safeguard against Japanese discrimination, and in order to ensure that the import quotasobtained from the Japanese would not be frustrated by administrative devices.These undertakings were to be regarded as of not less importance than the other objectives in the sense that satisfaction on non-discrimination was as fundamentalas satisfaction on the other points. These additional undertakings were formulatedas follows:  (i) Colonies(a) Assurance of retention on Automatic Approval (A.A.) of the Colonial, exports now on A.A.(b) Assurance of non-discrimination in dealing with applications for licences to import goods shipped from the Colonies.(ii) United Kingdom(a) Assurance of retention on A.A. of the United Kingdom exports now onA.A.(b) For goods on A.A. or on global quota or non-dollar quota assurance thatno exclusive quotas will be given to other countries for those goods;and that there will be no discrimination in dealing with applications to import goods in these categories from the United Kingdom.
(c) In respect of the machinery global quota an assurance that the screeningCommittee will be instructed to disregard the criterion in their presentinstructions which requires them to reject any application formachinery of a kind which is made in Japan.(d) In respect of any listed goods for which we fail to secure any quotaswhatever an assurance that if quotas for such goods are given to anyother country, we shall receive non-discriminatory treatment.(hi) Independent Sterling AreaRecognition by Japan that it would be inappropriate andunjustifiable that she should seek exclusive quotas for Japanese exportsto the Independent Sterling Area having regard to the state of hersterling balances and the liberal facilities for Japanese exports to theUnited Kingdom and Colonies provided by the Agreement.(iv) Sterling Area as a wholeInclusion of sterling area as permitted source of supply for all goods in A.A. List or in Miscellaneous Lists.c 88fc
