secret.P.(55) 10623rd August, 1955THE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilAll my colleagues must have read with great interest the paper c.P, (55) 98, which has been circulated by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.    At the same time, I would make bold to put an alternativepoint of view - of which I gave the Cabinet some indication at their last meeting (C. M. (55) 28th Conclusions, Minute 2). - to the general policyput forward by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in that paper.He speaks with such authority on the subjects on which he writes in his paper, that it is with the greatest diffidence that I question anything he says.    But, although I fully recognise the importance of reducing the excessive demand for labour and materials - which is the essence of theChancellor of the Duchy&apos;s argument - I must confess to doubts as to themeans by which he proposed to do it.    He advocates, as I understand it,obtaining the necessary reduction of the national overload, in part, bytemporarily slowing down the provision of capital equipment essential for our industry - particularly railways and roads,2,       I cannot feel that this would be right or wise.    No doubt, any government faced with a situation like the present has to try and strike a balance between what is desirable from the internal and the externalpoint of view - and these points of view are not always identical.     ButI should have thought that our external trade must always be the mostimportant of the two.    For it is by that that we exist at all.   Andespecially is this so at the present time.    For we are moving into anera when, with the new discoveries of science, international competitionis going to be more intense than ever before.    Surely, at a time like that, we ought to be steepping up, rather than slowing down - as mayhappen through the &quot;credit squeeze&quot; - the capital equipment of our industries.    This principle should in my view be applied equally tosuch basic industrial services as means of transport which, ifantiquated and inefficient, are bound to lead to increases in industry*scosts. ,3,        If we are to accept the Chancellor of the Duchy*s thesis, whenare our means of transportation ever to be improved?    For many yearswe were told that we could not spend money on our railways and ourroads because times were too bad.    Now we are told that we cannotspend money on them because times are too good.    When shall weachieve that exact balance between good and bad times that will justifyus in embarking on such programmes as are already far advanced inalmost every other country?    Nor can I share the Chancellor of the duchy&apos;s optimism as to the length of the period during which theseCOPY NO.CABINET
measures of restraint will be necessary.    Why one year?    Why not two,or five, or more ?   And, in the meantime, our roads and railways will begetting more and more out of date.    And the same, in greater or lesser degree, may well happen to many of our industries if their rate ofcapital development is slowed down.4.       I cannot but feel that it would be far wiser for us to consider asan alternative approach to this problem a policy which operates not primarily against expenditure on capital goods but frankly againstexpenditure on consumption goods.    If what we want is to discourage theBritish people from blueing their money, surely a policy of selectivetaxation in the form, say, of purchase taxes carefully graded? to produce the results we want (e. g. increased purchase tax on cars), will be far more effective in curbing internal demand and far less deleterious to our power to compete in the markets of the world.5.       Such a policy could moreover be combined with one of furtherencouraging savings which is, after all, by far the healthiest method ofabsorbing surplus demand.    I know that savings have not the appealthat they used to have for the general public.    The steady fall in thevalue of money does not encourage people to put their money by for thefuturej nor, in these days of the welfare State, is it so necessary thatthey should.    But the amount that is still being saved by the small manis very considerable; and it might surely further be stimulated.6.        These are all elementary suggestions.    I only put them forwardbecause I feel very conscious of the dangers which are likely to  Lowfrom the policy suggested by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,and to which the Government seem to be getting to some extentcommitted.S,Privy Council Office, S.W.122nd August, 1955.
