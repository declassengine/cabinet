;&apos;&quot;&apos; why -ZZ2THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1955CONFIDENTIALCP. (55) 1434th October, 1955CABINETNEW HEBRIDES7Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the colonies on 10th August, 1953 (C.C. (53) 48th Conclusions, Minute 4), the Cabinet-(1) endorsed the proposals in C. (53) 225 for an attempt to reach agreementwith the French Government on a revision of the 1914 Protocol whichis the basis on which the Anglo-French Condominium is administered;(2) invited the Lord President to suggest to the French Government that theBritish and French Resident Commissioners in the New Hebridesshould jointly examine, without commitment to either Government, the revision of the Protocol;(3) invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the New Zealand and australian Governments of this approach and to try to find out if therewas any likelihood that the Australian Government would be willingto take over United Kingdom responsibilities, in the territory;2. The Australian Government stated in March 1954 that the Australianinterest in the Condominium continued, but that they would not at present be ableto assume United Kingdom responsibilities in the territory. They wished to bekept informed of the progress of negotiations for the revision of the Condominiumarrangement.3. In C. (53) 225 it was recommended that a final decision about the futureof the New Hebrides should not be taken until the financial and other implications of the proposed revision of the Protocol had been worked out. This revision was examined at Honiara in March 1954 by the British and French high commissioners for the Western Pacific and the British and French ResidentCommissioners in the New Hebrides. They agreed, without commitment to either government, on the draft of a revised Protocol and on proposals for improving the administration of the Condominium. Their recommendations are summarised in the Annex. These have been considered departmentally and, while detailedlegal examination of the draft Protocol has not been completed, it is consideredthat they form an acceptable basis for negotiations with the French Governmentand will assist the administering Powers to discharge their responsibilities towardsthe inhabitants of the New Hebrides in accordance with present-day principles of colonial administration.4. The High Commissioners consider that the Condominium will be able toraise the additional revenue necessary to meet the increased expenditure which their proposals involve. They also proposed that France and the United kingdom should contribute equally towards the cost of a development programme to bedrawn up locally. Further consideration will be given to the extent and proportion48836 copy No. 73
of any United Kingdom contribution when a development programme has beenprepared, and under the new Colonial Development and Welfare Act provision hasbeen made for Colonial Development and Welfare assistance to be extended to theNew Hebrides. Consideration will also be given to the question of raising revenueabove the level so far agreed locally in order to improve the state of the condominium reserves during the course of the next few years. No increase inthe present net cost of the British Service in the New Hebrides is expected to arise from the High Commissioners&apos; proposals, although the United KingdomGovernment may have to accept some small additional contingent liability in orderto overcome difficulties in the way of supplying British staff for the Condominiumservice.5.   We accordingly invite our colleagues to agree (1) that negotiations for the revision of the Protocol and the improvement ofthe administration of the New Hebrides should be entered into withthe French Government on the general lines of the proposals agreed atHoniara between the British and French High Commissioners;(2) that the Australian Government and the New Zealand Government shouldbe consulted as necessary and kept informed.H.

ANNEXNEW HEBRIDESNote on the Honiara DiscussionsMarch 1954The discussions were attended by the British and French High commissioners in the Western Pacific and by the British and French Resident Commissioners inthe New Hebrides. They resulted in general agreement on proposals for the revision of the Anglo-French Protocol of 19.14 and for improving the efficiency of the Condominium administration. These proposals can be summarised underthe following headings:  A. Revision of the 1914 Protocol.B. Scope of Condominium Reponsibilities and Organisation of Depart-ments.C. Finance and Taxation.D. Financial Control.E. President of the Joint Court.A. Revision of the 1914 ProtocolThe principal changes from the 19.14 Protocol are as follows:  (a) The draft Protocol has been considerably shortened and simplified by the omission of certain detailed provisions which are consideredinappropriate for an instrument of this kind.(b) The preamble embodies a brief declaration of aims.(c) The draft provides that the native inhabitants shall enjoy equal rights of residence, personal protection and trade with nationals of the administering Powers and provision is made for the native inhabitants,when outside the Condominium, to receive the diplomatic protectionof either of the signatory Powers.(d) Provision is made for the establishment of an Advisory Council.   its functions would be purely advisory, but the Resident Commissionerswould be required to consult it about new taxation and the annualbudget. The Honiara Conference proposed that the two Resident\x Commissioners should be the Presidents of the Council, presiding atalternate meetings, and that there should be 10 members, comprisingtwo Heads of Departments of the joint administration, four members appointed from among the Franco-British population and four members appointed from the indigenous population, all appointmentsbeing made by the two Resident Commissioners.(e) The annual Condominium budget is to be subject to the approval of the signatory Powers.(/) The joint administration is given specific power to raise loans.(g) It is provided that joint regulations must be compatible with theprovision of the Protocol, provided that regulations to give effect to international agreements which have been extended to the New&apos; Hebrides shall have effect even though they conflict with the provisionsof the Protocol.(h) Provision is made for the development of local government institutions forthe native inhabitants.(i) Specific provision is made empowering the High Commissioners- to make regulations regarding arms, liquor and labour matters. This enables. the detailed provisions in Articles 31 to 61 of the 1914- Protocol to be dispensed with. Consideration is now being given to the labourregulations which will be required to replace those which it isproposed to delete from the Protocol.48836
(/&apos;) The provisions for the administration of justice and the registration of landclaims are simplified.(k) There is no provision regarding mines and mining in the 1914 Protocol. Itis proposed to vest the ownership of minerals in the joint administration and provision is made for the issue of mining regulations.The draft protocol is now being examined with a view to preparing a definitive text for discussion with the French Metropolitan authorities.B. Scope of Condominium Responsibilities and the Organisation ofDepartmentsThe High Commissioners discussed whether the Condominium should assumegeneral responsibility for Government services in the New Hebrides, instead ofthe present system whereby some services e.g., agriculture are provided by the condominium Administration, and others e.g., medical services by the NationalAdministrations. The conclusion reached was that, while joint services should bethe aim of policy, in view of the practical difficulties they should be institutedgradually rather than by a radical alteration of the structure of the CondominiumAdministration. In particular, it was decided that the Condominium should notat present take over responsibility for education and medical services, thoughfinancial assistance given by the Condominium Administration to the NationalAdministrations and the Missions for these purposes is to be increased, providedsufficient revenue is forthcoming from the Condominium.A number of improvements in the Condominium Administration in order topromote efficiency and economy were proposed, including the creation of a jointCondominium Secretariat, and the amalgamation of the Treasury with the CustomsDepartment, the Works Department, and the Marine Department and the LandsDepartment with the Survey Department.C-Finance and TaxationThe revised 1954 Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of the Condominiumprovided for revenue of  278,000 and expenditure of  304,000. At the end of 1953the Condominium^ liquid surplus balances were  242,000; they had decreasedsubstantially during the two preceding years. The administrative changessummarised at B above, if fully implemented would, on the basis of the 1954Estimates, increase expenditure to  368,000. It was therefore agreed to set up acommittee in the New Hebrides to recommend ways of raising the additional revenue by local taxation, and agreement Was also reached on the importance ofmaintaining a balanced budget. A number of new taxation proposals havesubsequently been agreed between the Resident Commissioners in connection withthe 1955 Estimates, which also include provision for a number of the administrativechanges proposed at the Honiara Conference. These Estimates provide for revenue of  367,000 and expenditure of  355,000, but the question of increasingthis revenue, in view of the need to improve the Condominium^ reserves, is to beconsidered.The High Commissioners envisaged a development programme of  500,000during the period 1955-60, in addition to expenditure of  400,000 on a new wharfwhich is to be financed by means of a loan on the London market. They proposedthat the programme should be financed in equal proportions by grants from theColonial Development and Welfare Fund and its French equivalent. Theprogramme would be drawn up locally by the two Resident Commissioners forconsideration by the metropolitan Governments. The extent and proportion ofany contribution under the new Colonial Development and Welfare Act towardsthe cost of the development programme by the United Kingdom would beconsidered when a programme had been drawn up.D. Financial control agreement was reached on the need for more effective control of the condominium^ finances and M. Sanner, an Inspector of the Ministry of OverseasFinance, who attended the Honiara Conference, undertook to draft the necessary financial instructions, taking into account the advice already given by theAccountant of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate and the recommendationsof the New South Wales Audit Department.
E. President of the Joint court the draft Protocol simplifies the machinery for the administration of justice and the settlement of land claims. These proposals involve reviving the post of neutral President of the Joint Court, which has been unfilled since 1939, sinceexperience has shown that the Court cannot function efficiently without a President.The Australian Government, which has a close interest in the settlement of landclaims in the New Hebrides, has stated that it has no objection to these proposals,subject to the clarification of a point about the procedure of the Court.A.
