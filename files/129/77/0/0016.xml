m(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 116 COPY NO. j 03rd September, 1955CABINETECONOMIC SITUATION: HOUSING policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have considered housing policy carefully in the light of our discussions at last Friday&apos;s Cabinet (C,M,(55) 29th Conclusions, Minute 1),It may be helpful if I put forward some suggestions,    I have not yetdiscussed these with the Ministers concerned, but I plan to do so onMonday morning.    At this time of year such meetings are not easilyarranged; and, since Monday&apos;s Cabinet will be the last before I leave forIstanbul, I had to circulate my views at once.    My suggestions are not, Ithink, inconsistent with the general line of policy which the Minister of housing was indicating last Friday,2, I think it is common ground that we must make a majoradaptation in our housing policy.    This is made inevitable by the economicsituation.    Housing represents such a large part of our total capital investment that we must reduce the amount of effort put into it in men and materials.    The scale of this effort is shown by the fact that total invest-ment in new housing in 1954 was  636 millions (United Kingdom),    Thelocal authorities1 capital expenditure in 1954 on subsidised housing was 3 75 millions. compared with  215 millions for all their other capital expenditure - schools, roads, water and sewerage, trading services, etc.    Indeed, a significant part of this other expenditure is forthe provision of services for the new housing estates built by privatedevelopers and local authorities;  so that a slackening of the pace in housingat once gives extra saving elsewhere,3, A big reduction in the housing lead is the most effective singlestep we could take against inflation, and we must certainly do it.    But wemust do this in a manner which leads constructively to the next phase in theGovernments housing policy.    Indeed, many of us have been of the opinionthat the time was becoming ripe in any case for a reformation of our policy.This need for a timely reassessment is particularly important because ofour outstanding success so far.    By the end of next year, in five years of conservative rule, over if million houses will have been built in GreatBritain - compared with a million in six years by our predecessors.    Wehave honoured our political promise precisely and without reservation.This gives us great authority in charting our course,4. I found myself in general agreement with the Minister of Housingabout the next phase in housing policy.    If I understood him right, he was proposing to concentrate the subsidised effort entirely on special needs,i, e,,slum clearance and the problems of the overspill towns.    Outsidethis field of subsidised housing, there would be no building controls, and
the amount of building would depend upon normal market forces.    I think we would all agree that a necessary element in this freer system is further progress in the freeing of rents.    The elimination of general housing subsidies and the relaxation of rent control are very closely linked.5. In this new freer system a Government commitment to a specific target of housing output seems hardly appropriate.    The numberof subsidised houses built for slum clearance etc. , will depend upon theway in which the local authorities&apos; plans develop and upon the amount ofpublic investment which can be afforded - just the same as schools orhospitals or roads.    The number of private houses built will depend uponthe market.    It would be inconsistent with this kind of policy for theGovernment to attempt to lay down a national target figure.    The nationaltarget policy was right at a time when the economy was strictly controlled by physical controls, and when the pressing social need was to get morehouses built, using all the devices both of planning and of freedom for doing so.    But with If million houses achieved, and with freedom restored to building and the subsidy concentrated on a specific social need, thenational target nc longer has meaning,6. This would mean that after, say, the end of 1956 the 300,000target would no longer govern our policy.   At my colleagues requestI endorsed this target in my statement in the House of Commons on26th July.    I do not see great embarrassment here, for the 300,000 figurewill, I understand, be substantially exceeded this year, and this year&apos;s&quot;starts&quot; will probably result in completions of the order of 300,000 in1956.   -7. In my view, the real problem is how to make a smoothtransition to the new freer system,    I think it is most important to intro-duce at once as substantial a relaxation of rent control as we can - this is sound housing policy, for it makes better use of the existing stock ofhouses, but it is also a valuable disinflationary measure,    I agree with theMinister of Housing that it might be expedient to taper off the &quot;general needs&quot; housing subsidy at a much lower rate over a period of two years.But we must not by so doing prevent the big reduction which would other-wise take place in the number of &quot;starts&quot; of subsidised houses in 1956.It seems that about 100,000 subsidised houses a year (England and Wales)would be enough to carry out the slum clearance undertakings in our election manifesto together with the requirements of the new towns and expanded towns; I would hope that the number of &quot;starts&quot; in 1956 would bereduced to about this figure (compared with about 150,000 in 1955),    Thisis where we get the vital disinflation,8. The suggestion was made at our last meeting that the number of&quot;starts&quot; would fall to the required extent simply as a result of the curtail -ment of subsidy.    This might well be so in the next year or two if the&quot;general needs&quot; subsidy were being abolished immediately, but I amcertain that we could not rely upon it if this subsidy were being continued for a limited period, although at a substantially reduced rate.    I see nocompelling reason for announcing the amount of subsidised housing to be permitted in the next year or two, but I am quite certain that this, like allother capital expenditure by the local authorities and by the Government,must be controlled, although it may be that with a narrower scope of subsidy a less cumbersome technique of control might become possible,9. It follows froin this that we cannot forecast now exactly how many houses we shall build in 1957. It is also clear that if we pursue adisinflationary policy, the total number of houses to be completed in that
year will be less than 300,000.    But even if so it will still be more thanthe total number of houses built by the Socialist Government (which was200,000 a year in 1949, 1950 and 1951).10.        I have not been able to consult the Secretary of State forScotland.    What is said about housing policy above would generallyapply to Scotland as well as to England and Wales; it would be necessaryin Scotland also to concentrate the subsidised housing upon the most urgent social purposes, and to discontinue the &quot;general needs&quot; subsidy.But I would expect the Secretary of State for Scotland to say that it willnot be possible to bring forward new subsidy legislation for Scotlanduntil the Sorn reforms of rating and valuation have been enacted.    In themeantime, the important point is to ensure that the volume of subsidisedhousing in Scotland continues to fall, and that the expectation of the ending of &quot;general needs&quot; subsidy does not lead to increased demands from localauthorities to take advantage of the subsidy while it still exists,;R.A.B..Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,2nd September, 1955,
