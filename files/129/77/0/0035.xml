Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1955SECRET Copy No.     62CP. (55) 13524th September, 1955CABINETROAD PASSENGER TRANSPORTMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorBy direction of the Prime Minister a Committee of Ministers was established under my chairmanship &quot; to consider whether the British Transport commission should relinquish its control over certain road passenger transport companies, andto report to the Cabinet.&quot;The Present Position2 Under the Transport Act, 1947, the considerable shareholdings in buscompanies previously owned by the railways were vested in the British transport commission (B.T.C.). (This was in addition to London Transport which were vested in B.T.C. separately.) Under this Act, B.T.C. were also given power to propose areaschemes for the compulsory acquisition of bus companies in private ownership.These schemes were subject to a procedure for local objections&quot; and parliamentary approval, and it soon became clear that they would not be practicable in theabsence of greater public support. The B.T.C. therefore bought the remainingshares in certain groups of bus companies of which they were already part ownersby ordinary commercial process. Apart from London Transport, the presentposition is that of some 72,000 buses and coaches operating outside London, theB.T.C. own and control 15,000. The largest private concern is the British ElectricTraction Company, Ltd. (B.E.T.), who have sole ownership of 1,200, and controla further 12,000 which they own jointly with the B.T.C.3. The Transport Act, 1953, abolished the powers for area schemes, barredB.T.C. from acquiring any more bus companies without the consent of the Ministerof Transport, and (under Section 18 (6)) gave the Minister power to compel B.T.C.to divest itself of those of its shareholdings in bus companies which gave it controlover them. The question for decision is whether this power should now beexercised.The Case for Denationalisation4. Since 1951 there has been a good deal of pressure, mainly from privatebus companies and in particular from B.E.T., for the return of B.T.C. buses to private enterprise. It is alleged that there is some deterioration of standards,which will accelerate as old managements are replaced by those appointed by theCommission, that the B.T.C. have a transport monopoly which should be broken,and that bus interests are subordinated to those of the railways. It is also claimed that the sales of private interests to B.T.C. were made &quot; under duress &quot; but thatdepends on how real the bus companies considered the threat of area schemes to be. It is now argued that the return of the Government with an increasedmajority makes this a good time to return the control of bus companies to privateenterprise, and at present a majority of the Parliamentary Party&apos;s transport committee are in favour of this course. However, there is little demand from thegeneral public for any change. Indeed, most people do not know who owns their local bus company.48797
1^9House of Lords, S.W. 1,23rd September, 1955.The Case Against Denationalisation5. It can be seen from the figures in paragraph 2 that B.T.C. do not in factenjoy an overall transport monopoly so far as buses are concerned. On the otherhand in certain areas, notably Eastern and South Western England and inScotland, Commission owned and controlled companies do exercise something ofa local monopoly. There is, however, no real evidence of any deterioration. TheThesiger Committee who were appointed to consider the working of the licensing system under the Road Traffic Act, 1930, reported that the view &quot; that theCommission control has in practice materially affected the services provided forby the public under the licensing system &quot; was not established. Again, sinceB.T.C. does not interfere in the ordinary management of the bus companies itcontrols, the subordination of bus to railway interests does not in practice exist.The arguments in favour of denationalisation are therefore not very persuasive.6. There are in addition sound reasons why B.T.C. should not be deprived ofcontrol over bus companies. First, where it is essential, in the interests of efficiency of the railways, to close down uneconomic branch lines, B.T.C. have an incentive to reduce their losses by substituting a bus service, even if this may not beprofitable. But they are only in a position to do so if they control a bus companyoperating in the area; it would be much more difficult to persuade a private company to run an unremunerative bus route to take the place of an uneconomicrailway line. Secondly, if the Minister were now to exercise his powers underSection 18 (6) of the 1953 Act, this would be a considerable blow to the morale and prestige of B.T.C. at a time when they have considerable difficulties on their hands. Thirdly,, it would deprive them of a net sum of about  2 million a yearwhen they are already in considerable deficit.Implications of Maintaining the Present Position7. We therefore take the view that, on merits, the Minister should not exercise his powers under Section 18 (6) of the 1953 Act and B.T.C. should beleft with their present control of their companies. Such a policy would, of course,disappoint many Government supporters, as well as the private interests concerned,who may claim that the Conservative Party, when in Opposition, gave undertakingsnot merely to halt, but to reverse, the process of nationalisation of the buses. Itwould be fiercely criticised by the B.E.T. who have considerable financial interests at stake. (A selection of statements made on behalf of the Party is contained inthe Annex.) We do not think that this interpretation of these statements is justified, or that it should outweigh the balance of argument againstdenationalisation.8. The full facts and the implications of the exercise of the Ministers powers under the 1953 Act (which might well be to set up a private near-monopoly) havenot yet been explained to the Conservative Party Transport Committee since ithas not been possible to do so until a Government decision has been made. Ifthe Cabinet accept our view, we suggest this should now be done.9. We do not, of course, propose that the Government should undertakethat the powers under Section 18 (6) of the 1953 Act would not at any time beexercised. It might, in different circumstances, become desirable to require B.T.C.to give up control of road passenger transport or of particular companies owned by them.Recommendation10.   We accordingly recommend (i) that for the present B.T.C. should not be required to give up itscontrol of road passenger transport companies;(ii) that the Minister of Transport should take suitable opportunities to explain the Government^ policy on this issue in presentcircumstances to the Transport Committee of the ConservativeParliamentary Party,K.
^ I oANNEXSTATEMENTS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSERVATIVE party on ROAD PASSENGER TRANSPORTWhat has been said:  (a) In March, 1949. Sir David Maxwell Fyfe at Newcastle.&quot; I have, with full authority, committed the Conservative Partyto return transport services to local authorities and companies // theyare nationalised.&quot;(b) In April, 1949.-&quot; 50 Things the Tories will do &quot;.&quot; Will oppose any attempt to nationalise road transport services,as this would inevitably mean higher fares. If the Socialist attempt should temporarily succeed, Conservatives will return the affectedservices to municipal and private ownership.&quot;(c) In July, 1949.-&quot; The Right Road for Britain &quot;.&quot; The Conservative Government will stop any further plans fornationalising omnibus and tram undertakings and, wherever possible,will return those already nationalised at the time of the GeneralElection to their former owners, whether local authorities or privateenterprise.&quot;(d) In .1950 the election manifesto. &quot; This is the Road &quot;.&quot; The nationalisation of bus and tramways will be halted.Wherever possible, those already nationalised will be offered to their former owners, whether private or municipal.&quot;(e) Between the two elections of 1950 and 1951 the Conservative ParliamentaryTransport Committee produced for the Advisory Committee on policy a document which was not published.   It said &quot; We intend to take power to sell, either in whole or in part, thoseroad (passenger) transport undertakings which have already been acquired by the Commission.&quot;(f) October, 1951.-&quot; Britain Strong and Free &quot;.&quot; The proposals for placing passenger transport services nowrun by local authorities and local companies in the hands of regional boards will be abandoned.&quot;
