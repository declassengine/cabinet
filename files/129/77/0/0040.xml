Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1955SECRET Copy No. 64CP. (55) 14030th September, 1955CABINETLONDON TRAFFIC CONGESTION: PARK LANE scheme memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation at their meeting on 26th July (CM. (55) 26th Conclusions, Minute 9) theCabinet (i) Agreed in principle that there was need for major road improvements to relieve traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner, Park Lane andMarble Arch.(ii) Recognised that these improvements would involve some encroachmenton the amenities of the Royal Parks, but considered that, as a tunnelhad now been added to the earlier proposals, it might be possible tomodify the scheme in such a way as to reduce its interference withamenities.(iii) Invited me to hold discussions for this purpose with representatives ofthe Ministry of Works, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government,the Road Research Laboratory and the London County Council, andto report the results to the Cabinet before the end of September.2.   These discussions have been held and this paper embodies my report.3. A number of modifications of the existing scheme and alternatives to it have been examined to see whether the interference with amenities could bereduced. Subject to the matter dealt with in paragraph 4, the conclusion reachedwas that there was no variant of, or alternative to, the present scheme which wouldadequately solve the traffic problem at reasonable cost and yet interfere appreciablyless with existing amenities. The experts agree that the provision, of an underpasswould not justify dispensing with the proposed new roundabout or some similarlayout. There may of course be minor modifications in the scheme which can beeffected as it progresses, but these would not materially affect either the look ofthe project or its effect on amenities.4. In our prolonged previous consideration of the scheme it was assumedthroughout both that the interference with the Park must be kept to a minimum and that the Decimus Burton screen should not be moved. In the course ofdiscussion it was however suggested that consideration should be given to analternative scheme involving moving the screen. Although no detailed scheme could be worked out in the time, there seems little reason to doubt that if this were done and a further sacrifice made of amenity and of land in the Park a much larger roundabout could be constructed with an even greater increase in trafficcapacity.5. I remain of the opinion, which I have held since last autumn, that, whileit is urgently necessary to carry out work improving traffic conditions at and between Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch, any scheme for so doing mustinterfere with the Park only to the smallest degree consistent with dealing withthe traffic problem. For this reason, in the light of the conclusions of the expertsset out in paragraph 3,1 still consider that the L.C.C. scheme should be approved,and work authorised to begin as soon as possible.48828
1-86. If, however, my colleagues take the view that the desirability of dealingon a larger scale with the needs of traffic justifies both the removal of a well-knownLondon landmark and a larger use of the Park for traffic purposes than seems tome necessary, it would no doubt be desirable to prepare, in conjunction with theL.C.C., a further scheme involving these sacrifices..7. Jn view, however, of the urgency of starting work on whichever schemeis decided upon at the earliest possible moment, particularly because of the considerations in paragraph 5 of my memorandum CP. (55) 91,1 would urge thatno further time be taken in detailed examination of such a scheme unless theCabinet feel that this greater sacrifice of amenity could be faced. We are already under severe criticism for our delay in coming to a decision on this issue, and,clearly, it would be unfortunate to spend further time in the detailed working outof plans which would be, whatever their traffic merits, unacceptable on amenitygrounds.8. I may add that further consideration of the aesthetic aspect of the L.CC.scheme is far from discouraging. The present barren area of paving at Hyde ParkCorner is hardly the most imaginative or pleasing layout which could be contrived.I feel confident that with the advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission the junctioncould be remodelled with some improvement in amenities. In particular, a centralreserve and large roundabout offer considerable scope for good landscape treatment which, in the vicinity of Hamilton Gardens especially, could largely restore whatthe scheme would damage. And, as above indicated, the L.C.C. scheme has theadvantage of making the smallest interference with the Park of any scheme whichcould do the job from a traffic point of view.J. A. B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,30th September, 1955.
