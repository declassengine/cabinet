secret.P.(55) 109 COPY NO.   [%24th August, 1955&quot;CABINETJAPAN: TRADE AND PAYMENTS negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign, affairs in their discussion on 15th August of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s note C.P,(55) 103 the Cabinet asked me to reconsider thedecision that the shipping question should not be raised again in the courseof the negotiations for a new Trade and Payments Agreement (C.M.(55) 28thConclusions, Minute 7),    Officials were accordingly asked to look at theproblem again in the light of recent developments.    The following are theirviews with which I agree,2, The factors we must take into account are:-(a) Our aim is to get Japan to stop subsidising theoperation of her shipping services and not tobuild up her merchant fleet to an uneconomicextent.    This is a long-term problem.Shipping is a vital national interest to Japan,We are not going to be able to get satisfactorylong-term assurances from her in the context ofa short-term agreement unless we are ready tomake the question a breaking point or indeed togo further,(b) For if we break and do nothing further, the UnitedKingdom will suffer more than Japan,    Our object in the present negotiations is to persuade theJapanese to spend more in the sterling area and toreduce her present discrimination against importsfrom the sterling area.    If we were to confine our action to breaking off negotiations the japanese would be free to discriminate even more heavilyagainst sterling area imports while the sterling area continued to import from Japan at the present level.    Her sterling balances would increase rapidly and we should have failed to benefit United Kingdomand sterling area trade which is our object in thesetalks,(c) We should thus be pushed to impose restrictions on japanese exports. If these were limited to exports to the United Kingdom the extent to whichwe could hurt Japan&apos;s trade without damaging ourown economy (perhaps  10 millions a year) wouldnot be enough to make Japan change her mind andmoreover would be certain to incur retaliation against our own exports,
(d) If we were prepared to threaten the impositionof severe restrictions of colonial imports from japan (roughly  100 millions a year) this might indeed be decisive.    But this would involve theuse -  or the threat -  of import restrictionson the Colonies for other than balance of paymentsreasons which would be contrary to establishedpolicy.    Moreover, it seems very unlikely that theColonies principally involved would agree, in theinterests of British shipping, to do without imports which they need.(e) Thus we might find ourselves not only without a tradeand payments agreement, which we need more thanthe Japanese, but further drawn into a kind of tradewar with the Japanese and on an issue which theycould represent as interference with their domesticpolicies.    Economically this could do both sides greatharm and politically it would be calamitous.    we already discriminate against Japan; we have invokedArticle XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade against her:  if we now pick a quarrel with theJapanese on the shipping issue the Japanese may wellconclude that we are irreconcilably hostile to them and determined not to let them re-establish themselves.We would be pushing them into the hands of the communists.    And we should not succeed in helpingour shipping interests.3. Ministers agreed last month (on individual submissions) thatour representations on shipping should be made through the diplomaticchannel by H. M. Ambassador in Tokyo in a formal Note and that in the tradetalks, while the delegation should refer to this Note and stress the import-ance of the shipping question, they should state that these questions wouldnot be further pursued in the trade and payments negotiations.    Action wastaken accordingly.    It would be embarrassing to go back on it while we areawaiting the Japanese reply.    To postpone the resumption of negotiationsuntil the Japanese have replied to our Note would gain us nothing unless wewere prepared to do without an agreement if the reply was not fullysatisfactory.conclusions, We could not effectively negotiate on the shipping issue inthese trade talks without making it a breaking point and to make it a breakingpoint would have the grave economic and political consequences set out above.Recommendation5. I recommend that the shipping issue should not be raisedfurther in the course of these negotiations but should be pursued separatelythrough the diplomatic channel and on other suitable occasions,H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.24th August, 1955.-id-
