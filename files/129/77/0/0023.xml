(THIS DOCUMENT XS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 12314th September, 1S55CABINETINDUSTRIAL, relations note by the Prime MinisterAt their meeting on 5th September, the Cabinet invitee! theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister ofLabour, to circulate a draft of a White Paper on industrial relations in the present economic situation.    The Chancellor of the Exchequeraccordingly arranged for the preparation of a draft White Paper,2.        I now circulate such a draft, together with a covering noteby the Financial Secretary, Treasury, which describes the originsand aims of the Paper, and sets out the main points which the Cabinetneed to consider,3,        I have not yet had an opportunity of reading the Paper myself;but in view of the possible timing of its publication I consider it important that the Cabinet, without going into details, should have a preliminary discussion of its tone and contents at our meeting onThursday, 15th September,\A.E.COPY NO,10, Downing Street, S.W.1,14th September, 1955,

This draft White Paper has been pi-prepared in accordance withthe directions of the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations,who instructed officials &apos;*To examine the possibility of malting a state&quot;ment of Government policy, in the form of a White Paper or otherwise,on industrial relations in present economic circumstances&quot;,2.        The draft deals not with the legal and jurisdictional aspectsof industrial relations, but with the economic forces which tend to generate discontent and unrest in industry, i, ea the familiar questions ofwages and dividends, costs and prices, and so forth - it endeavours topresent them in a fresh light in such a way that they can be seen inrelation to the longer-term issues involved,3,        The White Paper is, deliberately, a long-term document, dealingwith the problems which a fully employed economy must solve if it isto continue to make progress without strain,    (This does not mean that it has no topical reference.    Indeed, if it were decided to publishit more or less simultaneously with the announcement of the furthereconomic measures which are now envisaged, it would provide a convenient means of setting those measures in the right perspective),4.        The document is concerned to explain and not to preach.It endeavours to set out the relevant facts as objectively as possible,and to leave the public to draw their own conclusions,5,        The essential points for decision are:-(a) Whether this is the sort of document which Ministerswish to see published.(b) If so, when they would like to see it published,6,        Much work has been done on its preparation, and it is as wellbalanced as it seems possible to make it.    The purpose of the notes which follow is not to make a full summary of the document, but to singleout for the attention of the Cabinet those ideas in it which are most difficult to handle objectively, and which therefore deserve particularconsideration.(i)   Appendix I attempts to describe what the state of the economy may be in ten years1 time, if all goes well.This is a purely technical document, which analyses,in conventional national income terms, the possiblenational product of 1964 and the possible claims upon it by the various sectors of the economy.    this appendix is explicitly not a prediction or a promise of what will happen;  it is simply illustrative of what may happen on two alternative assumptions about thelevel of productivity which we achieve.    nevertheless it can inevitably be attacked, from the purelytechnical point of view, at those points where it has hadto attempt a definite statistical measure of, e, g, thefuture growth of imports, the future level of government expenditure (which is shown as unchanged), the futureexpansion of investment, and so forth.    All of these
figures can be argued to be too large or too small or unrealistic in some other respect;and to the extent to which the Appendix can bemisrepresented as a definite prediction this sort of attack may discredit it to some extent.Even if we assume that the Appendix is accepted as being no more than illustrative, it giveshostages to future political fortune; and it needs to be considered carefully, from this point of view,whether it should be included.(ii)   Section II of the draft analyses the course ofprices since the end of the war.    If this analysis is to be fair and impartial, it mustrefer to the effects of the 1949 devaluationand to the results of the reduction of the food subsidies in 1952.    These references havebeen inserted, as briefly as possible.(iii)   Section III describes the movements in thevarious types of income since the end of thewar,    All the statistics in this Section arederived directly from the Blue Boole on national income and Expenditure, and they have beenchosen to give as objective a picture as possible.But the treatment of dividends in relation to wagesneeds to be carefully scrutinised, since that termis here interpreted in the way in which theordinary man understands it (i. e. as dividends onPreference and Ordinary shares) and not in themore technical sense.in which it is often used,(i. e. as including interest as well as dividends).(iv)   Section IV briefly describes the probable effects,both at home and abroad, of an indefinitecontinuance of rising prices.    The overseaseffects, which are reflected, of course, in thebalance of payments, cannot fairly be describedwithout some reference to the fact that, if ourprices rise to a point at which we lose our export markets and if we simultaneously insist on maintaining full employment at home, the onlysafety valve is the exchange rate, i. e., anotherdevaluation.    This reference has been inserted,at the end of paragraph 25.    It needs carefulconsideration.&apos; (v)   Section V deals with the responsibility of Governmentand of both sides of industry in these circumstances.What it says is fairly obviously what needs to besaid.    But the tone in which it is presented is all&quot;important.H.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.14th September, 1955.
) (f6SECRETANNEXSixth draft the IMPLICATIONS OP FULL employment.    Full Employment since 19451.      The White Paper on Employment Policy (Cmd.6527), issued bythe Coalition Government in May 1944, set out the policies to be pursued after the war to maintain a high and stable level ofemployment.      The experience of the past ten years has shown that full employment can be maintained but that it has created new and serious problems of its own.2.      Since the end of the war, this country has enjoyed full employment to a greater degree than most people would previouslyhave thought possible.     From 1945-55 unemployment has never(except for a few weeks in 1947) exceeded 3 per cent;    for mostof the period it has been under 2 per cent;    and it Is now littlemore than 1 per cent.      In the years immediately before the war,the average rate of unemployment was 8-9 per cent.3.      The 1 944 White Paper recognised that it was not employmentalone which our national effort must seek to maintain, but &apos;ahigh level of employment combined with a rising standard of living&quot;But although full employment has been accompanied by an almostcontinuous expansion of output (interrupted only for comparatively short periods in 1947 and 1952), the possibilities of devotingthis increase in production to improving the standard of livingwere limited,  in the immediately post-war years, by the need tomeet more urgent claims on our resources.     We had to devote our efforts to making good the physical damage and destruction of thewar, to overtaking the arrears of capital investment, and, at thesame time, to restoring our balance of payments, which had been seriously dislocated by the war.      In particular, we had to achieve a very large increase in our exports, in order to offsetadverse movements in the terms of trade and the loss of a large part of our pre-war income from overseas investments.     these difficulties had been only partially overcome when,  in 1950, theoutbreak of war in Korea and the growing international tensioncompelled us to undertake a substantial programme of rearmament.As a result, it Is only in the past two years or so that theindividual consumer has become the main direct beneficiary ofthe increase in resources.4.      This pattern of development over the last ten years can be illustrated in terms of the total national output of goods and services.     Since 1946 that output has risen by 25 per cent;industrial production has risen by 50 per cent;    and the volume ofimports of goods and services has risen by about 25 per cent.But in the first four years of this period, 1946-1950, about half&apos;of the increase in available resources was exported, and afurther quarter was devoted to rebuilding and expanding fixed investment.     Most of the remainder represented an increase in personal consumption;   but this increase raised personal consumption by only some 8 per cent above the low level to whichit had inevitably been reduced by the end of the war.     In thenext two years, 1950-1952, more than two-thirds of the increasein resources had to be allocated to the new Defence programme;the level of personal consumption fell slightly.     In the lasttwo years, 1952-1954, about half of the growth of resources hasbeen absorbed by exports, investment and Government expenditure,and about half by the consumer, whose expenditure, in real terms(I.e. after allowing for price changes), has risen at the rateof 4 per cent per annum.
5.      Our experience since 1 945 is not necessarily typical ofthe working of a fully employed economy in more normal times.But it has made it sufficiently clear that, if full employment is henceforwarded to he associated with a rise in the realstandard of living of all sections of the community, v/e have twoenduring problems to face.      First, we need to maintain amuch greater degree of price stability than has been achieved inthe past decade.      Second, although we have rebuilt andsubstantially enlarged our export trade, our balance of paymentsneeds to be still further strengthened if it is not only to accommodate the removal of our remaining restrictions on importsbut also to show the substantial continuing surplus which we needo6,      To some extent, the future growth of  the economy will bedetermined by developments in other countries.      It would be unrealistic for a nation which is as dependent as ours on overseas trade to hope to maintain the full momentum of economic expansion in the   face of severe or prolonged recession in therest of the world.      But in large measure the solution of ourproblems will depend upon our own determination and our ownahility to solve them.      The effort which is implied will be considerable;    but it must be seen in the perspective of the potential expansion of the economy in the longer term, with allthat this means for the strength of our country and the welfare of our people in the future.7c      The growth of the economy is subject to the influence oftoo many unforeseeable factors, particularly the impact of technical innovation, to enable it to be predicted with any certainty.     We are on the eve of great technical advances inthe application of nuclear energy and electronics to industrialprocesses.     Under the stimulus of full employment, newattitudes to production are developing on both sides ofindustry.      The possibilities of economic progress and theimportance of raising productivity command greater understanding and a wider degree of acceptance than they did ten years ago.The influence which these factors are likely to exert on thefuture development of the economy will certainly be profound;but their full extent cannot be forecast.8.      But the fact that the pattern of economic progress cannotbexpredicted in any detail does not mean that it is whollybeyond the reach of analysis.      As new techniques of production are developed, more efficient methods of work are introduced,and the yield from investment rises, we can look forward with confidence to a continuing expansion of our capacity to produce.Thus it is possible by the use of certain specific assumptions,to project in broad outline the growth of the economy duringthe next decade;    and alternative projections are containedin Appendix I.      The assumptions involved are liable, like anyassumptions about the future, to be falsified by events inmany respects.      But although the prospect which they imply isin no sense a forecast of what1 is likely to happen,  it is of value in clarifying some of the implications of economic development.9*      One such implication is a further progressive improvementin our standard of living.     It is right that we should look forward to this possibility:    one of the main purposes ofeconomic expansion is to satisfy the natural desire of mankindto enjoy a fuller life, in terms of security and happiness,leisure,  range of choice and the fulfilment of personal hopesand ambitions.     A sustained growth of the economy is no less essential to enable us to discharge our duties as a major political and industrial power,  to sustain our commitments inmany parts of the world, and to contribute to developmentoverseas.
I &quot;72-IIc    The Problem of Price stability10o    The possibilities for the expansion of production and theimprovement of living standards which are within our reachare, therefore, very considerable0     But the full realisation of these possibilities may be jeopardised unless themaintenance of full employment and the expansion of production are accompanied by a much greater degree of price stabilitythan we have achieved in the past ten years,,11*    The White Paper of ISkk did not foresee the extent towhich full employment was to be associated with rapidly risingpriceso     Between 19^6 and 195k-) the prices of the finaloutput of goods and services of all kinds, increased by about50 per cent0*     Apart from the relatively minor effect of subsidies and indirect taxation, these prices are determinedpartly by the price of our imports and partly by our own costs of production.     And these costs of production are themselvesdetermined by the incomes of those who produce the goods and services at each stage of the productive process - in other words, by wages, salaries and profitse      The level of incomesreflects the balance of supply and demand throughout theeconomic system as a whole.      If demand is significantly inexcess of the supplies available to meet it, its pressure willitself contribute to forcing up prices    and in such conditions it becomes easier both to obtain higher money incomes and topass on any resultant increases of costs in the form of higherpriceSc      The available statistics of output and incomes donot permit us to make a comprehensive analysis of the detailedeffects of these different factorse     But a brief survey ofthe course of prices in the last ten years indicates clearly that., while increases in incomes need not necessarily lead torises in costs and prices, they do so whenever they out-run thegrowth of production, that is, whenever labour costs and/orprofit margins rise per unit of output012o    The history of rising prices since the war fallsbroadly into four phases:-(i)    The immediate legacy of the war was a world-wideshortage of goods,  coupled with an excess of demandfor theme     World prices therefore rose sharply, and&apos; from 194-6-19^48 the average prices of our importsincreased by 25 per cent*     This increase would, ifit. had been the only factor at work, have raised theaverage level of our final prices by about 5 per cent.But it was accompanied by a widespread demand for higher incomes in this country;,    and, because this increase in incomes outstripped the growth of output,costs of production rose,s the rise being reflected in an increase not of 5 per cent but of 15 per centin the average level of pricesaA definition of this price index, and of the factors whichhave influenced it. is contained in. Appendix II.
(ii)    In 19k8, the White Paper on Personal Incomes, costs and Prices (Cmd.7321) set out the dangers of furtherprice rises.     In the next two years incomes didnot increase much faster than output, and costs ofproduction were therefore considerably more stable.Since, at the same time, world supplies were becoming more plentiful, import prices also were rising lessfast.     As a result, our own final prices roserelatively little,(iii)    In 1950, the Korean war precipitated a fresh outburst of world demand, particularly for primary products;and import prices rose sharply.     This resulted ina rise in retail prices in this country, which itselfinitiated a demand for a compensating adjustment in incomes.     These increased incomes added substan-tially to costs, because at that time it wasproving difficult to increase output:    shortage ofsteel retarded production in 1951? and the world-widerecession in the demand for textiles, clothing andother consumer goods - itself a reaction from the korean boom - led to an actual fall in output in1952.      In the event, our final prices rose18 per cent between 1950 and 1952,The reduction in the food subsidies in 1952 addedsomewhat to prices in the latter part of that yearand in the early months of 1953*     But after 1952the growth of production was resumed, and during thewhole of that year and the first part of 1954 import prices were falling.     At home, however, incomeswere rising rather faster than output.     The fallin import prices was sufficiently large to offset the rise in home costs, and during most of 1953 andthe first half of 195k prices were very stable.But after the middle of 195k import prices began torise again, while the upward trend of home costsshowed some acceleration.     The combined result hasshown itself in the renewed upward pressure on costs and prices which has continued into 1955*13*    This brief summary of the course of our final prices inthe past.ten years has inevitably compressed into a fewparagraphs a highly complex process.     But its essential features are clear:-(a)    Since 19k6 the prices of the final output of goods and services of all kinds have risen by about 50 per cent.Of this increase, about one-tenth is attributable to thenet effect of changes in subsidies and indirect taxes.The remaining nine-tenths have been determined bymovements in import prices and in our own costs ofproduction.(iv)\-k-
\ lb(b) Since 1946 the prices of our imports of goods and services have risen &quot;by about 75 per cent, partly as ax*result of the devaluation of sterling in 1949.     Inthe same period money incomes per unit of output haveincreased by about 50 per cent.     But for the economy as a whole our own costs of production, as measured by money incomes per unit of output, are between three and four times as important as import prices, in termsof their effect on final prices.      Thus, although therise in import prices has been greater than the risein our own costs of production, it is the latter whichhave been - and will remain - responsible for by far the greater part of the increase in our final prices.(c) Although, over the ten years as a whole, import prices have risen by 75 per cent, they have fluctuatedconsiderably during this period, sometimes rising and sometimes falling,,     When they have risen they have notonly added directly to our price level, but alsoinitiated demands for higher incomes, the result ofwhich has been greatly to magnify the immediate impact on the price level of the rise in import pricesthemselves.      It is this process which has established,from time to time, a new, and permanently higher, levelof prices.     That level has never fallen when import prices fell, because the gain from lower import prices has been more than offset by the rising trend of incomes and costs at home.\
1III.    Changes in the Distribution of Income14.    Of the factors which determine our final prices, the mostimportant is, therefore, our own costs of production i.e. ourown incomes and productivity.     We cannot analyse the extent towhich changes in different categories of income have contributed to the increases in costs of production, and so to the rise inprices discussed above.      But the relative movements of these categories of income over a period of years are of obviousrelevance and public interest.     They emerge clearly from thefollowing tattle:-Table 2Incomes from Employment and Gross Trading Profits1958. 1948. 1954&amp; millionWages and Salaries193819481954Gross Trading profits of Companies andPublic Enterprises193819481954Incomes from Self-Employment19381948\ 19542,8306,1409,265PercentageChanges100217327Share in TotalNationalIncome5559597642,0182,9956471,3281,645100264392100205254151919131311Note;    The items in this table are taken from the BlueBook on National Income and Expenditure, 1955,Tables 1 and 2.15.    This table shows that nearly 80 per cent of incomes consists of wages and salaries and the gross trading profits of companies and public enterprises;    that the total of wages and salariesis rather more than three times as great as the total of grosstrading profits;    that the latter showed a rather greaterproportionate rise than the former between 1938 and 1948j   andthat&apos; both types of income have risen at a more or less equalrate - by about 50 per cent - in the period between 1948 and1954.16,   The distribution of gross profits as between dividends,taxes and reserves is a separate question.       The followingtable provides estimates of the allocation of the total income of companies, in 1938, in 1948 and in 1954.

In both 19k8 and 195k, dividendstook a little over 20 per cent of total company incomes;    taxesaccounted for about 30 per cent;   nearly kO per cent was put to reserve;. and the balance of some 10 per cent was absorbed bythe other items.18, * Dividends constitute about 5 per cent of the total of incomes analysed in Table 2, and their relevance to themovement of prices lies much less in their direct effect onthe level of incomes than in the pressure which they areliable to generate for what are felt to be correspondingadjustments of wages and salaries.

TV.   Price Stability andEconomic Progress21 .   Earlier sections of this paper have referred to some ofthe possibilities for future economic expansion, and have discussed the forces which have made for rising prices since1945o   Unless the upward pressure of rising money incomes on prices is moderated, continued economic expansion is likelyto be associated with serious and increasing strains, botheconomic and social.    These strains, if not relieved, maywell prevent our realising our full potentialities of economic growth; and they may, especially if they cause balance ofpayments difficulties, lead to a set-back in the rate of our economic progress.22.   The increase in our overseas earnings which-will berequired if we are to pay for the imports needed to sustainan expanding economy and to maintain an adequate surplus onour balance of payments, will depend, for its realisation, on two factors - first, a continuing growth of production andtrade throughout the world; second, our own ability to secure a sufficient share of this growing trade.    The policies ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government are directed, in co-operation withthose of many other countries, to securing the maximumexpansion of trade and to creating conditions in which this trade can flow freely.   But no efforts of Government alone canensure that this country reaps,the fullest advantage from theexpansion of world trade.    Our success in export marketsdepends on the vigour of our production, on the versatility and initiative of British industry, and - in the long run mostimportant of all - on our competitive strength in world markets.23.    Competition in overseas markets is now very keen; and thiscountry no longer enjoys the pre-eminent position which it heldduring the last century.    Today we have to match ourselvesagainst formidable rivals.   The dislocation caused by the warleft the United States of America the only source of supply formany goods: and the United States&apos; share of world trade inmanufactures has risen from about 20 per cent in 1937 to more than 25 per cent today.   As against Western Germany weenjoyed a considerable advantage in the years immediately afterthe war; even as late as 1950, her share of world exports was little more than 7 per cent.   Today it is more than doublethat figure.   In the same five years the total volume of world trade in manufactures has risen by about  $0 per cent/; but our own share has fallen from over 25 per cent to about20 per cent.2k.   A country?s share of world trade is affected by manyfactors apart from its competitive power, and too much weight should not be attached to the precise percentage at any singlepoint in time.   But a continuing downward trend in the share,if it persists too long, must inevitably be a cause of concern;for if such a decline reflects the fact that exports are notIncreasing sufficiently to meet a growing Import bill and to finance other external commitments, serious balance ofpayments difficulties will Inevitably result.   these difficulties cannot be allowed to remain uncorrected.
25*   An adequate volume of exports, in so far as it lies inour power to maintain it, will depend above all upon the competitive strength of our goods in overseas markets.   Thatstrength is itself the outcome of several factors - thequality of the product, promptness of delivery, effectivesalesmanship, good after-sales service, and so forth.   Butthe basic factor is price.    If our prices and our costs ofproduction move too far out of line with those of our competitors, our exports will be inadequate to the needs ofour balance of payments, and our currency will not retian its value in world markets.26.   These balance of payments difficulties are the mostobvious and immediate consequence of a disproportionate riseIn costs and prices.   But such an increase, if it persists,has other, and no less serious, effects at home.   The future growth of the economy will to a considerable extent depend upon a sustained expansion of investment; and the rate of investment which we can afford will depend on our willingness to save.   In the long run, therefore, the rate of our economic progress will depend largely on this willingness to save andto invest.   The full effect of continually rising prices onsavings is unpredictable; but it is clear that they canprogressively undermine the whole relationship betweenborrower and lender, and, therefore, the accepted structure of savings.   That structure rests, to a considerable extent,on the willingness of the lender to hold, for long periods,titles to fixed sums - in the form of Savings Certificates,Government Secruities, Insurance policies, Debenture stock,and so forth.   This willingness itself derives from a basicconfidence that money will, broadly, retain its value.   In sofar as rising prices impair this confidence, and, therefore,reduce the lender&apos;s willingness to invest savings at fixedrates of interest, the financing of investment becomes moredifficult and more expensive; and the pressure on prices isaccentuated.27*   But the effects of a rising price level have a much more direct and more immediately personal Impact.   Continuallyrising prices are an obvious social evil.   For many peoplethis evil Is obscured by the fact that they either are, orbelieve themselves to be, able to secure increases in theirincomes to offset the rise in prices; and although their pressure for higher incomes itself adds to the pressure on prices and they do not in fact gain very much from the risein incomes, at least they do not lose very much from the risein prices.   Even so, the spiral of rising incomes and price is a cause of considerable personal anxiety and of an acutesense of social unfairness.   The difficulties and hardshipsinherent in such a situation bear most heavily on thosedependent on fixed incomes, who are in continual danger of having their standard of living progressively reduced.   the longer this process continues, the more arbitrary its effectsappear, and the more sharply the sense of injustice is felt.-1 0-
V.    The Conditions of Price Stability28.     Pull employment and a climate of economic expansiondepends upon the maintenance of a high and steadily rising levelof demand.     It is in such circumstances that the pressure of incomes on costs and prices is likely to grow most rapidly and to meet with least resistance,,     Price stability, in sofar as it is determined by factors under our own control, is,therefore, largely a function of productivity and self-discipline;    and full employment will only be accompanied byprice stability if both sides of industry play their part,29.   An increase in productivity calls for contributions from both management and labour.     Management must strive to ensurethe maximum expansion of output by progressive investment inthe most efficient capital assets, by the introduction of themost modern industrial techniques and by the elimination ofall restrictive practices which inhibit the economic growth of production.      The. contribution of labour lies in co-operating to the full in the adoption of new methods ofworking and in setting   aside all practices which, howeverjustifiable they may have been in the past as means of safe-guarding status, conditions of work, or the security of employ-ment itself, are not appropriate in conditions of full employment,30.    The healthy functioning of the economy and the progressivegrowth of its output depend also on co-operation between bothsides of industry in maintaining an efficient and enlightenedsystem of industrial relations.     The relation between management and workers which this implies is a vital butintangible factor which only they can create by common effort,it demands a full and frank exchange of opinion&apos; and  information at all levels between representatives who have confidence ineach other&apos;s competence and integrity.     If this confidenceis achieved and maintained, the gain, in terms both of physicaloutput and of human relations, can be incalculably great.      Ifnot, the resulting discontent and friction are liable to dis-credit British industry, abroad no less than at home, ,and will,therefore, impede production, hamper exports, and detract from our longer term success.3&quot;1 c   Efficient methods of work and sound industrial relations should result in a sustained growth of productivity, yieldingeconomic production and competitive prices.      The movement ofthe prices of individual goods and services is bound todiverge, since the rate at which productivity rises willdiffer from industry to industry and from firm to firm.     Inthose sectors of the economy in which it is not easy to achievevery rapid increases in productivity, prices will tend to rise.If general price stability is to be maintained, it is essentialthat this tendency should be offset by a positive reduction ofprices in those sectors of the economy in which productivityrises more rapidly than the average. ,32.    The objective of price stability and the progressive price policy which it implies will largely depend, for their fulfil-ment, on the extent to which prices remain subject to the pressure of incomes^,     Rising&apos; profits are an economic consequenceof the rising level of activity which is the necessary basis of full employment.     And inasmuch as&quot; profits are the source of .finance for much of our new investment, they contribute substantially to the expansion of activity in the future.
But a fully employed economy requires a price policy whichpasses on the gains from higher productivity, as far aspossible, in lower prices.     In other words, industry should endeavour to earn its profits not by the maintenance of highprofit margins but by the expansion of turnover.      Those enter-prises which can achieve an increase of output and sales by areduction of profit margins will, in this way, be making a positive contribution to the maintenance of price stability andto the whole process of balanced economic growth.33.    The counterpart of realism in profits is realism in costs.The costs of production are not wholly under the control ofBritish industry itself;    in particular, the prices of importsmust always remain uncertain.     But to a very considerable degreeour costs are determined by the incomes of those engaged in all forms of production of goods and services.     The Government ofthis country does not attempt to tell the people what income eachone of them ought to be receiving at any given moment.     Wages are fixed by free negotiation between employers and workpeople, withina system of collective bargaining which we have built up over along period of years.     By equally long practice, the level of dividend declared by a company is a matter for recommendation bythe Directors and confirmation by the shareholders.     But the satisfactory operation of this whole system depends upon the ex-tent to which the parties concerned in each case show themselvesaware of the fundamental factors involved in the progressive development of the economy of which they are all members.     Ifthe resulting decisions reflect too greatly the pressure of merelysectional interests, economic stability will be endangered and thepossibilities of future expansion will be impaired.34.    These two objectives, the stability and the expansion of our economy, are the continuing concern of Government policy.     TheGovernment is pledged to foster conditions in which the nationcan, if it so wills, realise its full potentialities for growth interms of employment and living standards.     But the government must no   less seek to ensure that the pressure of domestic demanddoes not reach a level at which it threatens price stability and endangers the balance of payments.     To maintain the duebalance between these objectives of policy is always a difficult and delicate task;    and the fiscal, monetary and social policies of the Government action must be adjusted, from time to time, tomeet changes in economic pressures.     But the ultimate aim willalv/ays remain essentially the same - the encouragement, by allthe means which the Government commands, of the general climatemost favourable to the maximum development of a balanced economy.35,   Economic growth depends, to a considerable extent, onthe rate at which increased invesment contributes to theexpansion of productive capacity.     In the private sector theappropriate level of investment can be encouraged by specificfiscal incentives, by the appropriate use of monetary and creditpolicy, and by other general measures of Government policydesigned to maintain expansion and to promote saving.     In thepublic sector the Government has a more direct responsibility,and a more immediate opportunity, for influencing the rate and pattern of investment.     It must therefore keep under review the investment for. which it is responsible, and moderate or ac-celerate its rate- of-growth from time to time, in order that itsclaim on available resources in the shorter term should be
proportionate to the needs of the economy as a whole.   Butthe scale and direction of the investment plans of thepublic sector must be designed to ensure that the expansionof basic supplies and services will he adequate to sustain,in the long term, the full growth of the economy,,36.    It is not only through public investment that theGovernment contributes significantly to the total level of demand.    The extent to which it can affect that level, in either direction, depends not merely upon its fiscal and monetary policies but also upon its own direct expenditureon goods and services.    The magnitude of this expenditure isto some extent determined by conditions over which theGovernment has no   control:    to some extent it is determinedby the Government&apos;s own policies, which will need to adjustGovernmental outlay according to the prevailing economicconditions.37*    Finally, the Government of a democratic country has a clear duty to keep the nation informed of changes in the pattern of expansion, and to warn it of the dangers of bothstagnation and unbalanced growth.    The future prosperity ofour country will be, to a considerable extent, a matter ofour own choice and our own actions.    These should bedetermined by an awareness of the economic factors which,however much we may usually take them for granted, are, ina substantial degree, under our own control.    Not the leastvaluable of the contributions which the Government can make to the progressive and healthy growth of the economy is toenable the men and women of this country to appreciate more fully the way in which individual decisions and efforts caninfluence our standard of living, and may, in the longer term, profoundly affect our whole future.    It is the purposeof this White Paper to explain the dangers to which a fully employed economy is exposed in so far as full employment is reflected in a continually rising level of costs and prices.These dangers can be averted, and our national prosperitycan be more securely established, by a clear realisation ofwhat    is at stake and a determined will to shape our actionsaccordingly.-1 3-
THE PROBLEMS AND POTENTIALITIES OP ECONOMIC EXPANSION1.     Pull employment favours economic progress, and thereforeaffords growing scope for improving our standard of living.    Ourpresent problems, and the day-to-day decisions and actionswhich they require, need to be judged in the light of thepossibilities for expansion and the difficulties which must be overcome if the full potentialities for future growth are to berealised.2.      It is impossible to forecast the rate at which we shallsucceed in expanding our production in the future.    It isequally impossible to predict in detail the lines on whicheconomic expansion will develop.    We shall inevitably have newproblems to face; and new and unforeseeable claims on our resources will have to be met.    Nevertheless this does not imply that all the problems of economic growth are incapable ofanalysis, or that the potentialities for expansion cannot be envisaged to some extend.3.     We know the rate of expansion which has been achieved inthe past.    It is possible to examine the implications of such an expansion in production and productive capacity in the future.The growth of production and incomes v/ill require a growth ofimports to sustain it; and the rising import bill will need tobe matched by a corresponding expansion in exports.    Again, thegrowth of production will require an increase in our productivecapacity, and this will in turn require a corresponding increase in the level of investment.    Thus it is possible toexamine the increases in exports and investment required to sustain an increase in production, and to indicate very broadlywhat such an expansion in production, investment and exportsmight provide in terms of higher standards of living.    It ispossible also, by using the same method but adopting adifferent set of assumptions, to discuss the implications of achieving a more rapid expansion than has proved possiblehitherto, and therefore to assess the further gains which ahigher rate of expansion might yield, if it could be securelyestablished.    It is these possibilities which are examined inthis Appendix.The expansion of output4.      Past experience offers some guide to the rate of progress which may reasonably be assumed.    Between 1948 and 1954, output-per-man in the industries covered by the Index of industrial production rose, on&apos;average, by about 3 per cent a year.    in four of these years, increases of between 4 and 5 per cent wererealised; but the gains in these years were offset by much smaller increases In 1951 and 1952 when conversion to rearmament,the steel shortage, and the brief recession interrupted progress.One possible assumption, therefore, might be that over the next ten years output-per-man will increase at the same average rate as has been achieved since 1948.    There is nothing impossible in this hypothesis; indeed it would be pessimistic to assume that we can do no better than we have done hitherto.    If thenext decade comprised roughly the same proportion of favourableand less favourable years, but reflected no fundamental change
in the trend of progress,  output-per-man in industry might he expected to continue to rise at an average rate of about 3 percent per annum.    If, on the other hand, technical progress v/eremore rapid, if the response of industry to the possibilities of expansion yielded greater returns in increasing productivity,or if we could assume fewer interruptions of the trend of expansion, output-per-man might rise,  over the whole period, atleast&apos;as fast as it has done in the more favourable post-war years, i.e. by between 4 and 5 per cent per annum.5a      On the lower of these assumptions, that is if output-per-man in industry were to increase at a rate of about 3 per cent per annum (allowance being made also for the small increase which can be foreseen in the population&apos;of working age),industrial production might be, by 1964, nearly 50 per cent above its present level.    On the higher assumption, that is thatwe do as well as we have done in the more favourable post-war years, the increase in industrial production achieved by 1964might be of the order of 70 per cent,    After allowing for a continuing, but smaller, increase in output-per-man in the restof the economy, the national income (at 1954 prices) might be,on the lower assumption, about  4750 million higher in 1 964than it is now - an increase of about a third; while on thehigher assumption it might rise by about  7,000 million - anincrease of some 45 per cent.The balance of payments6.     The growth of production, and the corresponding growth of incomes, will be associated with a rising demand for importsof raw materials, of food, and of manufactured goods0    this increase in the demand for imports cannot be calculated at allexactly:    it will depend upon, among other things, the extentto which we prove able to supply our own needs efficiently, by comparison with overseas sources of supply, and upon the extentto which the industries which contribute most to the expansionof output remain dependent upon imported materials.    But,allowing for possible changes in the pattern of demand and production, it may perhaps be assumed that our demand for imports might increase, in real terms, at about the same rateasxthe national income as a whole.    This would imply an increaseof nearly 3 per cent per annum in the volume of imports on thelower assumption, and about 3*5 per cent on the higher assump-tion - increases of nearly 35 per cent and about 45 per cent respectively over the next ten years.7c     These imports will have to be paid for; and if periouicstrain on the balance of payments is not to threaten the stability of the economy and to interrupt Its growth, we shall need to increase our overseas earnings sufficiently to offset the rise in imports.8c &apos;   The magnitude of this increase will depend not merely onthe volume of our imports but also on their price.    The pricesof the goods which we buy from overseas, particularly primary products, are determined by supply and demand in world markets.In the long term the movement of the prices of primary products will depend on the rate at which world production ofthose products can be increased relatively to the demand forthem; and this will be a major factor in determining the seculartrend in our terms of trade.    But apart from any secular trend,the prices of our imports will always be liable to short termfluctuations.    If,  either by reason of such fluctuations or
19^&quot;because of an adverse long term trend, our terms of tradedeteriorate, we need to match this deterioration by acorresponding increase in our external earnings.    An increasein our import prices implies an increase in the incomes of our overseas suppliers, and a worsening of our terms of trade offersus, in general, more favourable opportunities for expandingour export sales, and thus for restoring the balance on our external account.    We should, therefore, be able to meet adversefluctuations in the terms of trade, provided that our economy is sufficiently flexible to permit us to enlarge our exportsquickly, and that these exports are sufficiently competitive,in price, quality and delivery, to take full advantage of the opportunities.    But, in order to withstand the initial impact of fluctuations in world prices we shall always need adequate reserves and a sufficient surplus on our balance of payments.9*     But the balance of payments has to accommodate not merely the results of changes in our current trade but also aconsiderable body of international commitments - the repayment of our debts, the maintenance of armed forces in many parts ofthe world, and the financing of development in the Commonwealth,the Colonies, and many,other countries.    To meet these commitments we need to earn and to maintain,  over a period ofyears, an adequate surplus on our current transactions.10.    It would be quite unrealistic to attempt to predict our terms of trade over the next ten years.    But on the assumptionthat they show no secular trend in either direction and thattemporary fluctuations can be absorbed by the economy without undue strain, the growth of imports envisaged above, combined with the discharge of our continuing international commitments,and the maintenance of a healthy surplus on our balance ofpayments and an adequate level of reserves, would imply anincrease in our overseas earnings of the order of K5 per cent onthe lower assumption and 60 per cent on the higher.Investment11y   The maintenance of full employment and a steady growth of output will require - and can also be expected to induce r an expansion of productive capacity and an increase in the nation&apos;sstock of capital assets.    Indeed, the scale of our investment,both now and in the future, will to a considerable extentdetermine the rate at, which it proves possible to increase production.    If investment plans are based on too cautious an assessment of the longer term prospect for demand and output,the full potentialities of economic expansion will not berealised.    The counterpart of a high rate.of investment is ahigh rate of saving by the community as a whole.    The greater the willingness to save, the greater will be the resourcesliberated for increasing investment and,  consequently, thegreater will be the possibilities for the-growth of output inthe long term.
12.    Investment in productive industry and the provision of basic services may be distinguished from investment in housing and the social services.   Both contribute to the welfare ofthe nation as a whole; but the former is more directly related to the growth of output than the latter.    It is not possibleto estimate the probable expansion of either type of invest-ment with any precision, particularly in view of the unpredic-table impact of technical progress.    But the increase in investment in productive industry and basic services whichwould be required to sustain the growth of output assumedabovo might be, over the next ten years, of the order of 1,200 million on the lower assumption, and  2,000 million on the higher.    In the climate of an expanding economy, itis not unrealistic to expect the growth of output and incomesenvisaged above to yield a growth of savings sufficient to finance an expansion of investment of this magnitude.The, current expenditure of Public Authorities on goods ands or vices13.    The expenditure of the Central Government and LocalAuthorities has become, and will remain, an important element in the total level of demand.    Much of it is associatedwith tho maintenance of the basic structure and security ofthe State - the armed forces, the judicial system, the Police,the roads, coast protection and so forth.    By far thelargest of these is Defence.    The level of Defence expenditurein ten years&apos; time will, of course, depend mainly on international developments which are wholly unforeseeable.For the purpose of these projections, therefore, it hasbeen assumed that Defence expenditure, with tho other items in this group, ?;ill remain broadly at the present level.But -if, as is greatly to be hoped, an improvement of inter-national relations makes possible some reduction in the outlayon &quot;the armed forces, the resources so released should enable us to aim at even larger and more rapid increases in invest-ment and living standards than can be envisaged at present.Consumer/s. standard of living1k.
