tTOP SECRET Copy No... .4.7.C.P.(55) 12519th September, 1955CABINETNATIONAL service/Memorandum by the Minister of defence i circulate for the consideration of my colleagues my recommenda-tions on National Service.    The attached memorandum is the same as thatcirculated to the Defence Committee as D. C. (55) 34 (which was considered at their meeting on 15th September) save only that paragraph 16 has been-drafted and there are minor drafting changes in paragraph 22.background the purposes of National Service were announced by the thenPrime Minister in 1946 as:-(a) To build up a large trained reserve which would beready for operational use in an emergency withoutthe need for a lengthy period of further training.(b) To supplement the regular component of the activeforces to enable them to carry out their world-wide commitments.2.       At that time the primary purpose of the scheme was recognised to be the training of the reserves.    The period was originally announced at 18 months when the National Service Bill was introduced on12th March, 1947.    The period was changed to 12 months within 24 hoursof the Second Reading on 31st March/lst April, 1947.    It was raised to ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.19th September, 1955.NATIONAL. service the circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................
&quot;2J^18 months before the National Service Act came into force on 1st January, 194In October, 1950, after the Korean war had broken out, it was raised to twoyears.3.        More recently the emphasis has changed.    As the consequences of nuclear war have been realised, it has been recognised that the primary purpose of National Service is to maintain the active forces at the strengthnecessary to enable them to meet the country&apos;s commitments rather than to build up reserves,A situation has also grown up in which, without National Service,the necessary numbers of junior leaders and technicians cannot beprovided,4,        The present power to call men up under the National Service Actsexpires on 31st December, 1950,5,        The demand of the forces on United Kingdom manpower in recentyears has been as followsDateMenWomenTotalAt 31. 3. 53At 31. 3. 54At 31. 3. 55At 30. 6. 55846,682(National Service312,781)022,753(National Service298,377)803,073(National Service284,954)783,533(National Service279,564)24,41523,16620,55719,39371,097045,919023,630002,926In this year&apos;s Defence White Paper it was stated that - by 31st March, 1956the total figure would have fallen to 788,000, of whom 285,500 would benational-service men.    On present forecasts, this figure will be about783,000, of whom 237,000 will be national-service men.    Owing to thereduction in the number of regulars, the present forecast is that the total,by 31st March, 1958, will be 765,000, of whom about 300,000 will benational-service men.     It will be seen that between 31st March, 1955, and31st March, 1958, the reduction in the total numbers serving will, on present plans, be due solely to the expected diminution in regulars,6.       At the present time almost half the total strength of the Army isnational-service men.    About a quarter of the Corporals, half the Lance-Corporals and more than half of the tradesmen in the Army are national-service men.    In some highly skilled trades the proportion of nationalservice-men is more than 70 per cent.    The Royal Air Force are alsolargely dependent upon national-service men in some of the highly skilled trades, e, g, for 25 per cent of their radio fitters.    Sven thoughthe number of national-service men in the Royal Navy is small, about10 per cent of the main branches (seamen and engineer-mechanics) serving in ships in commission come from this source.
7.        Together with the Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply,I have been examining the long-term trends in the demands of the defence programme upon the physical and material resources of the nation.    Asa result I have suggested to my colleagues a reduction in the strength ofthe forces to 700,000 (680,000 men and 20,000 women approximately) bythe 31st March, 1950,    This is a reduction of about 100,000 on the present figure, a reduction of 83,000 in the two years beginning 1st April, 1956,and a reduction of 65,000 on the present plans for the figure at the31st March, 1958,    The consequences of this reduction to the front line strength of the Services are being examined.    They are bound to be serious, but in my view must be accepted,    I do not, however, think thata larger reduction is possible.If this figure is accepted, the demand of the active forces on united Kingdom manpower will be reduced by 170,000 between March, 1953and March, 1958,So far as national-service men are concerned, it means areduction from about 280,000 at present to about 235,000 provided the adverse trends in regular recruiting and re-engagements to not increase,POSSIBLE METHODS OF PROCURING THE ABOVE REDUCTION8.        There are a number of methods by which the proposed reduction could be achieved:-(a) Retain national service at 24 months but reduce the intake by a selective system on the United Statespattern,(b) Retain national service at 24 months but reduce the intake by a system of ballot,(c) Retain national service at 24 months but reducethe intake by increasing the number of indefinitedeferments (i, e. a system of &quot;selectiveexemptions&quot;),(d) Reduce the period of national service to 10 months,(e) Retain national service at 24 months but reduce the intake by allowing the age of call-up to rise,(f) A combination of one or more of the above or variantsof them,9,        For reasons which I shall set out, I advise that (a),(b) and(d) should be rejected,I am not in favour of (c) as a means of effecting the full number required, although it might be worthy of consideration as a means of effecting a subsidiary saving.Therefore I believe that the real choice is either (e) or somecombination under (f).
In the United States the Selective Service System is controlled by theFederal Office of Selective Service and is administered through some4,000 local Draft Boards, each of which is given a monthly quota of mento be called up.    Such a system allows for a great deal of flexibility both as to numbers and methods of selection.    It may well be the most suitablesystem for a Federal and heterogenous country like the United States.    Ido not believe that such a system would be acceptable in this country.11.  Course (b).   (Retaining National Service at 24 months butreducing the intake by a system of ballot.)This has the merit of being simple and impartial.    It would preserve the appearance of universal liability for service, although individualindefinite deferments along the present lines would still be necessary.But its incidence as between individuals would be the more marked, sincesomething like four -fifths of those involved in the ballot would have to becalled up and only one-fifth would escape.    In my view the use of the ballot to decide a comparatively small difference in treatment might be acceptable (i, e. a ballot to decide 21 months or 24 months), but its use todecide between such extremes as two years and no service at all wouldnot be acceptable to public opinion.12.  Course (c).   (Retaining National Service at 24 months but reducingthe intake by increasing the number of indefinite deferments.)The present indefinite deferments scheme covers coalmining, theMerchant Navy, fishermen who are members of the Royal Naval Reserve(Patrol Service), agriculture (in part), very limited numbers of PoliceCadets and men specially qualified scientifically and technically, suchas graduates for the Government Scientific Service, highly qualifiedtechnicians in certain industries of importance to defence work, etc.An extension of the present scheme to include all agriculturalists(8,000 a year) and those national service men in medical category Grade III(6,000 a year) would not be difficult and would reduce the numbers entering the forces by about 14,000 a year.    The case for extending it toagriculturalists would be that it is most difficult to get them to return to agriculture after their period of national-service.    The case for extendingit to national-service men in Grade III would be that these, on the whole,are more trouble and expense to the forces than they are worth.It would be possible to extend the scope of deferment amongindustries of importance to defence work or experts.    There have alreadybeen many claims on behalf of particular interests.    Substantial reductions could only be effected in this way by &quot;blanket extensions&quot; of deferment tocover whole industries or professions or vocations.    It would be extremely difficult to differentiate within particular industries, etc.    any large scale extension on these lines would, I am told, create serious difficulties with the Ministry of Labour and National Service, who would beresponsible for administering and policing the scheme.This method would probably also lose to the Services many of theofficers, technicians and craftsmen whom they at present obtain alreadypartly technically trained.    If this scheme were to be taken beyond thereducing the intal;e by a selective system on the United Statespattern. )
agriculturalists and medical category III men, the more it is examined thegreater appear the practical difficulties.    It would, of course, be a furtherbreach of the principle of universality on which national service in theoryat present rests.13.  Course (d).   (A reduction in the period of National Service to13 months. )This method, if applied as from 1st January, 1956, would by 1st July, 1957, reduce the number of national-service men in the armed forces by some 70,000,    It would also have a serious effect on the numberof men serving on regular engagements of three years or more.    It isestimated that by March, 1959, that would amount to a further loss of30,000 men in the strength of the forces beyond the expected diminution inthis category of men already foreseen.    At present, with two years nationalservice and the liability for part-time service, between 25 per cent and30 per cent of the men liable to be called up for national service in theArmy and the Royal Air Force volunteer for regular engagements of threeyears or more.    It is expected that if the period were cut to IS months thenumber of volunteers for these regular engagements would be reduced bya half in the case of the Royal Air Force and about one-third in the caseof the Army.    It is doubtful whether foreseeable improvements in pay andconditions of service would substantially affect these figures.It will be seen from what I have just stated that this method would produce a reduction in manpower carrying the total well below the 700,000,which I believe to be the greatest reduction reasonably attainable by31st March, 1950.My colleagues are already well aware of the effect which a cut of six months would have upon the efficiency of the forces.    For example,with 24 months1 national service, a battalion on a normal three-yearsoverseas tour changes 55 per cent of its national service content twiceand the remaining 45 per cent once during the tour.    The average nationalservice content of a battalion is about 60 per cent.    Standards would fall to quite an unacceptable extent and front line strengths would have to be substantially cut.    It would be impossible to carry out our present commitments.    The period of useful service in those trades which need the longest training would be reduce   to six months or less.    Numerically,the effect on the Royal Air Force would not be so severe, but it would be worse hit in its most sensitive points, since it would lose half of theuseful service of national-service men in some of the most highly skilledtrades where the shortage of regulars is most acute and where thenumber of regulars due to leave is heavy.    It would also lose a numberof N, C, Os. , of whom it is already short.    In some highly skilled trades in all the Services it would no longer be worth while training nationalservice men at all.Training overheads are already high.    In the Army some 20 per cent and in the Royal Air Force some 30 per cent of the total strengths arealready either training or being trained.    With a quicker turnover ofnational service men the training overheads would have to be proportionatelyincreased.Another consequence would be the bad effect on the morale of theregulars.    At present the strain of producing operationally efficientunits is already heavy.    With a quicker turnover of national servicemen the strain would be increased and the incentive to regulars toleave the Services would grow.
14.  Course (e).   (Retain National Service at 24 months but reduce the intake by allowing the age of call-up to rise. )By adhering to the present plan of only three registrations this yearand dropping one registration in 1956 and one in 1957, it would be possibleto reduce the number of national-service men to the figure of 235,000 by march, 1953.    This would raise the age of call-up from 10 years 5 monthsat present to about 19 years by March, 1958.    If this expedient were continued beyond 1950, it would mean that the age of call-up would increase by about three months each year.There are many advantages in adopting this method during the period up to March, 1953;-(a) The Services would retain the benefit of the efficiency andflexibility that result from 24 months1 national service.In fact, with the rising age of call-up this flexibilitywould be increased.(b) The method itself is extremely flexible.    If the inter-national situation were to change for the worse therewould be no difficulty in increasing quickly the numberscalled up.    If the international situation were to changefor the better and our overseas commitments weresabstantially reduced, other methods such as a reductionin the period of service could be comparatively quicldyintroduced in combination with, or substitution for,this method.Even though coupled with a reduction in the requirements for part-time service   (which I deal with below), this method would be least damaging to regular recruitment and re-engagement.I believe that the rise in the age of call-up would be welcomed by many parents who feel that their sons atpresent go into the Services too young. .  I am told that industrially there would be no disadvantages.So far as those who leave school at 10 are concerned,it would still be open to them to apply for early call-up.15.   Course (f).   (A combination of one or more of the above methodsor variants of them. )I think there are only three combinations worth considering.-(i) Reduce the period of national service to 21 months and allow the age of call-up to rise.(ii) Reduce the period to 21 months and give indefinitedeferments to agriculturalists and medicalcategory III.(c)(d)V(iii) Allow the age to rise and give indefinite defer-ments to agriculturalists and those in medicalcategory III.
Of these I should be inclined to reject (ii) on the ground that if the call-upis to be reduced to 21 months course (i) is much simpler.    I should reject(iii) on the ground that if the call-up is not to be reduced course (e) setout above is much simpler.    In neither case would it appear to me to be worth while to open the door to the whole argument about more deferments.With regard to (i), a cut of three months in the period of full-time service beginning on 1st January, 1956, would reduce the number of national-service men by about 35,000 by 1st October, 1957.    At the end of threeyears, in addition to the run-down at present foreseen, there wouldprobably be a further loss to the Services of 15,000  owing to a declinein the number of men serving on short-term regular engagements.    Onlyminor alterations in registration and call-up would be necessary to bringclown the figure to 700,000.    The effect would be that the age of call-upwould rise to about 10 years 7 months by March, 1958.A three months1 cut would have to a lesser extent the consequencesset out in paragraph 13 above with regard to a six months1 cut.    Theireffects, however, would be less than half as severe because the services would get three more months of useful service when the man was effectivelypulling his weight.    However, in both the Army and the Royal Air force the period of trained service would be so shortened in many trades thatit would not be worth while sending such men to the more distant stations.As men could not spend so long overseas there would be an increase ofwasted time in movement, etc.    More regulars would have to be posted to distant theatres and the ratio of home to overseas service worsened,with bad effects on recruiting and re-engagement.A cut of three months would have serious effects upon the efficiency of the forces.CONCLUSION16. The choice between 24 months and 21 months is not easy.\n It would be possible to reduce the period to 21 months, provided itis realised that the effect upon efficiency would be considerable, and thatit would have an adverse effect upon recruiting.    It may be the leastreduction that will retain general support for national service.    The dangerabout course (e) is that it might be thought to be a &quot;wangle&quot;.    It might be misinterpreted and misrepresented as an attempt to conceal the fact thatwe were really intending to keep precisely the same number of people in the Services.On the other hand I doubt whether a reduction of three months would satisfy those who have been clamouring for either six or twelve months1reduction.    We should be expected to follow it up very shortly with areduction of at least a further three months.    That expectation would add to uncertainty and have a further bad effect upon regular recruiting.    Ifwe reduce by three months now, our freedom of manoeuvre in 1958, whennew powers of call-up must be sought, will be proportionately diminished.The reduction in part-time service proposed in the next paragraph might increase willingness to continue to accept 24 months.I think that the political assessment is difficult but on balance Ifavour retaining the period at 24 months.
FART-TIME SERVICE17. When the National Service Act was passed in 1947, the periodof part-time service was fixed at six years.    It was reduced to four yearswhen the period of whole-time service was increased from 1Z to 18 months in 1949, and to the present period of 3j years when whole-time service was raised to two years in 1950.    The Act requires that during their period of reserve service National Service men may be required to perform60 days1 training in all, no more than 21 days of which may be requiredin any one year.    Provided that the statutory liability is not exceeded, theactual amount of training v/hich a man is required to perform is a matterof administrative decision.18, The Admiralty and the War Office have made full use of these provisions for part-time training.    Generally speaking, only thoseexcused on compassionate grounds or for occupational reasons do not undertake it.In the Navy, part-time national service reservists normallycarry out two or three periods of annual training during the 3 jj- years.Each period is about 20 days.In the Army, the majority of national service reservistscarry out three periods of 15 days&apos; training, while those serving in theTerritorial Army carry out the balance of their 60 days1 training at week-end camps and drills.It has not been the policy of the Air Ministry to give part-time training to reservists who would not be required at the outset of war.In consequence, many of the Royal Air Force national service reservistsare not given any training at all during their period of reserve service,or at all events substantially less than that given to those in the other two Services.Exceptions to this are the Royal Air Force national servicereservists earmarked for the reserve  Lights, especially the control and reporting system.    It is expected that of those passing into the reserveeach year from now on about 5,000 will be required to do three periods of 15 days&apos; training during the 3 fyears.19, I have considered whether it would be possible to make substantial reductions in these arrangements.    Such reductions would belogical because the earlier conception of national service as a means ofbuilding up a large pool of trained reserves is out of date.    On the otherhand, it would be difficult to come to a final conclusion about part-time service without deciding in particular upon the future role of the reservear,my.    It is also important to have regard to the structure and morale of the Territorial Army.    Account must also be taken of the need forthe efficiency of the two divisions from the reserve army promised tothe North Atlantic Treaty Organisetion,20, . On the assumption that the primary role of most armyreservists in a nuclear war would be to assist to preserve some sort of organised society in these islands and to deal with small-scale raids andsaboteurs, I believe that it would be possible to restrict the trainingrequired of them as follows :-
(a) Those in the Territorial Army - X drills withintwelve months of their discharge and one periodof 15 days&apos; camp.(b) Those in the Army Emergency Reserve (whichconsists of specialised and technical personnelincluding dockers, engine-drivers, etc.) - asmuch training up to the limit laid down for tirosein the Territorial Army as may be desirable and administratively possible.(c) Mobile Defence Battalions - as they do no drillsduring the year I think it would be reasonable to expect them to do two periods of 15 days1 camp.If they do not do as much as this, I do not thinkthat they can become effective units.E.oyal Navy and Royal Air Force reservists should be dealtwith on analogous lines.INDUCEMENTS FOR THE REGULAR ELEMENT21. Consideration of the figures set out in this paper has increasedmy anxiety about the rundown of the regular element of the Services.    Thisis already alarming.    It is therefore most important to deal with, any reduction in the burden of military service in such a way as not toaggravate this situation,    I and my Service colleagues also regard it as essential that any statement of the Governments decisions in this matter&apos;should include an announcement of the Governments intention to make substantial improvements in conditions of pay and service for the regularelement.    The more precise this announcement can be made the better.RE C OMMENDATIONS22. Accordingly, I recommend -(a)   with regard to the reduction of manpower in theServices, course (e) set out in paragraph 14above.(b) a reduction in part-time training along the lines set out in paragraph 20 above.(c) an announcement of the intention to improveconditions of pay and service for the regularelement.The Service Ministers are unanimous in supporting therecommendation that the Government should adopt method (e) withregard to full-time service.    They are also agreed that the requirement to do part-time training can, to some extent, be reduced.S.L.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,September, 1955.
