THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 19551SECRET Copy No. 6 6CP. (55) 15014th October, 1955CABINETSUMMER TIMEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Prime Minister has asked me to raise the question of extending the periodof summer time next year.2. Under the Summer Time Acts, 1922 and 1925, the period of summer timeruns from the day following the third Saturday in April (or if that day is EasterDay, then the day following the second Saturday) to the day following the firstSaturday in October. The Summer Time Act, 1947, enables a different period tobe fixed by Order in Council after affirmative resolutions have been passed byParliament. This power was used in the years .1948 to 1952 to lengthen the period.(The period in 1947 was fixed by the Act itself.)3. My predecessor advised the Home Affairs Committee in 1952 and 1953(H.A. (52) 153 and HA. (53) 127) that summer time in 1953 and 1954 should end onthe day fixed by the 1925 Act.4. Towards the end of 1953, the National Farmers&apos; Union in England andWales passed a resolution in favour of extending summer time in 1954 by two weeks. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries believed, however, that thechange of opinion was not yet complete, and that the Union was still divided on thequestion. The National Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland remained firmly opposed toany extension.5. In 1954, the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Fuel and Power,who are concerned with the conflicting interests in this matter of the farming community and the need to save coal, and the Secretary of State for Scotland agreedthat there were no longer such special circumstances as would justify invoking thespecial powers in the Act of 1947. My view which had previously been expressedby my predecessor to the Home Affairs Committee was that, in the absence ofsome exceptional reason (such as existed in 1947 and the few years following), itwould be wrong to use the power of the 1947 Act indefinitely, to make changes yearby year. If a permanent change was to be made, it should be done by permanent legislation. Accordingly, when announcing in the House of Commons on21st October, 1954, the duration of summer time in 1955, I stated that theGovernment had decided that it would not be right to ask Parliament in future toconsider the use of the special powers given by the Summer Time Act, 1947, to effect annual changes in the statutory period unless there were most exceptionalreasons to do so (Official Report column 197).G.
