secret.P.(55) 13020th September, 1955CABINETNATIONAL SERVICE: DEFERMENT FORAGRICULTURAL workers memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and I were approached by the National Farmers1 Unionsof Scotland and England just before the Election this year, with, a request -that the present system of call-up of men from agriculture for NationalService should be discontinued and that there should be a reversion to theposition existing prior to 1951 in which all agricultural workers were given&quot;blanket&quot; deferment.2.       After consulting the Election Business Committee (E.3.C. (55) 4thMeeting), a deputation from the two Unions was received      me; theJoint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agrieult-tre,Fisheries and Food and representatives of the Scottish Office were also present.3.        The deputation made out a strong case for special steps to be takento preserve the manpower position in the agricultural industry and Ipromised that their representations would receive the careful considerationof the new Government.4.       Later in the summer, the Secretary of State and the minister informed me that the manpower position in the industry was becoming so serious that they were now convinced that urgent measures must be taken.They agreed, however, that a decision on this particular aspect of NationalService must await consideration of the major question now before theCabinet in C.P. (55) 125.5.        The number of agricultural workers available from each age classis approximately 15,000.    Until now 6,000 of these have been called up for national Service and 2,000 more have volunteered for the Armed Forces.6.&apos;       Under present arrangements agricultural workers born before1933 are, in general, not called up unless they leave agricultural employ-ment.Men born on or after 1st January, 1933, are regarded as eligiblefor call-up; limited deferment may be granted on the employer&apos;s applica-tion (or on the man&apos;s own application if he is self-employed), but the objectof any deferment granted is to enable such arrangements to be made aswill make it possible for the worker concerned to be called up eventually.Applications can only be made in respect of (a) workers on small farms or(b) stockmen, and essential conditions of the grant of deferment areCOPY NO.
that the holding is making a significant contribution to food production, thatit is impracticable to make alternative arrangements and that there is no prospect of obtaining a replacement within a reasonable period.Any further concession in the call-up makes it more difficult tomaintain the principle of universality of national service and, although thepresent labour position in agriculture is such that substitution is impossibleover the majority of the field and deferments continue from year to year,I am nevertheless anxious to avoid any extension of the blanket defermentsystem.7,        I propose, therefore, in order to meet the exceptional circumstancesof the agricultural industry, that every full-time worker in agriculture ahould be eligible for consideration for deferment on the same tests as nowapply to the small farms.    It is estimated that this concession would resultin at least a further 2,500 deferments a year and would reduce the annualintake into the Forces of National Service men to 3,500,This year, as in previous years, no men are being called up from agriculture during the period of the 14 weeks &quot;harvest suspension&quot;,    hiorder to meet local conditions these periods vary from Region to Region:the earliest date of termination is 15th October for Wales and the latest26th November for the Eastern Region,Under present arrangements the men due to be called up at theend of the harvest period are in two groups: those who have already beenconsidered and rejected for normal deferment: and those who wereineligible for consideration.    The former group will not be affected bythe new arrangements and will be called up at the end of their harvestperiods.    It is proposed that the latter group should be brought within thescope of the new arrangements and be eligible for consideration fordeferment,8,        My Ministerial colleagues and the two Farmers1 Unions haveexpressed grave concern about the uncertainty in the position of at least20,000 agricultural workers whose call-up has been deferred since 1952,Because of the uncertainty of their position, many men are asking to becalled up or are volunteering for regular service in order to put their service behind them before settling down in marriage,9.       It is proposed therefore that an early announcement should be madegiving an assurance to the industry in respect of men under deferment that,if the conditions justifying their deferment still exist when their 26th birthdayapproaches, they will continue to be deferred even though this means thatthey will pass out of liability and will never be called up,10,      I should hope that the two proposals which I have outlined above will go a long way towards satisfying the two National Farmers&apos; Unions,and that the two Workers1 Unions will also accept them,    I would, however,propose, in conjunction with my Ministerial colleagues, to consult bothsides of the industry before making any public announcement which should,if possible, be included in the statement to be made about the future ofthe National Service scheme as a whole.Summary of Recommendations11,       I accordingly recommend - and I understand that my two colleagues are prepared to agree - that I should be authorised to approach both sides of the agricultural industry with the proposals that - &apos;
(a) eligibility for consideration for deferment of call-upof agricultural workers should be extended to allfarms irrespective of size (paragraph 7); and(b) an early announcement should be made to reassure the farming industry that men who are-deferredwill not be called up regardless of productivityconsiderations merely because they are approaching the upper age limit of liability (paragraph 9).W.M.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S. W. 1.19th September, 1955.
