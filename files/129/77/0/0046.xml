(55) 1467th October, 1955CABINETPOST OFFICE finance memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralDuring the war capital investment in the Post Office virtually ceased. Sincethe war it has been greatly restricted. As a result nearly 380,000 people are waiting for telephones, and many Post Office buildings are decrepit.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with my predecessor that thecapital necessary to overcome the arrears should be made available, provided thatthe Post Office revised its tariffs and increased its provision for depreciation.3. Recent events have made it necessary to scale down capital development.I have agreed to accept less than is needed while still observing the conditions ofthe original bargain.4. I have thought it right to make this the occasion for a comprehensive review of Post Office finance and development. My proposals, as amended in thelight of the current economic position and approved by the Home Affairs Sub-Committee on Post Office finances, are embodied in a draft White Paper a copy ofwhich is attached. I should like to lay this White Paper before Parliament as soonas possible after the House resumes.5. It is proposed to return to &quot; self-contained finance &quot; by resuming theannual fixed contribution to the Exchequer instead of the Exchequer absorbing thewhole Post Office surplus as has happened since 1939. This contribution will be 5 millions.6. \The annual provision for depreciation will in future be calculated at current prices, instead of at the prices of the equipment when installed. The 12-J- millions which this will cost in increased depreciation next year represents areduction by this amount of the Post Office draft on the nation&apos;s reserves for capital development.7. Rising wages will cost the Post Office  14 millions more in 1956-57 than in1954-55; rising prices will cost another  3 millions.8. Taking these three factors into account it will be necessary to raise PostOffice annual income by  25 - millions. Of this,  19 millions should come fromtelephones and the remainder from posts.9. Telephone rentals should contribute substantially. Those classes of rentalwhich show the greatest loss should bear the greatest increase. In particular, theprovincial residential subscriber now obtains his service for only half of what itcosts the Post Office; this is clearly an important factor in encouraging demand.It is his rental which should rise most steeply, and it will be from him that the mostvigorous criticism will come.10. Local calls now charged at \%d. cost rather more than 2d. Accordinglyit is proposed to raise the charge to 2d.11. On the postal side, the increase in railway rates makes it necessary toincrease the charges for inland parcels.  Heavy losses require an increase in the48869Copy No. 69
2charges for overseas parcels and for inland printed papers. In addition I proposeto increase the charge for inland letters weighing more than 2 oz. as the least objectionable way of raising the rest of the money.12.   Neither the basic rate of 2\d. for the 2 oz. letter, nor the call box fee of() &apos;t\ 3d. will be raised.13. The increased charges will be very unpopular. But I believe the case forthem to be sound and their general effect to be deflationary. The proposals, taken as a whole, constitute a major and realistic recasting of Post Office finances in line with current economic needs.14. I ask my colleagues to approve the proposals set out in the White paper and to authorise its issue.C. H.General Post Office, E.C. 1,6th October, 1955.\

liftPOST OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCEINTRODUCTION(1) In the war years, there was a virtual cessation of capital investment inthe Post Office except for defence purposes. Since the war, capital develop-ment has been necessarily restricted. As a result there are today large arrearsstill to be overtaken, particularly on the telephone side. The Government want to rectify this state of affairs as speedily as the economic position of thecountry will permit, and in this connection have been examining the finances of the Post Office with a view to placing them on a sounder basis. Theproposals for capital development in this as in other fields have necessarilyhad to be adjusted to the current economic position.PART I: DEVELOPMENTI. TELEPHONESThe Problem(2) Nearly 380,000 people are waiting for telephones. 40,000 of them have been waiting for 3 years or more. This year it is expected that about half a million new applications will be received, though plant will be availablefor little more than half the people in the queue.(3) The position, though unsatisfactory, is somewhat better than it was,for in September, 1951, there was a waiting list of half-a-million applicants.During the past 4 years, 1,470,000 applications for telephone service havebeen met. There has been a net increase of over a million in the numberof telephones.  Today there are more than 6-J million telephones in use.(4) The capital investment in telephones and the growth of the systemduring the past 4 years are shown in the following Table:  table i	Financial	Telephone Investment	Net growth of system during year		year ending 31st March		Telephone4 stations	Exchange4 connections1952 ......... 1953 ......... 1954 ......... 1955 .........		 m. 50-0 60-0 66-4 70-1	290,128 210,745 268,993 355,372	171,950 127,940 178,690 237,443* Stations are all telephones including those on extensions and private branch exchanges.Exchange connections are subscribers&apos; lines connected to an exchange, each exclusive linecounting as one and each shared line counting as two connections.(5) The business demand remains fairly steady. During the past 4 years566,500 business applications have been met. Excluding orders now beingfulfilled, there is today a waiting-list of some 70,000 business applicants,including 12,000 farmers.331365 A 2!
(6) The demand for residential telephones has risen steeply. The volumeof new demand from residential applicants is now well over half as muchagain as in 1952. The full story of this upsurge is shown graphically inAppendix 1. A telephone is now regarded as a social necessity by an increasing number of families yet another indication of the present high standard of living and it can hardly be doubted that this spate of applica-tions has been encouraged by the rates which are charged.The Prospect(7) The distribution system for- telephones is more complicated than for electricity, water or gas, for it involves more than tapping the mains. Aseparate pair of wires is required between the exchange and each subscriber each pair of subscribers in the case of shared service. Once all the planthas been brought into use, there is needed either new exchange equipment maybe a new exchange or new cables, or both. All these involve substantialinvestment in apparatus, buildings and cables, and new recruitment to thePost Office engineering staff. Lacking any one of these, arrears cannot bemade good or progress made.(8) The aim of the Post Office is to reduce outstanding applications fortelephone service to manageable proportions as quickly as possible. Forthe time being its plans have had to be Scaled back because of the generalneed to reduce the claims of home demand on our national resources. Butit is the Governments intention that the Post Office should speed up thesupply of telephones as quickly as the economic condition of the country will permit. About 200 new telephone buildings will be started in 1956-57, morethan three-quarters of which will be exchanges. This is ah increase ofabout one-third over the present year&apos;s programme. Nearly half a millionhew exchange connections will be made in 1956-57. The rate of installationshould increase somewhat in the two following years and, allowing fortelephones given up, there should be about 8 million telephones in service in March, 1959. To achieve this objective there will have to be installedabout 1 million more pairs of wires, and exchange equipment (includingreplacements) for t nearly 1% million subscribers. Even so there will stillbe many areas where people will have to wait some time for telephones.Meanwhile technical development does not stand still. Post Office plans are indicated in the following paragraphs.Improvement of the System(9) Atitdmatic exchanges. At present 76 per cent, of British telephones are connected to automatic exchanges for local calls. Most of the remaininglocal manual exchanges are worn out and their replacement by modern auto-matic exchanges has become a matter of urgency. Looking further ahead,the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill is working on the applicationof electronic techniques to telephone switching.(10) Shared service. Shared service was introduced in 1942. Since 1948all new and removing residential subscribers have been liable to share theirlines when there is need. They cannot be released from this liability until there is enough cable capacity for all who want exclusive lines to be offered- them. This is the long-term aim, but progress towards it in many localitieswill take time. Nearly a million subscribers are now sharing. One third of residential subscribers are sharing lines. In the U.S.A. two-thirds of residentialsubscribers are sharing, half of them with more than one other party.&quot;(11) Trunks. The number of public trunk circuits increased from 9,430 inMarcn, 1&apos;945, to 21,115 in March, 1955. This growth has been made possible by the great advances in scientific research and technical devdopmeht.
2 oOn the main routes coaxial cables are providing circuits at much reducedcost. Trunk traffic has been increasing recently at a rate of rather over 10 percent, a year, and a further increase in the number of public trunk circuits is needed. At least 4,000 more will be added during the next three years. ThePost Office is also starting to build a chain of radio stations a radio relaysystem extending from South to North through the centre of the country.When completed in about four years&apos; time, the chain will have an ultimatecapacity for several thousand telephone circuits and a number of televisionchannels for the transmission of B.B.C. and I.T.A. programmes.(12) Subscriber trunk dialling. At present all calls over 15 miles arehandled by operators. Prior to 1939 several operators were required to setup each such call. The Post Office then started putting in operator-controlleddialling equipment for calls between the principal cities. This mechanisationis now being extended so that eventually no long-distance call will need morethan one operator to set it up. This will reduce both the time taken to obtaintrunk calls and the operating costs. The next step will be to enable subscribersto dial long-distance calls themselves. Most calls are already handled thisway in the compact telephone systems of Holland and Switzerland, and thefacility is rapidly being developed in other European countries, and in theU.S.A. where distances are much greater than here. The necessary equipment to enable subscribers in the United Kingdom to dial trunk calls is beingdesigned and will be ready for a first installation within four years. One ofthe early applications will be inter-dialling between some of the largest towns.This development will lead to a further reduction in operating costs and to  still more speedy and economical long-distance service.(13) New coin boxes. It is intended to introduce a new coin box aboutthe same time. It will provide long distance dialling facilities on calls from public call offices. The box will make possible the timing of local calls fromcall offices and the use of threepenny bits in the coin slots.(14) Overseas communications. The capacity of our telephone cables tothe Continent has increased from 200 circuits in 1945 to over 1,000 today.On the longer cables in the North Sea submarine amplifiers have been usedvery successfully to increase capacity. The major project at present being undertaken by the Post Office is, however, our part in the transatlantic telephonecable. This will cost  15m., shared between Great Britain, Canada and theUnited States. With its completion in 1956, telephone service between thetwo continents should enter into a new era ; quality of service will be improved and growth no longer restricted by shortage of radio frequencies. Thecompletion of the new Rugby Radio Station will improve our other overseascommunications.II. TELEGRAPHS(15) The main task in the inland telegraph service is, in co-operation withthe Staff Associations, to adjust staff to the declining traffic so that the loss on the public service is kept to a minimum. In order to help remote com-munities, it is proposed to make free delivery universal. It is also proposed toextend the latest hour for the acceptance of overnight telegrams from 10 p.m.to midnight.(16) The automatic switching of telegraph circuits, which imports thetechniques of the automatic telephone exchange into the telegraph service,avoids retransmission and contributes to economy. The telex service hasrecently been reorganised, inland and overseas services being integrated, andit is now forging ahead. Plans are being made for the conversion of this service to a national dialling system in about five years&apos; time.31365
35(17) The Post Office would like to speed up the completion of the early morning delivery of letters. The practical obstacles are, however, cou-siderable. To complete the delivery 15 minutes earlier in towns generally would involve the employment of some 3,000 more men and an increase ofabout  1J m. in annual expenditure. It cannot therefore be done ait present.The inland parcel post service is to be improved by the introduction wherever practicable of a second parcel delivery in the business areas of all townsof any size which do not already have one. It is intended to makegreater use of air transport to accelerate the delivery of mails, and inlandletters will shortly be sent by a number of air services which have not hitherto been used for mails. The possibility of making further use of inland air services is being studied. Meanwhile, the air mail services with overseasdestinations are being developed. By far the greater part of the lettersposted in this country for Europe are now carried by air without extracharge.(18) Many post-offices and sorting offices would have been rebuilt manyyears ago but for the war and post-war restrictions. A good start will bemade in overtaking these arrears. The plans for 1956-57 include about 100such offices, an increase of one-half on the planned programme for thepresent year.(19) The Post Office is studying the whole problem of handling mail insorting offices. A special enquiry is to be made into the layout of the fittingsused and the manual processes involved. An outside organisation specialisingin problems of work study is to be invited to make a detailed examination ofa number of sorting offices, to ensure that no possibility is neglected of improving efficiency and working arrangements.(20) In addition, postal mechanisation is receiving much attention and increased research and engineering effort is to be put into it. Conveyors havebeen in use in sorting offices for many years but recently a new type of mailconveyor has been introduced and a machine developed which will sortparcels at the touch of a button. Much thought has been given to the problems involved in the mechanical sorting of letters and a machine has been producedand has recently been brought into service experimentally in one of the sortingoffices. Long term possibilities, still in the experimental stage, are mechanicaland photo-electric devices which will divide up into different categories allposted letters and arrange them for date-stamping, thus avoiding muchlaborious handling. Several mechanical devices designed to speed up orrelieve the work at public counters have been developed and tested and some are now in regular use.iv. capital development(21) The estimated Post Office expenditure on development and renewalsduring the present year is  92-5 m., including  87-7m. for telephones. A three-year plan is indispensable for ordered telephone development, but, in common with other bodies, the Post Office must accept that the economic situationdemands some slowing-up in the immediate future of the expanding develop-ment programme it could otherwise undertake. The programme has been cutdown accordingly, and as outlined in this paper it is based on an outlay duringthe next three years at present restricted to slightly over  300m., nearly 95 percent, of it on telephones. In Commercial terms, and with the depreciationprovisions proposed later in this paper, net borrowing from the exchequer would be about  160m.
3 PART II: FINANCEVI. RISING COSTS(26) Prices charged should be economic and related to cost, for only onsuch a realistic basis can the fresh expenditure of capital be justified. Manyof the present Post Office tariffs do not cover costs.Current Costs(27) During the past four years (1951-52 to 1954-55) pay increases haveadded  42m. a year to the Post Office bill for current expenses. Many ofthese increases have resulted from awards of the Arbitration Courts whichthe Post Office is committed to accept. They are all the natural result ofthe rising wage rates paid in industry generally. Increases in the rates paidto the railways and steamship companies for the conveyance of mails, and(22) The nub of the reforms ensuing from the Bridgeman Committee of1932 was &quot;self-contained finance&quot;, involving a limit on the use of the PostOffice as a revenue-producing instrument for the Exchequer. It meant the fixing of a definite contribution to the Exchequer beyond which any netearnings were at the disposal of the Post Office. The objects were to givethe Post Office an opportunity to show that it could run its services withenterprise and economy, to promote better understanding by the public ofthe commercial basis of its activities, and to facilitate a less meticulous Trea-sury control of the Post Office.(23) The system then introduced was suspended during the war. It hasnow been decided to bring into force from 1st April, 1956, for a trial periodof five years, arrangements having a precisely similar effect. These arrange-ments are set out in Appendix 2. They provide for an annual contribution of  5m. in the Post Office Commercial Accounts, of which half would be attributed to Posts and half to Telephones.(24) The pre-war annual contribution (1933-1939) was  lOJm. It was fixed arbitrarily on a basis of the average cash surplus for the three yearspreceding its introduction, and no principles were laid down for futureguidance. The  5m. now proposed may be compared with recent commercialsurpluses, which have averaged in the past four years nearly  6m., and whichrepresent in effect what has accrued to the Exchequer. The Post Office doesnot pay most forms of taxation, and on a commercial approach some composi-tion in lieu of taxation would be reasonable. Very broadly, it can be esti-mated that the proposed contribution of  5m. is in line with what the PostOffice would, but for its exemption, have been paying in recent years byway of taxation, including income-tax.(25) The pre-war system, based on an elaborate adjustment of the cashaccounts, involved the creation of a physical fund into which any surplus inexcess of the contribution was paid. This time a simpler procedure givingequivalent results will be established by basing the whole arrangement on theCommercial Accounts (by which in practice Post Office budgetary policy is determined). The intention is that the contribution shall be treated as an expense before striking the balance in the Income and Expenditure account which forms part of the Commercial Accounts. If a surplus then remainsit may be carried forward in the Balance Sheet as a revenue reserve and used,if necessary, to offset any deficit subsequently occurring. A deficit whichcould not be so offset would be carried forward and would have to be liquidated by a subsequent surplus.
in prices generally, have also added over  8m. to the annual bill. Nor hasthe effect of these increases yet been exhausted. By 1956-57 pay awardsalready granted will add another  14m. to the wages bill, and increases inother prices, already known, will raise Post Office costs by a further  3m.In short,  17m. more has to be found in 1956-57 to meet additional wageawards and other increased current costs. This is over and above the  50m.found in the past four years.Capital Costs(28) Rising costs naturally affect capital equipment also; the effect is most apparent in the telephone system. Present depreciation provisions donot reflect increases in replacement cost. Real assets are therefore beingrun down, with the present mortgaging the future. In the case of new plant,the customer pays less than it costs. This is because what he is charged for depreciation is based on the average historic cost of the whole system,and not on the cost of the new plant, which is about 50 per cent, greater.It is equally true that customers are not charged what old plant is now worth,because the provision in respect of depreciation only reflects historic prices.The historic cost of the telephone system will be nearly  700m. by the endof the present year, whereas at current prices the cost of a system givingequivalent facilities is estimated to be over  1,000m.(29) For the past ten years the Post Office has, like most business concerns,acknowledged the inadequacy of its standing depreciation provisions. Ithas made special additional provisions, arbitrarily fixed at one quarter ofthe telephone surplus and totalling  17m. over the period. But the excesscost of renewing its old plant at current prices in the same period has totalledabout 60m.(30) The total provision on a historic basis in the coming year will be over  29m. Basing depreciation on current replacement costs, an amount ofover  43m. would have to be provided. To place the system on a soundereconomic footing it is thus necessary to budget for a supplementary provisionof  14m. After deducting  1-Jm. saved by obtaining longer life from exist-ing equipment it is still necessary to raise about  12-Jm. more revenue than if the present arrangements had continued in all respects unchanged. TheGovernments view is that from 1956-57 onwards provision should be madeaccordingly, subject to annual review by the Post Office of the amount re-quired. The effect will be that the Post Office will reduce by  12-Jm. a yearits draft on the nation&apos;s reserves for capital development.(31) During the past four years at least  50m. has been added to PostOffice current costs, most of it due to pay increases. By no means all ofthis was passed on to the public.  31m. was raised by tariff increases (mainlyimposed in 1951 and 1952) and another  5m. by increased charges to other government Departments for Agency services. The gap of  14m. wasbridged by internal economies, including those gained by expanding business,by greater technical efficiency and by a reduction in the surplus by  7m.Put in tabular form and in very round figures:  vii. the post office budgetTABLE iiIncrease in current costsPay increases ...Other price increases. m.428Increased tariffs     .........Payments   by   other  GovernmentMet by m.31Departments       .........Economies and increased efficiency...Reduction in surplus        ......577Total50Total50
(32) Conditions favourable to the growth of Post Office business still prevailand in assessing the prospects for the coming year it is assumed that theywill continue. Taking prices and wage-rates at their current levels, and making no allowance for any other changes, expenditure in the coming yearmust be expected to exceed that of 1954-55 by at least  17m. for increases in wage and price levels. Against this it is expected that, at present tariffs,about  3m. will be obtained from increased charges (mainly for Agencyservices) and about  6m. from economies. Thus, although the growth ofexpenditure will outstrip that of income by  8m. this is less than half theadditional expenditure due to rising costs.   Again in rough tabular form:-Increase in current costsWages........Other prices ...Totaltable hi m.

THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM(33) Unless tariffs are further increased, the  8m. shortfall in Table iii will alter the Post Office surplus of over  5m. in 1954-55 to a deficit of  3m.in 1956-57. In that case, the prospective outturn (commercial) for the latteryear would be as follows:  TABLE IV	 m.				Postal	Telegraph	Telephone	total income......      .........	153	18	139	310Expenditure     .........	155	20	138	313Surplus (-f)/Deficit (-)       ......	- 2	- 2	+ 1	- 3(34) Taking into account the other proposals in this paper, the additional cost elements which will have to be covered by tariff increases may besummarised as follows:  (a) payment to the Treasury of  5m. (para. 23);(Jj) the increase of depreciation provisions by  12^m. (para. 30);(c) a sum in respect of rising current costs sufficient to convert the pro-spective deficit of  3m. (para. 33) into an appropriate workingmargin.On the last point, it is necessary, especially in times of rising prices, to budget for something more than a bare covering of costs. For a business of the size of the Post Office, a surplus of  5m. would not be excessive. In appor-tioning this between the services, it is fair to regard the telephone as having a special responsibility for the telegraph deficit.
(35) Thus the additional income which the Post Office must aim to raisein the coming year from tariff increases is as follows:  TABLE V	 m.			Postal	Telephone and Telegraph	TotalInitial deficit (para. 33)............ Exchequer Contribution (para. 23)   ...... Supplementary Depreciation (net) (para. 30) Budgeted surplus (para. 34)    .........	2 2i 2	1 2i m 3	3 5 m 5	6i	19	25iTo this must be added the costs of improvement of services (paras. 15 and17), amounting to about   m. on current account. This makes a total of 25Jm. to be found. Most of the cost of improvements in the telephone service (paras. 9 to 13) is borne on capital account.IX. TARIFF PROPOSALS(36) It is proposed to raise the sums given in the preceding paragraph bytariff increases directed as follows:  table VITelephones:  Rentals   ............Local calls        .........Other heads      .........Telegraphs:   Ship-shore telegrams   ......Posts: Inland services.........Foreign parcels.........25-9All the new rates will come into force on 1st January, 1956.Telephones(37) The telephone rental is the part of the tariff most out of line withcosts. It is also the factor which most clearly affects demand. The present scale for exclusive service is shown in Table VII.table vn	Annual Rental		Business	ResidentialLondon        .................. 4 large cities*.................. Provinces      .........      .........	  11 10 9	 		8 7 6* Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester.There is a uniform abatement of 30s. a year for shared service. One hundredfree calls are allowed to residents, equivalent to 12s. 6d. Thus, presentannual rentals range from  11 for a London business exclusive line to  4 10s.(including 100 free calls) for a provincial residential shared line.75025171 m.1916-8
(38) Table VIII analyses on the basis of current cost the average profit orloss per telephone. (The revenue shown includes minor miscellaneous charges in addition to the rental. Business subscribers&apos; rentals allow for the reducedrates charged to Small Business Users and for auxiliary lines extra exchangelines numbered in sequence with the main number, e.g. MAYfair 4567/8).TABLE VfflLondon  s. d.a yearFourLarge Cities  s. d.a yearProvinces  s. d.a yearBusinessExclusiveRevenue.........Current Cost     ......Profit or LossSharedRevenue  ...Current CostProfit or LossExclusiveRevenue   ...Current CostSharedRevenue   ...Current CostResidentialProfit or LossProfit or Loss10 8 09 10  0i    18  09 14 08   0  0i 1 14  08 4 09 10  0-16  06 14 08   0  0-16  09 12 09   6  0+6   08 14 08   0  0-t-    14  07 4 09   6  02   2  05 14 08   0  0-2608 16 012 12  03 16  07 14 010 18   03   4  06 4 012 12  0- 6  8  04 14 010 18   06  4  0(39) The &quot; current costs &quot; shewn are identical for business and residentialsubscribers. This is unavoidable because costs of business and residentialtelephones cannot be separated. It is, however, probable that residentialtelephones are the more expensive to provide and maintain. The cheapestform of service now available, a residential shared line outside Londonand the four large cities, costs  4 10s. Od. a year in rental, 10s. dearerthan the cheapest form of service available before the war. The majorityof such subscribers are small users. Because of this, the average yearlynumber of calls has been falling. Taking into account that residents have thebenefit of 100 free calls, new provincial residential lines are now being suppliedat less than half their current cost.(40) The shared service differential of 30s. is not far out of line with cost.The business/residential differential of  3, on the other hand, has no founda-tion in ascertainable differences of cost. It is a traditional feature of thetariff. Where the amount is arbitrary, the level appropriate in prevailingcircumstances must be a matter of judgment. The Government have nodoubt that some reduction would be proper. Similarly whilst the geographicaldifferential (i.e., the  1 difference between certain localities), stems historicallyfrom the greater range of the unit call fee in London and the four cities,that factor is not today reflected in higher costs and a reduction in thisdifferential would not be unfair.
(41) A basic increase of  J a year on all lines is therefore proposed, coupled with a reduction of the business/residential differential from  3 to  2 andof the geographical differentials from  1 to 10s. The rebate for sharedservice will remain at  1 10s. Od. and 100 free calls will continue to begiven to residents. This means increases in rental varying from  1 a year for the London business subscriber to  3 a year for the provincial residentialsubscriber. There will be certain consequential increases for lines rentedunder the obsolescent Business Small User tariff, and for auxiliary lines, forlines connected to very small exchanges, and for lines connected to privatebranch exchanges owned and maintained by the subscriber. The presentand the proposed rentals are set out in Appendix 3. The new rentals, whichare estimated to produce an additional income of  9-75m. a year, will still leave the charges below costs for provincial subscribers, particularly residentialsubscribers, as shown in Table IX.TABLE IX	London   s. d. a year	Four Large Cities   s. d. a year	Provinces   s. d. a yearBusiness Exclusive Revenue...............

Itis clear that, after rentals, this is the major tariff item most in need of adjustment.(43) The call fee to subscribers for local calls (up to 15 miles radiusfrom the exchange) will accordingly be increased from lfd. to 2d. per unit asfollows:  Present ProposedUp to 5 miles       ............ lid. 2d.From   5 -1\ miles        ......... 3d. 4d.7i-12i miles      ......... 4-Jd. 6d.,,    12^-15 miles        ......... 6d. 8d.The additional income resulting is estimated at  7-0m. a year, including thatderived from a consequential increase in the fee for the cheap rate trunk callin the range 15-20 miles. There will be no increase in call office or coin boxfees.

These changes are justified by the cost ofthe service given.Telegraphs(45) The ship-shore radiotelegraph service is being run at a loss under a tariff fixed nearly ten years ago. To make the service financially sound thetariff will be increased as shown in Appendix 5. The increased income willbe rather less than  100,000.Posts(46) In the field of postal services it is proposed to increase the charges for inland letters exceeding 2 oz. in weight. The basic rate of 2-^d. for 2 oz.will not be altered. 95 per cent, of all letters are sent at this 2^-d. rate.Increases in inland parcel post rates are also required to meet additional payments to the railways following the recent increase in railway freight rates, and to reduce the existing deficit on the service. There is also a sub-stantial deficit on inland printed papers and samples, and it is proposed thatthis should be nearly met without increasing the charge for packets which donot exceed 2 oz. in weight. Other rates which call for review are those forthe express and redirection services, none of which have been changed sincethe last war and many not since 1919 ; the proposed increases will reducethe present deficit on these services. The estimated yield from all the changes proposed is  5-7m. made up as follows: - m.Inland letters over 2 oz. in weight     ............ 2-2Parcels (after deducting increased conveyance payment torailways)...............      ...... 1*7Printed papers, samples, etc.   ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1*7Express and other services     ......      ......... 0-1Details of the increases proposed are set out in Appendix 6.(47) On the overseas side it is proposed to increase the postage rate forparcels. These rates vary according to destination and for any particularroute are assessed in relation to the actual cost of conveyance over that route.Details of the new rates, which it is estimated will yield an additional  Mm.a year and so reduce a substantial deficit, will be published in the LondonGazette in due course.X. SOME COMPARISONS BETWEEN COSTS AND TARIFFS(48) Since 1939 the average wage paid by the Post Office to its employeeshas risen by about 175 per cent.; earnings have risen by approximately195 per cent. The rise in plant costs has been around 150 per cent. Onlytrunk circuits are cheaper to provide now than before the war. The capital investment required to connect one- subscriber by an exclusive line to hislocal exchange (for the apparatus in his house, his share of the cable to theexchange and his individual equipment in the exchange) is now around 100 two and one-half times what it was in 1939.(49) Compared with these increases, the cost to the public of using the postal and telephone services will remain relatively low even with the newtariffs. It is difficult to make an exact comparison between telephone tariffsto-day and those pre-war, but the average subscriber to-day pays around55 per cent, more than the average subscriber did in 1939. The effect of theproposals in this Paper will be to increase this bill to about 80 per cent, above
pre-war. A provincial residential subscriber who makes 400 local calls ayear pays at present 3s. Od. a week for an exclusive telephone and calls. Atto-day&apos;s prices this service costs the Post Office about 6s. Od. a week. In futurehe will pay about 4s. 6d. a week. If he shares the telephone, he pays, and.will still pay, 7d. less a week.(50) The average postage paid for inland letters and printed papers to-day is 88 per cent, more than pre-war. The proposals in this paper will raise thefigure to 98 per cent., but the cost of an ordinary letter will remain at 2- d.,which is only 66 per cent, above the l- d. charged before the war.PART III: SUMMARY(51) During the past four years, 1,470,000 applications for telephone servicehave been met. But the waiting list has fallen by only about 120,000. it now stands at 380,000 and demand is still rising rapidly. (Paras. 2-6 :Appendix 1.)(52) The Post Office will speed up the provision of telephones as much as national economic conditions will allow. Its programme has had to be scaledback because of the general need to reduce the claims of home demand on our national resources. But it is planned to connect up 1  million people duringthe next three years.   (Paras. 7, 8, 21.)(53) Post Office services will be improved. Full advantage is being taken of technical developments. In about four years&apos; time some subscribers willbe able to dial their own trunk calls. There will be increased facilities forlong-distance conversations, both inland and overseas. The telex service isforging ahead. Free delivery of telegrams is to be made universal and thelatest hour for accepting overnight telegrams will be midnight. wherever practicable, the second parcel delivery is to be extended to the business areasof all towns of any size which do not already have it. Further use is to bemade of inland air services.   (Paras. 9-17.)(54) New relations between the Post Office and the Treasury will be intro-duced. Henceforward the Post Office will contribute  5m. a year to theExchequer (roughly what it would pay in taxation) and retain for its own purposes any surplus earned above this sum.   (Paras. 22-25 ; Appendix 2.)(55) The prices charged for many Post Office services have become un-economic. The cost of new telephone equipment is now at least 2\ timeswhat it was in 1939. Rising prices necessitate  12^-m. additional annualprovision for the renewal of existing equipment.  17m. has also to be foundto meet additional wage awards and other increased current costs. Althoughthe impact of these increased costs is being reduced by internal economies,they alone would put the Post Office in deficit in 1956-7. Altogether it isnecessary to raise  25fm. additional revenue next year from the telephone and postal services.   (Paras. 26-35.)(56) In order to secure this sum, tariff changes are Droposed. Localtelephone calls will go up from 1-J-d. to 2d. and rentals will be increased by amounts varying from  1 to  3 a year. The new charges will bring the tariffs for the different types of service more nearly into line with their cost. The call box charge of 3d. remains unchanged. The 2^d. letter willremain unaltered. Some increases will be made in the charges for heavierletters, for printed papers and for parcels. (Paras. 36-47 ; Appendices 3 to 6.)(57) The effect of the proposals will be to bring the amount paid by theaverage telephone subscriber to about 80 per cent, above pre-war. Theaverage postage for inland letters and printed papers will rise to 98 per cent,more than pre-war. These increases of 80 per cent, and 98 per cent, compare with the 150 per cent, increase in the cost of telephone apparatus and the&apos;175 per cent, increase in Post Office wage rates.

post office relations with the exchequer. These arrangements will have effect for a trial period of five yearscommencing 1956-57.2. They are to be interpreted in terms of the Post Office Commercial Accounts.3. It is implicit that the principles and practices governing the compilation ofthose Accounts at the commencement of these arrangements will in all materialrespects remain unchanged during the period.4. The Post Office will hold itself under obligation to secure that its incomeas determined for the purposes of the General Income and Expenditure account shall be not less than sufficient, taking one year with another, to meet its expenditure as so determined, including provision for the matters specified inthe next succeeding paragraph.5. The specific matters for which provision is to be made are as follows:  (i) A Contribution to the Exchequer of  5m. p.a.   For the purposes of theService Accounts, this will be treated as debitable in equal parts to the postal and Telephone Services.(ii) Such supplementary provision for depreciation of telephone plant asrepresents, in the opinion of the Post Office, a fair estimate of theadditional amount required in order that the total provision made inany year shall reflect the current value of the assets in that year.(iii) Such additional provision for pension liability as may be required to liquidate over an appropriate period any ascertained deficiency in pastprovisions.6. Any surplus or deficit on the General Income and Expenditure Account(after making the above provisions) will be carried to a General Reserve Account.The balance on that Account will be carried to the General Balance Sheet asa reserve or deficiency as the case may be. In the former case it will be offset by an Exchequer liability to the Post Office ; in the latter by a Post Office liability to the Exchequer. These liabilities will bear interest at the rate currentlyappropriate to other Post Office transactions with the Exchequer, and such interestwill be credited or debited, as the case may be, in the General Reserve Account.7. The Post Office will continue to have both a general obligation to consult theTreasury on all financial matters which raise novel or important issues and a par-ticular obligation to do so in cases where only a limited financial power has been formally delegated. The Treasury for their part will give due weight to the fuller measure of responsibility for the pursuit of sound financial policies which,under these arrangements, naturally falls upon the Post Office, and the general understanding will continue that their criticisms will be directed primarily toobjective issues rather than to detailed points of administration.
