(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(55) 129 COPY NO.;   j^r20th September, 1955CABINETIMPORTS OF UNITED STATES FRUITNote by the Financial Secretary, treasury circulate the attached report by officials for consideration bythe Cabinet.H.B..Treasury Chambers, S. W,l.19th September, 1955.
IMPORTS OF UNITED STATES FRUITReport &quot;by the Mutual Aid committee this matters was last put to Ministers in !uP.,(55) 30 andwas considered by the Economic Policy Committee at their meetingon the 27th Julye    Officials then suggested a counter proposalto the American request that we should spend $30 millions betweenAutumn 1955 and Autumn 1956.    This was that the programme should be reduced to $25 millions, of which $6 millions were tobe spent on citrus (including $500,000 on canned grapefruit and$1 millions fresh grapefruit), subject to the conditions thatat least $20 millions of aid funds, which were expected to beavailable, should be used to finance the programme, and that weshould be free to use also any further aid funds which might become available later,    thus reducing or even eliminating the contingent liability to spend &quot;free&quot; dollars,2.     The Economic Policy Committee recognised in general thenecessity for agreeing to a comprehensive programme of fruitimports from the United States;  they considered, however, thattime should first be allowed for a West Indian Mission to go tothe United States to explain both to the Administration and tothe Citrus Industry there the difficulties of the West IndianCitrus Industry^    Mr. Manley, the Chief Minister of Jamaica,and Mr. Gomes, the Minister for Trade and Commerce of Trinidad,accordingly went to Washington and subsequently held a further meeting in Jamaica with representatives of the Florida CitrusCanners, which resxxlted in the agreement which is described inparagraph 69Non-citrus fruit3.     Meanwhile there was strong pressure from the Americans forsome progress to be made in the purchase of fruit, and theChancellor of the Exchequer authorised the making of an offertotalling $19 millions for the purchase of fruit other thancitrus.    Subject to certain technical points,, this offer has beenaccepted by the Americans.    The $20 millions of aid fundsalready allotted which it was proposed to use to finance theprogramme included the residue of the existing procurementauthorisation for citrus fruit amounting to $h.5 millions.    the americans now say that they are unwilling to reprogramme thisprocurement authorisation for another type of fruit.    Evidentlythey fear that we might subsequently agree to take only adisproportionately small amount of citrus.    They wish merely to prolong the life of the existing procurement authorisation forcitrus.    This alters the assumptions on which the $19 millionsproposition was made and we have told the Americans that we mustregard ourselves as being free to reduce the non-citrusprogramme by the whole amount of $h.5 millions.    Certain additionalamounts of aid have however now come to hand, sufficient to finance a programme of at least $15*9 millions exclusive ofcitrus; arrangements for such a programme have now been put in train,,
4.     The Americans will no doubt press us to agree an import programme to cover the balance between the $15.9 millions-ajreedand the earlier offer of $19 millions.    In diaouasing thenon-citrus programme it was made clear to them that officials had no authority to offer &quot;free&quot; dollars for this interim deal.The original American proposals put considerable emphasis ontheir desire for some &quot;free&quot; dollars to be spent on fruit, andthe counter-proposal (considered, but not agreed by Ministers)envisaged accepting this as a contingent liability.     Thegeneral economic situation of the United Kingdom, however, andthe measures taken in the internal and external fields, may bethought to be inconsistent with the expenditure of &quot;free&quot;dollars for fruit and Ministers may accordingly wish to considerwhether to reject any contingent liability to spend free dollars.They might, however, be prepared to maintain the original offer of $19 millions on non-citrus fruits provided that the balancebetv/een this higher figure and the $15.9 milliore already agreedis allowed in only at our discretion as and when aid fundsbecome available which cannot be used for other purposes.Citrus Fruit5.     In the earlier report to Ministers it was suggested that$6 million- should be allocated to the purchase of citrus fruit.This is the same amount as was included in the 1954/55 programme;it was not all used then because agreement was reached too late in the season for it to be effective, and in the coming seasonrising freight rates are&quot;likely to limit the amount of citrusfruit which will be taken by the United Kingdom market.     Theearlier report to Ministers proposed that within this amountof $6 million.we should agree to $500,000 for canned grapefruitand $1 million for fresh grapefruit.     We specified moreoverthat no timing conditions would be imposed on the import of fresh grapefruit and other citrus products.      Now that the americans propose to use the existing procurement authorityfor citrus fruit, as described in paragraph 3 above, there appears to be an opportunity for restricting our purchases tothis amount thus avoiding the contingent liability of spending free dollars on citrus fruit.     It is politicallyessential for the American authorities to achieve a reasonablefigure for citrus imports (at least $4.5 millions for example)although they recognise that the actual level of sales ofcitrus fruit may not be as high as this.      They may press fora larger figure.     Not only would this nnvolye the risk of spending free dollars but it would increase our embarrassmentwith the Colonies.     Ministers will wish to decide whether toaccept a contingent liability for the expenditure of freedollars for citrus fruit, by   agreeing a $6 millions citrusprogramme, or to reject it by restricting our offer to 4.5 millions.
6.     Within either figure it is necessary to consider whatamounts of canned and fresh grapefruit should be included in theprogramme.    The talks between the British West Indies and theFlorida producers, which were limited to canned grapefruit,resulted in agreement on the following basis.    (It was of coursefully understood by all from the outset that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not be bound by any agreement.)(a) The West Indies would be prepared to acquiesce inUnited Kingdom imports of 150,000 cases (roughly$500,000 worth) of canned grapefruit from theUnited States during the coming season, on thebasis that such imports &quot;will not prejudice in anyway the special interests and present position ofthe West Indian citrus industry in the United kingdom market&quot;.(b) To satisfy this condition it was agreed that purchases of United States produce would have to be made only from members of the Florida Citrus Canners organisation^who would give a prior undertaking to raise prices tobring them into line with those charged by west indies producers.(c) Certain other conditions were stipulated to which theWest Indians attach the greates^ira^ortsnce:(i) The United States canned grapefruit should be imported and on-sold by the Importers beforethe West Indian canners start to pack their1955 crop (that is to say by about the endof October).(ii) The additional receipts of the United Statesexporters resulting from sales at the higherWest Indian price to a total of not less than$50,000, should be spent promptly on the advertising and promotion of grapefruit ingeneral in the United Kingdom.7.     There are difficulties involved in accepting an arrangement of this sortw    Subject&apos; to certain modifications to therestrictions&quot;which would have to be imposed to carry out the agreed conditions, it would in fact be technically possible tomake some arrangements which would meet the West Indianrequirements; but the considerations of principle involved are such that it would be essential to carry the United StatesGovernment with us in approving the arrangements.    The american authorities have accordingly been consulted and while they arevery sympathetic to the idea of the two industries reaching agreement upon their joint problems, they point out that thereare two aspects of the agreement arrived at (the price fixingprovision and the limitation to certain suppliers) which arecontrary to the requirements of American law; thus it would notbe possible for them to authorise the expenditure of Aid funds for purchases under such an arrangement.    In view of thisAmerican reaction it is clear that the proposed arrangements areunacceptable,8.     It is however very unlikely that the Americans would accept any proposal on citrus which excluded canned grapefruitentirely and the Committee have considered whether there is any alternative to the scheme evolved by the British West indies and Florida Producers.    In their view the only safeguards for theWest Indies which could be applied in the immediate future wouldbe the limitation of American imports of canned grapefruit to aperiod when they would interfere least with West Indies marketing
from the new crop; In particular they propose a limitation bywhich American imports would be permitted only in the period up to 31st December, which is the shortest time in which it is reasonable to expect the importers to move the suggestedquantities of canned grapefruit.   Although this does not givethe West Indies all they want it does give them a reasonabledegree of protection.   Its essence is speed; delay will causedamage to West Indies interests by creating the worst trading conditions for their products.   There is however an obligation on the United Kingdom Government to consult the Colonies withregard to all Aid-financed fruit imports and in particular withregard to the import of canned grapefruit in the period up to31st October.    The Committee, therefore, recognise that theColonies must be consulted in the first place, and that thisshould be done urgently; none the less the majority of theCommittee feel that the proposal suggested is the mostconsistent with the general interest of the United Kingdom andof the Colonies concerned and should be adopted.9.     The Colonial Office would not be prepared to say that theproposal in the preceding paragraph would be acceptable to theWest Indies.    In view of the part which the citrus industry playsin the political and economic life of the West Indies, thenegotiations which have already taken place between the twoindustries, and the importance to the West Indian industry of strengthening the contact they have established with the Americanindustry, the Colonial Office consider it important that theWest Indian Governments should be consulted again before any decision is taken.    If this is not done our relations with theWest Indian Governments will undoubtedly be seriously damaged and the talks with the West Indian Ministers on the PriceAssistance Scheme for the citrus industry, which are to be resumed at the end of the month, will be even more difficult.The Colonial Office consider that the West Indian governments should be informed by telegram of the objections to thearrangements negotiated between the West Indian and Floridacitrus industries and moreover should be t ;1&amp; that if they wishedto arrange for further talks between the two industries to see whether they could modify the arrangements to meet thoseobjections we should be willing for them to do so.    In that event, since the proposed time limit for the import of Americansegments into the United Kingdom could not be achieved, the west indian industry would, no doubt, try to get agreement to therestrictions of Imports to some other period during the yearcovered by the Aid Programme which would be least harmful tothe West Indian industry.   The telegram to the West Indies could then go on to state the proposal in the preceding paragraph as one that we should have to consider if the West Indies decideagainst further negotiations with the Florida citrus growers, and since this proposal involves a time limit for the import of american segments we should wish to know the views of the west indian Governments as quickly as possible.10.   The discussion between the British West Indies and american interests did not cover other citrus fruits.   Mr. Manley saidthat the United States had no interest in exporting fresh grape-fruit or other citrus products to the United Kingdom at this time, and had urged that the United Kingdom should not agree toany such Imports.   The American Administration on the other hand,have made it clear that they have a substantial interest in securing at least a token import of fresh grapefruit, as wellas other citrus fruits.   It is suggested therefore that a tokenamount of $1 million of fresh grapefruit (without restriction asto the date of entry) should be included in the 0h*5 millionsprogramme.    In this connection there is a commitment to consult the Colonies concerned and the Colonial Office consider thattheir Governments should be told, at the same time as the communication to them of whatever decision is reached on canned
grapefruit, that the United States Government have definitelyasked for the inclusion immediately of fresh citrus in theprogramme and they should be asked for their views on theproposals in paragraph 5 above.   (The views of the CyprusGovernment are already available; they have expressed strong objection to the lack of limitation on the period in which united States eitrus fruit will be imported.)Conclusions11.   Ministers are asked to decide -(a) Whether our offer on fruit other than citrus shouldbe modified in such a way that we are in no dangerof spending free dollars, and whether we should maintain our offer of $19 millions if this can beeventually financed wholly from Aid funds.(b) Whether, subject to consultation with theColonial interests concerned, our offer on citrusshould be limited to the $h.5 millions of theexisting procurement authorisation thus avoidingall risk of spending &quot;free&quot; dollars, on the basis that not more than $1 million would be spent onfresh grapefruit and $3 millions on other citrusfruits and fruit products (excluding canned grape-fruit), with no limitation as to the period of importation.(c) That the arrangements evolved between the british west Indies and Florida Industries and set out inparagraph 6 above are unacceptable.(d) Whether to accept the view of the majority of theCommittee that the British West Indies should beinformed that we are proposing to import$500,000 worth of canned grapefruit within theperiod up to 31st December, or whether to acceptthe dissenting opinion of the Colonial Office tothe effect that the British West Indies interestsshould be given further opportunities for negotiation with the Florida Producers before afinal decision is reached.
