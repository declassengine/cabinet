(55) 12215th September, 1955CABINETSECURITY CONTROLS ON EAST/WEST trade memorandum by the Minister of defence i suggest that the time has arrived to seek further policy discussions with the americans about the level of security controls on trade with the Soviet Bloc, in thelight of the new strategic concept.2. At their meeting on 17th February, 1954 (C.C. (54) 9th Conclusions,Minute 6), the Cabinet decided to press for a much shorter embargo list, based onthe concept of the &quot; long haul,&quot; and following discussions in Washington between mr. Thorneycroft and Mr. Stassen joint Anglo-American proposals were acceptedby the Paris Group which resulted in reducing the embargo list by 86 items.3. A few important items remained undecided, owing to continued pressure by the Americans for wider controls than we and other countries were prepared toaccept. Three of these, viz., merchant ships, rolling mills, and copper wire, arestill outstanding. It is evident from the discussions on these items that the americans are still thinking in terms of retaining the embargo as far as they canon all items of industrial equipment which might be regarded as of some assistanceto the Soviet Bloc in waging a prolonged war of the conventional type.4. During the past year the recognition that the thermo-nuclear bomb wouldbe used in a major war has revolutionised the whole basis of our strategic planning.We no longer attach the same importance to the build-up of industrial capacity orof stockpiles of industrial raw materials for a long term productive effort afterthe outbreak of global war. Nor do we feel that the expansion of industrialmanufacturing capacity and the accumulation of raw materials by the Soviet Blocare so serious a strategic menace in the new circumstances as they have been inthe past.5. Even before the strategic situation was transformed by the hydrogenbomb, we had recognised that the embargo on exports from the Western worldcould have only a marginal effect on the growth of industrial power in the soviet bloc or on its capacity to wage a prolonged war. As far as we can judge the embargo has had practically no effect on the quantitative build-up of the SovietArmed Forces in peacetime. The Bloc is in a position to direct, and has no qualmsabout directing, a high proportion of its resources into arms production at theexpense of the civil population. Moreover, it has vast natural resources of its own and has rapidly developed both modern manufacturing capacity and the means of expanding it. The main value of the security controls has rested in the denial tothe Bloc of the more advanced types of equipment used in military production, of technological know-how of military application, and of atomic energy materials and a few raw materials of military importance of which they are known to becritically short. Nevertheless, as a form of protection against a total war of the48750
conventional type, the controls have hitherto been justified, as representing somehandicap to the development of the mass-production capacity which would be soessential in sustaining the vast Soviet Forces in a prolonged conflict.6. In the new situation, it is very questionable whether the political irritantsand the handicaps to world trade which result from the controls can any longer be justified by their results in terms of defence advantage. If we accept that any war in which we are opposed to Russia will be a global conflict and that in such a conflict thermo-nuclear weapons are bound to be used, the initial phase will beall-important. In this phase Russian Government organisation and industry willbe the principal targets of the Western strategic air attack. In all probability the outcome of the war will be decided in this phase, even though fighting may continue for some time thereafter with what forces and equipment are left. In thesecircumstances, such minor difficulties as we can impose upon Russia by securitycontrols in peace have little significance. What we need is a fresh approach to theproblem.7. My own view is that we should now eliminate from the list of controlleditems anything whose sole justification for inclusion is that denial to Russia wouldhamper her general industrial development and that we should confine the list toequipment and material which would, if exported, assist the Bloc in a militarysense in the initial phase of a major war or in preparation for that phase. Thismeans, in brief, that apart from Atomic Energy materials and Defence equipmentproper (including machinery specially designed for making it) we should nowrestrict the controls to:  (a) Items involving important Military know-how.(b) Specialised telecommunications equipment.In practice, this would amount to a fairly wide control over electronic equipment.No attempt would be made to control plant or machinery solely on the ground thatit could in war be turned over to the production of armour-plate, vehicles andconventional weapons; nor would there be any control of most types of merchantshipping or of the ordinary raw materials of industry.8. If we accept that this should be our general policy, our main problem willbe to convince the Americans that it is sound and justified by the new situation.Much less difficulty is likely to be encountered with the remaining members of the paris Group (the other North Atlantic Treaty countries and Japan) with thepossible exception of Canada, which is closely tied to the United States on exportpolicy because of their common open frontier.9.x An opening for an approach to the Americans has been provided by therecent request of the French Government for informal talks with the americans and ourselves to discuss East/West trade matters, in particular the reduction ofthe China controls and the streamlining of the Soviet Bloc controls. A tripartite meeting has been arranged for 3rd October, and it is desirable that we should settleour own policy before that meeting.S. L.Ministry of Defence,13th September, 1955.
