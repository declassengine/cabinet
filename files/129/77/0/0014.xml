I now invite the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions which have been reached,R.A.3.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,2nd September, 1955,Japan;  Trade and Payments negotiations at Cabinet on 26th August (C,M.(55) 29th Conclusions) I was invited to discuss with the Minister of State, Colonial Office, and theMinister of State, Board of Trade, the question of Japanese access toColonial markets, and to report further to the Cabinet at their next meeting,2, It is already agreed that we should only be justified in asking the Colonies to restrict their imports from Japan if we could make a clear and convincing case on balance of payments grounds.    In discussion betweenthe Economic Secretary and the other Ministers concerned, it has been further agreed that it was desirable to require certain further undertakingsfrom Japan in addition to the objectives set out in paragraph 5 of my paper c, (55) 108, as a safeguard against Japanese discrimination against sterling area exports, and in order to ensure that the Japanese quotas would not be frustrated by administrative devices,    A list of these further requirements is contained in the Annex,3, The Ministers concerned consider that these requirements areones which we can reasonably put to Japan, and that if they are accepted itwould be less difficult for the Government to defend an agreement with Japan
1%which involved an increase in Japan*s exports to the Colonies.    There would still undoubtedly be criticism from Lancashire, but on the other hand wecould point to the advantages we should have secured for other export industries.4. The Minister of State, Board of Trade, agrees that we should now go ahead with the negotiations on this basis and on the understandingthat satisfaction on non-discrimination on the lines set out in the Annexis as fundamental as satisfaction on the other points.    Final judgment onthe Colonial import question would, of course, have to be taken by ministers in the light of the Japanese reply.5. I agree with these conclusions and propose to report to Cabinetaccordingly.    It is, however, becoming rather urgent to get our negotiatorsback to Tokyo.    If you agree, I suggest that they should be authorised to travel this week-end, in the expectation that Cabinet will endorse theconclusions now reached.6. I am sending copies of this minute to the Foreign Secretary,the Minister of State, Colonial Office, the Minister of State, Board of Trade,and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Commonwealth relations office.(Signed) R.A.
