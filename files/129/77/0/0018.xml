THE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have read the papers circulated upon this topic and wish toput certain thoughts into the pool myself.    These comments are not made in contradiction to the observations of my colleagues but toemphasise certain features of especial importance to the conduct ofour trade and commerce.2.     There seem to me to be three central factors in the situation -the rate of exchange at which money can be sold abroad, the rate ofinterest at which money can be hired at home and the level of the reserves.    It may be possible to hold one or even two of these stable,but I believe it to be hard at any time and beyond the range of humaningenuity in times of over full employment to hold all three.3.     It was our main criticism of the policies pursued bySir Stafford Cripps in the past and it remains one of our principalcriticisms of Mr. Gaitskell&apos;s policies to-day that they tend to ignore the central factors in the economy and try to operate instead throughmarginal and selective physical controls.    We need to watch that inour natural desire to safeguard what we regard as worthwhile formsof expenditure we ourselves do not fall into the very errors which wecondemn in others.4.     The basic problem at home is a degree of inflation which is atonce the principal obstacle to exports, the main reason for risingimports. the foundation of the constant pressure of and yielding to wage claims and the necessary pre-requisite for the resort to capitalappreciation for income purposes and the general exuberance in the field of stocks and shares.    The Socialists lay emphasis on effects; wesurely should aim to deal with causes.5.    Artificially to stimulate consumption or for that matter invest-ment in the midst of an inflation is like prescribing whisky  to aconfirmed alcoholic.    Until recently we were selling coal well belowits true costs, an evil which is now ended.    Yet we still subsidise breaddespite the fact that imported grain places a heavy strain on our reserves in housing we subsidise in the public sector and deliberately depressrents in the private sector and we still give investment allowances not-withstanding the increase in the bank rate, though the demand which wethus artificially create stretches our resources of men and money tothe utmost.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.C.P.(55) 1183rd September, 1955CABE-IET
6.     What we need to do is both to deal with the inflation at itssource and demonstrably to be seen to do so.    The latter is necessaryto inspire confidence abroad and to bring home to businessmen thenecessity of adapting their actions to the policies we are pursuing.With this end in view I would propose three things:-(a) A rise in the bank rate and supporting market operationsI remain firmly of the opinion that as part of any solution we adopt we should raise the bank rate to a realistic level.    If a higher bank rate is said to be effective but is held in reserve it could be effectivenow.    If it is said to be technically ineffective thenwhy and for what purpose is it held in reserve?(b) Measures to reduce consumption and investmentI think that we should end the bread subsidy andthe general subsidy on housing.    In my judgment wewould be wise at the same time to abolish rent controlboth because this would tend to a more economic use of housing resources and because I believe we should be .in any event compelled to it at a later stage.Reluctantly I must also say that in present circumstances regard initial investment allowances as inflationary andhardly consistent with the use of the bank rate which Iadvocate above.    I would therefore recommend that weshould suspend them.(c) Reduction in Government expenditure cannot add much to the suggestions put forward by my colleagues except to say that in my judgmentinvestment in coal and atomic energy should not escape the general arrangements for postponement.    In thegeneral measures affecting investment many industriesimmediately engaged at critical points in our exportdrive will have to select some projects suitable forpostponement and I do not think that any industry, howeveressential, should be exempt from this healthy exercise.7.     What about wages?    It is said that if rents go up and bread goesup the pressure for wage concessions would prove irresistible.    the pressure is already proving irresistible.    The reason for the wage increases like the reason for higher dividends is the inflation, and wecannot continue -^aeaTwith the inflation on the ground that the measures necessary may themselves provoke wage claims.    No amount ofexhortation to trade unions or employers, nor in my judgment measureswhich attempt to restrict profits, will hold wages in existing circum-stances.    Wages will only be held when employers really take the viewthat they can no longer afford to pay an increase and trade unionistsrealise they can no longer afford to claim one and this point will not bereached until deflation has been carried further than at present.    Thesituation which we should have clearly in our minds as necessary to achieve is when the unemployment figure has moved from under 1 per cent to somewhere between say 2 and 3 per cent.

8.     Lastly how against the background of these events should welook at the Collective Approach?    Convertibility has always held itsdangers both for our export trade and our reserves.    In the past wehave thought of it in terms of a floating rate and international agree-ments for the early elimination of import controls.    More recentlythoughts have turned, I think, towards a much greater degree of fixityin the rate supported by a continuation of discriminatoiy import controls.    These are problems of a fundamental character.    I mustsay frankly that I would find it difficult to reconcile convertibilitywith discrimination and I believe that the right course is not to goconvertible until we can do so safely without these controls.    Thefirst thing is however to stop the inflation.    As the Chancellor hasalways said internal stability is a key condition for convertibility.9.     Any effective policy would certainly be politically unpopular.I think the worst thing we could do would be to put out anything whichcould be represented as a dribble of half measures.    Indeed if wego too far we can always manage to retreat a little whereas if we donot go far enough we shall lose the benefit of even those measureswhich we take.    I consider therefore that the interests of our tradeand commerce would be best served by the adoption of the measuresadvocated in paragraph 6 above.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.I.2nd September, 1955.
