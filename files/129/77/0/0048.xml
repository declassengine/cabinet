r?4THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1955SECRETCP. (55) 14813th October, 1955CABINETROYAL COMMISSION ON CAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh Affatrs and the Secretary of State for scotland on 29th July, 1954, the Cabinet considered a memorandum, C. (54) 166, bythe then Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland on therecommendations made in the report of the Royal. Commission on capital punishment (C.C. (54) 56th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. The Cabinet agreed not to accept the three major recommendations ofthe Commission (that is, (i) the raising from 18 to 21 of the statutory age limitbelow which sentence of death may not be imposed; (ii) conferring upon the jurya discretion to decide whether there are such extenuating circumstances as tojustify substituting a sentence of life imprisonment for one of death; and (iii) the abrogation of the McNaghten Rules in regard to insanity), but decided that no final decision should be announced until after Members of Parliament had hadan opportunity of expressing their views. The Cabinet also agreed that legislation should not be introduced giving effect to certain of the minor recommendations ofthe Royal Commission.3. , The report of the Royal Commission was debated in the House ofCommons on 10th February, 1955, on a Government Motion to take note of theReport. The Government spokesmen indicated that the Government hadprovisionally formed the view that the three major recommendations should notbe accepted, but that before coming to a final conclusion they wished to takeaccountxof the views expressed by Parliament. The debate turned mainly on theproposal, raised by an amendment to the Government Motion, that the death penalty should be suspended for a number of years. In so far as therecommendations of the Royal Commission were referred to, there was substantialsupport for the view that it was right to reject the first two of the recommendationsreferred to in paragraph 2 above. (Proposal (ii) had already been strongly criticised in the House of Lords.) There was rather more difference of opinion aboutproposal (iii), but no one could suggest any satisfactory alternative to theMcNaghten Rules, and there was little support for the proposition that the rules should be abrogated altogether.4. Nothing was said in the debate, or has been said subsequently, to causeus to suggest any modification of the conclusions reached by the Cabinet on29th July, 1954. Up to the present, the time has not seemed opportune for making any further statement as to the Governments decisions. It would not have beenappropriate to make a statement on this controversial matter before the generalelection; and since then it would have been difficult to dissociate a general statement from particular cases which were arousing public interest. The HowardLeague, however,-recently submitted a memorial, signed by a number of well-known people, urging that capital punishment be abolished or that at any ratethe recommendations of the Royal Commission be adopted, and we think it probable that as soon as Parliament reassembles there will be Questions as to theGovernments intentions.48895Copy No.63
5. We accordingly seek authority to announce that the Government havegiven careful consideration to the views expressed in the debates in both Houses^ and have reached the conclusion that they cannot accept the main recommendationst) of the Royal Commission and do not at present propose to introduce legislation to deal with the other recommendations. It would be explained that theGovernment did not necessarily accept all the minor recommendations (some ofwhich are controversial) but would reserve a decision until there was some prospectof legislation; and that those recommendations which were accepted by theGovernment and could be carried out administratively have, so far as possible,been put into effect.G. LL-G......... J. S.12th October, 1955.
