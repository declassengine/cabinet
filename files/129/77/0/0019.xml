I 1 oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1955SECRETCP. (55) 1196th September, 1955CABINETREDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Attorney-general  am not at all happy about the proposals in paragraphs 5, 8 and 9 of thememorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (55) 83).2.  The proposals in paragraph 5 are (a) that the Boundary Commissions should be relieved of the obligationsimposed on them by Section 2(1) of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, and(b) that the Boundary Commissions should only recommend changes toprovide against the dismemberment of local government areas or to correct major departures from the rules in the Second Schedule.3. I do not think that any alteration of Section 2 (1) is required. All it doesis to require the Commissions to furnish reports either showing what alterationsshould be made to give effect to the rules or stating that no alterations are required.It does not require them to bring all constituencies into complete conformity withthe Rules. Those Rules now provide for a considerable measure of flexibility and,if more flexibility is required, it should be given by amendment of the Rules, not of Section 2 (1).4. I am afraid I do not understand what is meant by the phrase &quot; to correctmajor departures from the rules as a whole.&quot; It is the words &quot; as a whole &quot; thatpuzzle me. Rule 1 fixes the number of constituencies. Rule 4 provides that &quot; sofar as is practicable &quot; local government boundaries and constituency boundariesshould coincide. Rule 5 provides that the electorate of any constituency shall beas near the electoral quota as is practicable having regard to the earlier rules. the commissions already have, therefore, very considerable discretion. They canrecommend cutting up local government areas to avoid an excessive disparity between electorates or on account of special geographical considerations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency. They can also, inorder to give weight to these geographical considerations, depart from the strict application of Rule 5, namely, making the electorate of a constituency as near the electoral quota as is practicable.5. I do not know whether it can be said that the Boundary Commissions have gone too far in recommending changes to bring electorates into line. If they have,then perhaps the point could be met by providing that they should not recommendchanges except to avoid or reduce an excessive disparity in electorates. I am not,however, in favour of doing anything to diminish the importance to be attached to rule 6 (departures for geographical considerations) or to the discretion given tothem under Rule 5. I fear that the result of restricting the Commissions to givingCopy No. gg48703
effect to Rule 4 and to correcting &quot; major departures from the rules as a whole &quot;might be that less importance would be attached to geographical considerations and less effect given to the Commissions&apos; power to disregard local government areasin order to prevent an excessive disparity between electorates.6.   I do not think the change proposed in paragraph 8 of the memorandum-is necessary.   It would merely give express statutory sanction to action, already taken by the Commissions on two occasions, which the Court of Appeal has held to be proper under the existing law.  To legislate as proposed in this paragraphwould re-open the question which gave rise to so much controversy in December.7. With regard to paragraph 9, the criticism that I have heard is that the boundary Commissions, after making their recommendations and receivingobjections to them, published revised recommendations without those affectedhaving any opportunity of protesting against the revisions. I certainly think anopportunity should be given of making representations in relation to revisedrecommendations where those recommendations constitute a substantial departure from those originally put forward.R. E. M-B.Law Officers&apos; Department,2nd September, 1955.
