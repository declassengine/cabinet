SECRET Copy No.   g8CP. (55) 13830th September, 1955CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of EducationWe submitted to the Home Affairs Committee at its meeting on 27th September(HA (55) 11th Meeting, Item 3) the offer which had been agreed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, and which we proposed to put to the Local Authorities andthe teachers as the Governments new scheme for teachers&apos; superannuation. Themain points of the offer are:  (i) The rate of contribution to be raised from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent.from 1st April, 1956 6 per cent, from the teachers, 6 per cent, fromtheir employers.(ii) The Exchequer to credit their Accounts with the sums required to makethe balance in each case equal to the net liability under the revised scheme as at 31st March, 1956.(iii) The present interest rate of the Account of 3  per cent, to be retained.(iv) Periodic valuation of the Accounts to be carried out as under the presentActs, but at intervals of five years instead of seven.(v) Any deficiency revealed by a valuation to be borne by the employers bya supplementary percentage contribution to be revised as necessaryupwards or downwards at subsequent valuations.2. It will be seen that the teachers are to be asked to increase their contribution by 1 per cent, against the acceptance by their employers of liability for any future deficiency on the account. These provisions are in line with theterms of the pensions scheme for other Local Authority employees.3. There was considerable opposition in the House of Commons to any increase in the teachers&apos; contribution above 5 per cent., but the present offer ismore generous than the last because the teachers&apos; 6 per cent, cannot be increased,and we think there is a chance the teachers will accept it. We ask for authorityto put the scheme to the teachers&apos; and local authorities&apos; associations.J. S.D. E.30th September, 1955.48826Printed for the Cabinet. September 1955
