secret.P.(55) COPY NO.14th 3syter:^,erT 1,55CABINETADMISSION OF NEW MEMBERS TO THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe admission of new members is effected by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly, on the recommendation of theSecurity Council, where a successful applicant needs to get sevenfavourable votes, including those of all the permanent members, who can therefore exercise a veto.2.     All the Western candidates have been repeatedly vetoed by theRussians, because the Russian candidates have failed to muster thenecessary seven votes in the Security Council.3.     Hitherto the Russians have sought to break the deadlock, whichdates from 1950, by proposing a limited package deal, viz. , the admissionof certain Western and Soviet candidates.    We have rejected such adeal as inconsistent with the Charter,4.     The Canadian Government have now requested the views of theUnited Kingdom, the United States and France, on a solution reportedto have been discussed between Mr. Nehru and Mr. Bulganin during-the former&apos;s recent visit to Moscow,    Mr. Nehru suggested, andMr. Bulganin apparently agreed, that all &quot;qualified States&quot; should be supported.    These were in their opinion:&apos;LaosLibyaNepalOuter MongoliaPortugalRoumaniabut not partitioned Korea or Vietnam until they have been reunified.(The question of Communist China was rightly regarded as an entirely separate issue, as the issue is one not of admission but of represent-ation).Albania FinlandAustria HungaryBulgaria Irish RepublicCambodia ItalyCeylon JapanJordan5.     The Canadian Government are disposed to favour a priorunderstsuading with the Soviet Government on the admission of theseventeen applicants listed above.    The Australian Government agree.
14th September, 1955.(i)   By providing for the admission of nearly allpossible applicants, except the divided states,it does not constitute a limited package deal.(ii)    It would break the deadlock, which is dis-creditable to the United Nations.(iii)    If we do nothing, the Soviet Union may ta.&apos;;ean inconvenient initiative with Asian support.It has the following disadvantages:-(i) We should have to accept Bulgaria, hungary and Roumania, despite their bad record inhuman rights matters, and Albania despite the Corfu case.(ii)    It is questionable whether Outer Mongoliacan be called a State, or can fulfil theobligations of the Charter.(iii)    The admission of all these new members would adversely affect the voting position of theColonial Powers.    But new members cannotbe excluded indefinitely and our present votingposition must deteriorate sooner or later.7.        There is also the question of Spain, whose entry is at jjresentspecifically barred by two General Assembly resolutions of 1946.    I donot see why we should raise this ourselves, although the Spaniardswill feel aggrieved.    They are no worse than the Outer Mongols.3.        If the proposed seventeen members are admitted, we shallhave to adopt a firmer line towards attempts by the United Nations to intervene in Colonial questions within our jurisdiction.    A large numberof the candidates are likely to vote against us on Colonial questions, and make it difficult if not impossible for us to block objectionable actionin the General Assembly.    This will mean that we may in future bemore frequently faced with the question of withdrawing from meetings at which we consider that the competence of the United Nations is beingexceeded,    (A policy foreseen in C. (52) 232 but not yet acted on).9.        I am sounding the United States and French Governments on theCanadian proposal that the three Western Powers should reach a priorunderstanding with the Soviet Government for support to be given tothe&apos; applicants listed in paragraph 4 above.    The matter is urgent, asit is likely to come up in the Security Council before 20th September.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,
