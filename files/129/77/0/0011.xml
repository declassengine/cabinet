SECRETCP. (55) 111 Copy No. 4 131 st August, 1955CABINETTHE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSome days ago I sent the memorandum below to the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer.At their suggestion, I am circulating it to my Cabinet colleagues.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,30th August, 1955.48660Printed for the Cabinet. August 1955
DIZZY WITH SUCCESSOur trouble is that there is too much money bidding for the labour available.This applies in the production both of capital goods and of consumption goods.The result is to push up the price of labour unduly. Employers cannot helpthemselves. The effect on discipline and output is bad. It is not so marked infactory production or repetition work (where the character of the plant sets thetempo) as in building, civil engineering, and the like, where each job is an individual and not a repetition task.2. I do not believe that the margin is very great. We are not 50 per cent,overloaded more like 5 per cent.-10 per cent.  But this makes all the difference.3. There are two ways of dealing with this situation. The first, (as in war,siege or socialism) is to restore physical controls, especially on imports, and regulateall production by a Government plan. We tried this in 1945-51 and, if we want it again, the Socialists had better do it. For they like it, since they really regardexpansion and increase in wealth as rather immoral. (Socialists are economicpuritans. It is part of their doctrine to use taxation as an economic instrumentto control inflation i.e., take much more in taxes than you need as revenue, inorder to cream off excessive purchasing power.)4. The second way (which as Conservatives we must adopt) is to use a variety of methods (recognising that growth is healthy in itself) calculated to preventrank and excessive expansion. All that is wrong to-day is that the pace is a bittoo hot.(i) Monetary. To reduce the-basis of credit, as the Chancellor is already doing. But theBank Rate could be increased, if not at once, at the right moment. Open marketoperations could be pressed further.(ii) Administration(a)&apos; Do not subsidise consumption, which is already too high (i.e., abolish the bread subsidy).(b) Do not prevent anybody producing capital goods with his own money (likebuilding a house) but do not subsidise such investment. (Cut off housing subsidy,except for slum clearance.)(c) Since Government financed or supported schemes of capital development,.especially in the fields of engineering, civil engineering, and construction, arealready pressing too heavily on an overloaded market,(i) postpone what will inevitably add to the jam (e.g., roads) and thus resultin further competitive bidding for labour;(ii) reduce and retard schemes, however desirable, which have the same effect(e.g., hospitals, public buildings, Government offices, and the like).Nationalised industries should be included in the scrutiny, especially asto their methods and designs which are usually wasteful.(iii) Defence(a) Consider seriously cutting service to 18 months. This could not beundertaken before the election, because the Socialists would merely have raised the bidding and promised 1 year. It may well be possible now.(b) Make a complete review of types of weapons and abandon those whichmay be obsolete or obsolescent, by land, sea and air in new conditions, (e.g., fighteraeroplanes, mine sweepers and other defensive weapons). Any reductions will give us men, for the workshops; metal; and factory space. (The mere fact that, at theend of your defence economies, the financial costs may be almost as high, must notdepress us unduly, so long as we obtain a real economy of effort, both of man and machine power, and of materials used.)
(iv) Fiscal(a) To encourage ProductionThis should be by reduction of taxation, not by increase.(i) Reduce or remit income tax on another range of income tax payers and raise earned income limits to encourage the managerial andentrepreneur class.(ii) Reduce purchase tax in order to lower cost of living on articles which areof general use.(b) To stimulate Saving(i) Increase  tax  on  distributed  profits reduce   (or   abolish)   tax   onundistributed profits.(ii) Consider all schemes for making saving more attractive, e.g., can thepublic be given an opportunity of subscribing to a loan with somespeculative or equity interest (e.g., for colonial development)? Or whatabout tax-free loans? Or increase in allowances for insurancepayments?(v) TariffsSince we have turned our back on controlling imports through physicalcontrols, can we do something through higher and even, in certain cases, prohibitivetariffs?  Now that quotas, &amp;c, are not respectable, must we not revert to tariffs?Exchange5. Convertibility is the logical end of our policy since 1951. I have never beenvery happy about it, because I have always had sneaking doubts about the whole&quot;free trade &quot; policy which we have followed. However, it has certainly worked out pretty well and I am not unduly alarmed by the inflationary situation. I believe it is marginal and can be checked by some, or all, of the means already described.But, with full employment and an expanding economy, there must be some &quot; give &quot;somewhere. In the years between the wars, we took it on the level of employment.We can&apos;t do that again, and survive politically. Our currency (having freedcommodity markets and decided to support transferable sterling) is virtuallyconvertible if you know how, and a lot of people do know how.6. Having done, or shown that we intend to do, some or all of the thingsset out in (i)-(v) above, we might well take the plunge. At present, we are inthe absurd position that no foreigner will buy sterling against his future commit -ments until he needs it, because of the fixed rate. Since he doubts whether we can maintain the $2 - 80 rate, he holds off. He can&apos;t lose by doing so, and he may gain.But do not devalue, to a fixed rate. You won&apos;t be able to hold it. Get some flexibility.H. M.21st August, 1955
