Lf6THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    70CP. (55) 13930th September, 1955CABINETAERIAL ADVERTISINGMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation have to make very soon a number of detailed and technical amendments to the Air Navigation Order, 195,4. I have in mind to take this opportunity todeal with aerial advertising, which I have discussed with representatives of thelocal authorities.2. The practice of aerial advertising appears to be increasing and I am convinced that it should be carefully regulated. It is at present carried out by only a few small aircraft operators, none of whom is solely dependent on it. It isimportant to deal with it now before it becomes more substantial.3. The most offensive form it takes is sky-shouting. This speaks for itself,and I am sure we should stop it. The local authorities agree with this.4. On other forms of aerial advertising (banner towing, illuminated signsand sky writing), I had contemplated simply taking power to prohibit them in individual areas, if requested to do so by the local authorities concerned. The localauthorities, however, stressed to me the importance on amenity grounds of keeping the skies free from advertisements and drew attention to the distracting effect of aerial advertising on road users. They therefore asked me to prohibit aerialadvertising generally, relaxations only being granted in exceptional circumstances and after consultation with the local authorities concerned. I am inclined to thinkthat this system of local relaxations would be easier to administer than a control by means of local prohibitions, and particularly in view of the comments of thelocal authorities I would propose to take powers accordingly.5. I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues to my taking powers whenamending the Air Navigation Order, 1954:  (i) to ban sky-shouting over the United Kingdom; and(ii) to make other forms of aerial advertising subject to my prior permission,which would in fact only be given after consultation with theappropriate local authorities.I should add that the proposed Article would extend only to operations carriedout for commercial purposes and so would not affect public use, e.g., for civil defence.6. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government are in agreement with the above.J. A. B-C.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,29th September, 1955.48827
