THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 115 COPY NO. 6 f2nd September, 1955CABINET.   Cyprus memorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs in his opening statement to the Conference on the eastern mediterranean and Cyprus, the Foreign Secretary indicated that we hopedthat the Conference would enable us to restore the process of constitutional progress in the Colony.    We must expect that at a later stage our delegationwill have to explain to the Conference the kind of Constitution we have inmind.2. It will be recalled that on the 26th July, 1954, the cabinet approved a recommendation that the 1948 offer of a constitution should be withdrawn and a more limited type of self-governing constitution beintroduced instead as soon as practicable (C.C.(54) 53rd Conclusions,Minute 5).    Accordingly my statement in the House of Commons on28th July, 1954, gave the broad outline of the Constitution then proposed as one which would provide for a legislature in which official and nominated members together would form a majority over elected members: someunofficial members of the legislature would be appointed to the ExecutiveCouncil to take charge of departments.    It became clear that a Constitutionof this limited character would attract no support in Cyprus and in his memorandum of 6th April (C(55) 92) the Colonial Secretary proposed tomodify this plan so as to provide for a majority of elected over nominatedand official members in the legislature.    The precise compositionsuggested was - 3 officials and 10 nominated unofficials, with 12 electedGreeks and 3 elected Turks.    In the Secretary of State&apos;s recommendations the proposal for placing more Cypriots on the Executive Council and givingsome (probably 3) the charge of executive departments remained.    all members of Executive Council would be styled Ministers,    The governor has confirmed that this plan would be acceptable to the Executive Council in cyprus,    The Cabinet decided to defer a decision on the proposals in theSecretary of State for the Colonies1 memorandum of 6th April,3. &apos;        One point on which the Colonial Secretary himself had not cometo a decision was whether or not there should be any attempt to restrictdiscussion of constitutional questions, and in particular self-determinationor Enosis, in the legislature.    When the Colonial Secretary visited Cyprusin July he discussed this in Executive Council, when the Greek Cypriotunofficial members and the (Greek) Attorney General all considered thatfor political reasons no ban on freedom of discussion should be imposed,while the Turkish Cypriot representative favoured prohibition of discussion in the earlier stages of the Constitution, saying that the position could be reviewed at a later date.
4. In discussion at the Ministerial Committee on Cyprus on17th August (GEN. 497/3rd Meeting, Minute 1), I outlined the constitutional proposals set out in paragraph 2 above in respect of which draftconstitutional instruments have been prepared.    In our discussion, however,the Foreign Secretary expressed doubt whether a balanced legislature ofthis type was likely to be acceptable to a population of European descent,and thought that a legislature of a more liberal character would berequired.    It was also suggested that it might be preferable to increasethe number of Cypriot Ministers with portfolios.5. It was felt too that in certain circumstances there might be considerable advantage from the point of view of tactics at the Conferenceif we could offer a more liberal Constitution, without proposing to go through any intermediate constitutional stage.    Thus, if the Conferencedid not break down at an early stage and there seemed to be a prospect ofan acceptable agreement, the chances of achieving this might be considerably improved by promising a fully liberal Constitution at the outset.    Equallyif the Conference seemed bound to fail, we should make a much bettershowing internationally if we had offered a really liberal Constitution.6. The Committee realised that this involved the risk of a communist majority and also of the appointment of some CommunistMinisters,    It seemed probable, however, that these risks would also be clear to the Ethnarchy, and that in view of this the Ethnarchy might decide to contest a number of seats which otherwise they would not do,7, I thought it desirable to consult both the Governor and theSecretary of State for the Colonies on the idea of offering a more liberalconstitution.    The Colonial Secretary, while recognizing that it wouldinvolve risks, was quite willing to have it fully examined,8. The Governor has made clear to me his view of the difficultyof making any constitution work in the absence of the acceptance in some form of the principle of self-determination.    Even if a formula to that end were to be agreed at the present conference he would favour a constitution along lines set out in paragraph 2 in this memorandum.    he believes that this offers a greater hope of keeping control of the situationin Cyprus after the Conference and that it would give us a greater freedomof manoeuvre as regards further constitutional steps and he considers thatit could be put to the Cypriots in favour of such a constitution that, althoughas regards the composition of the legislature it does not give such a largeelected majority, it does not impose a ban on discussion on the future status of the island as did the 1948 offer.9. Nevertheless, while the offer of a liberal constitution wouldcertainly carry with it a number of risks, these might be worth acceptingif they were the price of reaching agreement at the Conference as opposedto a breakdown with all the dangerous consequences which the Governorforesees.    In view, therefore, of the earlier discussion of the ministerial committee it may be useful for my colleagues to have a possible outline of such a liberal constitution, which is attached as an Appendix.    I havenot, of course, had the opportunity to show it to the Colonial secretary and no doubt the Cabinet will wish to have his further views on his return.H.H.Colonial Office, S.W.I.2nd September, 1955. .
%4OUTLINE OF A LIBERAL CONSTITUTION FOR CYPRUSA possible outline of a liberal constitution, drawing on the1948 offer, consideration of constitutional proposals for Cyprus in the last twelve months and recent constitutions elsewhere, is given below;Legislative Assembly(a) Composition.    There might be 25 elected members, of whomat least five would be representatives of the Turkish community,and three official members (Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary),    The Governor might havepower to nominate a limited number of representatives (sayup to four) to represent racial or other special interests,e.g. Maronites, etc.   A Speaker would be appointed by theGovernor to preside at Sittings of the Assembly,(b) Functions and Powers.    The Assembly would be able todiscuss and legislate on any matters subject to the followinglimitations(i)   Except with the recommendation or consent of theGovernor the Assembly shall not proceed on any bill or Motion relating to finance, salaries or conditions of service etc. of public officers,defence (including organisation, discipline and operational control of the police J and internal security) and external affairs,(ii)   The Governor will be required to reserve forHer Majesty^ assent any legislation which in hisopinion purports to revoke or amend any provision of the constitution or which is in any respect repugnant thereto or is harmful or unfair to a racial minority,(iii)   The Governor will have the usual reserve legislativepower.Council of Ministers   (Executive Council)The Council of Ministers might consist of the Governor as president, three ex-officio Ministers and six unofficial Ministers appointedby the Governor.    The ex-officio Ministers would be the Colonial Secretary,the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.    Of the six unofficialMinisters one would be called the &quot;Chief Minister&quot;.    He would either be chosen by the Assembly with the Governor&apos;s approval or appointed by theGovernor in his discretion.    Two at least of the six unofficial ministers would be Turkish Cypriots.    All departments of Government would fallunder the charge of either an ex-officio Minister or of an elected Minister.External affairs, defence and internal security would be under the chief secretary.    The unofficial Ministers would be elected members of theLegislative Assembly and apart from the Turks, who would be selected by
the Governor, those other than the Chief Minister would be appointed bythe Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister,    The Governor wouldbe required to consult and accept the advice of the Council on all matters,except external affairs, defence and internal security, subject to the usualexceptions of urgency, triviality etc.    He would have a reserved executive power to disregard the advice of the Council if he considered it necessaryin any particular case to do so in the interest of public faith, public order or good government, but this power would be exercisable (except in casesof urgency) only with the prior approval of a Secretary of State,
