CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. J 5CP. (55) 13730th September, 1955CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN ZANZIBARMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Zanzibar Protectorate, comprising the Islands of Zanzibar and Pemba,is a constitutional monarchy under His Highness the Sultan, who is advised onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government by the British Resident. The populationat the census of 1948 was approximately 265,000 made up as follows:  EuropeansArabsAsiansAfricansOthers30045,00016,000200,0003,500These proportions have not been substantially affected by population growth. Theprincipal organ of Government is the Executive Council presided over by HisHighness, consisting of the British Resident as Vice-President, the Heir Apparentand 7 others (officials). The Legislative Council consists of the British Resident as president, 9 officials and not more than 8 unofficial members, the members being appointed by His Highness on the advice of the British Resident. It has long been felt that a constitution of this kind is something of an anachronism.2. In 1953 the then British Resident submitted proposals for reform whichwould involve the establishment of a Privy Council presided over by His Highness.This would be divorced from the reformed Executive Council, which would infuture be presided over by the British Resident, with 7 official and 3 unofficial members nominated by His Highness on the advice of the British Resident. the unofficial members would normally be drawn from the unofficial members of theLegislative Council and would probably initially be one Arab, one African andone Asian. The Legislative Council would be remodelled to consist of the british resident as President, 13 official members and 12 representative membersnominated by His Highness on the advice of the British Resident. The represen-tative members nominated as members of Executive Council would be invited to sit on the Government side of the Legislative Council without being bound toaccept a Government whip. An official majority would persist on both executive and Legislative Councils. These proposals were approved by. my predecessor inOctober.1953, and in April 1954 the then British Resident stated that the agreementof His Highness the Sultan had been obtained and all the major politicalassociations had accepted the proposals,3. These proposals unfortunately had to be suspended in July 1954 whenthe leaders of the Arab Association withdrew their consent and instructed their members to resign from the Legislative Council. This action was in the natureof a protest against the successful prosecution by the Government of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Arab Association for publishing seditious articles in an Arabnewspaper. Later in the year the Executive Committee put forward a number ofpolitical demands as a condition of their resuming co-operation with theGovernment, which included the introduction of elections, a ministerial system and an unofficial majority in the Legislative Council.48825Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1955
Colonial Office, S.W. 1,29 th September, 1955.\4. Since his assumption of office at the end of 1954, the present british resident has patiently laboured to restore conditions in which the original proposals could be implemented with Arab agreement and has urged the ArabAssociation to resume co-operation with Government. He has succeeded in restoring some form of contact with the Arab Association and has explored theviews of the other communities. He has now concluded that the extreme demands&quot;of the Arab Association apart from being unacceptable in themselves commandonly partial popular support even in their own community, and that the original proposals for constitutional reform, which have not hitherto been publicly debated,should be made fully known to the rest of the people of Zanzibar who are becoming impatient of stagnation. He has, therefore, reached the conclusion thatthere should be no further delay in introducing the 1953 proposals, and anannouncement of the intention of the Government of Zanzibar to have anindependent inquiry into future methods of selecting the representative membersof Legislative Council.5. The Arab leaders have not accepted this and have demanded a full dressinquiry into the whole constitutional position, stating that if their demands are not met they will organise a deputation representing all the main communities to askme to appoint a Commission from outside to investigate all aspects of constitutional advance in Zanzibar. The British Resident has informed me of hisopinion that such a move on the part of the Executive Committee of the ArabAssociation would not find support outside one section of the Arab community.I have, therefore, agreed that he may issue in Zanzibar a communique outlining for public discussion his proposals, to which I refer above, and indicating his intentionto submit them to the Legislative Council for its early consideration. In this connexion an exchange of despatches between the Resident and myself analysingthe proposals in greater detail will be published and placed before the LegislativeCouncil. This action commands the full and willing consent of His Highness the sultan.6.   I circulate the above for the information of my colleagues.A. L-B.
