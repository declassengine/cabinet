Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1955SECRET - Copy No.   75CP. (55) 1477th October, 1955CABINETSPAINNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it will very shortly be necessary to decide whether or not to support theSpanish government&apos;s applications for membership of the United Nations and theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.). This raises thewhole question of Anglo-Spanish relations and is my motive for circulating theattached paper on the subject.2. For the reasons given in my paper I consider that Her Majesty?sGovernment should unequivocally support the Spanish candidature for both theUnited Nations and the O.E.E.C. In my opinion we should decide to do this onthe merits of each case and because our favourable vote for Spain&apos;s inclusion inthese two international bodies is essential for the improvement in Anglo-Spanishrelations, for which I am convinced we ought to work.3. Our relations with Spain are complicated by the Spanish attitude overGibraltar and the restrictions which the Spanish authorities have enforced since1954 on the Gibraltar frontier. An essential factor in a real improvement in anglo-Spanish relations must be the return by the Spanish Government to a more friendly attitude towards Gibraltar, with relaxation of the frontier controls. If theproposal to support Spain for the United Nations and O.E.E.C. is approved, Iwould propose to instruct Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid that when thetime comes to notify the Spanish Government of our favourable decisions he should at the same time emphasise to them that the success of Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s policy of trying to improve relations will depend on Spanish willingness to behavereasonably over Gibraltar. For the reasons given in my.attached paper I considerthat this procedure is preferable to an attempt to strike a bargain with the SpanishGovernment, which would almost certainly fail and to which there are in any caseserious objections.Foreign Office, S;W. 1,5ih October, 19,55.
ANGLO-SPANISH relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invite my colleagues to consider the question of our relations with Spain.2. British policy immediately after the War was to ostracise Franco, so faras our essential economic interests permitted, in the hope that he would removehimself or be removed from power. Thus we voted in favour of the 1946Resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which declared Spainunworthy of membership of the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies orof participation in United Nations activities while the present regime remained in power and recommended the withdrawal of Ambassadors from Madrid. Thispolicy was not a success and was recognised to have strengthened rather thanweakened the regime. It was tacitly abandoned in 1950 when the prohibition onmembership of the Specialised Agencies was rescinded and Ambassadors werereinstated. Nevertheless the critical comments on the regime and the bar onmembership of the United Nations have never been withdrawn.3. In November 1951 Sir Anthony Eden, as Foreign Secretary, announced inParliament that Her Majesty&apos;s Government desired &quot; correct and, I hope, friendly relations &quot; with Spain. Since then we have voted in favour of Spanish membership of a number of specialised and technical organisations. We have made availableto Spanish officers vacancies on technical non-secret military courses and havegiven limited facilities for Spanish experts to study our development of nuclear energy. We have removed the ban on the export of military equipment except the latest operational jet aircraft and similar &quot; classified &quot; arms. Naval visits to spanish ports, which were suspended in 1954 because of Spanish behaviour at thetime of The Queen&apos;s visit to Gibraltar, are shortly to be resumed. There is a small but useful cultural exchange between the two countries. In the economic field wemaintain good relations with Spain and have only this year lost first place toGermany as a buyer of Spanish goods. Despite these minor improvements,however, Anglo-Spanish relations remain unsatisfactory in important respects.Questions at Issue between the United Kingdom and Spain4.  Three only need be considered here.(if Our attitude to the Franco regime.(ii) Our attitude towards Spain&apos;s desire for re-instatement in internationalsociety, in particular Spain&apos;s candidature for international organisations.(iii) Gibraltar.The Regime5. Though mild compared with any Communist regime (including that of yugoslavia) the Franco regime remains authoritarian and antagonistic to parliamentary democracy. The press is not free (though no more controlled than,for instance, in Turkey). Though Franco is preparing the way for a restoration ofthe monarchy, this process has not so far entailed liberalisation of his own regime.6. Economically, the prospects of liberalisation may be rather better. Wemust not be too optimistic, but it seems unlikely that the Spanish Governmentwould have applied for full membership of O.E.E.C. if they were not prepared togo some distance, in their own time, towards conforming with O.E.E.C. practices.7. In the United Kingdom and Western Europe, particularly in the socialist parties and the trade unions, hostility to Franco&apos;s regime is still strong. It appearsnevertheless to be slowly diminishing, with the advent of a generation which didnot know the Spanish civil war, and with the increased contacts resulting from thehow very substantial tourist traffic.Spain&apos;s International Aspirations8. As hostility abroad has appeared to wane, Spain has progressively pressedher claim to be readmitted to international society. A point has now been reachedwhere Spain has been admitted to the majority of international technicalorganisations, as well as United Nations specialised agencies. Spain also hasobserver status at the United Nations, O.E.E.C. and the International Labour
Organisation. She is in addition a member of the O.E.E.C. Ministerial Committeefor Food and Agriculture and of the European Conference of Ministers ofTransport.9. The principal international bodies to which Spain is now seeking, or islikely to seek, admission are the United Nations, O.E.E.C., Council of europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).(a) United Nations10. Since the opening of the current session of the United Nations general assembly the Spanish Government has applied for United Nations membership.Spanish membership of the United Nations is still specifically barred by theunrevoked parts of the General Assembly&apos;s Resolutions of .1946 (cf. paragraph above). The Spanish Government however argue that this ban has been implicitlydropped.11. When the Cabinet considered CP. (55) 124 on the general subject of the admission of new members to the United Nations the question of Spanishmembership was raised, but no decision was taken (CM. (55) 31st Conclusions,Minute 7).12. The prospects of a &quot; package &quot; solution of the contested applicationsfor United Nations membership are obscure. But in any case sooner or later weshall have to take a position on the Spanish application. I consider that her majesty&apos;s Government should support it as the Americans certainly intend to do.Our failure to do so would certainly cause great bitterness in Spain and destroy the prospects.of improving Anglo-Spanish relations. Spanish membership wouldalso have certain specific advantages by increasing &quot; Western &quot; representation inthe United Nations. It is also a matter of common sense that Spain should hotbe excluded from an organisation which already includes Soviet satellites andfictitious entities in the Ukraine and White Russia, not to mention numerous smalland backward countries.13. It would presumably be necessary for the United Nations general assembly to revoke or annul in some way its 1946 decision against Spain. Thisdecision was based, broadly speaking, on the grounds that the Spanish Governmenthad been installed by the Axis powers and had shown by its association with themthat it was not qualified for United Nations membership. It could be argued that whereas immediately after the defeat of Germany, Spain was still heavily tainted by her association with the enemies of the United Nations, this no longer applied in the changed circumstances of to-day.(b) O.E.E.C.14. The Spanish Government wish to become a full member of O.E.E.CThey have indicated that they would be willing to have an O.E.E.C. Study Groupvisit Spain to assess Spain&apos;s fitness for membership.15. At the outset, Spain could not comply fully with O.E.E.C. practices,and her membership would therefore cause difficulties. But if in the long termSpain is prepared to liberalise her trade practices, it will probably be in the general interest of the O.E.E.C. countries to have her as a member. Some ultimatepolitical benefit may also be expected from the increased contacts with western europe which would result. I consider that there is a good case for supportingher candidature.(c) Council of Europe16.&apos; Spain has not applied for membership and until the existing rules for admission are relaxed the Spanish Government are unlikely to take the initiative in seeking membership. If they did we would have to frame our attitude afterconsultation with the other Governments. But if Yugoslavia were admitted wecould hardly fail to vote for Spain. Perhaps both might be given &quot;observer&quot;status. .(d) N.A.T.O.17. The Spanish Government have not asked to be admitted to N.A.T.O.They would certainly like to be invited to join, but are unlikely to canvass their claim publicly until they can be reasonably certain that it will be successful.
18. At the 1952 Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the PortugueseForeign Minister, in welcoming the Council, made a plea for Spanish membership of N.A.T.O. which was ignored by the Council. The Council has avoided theproblem ever since on the grounds that there would be strong opposition from certain members. There would certainly be political opposition in this countryand also in the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium and France. Spanish candidature(which requires unanimous support for success) could on the other hand findsupport from the United States and Portugal, and probably from Turkey, greece and Germany.19. There are also practical objections to the early admission of Spain.N.A.T.O. needs time to assimilate Germany into the Organisation before acceptingany more new members. Spanish membership might lead to diversion of UnitedStates funds and supplies from members who are nearer to the front line than isSpain. Any strategic advantage from Spain&apos;s admission would probably be smallsince the Spanish-American Agreement already gives N.A.T.O. most of what itneeds.20. The balance of advantage thus lies against any move to bring Spaininto N.A.T.O. at present.Gibraltar21. However friendly we show ourselves the Spanish Government will notnot abandon their claim to Gibraltar, which has been regularly repeated since1713 and which is generally supported by Spaniards irrespective of political belief.Franco hopes and expects that in time we shall agree to discuss the Spanish claim.The Simonstown agreement, and our invitation to the Greeks and Turks to discussCyprus, will have encouraged him to persevere.22. Serious friction over Gibraltar began last year when, at the time of the queen&apos;s visit to Gibraltar, the Spanish Government worked up a propaganda campaign and imposed various restrictions on the Gibraltar frontier. the propaganda campaign has in general been damped down, though there have beenrecrudescences such as the recent &quot; Gibraltar Exhibition&quot; in Madrid. Thefrontier restrictions have also been eased, though the most dangerous of them the Spanish refusal to issue new labour permits to Spanish nationals wishing to seek employment in Gibraltar remains and could over the years strangle theNaval Dockyard by denying Spanish labour.The Possibility of a Bargain23. If, as I suggest, it is now open to us to support Spain&apos;s candidature forthe United Nations and (subject to conditions) O.E.E.C., it may be argued that weshould seize the occasion to try to strike a bargain with Franco whereby, in returnfor our support, he would withdraw the remaining restrictions on the Gibraltarfrontier. But there are weighty objections to this, the most serious being thatFranco would interpret any British suggestion of a bargain as an indication thathis policy of pin-pricks and restrictions had succeeded in its aim of compelling usto discuss with him Gibraltar and its future. Thus the bargain would fail andif we then Opposed Spain at the United Nations and elsewhere, Franco would replyby increasing his campaign against Gibraltar so that our last state would be worse.An Alternative Approach24. I consider that we may do better simply to represent to the SpanishGovernment that our willingness to support them for the United Nations and other international organisations is an earnest of our desire for better relations; and to invite them to reciprocate. The best means of making our point might be toemphasise to the Spanish Government that our policy of improving relations must depend for its success on Spanish willingness to act reasonably over Gibraltar;and to suggest to them that they should re-examine Spanish restrictions on the gibraltar frontier. We are unlikely to get a positive response in the first instance.But there is some prospect that we could in due course work the Spaniards aroundto a modus vivendi at Gibraltar.25. It is for consideration whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government shouldvolunteer any public statement about their desire to improve relations with Spain.If we support Spain&apos;s admission to the United Nations and O.E.E.C., we shall inany case have to defend our action. I do not think we ought to make any special
statement until we know the Spanish Government^ reaction to our openingapproach and also the reactions here at home to our support of Spain for theUnited Nations.Conclusions and Recommendations26. (i) We should seek to bring about a progressive  and substantial improvement in our relations with Spain.(ii) For this purpose, we should support Spain&apos;s admission to (a) the  United  Nations   and   any  subsidiary  United  Nationsorganisations of which Spain is not already a member; and(b) O.E.E.C., provided Spain is able to satisfy the Organisation ofher willingness and ability to comply with O.E.E.C. practices.We should also consider sympathetically any eventual Spanishrequest for admission to the Council of Europe.(iii) We should inform the Spanish Government of the aim in (i) above andour intentions in (ii) (a) and (b), explaining that these decisions havebeen taken in the belief that the closer association of Spain with theeconomic and political life of the free world is desirable, and will lead to an improvement in Anglo-Spanish relations.(iv) We should &quot;add that while we are not seeking to make a bargain, theSpanish Government must understand that no policy designed toimprove Anglo-Spanish relations can succeed if abnormal restrictionscontinue to be exercised on the frontier between Gibraltar and Spain.We accordingly invite the Spanish Government to re-examine in a friendly spirit those of its regulations affecting Gibraltar which havebeen enforced since the beginning of 1954. We should make it clearthat we were not objecting to regulations aimed against the smugglingtraffic.(v) If the Spanish Government react favourably to this approach, we should invite Spanish suggestions for improving contacts, e.g., in the form ofexchanges of Ministerial visits. We should also renew our proposalfor the mutual abolition of visas, which Spain has hitherto rejected.(vi) If asked by the Spanish Government about our attitude to Spanishmembership of N.A.T.O., we should say that we understand thatSpain is not a candidate for admission; and that on practical groundsit would in our view be inopportune to raise the question now.(vii) We should tell the United States Government both of the general natureof our approach to the Spanish Government and in particular of theline taken about Spanish membership of N.A.T.O. We should ask the United States Government to urge the Spaniards in their own interests not to press any demand for admission to N.A.T.O. atpresent.
