TRADE AND PAYMENTS negotiations memorandum by the Minister of State, Board of TradeWith one exception I agree with the proposals in the reportby officials which the Chancellor of the Exchequer circulated (C.P.^55) 103 )0The exception concerns the assurance that we should give to the Japaneseabout the level of colonial imports from Japan,    In my view - and the same view has been expressed by the President of the Board of Trade - the under&quot;takings we can expect to get from Japan in relation to expenditure of sterling, non-discrimination and trade quotas do not justify a promise byus to allow an increase in colonial imports, particularly in the presentbalance of payments situation,    I, therefore, propose that our assurance to the Japanese in this connection should be confined to a statement thatthe Colonies will be free to import in 1956 up to the level of their 1955imports,2, The report of the Overseas Negotiations Committee proposes that we should give up our earlier hopes of securing an undertaking from japan not to discriminate against sterling imports, of securing adequateassurances that Japan&apos;s total expenditure on visible trade with the sterling area will be at least  210 millions next year and of securing comprehensivealterations in the Japanese import arrangements on oil.    In addition it isproposed that we for our part should give the Japanese, opportunity forsubstantially increased exports to the United Kingdom of canned salmon,provided we get payment   for   in worthwhile concessions to us,    I agreewith all these proposals, but they collectively represent a substantial retreatfrom our earlier stand,3, The sum total of the advantages we shall be seen to have securedfrom Japan in such an agreement will be as follows:&apos;&quot;(a) Some improved quotas for United Kingdom and colonialexports which will still be less than the value of japan&apos;s exports to these markets,(b) Certain relatively small increased payments to theUnited Kingdom for invisibles,(c) Removal of the discriminatory deposits which have tobe made by applicants for sterling import licences and the removal of one of the factors which operate against sterling oil,    (But in general we shall stillbe exposed to discrimination against the UnitedKingdom and other sterling area countries).
If6(d) A statement of intention (not an undertaking) that japan will spend what she earns in the sterling area,&quot;    This assurance was given in the existing agreement and experience has shown that it isnot of great value.(e) An undertaking by Japan to make a stated amountof sterling available for imports from the sterling area.All this does not amount to anything we could describe as an effectiveguarantee by Japan to increase imports from the sterling area to balanceincreased exports to the sterling area.    There is nothing there which would help us, when we are defending the Agreement in public, to justify anincrease in Japanese imports into the colonial territories.4, Increased imports of Japanese textiles into the Colonies have certainly hit Lancashire a serious blow.    This was one of the main points of criticism against the 1954 Agreement, which allowed for an annual increase of about  4 millions of Japanese textile imports into the Colonies,It would very much add to our difficulties with Lancashire now if we wereto make another Agreement with Japan further increasing these imports by about  7 millions.    In fact Lancashire is looking for a reduction in viewof the reported Japanese surplus in sterling.    We would need very strong arguments demonstrable from the Agreement itself to justify any increases in colonial imports of this kind;  and in my opinion those arguments are notthere,5, As such, the proposal to limit the Colonies1 imports is notopposed by the Committee,    The question is in what circumstances it wouldbe justified.    In their paragraph 8 the Committee recognise unanimouslythat we should be justified in asking the Colonies to.limit their imports from japan in present circumstances, if the Japanese were not willing to enterinto the specific commitments proposed, to which I have referred inparagraphs 2 and 3 above, and which I consider inadequate.    If, however  our negotiators were to find (unexpectedly) that the Japanese were prepared togive general assurances against discrimination, as we originally asked,then I agree it would be right to maintain our offer of free access to theI therefore hope my colleagues will agree  -that our negotiators should, immediatelynegotiations restart, make one final offer of free access to the Colonies in return foran undertaking by Japan not to discriminate against sterling area imports;that if j as we expect, this undertaking is not given, the Japanese should be told that wecannot undertake to allow the Colonies to importmore from Japan in 1956 than they importedin 1955;Skat in all other respects our negotiators a.ct as recommended in C0F0(55) 103,A0R,W0L,Board of Trade, S0Wvl,Colonies.6.(a)(b)(c)12th Augusts 1955,
