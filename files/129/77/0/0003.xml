1L&amp;JAPANTRADE AND PAYMENTS NEGOTIATIONSReport by the Overseas Negotiations CommitteeA United Kingdom Delegation, led by an Under Secretaryof the Board of Trade (Mr. A.E. Percival), opened negotiations in tokyo on 23rd June for a new agreement on trade and payments between japan and the Sterling Area.    These negotiations were adjourned atthe request of the United Kingdom Delegation, acting on Ministerialinstructions, on Tuesday, 2nd August, in order to enable the 3oard ofTrade and Treasury representatives to return to London to report andto seek fresh instructions.    This report describes the position reached and seeks the instructions of Ministers on the main issues outstanding.Japan&apos;s balance of payments with the Sterling Area2.        Hitherto our policy has been to conduct our commercial and financial arrangements with Japan in bilateral negotiation on thebasis of a broad balance of receipts and payments at the highest possible level.    But, in practice, this balance has been subject to widefluctuations.    In 1953, Japan was in heavy sterling deficit.     In thecourse of 1954 Japan went over into surplus and her sterling balancesbegan to rise steeply.    This caused anxiety and it was on this accountthat our negotiators were instructed inter alia &quot; to seek arrangements which will produce an increase in Japanese payments to the sterling area, sufficient to eliminate, or at least substantially to reduce, Japan&apos;sexpected surplus with the Sterling Area&quot;.    In 1955 current transactionshave so far been in balance(and japan s sterling balances are actuallyfalling and may continue to do so, but this is because Japan is repayingcredit).    We have no assurance that the present balance will bemaintained.    Indeed, Japan&apos;s receipts are expected to rise and it is vital to us to secure some corresponding increase in Japanese payments to the Sterling Area.Overall Sterling Commitment3.        Our objective under this head was to secure an assurance thatin the first year of the Agreement Japan would spend  210 millions in sterling on visible trade with the Sterling Area.    This, together with about  40 millions worth of invisible payments, would bring Japan*total sterling commitment up to about  250 millions , exclusive ofpayments made in sterling to non-sterling countries.    On this basiswe calculated that Japan&apos;s sterling payments and receipts would balance,or at least that the Japanese sterling surplus would not exceed, say,.  10- 20 millions in a full year.    Our intention was that any assuranceswe could secure in regard to the provision of sterling for imports shouldbe backed up by the removal of discrimination against sterling exports,and by such general assurances as we could obtain about the adoptionof proper commercial policies.The form of commitment required4.        Our negotiators  report that while Japan may well be willingin principle to reaffirm her readiness to spend as much sterling as she earns, it would be a major departure from existing practice for japan to commit herself to make sterling available for Sterling Areaimports up to a stated figure.    There are, besides the United Kingdom,
other Sterling Area countries, such as Australia, which discriminate against Jaxoan, and others again, like Pakistan, which drive hardbilateral bargains.    The Japanese are certain, therefore, to insist onsafeguarding words which will leave them free in their trade negotiations with other independent Sterling Area countries.    Subjectto this, our negotiators think it may be possible, though difficult, tosecure a specific commitment of the kind we require.    Such a commit-ment might take the form of an undertaking by Japan to make a sum ofthe order of  105 millions available for visible sterling trade in thewinter budget (in which the Japanese allocate the foreign exchange attheir disposal for meeting import requirements over the six months beginning 1st October); and to consult with us early in 1956 about the size of the following summer budget.5.        In this connection there are three desiderata which we shouldcontinue to press for  -(a) A general statement of intention by Japan to facilitateimports, visible and invisible, from the sterling area to the amount of Japan&apos;s total earnings fromthe Area.(b) A more specific commitment that Japan will make available for spending in the Sterling Area in thecoming year - preferably in the year beginningJuly, 1955, but failing that, October, 1955 - asmuch sterling as she has earned in the Sterling area in the preceding twelve months.(c) Finally, a concrete undertaking that the winter budgetwill provide not less than  105 millions for visiblesterling area imports, i. e. , excluding oil and importsfrom third (i. e. non-sterling) countries.Of these three desiderata, (a) should not present any major difficulty.The Japanese have already indicated that they do not intend to accumulatesterling from the Sterling Area in excess of their needsj  (they contend that their existing holdings of sterling are no more than a reasonableworking balance).    But (a) by itself is not enough.    It is therefore recommended that we should seek to translate this general statementof intention into concrete terms on the lines of (b) or (c) above.The price of agreement6.        Cur negotiators advise, however, that it will not be possibleto get the Japanese to accept a specific commitment about the amount of sterling they will make available for imports unless we tell them that -(i)    we intend, in default of such a commitment, to ask the Colonies to limit their imports from Japan; and(ii)    we are prepared, in return for such a commitment,to undertake for our part to allow the Colonies to import from Japan up to the amount of their statedrequirements.7.        Certain points of timing arise in connection with these assurancesAs regards (i), the latest time at which the Colonial territories could inpractice be asked to limit import licences for the first half of 1956 is
September, 1955.    As regards (ii), if it were decided to give an under-taking in respect of colonial imports in return for a Japanese commit-ment on the winter budget, it is proposed that the two undertakingsshould cover the same period, i. e. October 1955 to March 1956inclusive.    If, however, it were subsequently decided to cut backcolonial imports, the restrictions would not then become operativeuntil the second half of 1956.    If the Japanese assurance took the formof 5(b) above, both their assurance and ours would be subject to review in February 1956.8.       As regards (i), the Committee are agreed that, having regardto our worsening balance of payments position, we should be justifiedin asking the non-entrepot colonies to limit their imports from Japan,unless the Japanese were willing to enter into specific commitments of the kind in paragraph 5 above, since otherwise there is a riskof the Japanese continuing to accumulate sterling and increasing our balance of payments difficulties.9,       As regards (ii), the Committee are not agreed in the irrecommendation.    The majority, with the Board of Trade dissenting,feel that we should give the undertaking on (ii) in return for the Japanesecommitment, provided always that the agreement as a whole can beregarded as reasonably satisfactory.    Those who hold this view considerthat what would constitute an acceptable agreement must be a matter for judgment after the Japanese have declared their attitude to ourrequests and offers on the terms of the new approach,.   &quot;We should certainly expect some evidence that they were prepared to follow tradepolicies which would give opportunity to Sterling Area exporters to earn,the amount of sterling made available.  Such evidence would take tangibleform in assurances of removal of discriminatory practices and provisionof quotas in accordance with the objectives discussed in paragraphs 13 -17 below.    In the view of the majority of the Committee the decision whether to accept an agreement without resort to limitation of Japaneseimports into the Colonies would depend on the prospects (in the light ofthe undertakings received) of Japan accumulating sterling from hertrade with the Sterling Area to an extent which would represent a realthreat to sterling.The Board of Trade view10.      The Board of Trade dissent from the majority of the Committeein this matter.    They consider that the proposed Japanese commitments(at whatever the figures finally agreed) would be an inadequate guarantee that Japan would not continue to accumulate sterling.    They furtherconsider that the Japanese assurances on non-discrimination and on theUnited Kingdom quotas and other matters will not in any event showJapan to be responding adequately to her strong sterling position.The Board of Trade therefore, think that, having regard to our overallbalance of payments Ministers should decide forthwith that the non-entrepot Colonies should be asked to limit their licences for importsfrom Japan in 1956 to the amounts licensed in 1955, subject only tosome increase in the case of East Africa to take account of the greaterdegree of restriction maintained by East Africa in that year.Logically, this limitation should involve only a reduction of  14 millions in the estimate of Japan&apos;s earnings in 1956 and a corresponding reductionin the amount we should ask Japan to undertake to make available inthe winter budget.    No doubt the limitation would also have a chillingeffect on the negotiations generally and increase the difficulty of securingsome of the further concessions we wish to obtain from Japan; but the
Board of Trade feel strongly that an undertaking to permit increasedJapanese trade in the Colonies could be justified only by the mostdemonstrably concrete assurances, which in their view Japan is bothunable and unwilling to give, that she is going to increase her importsfrom the sterling area to the full extent of her earnings.The majority view11.       The rest of the Committee disagree with the Board of Tradeview for the following reasons:-(a) A restrictive agreement would be inconsistent with our general trade and financial policies.    Such an agree-ment may in the end prove to be necessary but shouldbe accepted only as a last resort.    We have not yet reached in negotiation the point of seeing that a restrictive agreement is the only alternative open tous,(b) Everything depends on how the Japanese carry out theagreement.    Even at a lower level of trade, we couldnot be sure that the Japanese would live up to theirassurances.    Indeed, since a restrictive agreement would probably be unpopular with the Japanese, theywould be the less inclined to implement it to our advantage.(c) To ask the Colonies to restrict imports from japan would be a serious step which should be taken only if -(i)   it were clearly necessary in the interestsof our balance of payments position;(ii)    it could be convincingly presented as suchto the Colonies.\These conditions would only be fulfilled if our negotia-tions with Japan had led to the conclusion that theJapanese behaviour in trade was such as to constitute a special threat to sterling.(d) Restrictions imposed for general balance of paymentsreasons would have to be lifted as soon as these reasons no longer applied; but once Ministers hadtaken restrictive measures they would be under strong political pressure to maintain them for protectionistreasons.The measures proposed by the Board of Trade would be in conflict with our general policies, might well give rise to political difficulties between the United Kingdom and the Colonies and shouldnot be decided upon at this stage of the negotiations.12.       Ministers are asked to decide between these conflicting points of view.
75 Trade ProvisionsN on-di s cr im ination13.      We set out to secure the removal of as many as possible ofJapanrs discriminatory practices against the sterling area.    TheJapanese have refused to give us any general assurances on the grounds that this is a matter for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) or a commercial treaty.    We are, however, pressing forassurances on two specific subjects where there has been flagrantdiscrimination - namely, encouragement of barter deals in oil andcollateral deposits on import licences,    (Here the deposits required are lower in the case of certain favoured countries such as Indonesia thanthey are in the case of sterling import licences, )Quotas14.       Japan has not yet offered concessions on United Kingdom exportssufficient to compensate for the continuation of the United Kingdom importquotas for Japanese cotton grey cloth, apparel, toys, pottery, etc. whichwere originally negotiated in January, 1954; at that time we gave Japanfavourable treatment because of her poor sterling position.    our delegation has striven to obtain offers from Japan in return for ouragreeing, on our part -(a) to maintain existing quotas;(b) to open new ones for some minor items; and(c) to increase the canned salmon quota from 2.2 millions (cost insurance iveightj^lui^) 3.3 millions (c.i.f.),15.      The Japanese have avoided making any offer on this basis.They have offered an ostensible increase of between  2 millions and 3 millions in quotas, provided we make substantial further concessionsincluding a large global quota for canned salmone    But our delegationbelieve that the Japanese can be brought to offer adequate quotasincorporating substantial new concessions in order both to compensateus fully for the maintenance of our 1954 United Kingdom concessionsand also in order to give us adequate counter concessions for a largeglobal quota for canned salmon.16,       The offer of a substantial increase in the quota for canned salmon is of major importance if we are to obtain a substantial improve-ment in the treatment of United Kingdom exports to Japan,    TheJapanese have asked for a global quota of  10 millions.    In the yearJuly, 1954 to June, 1955, United Kingdom import quotas for canned salmon were  2. 75 millions (c. i.f, ) for North America,  2,2 millions(c, i, f, ) for Japan and  1,1 millions (c, i, f,) for Russia.    The amountof imports of canned salmon from Russia is directly related to theamount of our exports to Russia of, e, g, herring, and for this reason the Russian quota should be kept out of any new global arrangement.It is suggested that, provided that really equivalent and worthwhilecounter concessions for United Kingdom trade can be obtained, our negotiators be authorised to offer the Japanese a global quota for
imports of canned salmon from North America and Japan of up to 9 millions (c. i.f.).    The Japanese would b&amp; prepared to pay more forsuch a quota than they would be for a quota of, say,  5. 5 millions (c.i, f.)for Japan only.    It would not, however, be possible to give Japan are served quota of  5,5 millions without increasing the North Americanquota to at least  3,5 millions.    It is most improbable that dollar imports in 1955/56 under such a global quota could exceed  3, 5 millions (c, i, f, )since we understand that the total North American supplies available forexport are of this order.    The Canadians (who have by far the majorinterest in the North American quota) would not be in any danger of losing all their exports to Japanese competitors since it is our intention that  1,375 millions of licences which are in the course of being issued for North American salmon only should in fact be issued and that these should count against the global quota; we think that with this advantagethe Canadians should obtain a reasonable share of the &quot;global&quot; imports.It is proposed to inform the Canadian Government in confidence of the global quota arrangement, if it is approved, before we become committed to it in our negotiations with Japan,17,       Ministers have agreed that we should be prepared as part of asatisfactory agreement to extent open general licence treatment to imports from Japan of a wide range of &quot;non-sensitive&quot; goodswe have already liberalised for Western Europe and similar areas.    the bargaining power of this concession is very limited and it is proposednot to offer it until a very late stage in the negotiations when it might bethe means of obtaining final concessions from Japan,Colonial quotas18,      As far as Colonial exports are concerned, the Japanese have accepted all that we have asked for, except in the case of purchases ofsalt on which our negotiators will continue to press.InvisiblesOil19.      We have not secured our main objective which was to persuade the Japanese to open the trade to free competition.    The Japaneseundoubtedly have real political difficulties over this and their present arrangements for allotting currency for oil - which were agreed with us in January, 1954 - do at least largely protect the United Kingdom oil companies from Japanese discrimination. -  On the other hand, the waythe Japanese seem to be operating these arrangements has laid us opento accusations of market sharing by the American companies; moreover,the United Kingdom companies are prevented from increasing their shareof the market as they might do under free competition.    The committee consider that we must continue to press the Japanese to alter theirsystem, but we may have to be content with assurances -(a) that the method of determining and allocatingquotas to oil importers shall be fair;(b) that within the limit of their quotas sterlingshall be freely allocated for purchases andfrom United Kingdoms-controlled companiesupon application by the importers.
Films20.Our main objectives on films were to secure -(i)the release of blocked earnings;(ii)increased remittances for filmearnings;(iii)increased quotas for British films.The Japanese have given us no encouragement.    On (i) they are negotiating with the Americans about the use of their blocked earnings and have indicated that it would therefore be difficult for them to release earnings in respect of British films.    On (ii) they have said that it would bedifficult even to continue the existing discrimination in favour of Britishfilms and they cannot do more.    On (iii) they have pointed out that,on thebasis of consumer preference, which is their normal criteria, UnitedKingdom films have been treated favourably.It is suggested that a reasonable concession on films, as animportant constituent of a satisfactory agreement, should be one of themain aims of our negotiators.Other Invisibles21,      Our negotiators were instructed to seek the fullest possiblefacilities for our invisible earnings (including oil and films) and inparticular to ask for a satisfactory and regular procedure for examiningapplications for remittances, so as to encourage British business totake a long-term interest in Japan.22.      So far the Japanese have indicated a willingness to embarktentatively on some measure of liberalising the control of remittancesof various kinds but have been reluctant to formulate any generalprocedure.    They have not made any concessions on passenger fares,insurance business, or tourist allowances.    They are apparentlydiscriminating against British banks in Japan.23,     A good deal of further discussion on these matters will benecessary and it will have to be done within the framework of thepayments talks, since we have insufficient bargaining power to obtainadequate concessions through the negotiations for a commercial treaty.Whilst, therefore, the Committee do not recommend that the refusal of concessions on these invisibles should be a breaking point theyconsider that we should continue to press the Japanese for betteroffers on remittances (including passenger fares and insurance) and for improved treatment of British banks.24.     It is not possible to put an exact figure on the cash value ofthese concessions though we would be content with an upper limit of 5 millions this year.    Invisibles (other than oil) constitute thelargest item in Japanese payments&quot; to the United Kingdom ( 18 millions in 1954).    Thus it is a major United Kingdom interest in any negotiationswith Japan to protect and develop this source of income.
34Shipping25.      The British shipowners have recently made strong representa-tions to the Minister of Transport that an agreement should not be concluded with Japan while the Japanese Government persist in theirpolicy of subsidising the uneconomic expansion of their merchantmarine.    This matter was raised at an early stage in the negotiations.It is being pursued separately through diplomatic channels, and it isnot intended to raise it again in the negotiations.ConclusionsOverall sterling commitments26.   Ministers are asked -(a) to decide whether, as the majority of Departmentsrecommend, a further effort should be made tosecure agreement on the lines outlined inparagraphs 4 and 5 with authority both to use the threat and give the assurance indicated inparagraph 6; or whether, as the Board of Tradethink, the non-entrepot Colonies should be askedforthwith to limit their licences for imports from japan for 1956 to the amounts licensed in 1955(subject only to some increase in the case of east Africa) and the consequences of this stepfor the level of trade with Japan should beaccepted.Trade provisions and invisible transactionsMinisters are further asked to agree -that we should accept that our negotiators are unlikely to obtain any general assurances on theremoval of discriminatory practices, but thatthey should press for assurances on the twomost flagrant practices in that field - oilbarter deals and collateral deposits on importlicences;that an agreement would not be acceptable unless it contained satisfactory quotas for UnitedKingdom exports and that to obtain these our negotiators should be authorised to offer, aspart of a generally satisfactory settlement, aglobal quota for imports of canned salmon of up to  9 millions (c. i. f. );that, on oil, our negotiators should press theJapanese to open the trade to free competition;that our negotiators should press strongly forsome concessions oh films; and(f) that our negotiators should strive for bettertreatment for our invisible trade in general.(b)(c)(d)(e)
