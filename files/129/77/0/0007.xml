4-13 aINSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OP DISARMAMENTGENERAL REMARKSNo control system can ever be a complete substitute for good faith.     Control is made necessary by the lack of mutualtrust but unless there is some goodwill the necessary conditions for disarmament do not exist.2.     The problems of inspection and concealment are of quite different orders of magnitude in the case of:-(a) nuclear weapons, of which only a few, borne bya few carriers, would be sufficient to imposean unacceptable military risk;   and(b) conventional weapons, of which large numbers are necessary to wage a global war.NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THEIR MEANS Off DELIVERYPast production and stocks3*     We are advised that it would be quite impossible todetect the clandestine retention by the Soviet Union of sufficient past production of materials to fabricate a numberof megaton weapons which may be as high as 50 and is certainlyas high as 10.     We believe that the retention of such aclandestine stock would give a quite unacceptable military riskif the Western nations had no nuclear weapons.Future productionk.     If all plants were operated throughout by an international authority we believe that future production could be controlledwith a very limited risk.     We consider, however, that it isquite unrealistic to assume that agreement can be reached onplacing all plants under an international authority, sincenuclear reactors will provide an increasing proportion of powerproduction in all countries, and whoever controls the powerproduction controls the country concerned.5.     Apart from international operation, we are advised thatno system of inspection could be devised which would guarantee to prevent the clandestine accumulation of enough material forthe Soviet Union to make about 10 ten-megaton weapons a year.Means of delivery6.     It has &quot;been suggested that if nuclear weapons cannot be eliminated, it might be possible to control the means ofdelivering them.     Existing methods of delivery are probablylimited to manned aircraft, but these do not necessarily have tobe very large to carry smaller megaton weapons from Soviet basesto the United Kingdom.     Large weapons of ten to twenty-megatonswould, no doubt, require large aircraft of which suitable typesexist already in the United Kingdom, United States and U.S.S.R.Ballistic rockets of sufficient range to reach the UnitedKingdom from Soviet bases and carrying megaton war heads may
well &quot;be available &quot;by i960 although the inter-continental&quot;ballistic rocket (i.e. U.S.3.R. to United States direct) willnot &quot;be ready until about 1965.     Supervision of the productionand of the launching sites of rockets might present difficulties:while supervision of test-firing and trials would &quot;becomparatively easy.     Since very few megaton weapons, ifproperly delivered against a country incapable of retaliatingin kinds would have a decisive result, fully effective controlof the methods of delivery would have to &quot;be ahle to account forevery flight (or proposed flight) of suitable aircraft and the location of every &quot;ballistic missile.     Such a level of control would demand almost complete integration of officers of control in the armed farces of all the countries concerned., and thisis impossible.7.     An alternative might he to prohibit all aircraft or rocketscapable of carrying nuclear weapons.     However, civil aircraft and rockets developed for peaceful purposes (e.g. investigation of &quot;outer space&quot;) might be adaptable to carry nuclear weaponsor varheads.     It may &quot;be possible to achieve a degree of controlover the means of delivery which would be acceptable if onlyconventional weapons were used, but it would not be possible to guarantee that a small number of aircraft or rockets were notretained.     For the reasons already given, even a smaller numberwould be an unacceptable risk.o.     Apart from aerial methods of delivery, the possibilityexists of clandestine delivery of megaton weapons by anapparently harmless merchant ship, or &quot;by a specially designed&quot;sneak&quot; naval craft.     It would be impossible to controlsuch attacks,S.     We conclude, that so far as nuclear weapons are concernedwe could not devise a system of inspection which (in the ahsenceof absolute good faith and if we had given up all our nuclear weapons), could give an acceptable degree of control.Partial Control Possibilities10.    But if it were decided that the &quot;nuclear&quot; powers should retain &quot;by agreement a sufficient nurober of megaton weapons andtheir means of delivery to constitute a valid deterrent against aggression, certain degrees of control can he suggested whichwould go some way towards reducing the risk in the ahsence of absolute good faith and which v/ould be a positive contributionto building up goodwill.,     A system of partial control whichwould give a reasonably satisfactory check on future productionv/ould be bjr means of an &quot;audit&quot; of fissile material in allplants.      (The word &quot;audit&quot; is used here in the sense of checkingthe production of materials and not in the sense of financial control).11.    Such a system would lie based on the fact that all existingplants in the United Kingdom and United States carry out a detailed &quot;audit&quot; of the flow of fissile material.     This is done for safety reasons;   failure to account for the whereaboutsof all nuclear material might result in a serious accidentinvolving the contamination of part of the plant and injury tothose working in it.     The Russians will be faced with the sameproblems and it is certain that they also must have some kind ofproduction control.     If all documents used by the &quot;auditors&quot; ofthe plants themselves were sent weekly (but not less frequently)to a control organ, we believe it could guarantee what use wasbeing made of fissile material within a margin of error of a fewper cent, which would still permit clandestine production of anumber of nuclear weapons.     The foundation of this belief isthat if the suspicion of the auditors were not to &quot;be aroused,the documents would be so numerous and would have to dovetail so
veil that, in practice, it would he impossible to forge them.If the documents given to the control organ were so inadequatethat the auditors felt the safety of the plant was endangered,they could point to this discrepancy and ask for an explanation.To ensure the greatest efficiency from this type of control,the control officers in charge of the audit should also have theright to make physical tests in the plants whenever they coulddemonstrate that the information supplied was contradictoryor inadequate for ensuring the safety of the plant.   For asystem of this sort a staff of about twenty inspectors, includingboth scientists and accountants, could cover each major plant.12,   Another more modest approach (which could not, of course,provide a degree of control comparable to that achieved throughauditing) would be to devise some mechanism by which inter-national confidence in the nuclear field may he built up.    its main feature might be some kind of &quot;bonded store&quot; into which asubstantial part of the existing stocks of fissile material andthe whole of the future production of each country would beplaced.     The object of this bonded store would be to providea method of acquiring information about a country&apos;s nuclearindustry without at the same time asking it to give upultimate control over any of its fissile material.     each country would store its stock on its own territory, and each country would have the right to,use any part of its stocks inthe store at any time.     If the idea of the bonded store isto be effective, however, the inspector in charge would have tobe given time to check that the material was required forpeaceful purposes.Undeclared plants13*    It is necessary also to consider the problem of undeclaredplants.     All plants for the production of fissile materialthat have so far been constructed have &quot;been fairly conspicuous,either because of their size, or because they produce radio-active effluent, or because they make large demands on thecountry&apos;s electric power resources.     It is unlikely, ifinspectors were given freedom of movement within a country, thatany plant producing fissile material on a significant scalecould escape detection, even in a country the size of the soviet union,Nuclear industries in other countrieslk*   The arguments above apply at present only to the UnitedKingdom, the United States and the U.S.S.R. - but they wouldalsw apply when other states develop nuclear industries.    It isdifficult to see that such states could be persuaded to accept any more extensive degree of international control than thethree Powers which at present produce nuclear weapons.     Theproblem is however one of the future rather than the presentbecause the only processing plants yet in operation are in theUnited States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.     Tomeet the dangers involved in the existence of fissile materialas distinct from nuclear industries in other countries (e.g0 inreactors), some system of supervision involving limitations on the degree of enrichment of nuclear material might be practical.     It might also be possible to apply some technicalsafeguards to the reactors to ensure that the fissile material was not secretly withdrawn.
15.   In the past it was hoped that fissile material could be&quot;denatured&quot; i.e. treated in such a way that the mixture was ofno use in nuclear weapons but was of use for power production.We are now advised that this cannot be relied upon as a systemof control,16.   Nor is there any hope of being able to control, with any degree of accuracy, the output of uranium and thorium oresnecessary for the production of fissile material.     Any such control would &quot;be impractical because it would involve so manystates which possess sources of raw material but no nuclearindustries.CONVENTIONAL ARMAMENTS AND ARMED FORGESCategories of Information Required17.   For an effective system of supervision States must at the outset provide extensive information - and must then keep it up to date - on the following subjects:(1)    overall armed forces, present levels of armaments,and all military installations, including all naval vessels and merchant vessels above an agreed speed and size which are already built, under construction,or about to be built, with dimension, displacement,horse power, speed, armaments, etc.;(2)    all plants capable of making explosives, propellantsand possiblj1- one or two particular chemical products;factories in which armaments (including aircraft)can be manufactured or assembled, or in which essentialcomponents can be manufactured, or which are readilycapable of future adaption to such purposes;certain aspects of the steel industry;(3) relevant Departmental estimates, supplemented bysupporting information indicating in more detailhow the figures had been arrived at.(Note:    The information for factories mentioned in (2)would be examined;    a very much smaller numberof factories would then be &quot;listed&quot; for systematicinspection.)Methods, of inspection of conventional armaments18.   Different   techniques and intensities of inspection are appropriate to the different categories listed in paragraph 20above.Inspection at Strategic. Points19*   Inspection posts at rail junctions, ports, highways and airfields, though not assisting disarmament, would be able to check effectively any large movements of men and armaments,   a relatively small number of control officers would be adequate to guarantee against any dangerous concentration of land orsea forces moving westwards from the Soviet Union.     Suchobservation posts would, however, provide no guarantee that a surprise aerial nuclear attack could not be launched against adisarmed West.
Photographic Reconnaissance20,   Use of photographic reconnaissance would be an invaluablebasis for the whole control system.     It would be speciallyuseful in checking undisclosed plants of all kinds and largeitems of equipment.     It is, moreover, relatively simple to carryout.     It is estimated, for example, that fifty Canberra-typeaircraft, based in the Soviet Union, could provide the necessarycover for that country, but a large processing and interpretingstaff would also be required.     About one year would be needed for the basic cover, but thereafter photographic reconnaissancewould become increasingly useful as experience grew.Inspection of Man-power and Warlike Stores21,   Periodical visits by inspecting teams to military units and establishments, (and the subsequent analysis of their reports by a central agency) would be a satisfactory means of checking armed forces and armaments against the State&apos;sdeclared order of battle and equipment rolls.     This work wouldnot require a large staff.     Units and establishments underinspection would be required to produce documents comparable toour arms and ammunition ledgers, account cardsp transfer andreceipt vouchers, pay rolls, ration returns etc.     The super-vision of reserve man-power strengths and para-militaryformations would be cone indirectly by checking the volume of equipment and armaments.Inspection of Conventional Armaments Production (including aircraft)22.    In general the field from which would be selected the&quot;listed&quot; factories mentioned in paragraph 20 above would haveto be limited to those which form an essential stage in production and which would be easy to inspect (such as assemblyplants for major armaments, explosives factories);    those makingmajor components (such as turret   for tanks, aero engines,guidance systems for guided weapons);    those which a re readilycapable of adaption to such purposes (such as civil aircraftassembly plants, tractor plants).23?   The &quot;listed&quot; factories would be required to submitperiodically fairly detailed returns covering, for instance,future production plans, contracts placed, labour employed,expenditure, materials used and physical output.     In a few cases resident inspeotora might have to be posted:   but in most cases periodic visits would be adequate02h.   Given that the necessary inspecting staff could be found,and co-operation on the part of the government concerned,  then it should be possible to supervise the production of conventionalweapons In most, if net all, of the &quot;listed&quot; f actoriesa     Thedifficulty of letection of clandestine production in factoriesnot listed would vary greatly - from those readily identifiablesuch as aircraft assembly and explosives production plants,to?at the ether extreme, plants producing certain electroniccomponents in which defection would be difficult,25,   The prevention of the building up of stocks of completedarmaments from fature production (additional to those issued to the services) would require follow-up action, eag. analysisby a central agency.
26.   The construction of both war ships and merchant ships is complex and costly, and successful&quot;inspection, provided itbegan at the design stage, should be possible.     Inspectorsshould have powers of access to shipyards and allied works at frequent intervals, although the same arrangement of an initialgeneral inspection followed by periodic visits could beapplied here as in armament industries,,    There would need to be close liaison with the department of the control organ super-vising armaments and engineeringa     As merchant ships over acertain speed and size have a potential war use, it would benecessary to inspect them on the same principle as civil aircraftMajor Contributing Industries27.   Control of the steel chemical and electronic industries(apart from those categories in paragraph 20 above), and ofother industries of importance in war, even if theoreticallydesirable on security grounds, appears to be unattainable.They are too closely connected with states&apos; legitimateindustrial activities.Budgetary Control 8.   Budgetary control of itself is not an effective instrument for the supervision of disarmament but the examination of budgetary figures by an international control organ could provide a valuable cross-check on the armed forces and con-vent ional armaments maintained by a state.     With such super-vision, it would be extremely difficult to cheat on a&apos; large scale.     As the system would not give precise results, it wouldhave little relevance in the nuclear field.29.   A system based on the audit of past expenditure would beperhaps as much as eighteen months out of date.     A systembased on budgetary commitments would be difficult to operate as these tend to cover periods of several years and are in anycase limited to certain types of expenditure.     The system would therefore have to be based on forecasts of expenditure.Under the United Kingdom system such forecasts are given inDepartmental estimates which cover any one year ahead.The control organ would thus   have to rely upon the publishedestimates, supplemented by   supporting information indicatingin more detail how the figures had been made up.     after examination by financial experts it would be necessary forinspectors with experience of economic statistics, plus somescientists, to compare the figures disclosed with the information about armed forces and armaments found by inspection on theground or from the air.CHEMICAL AMD BIOLOGICAL WEAPONSProduction30.   The materials, plant, and processes for war gases arein many cases similar to those employed in the manufacture of several important chemicals used commercially.     Some in factform the basis of modern Insecticides.     For safety the factories would usually be fairly isolated.     This is relativelysimple to arrange as the plant makes no special demands on power or communications.     The final products would probably bestored below ground and could be preserved for several years.
3*1 .   The materials involved in biological warfare would beproduced in plants closely resembling those used for commercialanti-biotics, e.g. penicillin,,     But, as with chemical weapons,one would expect the plants to be isolated.     Stocks need tobe stored under carefully controlled conditions and wouldprobably be kept below ground.     The material v/culd have a relatively short storage life.Inspection and control32.   Given qualified staff, suitable records, and freedom of access there should be no great difficulty in checking the type   and quantity of product of both chemical and biologicalweapons being made or stored at declared plants or stockpiles.It would probably be difficult to detect   undeclared plantsor s tockpiles.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME33*   We consider that whatever may be the merits of controllingand inspecting current levels of forces on current productionof armaments, no complete security in disarmament can beobtained without adequate knowledge of the defence research and development programmes.     It is these programmes whichmay conceivably lead to a scientific or technical advantage which, in the future, can unbalance the agreed military potentialswhatever that might be in terms of weapons and equipments now known to exist.3ko   The required knowledge at the research stage could onlybe obtained by participation of scientists, particularly atpolicy making level, in the defence scientific organisations,and a permissive clause for examination of any laboratory, orany expenditure, or any commercial contract, would b e essential.Such arrangements would have such f ar-reaching effects,particularly upon commercial technical advantages, that theywould not be acceptable to any highly industrialised country.However, although it is impossible to control laboratoryresearch,  any weapon requiring large-scale field trials shouldbe discoverable at that stage if the control systems recommended in this paper are in force.ORGANISATION Off THE CONTROL SYSTEMProblems of personnel and administration35.   In considering what&apos; systems of supervision might be appliedto each type of armament, w e reviewed past experiences of inter-national control.     We considered that the Allied Commissionsset up to control German demilitarisation after 19&quot;1 S and after&quot;19^5, the control system supervising the   Korean Armistice andthat supervising the s ettlement in Indo China were established in quite different circumstances tolhose in which a disarmamentcontrol organ would be established.     Nevertheless, we concludedfrom the experiences of these control organs that:(a) members of inspection teams working under any effective control organ must be impartial and mustnot be hamstrung by the veto power of any one oftheir members;(b) the disarmament control organ&apos;s staff should probablytherefore be international agents, operating under conditions yet to be^determined, rather thannational representatives.
(c)   the control organ must have the right to malce full use of the postal, telegraphic and transport system ofthe state which it is inspecting and must also possesssuitable transport of its own and a secure and independent communication channel.36.   We assumed that the control organ would be composed of a central authority with headquarters in all countries (or groups of small countries) which v/ould be linked to regional centreswith posts and roving teams attached to them as required.37.   We considered that serious difficulties would he encountered in recruiting adequate numbers of control agents of suitablequality.     This applies especially to scientists with thenecessary knowledge to make their work effective.     We must therefore seek to concentrate on methods of control whicheconomise on personnel while still retaining the necessary degreeof efficiency.Rights of the control organ38.   We considered that any control organ should have unrestrictedrights of freedom of movement by air, land and water to, from and within all states parties to the treaty.     The controlorgan&apos;s teams should have a right of access to all declaredinstallations and routine visits should normally take place atleast at a day&apos;s notice to enable documents and equipment to beready for inspection.     As for surprise visits, it is recognisedthat they might provoke much illwill and should therefore be strictly limited.     However, it is essential to reserve thecontrol organ1s right to make surprise visits at any time to anyof the declared installations in order to investigate suspiciousactivities.39.   In order to detect Illegal activities in undeclaredinstallations, it would also seem essential for the controlorgan to possess powers to inspect - under conditions yet to bedetermined - any establishment or installation in any territory of any state party to the treaty.     It must also have theright to use all necessary technical devices which may aidsupervision and detection.PROBLEMS OP INDUSTRIAL SECRECY AND DOMESTIC LEGISLATIONhO.    International inspection in shipyards and factories would raise many legal problems and delicate questions of patents and commercial secrecy.     The latter would become increasingly difficult of solution as inspection moved from the productioninto the research and development fields.     We did not have timeto go into these problems although they may in fact be a mostserious stumbling block to a system of control that demandsinspection of factory processes.conclusions+1.    Our conclusions are j-Nuclear Weapons(i)   We could not devise a system of inspection which, inthe absence of absolute good faith and if we our-selves had no nuclear weapons, could give an acceptable degree of control.(ii)    Complete nuclear disarmament would therefore be an .unacceptable risk.
43 X(lii)    If a level of nuclear armaments could be agreedinternationally, a system of plant productioncontrol and record checking could be devised whichwould limit the possible diversion of material fromfuture production to a few per cent of total production.     This might help to build up trust and goodwill but it would still permit clandestineproduction of a number of nuclear weapons.Conventional Armaments(iv)   A system of supervision and inspection cfconventional armaments and armed forces can be devised which, given reasonable goodwill, could give asatisfactory degree of control.(v)    Such a system would have to rely on&apos; a combination ofthe following methods of control:(1) photographic reconnaissance as a basis of thewhole system;(2) inspection and analysis of varying degrees ofintensity, of man-power levels, armaments and armament production;(3)    inspection at strategic points;(h)    budgetary control as a general cross check.General(vi)   In the absence of any scientific developments of revolutionary significance, the system of controldescribed above should remain effective for as far ahead as it is reasonable to look at present;    itshould indeed become more effective as goodwillgrows.(vii)    Control over research is impracticable but thedevelopment of all new weapons requiring large-scalefield trials could be checked through such asystem as is visualised above.(viii)   The effective working of any system cf supervisionwould depend on securing adequate numbers of trained and impartial personnel with adequate rightsof movement and access and on co-operation fromgovernments so that difficulties over industrialsecrecy etc., would not obstruct necessary inspection.
