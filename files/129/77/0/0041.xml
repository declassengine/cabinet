SECRETt-****** &quot;*C*-**&quot;.* 0-**r.w pfcn Wfca-*a-4--a*j1st October,, .19.5.5,LONDON TRAFFIC CONGESTION^ i PARK LANE scheme memorandum by the Minister ^of Works.In Cft?o(55) 140 the Minister of Transport proposes that theNew Park Lane scheme should go ahead as soon as possible,,COPY NO.CABINET2a     In paragraph 8 of his paper he suggests that theappearance and amenities of Hyde Park Corner might, with someredesigning, be positively improved by the scheme.    The RoyalFine Art Commission have   expressed the strongest oppositionto it.    When they were considering it they had before them myChief Architect&apos;s proposals for mitigating the damage andthese were much on the lines suggested in the Minister ofTransport1s paper03*     The Dscimus Burton screen is so familiar a part ofLondon that it would be a sad day if it had to be moved.?Nevertheless to move it might well prove the lesser evil andfor this reason I instructed my representatives on the working party of officials to ask that the implications of removalshould be examined.    In paragraph k of his paper the Ministerof Transport states that, while no traffic plan involving theremoval of the screen has been worked out, he believes thatsuch a plan would mean a greater loss of amenity than the oldscheme.h*      I cannot see how a firm opinion on the aesthetic con-sequences of removing the Decirnus Burton screen can be arrivedat unless a proper plan has been worked out.    Drawings by myarchitects suggest that much less damage might be done by removing the screen than by carrying out the old Boulevardscheme,    I also understand that some technical experts considerthat the removal of the screen would open up a new range of alternative schemes which might interfere less with amenities and might cost less.5*     The experts on the official committee considered that a proper examination of the new scheme involving the removal ofthe Decimus Burton screen might take several months,    I hopemy colleagues will agree to a proper examination being made.The existing scheme would involve permanent damage^    its adoption without the fullest examination of all possible alternatives could only be justified by absolute and immediatenecessity.    It may be worth recalling that the reason why my predecessor laid out Hamilton Gardens so splendidly was thatit was understood that the Boulevard scheme was a long wayahead, and as recently as 25th May. 195h, he had a letterfrom the then Minister of Transport; which said &apos; 1 cannot evensay that we shall be able to approve the (Boulevard) schemeinside the next ten years&apos;,N.B.Ministry of Works, S^E.1,1st October, 1955
