yCOPY NO.  6 1I submit below my proposals for lightening the burden of the housing subsidies and for reducing the total volume of house building.    Owing to theabsence abroad of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I have been unable toagree these proposals in detail with him.    However, they follow closelythose which I outlined to the Cabinet at its meeting on 5th September, andon which there appeared to be general agreement.2.        In our election manifesto, we undertook to maintain a high rate of house building and to concentrate especially on slum clearance and therelief of urban congestion.    A substantial subsidy should therefore continueto be paid in respect of houses built -(i)   for the re-housing, directly or indirectly, of slumdwellers;(ii)   in New Towns, or as part of expansion schemes under the Town Development Act to accommodateexcess population from overcrowded cities; andin approved cases, to accommodate workpeoplecoming into an area to meet the urgent needs ofindustry (e. g. coal mining).3.        For such houses I recommend an Exchequer subsidy of  24.This represents a slight increase of about  2 on the present exchequer subsidy ( 22 Is. Od.).    However, it falls short by nearly  11 of the amount which, under the existing practice, would be required from the exchequer to make good the increase in interest rates and other costs since thesubsidy was fixed a year ago.4.       . The subsidy on houses for other purposes should be abolishedaltogether as soon as possible: but it would be unwise to effect thisdrastic change all at once.    The first and immediate step should be to cut the subsidy on houses built for &quot;general needs&quot;.    I would like if possibleto reduce it from the present level of  22 to about  10.    However, if weare not to lose the essential co-operation of the Local Authorities, it maybe necessary to make some advance on this figure.    They have reactedmost strongly to the latest increase in the interest rates on public works loans, and when they learn that on top of that the Government are proposingdrastically to cut the subsidy, they will certainly protest violently.    Infact, they may adopt the attitude that they are not disposed to build any(iii)secret.P.(55) 12 C20th September, 1955CABINETHOUSING SUBSIDIESMemorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government
substantial number of houses with so low a subsidy.    I am meeting therepresentatives of the Local Authority Associations on 3rd October todiscuss the position, after which I will be better able to advise mycolleagues on this point.5.        Other housing subsidies (e.g. for flats) would be adjustedproportionately.6,        Most Local Authorities will probably decide to meet all or partof the cut in subsidy by raising rents.    I would propose to advise them tosx^read any such rent increases over all their houses, new and old, and toconsider adopting differential rent schemes, as has already been done byquite a number of Councils.7.        Local Authorities should be absolved of their statutory obligationto pay subsidy out of rates on any of their houses, old or new.    At thesame time they should be left free to do so to such extent as they may think fit.    This would give Local Authorities a further incentive to raiseCouncil house rents to something more nearly approaching what the tenants can afford to pay.8.        These new rates of subsidy would apply to any dwellings built inpursuance of tenders approved by a Local Authority after the date of theannouncement.    Subsidies payable in respect of houses previously&quot; approved would, of course, not be affected,9.        The existing system, under which the Government fixes the house-building programme of each Local Authority by the issue &quot;of housingallocations, should be brought to an end so that authorities would be free to build as many houses as they wish with subsidies at the revised rates.10.       Our aim should be to reduce progressively the number ofsubsidised houses completed by Local Authorities and New Towns inEngland and Wales down to (but not below) 120,000 a year, and the totalrate of completions in Great Britain down to (but not below) 270,000 a year.It is reasonable to expect that the reduction in the general needs subsidyand the &quot;credit squeeze&quot; will produce something approaching this result,though it is impossible to forecast with accuracy the precise effect of either of these measures.    The position should, therefore, be closelywatched.    If it should be found either that the rate of house building isstill too high, or that it is falling away too rapidly, further action mayhave to be considered.11.       If they are approved by the Cabinet, I would propose to announceto the House the changes proposed in paragraphs 2 to 9 above and to saythat a Bill to give effect to them will be introduced as soon as possible,I would not specify the precise figures for the new subsidy rates, pendingthe outcome of my meeting with the representatives of the LocalAuthorities on 3rd October.Conclusion12.      Accordingly, I ask my colleagues -(a)      to approve the proposals outlined in paragraphs 2to 10 above;
U\0(b) to agree that I should make a statement to the house on the lines indicated in paragraph 11;  and(c) to authorise the preparation of the necessary Bill,with a view to its early introduction.D.S.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, 3. W, 1.19th September, 1955.\
