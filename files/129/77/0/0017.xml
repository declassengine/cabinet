SECRETCP-. (550 117 COPY NOw .^rd September, 1955CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe attached paper is circulated as a draft of a Britishpaper to be tabled by me at the Tripartite Conference on theEastern Mediterranean and Cyprus during the course of next week,I have undertaken to make a proposal on Tuesday and it is myhope that the delegations would be prepared, after elucidationof its meaning, to take it back for consideration by theirrespective Governments.    I will try to explain orally the considerations which have led me to make this proposal0H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.,2nd September, 1955.CONFERENCE ON EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND CYPRUSProposals tabled by the British DelegationThe first stage of the Conference has shown that, despitecertain important differences of opinion, all three Delegationsare agreed upon the over-riding importance of maintaining theirfriendship and co-operation and the ties which bind them ip.alliance.   They are also agreed in recognizing the key strategic position of Cyprus and the vital contribution of the british military headquarters and base in the island to the maintenanceof peace and security in the areas of the Eastern mediterranean and the Middle East.   They also share the desire to further the welfare of the population of Cyprus, to put an end to the acts of violence which have recently been distrubing the community and to restore harmony between all sections of the population.
2,     The British Delegation are convinced therefore that their colleagues will agree that it would be unthinkable that thepresent Conference should end in a failure, which would run counter to their common objectives and impair their friendship and alliance, which all recognize as essential In the present state of world affairs.   Having made a careful analysis of therespective positions of the three Delegations as disclosed atthe Conference, the British Delegation wish to offer thefollowing observations and proposals as a basis for the commonunderstanding which they are confident it will be possible toreach30     It is clear that the problem of Cyprus can itself be broken down into the following two main questions:-(A) The introduction and operation of a new Constitutionleading as rapidly as possible to self-government by the Cypriot people, under the proper safeguardsand guarantees required by the international situation and the protection of minority communities.(B) The future international status of Cyprus, includingthe question of the exercise of self-determinationby the Cypriot people.km     With regard to the problems coming under head (A) above,the British Delegation believe that their colleagues share theopinion of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that an essential element in the restoration of harmony in Cyprus and in the future&apos;progress of the island must be a progressive advance towards self-government, with proper regard, for the rights and interestsof all parties.   The British Delegation are confident therefore that the way is open for the Conference to establish a large measure of agreement upon the necessary plans and procedures forattaining this end.   It is the responsibility of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to introduce the necessary constitutional measures,but in view of the close interest which the Governments of greece and Turkey naturally take in the welfare of the communities within Cyprus of Greek and Turkish language, theBritish Delegation wish to put before their colleagues thefollowing proposals and to discuss them with a view to reachingcommon agreement.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government would hope to obtainthe expressed approval of the Greek and Turkish Governments forthis programme, since it is evident that this would be of thegreatest importance in securing the full co-operation of the&apos;   Cypriot people..5.     The proposals of Her Majesty&apos;s Government are intended toset Cyprus upon the normal path of democratic development.   Tothis end Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose the introduction ofa new and liberal constitution leading to the fullest measureof internal self-government compatible with the strategic requirements of the present international situation.   Theconstitution would provide for an Assembly, with an electejdmajority, a proportionate quota of seats being reserved for theTurkish-speaking minority.   All Departments of the CyprusGovernment would be progressively transferred to CypriotMinisters, responsible to the Assembly, with the exception ofForeign Affairs, Defence and Public Security, which would be reserved to the Governor.   There would be proper safeguards forthe integrity and independence of the Public Service.   A^ partof the safeguards to be provided for the Turkish-speakingminority, a proportion of the Ministerial portfolios would be reserved for that community.   A Cypriot Chief Minister to headthe new Cypriot administration would be chosen by the Assemblywith the approval of the Governor.
66     Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose that a special TripartiteCommittee should &quot;be set up in London by the present Conference,and should be responsible to it in order to examine detailed proposals to be drawn up by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for new constitutional instruments for Cyprus.    It v/ould be the dutyof this Tripartite Committee to consider the necessary systemof guarantees for the minority communities in Cyprus.    TheCommittee might investigate any suggestions for the furtherbenefit of the Cypriot population from the point of view ofthe close links between Cyprus and the United Kingdom, greece and Turkey, for example, questions concerning the status and rights of Cypriot citizens within the other three countries,7.     A further subject which the Committee might consider isthe appointment and terms of reference of specialrepresentatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments to reside in Cyprus with special right of access to the Governor in orderto observe the application of the new constitutional arrange-ments.    These officials could also be given responsibility forthe administration of any cultural or other technical agree-raents which might be concluded between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Greek and Turkish Governments in relation to Cyprus,8,     After completing its initial tasks the TripartiteCommittee might be kept in being in order to receive reportsregarding the development of self-government in Cyprus, and toact as a centre for discussing problems or differences arisingout of self-government which it had not been possible to resolve locally in Cyprus.S*     With regard to the problems listed under head (B) above,a divergence of view is unfortunately apparent between thethree Delegations.    Briefly summarized, the position ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government is that, while determined to presson towards the establishment of internal self-government in cyprus, they cannot foresee [a time] when a change in thepresent sovereignty would be compatible with the requirementsof the international situation and British responsibilities for security in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle Bast,The Greek Government, while equally recognizing the desirabilityof self-government in Cyprus, call for the grant to the peopleof Cyprus - of the right to determine their future international status by a majority vote after a short period of years.    Fortheir part, the Turkish Government, while also accepting on certain conditions the establishment of self-government, are opposed to any change in the sovereignty of Cyprus, and consider that if British sovereignty were ever relinquishedthe island should revert to Turkey,10,    It is evident that these positions cannot at present be reconciled.    But the British Delegation feel strongly that this fact should not be allowed to create an open breach between thethree countries with very unfortunate and incalculableconsequences to their co-operation as friends and allies inall the many fields of common endeavour,    Nor should failure to settle this aspect of the problem at this time be allowedto destroy the wide measure of agreement established in regardto the other main problem of internal self-government.
11,    Gonseq.uen.tly the British Delegation propose that theConference should record that it is unable to agree upon theproblem cf the future international status of Cyprus, includingthe question of self-determination.    The Conference would atthe same time agree that each Government retains the position which it has taken up at the Conference and is in no way committed &quot;by the proceedings of the Conference to change its attitude.    It would in particular be expressly recognizedbetween the three parties that the fact of their co-operationover the introduction of self-government in no way invalidatedtheir respective attitudes over the question of sovereigntya12.   When the new constitution has come into working order in cyprus and substantial -orogress has been made towards self-government, lier Majesty1 s Government would be prepared to call the Conference together again for further deliberation.    Inthe meantime the Special Tripartite Committee proposed in &apos;connection with the programme of self-government will serve as a standing instrument of consultation &quot;between the threeallied Governments,h-
