Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1955CONFIDENTIALCP. (55) 13627th September, 1955CABINETRELATIONS WITH THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITYNote by the Postmaster GeneralFollowing the Cabinefs discussion of a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (55) 78) at their meeting of the 19th of July (CM. (55)24th Conclusions, Minute 4), I was invited:(i) to consider what arrangements should be made to ensure that applicationsby the Independent Television Authority or programme companies for Government facilities were dealt with in a uniform manner;(ii) subject to (i) to arrange for discussions to begin with the independent television Authority and the programme companies on the basis of cp. (55) 78; and(iii) to seek the Prime Ministers approval for the arrangements to be worked out at (i) and (ii) above, and to inform the Cabinet of the results.2. I circulate for the information of my colleagues an Appendix showingthe arrangements which were discussed with the Independent Television authority and the Central Office of Information, and which have now been approved bythe Prime Minister.3. The approved arrangements have been brought to the notice of all ChiefInformation Officers and Public Relations Officers, and the Independent television authority have informed the programme companies.C. H.General Post Office, E.C. 1, *26th September, 1955.APPENDIXThere have been discussions with the Independent Television Authority inwhich the Central Office of Information (C.O.I.) have participated. Thearrangements proposed are:  (a) Independent Television News FacilitiesRequests from I.T.N. for facilities will be treated in precisely the same way as similar requests from the B.B.C.(b) Independent Television News Press Notices, &amp;c.The CO.I. has already arranged for I.T.N. to receive all press notices, &amp;c,put out by its News Distribution Unit. All Government Departments havealso agreed to include them in any selective distribution of news, invitations,&amp;c, handled direct.Copy No.   g348803
(c) Programme Companies Facilities and MaterialA general directive has been issued to Chief Information Officers of departments asking them to help the I.T.A. news and programme companiesas far as possible with facilities for use in their programmes, subject to theconditions that the company requesting the facilities should:-(i) defray any additional expense incurred by the Department;(ii) undertake not to use any facilities otherwise than for the original purpose, unless specific agreement is first obtained from theDepartment;(iii) make the resulting film material available to the Government forlibrary use, if required, at reasonable rates to be agreed;(iv) ensure that any advertisements immediately before and after theprogramme are not inappropriate; and(v) agree, if it wants civil servants to appear in a programme, to approach the Department concerned and not individual civilservants, to take special care in the presentation of theprogramme and ensure that any such programme should notbe in any awkward or incongruous position vis-a-visadvertisements.There should be little difficulty in securing uniformity in the supply of Crowncopyright film or photographic material for programmes, as it is held largely by the C.O.I. Other Departments holding such material have been asked toadopt the same practice and make the same charges as the C.O.I.(d) Advertising Agents Facilities and Material.Very special safeguards will be necessary when Government departments are asked for facilities or material for use in T.V. advertisements. The C.O.I.is providing Crown copyright material from its libraries on request (atcommercial rates) if the responsible Department agrees and on condition thatthe Department must see and approve the finished film before it is used.It will be for individual Ministers to decide for themselves whether ornot to grant Departmental facilities Or material for making T.V. advertise-ments. Whenever the Minister responsible desires, the Postmaster General,would be glad to advise. At the outset, and until a body of experience has been built up, Ministers might wish to consult the Postmaster General on mostof the applications received. Arrangements are being made by the C.O.I.for Departments to be given information illustrating the need for uniformtreatment of applications relating to advertisements of the same or similarproducts.(e) Reciprocal ArrangementsApproaches by Government Departments to programme companies withsuggestions for the preparation of programmes on particular subjects or theirmention in programmes would be made informally and are therefore hardlysuitable for formal regulation.
