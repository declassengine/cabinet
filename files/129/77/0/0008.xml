(THIS DCCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 108 COPY NO. (p I24th August, 1955CABINETJAPAN; TRADE AND PAYMENTS negotiations memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in the Cabinet discussion on 15th August (C.M.(55) 28thConclusions, Minute 7) I think there may have been some misunder stand -ing of the present state of the negotiations and of our objectives,    I should therefore like to put before my colleagues the position as I see it.2, There was I think an impression that -(a) the negotiations have already been carried toa point where it is clear that the japanese are unwilling to conclude a satisfactory agreement;(b) the majority recommendation of officials inC.P,(55) 103 meant that we should be preparedto settle for much less than our original objectives,while at the same time allowing colonial importsof Japanese goods to continue unrestricted;(c) the proposal by the Minister of State, Board of Trade,in CP.(55) 104 to limit colonial imports wouldenable an agreement to be concluded which wouldinvolve a correspondingly lower level of trade on both sides but which in other respects would be no worse than if we did not restrict colonial imports.3, As for (a) above, the fact is that the Japanese have so far takenadvantage of the fact that our negotiators had insufficient bargaining power0If, however, the majority recommendation of officials is accepted, a new situation will be created, and the Japanese will be forced to reconsider their attitude to our requests when they see that we mean business.As for (b), the recommendation in C,P,(55) 103 does not, in my view, represent a significant reduction in our original demands.    In anycase there is no question of our negotiators bargaining away additionalcolonial imports or other concessions to Japan before Ministers have afurther opportunity to decide whether the terms on which the Japaneseeventually show themselves ready to conclude an agreement are accept-able.As for (c), Ministers decided in June (E.P.(55) 2nd Meeting,Item 2) that our negotiators should seek an agreement on trade at a high level, and the discussions have so far proceeded on this basis, including
S7-the assumption that, as part of a satisfactory agreement, the colonies would continue to import from Japan up to their stated requirements.If we now refuse to continue negotiations on that basis, the Japanese may feel that they have little or nothing more to lose, and our chances ofsecuring our objectives (other than quotas for which we pay with UnitedKingdom quotas) and of avoiding still worse discrimination against our interests would be greatly weakened,4. The question of restricting colonial imports must be considered in the light of our general economic policies and our responsibilities tothe Colonies,    In refusing G.A.T.T, relations with Japan we have declared our intention to maintain the established policy of using theperiodic trade and payments negotiations to work for the maintenance ofa high level of trade and to work towards the gradual removal of discrimination on both sides.    The Minister of State!s proposal that weshould offer Japan free access to the Colonies in return for an under-taking by Japan not to discriminate at all against Sterling Area imports would be to go further than the decision in June to seek the removal ofcertain specified discriminatory practices and is something which it isscarecely reasonable for us to demand from Japan, having regard to ourown refusal to grant non-discriminatory treatment to her.   As regardsour responsibilities to the Colonies, we have always recognised that itis difficult to ask them to restrict their imports, contrary to their own.wishes and interest, unless we could give them good reason on balance ofpayments grounds.    This general line is consistent with the statements by Treasury and Board of Trade Ministers in the debate on Japan in theHouse in January, 1954,    While I agree that we should be prepared to restrict colonial imports, if it becomes clear that Japanese behaviour in trade is such as to constitute a special threat to sterling (and to tell theJapanese so at once), I do not think that we have yet reached this point,or that a refusal by Japan of a general undertaking in regard to non-discrimination need by itself constitute such a threat.5. The final judgment would have to take account of the specificundertakings which the Japanese were prepared to offer&apos;and of the generalassessment by our negotiators of the Japanese readiness to carry throughthe policies implied in the bargain to be struck,    I will now restate the objectives set out in CfP.(55) 103, as follows;-(a) An undertaking with regard to sterling payments as proposed in CP,(55)103, But the Winter Budgetfigure of  105 millions should be broken down intocommodities and values in a way which would satisfy us that real opportunities existed for our trade.(b) A satisfactory agreement on United Kingdom quotas.I understand that in return for increased importfacilities for Japanese canned salmon the Board ofTrade consider that satisfactory United Kingdomquotas should be negotiable,(c) Import arrangements for oil which give our companiesadequate opportunities to maintain and increase theirsales of oil to Japan.(d) A definite move by Japan in the liberalisation ofinvisible payments to the Sterling Area, such asinsurances passenger fares, films, the remittance ofbusiness profits generally, and the treatment ofBritish banks in Japan.
(e) The removal of discrimination in regard to collateraldeposits on import licences.(The question of shipping is dealt with in a separatenote by the Foreign Secretary - C.P.(55) 109).6, These terms are broadly consistent with the originalinstructions which Ministers approved in June.    If negotiations on this basis were successfully concluded, I believe that we should have obtainedconsiderable advantages for British interests, and would have a reason-able case for explaining why we had not felt justified in asking the colonies to restrict their imports.    Any such agreement would be subject to review at the end of six months in the light of actual Japanese perform-ance during that period.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.19th August, 1955.
