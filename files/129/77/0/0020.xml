(55) 120 iUtcfs 2Mk ??&apos;September, 1955 ? ^^BSACEUR&apos;S ALERT MEASURESMemorandum by the Minister of Defence&quot; ^^BAt their meeting on 26th March, 1953, the Defence CommMee approved a ^^BH) procedure under which the two North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)Hvarning periods (Simple and Reinforced Alerts) could be called in the N.A.T.O.Hrea (D. (53) 5th Meeting, Minute 5).  This was subsequently^endorsed by the^^B    B^orth Atlantic Council. \\/f\2. Subsequently the Supreme Allied Commander hi Europe (SACEUR)Mssued detailed proposals for the preparations to be made in each of the aboveHvarning periods.  They are grouped under the following main headings*-^^B     I    ^ Administration and Personnel.(b) Communications and Electronics.I (c) Security.{d) Logistics.(e) Mobilisation. \ ??? j,^-;(/) Operations and Planning.^^B 3.  The preparations are of two kinds:- r^^B^^B ^ Measures which  SACEUR himself can carry&apos; ;6ht;   [For example,redeployment of units; evacuation of transportation from forward^^B areas; evacuation of dependants of members of; Allied Headquarters,(b) Measures which national authorities alone can take.  (For example, f^^BMobilisation; evacuation of Allied non-combatants, diversion of Alliedor friendly shipping from certain areas, &amp;c] P^^H^^B H&gt;ACEUR has asked national authorities to agree now that when an Alert isH;alled he is automatically authorised to implement the measures at (a) and thatHiational authorities will automatically put into force the measures under {b).^^B \ From the military point of view it is essential that as many as possible^^B H)( ^e measures should come into force automatically once an Alert is called.Mindeed SACEUR himself in a personal letter to the then Minister of DefenceHafl&amp;r this year strongly expressed his conviction-.-that^^ljthe,Alert measuresHnust be carried out immediately and simultaneously by t^ej countries concerned.B Ve should, therefore,&apos;do all we can to meet SACEUR&apos;s .wis^e^ii^y&apos;^ &quot;^ , f^^f5. On the other hand, there are three main difficulties in the1 way of achievingHi militarily ideal solution.  They are:- XJiil-^^&apos;&apos;W&apos;1   *-&gt;iUj^in-/c-     ,, j$j ... fl^^J(a) Political Implications ^^^MMinisters have already agreed (D. (53) 5th Meeting, Minute 5) thatsome of the Alert measures will of necessity have a certain amount of48731
i im n        , , j&amp;j^-, y\x M&apos;h^m^ mmmpublicity but that this will have to be accepted. Nevertheless a numberH ^-M^-W of the measures might5 if put into effect precipitately, aggravate anfl ^-W^-^Ly already delicate political situation. The timing of these must therefore!^-^L\ be given very careful consideration.(b) Constitutional ObstaclesSome of the measures, for example those designed to bring the!forces on the Continent up to war strength, require mobilisation and!^-^L\ despatch of forces overseas. These steps would have profound political!^-^L\ effects, and on these grounds alone it would be imprudent to guarantee!automatic fulfilment of SACEUR&apos;s requests. In addition, hbwe%Mapart from certain limited categories, none of the Reserve Forces canHat present be sent overseas without the issue of a Royal Proclamation.!Powers will also have to be taken to requisition shipping and aircraft! ^-^L\The Service Departments are considering what further steps can be Itaken to streamline the process of calling up reservists, but theirHrecommendations are not yet available and in the meantime we are!^-^L\ bound by existing constitutional processes.(c) Inability to Carry Out Measures CompletelySortie of the measures will require for their full implementation!V; resources in men and materials which will almost certainly not be!m^m\ uVT^i available. In these cases SACEUR must be warned that we can only!m^mt Siye Partial effect to his proposals.6. SACEUR&apos;s Alert measures have been examined by an InterdepartmentalH ^L^LAWorking Party who have recommended in detail the extent to which Her Majesty&apos;s!Government should undertake in advance of the outbreak of war to authorise theirHimplementation. Their report, with certain amendments, has been accepted by thelChiefs of Staff and by the Departments concerned. ^-^L\7. I do not think that I need trouble the Cabinet with all the details of this!very complex matter. There is in fact a very substantial measure of agreement with! ^-^L\SACEUR&apos;s proposals. There are, however, certain measures on which I think it!necessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reserve their position. These are:-! 1Simple Alert(a) Alerting (i.e., calling up) additional signal troops.(b) Bringing assigned forces (i.e., those on the Continent) to a war footing. ^^fl(c) Placing air defence systems on war footing.(d) Alerting (i.e., bringing to full war strength) certain non-assigned active units,!(e) Implementing war plans for logistic projects which are a national!responsibility. ^L^LA(/) Laying of naval minefields. ^L^LAiL.., J (g) Tightening control of the Iron Curtain in Germany.(h) Enforcing stay-at-home policy and control of refugees in Germany. ^-^L\Reinforced Alert ^-^L\(a) Assumption by SACEUR of full authority as Supreme Commander. ^L^LA(b) Control of air and water transport ^L^LAIn addition, it will have to be made clear that the extent to which we can carry out Icertain security measures in Germany and certainlogistic and operational measures Iis limited by the resources available and the state of our planning.8. I propose,-if the Cabinet agree, to inform SACEUR that we accept thel ^L^mAlert measures, in so far as they concern the United Kingdom Government,,subject Ito the above qualifications.     also propose to .assure SACEUR that even those!&apos;measures on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decision must be reserved will belgiven the most sympathetic consideration at the tirftW&quot; 0tis&apos;- W*? &apos; py0&amp; m^mMinistry of Defence, S.W. I, ^-^L\i 12th September, 1955. i
