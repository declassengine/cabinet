WitMALTAMemorandum by the Lord chancellor in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet at their meetingon 5th September, 1955 (CM.(55) 30th Conclusions, Minute 6) I submit areport by the Committee on Malta, of which I am the Chairman,Procedure2, In answering questions in the House of Con-Ergons, the PrimeMinister and the Colonial Secretary have made it clear that it will be forthe Conference to determine its own procedure, and we feel that the openingmeeting of the Conference should be attended by the United Kingdom membersonly in order to draw up rules of procedure.    This will have the advantageof making it clear that the representatives of the Maltese political partieswho are called into consultation will attend at the invitation of the Conference,and not by prescriptive right.    It should be possible to begin taking evidence from representatives of the Maltese political parties and other Maltesewitnesses on Wednesday, 21st September,3, We agree that it will be desirable for witnesses to submit writtenmemoranda before giving oral evidence, and I have communicated withMr, Atfclee and Mr, Clement Davies on the subject and have sent to them alist of suitable witnesses proposed by the Governor of Malta,    We feel thatit is important that witnesses should be heard separately and in confidence,and the leaders of the other parties agree that the verbatim transcript ofevidence should be treated as confidential, though without prejudice to its possible publication at a later stage,4. After hearing the main body of evidence in London and before reaching final conclusions, the Conference may well wish to pay a shortvisit or to send a delegation of its members to Malta.    We are agreedthat such a visit would be very desirable, both to avoid the criticism that decisions were taken without examining conditions on the spot, and also toenable evidence to be taken from approved Maltese witnesses, other thanthose of the main political parties, who for various reasons might be unwilling or unable to come to London to give evidence.    It would also enablethe Conference to meet the Governor,5, We are agreed that it will be necessary for evidence to be given on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and that this should be done by theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Financial Secretary, Treasury,appearing together.    This raises the question of the character of theevidence to be given.secret.F.(55) 12113th September, 1955CABINET
60 Obviously we must put before the Conference a statement of thepresent policy and commitments of Her Majesty&apos;s Government which arebriefly as follows -(a) It has been agreed that the present constitution in Malta requires revision.(b) The Prime Minister in his statement on 6th Julyannouncing the present Conference welcomed theinitiative taken by the Prime Minister of Maltain putting forward proposals for a closer association between Malta and the United Kingdom.(c) The objectives have been accepted of improving the living standards of the Maltese people by theimprovement of social services and by increasingthe opportunities for civil employment, and anundertaking has been given to contribute to thecost of the necessary capital works, and, in an interim period, to assist, as may prove necessary,in balancing Malta&apos;s Budget on recurrent account.The question, however, arises whether we should reach a conclusionbefore the Conference opens as to the desirability of Parliamentaryrepresentation for Malta.    On the one hand, it is felt that having convenedthe Conference we should not seek to influence it in any specific direction,and should only make up our minds on the merits of this proposal afterthe Conference has reported.    On the other hand, it would be desirable forme as Chairman of the Conference to know which way the Governmentwould wish the Conference to go.7. We have considered a Report by Officials which examinesfully the implications of Parliamentary representation for Malta andalternatives to it.    It is quite clear that there are substantial arguments against granting representation.    These may be summarised under thefollowing main heads:-(a) Division of Powers.    There is the question how legislative authority can be divided between Parliament and the malta Legislature (which already has self-government over a wide field) unless the Northern Ireland modelis followed and Parliament retains and on occasionsexercises over-riding legislative authority.    failing this the question would arise as to whether the judicaturewould have to adjudicate on the respective powers ofParliament and the Malta Legislature.    There is alsothe question how the authority of Parliament could bemade effective in Malta against the will of MaltaMinisters.(b) Financial Implications.     The Committee are agreedthat if Malta is given representation in Parliamentthere is a strong presumption that this will be takenboth here and in Malta as a commitment that Maltashould eventually have United Kingdom standards of social services and wages irrespective of her ability to pay for them.    On what is known at present, it
appears extremely unlikely that Malta could everpay herself for such services, however much is spent on development, and if she were guaranteedthem she might v/ell relax her own efforts to earn them.    The United Kingdom might eventually be saddled with an additional charge amounting tosome  10 millions a year or more.Repercussions elsewhere.    While it is not thought thatthere would be any pressure from other smallColonies for Parliamentary representation as such,there is no doubt that if it were known that theUnited Kingdom, had become committed to raiseMalta&apos;s standards of social services and wages to united Kingdom levels other Colonies would press for this too.    Much larger liabilities would thenarise.    Difficulties in the United -&quot;kingdom in regardto financial assistance for Scotland, Northern Irelandand Wales might v/ell be accentuated and the demandfor a separate Parliament for Wales and possibly also Scotland would be reinforced.Parliamentary.     There is the obvious risk that in times of narrow Government majorities the MalteseMembers would give their support to the Party whichpromised to do the most for Malta.Opinion in Malta is strongly divided on this question.Even if it were approved by a referendum, there mightlater be a Government in Malta which was opposed to parliamentary representation.Against those considerations have to be set the possibility that a striking gesture towards Malta at this juncture would change the wholepolitical and psychological atmosphere and remove the long-standing friction between Malta and the United Kingdom over defence arrangements in Malta.To rebuff the proposals on the other hand would increase the existingfriction and might stimulate united pressure from all parties for full independence,9. The majority of the Committee feel that a final decision shouldnot be reached until the Parliamentary Conference has reported, but I shouldbe glad to have guidance from the Cabinet on this question.    The committee recommend that an objective statement of the various considerations shouldbe put before the Conference in the form of a memorandum from her majesty^ Government, and I annex a draft of this memorandum, based onthe report of the Official Committee.K.House of Lords, S.W.I.12th September, 1955.(d)(e)
1DRAFTMEMORANDUM BY THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENTIMPLICATIONS OF CLOSER ASSOCIATION OF THEUNITED KINGDOM AND MALTAIntroductory1.     This memorandum describes the proposals of the two main political parties in Malta as to Malta1s future relationship with the United Kingdom, and sets out the considerations which,in the view of Her Majesty1a Government, have to be taken intoaccount in reaching a conclusion upon them.    The memorandum isbased on the proposals of the parties as they were expounded inthe course of the discussions with the.Secretary of State forthe Colonies which were held in London in June and July last.It may well be that in the light of these discussions, the two parties will put forward modified proposals at the present conference.PART ITHE background.     The basis of the present economic and constitutionalsituation of Malta is the Island&apos;s dependence on the UnitedKingdom arising out of its importance as a naval, military andair base.    On the economic side, a third of Malta&apos;s national income is derived directly from payments by the United KingdomService Departments, and a further part is indirectly soderived; 22 per cent of the working population is employed on or in connection &quot;with defence activities.    Over 90 per cent of Malta&apos;s imports are paid for by expenditure of United kingdon departments in Malta or direct financial aid from Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    On the political side, Malta&apos;s importance as abase means that decisions of vital importance to Malta are taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on considerations of strategy and foreign policy without the Maltese themselves having anycontrol over those decisions.    In these circumstances, the maltese are extremely conscious of their economic and politicaldependence on the United Kingdom and anxious not only that theUnited Kingdom should accept the fullest responsibility for the welfare of Malta and the development of its economy, but alsothat the Maltese themselves should have greater influence overdecisions which might affect their future.3.     Recent events have helped to strengthen these feelings.First, the growing political awareness of the Maltese over thepast few years, and especially since the introduction of the19h7 Constitution, have made Malta&apos;.s position in these respectsa key issue for the local parties.    Secondly, world events havemade the Maltese strongly aware of the precariousness of their position.    The Maltese feel that the atomic age, with the strategic revolution which it has brought in its train, mayrender Malta&apos;s position less important and at the same timemore vulnerable.    Moreover, the possibility of a relaxation in the cold war, with some degree of disarmament, has created a fear of further reductions in the size of United Kingdomestablishments in Malta.    With a population of 320,000 which,in spite of emigration, was rising at a rate of i per cent per annum   until this year, the Maltese inevitably seek some kind of assurances for the future welfare of their Island.
The Existing Constitution in Maltah.     The present constitution has operated since 1947 and is adyarcby under which Malta has full legislative andadministrative autonomy over her own affairs with the exceptionof &quot;reserved matters&quot;.   These matters are widely defined as&quot;Matters touching the public safety or defence of our dominionsand the general interest of our subjects not resident in malta&quot;.   Within this wide definition and without prejudice toit, defence, foreign affairs, telecommunications, nationality,coinage, control of aircraft, Immigration and passports andsome other less important matters are specified.   The Maltalegislature has power to amend the constitution except certain provisions, notably those relating to the reserved matters and the powers of the Governor which relate to them.   TheGovernor has executive and legislative power in regard to allreserved matters.   He must in general follow the advice of theExecutive Council composed of Maltese Ministers in regard toall non-reserved matters, but he has the power to disregardtheir advice if he sees sufficient reason to do so.   He must also consult a Nominated Council consisting of the three service Chiefs in Malta and two official members in regard to matters in the reserved field, though he is not bound tofollow the advice of this Council.   There is provision in theConstitution for joint meetings of the two Councils under the title of the Privy Council, but this has seldom been used.5.     Successive Governors have tried to obtain the co-operationof Maltese Governments by giving them advance information ofany important measures which it was proposed to take in the reserved field, but this has not prevented considerable friction between the two halves of the administration.   Cases have arisen in which the Maltese Ministers have objected to acts of theGovernmenfc - in reserved field on the ground that they areoffensive to Maltese sentiment or contrary to Maltese interests.There have been disputes as to the precise limits of the reserved field and how far it is within the authority of theGovernor to order acts to be done in what normally would be thenon-reserved field on the ground that they are required for reasons of Imperial defence.   In some cases Ministers have declined to take action in the non-reserved field required forthe implementation of decisions taken in the reserved field,or have tried to secure financial concessions in return.Disagreements have also arisen about the exemption of service personnel and activities from Maltese taxation, and about thepayments which are due from the Services in Malta for publicutility services.   Some of these disputes have been of a pettynature but they are accentuated by the conviction of the maltese that their status is inferior and that they ought tohave a greater opportunity to influence both policy and administration in the reserved field.The Present Policy of the United Kingdom6.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government are advised that Malta is, andis likely to remain, an essential base, both for United Kingdomand N.A.T.O, Forces.7.     The United Kingdom Government rejected in 1953 the proposalsof Dr. Borg Olivier&apos;s Government for dominion status, transferof conduct of Maltese relations with Her Majesty&apos;s Government tothe Commonwealth Relations Office, and payment for defence facilities.   Instead the &quot;Home Office offer&quot; was made, whichenvisaged the transfer of Maltese affairs to the Home Office,as a mark of its unique situation but with no immediate changein the present constitutional relationship.   This proposals wasnot accepted, and can now be regarded as withdrawn.   Therefollowed the Mlntoff proposals for &quot;integration&quot; and thediscussions between the Secretary of State forthe Colonies and the leaders of the Maltese parties
in June last,    During these discussions it was again made clear by the Secretary of State that the Malta nationalist party&apos;s proposals for dominion status and transfer to theCommonwealth Relations Office were not acceptable.    The Secretaryof State however agreed that it was necessary that the existing constitution should be revised.   During these discussions thePrime Minister announced the intention to hold an all-party conference, and in doing so he welcomed the initiative takenby Mr. Mintoff in putting forward proposals&apos;for closer association.    On the economic side, the two MalteseDelegations joined with the Secretary of State for theColonies in issuing at the conclusion of the talks an agreed statement (text in Annex II) which said that all parties to theConference &quot;agreed that the social and economic development of malta is a necessity and calls for a joint and sustained effort by both countries&quot;.    The statement endorsed as objectives the raising of the standard of social services, the increasing of opportunities for employment outside Service Establishments andavoiding unemployment, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreed toprovide financial help for these purposes as necessary.PART IIPROPOSALS OF THE MALTA POLITICAL PARTIESA.     The Malta Nationalist Party&apos;s proposals.     Until recently the programme of the Malta nationalist party, led by Dr. Borg Olivier,  (which gained hO per cent ofthe votes at the last Maltese general election and is theonly Opposition party in the Legislative Assembly) was a claim for &quot;Dominion Status&quot;, coupled with a payment by Her majesty&apos;s government for the use of Maltese land and facilities for defence purposes,9.      In the talks with the Maltese leaders this summer,Dr. Borg Olivier put forward alternative proposals which he maintained provided &quot;a status which will give Malta full responsibility within the Commonwealth of Nations yet modifiesher aspirations to be a full member of the Commonwealth&quot;.These proposals were put forward in a memorandum (text in annex III).    The main features may be summarised as follows:-(a) Malta should be an autonomous unit in relation tothe United Kingdom within the framework of theCommonwealth.(b) Respbnsibility for Maltese affairs should be&apos;transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office,reorganised   if necessary, to deal with the affairs of Malta, and of any other territories which might attain a similar position, as distinct from the affairs of full Members.(c) There should be a defence agreement and an external affairs agreement with the United Kingdom,   Thefirst (based on the Defence Agreement withtheGovernment of Ceylon) would provide that theUnited Kingdom might base such forces in Malta as were required, and maintain such installations as were mutually agreed.    The second would provide that Malta&apos;s direct relations with the independent commonwealth and foreign States would be handled by the United Kingdom and Malta jointly.    Malta would be represented by a High Commissioner inLondon, and the United Kingdom by a High commissioner in Valetta.   In place of the Governor   there would&quot;be a Governor-General.
12^(d)   Although the Malta Nationalist Party maintain thatMalta has a juridical case for financial recompensefor the use of land and facilities by the service departments, they would now be content if, inaccordance with a series of mutually agreeddevelopment plans, Her Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to provide whatever assistance is needed to raiseMalta&apos;s living standards to the level of those ofthe United Kingdom.The Malta Nationalist Party are strongly opposed torepresentation at Westminster and integration.    They may wellthink in the light of the July statement referred to inparagraph 6 above, that they can have all the economic benefits of integration without the political disadvantages, and thattheir constitutional proposals, which they admit are primarilybased on considerations of prestige, are an alternative formof closer association.10.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government find difficulty in regarding theproposed arrangements as a form of closer association.   Apart fromthe objection that the proposals may be regarded as an approach to Commonwealth status through the hack door, they see a numberof practical difficulties in them.11.    The crux of the Nationalist Party&apos;e proposals lies inthe idea of complete local autonomy modified &quot;by the twoagreements for mutual assistance in defence and partnership inthe conduct of external affairs.    As regards Foreign Affairs oneor other Government must be responsible internationally for the affairs of Malta, and it is difficult to see how joint responsi-bility could he established or worked.    The defence agreement isof a type which has only been concluded with independent Membersof the Commonwealth or foreign countries in circumstances very different from those which exist in Malta.    Such an arrangement would not provide the necessary powers in respect of defence matters and would increase the occasions for friction with the maltese on defence matters.    The suggestion which the MaltaNationalist Party put forward in discussion   that suchdisagreements could be solved by the arbitration of a commonwealth Prime Minister or his deputy does not offer asolution.B.      The Malta Labour Party&apos;s Proposals12.    At the talks in June, Mr. Mintoff tabled an Aide-Memoire(text at Annex IV) setting out his proposals.    This has net been published or seen by the other Malta parties.    He supplementedand modified these proposals in certain important respects in subsequent discussions, although some important obscuritiesremain.    He made it clear, however, that, if his main proposals were accepted in principle, he was ready for &quot;negotiation&quot; ondetails.    His proposals on the economic side are moreover,&apos;largely based on the interim advice of Dr. Balogh andMr. Dudley Seers who at his request are completing their survey of Malta&apos;s economic resources and potential,13o   Although Mr. Mintoff*s policy is generally known as&quot;integration&quot;, it is clear that this term is misleading, andthat Mr. Mintoff does not propose the incorporation of Maltain the United Kingdom, but only a relationship which, incertain important respects, would not even be as close asthat between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Ik, The two main proposals which Mr, Mintoff wants Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to accept at once in principle are:-(a) that there should be representation of Malta in theUnited Kingdom Parliament by at least three Members,beginning after the next  United Kingdom election;(b) that Malta should have parity in wages, social services and direct taxation with the United Kingdom,This v/ould, however, be implemented only graduallyin step with a programme of intensive economic development over an interim period of fifteen to twenty years.    The United Kingdom Government wouldhave to provide substantial assistance during thisperiod, and a fixed contribution to Malta revenuesthereafter,15*    The main constitutional and administrative implications of the acceptance of these two proposals as proposed byMr, Mintoff are as follows(a) As soon as Malta is represented in Parliament,Parliament would have exclusive powers of legislation in respect of Foreign Affairs and Defence, and the&quot;imperial branch&quot; in Malta would become a directagency of the United Kingdom Government,    Parliamentv/ould assume exclusive power in the field of direct taxation at the end of the interim period, i,e,  infifteen to twenty years&apos; time,(b) During this interim period there should be -(i)    a committee in Malta representative of thetwo Governments, under the Maltese Ministerof Finance, to decide on the rate of progress in raising taxes, wages, and social service benefits towards UnitedKingdom levels;(ii)    a Ministerial Committee in London preside over by a Cabinet Minister and &quot;possessingexecutive powers&quot;, which would supervise the economic plans, and measures tomaintain full employment.    It should alsobe a means of consultation on the effects of the level of Service expenditure on Malta&apos;s economy.16,    There are, however, notable obscurities in Mr, Mintoff&apos;sproposals.   While he clearly envisages that formal dyarchy willend when Malta receives representation in Parliament and that thereafter Foreign Affairs and Defence will be &quot;within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United Kingdom Parliament&quot;, he does not indicate clearly how executive powers would be exertedin Malta in respect of these matters.    It is not clear whetherthe Governor of Malta, in addition to being the constitutionalhead of the Maltese Government, would also be the head of an&quot;Imperial branch&quot; with executive functions of its owncomparable to those of the present Maltese Imperial Government,or v/hether the Imperial branch would be a mere local agency ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government.    It is also not clear whether theproposed Consultative committees in Malta and London or someother form of consultative machinery would be continued afterthe end of the transitional period of fifteen to twenty years.
HePART IIICLOSER ASSOCIATION17*   The root political problem in Malta arises from the divisionof authority.    On the one hand Her Majesty1s government&apos;s defence requirements are so important that they cannot relinquish their authority in this field or in the related field of external affairs.    On the other hand the United Kingdom has, in accordancewith   Its declared colonial policy, given Malta a large measureof self-government.    At the June discussions, the Secretary ofState for the Colonies recognised that the present constitutional arrangements required revision, and welcomed proposals for closer association as a means for resolving the existing difficulties.18,   The main foreign examples of close association betweenMetropolitan and dependent states are briefly surveyed in annex V.   They do not offer any close parallel to the circum-stances of Malta&apos;s case.   Before examining the implications ofParliamentary Representation for Malta, as proposed by the MaltaLabour Party, it is desirable to assess the possibilities of closer association based on modifications to the existing constitution, but without full representation in Parliament.A.      CLOSER ASSOCIATION WITHOUT PULL REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT19o   The existing Constitution does not provide effective machinery for consultation with the Maltese on reserved matters.There is obviously a need for such machinery.    Although theGovernor of Malta has under the Constitution full legal powersto take any measures necessary for the purposes of defence andforeign affairs, in practice his ability to use them is sometimesdependent upon the assent of the Maltese Ministers,   At the sametime, the Maltese Ministers are acutely conscious that certainactions of Her Majestyfs Government in foreign affairs and defence matters affect them closely, and feel that they ought tohave regular means of access to United Kingdom Ministers   and opportunity to make&apos; their views known before such decisions are taken.   For example, the adherence of Her Majestyfs Governmentto N.A.T.O.  has resulted in the setting up of a N.A.T. 0.  head-quarters in Malta and a request for customs privileges for N.A,T.O.staff: the United kingdom&apos;s commitments to other countries inregard to control of strategic exports to the Soviet bloc,resulted in Malta being asked to impose restrictions on transittrade; a decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reduce theamount of naval work done in Malta dockyard could createemployment problems in Malta,    The belief of Malta ministers that their interests in such matters are not sufficiently takeninto   account reacts upon their own attitude towards measureswhich are required to be taken for defence purposes in Maltaitself.20,    To meet this situation it would be possible to set upadministrative arrangements for consultation on the following lines:-(a)   There should be a Ministerial Committee in Londonpresided over by a Secretary of State, with twoMaltese Ministers and two United Kingdom Ministers,A representative of the Imperial Branch in Malta would attend as ah aavl&amp;er.    This body would meet at regular intervals, say three times a year, to discuss matters of common interest, though it could of course
12,2.hold ad hoc meetings at any time if matters ofspecial importance to Malta arose,,    A principalfunction of this Committee would he to give the maltese a general survey of United Kingdom foreignaffairs and defence policy, especially any aspectsof it which are likely to affect Malta itself.    Itwould also he open to the Maltese to raise any matters either in regard to&apos;foreign affairs and defence and related matters, or in regard to continue and financial matters and United Kingdomassistance to Malta.(b)   There should he a consultative body in Malta underthe chairmanship of the Governor where matters inregard to defence and foreign affairs and otherreserved subjects would be discussed, and whereeconomic and financial matters could he raised.Members of this body should be drawn as appropriatefrom Maltese Ministers and officials, from theImperial Branch, and from the Services.21o    The consultations in Malta on reserved matters should be mainly concerned with measures which require to he taken in malta, while the consultations in London would he primarily concerned with wider aspects of United Kingdom foreign affairs and defence which might affect Malta.    It would &quot;be necessary from the outset to make it clear that the London Committee wasnot a combined United Kingdom and Malta Cabinet with power of final decision on any defence or foreign affairs matterconcerning Malta, and also not a place where actions already taken by the Governor would be reversed.    It would clearly benecessary that, when the Governor found that the Maltese membersof the Consultative Committee were in disagreement with anyproposed course of action put to them, he should normally haveto seek the instructions of the Secretary of State before any action were taken.   This would give the Secretary of State theopportunity of deciding whether or not action should be deferred until&apos;the London Committee had been consulted.   there might, however, be occasions when for reasons of urgency itwould be necessary for action to be taken on defence matters in malta without prior reference to the Secretary of State.22.    One other reservation must he made.   While he was inLondon talks started between Mr. Mintoff and the service departments about establishing machinery for consultation,negotiation and arbitration in connection with wage disputes.The result of these negotiations will have to be taken intoaccount.23*    The proposed London Committee could be given an enhancedstatus if it were constituted as a Committee of the privy council comparable to the Committee responsible for the affairs of the Channel Islands.    It would obviously not be feasible forthe Maltese Ministers to be made Privy Councillors, but itmight be much more attractive to the Maltese if the LondonCommittee were formally constituted as a Committee of the privy council for Maltese Affairs, which invited Maltese Ministersinto consultation with it.2h.    The introduction of administrative arrangements on theselines would not in itself involve any modification of theexisting written constitution of Malta.    In conjunction withthem certain modifications might be made in the Malta consti-tution in order to remove some of the objections which the maltese have to the present form of dyarchy.    These modificationsare:-(a)   The existing Nominated Council and Privy Council wouldbe abolished, and, in the exercise of his functionson the reserved side, the Governor would be
134required normally to consult a Council which included Maltese Ministers as well as officials and service representatives..    The Governor should have discretion not to consult this Council when for reasons of urgency, triviality or prejudice toHer Majesty&apos;s service he thought this desirable.(b) The Governor would have to accept the advice of his ministers in Executive Council on non-reserved matters, in all cases except those in which publicfaith was involved.(c) The Governor would (subject to the control of theSecretary of State) decide what is or is not are served matter.    The existing list of such matters(Annex i) could be retained, but it might be preferable to substitute for it a general formulaunder which any matter which the Governor of Maltacertified to be a matter required for the purposesof or in the interests of defence policy of theUnited Kingdom, or the defence of Malta itself, or was a matter relating to external affairs ornationality would be a reserved mattere    These changes should not involve any reduction of the special powersreserved to Her Majesty in an emergency.25o    If it were thought that the perpetuation of a separatelegislature in Malta to legislate on reserved matters would prove unacceptable, it would be possible to abolish theGovernor&apos;s pov/ers to legislate by Ordinance, and instead toarrange that Her Majesty in Council would legislate for Maltaon reserved matters by Order-in-Council on the advice of a secretary of State who would normally consult the LondonConsultative Committee referred to in paragraph 20(a) abovebeforehand on the policy to which the Order-in-Council wouldgive effect.Association with the United Kingdom Parliament26.   The Conference may wish to consider whether in conjunctionwith the proposals outlined above, any form of association withthe United Kingdom Parliament short of full representation couldbe granted to Malta0     There appear to be two main possibilities.27o    The first is that Malta should have one or morerepresentatives in the House of Commons who would be entitledto ask questions and to take part in debates on foreign affairs and defence but who would not have the right to vote.Mr. Mintoff rejected this idea at the London discussions, but iffull Parliamentary representation for Malta is found to be unacceptable such an arrangement would accord with the realities of the situation and would meet the claim of Maltathat they should have a voice in foreign affairs and defence matters.     This would be a notable innovation.     The second is that one or more representatives chosen by the MaltaLegislature should be enabled to sit in the House of Lords8    in either case it would be difficult to maintain that the case of malta could be distinguished from that of other Colonies, asunder an arrangement of this sort Malta would not be in any wayintegrated with the United Kingdom except for foreign affairs and defence.28.    The proposals outlined in paragraphs 20-25 would not imply any alteration in Malta&apos;s position as a separate political entity,outside the United Kingdom itself.     They carry no new implicationsas to the extent of assistance to be given by the United kingdom to Malta, which would be decided on its merits from time to timein the light of the agreed Statement of July last (Annex II).
B.      PULL PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION FOR MALTAComparison of the, Mintoff Proposals with the. ^Existing;Relationship with Northern^ireland^d.29.    It is convenient at the outset to compare the Mintoffproposals for Malta with the existing relationship with NorthernIreland.      The main differences are:-(a) The division of powers in Northern Ireland a defined list of matters isreserved by Statute to the United Kingdom Parliament and government.     This is similar in scope to the existinglist of reserved subjects in MalSa,.      In addition. UnitedKingdom legislation applies in Northern Ireland unless thecontrary is provided,.     In practice, the power of Parliamentto legislate for Northern Ireland, on transferred mattersis used only after consultation and with the consent of theNorthern Ireland Government, but the specific reservationand use of this power recognises both the supremacy ofParliament and the ultimate authority of the BritishGovernment in all matters.There is no comparable provision in the Mintoff plan for dealing with the problem of divided legislative authority.(b) Customs TariffsNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom forCustoms as for other purposes.     Malta would have a separateCustoms tariff.(c) TaxationNorthern Ireland pays United Kingdom rates of bothdirect and indirect taxation with certain minor agreedexceptions,,       Malta would become subject to UnitedKingdom   direct taxation after an interim period of fifteen years or more but would remain autonomous in respect ofindirect taxation.(d) Financial contributionNorthern Ireland makes a contribution to ImperialDefence expenditure.     Malta would not be in a positionto do this.      It is envisaged that even after the interim period Malta would continue to receive a subvention fromthe United Kingdom.300    The Northern Ireland system has worked only because of the peculiar historical and geographical circumstances, the determination of both sides to make it work, and the common back-ground of members of the two Administrations.   The majorityof Ulsterrs population   strongly desire that their country should remain part of the United Kingdom and are ready to accept any limitation of their autonomy which is necessary to preserve the Union.     Up to 1920 Northern Ireland had for more thana century been administered as part of the United Kingdomj   itpossesses a similar structure of trade and commerce, and of lawand administration.      It is subject to the same judicial system.
These conditions do not exist in Malta.     In the field within its responsibilities Northern Ireland has readily adopted measuressimilar to those taken in Great Britain.     The essence of thearrangement is that Northern Ireland&apos;is part of the UnitedKingdom.     From this it follows that, although It possesses&apos;autonomy in a wide range of matters such as social services,industrial and labour matters, agricultural policy, and public utilities, it Is entitled to adopt in all these fields the samepolicies as are being applied in the United Kingdom.     The costof such measures is set against the revenues raised in NorthernIreland and so, in effect, reduce Northern Ireland&apos;s contributionto Imperial revenues.     In practice, Northern Ireland, althoughautonomous for most internal matters except taxation, is1 integrated1 with and part of the United Kingdom for all important purposes.TJae, Implications of Parliamentary Representation for Malta31.   It is desirable to examine:-(a) How far and in what respects it v/ould &quot;be practicable for the affairs of Malta to be integrated with thoseof the United Kingdom,(b) What would be the financial implications for the UnitedKingdom of Parliamentary representation cf Malta.(c) The possibleirepercussions of granting ParliamentaryRepresentation&apos;to Malta on constituent parts of theUnited Kingdom, and on other Colonial territories.(a)   The Possibilities of integration *Direct Taxation32.    It would be practicable as a matter of administration toapply United Kingdom direct taxation in Malta and to control its administration from London.     This would mean applying to Maltathe whole of the relevant United Kingdom law.     Apart from thefact that United Kingdom rates of t ax on individuals are considerably higher, the imposition of United Kingdom rates of company and profits tax would discourage local enterprise.Moreover, if effect is given to the proposals of the RoyalCommission on the Taxation of Profits and Income that a scheme should be introduced for recognising a special category of over-seas trading corporation, the profits of which would, on certain conditions, be exempt from United Kingdom tax, then theintroduction of the higher United Kingdom rates into Malta would naturally make the Island a much less attractive place to UnitedKingdom companies,33.   It is not possible without a special enquiry to estimate the revenue which would be obtained by applying United Kingdomdirection taxation in Malta, but it is likely that there wouldbe a high level of exemptions particularly as a result of the allowances for children under the United Kingdom tax system.Oustoms^and Excise Duties3k;   It might be held that integration&apos; should imply, for fiscalpurposes, parity not only of direct but also of indirect taxation -in the sense that there should be common rates of Customs and excise duties in the United Kingdom and in Malta, and goodsproduced in wne country should be admitted free of Customs duty in the other,
I t4&amp;35*   The question arises whether the United kingdom s rates of duty and of purchase tax could he introduced into Malta.     Asregards the practical aspects of revenue administration,this would he possible if United Kingdom customs and. Excise lav; were made applicable in Malta, with some additionsor adaptations to fit the local circumstances.     For example, thepassage of dutiable goods between the United Kingdom and Malta would still have to be treated as foreign trade for the purposeof Customs control.     The Maltese Customs and Excise service would,&quot; of course, have to come under United Kingdom control.36.   But to transfer the United Kingdom system of indirect taxation an this basis to Malta would have several disadvantagesfrom the Maltese point of view.     In the first place, overh.0 per cent of Malta revenue is at present derived fromCustoms duties.     Nearly half Malta1s imports come from theUnited Kingdom, and a serious reduction in revenue would followboth from free admission of United Kingdom goods and from the abatement in the duties on many foreign goods which would result if the United Kingdom tariff were adopted.     This lass ofrevenue could perhaps be made good by the imposition of purchase tax, and from the increased yield of the duties on tobacco,oil and alcoholic drinks, which are generally at much higher rates in the United Kingdom than at present in Malta;   but thewithdrawal of protection against United Kingdom goods would bea serious matter for the small industries which already exist in Malta and would militate against any possibility there maybe of persuading United Kingdom firms to set up new industries in malta if they are to produce mainly for the local market.There would be no corresponding advantage to Malta by way of increased export opportunities to the United Kingdom;    alreadyabout 90 per cent of the United kingdom s imports from Maltaenjoy duty-free admission under preference.37.   Moreover, it is open to doubt whether that part of thesystem of Customs and Excise duties which has been developed as a means of raising revenue in the United Kingdom would really bethe most suitable instrument for the same purpose in the very different   economic and social circumstances in Malta,     Forexample, the cheap wine that is commonly sold in Mediterraneancountries would certainly not stand the United kingdom s rate of duty.     Local variations in the duties would seem unavoidable;and that being so, there is much to be said for leaving Malta to raise its proper share of indirect taxation.under anindependent tariff adapted to its own local needs and conditions,38.    It therefore seems very improbable that United Kingdom ratesof Customs and Excise duties could ever be applied to Malta.This might give rise to some complaint from United Kingdom firmson the ground that if Malta is represented in Parliament it .1s ineffect part of the United Kingdom and should give UnitedKingdom traders free access to the Maltese market - indeed onetrade association has already made the point - but the Maltesemarket is so small that complaints are not likely to create aserious problem.Currency and Monetary Policy39,   At present Malta issues her own currency, but can hardly be said to have an independent monetary policy.     Her currencyis backed 100 per cent by sterling or sterling securities.     Ifintegration were held to involve the withdrawal of the Maltesecurrency and the substitution of sterling, this would have no economic effects but the Maltese Government might lose some 300,000 a year from interest on the currency backing, and thepossibility of investing part of that backing In local loans.This might mean that the United Kingdom subventions to Malta would have to be correspondingly increased.
Ul2Social ServicesU0,   Expenditure per head on social services in the UnitedKingdom is estimated by Dr. Balogh to be about four times thatin Malta,     If the United Kingdom system were applied directly to malta it would involve high contributions and benefits, bothcompletely out of line with incomes in Malta.     Such measures would not only be extremely expensive but impracticable at thepresent time.     It is recognised by Mr. Mintoff that Malta1ssocial services must be designed to fit Maltese conditions andthat they can only be raised to United Kingdom levels over asubstantial period.     The real question is whether Malta will, inany foreseeable time, be able to pay for social services on theUnited Kingdom scale.     If not, representation of Malta InParliament may be regarded as giving her a right to receivesuch benefits at the expense of the United Kingdom.Location of Industry, ,and Industrial. development +1.   The Maltese appear to believe that one of the economic advantages to Malta from integration would be the applicationof United Kingdom development area policy to Malta.     This might mean either that the Board of Trade would undertake to do what it could to encourage industralists to go to Malta or that theUnited Kingdom distribution of industry legislation would bemade applicable to Malta Y/hich could also be scheduled as a development area.     Little benefit could be expected merely fromexhortations to firms by the B^ard of Trade.     The power toschedule areas as development areas apply only where there is aspecial danger of unemployment, which is not at present the casein Malta,     If It were agreed that powers of the kind available in development areas should be taken in Malta, it would seempreferable that this should be done by local legislation as isthe case in Northern Ireland,Defence tand Foreign AffairsI4.2,   The natural consequence of the Mintoff proposals might bethat existing United Kingdom law in these matters would applyto Malta immediately.   In the field of foreign affairs the mainlegislation relates to diplomatic privileges and would be applied in any case.     In the field of defence it is certain there area good many provisions in United Kingdom law which would be neither appropriate nor needed in Malta.     Therefore in practiceMalta would have to be exempted from a large part of this legislation from the outset,     Mr. Mintoff has made it clear thathe would not agree to United Kingdom laws relating to NationalService applying in Malta,     For special reasons, this legislationdoes not apply In Northern Ireland,JudicialU3,   The Malta judicial system is distinct and not based uponthe British system.     At present Malta1s final Court of Appealis the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.     Certain UnitedKingdom laws already apply in Malta and are interpreted there bythe Malta Courts.   Under integration the number of United Kingdomstatutes applied to Malta would increase, particularly if theIncome Tax and Estate Duty Acts were applied to Malta.     It might then be desirable to provide that where United Kingdom lawsapply to Malta appeals should lie to the House of Lords and natto the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
1^Constitutionalkk*    In order to deal with the problem of division of powersbetween Parliament and the Malta Legislature it would benecessary for the Maltese to agree that Parliament shouldcontinue to have and on occasions exercise overriding powerof legislation in all fields as it has in Northern Ireland.Apart from this it would be impracticable to bring Mr. Mintoffsproposals more nearly into line with the existing arrangements with Northern Ireland without a gradual process of developmentsuch as he envisages in the interim period.   The immediate question is therefore whether representation in. parliament could be accorded to Malta now, when the only powers to beexercised by the United Kingdom Parliament in Malta would beprincipally in the field of foreign affairs and defence.(b)    The Financial Implications for the United Kingdomk5*   However much Mr. Mintoffs proposals and the UnitedKingdom&apos;s commitments might be limited in the course of negotiation it is very possible that public opinion in Malta would regard representation in Parliament as giving Malta an eventual right to standards of social services and wagessimilar to those in the United Kingdom.   It also seems likely that public opinion in this country would regard the presenceof Maltese representatives in Parliament as a recognition of malta as part of the United Kingdom.   Members of the Conferenceought therefore, to take into account the strong possibility that representation for Malta in Parliament will be regarded asa commitment to assist Malta to achieve eventually the curr-entUnited Kingdom standards of social services and a level ofeconomic development not far out of line with that in theUnited Kingdom, irrespective of Malta&apos;s own capacity to suppor tsuch services.   The proposal for Parliamentary representation for Malta must be considered in the light of the possibility of,developing Malta&apos;s economy to a point at which it could itselfsupport United Kingdom levels of social and other serviceswithout subventions from the United Kingdom considerably greaterthan what would be available under any other constitutionalrelationship.The level of United Kingdom Expenditure on Maltah-6.   In 1955/56 the United Kingdom Government, are financingexpenditure by the Government of Malta amounting to  4.7 million in addition to expenditure by the Service Departments in Malta.Of this, rather more than  &amp; million would come from the specialgrant of approximately  30 million for war damage reconstruction,which is now nearing exhaustion, and approximately  850,000 was for civil defence, stockpiling and emigration.    In order togive effect to the Agreed Statement made after the Londondiscussions in July last - that is to say, in order to avoidserious unemployment in Malta, and to provide for some gradualimprovement in the level of social services - United Kingdomassistance to Malta in the next five years might, it isestimated, have to run at about  5 million a year exclusive ofthe cost of the Imperial Branch (which would in any case be a united Kingdom liability).     This would include  3-4 million for capital expenditure and  1-1^ million for assistance to the malta Budget.     The amount required after the next five yearscannot be forecast.     It will depend upon the success of thedevelopment programme, the amount of private saving in Malta,the level of Service expenditure and the trend of emigration,as well as upon the rate of increase in expenditure on social services.
The Possibilities of Developing the Maltese Economyk7.   The economy of Malta Is   narrowly based and It cannot new payitself for any substantial improvement in social services.     Ifit is to have the same rates of tax and social   services, andnot to be a conspicuously depressed area compared with the restof the United Kingdom,   it is roughly estimated that development would have to proceed at a rate which would at least doubleincome per head in the interim period, i.e.,   fifteen to twenty years.     (This calculation is mere fully set out in annex VI.)I4.8.   It Is clear that any genuine economic development must take the form of expansion of civilian activities.     It shouldnot be sought merely through an increase in expenditure by theServices resulting from the grant of higher rates of wages,though the Services may be expected to provide higher wages asthe general level of wages rises.     The claim that Maltese workers employed by the Service departments should be paid tho samewages as their United Kingdom employees was a prominent feature of the original integration proposals of the Malta Labour Party.The Service departments have recently granted a 10 per cent increase to their Maltese workers following similar action bythe Malta Government, and if the Malta Government grants furtherpay increases It will be difficult for the Services to avoiddoing the same.     It is important that the  Maltese should recognise that the prospects of economic development depend uponthe Malta Government exercising a policy of wage restraint atany rate for some years,k10.   In his Interim report, Dr, Balogh estimates tentatively thatif 10 per cent of the gross national Income, or at present 3-3ik million a year, were made available by the United. kingdom for capital development this might over a long period beexpected to produce an increase in national incwme of nearly5 per cent per annum.     If this were so the rate of expenditureenvisaged in paragraph k&amp; might be enough to double thelevel of income per head in Malta in fifteen to twenty years,if the flow of emigration could be well maintained.50.   Any such estimate depends, however, on whether there are sufficient potential economic resources in Malta which canprofitably &quot;Ue developed.     Admittedly, there has not yet been a proper geological survey or full review of the possibilities,and Dr, Balogh is to report further on this subject- but hisinterim report outlines the possibilities as seen at the presenttime.     It is very doubtful indeed whether these justify his general estimate of the long-term rate of development which ispossible.     The interim report suggests that agriculture and fishing, the tourist trade, and the civilian harbour all offeropportunities for development.     It seems unlikely, however, thatthese industries alone could provide a rapid expansion of the maltese economy,     Dr, Balogh therefore concludes   that anyreally substantial advance must come from the development of manufacturing industry in Malta and that this depends onattracting to Malta a number of overseas firms for which purposebasic services must first be developed.     In paragraphs 10U-109of his interim rep&amp;rt Dr. Balogh says that the prospects dependmainly upon United Kingdom firms being attracted to Malta by theapplication of location of industry and development arealegislation to Malta, and by the United Kingdom  Governmentrequiring that a proportion of defence orders of certain typesmust be executed in Malta,     Dr, Balogh himself concludes that&quot;without some such purposive British action we are unable to see how Maltese productive capacity could grow quickly enough toenable a steady but slow decrease of dependence on direct BritishGovernment grants&quot;;    and again in paragraph 109 &quot;all thestimuli we have suggested will be needed If enough British firms are to be attracted.     Only in this way can sufficiently quickprogress be achieved to raise Maltese income and to relieve theBritish taxpayer of his responsibility (or at least substantiallyreduce it) in the foreseeable future.&quot;
51.   This seems to presuppose that the Government have powersto direct firms to particular areas, which is not the case^andalso that it would he feasible to direct defence orders toinexperienced and untried firms.     It is very unlikely that any considerable number of British firms will he attracted to Maltaby any measures which it would he practicable to take,     Maltasuffers from serious disadvantages.     It has, so far as isknown, no natural deposits of industrial materials or fuel.It lacks water.     It cannot at present provide industrial&apos;services such as facilities for putting out toolroom t?ork,which are needed by small branch businesses.     Its home market,even when protected from competition from the United Kingdom,is too small to attract United Kingdom firms on its ov/n merits and the main market to which Malta has free access, the UnitedKingdom, is far away.     Its advantages are Its climate, the factthat it has been shov/n in the dockyard that its people can&quot;become good industrial workers, and its low labour costs.     Thelast is offset by the fact that it is the objective of theMint off proposals and of all parties in Malta to raise wages to-v/ards United Kingdom standards.52,   It has been far from easy to attract industry to NorthernIreland even though it has the facilities of an industrialcentre and although considerable Inducements have been offered.These&quot;have included the provision of factory sites on favourable terms, loans and grants to meet initial capital expenditures,and the provision of direct subsidies based on fuel consumption.In spite cf these advantages, transport problems and costs andthe unwillingness of managerial and technical, staff to go to northern Ireland have remained deterrents and there is still ahigh rate of unemployment there.     This experience suggeststhat it is unlikely that British firms could he persuaded bysimilar measures to set up branches in Malta on any substantial scale,53.   Apart from the doubt as to whether It will be practicable to develop Malta1 s economy to the extent required, there aretwo important factors in Malta&apos;s economic situation \rhich mightalter to her disadvantage.     The first is Service expenditiire.Part I of this Memorandum shows the extent to which Malt a&apos;internal economy and balance of payments depend on this expenditure, and any considerable reduction in It would substantially offset the results of new development which may heachieved.     The second is the rate of emigration. ,   The natural increase in the population in Malta Is. at a high rate - between1^-2 per cent per annum in recent years.     Between 1949 and 1954a total of 39,000 people emigrated from Malta so that the netpopulation has been rising only at about -g- per cent per annum.But no less than  2.6 million have been spent in this period insubsidising emigration.     Part of this money has been providedby recipient Commonwealth countries and a large proportion bythe United Kingdom.   It the rate of emigration fell off, as itmight well do if the result of development efforts is to raisewages and increase the prospects of remunerative emplojrmentin Malta, this would increase the size of the problem.
Financial Implications for the United Kingdom5k,   If Parliamentary representation were granted to Malta,and Dr. Balogh&apos;s assessment of the possibilities of developmentproved In the event to be much too optimistic, Malta would remain much poorer than the United Kingdom, and one of two alternative situations would ultimately arise.     The first would be acceptance of a situation in which Malta&apos;continuedpermanently to receive a lower standard of   wages, social serviceand other benefits, and to pay lower rates of direct taxationthan prevail in the United Kingdom,     In that event the costto the United Kingdom of financial assistance to Malta might beno more than If Parliamentary representation had not beengranted, although pressure for quick advance might be increased.It is difficult to see how in such circumstances Parliamentaryrepresentation could be refused to other Colonies which asked for it on the same terms.     The second would be that United Kingdomstandards ef benefits would eventually have to be introduced in malta under pressure of public opinion, and that, in so far asMalta could not pay for them, the cost would fall on the UnitedKingdom in the form of a larger direct subvention to the MaltaBudget than might otherwise be required, and ef increased wagesand social service contributions paid by the Service departments.If the grant of full representation in Parliament will constitutein effect a commitment that Malta will eventually receive UnitedKingdom standards of social benefits, this is the risk which hasto be assessed.     It Is not possible to estimate what the costto the United Kingdom might be.     It would depend on the successof the development effort and on the trends of emigration and service expenditure.     It might also be affected by increases in the standards of &quot;benefits prevailing in the United   Kingdom,Apart from the cost, a virtual guarantee by the United Kingdomof eventual similarity of social service standards and wagelevels, whatever the Malta economy can Itself stand, might seriously weaken the incentive to the Maltese to inprove theirstandards by their own efforts,(0)   Repercussions of accepting; the Mintoff proposals on theconstituent&quot;parts of the^United Kingdom and o,n&quot;o&quot;therCo loniairir err it ories&apos;\ Scotland ,and Wales55.   If Parliamentary representation is granted to Malta on thesame basis as Northern Ireland, with a greater degree of autonomyand (at the outset at any rate) lower rates of taxation than are carried by Scotland and Northern Ireland, the demand for aseparate Scottish Parliament would certainly be stimulated.     Somay the claim for a differential system of taxation applicable to,Scotland,     It might well be asked why, if Malta can be exempt from the United Kingdom direct taxation until her economicstandards have been raised with United Kingdom assistance, and can at the same time receive representation in Parliament, thesame principle should not be applied to Scotland where the averageincome is admittedly less than In England and Wales.56,   Similarly in Wales, impetus might be given to the movement for autonomy for Wales on the Northern Ireland pattern.Hitherto it has been recognised that the imperial contribution which  would be paid by an independent Wales   would be so heavyin proportion to her revenue that Wales would suffer a decline in her standard of living.     But, If it could be claimed that wales should have more generous treatment an the model of the proposedMalta arrangements, much more support might be forthcoming,even though the possession of a separate Parliament on theNorthern Ireland model would reduce the representation of wales in the House of Commons.
Northern Ireland51*    Northern Ireland opinion might well dislike the grant to malta of greater autonomy than Northern Ireland possesses, butit would probably not react by demanding similar treatment.If the Mintoff plan was accepted Northern Ireland might wellask that consideration should be given to the equity of taxingNorthern Ireland at the same level as the rest of the UnitedKingdom, in view of the undoubted economic disabilities of thecountry.    There might also be pressure to increase thefinancial assistance for economic development in NorthernIreland,&apos; . -Colonial Territories&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;58,    The larger Colonial territories, and some of the smallerones if they are brought into Federations, can expect to movegradually towards the achievement of a fully independent status and to become candidates for full Commonwealth membership.These apart, however, there remain twenty smaller territories,in addition to Malta, most of which cannot expect to reach thatstatus because their size, geographical situation, and economic resources will not enable them to stand alone in the worldwithout external assistance,  . The question is whether Maltacan be clearly distinguished from these other smaller terri-tories, or whether, if Malta is given representation in theUnited Kingdom Parliament, there is likely to be such pressure for similar treatment from a number of other territories thatthey, or some of them, may ultimately have to be givenrepresentation also,59o    Her Majesty1s Government consider that the grant of representation to Malta is not in itself likely to stimulatepressure for similar treatment in any of the smaller colonial territories,-   The majority of them are likely to regardrepresentation at Westminster, implying a greater control oftheir affairs by the United Kingdom Parliament, as less acceptable than a growth of greater local responsibility for handling their own affairs in their own Legislative and executive bodies.    In these cases it  would probably beaccepted that a radical solution of Malta&apos;s relationship withthe United Kingdom xias justified by Malta1 s unique circumstances,60.    It is however possible that assistance given by her majesty&apos;s Government to Malta to help in raising the levels of wages and of social services either up to, or substantiallytowards, the United Kingdom standards might well bring pressure from some smaller Colonial territories for the like assistance;and, if need be, for representation as a necessary corollary.&apos; &apos; .: &apos; &apos; &apos;        &apos;61.    The financial assistance to Malta, both for development and for current expenses, which might be involved in a commit-ment to aim at parity with the United Kingdom in wages and social services, would be on a scale far greater in proportionthan that given to any other Colony, and this fact would undoubtedly be noticed elsewhere.    This disparity in itselfcould be defended by Malta&apos;s special position - even existinghelp to Malta is to some extent disproportionate - but theeffect elsewhere of any acceptance for Malta of United Kingdomstandards of social services and wages, might be considerable.This would be a new concept with clear attractions for many other Colonies, particularly if the cost is virtually guaranteed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government; and if it is coupled with no obligation to adopt United Kingdom tax rates the position wouldbe difficult to hold against demands from other Colonies for similar treatment,    Malta already enjoys a standard of living -
I Styhigher than that in most Colonies, and it might &quot;be extremely-difficult to convince the others that Malta&apos;s position was indeed so unique as to justify such specially favourable treatment.Other Considerations62.    There remain certain other considerations to which attention should be drawn:-(a) The division of opinion in MaltaMaltese opinion is at present divided on the Mintoffproposals.    The Malta Nationalist Party, which polledi+0 per cent of the votes at the recent Election, is strongly opposed to them.    The attitude of the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, v/ho have great influence, isstill uncertain, although their main preoccupation is with possible interference in Church matters by the United kingdom parliament, which is not involved in the Mintoff proposals.Mr. Mintoff proposes that if Her Majesty&apos;s government accept his proposals they should &quot;be the subject of a referendum in Malta before effect is given to them.    Evenif the result of the referendum were favourable, however,there is the risk that a change of Government in Maltamight create a challenge to integration as a permanent solution.(b) The position of Malta Members of ParliamentAlthough they might be drawn from both.Parties in malta, there is a risk that the Malta members might offertheir support, in matters which affect the United Kingdomalone, to the Party which was willing to do the most formaltality.    At times when the Government had only a smallmajority in Parliament this might be embarrassing.Moreover, at any rate until direct taxation in Maltabecame a matter for the United Kingdom Parliament, the maltese members would not have many opportunities toraise in general debate matters of direct concern to Malta.This might lead to a sense of frustration, which would react on public opinion in Malta and thus lessen the^ political attractions of the Mintoff proposals.(c) Method of RepresentationMr. Mintoff has insisted that Malta should have atleast three representatives.    Assuming that, as he proposes,the British electoral system on the basis of adult suffragewere used in Malta, there would be about 150,000 voters, or50,000 per constituency.    This is about the same on theaverage as in Great Britain, but in Northern Ireland thereare approximately 75*000 voters in each constituency andit is a recognised feature of Northern Ireland&apos;s position. that, because she has a separate Parliament of her own,she has fewer representatives in proportion to herelectorate than the rest of Great Britain.    It may bethought desirable to maintain this principle in Malta,because one of the reasons which withholds support fromthe demand for a separate Parliament for Wales on theNorthern Ireland model is that Wales would then receivesmaller representation in Parliament at Westminster.An alternative to direct election would be for Malta to be represented by Members elected by the MaltaLegislative Assembly in proportion to its own composition.But this would be a departure from the Northern Irelandmodel.-It)-&quot;
63*    The case for giving full representation in Parliament to malta is that to do so provides the best hope of solving along-standing political problem, and of securing full Malteseco-operation in foreign affairs and defence matters.    This isthe first time that a Colonial Government has made proposals todraw closer to the United Kingdom.    If these proposals arerebuffed, there may well be an intensification of friction andobstruction over defence requirements in Malta.    All MalteseParties demand some modification of the present rigid dyarchy.The Mintoff proposals aim at achieving this, while enabling thenecessary powers to be retained by Her Majesty&apos;s Government inforeign affairs and defence matters, by giving Malta an effectivevoice in Parliament.    Representation in Parliament is the essence of the proposals.    This would be regarded by the Maltese asvisible assurance that they could make their views known inLondon, and share in decisions taken there on matters affectingtheir vital interests.    It would also be regarded as carrying an assurance of financial and economic support for Malta&apos;s develop-ment plans and for the achievement, of their long-term objective of attaining United Kingdom standards of wages and social servicebenefits.64*    The following main considerations have to be weighed in reaching a decision on the Mintoff proposals;-(i)   The proposed relationship would.give Malta considerably more autonomy than Northern Ireland.    In particular,at least for ten years, and perhaps indefinitely,Malta representatives would be entitled to speak and vote in the House of Commons on all matters, althoughMaltese taxation was not under the control of theUnited Kingdom Parliament, and the Maltese were notbearing the full burden of United Kingdom rates oftaxation.The question arises as to how Malta&apos;s Budget would heoperated if direct taxation in Malta comes under theImperial parliament to    It would he necessary to ensure thatthe Maltese fixed levels of indirect taxation which taken with United Kingdom rates of direct taxation ahsorhed a proportion of the national income in Malta broadly comparablto that taken by taxation in the United Kingdom after taking into account the difference in the levels of income and thefact that there is no local authority taxation in Malta.Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the Maltese wouldhave to agree that both in the interim period and after theyhave become liable to United Kingdom direct taxes, theremust continue to be regular consultation in regard to their proposed revenue and expenditure, and that the UnitedKingdom contribution to their Budget would continue to be dependant, as it is now, on Her Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied that Malta is raising taxation on an adequate scale.SUMMARY OP CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING PARLIAMENTARY representation for MALTA
(ii)   The acceptance of Parliamentary representation formaltality is likely to he regarded as a commitment onthe part of the United Kingdom that Malta will eventually have &quot;broadly the same standards of social and other benefits and the same level of wages asprevail in the United Kingdom irrespective of whatthe economy of Malta can itself sustain.(iii)   Even v/ith considerable United Kingdom assistance for development, it is very doubtful on present information whether Malta&apos;s resources could eversupport United Kingdom standards of benefits and wages.    If this proves to be so, the .extra cost ofgiving Malta such standards will eventually fallon the United Kingdom.    The size of this risk cannotbe precisely assessed,(iv)   Acceptance of the principle that the United Kingdom. should help Malta to achieve United Kingdom standards of wages and social benefits might well provokestronger demands for increased financial assistancein Scotland and Northern Ireland and in someColonial territories.    The claim for differentialrates of taxation in Scotland and Northern ireland would also be strengthened so long as lower ratesof direct taxation applied in Malta,(v)   Because of the division of opinion in Malta it is uncertain whether Parliamentary representation wouldbe accepted permanently,(vi)   The Malta members of the House of Commons would,in the interim period, have little opportunity of raising matters of direct concern to Malta exceptthrough intervention in general debates on foreignaffairs and defence.    This might in practice lessen the attractiveness of Parliamentary representationas a solution for local difficulties.    Prom time totime the support of the Malta members would acquiredisproportionate political value which might beused to secure concessions for Malta,^Annexes not reproduce^/
