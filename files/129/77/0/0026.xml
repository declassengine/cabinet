SIGNATURE OF THE PROTOCOLS OF amendments to THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI think I should inform my colleagues of the position reached onthe signature of the Protocols of Amendments to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).2.        Cn 30th March the Cabinet approved a statement of policy welcomingthe outcome of the review of the General Agreement  carried out last winter(C.C.(55) 27th Conclusions, Minute 10).    In that statement, which was published in a White Paper on 19th April, 1955 (Command 9413), we saidthat we would be signing the resulting instruments at the appropriatetimes.    The Protocols of Amendments are open for signature until15th November, and have already been signed by the United States.    a convenient time for us to carry out our declared intention of signing theseProtocols will be during the next Intersessional Meeting of the G.A.T.T.in Geneva later this month, and I have arranged for the Protocols to be signed on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government then.3.        There is a separate Agreement for the establishment of an organisation, to be known as the Organisation for Trade Co-operation, to administer the revised General Agreement.    United States  signature ofthis Agreement is subject to approval by Congress and no question ofour signing it arises at present.COPY NOCABEsTETP.T.Board of Trade, S.
