THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1948SECRET Copy No.31CP. (48) 1779th July, 1948CABINETIMPORT PROGRAMMES JULY 1948-JUNE 1949Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. This memorandum, and the accompanying documents, which have beenprepared by a committee of officials, have two distinct but related purposes. Thefirst is to seek authority from Ministers for the programmes and statistics to besubmitted in the course of the next few days by this country to O.E.E.C., makingour bids for E.R.P. aid for the ensuing twelve months. (The most important part of these programmes is, of course, the dollar balance of payments. Mycolleagues will recognise that figures submitted for individual scarce commoditieswill tend to become commitments which will bind our export, import and consump-tion policies). The second purpose is to invite Ministers to take certain decisions which will govern our purchases for the ensuing twelve months, whether in dollars or in other currencies.Programmes to be submitted to O.E.E.C.2. For convenience I am circulating as a separate memorandum(CP. (48) 178) summaries of the tables to be submitted to O.E.E.C. and the draftcovering memorandum which will also be submitted to 0&apos;.E.E.C setting outthe basis on which the tables have been prepared. I ask the authority of mycolleagues for these documents to be submitted to O.E.E.C., subject to any modi-fications which may be necessary to give effect to decisions reached at our meetingon Monday.3. Annexes A and B to the present paper explain the basis on which thesetables have been prepared and summarise the points for decision by Ministers.4. The programmes to be submitted to O.E.E.G have been prepared on thebasis already laid down by Ministers, namely (a) that we intend to maintain our reserves throughout the E.R.P. period at their level at the beginning of the period, ie., limiting our dollaroutgoings to our dollar income plus external aid;(&amp;) that our programme will concentrate on the achievement of viability.5. The total of the E.R.P. aid to which we have to work in the programmesubmitted for the twelve months July 1948 to June 1949 is limited tof 1,271 millions ;* we are also limited in the preparation of our programmes of individual commodities by availability. In fact, therefore, there has notbeen very much scope for manoeuvre in preparing these programmes.6. The particular points for decision on the programmes to be submittedto O.E.E.C. are :--(i) Wheat. For the reasons in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Annex B, I think we should show consumption and imports on basis of 100,000 tonsof flour consumption a week instead of the present estimate of103,000 tons. This would imply action now to hold consumption at100,000 tons the same actual level of consumption as in 1947-48.* This figure is derived from the &quot; Brown Books&quot; submitted by the United states administration to Congress; it was agreed by O.E.B.C. that programmes should be prepared onthis basis.35593 b
(ii) Coal-out coal exports to participating countries in 1948-49 will1 ^    have to be stated, and will tend to become a coinmitment.   This isbring discussed at the Economic Policy Committee to-day, and mycolleagues must make a final decision.(iii) Oil-As my colleagues are aware, oil is highly complex, and a number&apos;     of papers are being prepared.   The particular question here is thestatement we make about the extent to whicn we shall sell oil toparticipating countries. The line proposed is that we continue tosupply these countries if we get the aid of -$1,271 millions, but thatif we get less aid, we should seek to collect dollars or the equivalentfor selling them oil which costs us dollars. - ;(iv) Newsprint.-It will be necessary to tell the trade that the decisioncannot yet be taken to proceed to a 5-page newspaper in 1949.Adjustment of the Dollar Import programme. The programmes which we submit are in the nature of bids. We mustface the fact that we may not get E.R.P. aid to the extent envisaged. It willbe a very tough negotiation at Paris.8. Paragraph 17&apos; of Annex A lists some possible increases in our resources,over and above what is allowed for in the programmes submitted. In my view, the increases are so problematic that it would be most imprudent to reckon on any ofthem at the present time.9. We may have to make reductions in our dollar import programme of anything from $50 millions to $100 millions. I ask my colleagues now to decidewhere those reductions should be made if we are forced to make them. This isnecessary for two reasons. First, to give our negotiators some idea of what is inour minds, so that they will hot have to report back for further instructions at short notice. Second, some purchasing decisions must be taken now, for seasonaland other reasons, and we must make them in a way which will prevent a drain on our reserves if E.R.P. gives us less aid than $1,270 millions.10. Paragraph 21 of Annex A sets out various possibilities of makingsavings, totalling $100 millions : -Wheat ($25 millions). My colleagues should realise that the maintenance of human and animal consumption of wheat at the 1947-^18 level wouldinvolve reversal of the decision to allow farmers to keep 20 per cent, oftheir crop for animal feeding, as well as the limitation of flourconsumption to 100,000 tons a week. If we are to make this saving, wemust make it now. Once a firm decision has been announced to allow the farmers to retain 20 per cent., it will be impossible to secure savingsunder this head, however much E.R.P. aid, may be cut.Sugar ($10 millions). There is no procurement question here, for the sugarfor the next few months&apos; supplies is already bought. The saving to bemade is in consumption, for strengthening stocks and reducing the purchases we have to make later in the year. It would be possible to delay this decision for two months or so, at no more cost than the savingwhich would be achieved in these months&apos; consumption.Tobacco ($15 millions). An immediate decision must be taken as to how muchwe shall buy in the United States auctions which begin towards theend of this month. Limitation of the tobacco purchase as proposed wouldforce stocks to a low level by September 1949, and the manufacturers would probably insist on a cut in consumption of the order of 10 per centunless we could undertake to provide for purchases up to their full requirements from the 1949 crop. I am strongly in favour of a cut of at least $15 millions.Raw Materials ($30 millions).-Procurement of these supplies is a more orless continuous process, and it would be necessary to pare programmesonce,   xhe effects of this cut are not altogether clear-it is verylall in relation to the whole raw material intake-but I should hopeit would be possible to achieve the cut without damaging effects uponsmall in relation to the whole raw material intake-but I should hopeit would be possible to ao1&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; *u-  * -^ *       - 1industry and employment.Machinery ($20 millions).-1 do not think this should be cut To cutmachinery might have highly damaging effects, and also it would probablvland us in serious difficulties with E.C.A.
Non-Dollar Import Programme11. I now invite the attention of my colleagues to Annex C which contains a report on our non-dollar balance of payments, and particularly to the conclusions in paragraph 27. The statistics in this paper will have to be submitted toQ.E.E.C., but they are not likely to be closely examined by that body, which will of course be mainly interested in transactions which involve dollar payments.12. The situation revealed in Annex C is serious. When we suspendedconvertibility in August last we directed our attention, rightly and naturally,in the first instance to reducing the drain on our reserves of gold and dollars.Less attention was paid to imports from non-dollar sources, and indeed it wasa part of our policy to develop imports (especially of food) from non-dollar sourcesto compensate for the loss of dollar food.13. As Annex C shows, we are now planning to buy more than we can affordfrom many countries in the non-dollar world. I think it is now vital that weshould bring our non-dollar balance of payments programme fully under control,and I recommend that the following steps be taken : Rest of Sterling A rea(i) That the Programmes Committee submit an analysis in detail of 1948-49imports from sterling area, distinguishing between basic supplies and less essentials.(ii) That United Kingdom, import /export policy be worked out towards eachsterling area country (including Colonies), taking into account thelong-term development of imports that we require from that country,and her needs from us; this would then be discussed with the countries concerned, e.g., in connection with the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference.(iii) In the meantime, we must restore full Treasury control.   The Pro-grammes Committee should take steps to limit all commitments topurchase for delivery after the end of 1948 as narrowly as possible tothose required to maintain the current level of basic food rations andof industrial production.(iv) That, until it has been possible to take decisions on our future policy inregard to the sterling area, we should avoid prejudicing our freedomof action by the conclusion of long-term contracts even for essential supplies unless the case in favour of such contracts is overwhelming.Certain non-participating countries(i) that our position Avith each of the countries listed in paragraph 14 of annex C should be re-examined in the light of the total position setout in this paper, and import/export policy be revised accordingly.(ii) that in the meantime, no new contracts should be entered into with anyof these countries, except those which are commitments under bilateral agreement, without renewed authority from the Treasury.14. I do not think we can clarify our policy towards the other E.R.P.participating countries until the discussions of intra-European payments arenearer a conclusion.15. If the recommendations in this memorandum are adopted, the broadresult will be that we shall be holding back improvements in our standards of foodconsumption during the next twelve months rather than cutting back consumptionfrom its present level. We should also have sufficient raw materials to maintainemployment at the present level, but not enough to free materials from controland provide for the smooth and uninterrupted flow which permits industry towork in the best possible wav.R. S. C.9th July, 1948.
ANNEX ATHE DOLLAR PROGRAMME 1st JULY, 1948-30th JUNE, 19491 This annex deals with the dollar balance of payments programme forthe year July 1948 to June 1949. It and the following annexes set out the mattersrequiring policy decision on the programmes which we must submit to U.Ji.i..u.on 15th July.2 The purpose of the O.E.E.C. discussions is to determine the amount ofE R.P. aid which each participating country will receive in the year July 1948to June 1949. The O.E.E.C. countries have been told by E.C.A. to divide up the aid themselves. The programmes which are now submitted provide the tactualbasis upon which the negotiation will take place.The Amount of Aid3. Mr. Harriman has told O.E.E.C. that the aid available in this period will be $4,875 millions. He assumes in this that a further appropriation will bemade when the present one expires on 31st March, 1949. The figure to whichO.E.E.C. will now have to work is 10 per cent, below the original figure of $5-4billions for the July-June period which was the basis of published calculations(Brown Books) of the United States Administration. The aid actually allottedin the April-June 1948 quarter was $1-3 billions; very little of this has yetbeen paid out. though funds have been earmarked accordingly, and reimbursementis in progress.4. The effect of the Congressional deliberations has thus been to cut the aidby 10 per cent, assuming that a new appropriation is forthcoming before 31stMarch on the scale implied by Mr. Harriman.Distribution of Aid5. O.E.E.C. must make recommendations to E.C.A. on how the $4,875millions of aid is to be divided, in total and by commodity. The method of doing this is being discussed by O.E.E.C. now. In our view, the most effective method and the only one which can yield a reasonably quick answer is a negotiation onthe financial amount of aid. To provide a basis for this O.E.E.C. has asked for two sets of programmes for each country for the year July 1948 to June 1949;these will deal separately with about 100 commodities, and will embody fullbalance of payments forecasts, analysed in close detail. No distinction is made between loan and grant; probably 25 per cent, of our aid will be on a loan basis,but the position for different countries will vary.  The two programmes will be :  (i) A &quot; Budget &quot; programme, in which each country would use the amountof aid allotted to it in the Brown Books (i.e., about 10 per cent, morethan the aid available).(ii) A &quot;Requirements &quot; programme, in which each country states what itwould like, having regard to availability of commodities, andspecifically directed to the country&apos;s ultimate recovery and independence of external aid.These programmes, together with explanatory memoranda showing the effect of receiving aid on the &quot;Budget&quot; scale, and demonstrating the purpose of the&quot; Requirements,&quot; will be the stuff of the negotiation.6. The covering memorandum which we recommend should be submitted isin a separate paper to the Cabinet (CP. (48) 178). The programmes whichwe recommend are summarised in Table I and Table II of that paper.The Basis of Programmes7. Both programmes are based upon the two principles endorsed by ministers previously (E.P.C. (48) 11th Meeting)-i.e., that we must maintain our reserves at the level of the beginning of the E.R.P. period, and thatour programmes must contribute the maximum possible to the rehabilitation ofour economy.8. We have had to make certain special assumptions of generalimportance :  0(i) Canada.--The Canadian Government has told us that if Canada has agood harvest, we may be able to resume drawings on the Credit in
October. We have made an assumption that we shall be able to draw$60 millions. It is necessary to make some assumption, for it wouldbe against our interests to make no allowance at all (for we should then probably lose E.R.P. aid correspondingly if the Canadians were able to let us draw later on). The matter has been discussed with theCanadian authorities and they would have preferred that no figure for the credit should be included. Our High Commissioner haspointed out to them however that the consequence of this would be areduction in our dollar import programme and has recommendedthat we should, on our own responsibility, include a national figure for the Canadian credit, disguising it as best we can. The HighCommissioner has made it clear that even this will be unpalatableto the Canadians, but it is the less of the two evils.(ii) Argentina. We have assumed that we pay no dollars at all toArgentina during this period (which goes beyond the end of the AndesAgreement).   It would be most dangerous to base our import and consumption plans after the middle of 1949 on this assumption.(iii) &quot;Surplus&quot;   Commodities. We   have   excluded   all   less-essential commodities of a kind which United States interests may wish topress upon us (e.g., dried fruit).(iv) E.R.P. Financing. We have included the most essential supplies for financing by E.R.P. funds; Canadian wheat, oil (United states companies trade in the United Kingdom), machinery, shipping, rawmaterials (where administratively possible); we recommend thathalf our requirement of United States tobacco be purchased from ourown dollars, and not from E.R.P. The effect is that the list of goods and Services supplied on E.R.P. will look very businesslike(v) Strategic Materials. In view of the provision in the Act that 5 percent, of the local currency fund can be used for strategic materials (forwhich we should otherwise earn dollars), we have taken a conservative estimate of dollar receipts from sale of Colonial materials. But if allthe 5 per cent, were used, it would cost us $50 millions.The &quot; Budget &quot; programme . In this, we are limited to E.R.P. aid of 11,271 millions. Within thislimit, (and given Canadian credit as in paragraph 8 (i)) it will be possible tocontinue existing import policy from the dollar area. The implications are described in detail in CP. (48) 178; broadly speaking, this programme would main-tain present consumption of rationed foods, maintain tobacco consumption, permitsome development of the livestock programme, according to the coarse grainavailability from non-dollar sources, supply industry with raw materials and machinery on the present restricted scale, and keep the present rate of consumptionof petroleum products.10. This does not provide much fillip to recovery. It does not free newresources to rehabilitate industry or to develop overseas production. It certainlydoes nothing spectacular. But, nevertheless, a programme of this scale would keep our economy going and thus would permit some further progress with thevarious constructive activities which are improving our basic position theindustrial investment programme, oil refining, agricultural rehabilitation, develop-ment of exports, &amp;c.The &quot; Requirements &quot; Programme11. For the &quot; Requirements &quot; programme, we have added a number of items to a total of $400 millions, raising the total E.R.P. request to $1,670 millions : $ millions701232513210m400Feeding-stuffsFood       .......Tobacco   ...Raw materialsMachinery        ...Shipping (to carry these)
12 We are seriously limited by availability. In particular, the amount ofsteel available, even though based on more generous estimates of availability thanin the Budget programme, is far below a requirements programme that we could usefully submit. This programme would, however, be most useful if we could get the money to pay for it. It would satisfy the full needs of the livestockexpansion; it would ease the supply of non-ferrous metals and timber; it would permit some materials and tobacco stocking; it would enable last year&apos;s cuts inthe sugar and cheese rations to be restored, and buy canned fish and milk productstoo; it would provide a six-page newspaper. We have not included additionalpetrol, for we could obtain this only at other countries&apos; expense.13. In immediate practical terms, the requirements programme is academic,for there is not nearly enough aid even for the budget programme. But we regard it as important that O.E.E.C. should be in a position to submit a programme ofrealistic requirements to E.C.A. as well as the $4,875 millions programme.The Possible A id14. The &quot; Budget &quot; and &quot; Requirements &quot; programme, and their supportingmemoranda, are at this stage material for the aid-allocation negotiation and no more. It is likely that we shall have to accept some reduction below the $1,270millions figure on which the &quot; Budget &quot; programme is based for the total aidis 10 per cent. less. It must be remembered that many of the other participantsare much worse off than ourselves, and, in particular, that many of them haverelatively low financial reserves. We do not feel there is need for pessimism, butat the same time we clearly cannot rely upon achieving even the &quot; Budget &quot; figure.15. On the whole we think there is a reasonable prospect of our securing25 per cent, of the net aid allotted. Assuming that E.C.A. wishes to retain, say,5 per cent, of the $4,875 millions as a reserve for meeting special situations, thiswould give us, say, $1,150 millions.16. It will be necessary, at the end of the first stage of the O.E.E.C.negotiations for all countries to submit new programmes based upon a revisedprovisional distribution of aid. We think it would be prudent for Ministers toconsider how, say, $120 millions would be saved from the &quot; Budget&quot; programme.Indeed, it is necessary to make a provisional import programme determinationon a basis such as this, in order to guide present buying policy (and consumptionpolicy) in the interval before the amount of aid is ultimately determined (whichmay be at least three months).Possible Increases in Resources17.   The following possibilities can be considered : (i) Canadian Credit.-Vfe may get more than the $60 millions allowed for.The Canadian Government earlier hoped to let us draw 815 millions a month from October ($135 millions in the year). But this was dependent upon the harvest, prospects for which are entirely uncertain.A higher figure than $60 millions is possible. But we cannot rely upongetting any at all.(ii) Rest of Sterling Area. If Australia drew on I.M.F. and maintained her present stringent dollar economy, $50 millions would be &quot; saved.&apos;&apos;Mr. Chifley has stated that for entirely understandable reasons this isimpossible at present. Apart from this, it is unlikely that even the strongest pressure would reduce the call on our reserves on account ofthe rest of sterling area below $60 millions which we are allowing; inthe first half of this year the comparable call was at an annual rate(iii)
forward into the first half of 1949 at the rate planned for the end of1948, and some further increase may be possible. But this cannot be relied upon.(v) Prices. It is possible that world commodity prices will fall, though there is no sign of this at present. Only a very substantial reduction could significantly affect our situation in 1948-49, for important partsof our expenditure (e.g., Canadian wheat) have their prices alreadyfixed, and most of our purchases up to the end of the calendar year are already made.18. We cannot rely upon any of these possible improvements; they are allhighly speculative, and none of them are wholly within our control. Moreover,there are adverse possibilities which are not included in the figures; we have not made nearly full allowance, for example, for full use by E.C.A. of local currencyfunds to buy strategic materials (see paragraph 8 (v) above).Import Programme A adjustments19. When the amount of aid is firmly known, it will be necessary to fix anew dollar import programme correspondingly. In the meantime, however, it isnecessary to make a preliminary determination for two reasons :  (i) In a few week&apos;s time we shall have to submit a new programme toO.E.E.C., based upon a revised preliminary distribution of aid.(ii) We have to make certain purchasing and other decisions now, which infact commit us for a full year ahead.20. It is therefore necessary for planning purposes to make adjustmentsnow. Taking into account the possibilities under paragraph 17 above, and the uncertainties of aid, we consider that the dollar import programme should bereduced by S50-100 millions. Action should be taken on this where the need totake decisions enforces it; where no purchasing or other decisions are required,i.e.. where supplies are already contracted for, to impose the adjustments on consumption now would permit the accumulation of stocks and enable purchasesto be reduced later.21. In selecting the cuts the real difficulty is that the least damaging cuts tomake stopping the Canadian bacon and egg contracts at the end of 1948, orcontinuing then at a reduced rate, thereby saving up to $60 millions in the first half of 1949 are incompatible with our assumption that we draw upon theCanadian credit (even by $60 millions). Moreover Canadian Ministers have in thepast declared that the live-stock contracts and the wheat contract stand together(although there is no contractual commitment to this effect) and they mightconsequently denounce the wheat contract which, at any rate if present pricesstand, would cost us nearly as much as we were saving. Such action would lead toa major impasse in our relations with Canada. Another cut which would do little damage to our economy would be a cancellation or re-negotiation of some of theCanadian timber contracts; this would save, say, $10 millions, but would reallyembitter commercial relations (for we have already re-negotiated these contracts once).22.   The following are some possibilities totalling $100 millions : $ millionsWheat: maintenance of human and animal consumption at1947-48 level (when it was increased by potato shortage)would save $25 millions on Canadian wheat even if no wheatat all were bought from Russia and Roumania. This wouldinvolve : (i) Stocks at six weeks&apos; consumption in mid-1949,(ii) Keeping the 85 per cent, extraction rate.(iii) Reversing Minister&apos;s previous decision to let farmerskeep 20 per cent, of their crop (265,000 tons).(iv) Limiting flour consumption to 1947-48 average level of100,000 tons a week; the Ministry of Food considerthat consumption cannot be reduced below 103,000 tonsa week without danger of bread queues (156,000 tons).With no Russian and Roumanian wheat economies of130,000 tons would in any case have to be saved under (iii)
$ millions and (iv). If they were saved on (iii) the further $25 millionssavings on Canadian wheat would be divided equally between(iii) and (iv)      .........      ..........25Sugar: reduction in sugar for manufacture (i.e., 10 per cent,of present allocation). A cut of this nature would lead to afurther reduction in the production of confectionery, beer,soft drinks, &amp;c............. &quot;&apos;Tobacco: limitation of buying programme to minimum to holdmonths&apos; stock at September 1949 and maintain consump-tion; this would create difficulties for manufacturers,especiallv as it would involve substitution of Canadiantobacco for United States: if also there was doubt aboutpurchases from 1949 crop, a sharp consumption cutwould have to be imposed. The possibility of offsetting such a cut by the increased use of existing stocks of Balkan tobaccoshould be examined       ...      ...      ...      . - -      - - -      - - -      15Raw Materials : reduction of 5 per cent, in programmed importsfrom dollar area only 1 per cent, of imports from all sources.If this reduction were made the supply of raw materialsavailable to industry would during the year be significantlyabove the 1947 figure     ...      ....      ...      ...       ...      ...      30Machinery : further restriction of import licensing, which wouldapproach an absolute ban on imports of machinery forgeneral purposes and would take a long time to mature. Onthe assumption that no reduction would be made on keytypes, e.g.. steel plant and agricultural machinery, the effect would be to reduce by two-thirds the remaining machineryimports, thereby seriously retarding the economic recovery ofthe country. A cut of this nature on that portion of the pro-gramme which relates specifically to recovery would beregarded with disfavour by E.C.A. For these reasons the cutshould only be imposed as a last resort      ...      ...       ...      2010023. The impact of these cuts on imports from the dollar area depends tosome extent upon supplies from the non-dollar area, and is thus related to someextent to decisions taken in the light of Annex C. This applies particularly toraw materials; if it became necessary to cut Egyptian cotton, a cut in UnitedStates cotton would be the more difficult.  It is relevant also to wheat.Conclusions24.   The following are our recommendations : (i) The dollar balance of payments programme, on the &apos;&apos; budget &apos;&apos; and&quot; requirements &quot; bases, should be submitted to O.E.E.C. on the lines^S^1? this PaPer- and with covering memorandum as inU.Jr. (48) 178.(ii) In the interim period before the amount of E.R.P. aid is known andin view of the likelihood that we shall have to frame a new programmetor O.E.E.C. based upon a lower allocation of E.R.P. aid than is allowed in the &quot;budget&quot; programme, consumption and import policy should be in accordance with a programme of Si, 150 millions EE Paid, and m particular a choice of adjustments should be made in theimport programme accordingly.ANNEX BTHE COMMODITY PROGRAMMES, 1st JULY  1948^30th JUNE, 19491. The programmes for 1948-49 which we submit to O.E.E.C. include for about 100 commodities full particulars of United Kingdom production,consumption, stock changes, imports by source and exports by destination. these commodities are the subject of detailed examination by O.E.E.C.
2. Summaries of the returns which we are submitting for some of the moreimportant commodities are shown in Table III to CP. (48) 178. The submission of these returns involves forecasts of United Kingdom production and exportestimates going beyond the period covered by the 1948 targets.3. We have accepted a proposal governing the levels of consumption of food-stuffs and consumer goods, which was submitted to O.E.E.C. in the following terms : &apos;&apos; Levels of consumption of food-stuffs and other consumer goods shouldnot be higher in any country than in 1947, except where a higher level can bejustified on grounds of hardship or of increased productivity of labour.Levels should in no case be higher than pre-war.&quot;4. The status of these production and export estimates is not yet clear. our production exports to other participating countries of coal are regarded inUnited States as a yardstick of our recovery and of our willingness to assistEurope, and the figures which we now submit will certainly be regarded ascommitments replacing the Paris commitments. But in other commodities, it is unlikely that the figures will become elevated to the status of commitments.However, we have to be prepared for them to become so.5. The division of our own production between United Kingdom consumption and export, and between exports to other participating countries and exportsto non-participating countries is in general in these figures projected into 1949at the rate planned for the second half of 1948.6. The following are.points to which we particularly wish to draw Ministers&apos;attention, and ask for decision.7. Wheat. Our wheat programme shows 1948-49 consumption at.61 per cent, above 1947 and 4^ per cent, above pre-war. This may be embarrassingin O.E.E.C. for two reasons. First, our consumption per head is anyway higherthan other peoples&apos;. Second, we could not show this budget without puttingin a firm figure of purchases from Russia and Roumania; these would then beregarded as firm supplies available to us, and might even throw the canadian wheat into jeopardy.8. The figures in the table do not provide for lowering the extraction rate;nor do they provide for an increase in stocks above the present level. But theydo show consumption of flour at 103,000 tons a week the level of issue fixed bythe Cabinet in CM. (48) 41st Conclusion, Minute 2,. in connection with de-rationing of bread. We invite Ministers to consider whether this should notbe lowered to 100,000 tons a week a figure in line with the actual issues in theyear 1947-48. In the last few weeks, consumption has been running at about 2,500tons a week above the year&apos;s average owing to the potato shortage. The Ministryof Food state, however, that for administrative reasons a reduction in consumptionto 100,000 tons a week would not permit the derationing of bread and wouldprobably result in local shortages and bread queues.9. Coarse Grains. In our budget programme, the consumption of coarse grains is put at 8J million tons, compared with 6 million tons in 1947-48. this implies that we get 1-15 million tons from Russia and Eastern Europe i.e. newpurchases of 800,000 tons to continue deliveries under the present agreement.10.   Coal. A separate submission has been made to Ministers.11. Oil. United Kingdom consumption of oil in 1948-49 is expected to be approximately 2 million tons greater than consumption in 1947, although not much in excess of the rate of consumption at the end of 1947. The increase isdue almost entirely to industrial consumption of fuel oil and gas/diesel oil. Muchof the increase is due to the coal/oil conversion scheme, which although nowhalted will require a great deal more oil than in 1947. Consumption of motor spirit is expected to be down by about 5 per cent.12. The British oil companies&apos; programmes of supplies to participating countries show a slight reduction in respect of products, 6 - 5 million tons 1948-49compared with 7 -1 million tons 1947 and a considerable increase in crude7-0 million tons compared with 3-2 million tons.

ANNEX CTHE NON-DOLLAR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, 1st JULY, 1948-30th JUNE, 1949. Report by the Programmes Committee1. This annex deals with our balance of payments policy towards the non-dollar world. On this, we are required to make a very full statistical submission to O.E.E.C The technical problems of doing this are serious, and we have notyet established estimates which we can regard as firm for 1948-49 for the pro-grammes have&apos;not been fully screened. A balance of payments table is attachedto CP. (48) 178 as Table IV. This will require amendment in the next few days before submission to O.E.E.O The policy implications, however, are clear beyondreasonable doubt, and this paper deals with them.2. After the suspension of convertibility last August, our external economic policy, previously directed towards multilateral finance and trade, was perforcereversed, and replaced by a system of bilateral agreements. These agreements were designed to avoid payment of gold or dollars, and to permit trade to proceed at the highest possible level. In particular, an attempt was made rapidly todevelop imports (especially of food) from non-dollar sources, to compensate the lossof dollar food.3. This policy has been successful. The drain of gold and dollars outsidethe dollar area has been reduced to very small dimensions; the dollar deficit hasbeen progressively reduced with singularly little effect upon our food and rawmaterial supply. Indeed, consumption has not fallen to anything like the same extent as had been expected.4. But the recent trend of our import / export figures, and the forecasts for1948-49, sound a warning. The freer import policy which we adopted towardsnon-dollar countries, coupled with all countries&apos; desire to purchase outside the dollar area, is threatening to lead to a situation in which all currencies are that we should seek to recover dollars or the equivalent for that part of theBritish companies supplies to participating countries which would necessitate the purchase of dollar oil.13. Newsprint. Ministers agreed with the trade that we should fix thelevel of Canadian imports at whatever we could afford. Having so determined the imports from Canada, we should take account of the supplies available from united Kingdom production, Canada, Scandinavia and Finland and so determine the level of consumption in 1949. The effect of the present programme is to fixconsumption definitely on a four-page basis until at least 1st July, 1949, and toreduce our imports from Canada pari passu with other increased purchases of more expensive newsprint from Scandinavia. This is contrary to what Ministers have undertaken to the trade. The introduction of a five-page newspaper on1st January, 1949, would involve imports of a further 40,000 tons from canada and Newfoundland at a cost of $4 millions not provided for in the Budget pro-gramme. If Ministers decide on the course envisaged in the programme it willbe essential that they should put our position to the trade, and explain that inpresent circumstances (i.e., until the Canadian credit position is clearer) it is notpossible to envisage a five-page newspaper on 1st January. We recommend thatthe situation should be explained to the trade accordingly.Conclusions14.   The points on which decisions are required are : (i) Whether flour consumption should be reduced to 100,000 tons a weekinstead of the 103,000 tons proposed by the Ministry of Food,(ii) The problem of oil supplies to participating countries should be dealtwith as in paras. 11 and 12 above.(iii) Delay in the introduction of a five-page newspaper in the light of theCanadian credit position.(iv) Authority be given for commodity programmes to be submitted on linesof Table III to CP. (48) 178.
&quot;hard.&quot;   The export drive has progressed well.   But the expansion of our imports is threatening to outrun it.5.   In Table IV to CP. (48) 178, the countries are classified in four groups : (i) Non-dollar  Western Hemisphere  (Argentina,  Brazil, Uruguay,Chile). ^ &quot;   &apos;(ii) Rest of sterling area.(iii) Other non-participating countries.(iv) Other participating countries.Even in these groups, we cannot generalise.   But the following conclusions areapparent.Non-dollar Western Hemisphere6. Argentina is dealt with in Annex A; at present we are living on the pro-ceeds of selling the railways, but this will not be possible in 1949-50. With the others, we are in reasonable balance under our bilateral agreements.Rest of Sterling Area7.. During the last few months, the sterling area countries&apos; sterling balanceshave been increasing fast; from the end of December to the end of May, they roseby  135 millions. In effect3 the Dominions and Colonies have been lending useven more money, which sooner or later will have to be repaid by exports. this in itself is not a healthy situation; the balance of payments figures show potentialities-tially dangerous trends  1948-49 1947 Increase  millions      millions     per cent.United Kingdom imports ...       -724 -474 56United Kingdom exports ... 784 521 51Net invisibles       ........ 57 414-117 -r 88These figures give too favourable an impression. We have a large surplus with south Africa (normally financed by gold, but now likely to be financed by reductionof sterling balances) and a surplus with Eire. The total conceals a deficit withthe Colonies and a deficit with some other sterling Dominions. Moreover, we need a big current surplus in order to finance the flow of investment funds the financial counterpart of the development of sterling sources of supply; we need a surplus, also, to finance the reductions of sterling balances to which weare committed.8. The expansion of imports is largely in food  415 millions in 1948-49,compared with  262 millions in 1947; the rise is both in quantity and in price.Raw material imports are up less markedly, from  191 millions to  250 millions.9. The full effect of development of new supplies of essentials to replaceimports from the dollar area will not be felt for some time. When these newsupplies come forward, often at high prices, the cost of our import programme will rise substantially.10. Our exports are growing. But the level to be reached in 1948-49 isnearing the peak of the sterling area&apos;s absorptive capacity (unless we can change the make-up of our exports, supplying more capital goods-a process which wouldtake a long time to put into effect). We are thus moving into a potentiallydangerous position, in which unless action is taken we may be committing ourselves to heavy purchases without organising the means of paying for them.11. The position varies from country to country, and we do not consider thatit can be effectively handled by imposing a global limitation upon each Depart-menfs imports from the sterling area.   We recommend : (i) That the Programmes Committee submit an analysis in detail of 1948-49imports from sterling area, distinguishing between basic supplies and less essentials(ii) That United Kingdom import/export policy be worked out towards eachsterling area country (including Colonies), taking into account the long-term development of imports that we require from that country and her needs from us; this would then be discussed with the countries con-cerned, e.g., in connection with the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference.
(iii) In the meantime, we must  restore  full  Treasury  control.    the programmes Committee should take steps to limit all commitments to purchase for delivery after the end of 1948 as narrowly as possibleto those required to maintain the current level of basic food rationsand of industrial production.(iv) That, until it has been possible to take decisions on our future policyin regard to the sterling area, we should avoid prejudicing our freedomof action by the conclusion of long-term contracts even for essential supplies unless the case in favour of such contracts is overwhelming.Other Non-Participating Countries12. The same problem is arising in much more urgent form as supplies aredeveloped from other non-participating countries (Russia, Finland, eastern europe, Egypt, Palestine, Persia, Spain, China, Japan,- Siam). The following are the figures : 1948-49 1947 Increase.   millions      millions     per cent.United Kingdom imports ...       -304 -111 174United Kingdom exports ... 175 123 44 -Net invisibles       ......       - 46 - 46-175 - 3413. There is nothing in common between the countries in this list, but inevery case we are tending to develop a large deficit, which can be financed only by dollar payments or by the diversion of exports of scarce commodities; our exports of the latter would be quite insufficient to finance these import programmes as well as those of other countries.14. The particular countries which make this deficit are Egypt, Sudan,Palestine, Russia, Finland, Eastern Europe (i.e.. Czechoslovakia, Roumania,Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland), Spain, Persia.15.   The main features of the potential deficit are : (i) Egypt and Sudan.-Deficit in 1948-49 possibly  70 millions, attributablevery largely to the doubling of price of Egyptian types of cotton; butmilitary expenditure is also an important factor before the evacuation of Palestine, this was estimated at  12 millions in 1948-49.(ii) Russia and Eastern Europe. -The supplies which we are hoping toacquire from Russia, Finland, Poland and other Eastern european countries are some  55 millions in excess of the exports which we areexpecting to send to them. A temporary deficit with these countriesarises naturally from the trade for we buy quick delivery goods andsell capital goods in return which will not be delivered for a longtime ahead; the effect of this is, however, to mortgage future industrialeffort in order to secure consumable supplies now. Even if we had more capital goods available, however, the extent to which we couldsupply them, having regard to Article 117 (d) of the Economic Co-operation Act, may be doubled.(iii) We shall run deficits with others in this group, e.g., Spain and Palestine(oranges); these may be met by growth in these countries&apos; sterling balances, but such increases will have to be repaid sooner or later.16. Our trade with most of these countries is governed by bilateral agree-ment, and the position in each case is of course kept under ^continuous review.We call attention here, not to things which have happened already, but to whatis likely to happen if we try to carry out the import programmes which Depart-ments are considering.  Taking these countries together, the&apos; deficit is alarming.17. To induce countries such as these, which have neither traditional tieswith us nor an overriding interest in our recovery, to lend us money on the sort of scale which would be needed to balance the account is clearly out of the question.In any case, the position will be no easier in future years. It is clear that thesituation must be tackled, country by country, by one or all of the following-means : (i) Make payment in gold or dollars. Our dollar balance-sheet (Table I to cp. (48) 178) makes only very small allowance for such payments;it is doubtful, indeed, whether E.G.A. would permit us to make suchdollar payments unless we were prepared to draw down our reservesaccordingly.
(ii) Spare additional capital goods to these countries, at the expense of- Argentina (where the situation is much the same), the Commonwealth(i.e., the development of sterling supplies) or our own investment programme. (Obviously the tighter our import control for machineryfrom the United States, the more difficult this is; in any case switchingcannot be done rapidly).(iii) Forgo all or part of the imports. For Egyptian cotton this is particu-larly difficult; this, is the basis of our high quality cotton textileproduction and export trade; there is no alternative source of supply,except the United States (if the right staples are available);suspension of these purchases would be disastrous for Lancashire andfor the export trade.18.   We recommend as follows : (i) Our position with each of the countries in paragraph 14 above shouldbe re-examined in the light of the total position set out in this paper,and import/export policy be revised accordingly,(ii) In the meantime, no new purchases to be made from any of thesecountries, except where minimum purchases are a commitment underbilateral agreements, without special authority from the Treasury.Other Participating Countries19.   With -the other participating countries, we are moving into a positionof surplus, reinforced by the surplus of the rest of the sterling area, now becomingsubstantial: 1948-49 1947         Increase  millions   millions     per cent.United Kingdom imports ...       -379 -242              65United Kingdom exports ...         375 273              39Net invisibles       ......           70 - 49+ 48 - 18The difficulty with this group is that the imports which we receive are not, ingeneral, of high essentiality. It will take many years before we can build upsupplies of food which will substitute for dollar food. Broadly speaking, weare getting into reasonably good balance with these countries; we are still losinggold to Belgium and our position with Portugal and Switzerland tends to becomedangerous, but elsewhere our position i s definitely easing and we have a largesurplus with some of these countries, particularly France.20. We recommend that our policy should continue towards these countries on the present lines, but should concentrate upon increasing the supply of essential imports. No change is proposed in this policy until a plan has beenagreed for intra-European payments; when that has been agreed, it will benecessary to modify our policy with each of these countries accordingly.The Whole Balance-Sheet21. Taking the balance-sheet as a whole, including the dollar area, wearrive at the following position : 1948-49 1947         Increase  millions   millions    per cent.United Kingdom imports     ...       - 2,004 - 1,536            30United Kingdom exports     ...          1,600 1,098            45Net invisibles &apos;.........              69 -   175-   335 -   61322. The level of imports in 1948-49 is put at  2,000 millions, 30 per cent,above 1947. This expansion is partly accounted for by prices, and partly bygreater quantities; the quantity may be put at 10 per cent, above 1947, whilst the price level is 18 per cent, above 1947; prices from non-dollar sources are nowrising faster than prices from dollar sources. The switch from dollar sourceshas been remarkably successful; only 21 per cent, of this programme comes from there, compared with 37 per cent, in 1947.23. The level of exports included in these estimates is 135 per cent, of 1938volume; it is estimated, indeed, that over the year as a whole, exports will belittle above the present level.  The export targets provide for exports at the end
of this year at 145 per cent, of 1938, but current experience and latest indicationssuggest that it would be most imprudent for Ministers to base actual balance ofparents plans on the assumption that the export targets will be achieved.24. There are three main reasons for taking a cautious view on the prospects of further export expansion : (i) in certain cases, production is not rising fast enough.(ii) markets for a wide range of products are showing signs of saturation;the demand for our products, at present terms of sale, is failing oft.(iii) import restrictions in other countries, cutting out less essentials, areproving damaging to a large part of our export trades.Some of our exports will, of course, continue to expand; in particular it ishoped on present plans that our sales of petroleum products will increase very substantially in the next few years, thus partially offsetting the loss of our pre-warcoal exports. But we cannot rely upon the continued expansion over the whole front, which would enable the targets to be met.25. The estimates of our invisible income are more promising, and show tconsiderable increase over 1947, attributable partly to the reduction in Govern-ment expenditure overseas, partly to increased earnings on oil, and partly tobetter prospects in shipping and reduced net expenditure on tourism. However,these estimates are always extremely uncertain, and there is inevitably a sub-stantial margin of error.26. The global deficit is put at  335 millions about the same as the amountof United States and Canadian aid allowed for in the dollar programme; Onthese figures we shall not be borrowing more from countries other than UnitedStates and Canada than we are lending. But there is no net margin here for anyinvestment in the non-dollar world to build up the supplies which we need. Ourglobal deficit will be substantially less than it was in 1947, but we shall not beable to claim that our need for E.R.P. is related only to the world dollar shortageand not to our own inability to balance our accounts.Conclusions27. In this report, we have analysed the prospective situation by groups of countries.  Our appreciation is as follows : (i) An important stage has been reached in the development of our tradewith the non-dollar world, in which it is necessary to take stock,(ii) Since last autumn, we have been exerting strong efforts to increase our purchases from the non-dollar world.   These efforts, together with heavy price increases, confront us with a huge import bill for 1948-49.(iii) At the same time, our exports are meeting resistance, and may be approaching their peak level.(iv) In many parts of the non-dollar world, spectacularly in the Middle Eastand behind the Iron Curtain, but also in certain parts of the sterling area, our desires to purchase far outrun our ability to provide the sortsof goods required in exchange.(v) This situation will get worse, and may become critical, if steps are not taken to correct it. The non-dollar world can no longer be regarded as generally &quot;soft&quot;; at our planned rate of imports, some currencieswill soon become critically &apos;&apos; hard.&apos;&apos; This can happen over such a wide area that the acceptability of sterling is destroyed even in those partsof the world where sterling is still acceptable.(vi) It is, therefore, necessary to re-establish full control over expenditurein the non-dollar world, and to ensure that side by side with thedevelopment of new sources of supply goes the development of markets-forward ^ permit US to pay for the supplies, as they come(vii) This implies review of the long-term export pattern required, in orderthat we shall be able to supply the goods these countries want-as a regular long-term process,(viii) It also implies limitation of consumption in this country, both to avoid the need for imports and to release for export supplies which othercountries want. r^ c28. Our positive recommendations for dealing with the various eroum of countries are contained in paragraphs 11, 18 and 20. vanous groups ol
