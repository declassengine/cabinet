THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1948SECRET Copy No.CP. (48) 16425th June, 1948CABINETEXPORTS OF COMMERCIAL SCRAP FROM germany memorandum by the Minister of supply at the meeting of the Cabinet on 3rd June (CM. (48) 35th Conclusions,Minute 8), I was invited, in conjunction with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to prepare for the Foreign Secretary a note showing what quantities of commercialscrap were required from Germany in the year 1st July, 1948, to 30th June, 1949,what difficulties stood in the way of obtaining this scrap, and what suggestionsmight be made to the United States Government for overcoming these difficulties.The Cabinet took note that the Foreign Secretary would then consider how theUnited States Government might best be approached.2. The Foreign Secretary has, I understand, already had some talks withthe American Ambassador as a result of information given to the Foreign office at the official level. In addition, cables have been sent to Washington by theForeign Office on matters arising out of the export of German scrap.3. I have submitted to the Cabinet a paper (CP. (48) 160) covering thefinal report of the Scrap Investigation Committee in which I mentioned that Iwas preparing a separate paper dealing particularly with scrap from Germany.The Cabinet asked me to include in the paper covering the Committee&apos;s reportmy comments on scrap imports other than from Germany and on home arisings.I think, however, this point can be dealt with more appropriately in the present paper.Summary and General conclusions.   The main points in this paper are : (a) The scrap requirement for a steel ingot production in the United Kingdomof 14-75 million tons in the year 1st July, 1948, to 30th June, 1949, is 8-26 million tons, of which the minimum need from Germany is 1-07 million tons and thereal need 1 - 44 million tons.(jb) Of the total of 1,200,000 tons of scrap to be exported from germany during the year 1948-49, the present American proposals allocate 540,000 tons to the United Kingdom which, with an estimated yield of 460,000 tons of booty scrap, would give a total tonnage for the United Kingdom of i million tons. Inpractice, however, exports to the United Kingdom of commercial scrap are unlikely to reach the allocated quantity.(c) The limitation of the total quantity of scrap to be exported from Germanyto 1,200,000 tons and the American proposals for allocation are unsatisfactoryas (i) the United Kingdom share would not be sufficient to enable maximumsteel production to be attained;(ii) the scrap requirements of the German steel industry have beenexaggerated; and(iii) America&apos;s claim to scrap from Germany cannot be justified on economic grounds.(d) A central purchasing organisation should be set up in Germany to supervise the export of commercial scrap.35528 B
5. I propose to keep in close touch with the Foreign Secretary on all these points. It is clear that every effort must be made to get the maximum quantityof scrap from Germany as any failure to obtain at least our essential requirementsmust inevitably have serious effects on our industrial recovery.General Considerations6. Any consideration of scrap requirements must, in the first instance, bebased upon assumed levels of steel production within the capacity of steel-makingequipment likely to be available. Thereafter, the scrap requirement is assessed by deducting from the total of the raw materials needed the maximum quantityof pig iron likely to be produced with the available and planned blast furnacecapacity. Other factors, such as the supply of coal, coke, iron ore and limestonehave, of course, important influences but for this purpose these are assumed tobe adequate for the levels of steel production adopted.Scrap Requirements7. In the first European Recovery Programme year, i.e., 1st July, 1948, to30th June, 1949, it would be reasonable to put the steel output at 14-75 million ingot tons. This means a total requirement of pig iron, and scrap of 16 million ingot tons. The maximum quantity of pig iron for steel-making that can be counted upon is 7 - 38 million tons; the scrap requirement therefore is 8-62 million tons.To meet this, circulating scrap is estimated to yield 3 - 76 million tons, processscrap 1-84 million tons and capital scrap 1-8 million tons, i.e., a total homearising of 7 - 4 million tons. Although the present yield from home sources exceedsthis yearly rate it would be unsafe to assume a higher figure for the purposeof these calculations. We have, therefore, to import 1 - 22 million tons. Of this,it is expected that 150,000 tons will be available from sources other than Germany;this leaves 1 - 07 million tons to come from Germany.8. It is appropriate to add here that the analysis in paragraph 7 makes no allowance at all for stock-piling or for the expanding demand for scrap for thefoundry industry. On the other hand we hope to be able to increase the efficiency of steel-making which would reduce the scrap requirement by 75,000 tons.Nevertheless, I am convinced that 1 - 07 million tons is the minimum that we needfrom Germany for an output of 14-75 million ingot tons in the year in question,and, if we are to build up stocks and make allowance for the expanding demandsof the foundry industry, we should require 1-44 million tons.Present German Position9. In the German Reconstruction Plan, prepared for the European recovery programme, the German Economic Council in the Bi-zonal area undertook to export 1,200,000 tons of scrap during the first European Recovery Programmeyear beginning 1st July, 1948. Export deliveries are intended to start in July1948.10. (a) Without prejudice to the total allocation for the whole year, wehave agreed with General Clay, the United States Military Governor, thefollowing basis for the allocation of the first 600,000 tons : 300,000 tons to the United Kingdom.200,000 tons to the United States.100,000 tons to the highest bidders.(&amp;) General Clay has proposed, apparently on instructions from Washington,that the second 600,000 tons be allocated : 240,000 tons to the United Kingdom;240,000 tons to the United States;and the remaining 120,000 tons as may be decided by theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation.The Foreign Office is, I understand, discussing this proposal with theAmerican authorities.11. We have stipulated that the quantity allocated to the United kingdom under paragraph 10 (a) is to be additional to deliveries from existing contracts ofwhich the balance undelivered at 31st May, 1948, was about 160,000 tons.
12. Excluding outstanding; deliveries from existing contracts, the maximumquantity of scrap which the United Kingdom can get from Germany on the basisof the allocation stated above for the European Recovery Programme year 1948-49is as follows : Commercial Scrap  TonsFirst six months.........,     ... 300,000Second six months       ...      ...      ... 240,000540,000Booty Scrap  .- -  ..First six months ...      ...      ...      .... 250,000Second six months......      ...      .   210,000Total during the year 1st July, 1948 to30th June, 1949    .....      .......       1,000,00013. Prima facie, these figures suggest that our scrap requirements will be largely met in the year I94S-49.-but. in considering them, the following pointsneed to be borne in mind: (a) No contract has yet been placed to cover the first allocation for 300,000 tonsand all our efforts to that end have so far proved abortive. Now thatthe German currency is in process of being reformed the prospects are more hopefuL(&amp;) The German scrap industry is not in a condition at the present time to handle anything like as much as 200,000 tons a month, i.e., 100,000 tons for export and 100,000 tons for the German steel industry. Even if arrangements can be made for the supply of cutting and movingequipment and of additional labour, some months must elapse beforethe impact of these additional resources will be reflected in the outputof prepared scrap.tn (c) There will therefore inevitably be a considerable lag in the conversionof the allocations stated above into actual deliveries. On the basisof past experience, it is quite possible that deliveries for export willnot exceed 50 per cent, of the total allocations for the year ending30th June, 1949.14. The agreement reached with the German Economic Council that thetotal quantity of serap to be exported from Germany in the European recovery programme year 1948-49 should be limited to 1,200,000 tqns, and General Clay&apos;sproposals for the allocation of this quantity between the United States, theUnited Kingdom and other countries are wholly unsatisfactory for the following reasons : (a) they disregard this country5s overriding need for German scrap, whichis estimated by the Scrap Investigation Committee at 5 million tons during the next five years, if the maximum level of steel production is to be attained:(&amp;) the commitment entered into by the Germans to export 1,200,000 tonsof serap during the first European Recovery Programme Year is inadequate because:(i) excessive provision is made for scrap to meet the needs of theGerman steel industry, and(ii) there is no indication that any attempt will be made to expandthe capacity of the German scrap industry to increase the yield of scrap commensurate with the demand;(c) the claim made by the United States for 440,000 tons of scrap in thefirst European Recovery Programme year will endanger the prospects of the United Kingdom and other European Recovery Programmecountries fulfilling their steel programme as submitted to the Organi-sation for European Economic Co-operation.Future Scrap Requirements of the United Kingdom15. An allocation of 540,000 tons of commercial scrap, even if actuallydelivered during 1945 49 (which, as pointed out in paragraph 13; is at leastdoubtful) together with a possible 460,000 tons of booty scrap, would fail to meet our minlnuim requirements in that year by about 70,000 tons and our real needsby about 440,000 tons.35528 b 2
16. If, however, we take the calendar year 1949 the position is still less satisfactory. It is certain that we shall not be able to build up stocks in 1948,so that we shall have no: cushion on which to start the year 1949. If we assumed steel target for 1949 of 15 million ingot tons, the requirements are as follows :-M. Tons(a) Pig Iron   ...      ...      ...... 7-4(b) Scrap        ...... ... ... 8-88(c) Home arisings     ...   .  ...      ... ... 7-26(d) Imports needed    ...      .....      ... ... 1-62(e) Imports other than from Germany ...        -15(/) Total required from Germany  ... ... 1-47(a) German Booty Scrap     ...      ... ...        -21(h) German Commercial Scrap      ... .... 1-26If, instead of 1,470,000 tons from Germany, our receipts in that year are to belimited to 690,000 tons (480,000 tons commercial scrap and 210,000 tons booty scrap), we cannot expect steel output to exceed 14-25 m. ingot tons.17. In subsequent years when no further delivery of booty scrap can beexpected, the allocation of 480,000 tons commercial scrap would be quite inade-quate to enable the present level of steel production to be maintained and wouldcompletely rule out any possibility of increased production.German Steel Industry18. It is freely admitted that sufficient segregated and prepared scrap mustbe retained in Germany to keep German steel production in line with theEuropean Recovery Programme plan, but the estimate of the quantity required,namely, 100,000 tons a month, based on a steel production of 6 m. tons a yearseems to be in excess of actual needs.19. According to the report submitted by Sir John Duncanson to theEstimates Committee of the House of Commons in December 1947, the programmeof-iron and steel manufacture in Germany should make no serious demand onthe large quantities of scrap lying about in Germany and not yet collected bythe scrap merchants. Sir John Duncanson based his calculations on the levels of production envisaged by the Marshall Plan. Details of these calculations are shown in the Appendix to this paper.20. It is true that the conclusions reached by Sir John Duncanson were based on a level of steel ingot production in Germany of 4-075 m. tons in 1948,and 5-5 m. tons in 1949, but even if the output of steel in Germany duringthe 12 months beginning 1st July, 1948, can in fact be stepped up to the 6 m.ingot ton level, which seems very doubtful, the scrap requirements for that year from sources outside the steel works and the engineering and fabricating indus-tries should still not be greatly in excess of the large stocks already at the steel works and scrap merchants&apos; yards, and should not, therefore, make con-siderable demands on the new stocks coming forward from current collections.German Scrap Industry21. The assumed limits in relation to Germany&apos;s capacity to provide scrapfor export are based on the view that 100,000 tons of scrap a month must beprocessed for the German steel industry and that it is unrealistic to expect theGerman scrap industry to process more than 200,000 tons a month, which isequal to its pre-war output. This is not a view which, in my judgment, shouldbe accepted without further investigation, and one of the first tasks to be under-taken by General Loch when he takes up his duties as United Kingdom scrapco-coordinator in Germany should be to ascertain whether, if handling plant andcutting equipment, &amp;c, are provided, a greatly increased quantity of scrap couldbe handled by the German scrap firms, or otherwise, than is at present contem-plated. Further, the amount of processing of scrap for export might be reducedto the minimum necessary to enable it to be shipped which should enable theGerman scrap merchants to handle larger quantities. Such scrap would then have to be cut to furnace sizes in this country.United States Position22. I now come to point (c) in paragraph 14, namely, that there is no justification for an allocation of German commercial scrap&apos; being made to theUnited States during the first European Recovery Programme year of 440,000tons only 100,000 tons less than the quantity allocated to the United Kingdom.
23. If the United Kingdom * and the European Recovery Programmecountries are to derive any real benefit from the Programme, it is essential thattheir steel production should be developed to the maximum level of the resources available and &quot;their demands for scrap given priority over those of the UnitedStates. It is clearly uneconomic for America to take scrap from Germany toan extent which would prevent the United Kingdom and other European steel-producing countries from fulfilling their steel programme under the european recovery Programme.In any case, there are other sources of scrap of which America is much better able to take advantage than the Western European countries. It is believed thatthere are substantial tonnages (estimated, as high as 7 million tons) still untouchedin Japan and that as much as 1 million tons of scrap is reported in the PhilippineIslands. It has also been stated that there are very considerable accumulationsof battle-scrap in some of the Pacific Islands within the theatre of warlikeoperations. However that may be, there can, on general economic grounds, be no justification for America entering into competition for German scrap which can beused to better advantage for steel production in Europe instead of in America.Difficulties of Procurement of German Commercial Scrap24. Hitherto the main difficulties in the Avay of obtaining commercial scrapfrom Germany have been(a) the absence of any inducement (apart from the foreign currency bonus)to the German scrap merchant to sell his scrap for export, pendingthe introduction of currency reform;(6) the inadequacy both in actual numbers and in efficiency of the labour available to the scrap industry in Germany;(c) the lack of suitable transport and equipment for collecting and trans-porting scrap;(d) difficulties with the Joint Export-Import Agency on the subject of theexport price; and(e) difficulty with the American authorities over -.(i) the procedure for allocating available supplies between competingcountries, and(ii) the setting up of central machinery to supervise the placing of contracts and to ensure that deliveries of scrap are made inaccordance with the terms of the contracts.25. Some of these difficulties have already been, or are in process of being,remedied. The foreign exchange bonus has now been increased from 10 per cent,to 15 per cent, of the export price, the merchants share being 10 per cent.Currency reform has already been introduced. The Joint Export-ImportAgency&apos;s present arrangements for fixing the export price are satisfactory to us.The Agency have agreed to proposals of certain American firms, wishing to exportscrap from Germany, for the expenditure of 500,000 dollars on the purchase of plant and equipment without any restrictions on the use to which it will be put.My Department are examining the possibility of making equipment available to german scrap merchants and in addition are in consultation with the Board ofTrade and the Ministry of Food about the commodities which the Germanexporters may be able to purchase in the United Kingdom with their foreign exchange bonus. The procedure for allocating exports of German scrap is underdiscussion between the Foreign Office and the American authorities.26. A difficulty that still remains unsolved is the setting up of some central machinery to supervise the placing of contracts and to bring effective pressure tobear on the Germans to ensure that deliveries are maintained at the stipulatedrates and that no discrimination is exercised between the countries placing the contracts. The recommendation made by the United States Scrap Mission, that an anglo-American Corporation (or an American Corporation co-operating with itsBritish counterpart) be designated to operate as a central scrap purchasingorganisation in Bi-zonal Germany, would in my view be an effective method forattaining this object, and even if the Americans agree to withdraw or reduce their claim to scrap from Germany, I still consider that some central body should beset up with American support to supervise scrap deliveries from Bi-zonalGermany. The Foreign Office have already been given my Departments proposalsfor joint purchasing arrangements.G. R. S.Ministry of Supply, W.C. 225th June, 1948.

The quantities of scrap required by the German iron and steel industry from 1949 onwards are well below the amount of scrap which should be available through the scrap merchants from normal obsolescence and wear and tear. Theamount of scrap so available should be of the order of 550,000 tons in 1949, rising to 1 million tons in 1951 and thereafter.
