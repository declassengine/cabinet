Jamaicanswho are due to arrive at Tilbury on 21st June on the3.8. EMPIRE WINDRUSH,  I think it is desirable that the cabinet should be aware of the arrangements which the various Departmentsconcerned are making to deal with the situation.      I should,however, first like to explain the circumstances in whichthese men decided to come to Great Britain.2.      Circumstances of Arrival.      It will be appreciated thatthe men concerned are all British subjects.      The G-overnmeutof Jamaica, has no legal power to prevent their departure fromJamaica and the Government of the United Kingdom has no legalpower to prevent their landing.      This is a spontaneous, movementby Jamaicans who have saved up enough money to pay for their ownpassages to England,  on the chance of finding employment,  asthey are free to do now that Government allocation of berthshas been discontinued.     We do not know who were the ringleadersin the enterprise,  but I have asked  the Governor of Jamaica fora report on this point.      It was certainly not- organised orencouraged by the Colonial Office or the Jamaica Government.On the contrary,  every possible step has been taken by theColonial Office and by the Jamaica Government to discouragethese influxes.      Not only has the position about emplcyme:ioand accommodation in the United Kingdom been explained by meto the Governors in correspondence but a senior officer of myDepartment visited Jamaica and certain of the other West IndianIslands last year and made great efforts to explain thedifficulties at this end and to discourage people from comingover to this country on the chance of finding work.      There wasample publicity in the Jamaica press of the difficulties which men might meet If they came to England.      Before this party of hire? left Jamaica they were warned by the Jamaica government about the difficulties which would beset them on their arrival in this country,  but they decided,  as they are free to decide,to take the risk.      As I say,  the Jamaican Government has no legal power to prevent them leaving the Island,  and I doubt the wisdom of authorising a British Colonial Government to take suchpower in peace-time.    In any case, Jamaica has reached such an advanced stage on the road to self-government- that it would beimpossible  to compel them to legislate in this sense bydirections from London.      I do not  think that a similar massmovement will take place- again because  the transport is unlikely to be available,  though we shall be faced with a steady trickle,which, however,  can be dealt with without undue difficulty.The immediate point however is that these I4.I7 men are due t-c
arrive on 2xst June, and unless there is to be a public scandaland the possibilities of disorder,  some arrangements must besEade to deal with the situation.3-      Underlying Causes.      Until the economic situation inJamaica improves there is bound  to be a desire among many persons there to seel; work elsewhere.    The Jamaica Governmentis doing everything it can to deal with unemployment in a situation or over-population and high birth rate.      There areat present some 50,000 unemployed or underemployed in the island.    Some limited relief is given by the recruitment of west ma.xe.ns for work in the United States of America but mostexternal fields of employment no longer exist.      The problem is a long-term one and, for the constitutional reason given above,  the internal economy of Jamaica cannot be planned fromZiCndon.      The economic developments now going forward inJamaica are mainly agricultural and most of the unemployed oremen who are unfitted or unwilling to enter agriculturalemployment.     Work of the kind they want might be afforded by extensive industrial development but, even apart from the limitations placed on such development by the extent of thelocal market, we have hitherto found it impossible to get thenaehinery, structural steel and other equipment necessary for Tack development- on any large scale.     For example,  various proposals for cement production have all so far foundered onthat difficulty.      We&quot;have now the Report of the Commissionto British Guiana and projects are being examined in the hopethat some relief may be given by settlement both in british guiana and British Honduras.h.      Sise of Immediate Problem in United Kingdom.      The ColonialOffice it-self has no executive powers in the United Kingdomand must of course rely on the services of other Departments.The Colonial Office administers a number of hostels,  primarilybut not exclusively, for colonial students,  and can accommodateapproximately 70 of  these arrivals in their hostel in WimpoleStreet for a few days.      This hostel is,  strictly speaking,for- colonial Servicemen only,  and if the vacancies are filledup &quot;03- non-Servicemen there are likely to be protests fromServicemen who will have to use other Service hostels for thetime being.      But in view of the emergency this risk must betaken.      It may allay criticism to some extent if,  as I- intend,ex-Servicemen are selected to go to this hostel.      It isprobable that about 350 out of the hl7 will be withoutaccommodation on arrival,   so that some arrangements will have  tobe made for- the balance of about 280, for whom Colonial Officehostel accommodation is not available.5.      Measures Proposed.      The matter has been discussed betweenthe various Departments concerned,  and I think it is clearthat the problem has got to.be tackled, as one   outside ordinaryprovision such as the Poor Law and as a combined operation without too much insistence on normal departmental responsibilities.I need not recount all the possibilities which have beenconsidered and rejected as impracticable on one ground or another.      The most hopeful solution is  that the men should beprovided with transport from Tilbury to some central point which can be used as a &quot;clearing house&quot; or &quot;transit camp&quot;;    andthe liar Office have agreed  to make available for this purpose the Beep Shelter at South Claphara.      The immediate problem of accommodation is therefore met and arrangements to covertransport and food are    in hand.      This is not ideal,   butordinary surface accommodation for so large a number is apparently unobtainable;    and there is considerable convenienceIn having the men (other than the odd 70 at the Colonial Officehostel) all  together.
6. Arrangements are being made for the boat to be met by representatives of the Colonial Office and the Ministry ofLabour,  and the Ministry of Labour have undertchen to do everything in their power to help the men to find employmentin England as quickly as possible.      It is understood that someat any rate of the arrivals are anxious to join the Armed Forces,About two-thirds of the total arc- in fact ex-Servicemen.Many of the men will arrive with only a limited amount of funds,having spent most of their savings on buying their passages toEngland.      It may therefore be necessary to grant them publicassistance until they find employment, but there is machineryfor dealing with this particular problem through the assistance board.      They may also need assistance towards railway faresto  their ultimate destinations.      The whole matter is beingvigorously dealt with by the Departments concerned under thechairmanship of  the Ministry of Health.7.      Possibility of Employment Overseas.      The doors of Cubaand Panama are now closed and employment in the United Statesof America is very restricted.     These men want work inEngland.      v&apos;/e shall try to open out possibilities in british guiana and British Honduras.      There have been psychologicaldifficulties about employment in Africa and I ami informed  thatit is doubtful if these men have the skills that are wantedthere from  time to time.      But that problem will be exploredfurther though my present enquiries are not encouraging.Colonial Office,  S.W.  1.18th June,  1948.
