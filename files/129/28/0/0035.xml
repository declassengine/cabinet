215THE    AN&quot; ARC1&quot;1 T GRecent jjeyejlcrcmsnfcsAfter -Hie preparation of my memorandum (C.P. (HQ) I58of 21bt June., bat before there had been time for the Cabinet todiscuss ifes  the State Department Informed H.M. Embassy inWashing ton on 25th June that, being under pressure, fromArgentina and Chile to give the:;; advice in regard to their .dispute with us in the Antarctic, they were proposing withinten days tc put forward tc the Governments concerned a schemefor cn 8-Power International trusteeship over the wholeAntarctic continent ana islands south of latitude 60o (see mapattached),      rise State Department had prepared an aide memoireincluding a draft agreement- which they hoped would be- accepted as a basis Sot csiseusolon by the 8 Powers concerned,  (UnitedStates., United JEingdeiru Prance, ITorway, Australia, New Zealand,Argentina and Chile).      They said that in deference to theUnited Kingdom Government they had omitted the South Orkneysand South Shetland islands from the area to be discussed,  inorder that the United Kingdom, Argentine and Chilean governments could embark in the near future en amicable discussion of theirrespective claims in these islands and if possible reach asettlement before the next- Antarctic season.      They added that should the three powers fail to reach an agreement,   the UnitedStates Government might have to reconsider their proposal to exclude this area from the scope of the discussions for anc-Power Antarctic trusteeship.2, The State Department emphasised that they &quot;wished tomake their proposals known fee ail the participating powers atone and  the sane time&quot;,  ana they particularly asked that theAustralian and hew Zealand Governments should be kept inignorance of the fact that the United Kingdom Government had boongiven an advance cepy.3* On receipt of the united States proposals,  the ForeignOffice and the Colonial Office agreed on the official levelthat it was desirable at all costs, within the short period ofgrace allowed us,  tc point out- to the State Department theserious dangers involved in any trusteeship arrangement underthe United nations,  particularly having regard to the presenceof the U.8.S.B. on the Trusteeship Council.     Foreign office telegram to Washington Do. 7179, was accordingly despatched on 2nd July (Annex I).      It will be seen that the telegram made it clear that Ministers had not been consulted and that theDominion&quot; (Governments concerned, not having been informed,  couldnot be regarded as in any way committed.h. We die in fact respect the wishes of the State Deportmentand refrained frem informing the Austral! en and New zealand governments of the proposal,  but it subsequently emerged(Washington telegram-So. 3hI3 of 13th July (Annex II)j  that the -State lep-etftnent eonkhuziicat-ed their plan confidentially andinformally to the Chilean and Argentine&quot;Governments before taking account of our views and without informing the Dominion or otherGovernments concerned!.     We have,  therefore, had no alternative but to Inform the Australian, New Zealand, Canadian and UnionGovernments Immediately cf what has taken place,  and the UnitedStates Smbassr have been left in no doubt of our strong   objection-1-
216to Chile and Argentina having beaa coasulted in advance about a plan which involves the dispose! ot Iteifed Kingdom, australian and New Zealand territory.5. It is clear from WasifriPjgt-ou telegram Ho. 3kl3 that theState Department have been impressed foy our- arguments againsttrusteeship to the Chileans.     Iftpam a subsequent telegram itemerges that they have instructed their representative toexplain to the Chilean Government tbct, although, the- UnitedStates Government favour some torm of imtemationo.lisr.tion inAntarctica,   they have not yet mti&amp;G wo their minds between thetwo alternative methods of trusteeship oe&amp; condominium, andour Embassy have been informed fey the State Department that theymight be prepared, when putting the proposal formally to the seven other Powers,  to substitute a condominium plan for their original trusteeship plan.     A feu qcjb remain before they take this action.      At the same time we are informed that the UnitedStates are about to amiounee their gsh claims in the Antarctic.6. We are therefore faced with the necessity for givingour formal opinion on some kind of international settlement inthe Antarctic and it is desirable that the Cabinet should forma view on the main points which arise.RECOIlMEHDAT IONS7. The recommendations in this paper are as follows -(a) that the Cabinet approve tine line adopted in the telegram sent to Washington Mo. 7179 of 3rd July(Annex 1);(b) that the Cabinet authorise ee te enter into negotiations with the other seven Powers, at the invitation of the United States Government, witha view to the formulation of a plan for the pooling of Antarctic territory under a joint 8-Poweradministration, provided always that this does not take the form of trusteeship or- involve placing theterritory in any way under&apos; the authority of theUnited Nations.      The fullest possible co-operation and  association with appropriate United Nationsbodies would of course be recommended;(c) that we should endeavour to secure from the other interested Governments recognition of British-sovereignty over a limited area in the South Shetlands,including Deception island;    if necessary allowingArgentina and Chile in return to retain some tokenisland or islands:(d) but that,  if it is found necessary in order to ensurethe success of the 8-Power discussions,  we should beprepared in the final resort to- throw the whole ofthe Falkland Islands Dependencies south of latitude60o into the common poo!, provided all the other powers did the same in regard to their territories^(e) that we should inform the Australian and New zealand governments of our views as above and encourage themto take a similar line in regard to their territoriessouth of 60o.BASIS OF TEE PROBLEM8. The Cabinet will be aware from CP. (Ll3)  158 of the
217dilemma in which we find ourselves in view of the argentine and Chilean encroachments on the one side and on the otherour own unwillingness to maintain by force our position inthe Falkland Island Dependencies.      The proposal put forward in my previous paper, now withdrawn was that- an attempt shouldbe made t-o reach an agreement with Argentina and Chile by direct negotiation,  leaving the possibility of an internationalsolution in the background as a resort in case of failure.     at best,  it did not seem &quot;very probable that these discussions wouldbe successful, and the prospects have not- been improved by the continuous public attention which the Argentine Government havebeen drawing to their claims in recent months.     The appearance of a new United States plan, which would lift the dispute ontoa wider,  international plane,  therefore, seems t-o offer a ?/elcomemeans of escape from the embarrassment and loss ef prestigewhich would certainly result either from protracted disagreement with Argentina and Chile or from surrender of territory directly to those nountrieo.\ADVANTAGES OF AN 8-POWER SETTLEMENT9* Among the advantages from the British point of viewof such a scheme would be the following -(a) Under an 8-Power regime the Commonwealth would commandthree votes and could probably count in most matters on thesupport of the French and the Norwegians,  thus having a majority.On the other hand nothing could be done to our detriment by the argentines-or Chileans without the support of the United Statesand at least two British or European powers.(b) The removal of Antarctic exploratory activity fromthe sphere of politics would restore to us the advantage whichwe have traditionally enjoyed and earned in the course of thelast- 100 years as the country with the greatest practical experience and technical knowledge of conditions both in the dependencies and elsewhere on the Antarctic continent.      In the sphere of practical scientific activities our influence onthe policy of the proposed joint administration might for thisreason be expected to be paramount.(c) Experience in the past has shown that- international co--operation in polar exploration Is not only practicable,  but has achieved notable success provided politics have not been allowed to intrude.      The new arrangement may be expected toprovide ideal conditions for friendly co-operation in theAnt-arctic with the Americans as well as our former rivals the argentines and Chileans,  should the latter decide thatexploration   without politics is still worth their time.(d) The -present atmosphere of political tension,  if allowedto continue, might bo expected to encourage the contravention ofthe international fishery regulations.     A joint- administration should facilitate agreement- on controls in particular for shorewhaling and sealing.(e) The main purely British economic interest in the area is the maintenance of our occupation, if possible, as sovereignsbut in any case as tenants, of Deception Island where a Britishwhaling company proposes shortly to renew its operations and where a certain amount of capital equipment still remains fromearlier operations.      Our security of tenure could be safeguarded by the proposed scheme in either of its forms, and this would encourage the company, which Is at- present hesitating in view of
the political uncertainty,  to establish a whaling station onthe island.10. Our first conclusion,  therefore, is that His majesty&apos;sGovernment should welcome in principle the initiative of theState Department, subject to the warning already given themregarding the dangers of trusteeship and our strong preference for a condominium, -or pooling of territory under joint-administration.      It follows from this that- we should recommend the proposal t-o the favourable consideration of the australian and New Zealand Governments, whose Antarctic territories wouldalso be involved and who would of course be amongst- the eight-Powers of the condominium.We should also consult- the Union Government in view oftheir whaling interests and the Canadian Government sincedevelopments in the Antarctic may Weil have repercussions ontheir Arctic interests.SOUTH SHETLANDS AND SOUTH ORKNEYS11. The Foreign Office and Colonial Office felt, further-more,  that- the chances of reaching a separate agreement with argentina and Chile over so small an area as the South Shetlandsand South Orkneys groups alone (as suggested by the state department) would be even less favourable than if the whole ofthe Falkland Islands Dependencies had been available fordivision.      It was therefore felt that British interest- would bebetter served if the whole area could be dealt with within the framework of 8-Power discussion.      It- seemed to be clear thatif we were forced to surrender any part of our claims in thearea,  it would be preferable for them to be placed under thecontrol of an international body of which we were a member than to see them pass t-o another individual nation.      It; was thereforeagreed that we should abandon the idea of separate 3-Powerdiscussions with Argentina and Chile and decline the Americanoffer to leave certain islands out- of their plan for this purpose.The Colonial Office&apos;felt strongly,  however,  that an attempt shouldbe made to retain British sovereignty at least over a portion ofthe South Shetlands Island,  including Deception Island, and a reservation to this effect&apos;was accordingly made in the telegram to Washington (paragraphs 5 and 6).      The Secretary of State forthe Colonies feels that- on political grounds this point of viewshould be maintained.     He has pointed out that the abandonment of sovereignty, even to an international pool, over british colonial territory will require very careful handling and thatwhile it may be possible to justify putting the greater partof the (uninhabited) Falkland Islands Dependencies south cf 60ointo a condominium for joint- administration with other Powers,it would be going too far to surrender everything south of thatline,  bearing in mind the very considerable contribution we arebeing called upon t-o make to the territories under the proposedcondominium.12. There is certainly much force in this point and it- isclearly right that- in the first stages of any discussions withother powers we should endeavour to hold out for the retention ofBritish sovereignty over this limited area.      As will be seen fromthe  telegram to Washington, No.  7179.  v/e have made this proposalto the State Deportment coupled with the suggestion that- wewould not object- if the Argentines made a similar reservationin respect- of Laurie Island where the Law Officers consider theyhave established some sort of a title.      The first reaction ofthe State Department was that- this was a reasonable request- onour part.      (Alt-hough we did not mention this,  it might- also be
219necessary to allow the Chileans some small concession such forexample as the retention of Greenwich Island where,  though theirtitle is extremely dubious,  they have established an occupiedPOSt).13. It is possible that some arrangement on these linesmight be acceptable to the Powers concerned but we must beprepared to find the Argentines and Chileans extremely reluctant to recognise British sovereignty over what is in effect the keygroup of islands in this sector while their claims (with veryminor exceptions)  are wholly absorbed into the condominium.B/Icreover,  even the Dominion Governments and possibly also theFrench end Norwegian Governments might argue that if the UnitedKingdom can make exceptions,  they can do so too,  and the result might be a general contracting-out by all claimants in respectof the areas to which they attach importance, and a consequentbreakdown of the 8-Power discussions.      In order, to avoid this,and in order to secure a satisfactory general settlement of the antarctic problem on an 8-Power basis,  the Cabinet is asked toagree that we should be prepared,  in the last resort,  to includethe whole of the Falkland Island Dependencies south of latitude-so in the international scheme.      Provided  that the 8-Powerarrangement were satisfactpry to us in other respects and gave us freedom for our whaling and scientific operations,  it shouldnot be essential on political or other grounds, to hold out forthe retention of British sovereignty in a small enclave.ATTITUDE OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALANDHi. The Cabinet will see from the attached map that Australiand New Zealand claim very large sectors of Antarctic territory,together comprising very nearly a half of the total continentalarea.      It is true that they have not- as yet established anypermanently occupied posts on this territory and their record ofexploration is not to be compared with our own in the DependencieBut- we have recently encouraged the Australian Government to takea more active interest in their Antarctic territory and they arenow making active preparations for more intensified explorationin the coming season.      They will not willingly accept any arrangements which might interrupt these plans and we must,therefore, expect to meet with .initial opposition from australia to the whole idea of an international regime.     However, it doesnot- necessarily follow in practice that an international.vegimeof the kind proposed need interfere with Australian activities in their sector, which is not claimed by any other Power,  and Itmight be possible to persuade them that their long-term interestsand their immediate plans could, be best- served by agreeing tojoin in the 8-Power discussions.      The New Zealand Governmentis understood to be on the whole favourably disposed to aninternational solution.      Nothing is known at present- of theprobable attitude of the French and Norwegians, beyond the factthat they are planning expeditions for the near future and may inconsequence be disinclined to fall in with the American proposals the FALKLAND ISLANDS AND SOUTH GEORGIA15. It will be appreciated that even if the whole of the antarctic problem can be solved by means of an internationalscheme we shall still have on our hands the long-standingdispute with Argentina over the Falkland Islands themselves andSouth Georgia, which lie north of 60o latitude.     Here, however,it is a quest-ion of inhabited territory in which the Argentinescould never put down landing parties except with- the intention ofinvading the colony and&apos;consequently,  presumably, of fighting a
Foreign Office, -3.;/. I.,July, 1948.war against the United Kingdom.     Thus the position there i,snot parallel with that- in the Antarctic and there is no need to suppose that acceptance of an international Antarcticregime would weaken our position in the Falkland Islands.On the contrary, a generous contribution towards &quot;internationalism1in Antarctica should if anything strengthen the sympathy whichwe would enjojr in the United States and elsewhere in standingfirm in our possession of the Falkland Islands and other western Hemisphere colonies such as.British Honduras.
221ANNEX IGoto- of Telegram fNo. 7179) from ForeignOffice to Washington elated 2nd July. J.9U.8.Your telegrams Nos. 3D+9, 3150 and 3151, United states proposals for settlement in the Antarctic.The State Departments proposals for United Nationstrusteeship in Antarctica have been carefully considered herein consultation with the Colonial Office, commonwealth relations Office and Ministry of Defence.      The views set outin the following paragraphs (which must be taken as provisionalsince there has not yet been time for Ministerial consultation)accordingly take into account all the factors in the situation as seen from the United Kingdom point of view.      In view, however,of paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 31k9 we have not informed the Commonwealth Governments concerned.      From earlierconsultations which we have had with Commonwealth Governmentswe have reason to think that the Australian Government at leastwould be definitely opposed to any international settlement-involving abandonment of Australian sovereignty over theirsector.      In communicating these provisional views t-o the state department you should,   therefore, be careful to emphasise (a)that they cannot be regarded as committing the commonwealth governments in any way,  and (b) that the United Kingdom government cannot- commit themselves at this stage as to the final views theymight adopt after consultation with the Commonwealth Governments.2. Subject to this,  we welcome in principle the initiative of the United States Government in seeking settlement of the antarctic problem and appreciate the opportunity which has beengiven us to comment before the other Governments are informed.Our first and most important comment is that,  as you point out,any settlement involving United Nations trusteeship contains very grave dangers.      The objections set- out- in your telegram No. 3131all appear t-o us to have force, but the most serious of all inour opinion is that such an arrangement would give the Russians,as member of the Trusteeship Council,  an opportunity to interfere in Antarctic matters.3* While we do not rule out the possibility of some form ofco-operation or association with the United Nations and suchSpecialised Agencies as may be concernedwe see very serious objection to any arrangement under which responsibility for theinternational- organisation would pass to the United Nations.We should therefore infinitely prefer an 8-power Condominium,which was in fact at one time the plan formed by the state department it-self (your telegram No. 1005),h.. Further thought- is being given to the whAle subject butin view of - the lack of time at- our disposal we feal that themost important immediate objective should be to ensure that theState Department do not commit themselves in their forthcomingcommunication to other Governments,  to any particular form ofinternational solution (unless it v/ere a Condominium), andparticularly not to the trusteeship solution,     YQu should,therefore,  invite their immediate attention t-o the dangers of trusteeship and urge them at the very least to couch their approach to the other Governments in much more general terms.5* So far as the Falkland Islands Dependencies are-1-
222concerned, while we appreciate the motives of the United StatesGovernment in suggesting the exclusion of the South Orkneysand the South Shetland Groups in order to enable us to reach aseparate agreement with Argentina and Chile, we do not feel thatin practice the attempt to divide up so small an area would have-any chance of success.     We for our part should certainly haveto insist on the retention at least of Deception Island and king George Island and probably of others,  and we could not expect the Argentina and Chilean Governments to agree to this unless they received equivalent concessions elsewhere, as for example in the islands off Graham Land, where they have already, set upbases.     We should, therefore, have all the trouble andembarrassment of separate negotiations with these two countriesv/ithout any likelihood of a settlement.      Moreover, since putting forward the proposals contained in the enclosure to south american Departments letter to Mr. Hadow we have (for yourstrictly confidential information) received a fresh appreciationfrom the Chiefs of Staff who now attach very much less strategic importance to the harbours in the South Shetlands and SouthOrkneys groups.      In the circumstances we are prepared to agreeto the inclusion of both these groups in any internationalsettlement of the Antarctic which is acceptable to us on other grounds with the following reservation;    that we would wish to exclude certain islands of the South Shetland Group where ourtitle is in our opinion indisputable and. where we should not be willing to abandon our sovereignty except as a result of an unfavourable decision by the Court of International Justice.You might mention to the State Department that if the argentine government wish to make a similar reservation in respect ofLaurie Island we for our part should see no objection.     for your information the area to which this reservation applies isthe South Shetlando other than the Elephant and Clarence group.6. Amongst the provisions which we should wish to securein any international regime would of course be the right; tocontinue our whaling and sealing activities in the Dependenciesand in particular to re-open the shore station on deception island.      Any international settlement would have to includesatisfactory provisions for control of whaling and administration.We should also wish to see provision made in the internationalregime for freedom of access for scientific activities of allthe participating nations.     We   would naturally continue tooffer all similar rights in the areas remaining under oursovereignty.7* I hope that the offer   In paragraphs 5 and 6 above mayappeal to the State Department as a proof of our willingness notto press our purely national interests for the sake of a widerinternational settlement, which is the main aim of their initiative,  and may make it easier for them to accept our pointof view on the nature of the organisation to be set up.
223ANNEX    IICOPY OF.TELEGRAM NO.  34-15 FROM washington to FOREIGN OFFICE DATED 13TH JULY.  19UTTYour telegram No. 71/9 Antarctica.On receipt of your telegram on eve of kth Julyweekendj, Balfour immediately communicated views contained init to Hickerson, impressing on him our hope that UnitedStates would abandon trusteeship proposal.   Aide memoire-was presented to state Department the same afternoon.Official to whom it was given offered no comment at the time.2. On being pressed for reactions of State DepartmentHulley finally asked Me ado and S abb on Clare to call on12th July.    He told them that State Department regarded your views and suggestions as most constructive.   He admitted that state Department had long hesitated between idea ofcondominium or trusteeship and had recognised that ourobjections to trusteeship were well founded.    He added that state Department saw no objection to idea of exclusion ofcertain islands claimed by United Kingdom.3* But Hulley then revealed that Green of state department had left for South America on nth July as Chileanand Argentine Government had apparently been pressing UnitedStates Government to send an official to discuss Antarcticproblems with them.h. Embassy representatives expressed great surpriseat not having been informed of proposed action and were evenmore shocked when Hulley went on to say that Green hadinstructions to present a note to Chilean and ArgentineGovernments proposing trusteeship agreement,  text of whichwas sent in my telegram No. 3150.5* Hulley replied that,  in deference to UnitedKingdom&apos;s view, State Department had inserted the following paragraph in their covering note -    &quot;the United States hopes that the interested nations vail endeavour to agree on some form of internationalisation of the area.    In order to providea basis for discussion a plan for an international trusteeshipof the area has been prepared.   However the United States will welcome suggestions from Chile (Argentina) and will gladlydiscuss any alternative proposals1&apos;.    He argued that thisleft the &amp;oop open for any alternative form of internationali-sation.6. Embassy representatives replied that it appearedonly too likely that trusteeship might well appeal strongly to both Argentina and Chile, and that it was most unfortunate that this formula was being presented to them.    Itiwould nowbe for more difficult to persuade them to discuss some alternative proposal if they thought that United Statesfavoured trusteeship idea.    Embassy representatives stressedchange which had taken place in Trusteeship Council now that Russia had taken her seat and asked whether Sayre, or-Gerig (Chief of Dependent Areas Division) had been consulted.Hulley confessed that he had neither consulted them nor evenknew Gerig*-1-
7. After remarking that United States proposals had he feared already &quot;been coraaunicated. to Chilean Government,Hulley promised to try and obtain State Department agreement to the dispatch of urgent instructions to Green who was notduo in Buenos Aires until the Ihth,  to modify note he would present to Argentine Government in order to omit specific reference to trusteeship.   He also undertook to see if anything could, be done to submit a revised note to theChileans.8. Embassy representatives expressed particularconcern at South American Countries having been consulted in advance of other interested, powers.   Kulley&apos;s attention was drawn to unfavourable reaction which this would have onAustralia and New Zealand, and hope was expressed that state Department, when they made their approach to all the interested poy/ers, would 2101 reveal that some of them hadbeen consulted in advance.9. According to Hulley, trusteeship proposal had been finally adopted by State Department because United StatesGovernment felt that it would be a mistake to bypass united nations he enquired, whether His Majesty&apos;s Government mightbe prepared to put forward some concrete suggestions forassociation with, united nations.10. In private talk later in the evening Balfourexpressed concern to Bohlen at line State Department hadtaken and invoked his assistance in securing an urgentreconsideration of the problem.   Bohlen who had not sofar been brought into the picture, undertook to interesthimself in the matter forthwith.    It was incidentally a surprise to Balfour when he drew attention to the Russianfactor tc discover that Bohlen was unaware of the fact thatthe Soviet were members of the Trusteeship Council.
