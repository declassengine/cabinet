JULY 1 9*48 -       190GABIH3TTHE ELECTRICITY PSAll LOAD PROBLEMMemorandum &quot;by the Minister- jof^ Fuel and power. In my Paper (P.C. (*4-8) 32 of 10th March 1 5*4-8) to the production committee I mentioned the serious results which were likely to arise from the fact that insufficient huilding steel had &quot;been allocated tothe generating station programme.    Since that date, as I told theProduction Committee on 2nd July (P.0.(14-3) 13th Meeting) progress onthis programme has &quot;been very disappointing.    Work on- sites has notproceeded as fast as was hoped and the effects of steel shortage inthe first three periods of 19*4-8 are now &quot;becoming only too clear.    Ishould add that estimates of requirements of steel have &quot;been steadilyrising and that although some increases have been given the gap between requirements and allocations is still large.2. The  consequence is that the figures for- commissioning of newgenerating plant published in the White Paper last December  (Gmd.7268)cannot now be achieved.    The following taole shows the change in theprospect.Estimated Margin of generating plant available to meet peakdemand in a winter with soyore weather but with gooddomestic solid fuel supplies:Present estimates (assumingUnder White Paper Programme    increased steel supplies forCmd. 7268 installations in 1550 and later years1SU8/14-9 - 1U83 megawatts - I5S0 megawatts15*45/50 -   75*4 &quot; - 206o1550/51 -    30h &quot; - 18201551/52 -    15*4 &quot; - 130015 5 2/53 +   5*42 &quot; -    7601553/5*4 . -     70155*4/55 . 4-   5*40 :iIt was estimated last winter, making the same assumptionabout weather conditions and fuel supplies, that the size of the gap (before allowing for the effect of load spreading by industry)would be about 1,700 megawatts.It will be seen therefore that for the nest three wintersthere will be little if any improvement and that unless peak demandcan be reduced, heavy load shedding will he almost certain.     Thesituation was reported to the production Committee at its last meeting and the Economic Secretary, Treasury was invited to review the progress made in the electricityi. power station programme and to circulate a report on the position /?. C. (*48) 13th Meeting, Minute3(2)/.3. Meanwhile steps are already in hand to repeat the successfulspreading ci  load by staggering working hours.     But it has &quot;beenmade clear by employers and employees alike that they are notprepared to make the sacrifices imposed by these arrangements unlessother sections of the community contribute their fair share.     plans are being worked out in the Regions for the spreading of load by commercial and office users.     But the domestic user cannot beSIitIIII
191covered in this way and it is the domestic load above all thatis the most obdurate and has shown the greatest r elative increasesince the War.lim Last February I appointed a Committee under theChairmanship of Sir Andrew Clow to investigate the problem of transferring non-industrial demand from the peak periods.    I attach as an Appendix a summary of the conclusions andrecommendations of their report, which is now being printed.The Committee make several recommendations concerning the installation of special equipment which might be useful fordiverting consumption off the peak.    I propose to ask theBritish Slectricity Authority to study those recommendations andto give effect to them wherever possible.    But we cannot look toremedies of this kind for any assistance during the coming winter,since it is out of the question in any case to instal thenecessary apparatus on a large enough scale in time.5. There is only one recommendation in the Report that can have any appreciable effect next winter.    This is a proposal thatthe running charges of two part domestic tariffs, and so far aspracticable other similar rates to non-industrial consumers,should be increased during the three winter months, December,January and February, and reduced during the remaining nine months of the year, the changes being adjusted so that as nearly as possible the revenue of Area Boards remains unaltered.6. As the Committee saw, if this proposal is to be effective in reducing peak demand, it must provide for a substantialdifference between winter and summer rates.    In view of themultiplicity of domestic tariffs,  the Area Boards will have towork out the detailed changes appropriate to these tariffs.    Inthe case of the ordinary domestic two part tariff, the averagerunning charge for the country is ^d a unit, and the largestcharge in this that appears to be practicable is an increase ofTrd a unit in the winter quarter and a decrease of        a unit inthe remaining three quarters.    This would bring the averagerunning charge to about 1^d a unit during the winter and -gel a unit during the summer.7. It is impossible to forecast precisely what effect on consumption a change of this kind would have.    A&apos;here there are no alternative methods of heating, it is likely to be slight.   Butthe object of the proposal is of course, to induce consumers who can to use solid fuel in place of electricity for heating during these winter months when the load on the power stations is heaviest.It &quot;aims, for &quot;example, at inducing people to confine the use ofimmersion heaters and electric fires to the other nine months,while using solid fuel for space and water heating from december to February.    From  the  point of view of economic policy such an effect is certainly desirable.8. The financial consequences of the proposal upon differentconsumers depends not only on how far they can reduce their consumption in the December-February period, but also on how large a proportion of their total consumption of electricity occursduring that period.    This proportion for the country as a whole isone-third; an individual consumer who used one-third of his total consumption of electricity in the winter quarter would therefore not experience any change in his total bill for the year (fromthe. alterations in tariff suggested in paragraph 6) if either therewere no shift at .all in consumption from winter to summer or thepercentage reduction in the winter equalled the percentage increasein the summer.    Consumers will benefit from the price alterationsif they use less than one-third of their total electricityconsumption&apos;in the three winter months or if they succeed in reducing their consumption in the winter by a greater percentagethan they increase it in the rest of the year.
1929. The &quot;broad effect is that consumers will, tend to benefitif they use electricity evenly throughout the year, e,g. forcooking, wat erne a ting&quot; etc. , while those who use relatively moreelectricity in the winter and therefore do not get so muchbenefit from price reductions in the summer - i.e. those who useelectricity mainly for space heating - will be paying more.    Ashowever additional domestic space heating in the winter is themost important reason for the increase  in  peak demand it isprecisely these consumers whose use of electricity we should try to discourage most.10. Those who live in what are called &quot;all-electric&quot; houses,flats, and temporary prefabricated dwellings will -probably Lsdrirather than loso talcing the year as a whole, because of theirhigher electricity consumption in summer,-   Moreover, most ofthese houses have at least one solid.fuel burning appliance andthe effect of the price changes will be to induce them to relymore on this for space heating during the three winter months.In spite- of this there may be some protests from these people owing to the fact that even if they reduce their consumption for space heating as much as possible they may, onaccount of their high consumption of electricity for other-purposes, have to pay as much as 5/- a week more for electricityduring the winter.   &quot;And although this may be more than offset bysavings over the rest of the year some households may find itdifficult to afford the extra amounts in the winter.    I do not personally regard this objection as serious, but if my colleaguesfeel that it is, it could be mitigated by making the fixed chargeless in the winter and more in the summer.    I hope it will bepossible to avoid this however, because it is bound to decreaseconsiderably the effectiveness of the proposals,11. The Glow Committee Report will shortly be published andit is necessary to indicate the attitude of the Government toits recommendations.    In view of the necessity of reducingdomestic electricity consumption during the winter I suggestthat we should accept the proposal of the Committee fordifferential summer and winter charges for electricity,    whichhas already been approved by the Production Committee,  (P.C.(h&amp;)13th Meeting, Minute 3 (1 )) , and ask the British electricity authority and the Area Boards to put it into operation.    I also propose that we should give general approval to the other more technical recommendations and invite the British electricity authority to  carry them into effect wherever practicable.H.G.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7 Millbank,S.&apos;vY.1 .
193APPENDIXSIE-HvL:RY OF THE. CLOW COivlCETTEE report. The Report starts with an account of the nature and extent of the peakload problem and then goes on to consider means by which the demand of the domestic and non-industrial consumer at time of the peak demand on thegenerating system might be reduced.   Ports III and IV describe the types of apparatus by which this could be done and discuss the possibilities of usingany of them.   Parts V, VI and VII    consider the possibility of reducing demand by tariff changes either alone or in conjunction with special devices.   Finally,Part Mil of the Report contains the Committee&apos;s conclusions andreceasendations.2. The conclusions and recommendations of the Committee are reproducedbelcc?.Conclusions&quot;&quot;safe realise that, apart from the proposals regarding seasonalvariations in unit charges for domestic two-port tariffs and the extension ofnffisaas demand Setering for commercial premises, our recommendations can dolittle to alleviate next winter&apos;s peak load, difficulties.There are no instruments for measuring or controlling domesticeonsuaption of electricity at peak periods which could justify themselvesmerely as a short-term measure.    Only if they contribute to the long-termeconomy of the industry can the various devices, with which we proposeexperiments, justify their extensive application.    We believe that theseexperiments have considerable promise.In the commercial sphere we would draw attention to the value of full consultation with standing bodies whereby those well acquainted with commercecould co-operate on measures of load spreading which would economise in electricity at peak hours.    So far as industry is concerned this co-operation is secured through the Regional Boards for Industry and the numerous DistrictComsitteeSwho work with them.    We believe that an extension of these arrangements to commerce is desirable.In the domestic field we attach great importance to a furtherspreading of information and advice.   At present many do not seem to be fully as are of the difficulties which face those responsible for electricity supply,and of the fact that at least for the next two years it will not be possibleto Meet ail demands.    The utmost use should be made of the services of theSupply authorities1 Demonstrators, and organisations such as the BritishElectrical Development -association, the Electrical Association for Women andthe Women&apos;s Voluntary Services to bring home to householders by all practicalmeans the need for and the methods of reducing loads at the critical peaktimes.   When load shedding is inevitable arrangements should be made as far aspracticable to enable consumers to know in advance when cuts in the supplymight be expected.Since the fear of solid fuel shortage has been a potent factor in the peak load problem, an assurance to non-industrial consumers that futuresupiali^s of solid fuel will be maintained or improved would contributematerially to the alleviation of the difficulties next winter.&quot;RecommendationsQuotations from the Report are given in inverted commas, and underlined.A short suaaary of&quot; the relevant parts of the Report is given after e achEecossiend&amp;the.
-    194U&apos;K1) In the case- of domestic two part-tariffs, instead of a uniformrpjirdng charge throughout the year, the &quot;winter rate should be relatively higher and the summer rate relatively lower.     Similarprinciples should apply to multiple and block tariffs.,!The Committee reviewed various types of electricity tariffs at present in use for domestic and commercial consumers.     They appreciated that although thelow running charge of the two-part tariff gave consumers little encouragement to economise, it had been advantageous in promoting a wider and more varied use of\electricity and represented a closer approximation to the cost structure of theindustry than the Plat Sate tariff.     They were not in favour of changes in thetariff structure.     They recognised, however, the advantages of proposals not involving additional apparatus which can be put into operation at short notice and altered or withdrawn equally promptly, if found to be ineffective;withoutthe necessity for scrapping any equipment.     Moreover there is a large proportionof consumers whose consumption of electricity is so small that the fitting ofany sort of device, however, inexpensive, would not be justified.     The committee felt it would be quite consistent with the cost structure of the industry if the running charge of the domestic two-part tariff was higher in the winter monthsthan in the summer.     Although little is known of the response .of consumers&apos;demand to changes in the price of electricity, it seemed likely that such arelative adjustment of unit rates would tend to check extravagent use and promote economy in --Inter, which is the time of greatest difficulty.     TheCommittee rec0.gra.3ed that a change of this kind would not be 0.. complete answer to the present peak problem;    but even if it affects demand less at the timeof system peak load than at other times, it would tend to reduce the number of occasions upon which load shedding is necessary in conditions of plant shortage.The Committee emphasised that the chances of securing a reduction in winterconsumption would be much greater if the higher rate were restricted to o. 3 month period such as December, January, February, and not spread over the 6 monthsOctober to March.&quot;( )    The practice cf charging commcrcia.1 consumers on the basisof motored maximum demand should be extended&quot;.The Committee considered that the commercial two-part tariff has an advantage over the normal domestic two-part tariff in that instead of the fixedcharge being based on an -arbitrary quantity such as the size or rateable valueof the house, it is based either on the consumer&apos;s maximum demand, as measuredon a special meter, or on the capacity of part or all of the electrical apparatusinstalled on the premises.     Various types &quot;of instrument for recording theconsumer1 s maximum demand are in existence but the more accurate varieties areexpensive.     The Committee recommended the extension of this type of tariff for commercial consumers, but they did not recommend its application   to domestic consumers,&quot;(3)   Trials should be carried out on the follov/ing methods, in districts where centred control systems arc already in existence:-(a)   More extended use of central control of water-heaters;&quot;There are already about 110 central control installations of various kinds in the country and the Committee felt that the application of this form ofcontrol was a most promising means of securing some reduction in the peak demand.A signal sent out over the distribution network operates a switch in the consumer&apos;spremises turning off or on the whole or part of the consumer&apos;s load.      Themost appropriate loa.d   for control in this way appeared to be the storage waterheater since this can be switched off for short periods at times of system peakwith little inconvenience to the consumer.&quot;(b) The application of differential tariffs for &quot;firm&quot; and &quot;non-firm&apos;1I supplies, especially for space-heating purposes v where the consumerswiring installation is, or easily can be, separated.&quot;The Committee were interested in the possibility of offering a tariffinducement to consumers who were willing to accept, as an alternative to their normal electricity supply, a system whereby part of their supply (on a circuitto which the less essential appliances&apos;would be connected) was subject to central&apos;control and liable to be cut off for short periods at times of system peak.     Theapplication of this sysiemis, however, limited to cases in which the consumer&apos;scircuit is, or easily can be, suitably divided./ 1(o)
195&quot;(c)    The explication of tine-of-day tariffs to the larger dories ticconsumers&quot;.Such tariffs, under which the consumer is charged a higher unit rate duringpeak hours than during off-peak hours, are already in use to some extent inFrance and Switzerland.     The hours during v/hich the higher tariff applies wouldhe made known to the consumer in advance.     The additional apparatus required isa second meter, a duplicate of the one already on the consumer1s premises anda centrally controlled switch which enables the appropriate meter to be broughtinto action at the right tine.&quot;(d)   The application of load limiters at times of system peak on thelines of the Paris experiments&quot;.A load limiter is a device which limits each consumer to a pre-determinedcurrent by automatically cutting off the load or intermittently interruptingthe current when this limit is exceeded.     The main objection to this system isthe difficulty of finding an equitable basis on which to fix the limit for eachconsumer.     In any case the individual consumer&apos;s demand nay be more than twiceas great at mid-day on a Sunday as at times of system peak, and any effectivelimitation at times of system peek would therefore impose an unnecessarilystringent limitation at other times of the day or week, when there is no needfor restriction.   This latter objection could be overcome by using/a controlswitch in conjunction with the load limitcr in order to make the JtePVice operativeonly when the actual need to reduce the system peak load arises.&amp; scheme is being tried in Paris in which consumers are offered supplies at a lower price than their normal tariff provided they accept an agreedlimitation to their maximum demand during peak hours.     This limitation is effected by means    of&quot;- central control.The Committee considered that in assessing the results of all thesetrials the cost of installation and administration of the necessary meteringand control devices together with any inconvenience to the consumer mustbe compared with the alternative cost of providing generating plant to meetthe peak demand.     In this latter connection plant designed   specificallyfor peak load operation, such as the gas turbine, appears to merit consideration.&quot;(4)Research on apparatus with thermal storage characteristics shouldbe encouraged with a view to the transfer of some existing load tooff-peak periods&quot;.The Committee realised that the further development of forms of electricalapparatus with a capacity for storing heat would increase the proportion of loadto which it is possible to interrupt the supply with little inconvenience to theconsumer.     If supply to such load could be confined to off-peak periods, thiswould not only spread the demand for electricity more evenly over the 24 hoursbut would -produce a relative reduction of the system peak load.     such development would also facilitate the extension of the system of &quot;non-firm&quot;supplies referred to in 3 (b) above.
