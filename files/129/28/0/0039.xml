GOVERNMENT ACT,  1948 &quot;Memorandum by the. Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 18th March, 1948 (CM. (48) 23rdConclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet considered the effect on parliamentary procedure of the Bill for the Local government act, 1948, authorised certain immediate action for the present session, and invited me, in consultation with the lord president of the Council^ the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland, to consider what changes in procedure should be made for future sessions.2. This question has arisen because under the new system of equalisation grants provided for in the LocalGovernment Act, 1948, any change in the rateable values of alocal authority or any increase in its expenditure may resultin an increase in its Exchequer grant.   This means, under theprocedure which has obtained hitherto,  that a financial resolution in the House of Commons will be required to coverprovisions of any Bill, public or private, which eitheraffects rateable values or authorises an increased charge on local rates, unless, of course,  it also contains provisionsexcluding the expenditure from the calculations on whichequalisation grant is based.3. My colleagues and I are agreed that there is noreason to make any change in this procedure for ordinarypublic Bills - that is, public Bills other than the three classes of confirming Bills dealt with in paragraph 5 below.We therefore propose no changes in the Standing Orders of theHouse of Commons relative to public business.h. The combination of a private Bill and a financial resolution is, however,  so awkward, that -unless some change is made, local authorities will in practice either be unableto obtain spending powers by private Bill,  or bo forced toprovide for the exclusion of the resulting expenditure fromthe equalisation grant calculations.    This would in manycases be unfair;    it would bo equally undesirable, however,to exempt such Bills from the requirement of a financial resolution without a compensating safeguard for the Exchequer.We therefore propose:-&apos;(a)    No change should be made in the procedure forprovisions affecting rateable values.    In practice this will mean that it will in future be almost impossible to affectrateable values by private Bill.    In our view no harm will result from this.-1-
235(b)    Provisions in private Bills authorising rate-borneexpenditure should be exempted from the requirement of a financial resolution, but it should be an instruction tocommittees considering such Bills that whore a report made onbehalf of the Minister of Health or the Secretary of stateior Scotland so recommends, they should insert a clauseexcluding the expenditure from the calculations on whichequalisation grant is based.    This will mean that while itwill still be possible for local authorities to obtainspending powers by private Bill,  the effect on the Exchequerwill be properly safeguarded.Draft Standing Orders to this effect are given in paragraph 1of the Annex to this paper;    paragraphs 2 to h, contain certain minor consequential amendments to other Standing Orders.5. There are three classes of Bills for the confirmation of Orders which, although public in form, are similar incontent to private Bills.    These are:-(a) Provisional Order confirmation Bills.(b) Bills confirming Scottish Provisional orders under the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1936.(c) Bills, confirming Orders under the Statutory Orders(Special Procedure) Act, 1945*These Bills follow procedures analogous to that for privateBills.    It is equally awkward to combine them with, a financial resolution, and, from the government s point of view, this isquite unnecessary, since the provisions contained in theorders which, the Bills are to confirm are under the controlof Ministers, v/ho can safeguard the interest of the Exchequerbefore the Bill reaches the House.   All that is necessaryin their case, therefore, is to exempt them from the require-ment of a financial resolution.   This is effected by the amendments to Standing Orders given in paragraphs 5 to 7 ofthe Annex.6. If the proposals made in the two preceding-paragraphs are approved in principle by the Cabinet, it willbe necessary for the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to inform local authorities of what isproposed and invite their comments.    They will expect to begiven some indication of how it is intended to exercise thepower of requiring rate-borne expenditure to be excluded fromthe calculations for equalisation grant.   We suggest that theline should be that the power will not be used unless itappears that the proposed expenditure may become substantial,and then only if it is of a novel kind and not merely a new method of operating a power generally exercised by localauthorities.7. We therefore ask the Cabinet(a) To approve in principle the proposed amendments to theStanding Orders of the House of Commons relative to private business, as set out in the Annex to this memorandum;(b) To authorise their communication to local authorities,with an explanation, on the lines of-paragraph 6 above,  of themanner in which the new powers will be exercised.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I., R.S.C.19th July, 1948.
