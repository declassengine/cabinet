Although three months have passed since the studywas made the general conclusions are not thought to be affected..In particular the balance of payments statement in paragraph /is still broadly correct in its conclusion, namely that therewould be a gap to be closed in 1914.8/49 of the order of  370millions.      The paper assumed that though the United Kingdomreceived no aid other European countries would receive a small amount of relief.      The contingency to be considered now is thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government finds itself unable to conclude the bilateral Agreement with the United States while some at least of the other participating countries are unlikely to take this line.3. The salient points arising from this paper are asfollows:-(i)    Gold reserves in the interval since the paper was written we havebeen operating on the assumption that we would receive adequateEuropean Recovery Programme aid.      Our total reserves at endJune will stand at about  1+50 millions.      The drain duringthe first quarter was  11+7 millions and during the second quarter it is unlikely to be less than  100 millions, a total ofabout  250 millions for six months.      We may expect that the drain in the latter half of the year will be at a reduced ratebut it is unlikely to be less than  180 millions for the secondsix months of the year.      Consequently at the end of the year in the absence of any drastic measures the reserves would bereduced to  270 millions.      Naturally if no European recovery programme aid is received we should have to take drastic measures, but we cannot assume that the drain will be stoppedimmediately (see paragraph 5 of the report).      As we regard 500 millions as the minimum safe reserve,  and hove in facttold the Americans so,  the position would be one of the utmostgravity.-1-
(ii)    Consequences to the Home Economy;If all the methods of closing the gap dealt with inparagraphs 8 - 15 of the report were taken successfully (andthere must &quot;be doubts about the Sterling Area on which we commentbelow), there would, only remain something of the order of 215 millions available to finance dollar imports.      This would,mean cuts as follows:-(a) Iho further purchases of dollar tobacco.      The effectox this would be very grave and we might not be ableto apply so rigorous a  policy.      If we could not,additional cuts would have to be made elsewhere.(b) Abolition of standard petrol,  cut in supplementaryration,  extensive reconversion to coal and economicsin agriculture and. civil aviation.(c) Seduction of the dollar food import programme to canadian wheat only.      (in the last negotiationsCanada said that all the food contracts stood orfell together and we hove no means of being certainthat she would change her attitude now.)(d) .4 cut of about 12% in the total raw material import programme, but not spread at all evenly since some,e.g. wools  come wholly or in large part from non-dollar sources.      The maximum cuts in raw materials would &quot;be between 15 to 20 per cent of the home industry as compared with last half of 19h-7*(iii)    The application of these cuts is dealt with in detail in paragraphs 2b,-33 ond may be summarised as follows:-(a)    There would, have to be reductions in the rationsof tea, sugar (8 to 5 oss.), butter (3 to a littleunder 2), bacon  (to 1 oz.), cheese  (to 1  03.  andeven less) and cuts in eggs, meat and coffee supplies.The resulting calorie level would be in the region of 26?Q per day,  i.e.  a little below the level duringthe spring potato shortage and over 10% below thepre-war average (paragraph 26).(d)    I\Fg prospect of implementing the agricultural expansion programme insofar as it depends on imported feeding-stuffs (paragraph 27).(c) General restriction of consumer goods,  particularlycotton,  less paper for newspapers and books,  lessgoods made of non-ferrous metals (paragraph 28).(d) There -souid be extreme industrial dislocation,involving unemployment of perhaps as much as 1-g-million,  possibly more at first.   , Furthermore,  itwould not be possible to forecast in detail whichsections e-f industry would be affected and there forfeit is not possible to make plans against sucho dislocation.      It may take a considerable time beforerevised machinery to distribute reduced quantities ofraw materials could be got into proper working order.(e) Clearly some of the measures proposed could only &quot;bereally effective by having much tighter controls thanthose at present exercised.      Qualified staff toundertake these tasks could not be collected and organised for many months.
(iv)    Sterling Area DeficitThis is dealt with in paragraphs 10 and 11  of thereport.      The attitude of the Sterling Area would obviously be influenced by the circumstances in which the negotiation;;on the Bilateral Agreement with America broke down.      Thereis no assurance that many of the assumptions there made wouldbe realised.      In fact negotiations,  e.g. with India and pakistan support the view that they wool&quot;! not be realised.J+. I have no doubt that If we receive no european recovery Programme aid some of the consequences would not boprecisely those set out in this paper but we shall then boin the position that any alleviations sads under one headinghave to be met under equivalent cuts under others.      Thereis no doubt that the broad picture of the gap to be filled andthe methods to be taken to do it are as stated.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.1.23rd June,  19k 8.
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF RECEIVING WO E.R.F. AIDAi  introductory. The object of this section is to attempt to trace out themain consequences to the United Kingdom&apos;s economy if we shouldreceive no United States aid in 1948/9 or in subsequent years.This contingency is now remote.    It is however, impossiblefully to appraise the economic consequences of American Aid,outlined in the preceding sections of this report, without astatement of the alternative.    Moreover aid is not likely tobe adequate to our needs - our reserves will continue to fall -nor is its continuance beyond, the first year certain.    Thetendencies described in the following paragraphs are, therefore,of continued relevance to our fundamental economic problem ofthe short-term future.2.     What follows is not a plan,  or a set of proposals.    the changes  that would take place would be so complex and iritoxu-nrl-i,there would be so many uncertain factors, that precise forecasts are out of the question.    Moreover, much would depend on choicesbetween alternative policies.    These, we cannot anticipate:    wecan only suppose that particular decisions are taken.   But wehave attempted to   make our assumptions clear.3*     Assumptions.    To define the problem v/e start by assuming:(a) that, though the United. Kingdom receives no direct ail,the United States give Europe relief sufficient to preventfamine and unrest, but insufficient in itself to allow an;/further recovery of output, and any added competition with us for imports or in export markets.(b) that it is  outside our province to discuss economicdicisions with strategic implications which might well be&quot;necessary.    But we have assumed that we shall bo anxious toavoid any steps that would grossly affect the economic life orEurope,(c) that the countries of the Empire reduce their callson dollars and maximise their earnings  of them by genwons af tvu,- (..*of economy and production.Method of Argument.    As soon as  it became clear that we&quot;ere to receive no aid,&apos; we should have to make a set of drastic&quot;V-Vf-isn oixs which would produce rapid and largely unpredictablechanges,    For example, we would, try to&apos;&quot;break dollar contractsbut it is impossible to say how fast or in what way we could-o so; we would have to re-negotiate many bi-lateral trade-freements, but we cannot say pr^oisolr what our bargaining position would be;  there might be large and sudden changes inlorld trade and prices, but their direction is not easy totore cast.    We therefore, do not attempt to forecast the precisechain of events after the first series  of decisions.    Instead, weteve attempted to define a single position through which thesconomy would probably move fairly Soon and to describe what:;ould be happening at that date.
5.     Wo start with the present plans for the year 1948/9.(Those are in effect based on a tacit assumption of fairlyample B.R.P. assistance).    We have then supposed that wo have in a few months entirely to stop any further drain &apos;-on our soldand dollar reserves.This approach disregards three factors that would infact delay the decline of the economy:    (a)  clearly wo couldnot in fact -stop the drain on reserves overnight, and we wouldprobably have a few reserves still to lose.    But the draincould, not last long for the simple reason that the reserves are small.    (b) Stocks of food and materials could bo run down:but not for long.    (c) We might find,  if really pushed to it,that wo could sell a few more foreign assets for gold ordollars.    (This is a highly technical subject and it iscertainly not clear that oven short-period advantage could be gained, but certainly in precise plans for a &quot;non-Marshall world&quot;it would need study.;There are many imponderables,  the short term effects ofv/hich we have also had to ignore: induntrial unrest, malnni-vitioii,greater labour mob 1.1 ity, more realism and, therefore, more errorhamong managers and workers, and at a further remove changes inthe terms of trade and the volume of world trade.Prima facie therefore the broad assumptions made mayfairly describe a state of affairs v/hich without E.R.P. aid &apos;7eshould reach in a few months, say at some date in 1949.    the quantities given may therefore be thought of as rates at thattime.6fc      Section B shows the gap to be closed.    In Section C wc&apos;Tff.-!.u-ibe the big adjustments we have assumed to close the gap.in Section D we describe the consequences to the main sectors of trie home economy, and in Section E we briefly examinesome of the longer term or more indirect effects of the initialand more deliberate adjustments previously defined.B*    THE GAP TO 5E CLOSED7.      The following table gives an extremely rough estimate ofthe balance of payments with the dollar area (United Statesof America, Canada and American account countries)  in 1946/9.It uses the import programmes recently prepared (the &quot;X&quot;programmes)  to illustrate desirable imports on a continued basisof austerity.    The last two columns state the adjustments thatwe assume would be made, and the resulting rates of expendiand earnings on their completion (and before all the pewojiflor long; term consequences of these Ghrvnges worked oat).ureO irl a TV

METHODS OP CLOSInG THE GAP8.     A dollar gap of  370m. would have to &quot;be closed.    The problem^ould be to cut the various expenditures or Increase the variousearnings in ways which mads the total readjustment to the economywith the minimum dislocation.    To do this even roughly requires that we ta.ke a view on such questions as whether adequate food isMore important them full employment;  the set of adjustment assumedis therefore arbitrary.S, EXPORTS.

10, Sterling Area deficit;,    The sterling sores, deficit of  60m.is made up of a Colonial surplus of  rlGo, and a aoficit onaccount of the rest of the sterling ares of SLOOm.    The Colonialsurplus might be improved to  -50 as a result of the diversionsfrom United Kingdom and other soft cucteuiey consumption: coffee,rubber, tin and hardwood ( Sm8  or  9m,) sides, sisal, asbestosand non-ferrous metals  (another  la, or j, *    Diversions fromthe rest of the sterling area would also &quot;be needed.    Ten from india should yield an additional jSSel. 5  (although there arecomplications about the relations hip Ibetweeu Calcutta andMincing Lane);  fruit (mainly apples) from australia and NewZealand could yield another  5m,    On thus assumption that thepolitical difficulties were overcome, &quot;butter from. Australia andNew Zealand could yield nearly  20ma, vhich is one half thepresent rate of import from these two countries-, and whichwould involve us in a loss of two fifths of oar present supplies.11.     To stop this drain altogether another   Cm.a would have tobe saved from dollar imports into the rest; of the sterling area.To achieve this India and Pakistan in particular -would have to-be kept firmly down.   A plentiful supply of textiles would -be necessary:  the Sterling Area has recently &quot;been taking unitedStates textiles at the rate of about  SOnu a year.    Other exports from the United Kingdom would also have to he stimulated.    It-should be remembered that the attempt to xnapose excessive economyupon some Dominions might set up strong pressures t-owerds theirleaving the sterling area, or diverting supplies which we would wish to retain or dollar invoicing for their exports  to us.12.    G-old and Dollar Payments to other ^os-dollar countries,The aggregate figure for 1948/9 has of necessity been somewhatarbitrarily estimated,    It contains an allowance of  50m. for theArgentine - this being the approximate current deficit on the half year following - the end of our current agreement, -  10m. for germany and a variety of smaller payments for Sgypt, Persia,Finland, Belgium and so on.We shall have some dollar earning;?, frox interest, shipping,etc. that we could use without difficulty to continue payments ofthis kind, but we should probably not be allowed, in bilateral agreements, to convert a net surplus with, say, Canada (whichitself has a dollar deficit with the Iff.3.1.) into gold or U.S.dollars for other non-dollar countries.   We assume therefore that these payments have to be reduced to a trickle, &quot;by cuttingimports and expanding exports.As an annual rate in 1949 our Jirgemtine deficit may beestimated at about  60m.   We might conceivably increase exportsby  10m., though this implies a 25^ increase in a very short period.    Thus the remainder of the gap has to be closed by a cut of  50m.  in imports.
The stopping of the other drains would raise difficultpolicy decisions on Germany and on military expenditure inEgypt;    it would certainly require the most strenuous efforts to expand exports to Belgium, Finland and Egypt, among whichoil and capital goods would have to be provided.    Equally we might have to forego imports of the most essential kind -among them, timber,  cotton and. steel.13.      Oil Transactions.    The  55m. hero shown represents thenet dollar cost of oil now sold to non-dollar countries,.the dollar cost of the overseas oil expansion programme, and it includes also some  8m. for all United Kingdom military requirements.    We assume that no large reduction in tlielatter is possible.    The oil expansion programme is likely to yield a very high return in hard currency or hard currencysaving.    The major burden of reduction must therefore fall onthe soft currency purchase.sers of oil from United Kingdomsources.    By arid large this must imply reductions in european and sterling area purchases of oil (or-the provision of dollarsat the expense of other dollar purchases).    We have taken a figure of  20m.  as the saving to be achieved.    The measuresentailed would hamper European recovery and would therefore be only reluctantly taken:    hut the cuts in their consumptionv/ould not proportionately he very different from those we areassuming for ourselves (see paragraph 17 below);    and we mayassume that we should be able to increase coal exports as some measure of compensation.&quot;1&quot;   But we might have to faceindirect effects on our imports as a result especially of colonial and Dominion economies,11+.      The iterns of gold purchases and other items cover a wide miscellany of transactions.    We have assumed that by attempting strict control of remittances (including profits of subsidiaries, entertainment earnings, royalties etc.)restriction of selling expenses, etc., our earnings might beincreased by a small amount.15.      These adjustments imply that, after allowing forinvisible earnings,  all but  5m.  of our dollar areei export earnings of  220m, would be available to finance the import programme.    The currently planned rate of imports of about 395m, would have accordingly to be reduced by nearly half to 21 5m,16,      The allocation of those  215m, between alternative useswould be extraordinarily difficult.    The small total of  5m.for film remittances would have to go,  at a cost, which couldbe variously assessed,  to the amenities of life in thiscountry.    No expenditure is shown for 190,8/9 in Table I ontobacco,  since there is a current decision to malce no furtherpurchases.    To maintain present consumption levels when stocks are exhausted would in fact cost about  20m,  in United Statesand Canadian dollars,  and this would provide about three-quarters of total supply.    We assume that despite the gravefiscal and other implications of allowing consumption to fall to a quarter,- this would be faced,    (See paragraphs 2k and 28belowJ,^ The financial statistics of the oil industry are now being-examined and it is likely to emerge that the dollardrains used in the paper are rather too high.
17.     The 19k8/9 dollar-expenditure on United Kingdom civilimports of oil of  50m.  represents about half of total plannedexpenditure on oil.    At 15*9m.  tons,  these imports are substantially above 19u,7 figures,  (when stocks fell fast) eventhough they assume no basic petrol ration,  and no further fuel oil conversions beyond those at present in progress.    But they also assume that industrial Output would continue to rise,that the motor transport industry would continue to expand,that we should provide oil for the new oil using plantsnow being&quot; installed (partly as a result of Government encouragement),and that the mechanisation of agriculture would be continued.We have assumed that we could reasonably attempt a saving of  20m. in the 19^+8 programme or say 3-U million tonsof planned consumption.    This would involve (a) a heavy cutback below 1QLtf levels of motor spirit consumption,  includingnot only the abolition of supplementary petrol to privatemotorists, but a sharp reduction in commercial and transportusage:    (b) extensive reconversion to coal usage in industry;(c) a very tight control over agricultural-usage.,  and(d) proportionate economies in minor usages suoh as civilaviation.    Such a sharp reversal of current trends wouldinvolve temporary dislocation in important fields of industry,and a continuing restraint on industrial productivity.    Itwould also increase pressure on coal supplies and rail transport;    but this might be borne.18.      On present intentions we shall spend some  h.5m. onmanufactures in the dollar area in 19^8/9.    By for the greater -part of this is machinery ( 3h.m, ), and most of the remainderare &quot;goods for industry&quot; ( 9m.) - specialised manufactures,spares, components and the like.    Both categories are extremelydiverse - plant for opencast coal and agriculture are thelargest single programmes, and the rest is specialised plant for a wide range of industry.    As without E,R,P.  aid we mightfor some years be unable so-much as to maintain output on existing equipment with the imports of materials we could afford, it would be bad policy to use our resources to add toour total equipment.    We have, therefore, assumed that this expenditure might be reduced to  20m.19.     These outs leave  165m. available for dollar area food and raw materials.    The division of this reduced sum would present the worst of all the planning dilemmas.    Among thepossible alternatives, we have chosen a raw material programmeof  90m, and a food programme of  75m.    Thevlatter happens tobe about the minimum level that would leave our bread suppliesunaffected:    the former allows industrial output to continue atperhaps some 10% below the rate in the last half   a? 1&quot;9U7 but has drastic effects upon building.&apos;     But otherpatterns are possible.    For example, we could maintain building or maintain industrial output by cutting bread;    or we couldrestore bacon and sugar,  (which take the worst cuts), by further reductions in industrial output.20.      The  90m. dollar area raw material programme implies cuts of  75m.    We may also suppose that of the  hOm.  cut on Argentineprogrammes,  era. is taken on: the small raw material component,almost all hides.    Excluding the cuts from other countries that have already been mentioned in paragraphs 11  and 12 above, theaggregate reduction amounts only to some 12% of the total rawmaterial programme.    But this is a misleading proportion.    Theprogramme we have considered allows generally for risingconsumption, and increased stocks.    Some cut can therefore betaken without reduction of output below recent levels.    On the
other- hand,  the cuts cannot he evenly spread, since some commodities - of which wool.is the most important example -come wholly from areas where no cut would he required, while others only come to a very small extent from the western hemisphere.    In yet other cases without the dollar suppliesother non-dollar imports cannot he efficiently used -&quot;carbonblock required for motor tyre production is a case in &quot;point.21.      The maximum cuts would amount to some 1 5-20?a on supplies to home industry by comparison with consumption during thelatter half &quot;of 19h7.    This would apply.to non-ferrous and light metals, softwood, -paper and pulp and to. a large range of miscellaneous materials.    At the other extreme with somematerials, such as steel and hardwoods,  the complete excisionof the dollar supplies would still leave sufficient .to allowUnited Kingdom consumption   to be at or above present levels.The effects of the cuts would therefore bo widespread, butthey --would not be universal.    They would cause an acutedistortion, rss well as s .mo general contraction.22.      The cuts in food and feedingstuffs programmes, must reach 55m. from dollar sources and rather over  h5m, from theArgentine, with further cuts on sterling area programmes-.which,as has been suggested in paragraphs 10-11 might be of the order&apos;of  50m.    The programmes on which these cuts fall stand at 790m, for food and  110m. for feedingstuffs for 19k&amp;/9 fromthe world as a whole, but in these ... totals the  22.5m.  allowed .from the Western Hemisphere includes three quarters of thewheat,  two-fifths of the carcase meat and the sugar,  and over half the feedingstuffs.25.     We should not have a free choice between the alternativeways of making these cuts and we would be faced with extremelydifficult bilateral negotiations.    We cannot guess whatagreements could be made, but we suppose that we keep theCanadian wheat,  and flour but abandon ..all other dollar food supplies,  of which the Canadian bacon,  the Caribbean sugar and canadian eggs and cheese are the greater part.    (This is almost certainly too optimistic).    The Argentine cuts we concentratepartly on linseed oil (which might&quot; gradually be made up from home agriculture) on some animal fats we are now taking unwillingly,but most of all on coarse grains of which 1-g-ra. tons costing over-ShOm. are in the programme.    If we could dispense with three-quarters of these (as an immediate measure),  carcase-meat andoilcake a-uld be left unaffected.D.    CONSEQUENCES TO THE HOME ECONOMY2k.      These readjustments to.the balance of payments wouldadminister a number of violent shocks to the home economy at anumber of separate points.    The results to the structure of output, exports, Investment, consumption and employment are extremely difficult to assess.    We should be faced with anabrupt transition from a partially suppressed inflation to something not unlike a slump.    It is conceivable that afterthe Initial period of dislocation we would in fact move into adepression of the classical kind, with heavy reductions in investment due to general pessimism and uncertainty in thebusiness world leading on to a spiral of declining income and demand.    But we have assumed that this is avoided,  if only because some types of investment could be expanded innationalised industry and other public sectors, and becausetaxation could if necessary be relaxed promptly.
25.      ^dniinlstratiwe problems the rapidity of adjustment that would - be required wouldbe much greater than anything achieved in the past,  and would almost certainly os beyond the administrative means available.No controls similar to those we have today could ensure theexpansion of bard, sarrensj exports supposed;    nor distributein an ideal and fair way the reduced supplies of e.g* non-ferrous metals, the end-uses of which we do not now attemptto control.    It is virtually certain that we should have toadept rough and ready methods.    We would have to loosen manyprice controls which could scarcely work with raw materialsupplies reduced and widespread substitution being called for.Wo   might have       emsldor devalueti tq in an attempt t j aidexperts to dollar markets, and to discourage the idemand for dollar materials.    We should have to prohibitrather than restrain the use- of e. g, non-ferrous metals ininessential uses if we were to protect export output.    Weshould have to be prepared for obvious maldistributions of resources, critical Bottlenecks, and paradoxical surplusesto a much greater extent than today.    This applies especially to manufactures, but there w wild  :f course ais-o be ,sesiere &apos;&quot;Nstrain jn agricaxilaar&amp;X policy and consumer rationing andan  expansion  sf all kinds vf black market.The fiscal problems would be most difficult.    Someexpenditures would rise (e.g. unemployment benefit by;3150-200ra,);    some revenues would fall (e,g.  tobacco dutiesby something like MiOQss.).    In the early stages  the spendingof accumulated savings, might offset the fall in income due to unemployment.    The cuts in building would reduce the call for savings.    If there ware -a period of dislocation during whichoutput was low bat expenditure remained high, it might even be that acutely inflationary conditions developed, despiter i s i ng unem.pl oyraent,26.      Implications to the level of food consumptionThe cuts assumed in Canadian and other dollar imports,and in Empire butter, tea, and coffee imply heavy reductions in rations;    sugar,      to 5   -unces;    butter,  3 to&apos; 1.0;&apos;bac n, to 1  ounce the year thraurh;    cheese to even less;with other cuts in eggs and m-wat. Miscellaneous non-dollar imports would also probably come down.    The reduction in calorieintake below the progressed level of 2,890 would probably beabout 220;    i.e. the level would probably be a little below thelevel during the present period of potato shortage,  and over1,05ft below the pre--war average.    But even if in the long runagricultural adjustments restored total calories,  the dietwould be even more distorted from the traditional paiaacm,,thanthe present.27.      Implications to Agricultural PolicyIn paragraph 22 we supposed that as an immediate measureArgentine meat imports were not reduced, and that the wholereduction fell on coarse grains.    This implied a reduction inthe latter that Blight (if certain compensating supplies could,be obtained elsewhere) permit feeding stuff rations to continue as at present, but which would wholly wipe out any developmentof the livestock expansion, programme.    Whether it would in fact be better to reduce overseas meat supplies and take more coarse grains, or lower the extraction rate and provide feedingstuffsat the expense of direct bread supplies and a further cut incalorie intake would of course be important issues of policy.It is at-least clear that the agricultural policy as a whole would need re-examination.    Much would depend upon estimates oflonger term changes in, e.g.,  the terms of trade and relativeprices of cereals and. livestock,       . . -.-8-
28.      Implications to other ConsumptionThe main directly adverse effects upon the level of consumption of items other than food have mostly already been mentioned.    Pressure on cotton supplies and the need to export a.major dollar saver and dollar earner would virtuallyremove consumer cotton goods from the home market.   The reduction inleather imports would have a large effect upon the supplies orthe quality of footwear.    Par less motor traffic than is nowpermitted would be possible,    newspapers and books would bereduced.    The whole range of consumption using non-ferrous metals from trivialities to electrical gear of all kinds wouldbe curtailed.    The cinema industry would   be -worse disorganised--. than it has been recently,     A reduction by threes - &quot;  I.quarters in tobacco consumption would greatly affect morale,and, having regard also to the fiscal effects, it may be-thought that we have been unrealistic in not assuming that we-would in the event prefer to cut food or raw materials rather&apos;than cigarettes.    On the other hand service industries would be free to&quot;expand, and the shortage of domestic workers both in   i -&quot;institutions and -private homes might be relieved.    (Indeed sucawork might even be a fit object for encouragement as pro via mgwork requiring little material).    These changes would betweenVaem amount to a very share change in the standard of living.It should not be unbearable but it would certainly call, for mncU-patience and a willingness to change old establishes naoito.go.      general implications to. industrial OutputThw effects pf some ff the cuts in imports, such as thosein timber and-hides would or could be confined to particular industries.      Other cuts,  such as those in *il, non-ferrous metals,   and in the whole range of chemicals vand miscellaneousmaterials would directly or at few removes, affect allmanufactures and would tend, where  they did not reduce output outright,at least to raise scsts and lower productivity.      There would need to be,  if output were to be maintained, an early adoption of substitutes? and there would be little time for their discovery.But given a strong enough money motive a good deal might be done(no doubt at the cost of lowering standards) by for example,using steel, which would be relatively plentiful, in place of,aluminium or timber,  concrete in place of timber, alternative[materials for paper making,  rubber in place of leather, wool iniPlace rf cotton and so on.j30,      Consequences to Investment;The most obvious effects would flow from the reduction c-fsrftwbod imports.       Given  rbher r-ocuirements this might mean ----- cut of some 250,000 standards in the building industry,  and though-.Inot all this need fall an new housing a reduction of new houseIjktilding to something of the order rf 50,000 might be inevitable,Respite the use of substitutes.      The electricity generatingIprOgramme would almost certainly ha^e to be curtailed, mainlylbs cause  of the reduction in non-ferrous metals.     , Furtherjdirect effects would be the reduction in capital goods im.po.rhsand the- widespread consequences to output of the dislocationslalready discussed,1)1,      These are effects on supply, but as has been said,Remand, now stimulated by labour shortage, would also change.&quot;Upbuilding,   and mechanical engineering ai*e sectors in which
slump conditions might easily occur.      But some of the adjustments, in particular,  reconversion to coal usage,wwuld entail fresh expense;    public investment,  rail transportroads,  land reclamation and some parts of iron and steel couldbe expanded and there would be a very strong case fora prompt expansion of dollar saving investment, if necessary by Government action, especially in the chemical and oil refinery fields.     A wholesale collapse of investment couldbe avoided.      Moreover export demand might continue ata generally high level:    we have already presupposed special efforts to supply capital goods to some countries in placeof gold or dollars.32.      Consequences to ExportsWe have.already assumed that exports to hard currencyareas,  and dollar saving exports to the sterling area have tobe pushed extremely hard,  at a time when costs generallyw-:uld probably be rifling.      But the materialcuts could not be confined to home market production and weshould almost certainly find it impossible to maintain total exports for production reasons;    and,  as mentioned below/,overseas demand also might contract,     We have taken no account of these possibilities in the review  -of the short termcrisis,  however, because it might be possible for a time to concentrate the reduction of exports on the less essentialexports tm areas with which we  should otherwise be currently -in surplus, i.e.  on &quot;unrequited&quot; exports.33*      Consequences to EmploymentThere would be large primary effects on employmentin metal using industries, building,  clothing,  road transport,and paper consuming trades.      Borne of these might be offset by reduction in specifications, the use of substitutes, and so*n.      There might also be a secondary reduction in the distributive trades.     On the other hand the service trades,and domestic service could increase,  and mining, farming,  andwool textiles could expand.     Women might leave industry in large numbers,  and the present oressure for the older workers to stay would be reversed. On balance we estimate thattjneuiployme:-might,  apart from the workspreading effects of short-time and reduced hours,  rise to something like 1,300,000.E *   LONGER TERM PROSPECTS3k.      The broad sketch given in the preceding sections triest*- depict the most favourable state of the economy that we might manage to reach in. say, a year after it had becomecertain that we would get no E R.P. Aid.      Things might wellbe worse if the downward readjustment could not be achieved in an orderly manner.      They could probably not be much better.But this sketch presents only one phase.     Pour major longer-term factors sh*uld be mentioned.35, First, the dreariness of the consumption standards towhich we should fall,   the inrale-ouacy of the national diet., andthe increase in Ufeomplavnieut might give rise t.; nav&amp;st one!Inefficiency.      These w:.&apos;Uld probably lower output and expocr-tr. .still furtha.r.,..ond&quot;&apos;might start a  &apos; &amp;-3wnwaav3- epira 1&apos;  to whichthere would be no obvious end.
36. Secondly, there might be a change in the terms of tradein our favour.      This might come about in two separate ways.(a) Since tow United Kingdom is by far the largest importer -from Canada and the Argentine the reductions in our purchasesmight start movements ia the prices of their products.      Initself, a fail in import prices would be beneficial since itwould reduce the quantitative cuts in imports and raise thereal value of our remaining reserves.      But the same fall inprimary product prices would,  if due to this cause, veryprobably reduce the demand for our manufactures.      on balance,, we might gain somewhat if these effects were confined to these countries;    but if there were a general reduction of world trade the gain would be much moreproblematical.(b) There might,  independently,  of  anything our crisiscompels us to do,  be a lowering of import prices as a resultof increased efficiency and output among primary producersfollowing upon the high prices they now enjoy and the fadingof the effects of war.      This would not affect the demandfor our exports,  and would therefore be wholly favourable.But changes of this kind could only be gradual:    they couldnot be relied upon to extricate us quickly.37*    Thirdly, we might in two or three years expand our exports, especially of capital goods.      Little allowance for this had been made in the account given of short periodadjustments, since the time lags are very substantial.But there are physical limits to these additional exports(which in any case are very vulnerable in a world slumpsituation) and they would be alternative to home investment,and this might not be much above the maintenance level.But we could try to plan more deliberately than we do todaythat wo sell capital goods that would directly or indirectlyincrease tne output of goods we would wish to import.      Ifwe secured the close co-operation of Europe and the empire in a  joint effort of this kind we might gradually end the worst of the limitations on output.3&apos;3*    Lastly, we might hope for a rise in the level of theUnited States imports and of American foreign investment.Either of these developments might replenish the supply of dollars to the rest of the world and permit a resumptionof multilateral trade.      This would relieve us by removing the prime cause of the whole crisis.      Developments of thiskind although perfectly possible are not in any way certain,and they are wholly outside our control.39.    We give this brief review of the longer-term prospectto show that there is no reason to suppose that the short-term crisis we have described would necessarily be transient.All the longer-term developments are extremely uncertain butit seems on the whole likely that the economy,  having moved to a generally lower level, would tend to  stay there for aconsiderable time.Larch-   -: 9lt 8 %
