1Text of Note to be sent by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the United States Ambassador in London at the timeof Signature of the Agreement.The first two sentences should read as follows -&quot;I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that itis impossible for the United Kingdom Government on signing theEconomic Co-operation Agreement with the Government of the UnitedStates, to give a complete&apos; list of those Colonial territories which will participate in the Agreement.      The reason is that in several cases it is necessary for   Colonial Governments to be given a reasonable opportunity to consider the implications of theAgreement for them&quot;.
It is also understood that arrangements negotiated under Article V might appropriately include provision for consultation, in accordance with theprinciples of Article 32 of the Havana Charter(:l) for an international trade organisation, in the event that stockpiles are liquidated.6. It is understood that it should not be assumed from paragraph 2 ofArticle VI that the existing facilities entended by the United Kingdom to relief goods and packages are inadequate.7.   It is understood that the Government of the United Kingdom will not*; requested, under paragraph 2 (a) of Article VII, to furnish detailedformation about minor projects or confidential commercial or technical information the disclosure of which would. injure legitimate commercial interests.8. It is understood that the Government of the United States in makingthe notifications referred to in paragraph 2 of Article IX would bear in mind the desirability of restricting, so far as practicable, the number of officialsfor whom full diplomatic privileges would be requested.

July, 1948.&apos;I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that, as I have explained the reasons why it is impossible for the United Kingdom Govern-ment, on signing the Economic Co-operation Agreement with the Governmentof the United States, to give a complete list of those Colonial territories which will participate in the Agreement; namely, that in several cases it is: necessary for Colonial Governments to be given a reasonable opportunity: of considering the implications of the agreement for them.I have also explained to your Excellency that a decision in the case ofSouthern Rhodesia will rest entirely with the Government of that country,and that the Government of the United Kingdom is unable at this time fbsay what the decision will be.It is my understanding that most Colonial Governments may be expected: to participate in the Agreement within a very short time. But the Governmentof the United Kingdom recognises that if within a reasonable period after the signature of the Agreement some of the more important territories concerned(other than Southern Rhodesia) are not participating in it the Governmentof the United States would be entitled to regard this as a change in the relationship of the parties under the Agreement, affecting the form orI continuance of assistance to the United Kingdom.   It is my understandingI that before any action were to be taken by the Government of the UnitedStates there would be consultation between the two Governments.I have, &amp;c.(3) Cmd. 7375.

States of America or the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain&quot;and Northern Ireland, respectively.,-3, The undertakings in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, are entered into inthe light of the absence at the present time of effective or significant tariff barriers to imports into the areas herein concerned. In the event that suchtariff barriers are imposed, it is understood that such undertakings shall be without prejudice to the application of the principles set forth in the HavanaCharter for an International Trade Organisation^) relating to the reduction of tariffs on a mutually advantageous basis.4. It is recognised that the absence of a uniform rate of exchange forthe currency of the areas in Western Germany referred to in paragraph 1 abovemay have the effect of indirectly subsidising the exports of such areas to an extent which it would be difficult to calculate exactly. So long as such acondition exists, and if consultation with the Government of the United Statesfails to reach an agreed solution to the problem, it is understood that it wouldnot be inconsistent with the undertaking in paragraph 1 for the Governmentof the United Kingdom ,to levy a countervailing duty on imports of such goods equivalent to the estimated amount of such subsidisation, where the(&apos;) Cmd. 7258.O Cmd. 7375.
