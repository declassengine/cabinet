120THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVEENMBNT)SEC RET COPY NO.   ^ ICP. (U8)  1721st July,  191+8.INTEBlikTIOU^L WHEAT agreement memorandum &quot;fay the Minister of food at their meeting or. 17th June (CM. (U8) l+OthConclusions, Minute 3) the ca&quot;blnet considered my memorandum(CP. (h8) 150) on the International Wheat Agreement anddecider! that the Agreement should &quot;be ratified.      The UnitedKingdom instrument of acceptance has now been prepared and despatched to Washington for- depositing with the United StatesState Department forthwith.      The United Kingdom high commissioners in Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Pretoria andDelhi and the United Kingdom Representative in Dublin havebeen requested to inform the respect Governments that this action has been taken.-BINET2. Since the Cabinets previous decision the UnitedStates Congress has gon^ into recess and is not expected tore-assemble until after the November elections - i.e.  probably not before January.      The Senate has not ratified theInternational Wheat Agreement,  and the United States government cannot implement the Agreement without the.Senate&apos;s ratification.3* Article XX of the Agreement provides that the new international Wheat Council - consisting of those countrieswhich have ratified the Agreement by 1st July - shall hold its-first Meeting in Washington &quot;early in July&quot;.      It was agreed by the representatives of the nine signatory countries who oreMembers of the Preparatory Committee that the first Meeting ofthe Council shall be held on 6th July, and that the preparatory committee itself should meet to prepare the agenda and makeother necessary preparations on 29th June.      The United kingdom delegation sailed for Washington on 2iith June.h. The failure of the United States Government to securethe ratification of the Agreement by Congress by 1st Julycreates a new situation, which was not envisaged in CP. (1+8)  130.As far as is known in London all the signatory countries,except the United States, will either have ratified theAgreement by 1st July or Intend to apply for an extension ofthe period allowed for ratification in accordance with theprovisions of Article XX.      This article,  however, makes no provision for extending the period allowed to an exporting country for ratification:    the concession applies only toimporting countries.      Canada and Australia - the only twoexporting countries, apart from the United States - havealready decided to deposit their- instruments of acceptance by 1st July.-1-
1215. It is generally accepted that the operational partof the Agreement cannot &quot;be &quot;brought into effect unless theUnited States is a  party to it,  since the guaranteed exportsof the United States under the Agreement amount to 37% of thetotal guaranteed exports.     Article XX, however,  provides thatany signatory country may withdraw from the Agreement at thefirst Meeting of the Council if it considers that the guaranteed sales or purchases of the countries which have-formally accepted the Agreement are insufficient to ensureits successful operation.6. It is not known  (though we have asked for information from Washington) what line the United States Government intends to take in the new situation.      If they were to devise some means,  e.g. by a special Session of Congress, of ratifying the Agreement within say the next two months they might be ableto participate effectively in the working of the Agreement atan early enough date to enable it to he brought into operationsuccessfully for the crop year 191+8/149.      The Canadian Ministerof Trade and Commerce,  speaking in the House of Commons in ottawa,  stated recently that there were &quot;fair indications&quot; thatthe United States would ratify the Agreement later this year.On the other hand,  it seems more likely that the United State.::.:now cannot ratify in time toc participate effectively in 19^8/.u10*and the Australian Minister for Commerce and Agriculture isreported to have announced that in this event Australia will -at the opening Meeting of the Council withdraw from theAgreement under the provisions of Article XX.7. Soon after they arrive in Washington the UnitedKingdom delegation will probably be able to clarify the presentsituation and report further on (a) the intentions&apos; of theUnited States Government and (b) the views of the other signatory Governments as to the best course to be taken.Subject to any reports received from them,  I suggest that theinstructions of the United Kingdom delegation for the firstMeeting of the Council on 6th July should be:-(a) If they are satisfied that the United StatesGovernment intends to,  and will,  in fact, be ableto,  ratify the Agreement in time for it to be putinto effective operation for the crop year 19^8/h9they should announce that the United Kingdomratification stands,  and should endeavour to persuadeother delegations to do the same,  so that the operational part of the Agreement may,  as  provided in Article XX, come into effect Las from 1st Augustbetv/een those countries which have ratified it,and. so that the door may be left open for the Unit-ClStates to come in as soon as she has ratified.(b) This course should,  however,  only be adopted providedthat it is agreed by all the signatories to extend the period allowed for Governments to withdraw fromthe Agreement.      At present no Government canwithdraw after the opening Meeting of the Councilunless it considers that its national security isendangered by the outbreak of hostilities.      Shouldan extension of&quot;&apos;the time for ratification be grantedto enable the United States to participate in theAgreement in the crop year 19U8/1+9 it would, be essential that signatory Governments should retain the option to withdraw if the United States has notratified by the later date allowed by this extension.
122(c) - If, on the other hand,  it appears to our delegationthat there is no prospect of the United StatesGovernment ratifying in time to participateeffectively in the operation of the agreement for 19I+S/J+9s  and if this view is shared &quot;by theother delegations at the first Council Meeting,the United Kingdom delegation should announce itswithdrawal.      In this event they should, at thesame time, state that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be willing to consider any proposals thatmay be male for entering into a new agreement for a later period, but they should make it clearthat there could be no question of the present agreement, with the existing price ranges, being adopted as it stands for 191+9/50 and the subsequentcrop years.J.

Even if however the new Houseof Representatives favours ratification and actsaccordingly the complications constitutional and operationalarising from upwards of 6 months delay would be such that canada and Australia, particularly latter, would find itimpossible adhere to agreement for crop year 191+8/2+9.We ourselves would be in same position and I have informallyindicated that little more than 6 weeks delay is aboutlimit for us if agreement is to operate over 192+8/1+9 cropyear.     It was agreed at our informal meeting that postpone-ment of operative date &quot;by only a few weeks is all that ispractical. .2. At meeting of Preparatory Committee and of the Councilon July 6 the USA representative will &quot;be given opportunityto state positively whether there is any reasonable likelihood of his Government ratifying agreement by end August ^9h&amp;,It seems certain there is not, but administration will nodoubt be anxious avoid making any categorical statement to that effect.Prom Anderson.1.Having considered again all factors in situation of February at earliest is most improbable.This view is
AMAZE 9235   (Continued)   - II3. There are therefore two contingencies for which wehave to provide,(A) A plain statement that ratification &quot;by USA by31 August is not a possibility.(B) Qualified statement to effect that administrationcannot anticipate what action may be taken by President asto recall of Congress but that possibility of ratification by 31 August cannot be ruled out.h.. In event of (a) I would suggest that UK delegation should give formal notice of withdrawal interms somewhatas follows &quot;being of the opinion that the guaranteed sales of the exporting countries whose Governments have ratified the agreement are insufficient ensured its successful operation, the UK gi^e notice to the Government of the UnitedStates of America in accordance with the provisions ofArticle XX. para 3 of the Inter national Wheat Agreement of6 March, 1914-8 of Its withdrawal from the International wheat agreement.      This notice of withdrawal shall be fully effective in respect of ail right and obligations of theUnited Kingdom as fx-02a 1 August, 191+8&quot;*5* If at the meeting of the Council the  position is as (B)above it seems desirable that we should indicate our willingness to do everything possible to facilitate the belated accession of the USA and to Eake the agreement operate this crop year* provided the operative date is postponed for only a limited perioflIn doing this however it should be possible to pin theresponsibility for the failure of the agreement on the USAfairly effectively, notwithstanding failure of Prance and a/pretty
