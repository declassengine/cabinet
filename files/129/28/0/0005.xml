June 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    3 0C.F. (48) 15521st June, 1948CABINETNUTRITION ENQUIRY  IN  THE  ANGLO-UNITED  STATES  zone of germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs attach for the information of my colleagues a report by Sir Jack Drummondand Professor Cowell on the nutritional position in Germany.2.   The circumstances of this report are as follows : Some weeks ago the United States Secretary of the Army appointed aCommission to undertake a nutrition enquiry in the Bizonal area and inviteda British nutritional expert to be associated with the work of the Commission.Sir Jack Drummond and Professor Cowell were selected for this task. Theofficial report of the Commission is at present under consideration by the UnitedStates Government, but at my suggestion the United Kingdom representativesprepared an independent confidential report which is, I am told, in some respectsrather fuller than the official report but follows its general lines. It is thisindependent confidential report which I now circulate.3. The nutritional state of the people in the Bizonal area is well summarised in the fourth part of the report. This says that it has now become stabilisedat a level which permits the maintenance of a fair state of health, but in thecase of the industrial workers, particularly in the big cities, is not alwayscapable of supporting full working capacity. The general conclusion to be drawn from the report therefore is that from a health point of view the Bizonal area has turned the corner of its food problem, but that the level of feeding must beraised further if German production is to be maximised and the Bizonal area playits part in the European Recovery Programme.4. The report gives an interesting indication of the additional number ofcalories which will be required in order to meet these needs. It recognises firstlythat the current practice by which the calorie level is estimated in terms of the basic normal consumer ration is no longer realistic owing to supplements andthe obtaining of supplies off the ration. On the other hand inevitable wastagemust be held to account for a loss of at least 10 per cent, between the calorielevel at the retail stage of distribution (on which the basic normal consumer rationis calculated) and the amount actually eaten by the normal consumer. The resultof these calculations is this. Taking into account supplementary rations andoff-the-ration foods, the present basic normal consumer ration of about 1,500calories daily probably implies an average -per capita ration of 2,220 caloriesdaily at the retail distribution stage. Making allowance for wastage, this wouldgive an actual consumption of about 2,000 calories. The corresponding figuresrelating to a 1,800 calorie level which it is hoped to provide within two monthsare 2,500 and 2,250 calories respectively.5. This last figure cannot, however, be regarded as satisfactory from thepoint of view of maximising production. The report estimates that it is only when a figure of 2,540 calories (corresponding to the present 2,000 and the expected2,250 quoted above) is reached that provision will have been made for rehabilitation-tation, restitution of weight and full working capacity.35505B
6. The report also contains some interesting comments which are summarised below: (i) The rationing system should be simplified and the wide variety of specialcategories entitled to exceptional rations gradually abolished. Thispolicy is one which I myself have been advocating for some little time.(ii) A greater variety of food is required and in particular more meat andfat is essential if the best results are to be obtained.(iii) One staple and cheap commodity such as bread or potatoes should bederationed as soon as possible.(iv) The Black Market necessitates additional supplies from overseas tobolster up the official ration, which has in turn been sapped by the drainage of the Black Market. Nothing can be done to eradicate afirmly established Black Market except the supply of more foodthrough legal channels,(v) Some 16 per cent, of industrial production, not returned in officialrecords, is diverted through various channels to secure increased, food for the workers.(vi) German doctors and scientists tend to be out-of-date in their knowledge and lacking in objectivity. Many of their statements about Germanfeeding are strongly influenced by political considerations and mustnot be taken at their face value.7. We hope that the report of the Commission will influence the UnitedStates Congress to vote sufficient funds to render possible the introduction of a normal consumer ration of 2,000 calories per day in the near future. In themeantime, I am in touch with British officials in Germany on the subject of thisreport and the measures which can be taken to give effect to such of its recommen-dations as are practicable under existing conditions. Official action by the. Bizonalauthorities can, however, only be taken on the basis of the official report preparedunder the auspices of the United States Secretary of the Army; and the appearance of this report is now awaited.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,21st June, 1948.annex report OF THE BRITISH PARTICIPANTS IN THE NUTRITIONENQUIRY IN THE ANGLO-UNITED STATES ZONE OF GERMANYUNDERTAKEN BY A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THEUNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE ARMY IN MAY 1948The terms of reference were to survey the state of nutrition of the Germanpeople and to determine the amount of food which would have to be made availableto them in order that they might play their full part in the task of achievingEuropean recovery.The visit to Germany was between 12th and 28th May, during which time members of the Commission visited a number of towns in the American andBritish Zones. Many samples of the German population in factories, schools and universities were examined, and many British, American and German PublicHealth Officers, nutrition experts, scientists and physicians were interviewed.&quot;We found ourselves in close agreement with our American colleagues, and the findings which we are about to report are substantially the same as those embodied in the Official American Report in the drafting of which we participated.1. Nutrition and HealthFrom our own previous experience in Germany, our personal observationsduring this present enquiry and the mass of data placed at our disposal in bothZones, we conclude that the nutritional state of the Germans improved during thepast year, after a period during which their physical condition had deteriorated.Their nutritional shape has, in fact, now become stabilised at a level which
permits the maintenance of a fair state of health, but in the case of the industrialworker, particularly in the big cities, is not always capable of supporting fullworking capacity.The farmers and rural dwellers are, for the most part, as well nourished as before the war.The present level of nutrition among the industrial workers in the citiesrepresents a state of chronic depletion, with subsistence on an amount of foodwhich does not permit full output of work. This state of depletion is characterisedprimarily by a loss of weight, which affects many adult town dwellers and amongwhom it is commonly of the order of fourteen to twenty pounds below acceptable&quot; normal&quot; standards.Many of the German figures quoted to us for the incidence of various degrees of underweight were clearly unreliable, since they were based on the Broca scale which is notoriously untrustworthy. The Broca standard is used to decide whetheror not a German is entitled to receive supplementary rations for underweight.Actual measurements of British army personnel have shown that a largeproportion of men would qualify for the underweight supplement according to theBroca scale.Such losses of weight are not uncommonly accompanied by loss of strengthand vigour and by the following additional effects, all of which become more marked as more weight is lost: (a) Muscular wasting, accounting in part for loss of strength;(b) Lowered rate of body metabolism;(c) Mild anaemia;(d) Lowered basal pulse rate, blood pressure and body temperature;(e) Variable degrees of inattention, irritability or apathy.On the other hand, there were many features in the situation which werereassuring from the health point of view : (a) There was an absence of any significant amount of specific vitamin ormineral deficiency disease apart from rickets, the rather high incidence of which is attributable to the very imperfect distribution by theGermans of available supplies of vitamin D.(6) The average body weights of children of pre-school and school ages arenot appreciably below the pre-war levels and are almost the sameas those of American children of the same age and height. Theseaverages include the weights of many children from rural areas.In urban areas the children show a variable amount of under-weight which is most marked in those between the ages of nine andfourteen. The impression we gained from the clinical examination of urban children supports the truth of these body weight observations.(c) The General Mortality Rate in Bizonal Germany still compares favourable(except in Berlin) with that obtaining in England and Wales. Evenin Berlin, where it has been exceptionally high, it is now falling.(d) The Infant Mortality Rate, though higher than it was in the pre-war years, was considerably lower in 1947 than in 1946. In Berlin it hasbeen exceptionally high since the war, but has fallen a great dealsince 1945.(e) The Birth Rate compares satisfactorily with that in other european countries, though it is not as high as it was in the pre-war yearswhen it was being boosted up by unorthodox methods.(/) There have been no serious epidemics nor any significant increase ininfectious diseases, except tuberculosis.(g) Much has been said and written about the increase in tuberculosis inGermany since the war. We felt that it would be presumptuous of us to attempt any personal investigation of the true position, since we were familiar with the two official reports on Tuberculosis inGermany recently published respectively by the Foreign Office (1948)and the Office of Military Government for Germany (United States)(1948).* Both of these reports state that this disease is decliningafter a rise during the war and in most parts of Bizonal Germany isapproaching the pre-war level, though it is still excessive in Berlin.* &quot;Tuberculosis, United States Zone, Germany.&quot; Special Eeport of the Military Governor,May 1948. &quot;Tuberculosis in the British Zone of Germany, 1947.&quot; (London: H.M. stationery office, 1948.)35505 b 2
The Tuberculosis Mortality Rate is about the same in Germany as it isat present in Great Britain, and is lower than the pre-war rates in France andother parts of Europe.It is pointed out that the &quot; alarming increase &quot; in new cases of pulmonarytuberculosis which has been so much publicised is largely due to the inclusionsince September 1946 of a special category of &quot; Tuberculous &quot; patient, which theBritish observers state should not be taken into account when assessing the trend of the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Although trjere is no causewhatsoever for alarm in the present state of health of the German people, wemust emphasise that the existing subnormal state of nutrition of a large sectionof the German adult population has been reached and is maintained only atthe expense of (a) Loss of weight;(6) Diminished capacity for sustained muscular effort;(c) Lowered body metabolism;(h) Decreased work output.It is axiomatic that work can be done only by the expenditure of energy.Energy must be derived from food or body tissue. If weight is to be maintainedwith inadequate food, work output must be decreased. If work output is main-tained with inadequate food, weight will be lost until finally weakness preventsfurther muscular effort. Among many Germans at present a compromise has beenreached in which a loss of weight and lowered body metabolism have made it possible to maintain some degree of muscular activity on a reduced food intake,the work output being, however, considerably below full capacity or the pre-war level.The combination of loss of weight and decreased work permits the outwardappearance of a fairly satisfactory nutritional state. However, any attempt toincrease work output without a corresponding increase in food must result in further loss of weight, decreased ability to work and poorer health. A large amount of data indicating the correspondence between work output and foodintake was examined by us and we are satisfied with the validity of the conclusions.Among factors other than inadequate food intake which contribute to the decrease in work output among Germans to-day are the following: (a) Time and energy spent in searching for food;(b) Shortage of housing, footwear and clothing;(c) Shortage of raw materials;(d) Lack of things to buy in the shops;(e) Unsatisfactory state of the currency;(/) Lowered morale.Some indication of the importance of such factors is given by an estimategiven to us that some 16 per cent, of industrial production, not returned in officialrecords, is diverted through various channels to secure increased food for theworkers.2. Food supply from theoretical consideration of the fujl energy needs of the Germanpopulation of &quot; non-self-suppliers &quot; in the two zones, there is derived the estimateof 2,540 calories per head per day. This is a weighted per capita figure, coveringall classes of the population from infants to the heaviest workers.It is important to appreciate that it refers to the calorie equivalence of thefood actually eaten and not to that of food at the retail stage of distribution.Estimates of the latter can be made after making a reasonable, if arbitrary,allowance for inevitable wastage in shops and homes. A measure of the magnitude of this allowance is indicated by the data for the United Kingdom. Thetheoretical per capita need of the civilian population for energy is 2,550 caloriesdaily slightly more than the German figure of 2,540. From 1941 to 1947 the foodavailable at the retail stage of distribution provided about 2,890 calories daily.*&apos;The difference of 340 calories represents a wastage of somewhat less than 12 percent.  This is low compared with pre-war conditions.If an even greater economy is assumed to obtain in Germany, as is probable,an arbitrary allowance of 10 per cent, for wastage can be added to the basic* &quot;Food Consumption Levels in United Kingdom,&quot; H.M. Stationery Office, London, 1947
theoretical requirement, giving the figure of 2,790 calories per day per head forthe energy value of the total food supply assessed at the retail stage of distribution.With &quot;a reservation about the need for greater variety of food, to which reference is made later on in this report, it is considered that supplies at this level should provide what is needed for rehabilitation, restoration of weight and full working capacity.It is also our considered opinion that at any level lower than that represented by 2,790 calories at the retail stage (2,540 as food actually eaten) this objective willnot be reached.It is relevant to point out that the situation in the United Kingdom duringthe first half of 1948 has not been as satisfactory as it was during the years1941-47. Restriction of food supplies reduced the per capita calorie equivalenceof the food supply to 2,670.* The margin for wastage allowance between this figure and the requirement of 2,550 calories is narrower than could be achieved by the strictest economy. One is obliged, therefore, to accept the view that foodrepresenting 2,670 calories per head per day would not provide the full energyneeds of the United Kingdom civilians.There are two disturbing features of the food supply problem as seen in urban areas of Germany to-day. In the first place, the multiplication of categories of those entitled to supplementary rations, without there being adequate meansof checking certification, has inevitably led to widespread abuse. The &quot; normalconsumer,&quot; whose slender ration has been the subject of so many misguided andmisleading comments in published statements, is likely before long to become anextinct species. He already represents less than a quarter of the population, andhis numbers are steadily declining.The wide variety of special categories represents an administrative impro-visation that was necessitated by the difficult supply condition of the past twoyears, but having regard on the one hand to widespread abuse and, on the other,to the forecast of an improved supply of food, it is opportune, in our opinion, to plan towards abolishing a number of these special classes and re-establishing a stable and properly constituted &quot; normal consumer &quot; category.An important objective should be a drastic simplification of the rationing system based on one basic category, together with appropriate provision for thespecial needs of mothers, children, and the sick, and with no more than two categories of &quot; workers.&quot; If it were practicable, after establishing a reasonableration for the normal consumer, to provide extra food for workers exclusivelythrough industrial canteens, as is done in the United Kingdom with great success,so much the better.The second matter that is very disturbing concerns the food that Germansacquire &quot; off the ration &quot; by fair means or foul. The magnitude of these supplies is assessed in terms of calories as of the order of 300 per day per head for the urban population. This figure covers a very wide range. We were shown datacollected by Dr. Lehmann at Dortmund indicating that individual families mayget as much as 2,000 calories above the ration per day per head, whereas othersget virtually nothing.The Germans readily admit that the illegal measures which they are obligedto adopt to obtain more food are profoundly demoralising the people, even thechildren. This is as serious a matter as is the diversion of food from normaldistributing channels that occurs.Experience after the Liberation of France, Belgium and Holland provedconclusively that nothing can be done to check a firmly established &apos;&apos; black market &apos;&apos;including a barter system, except the supply of more food through legal channels.To dispel the evil influence of the widespread illicit trading in food prevailing in Germany to-day is a part of the process of rehabilitation to which the greatest importance must be attached.The food situation in the two zones to-day is represented by a basic normalconsumer ration equivalent to about 1,500 calories daily. The many supplements,taken together, account for an additional &quot;spread&quot; of about 420 calories.Supplies obtained off the ration by one means or another are estimated as providinganother 300 calories, making a -per capita total of 2,220 per day.We were informed that a proposal to raise the basic ration to 1,800 caloriesis under consideration and that, if this were done, the corresponding figures forthe &quot;spread&quot; and for &quot;off the ration&quot; food would be 400 and 300 caloriesrespectively, giving a total of about 2,500 calories a day.At neither level (2,220 and 2,500 calories as food at the retail stage of distri-bution) can rehabilitation and full industrial production be attained.  Allowing* &quot;Economic Survey for 1948.&quot;   H.M. Stationery Office, 1948.   Cmd. 7344.
an arbitrary 10 per cent, for inevitable waste, the figures representing actualconsumption are respectively about 2,000 and 2,250 calories daily, compared withthe theoretical need for 2,540 calories.It is impossible to evade the fact that weight physical activity and industrial production will be proportionately less at any lower level than that represented by this figure for the theoretical need.Earlier in this report reference was made to a reservation concerning thneed for greater variety of food.If rehabilitation of the German population is to be an accepted policy, moremeat (or other animal foods) and fat than they are now getting must be provided.Hardy and virile peasant populations the world over prove that simple dietsbased on cereals, potatoes and vegetables are compatible with good health andgreat physical endurance. Nevertheless, food habits are deeply rooted and influence our lives more profoundly than is often recognised. The morale of theGermans and their ability to work hard will not necessarily be brought backto the desired levels by merely providing more calories. These people are alreadyderiving about 80 per cent, of their energy from bread and potatoes. This is ahigher proportion than is found among primitive peasant commnnities in South-East Europe. To give the Germans more of these foods without at the same timealleviating the meat and fat situation would be an unfortunate measure.Finally, the importance of having as a clear objective the derationing ofone staple and cheap commodity, preferably either bread or potatoes, cannot be over-estimated. The provision of a plentiful source of energy (calories), fromwhich all can fill their bellies is a cardinal principle of a sound rationing anddistribution system. It provides the only satisfactory means of covering the wide range of energy expenditure of individuals within each of the specified rationcategories. Of the food concerned, bread is preferable to potatoes because it isa better, indeed a good, source of protein. But, the important thing is to have one of them in unrestricted supply. &quot;When that is attained calorie problemsdisappear.We feel it necessary to record our impression that only a small proportion ofthe German doctors and scientists we met showed an approach to nutritionalquestions that indicated objectivity and intellectual honesty. Moreover, we foundthem to be, as a group, very much oot-of-date in their knowledge in the field of nutrition and quite unaware of the fact.In view of the publicity that is sometimes given to statements by these menit is important to recognise that their opinions are rarely based on up-to-dateknowledge and all too frequently are strongly influenced by political considerations.(Signed) J.
