239(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S  GOVERNMENT)secret/CP. (48) 190 COPY NO.19TH JULY. 1948CABINETTHE SITUATION IN MALAYAlemorandum by Secretary of State fop the colonies circulate for the information of my colleagues an account of further steps taken since 1st July, when I circulated a paper (c.P.(48) 171) describing the main features of the situation in Malaya up to the end of June.2. During the first eleven days of July there was no great improvement or deterioration in the situation.   during that period, bandits were responsible for 26 murders, all but one of them non-European, in country districts mainly in the estates of Perak and Johore.   There was no large-scaleoperation by the bandits until 12th July, when there occurredthe incident at Batu Arang, the site of the only coal mine in malaya, in which a band attacked the village and murdered fourpeople.   No important incident has occurred in the few dayssince the Batu Arang raid, though there were three murders onthe following day, 13th July.Measures to meet the situation. The authorities in Malaya and Singapore have continued their action to improve the means of protection and counter-attack against terrorists.    The following additional measures have now been taken.Federation of Malaya:(i)    The regular police force is to be expanded by ,000 local other ranks and 85 officers, most ofwhom will be looked for from the Palestine Police.(ii)    A considerable additional force of Special Constabularyis being raised consisting of voluntary part-timeconstables, and paid full-time constables.    Thepresent strength of the Special Constabulary is between two and three thousand:    the ultimatetarget will be in the region of six thousand.This plan will require up to 500 Palestineconstables for training,  inspection,  etc.(iii)   A scheme has been drawn up by G.O.C., Malaya District,for the formation of jungle units for offensive operations against guerillas in the jungle.   Pour
240units are to be raised initially.   Each unit ill&quot;be officered by ex-officers of Force 136, whereavailable, and both Malays and Chinese will be recruited.   The force, which Is being given the code name &quot;Ferret&quot;, is to be raised under emergency regulations, but will be administered by the MalayRegiment and trained at the Malay Regiment H.Q.at Port Dickson.   iTo publicity is being given tothe raising of this force.(iv)    A scheme has also been drawn up by the G-.Q.C,Malaya District, for the formation of a mixedforce to operate in t he ITorthern Frontier toprevent- illegal immigration and gun running.   Thiswill probably make necessary the raising of a third Battalion of the Malay Regiment;    thisquestion is still being studied by the Acting HighCommissioner and his advisers.(As these additional police- and other locallyrecruited forces become operational, two Battalions of the malay Regiment and one Squadron of the R.A.F. Regiment (Malaya)now employed on static guard duties,  can be released for operational roles.    In addition some- h, 000 Gurkha troops nowused as guards at strategic points could be returned forfurther training.)Singapore:(v)    The situation in Singapore has up to now been agood deal less difficult than in the Federation,though there is evidence that we must be preparedfor the possibility of trouble.   The Governor isrecruiting twenty-five additional commissionedpolice officers, of whom one will be a Gurkhali-speaking officer, four will be locally promotedAsiatic inspectors, and twenty officers selected from this country.    I am endeavouring to obtainas many as possible from among the ranks of theformer Palestine Police.(vi)    In addition 600 special constables and a considerablenumber of unpaid part-time volunteers are being-raised in Singapore.Equipment of the police.I).. Measures are being taken here to expedite the despatchof all the equipment required by the police.    The authoritiesin Malaya have telegraphed statements of outstanding orders andnew orders which they wish met quickly, and already asubstantial part of their requirements has been despatched by air and by fast passenger vessel.    Three iteras are causing alittle difficulty which will, i hope, be quickly overcome.The Malayan authorities asked me for 10,000 carbines.    Theseare not obtainable in this quantity:    I have asked them toaccept Stens or Lanchesters instead and ana awaiting their reply.They have just asked me for 200 mobile v/ireless sets and. supplypossibilities are under urgent investigation.    (The need forthese, to enable forces to be summoned urgently lo- points of attack,  is obvious.)    They also require five armoured
241reconnaissance cars and 70 armoured cars. The War Office have offered instead 100 Lynx armoured cars and a reply irem Malayais awaited.   The Lynx cars can be shipped quickly.Strength of the Garrison5. My colleagues will wish to have a statement on thissubject.    In paragraphs 16 to 19 of CP. (43) 171 I gave a brief summary of the plan of operations proposed &quot;by theCommissioner-General after consultation with the civil ana.military authorities.    The plan of operations was drawn up intwo phases, phase 1 consisting of the measures required to restore law and order in the settled areas of the territory,to maintain the economic life of the country,  and restoremorale,  and phase 2 - the further measures necessary to liquidate the guerilla bands whose headquarters are in the jungle.    In submitting this plan of operations to me theCommissioner-General said that the C-in-C Par East land forces,  considered that the military forces available to hUawere, for the time being,  sufficient, with some additional assistance from the Royal Air Force.    The 1st Innishillings arebeing moved from Hong Kong to Singapore,  and the additional airassistance required, which consisted of sufficient O.P. Flightsto bring the total up to five Plights,  is being provided.    TheCommissioner-General and the civil and military authoritieshave recently assured me that they have sufficient forces toensure that phase 1 is successful.6. I have now received a telegram dated Ihth -Paly frcrathe Acting; High C oimnissionor, Kuala Lumpur,  reportingrepresentations by the leading Malayan rubber and tin interests,who assert that unless the situation is cleared up In a fewmonths they cannot guarantee to continue production, and demandas an immediate reinforcement two further brigades *    the acting High Commissioner, Sir Alec Newboult, is discussing thismatter with the British Defence Co-ordination Committee.7. The number of troops required for phase 2 asvsmLSfas already indicated, upon the success of phase 1, mid I waswarned by the Commissioner ^General that if phase 1 went badly anadditional Division of troops would be required for- phase 2.I have since seen Ministry of Defence telegram to G.H.Q. FAEBLF(COSSEA 653) of Ihth July warning FARELF that there will &quot;be great difficulty in sending reinforcements on a large scale rorphase 2,  and that there is no prospect of sending a division;one brigade is being earmarked for reinforcement should this heessential, and the possibility of sending another brigade Isbeing considered.A*C .J .Colonial Office,19th July, 19n8.
