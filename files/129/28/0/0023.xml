(48) 1736th July, 1948CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note on the more important statistics relating to the economicsituation which have become available since my last Economic Report(C.P.(48) 146).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers,Qth July, 1948.ECONOMIC report . production the index of industrial production (1946 = 100) for April was 124. It was119 in March 1948 and 105 in April 1947 (Table 1). These index numbers allow for differences in the number of days, excluding Sundays, in each month but not for holidays or seasonal factors.2. Enough returns have not yet been received to estimate whether totalindustrial production increased further in May. Output in many industries was affected by the Whitsun holidays. Production of iron and steel, motor cars,commercial vehicles and some engineering products was higher than in April butthere was a drop in output of coal, textiles, bricks, cement, and seasonally in gasand electricity.Coal3. Although production is higher than last year, the rate of output wasdisappointing in May and June (Table 2). In each of the last thirteen weeks it hasbeen below the &quot; targets &quot; set for the industry. Up to Easter output was higherthan the rate needed to fulfil the programme of 211 million tons for 1948, but since Easter it has been lower. For the whole period of the first 25 weeks of theyear output was 101-9 million tons just over the &quot; target&quot; of 101-7 million tons for those weeks. The outlook for the winter months now depends on how farproduction can be kept up during the summer and what seasonal increase will berealised this year in October and November.4. The total of 101 - 9 million tons so far this year includes production bothof deep-mined and of opencast coal. 6-0 million tons of opencast coal were produced against a target of 4 - 9 million, but output of deep-mined coal was only95 - 9 million compared with a target of 96-8 million tons for the first 25 weeks ofthe year. It is this failure to keep up output of deep-mined coal, particularly inrecent weeks, which has led to our inability to supply enough large coal to satisfy35518 B
export markets, and especially countries covered by the Marshall Plan, as wellas domestic consumers. The Production Committee has therefore had todecide to what extent exports of large coal should be curtailed and whethersupplies to the railways, gas works, industrial consumers and shipping couldbe reduced. At the same time the success of opencast mining has led to amplesupplies of small coal which at present cannot be disposed of easily.5. In the first three weeks of June deliveries of coal for export and bunkerswere 1-08 million tons making a total of 6-24 million tons for the first 24 weeks of 1948. If the production programme for the year is achieved, it is hoped to have delivered 16 million tons for export and bunkers by the end of December.6. The weekly figures of Ministry of Fuel and Power will be watched duringthe coming weeks not only to see how exports do increase but also how far stockscan be built up to meet the demand this winter. It is hoped to start Novemberwith 16-8 million tons in stock. Stocks have already been increased from13 -1 million tons at 1st May to 14 - 0 million tons on 19th June. Stocks are higherthan they were this time last year but consumption by gas and electricity under-takings in recent weeks has been relatively high because of the cool weather andthe higher rate of industrial activity this year means that industrial consumersare using more.Iron and Steel7. Output of steel ingots and castings started off the month of June witha rate of just over 300,000 tons a week in the first three weeks (Table 3) but some falling away from this high rate was expected by the end of the monthmainly due to holidays. Output in July in the last two years has been less thanin June.8. Pig iron production during the first three weeks of June was 180,000 tonsa week slightly less than in May but sufficient to keep stocks at the same level as the last few months. At the end of May stocks of pig iron were 379,000 tonsand on 19th June 376,000 tons compared with 658,000 tons in May 1947. Itis hoped to raise stocks during the holiday months to 594,000 tons by the&apos; end ofAugust but that total will represent less than 4 weeks&apos; consumption ait the present rates.9. The rate of 180,000 tons a week for pig-iron production is 37,000 tonsa week or 26 per cent, higher than a year ago. It has been made possible by a sharp increase in the use of imported iron ore, which has a higher metal contentthan home iron ore. Stocks of imported iron ore were built up during thethird quarter of 1947 but because of a higher rate of consumption they have been falling since then. At the end of May they were down to less than a year ago and were equal to 5 weeks&apos; consumption at present rates of use. Some ofour imports of iron ore come from Norway and Sweden and the United states has begun to take supplies from those countries10. Stocks of scrap remain unchanged at 340,000 tons and no further increase is expected during the next two months.Textiles11. Production in the cotton spinning industry fell in May because of the holidays at Whitsuntide but the first returns for June show that output hasrecovered and now exceeds what it was before the holidays (Table 4). At theend of May the number of spindles running was 25-6 million (counting ringspindles as one and a half mule spindles) compared with 23 - 8 million at the endof December. Output on the first week of June was 18-14 million lb. and;18-44 million lb. in the second week, compared with 16-52 million lb. a week in May and 17-25 million lb. in April. Measurement by lbs. weight understatesthe increase in yarn production during the last twelve months because outputof fine counts has risen more than coarse counts of yarn.12. Output of rayon also fell in May because of holidays. It was 18-3 million lb. compared with 19 - 6 million lb. in April and 16 - 6 million lb. in May1947. The output of staple fibre, which is included in these figures, was the lowestsince August last year because of the reconstruction work being done in theindustry to carry out the programme for expanding production.13. At the end of May 278,000 looms were running on weaving on cotton andrayon fabrics the highest total since the war.   Output in this branch of the
industry was less affected by holidays in May than in cotton spinning and was45 - 9 million yards in May the same as in April.14. Output of woven wool fabrics fell to 19-1 million yards in May corn-pared with 22-9 million yards in April and 19-7 million yards in May 1947. Ofthe 22 - 9 million yards produced in April, 8 -1 million yards were for export.II. Man-Power15. The Ministry of Labour figures for May are not yet available butfuller details have now been published for April. The number in civil employment has now risen to 19 million its highest since the war and 1 million more than in1939.Distribution of Man-Power in Great BritainThousands1939 1948J une A prilArmed Porees and Auxiliary Services   ...          480 896Demobilised, net yet taken up employment            165Insured unemployed ...      ...      ...      ...        1,270 294Total in civil employment.........      18,000 18,99516. A further expansion of the civilian labour force may take place by theend of the year when the size of the Armed Forces and auxiliary services shouldbe reduced from 896,000 to 730,000. The total of 896,000 includes 387,000 menwho are regulars or short service volunteers.17. The number of men on colliery books rose from 723,800 on 29th May to725,000 on 19th June an increase of 1,200 in the three weeks. The target forthe coal industry set in the Economic Survey was 750,000 for the end of December.18. Preliminary figures for May and June show that there was a further increase in numbers employed in the cotton and woollen industries. discussions are still going on about increasing the employment of European volunteerworkers.   The numbers placed in employment up to the end of May 1948 were : European Volunteer   Polish ResettlementWorkers CorpsCotton     ............      5,227 1,873Wool        .........-      ...      3,415 1,702Other textiles     .........      1,557 1,773III. Building19. The temporary houses programme is now almost completed. 150,335had been erected and completed in Great Britain by the end of May. considerable progress has also been made in rebuilding war-destroyed houses and in repairingwar-damaged houses.20. The number of permanent houses being completed is now about 20,000a month in Great Britain, and more houses are being finished than started each month (Table 5).All Permanent Houses in Great Britain^1)Position at end of May 1948England andWales scotland on contract but construction not begun       38,352 13,274Under construction    ...      ......      172.789 45,255Completed in May     .........        17,725 1,479(1) New and war-destroyed faorases built by local authorities, by private builders, by housing associations and by Government Departments.   Aluminium houses are excluded.21.   Between December 1944 and the end of April 1948 3,427 schemes for new factory buildings in Great Britain were approved.  Their estimated cost was35518 b 2
 172 million. Licences to start building have been given for 2,733 schemescosting  118 million. Of this total of 2,733, however, work on 793 schemes costing 57 million has been temporarily deferred.IY. Petroleum Products22. By the end of March stocks of petroleum products had fallen to theirlowest level since the end of the war. Steps have since been taken to raise stocksespecially of gas and fuel oils, and some improvement is now expected by themiddle of August (Table 6).23. At the end of May stocks of motor spirit were equal to only 4 weeks&apos;consumption at present rates of use and there were only 9 weeks&apos; stocks of gasand fuel oil.  The latest estimates of stocks are given below.Stocks of Petroleum ProductsThousand tonsGas, dieselTotal Motor spirit and fuel oil1939 August......         6,726 1,171 9971946 December        ...         5,700 742 2,4831947 December        ...         3.248 373 8961948 March......         2,948 375 800May     ......         3,779 359 1,449Forecasts June     ......         4,123 380 1,722July     ......         4,375 449 1,791Y. External Trade24. Exports rose further in May mainly because of larger shipments of coal,textiles and metal manufactures. By volume they were 34 per cent, higher inMay than in 1938.  Imports were reduced still further in May (Table 7).Index Numbers of Volume of Imports and Exports^)PercentagesRetainedImports Exports1938 average.........             100 1001948 January        ...      ...      ...              81 128February       ...       ...       ...               73 121March .&apos;...........              87 129April............              86 132May    ............              82 134(2) Quantities revalued at 1938 prices and expressed as a percentage of the monthly averagein 1938.YI. Bilateral Negotiations25. Since my last report, the Payments Agreement with Chile has been successfully concluded. This agreement secures Chile&apos;s transfer from theAmerican Account Area to the Transferable Account Area, thereby placing tradewith Chile on a sterling instead of a dollar basis.26. A trade agreement with Eire has also been signed, the main feature of which is the provision of agricultural produce from Eire over a period of four years., including 90 per cent, of her total cattle exports.27. Discussions with Iraq on her hard currency ration for the comingtwelve months have now been successfully concluded.28. Financial negotiations with Peru have now begun, with the main objectof securing transferable account arrangements.29. A delegation from Sweden has now arrived to resume the tradediscussions which were suspended last May. Negotiations for a Japanese trade agreement will begin in Tokyo on 6th July. The Anglo-Belgian EconomicCommittee will meet in Brussels on 12th July.
30. The Russian Ambassador suggested that trade talks should be resumed in Moscow: We made a counter proposal that talks should commence in London,although it might be necessary to adjourn to Moscow at a later stage. agreement to this proposal has now been received from the Russians.31. Discussions have been in progress since the end of May with delegationsfrom India and Pakistan on the sterling balances to be divided between the twoDominions. Agreement has been reached on the amounts to be deducted in respectof military stores and fixed assets taken over by the two Dominions and the capital sum payable to the United Kingdom for the purchase of an annuity out of whichthe sterling pensions are to be paid. Our proposals as to releases from the balancesand the limitations to be accepted by both Dominions on their hard currencyexpenditure have been submitted to their Cabinets. We hope to reach agreement,at least with India, this week.VII. Balance of Payments32. The net drain on reserves was  66 million in June the largest figure for any month since last October. It included the abnormal tobacco payments anda heavy drain to India.Total net drain on reserves^)1947 First halfJuly  ...AugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1948 JanuaryFebruaryMarchApril ...May   ...June  ...million467133156936759485744347202166(3) Includes drawings of United States and Canadian credits and the International monetary fund.33. The net drain for the second quarter of 1948 was therefore  107 million.No credit has however been taken in this total of  107 million or in the  66million for the month of June for  22 million which arrived just before the end ofJune as partial E.R.P. reimbursement (as a grant, not loan) iur second quarteroperations. The total reimbursement expected for the second quarter shouldamount to  75 million of grant and a maximum of  25 million of loan; theremainder of this will arrive later, presumably in the third quarter.34. During the second quarter there were drawings of  2 million on theCanadian credit and  4 million by India on the International Monetary Fund.Net drain on Reserves, January-June 1948Forecast in Economic Survey 1948 ...Net drain excluding E.R.P. reimbursement already receivedNet drain including E.R.P. reimbursement already receivedYIII.-Retail Trade  million22225423235. There is little evidence so far of any general deflationary effect on retailtrade nor was this to be expected in view of rise in employment, and productionin April and the low level of unemployment. The index number of the value oftotal retail sales declined slightly in April although there was a considerablefall in sales of apparel and a sharp rise in sales of household goods.36. A study of shopping trends in the last two or three months made by theConsumer Needs Branch of the Board of Trade does, however, reveal thatconsumers are becoming more careful and selective in their buying, and that signsof price competition are creeping back. Goods reported by retailers to be in over-supply include radios (not radiograms); women&apos;s dresses, coats and suits (not
cotton frocks or top grade utility); cheap rayon seamless stockings and importedsilk stockings; imported gloves; sheets (especially linen but not flannelette); men&apos;sheavy underwear (largely seasonal); men&apos;s pyjamas (not poplin); dressing gownsand housecoats; cheap knitwear; footwear (inferior brands); corsets (inferior. brands); wool piece-goods (partly seasonal, not worsteds); non-utility furnishingI fabrics (expensive lines); certain electrical goods (especially fires and irons but* not best makes); toys (inferior quality); inferior pottery teapots, jugs and largemeat dishes; non-utility mattresses; and kitchen cabinets.  Other reports suggestthat the more expensive tinned goods and wines and spirits are not moving easily.37. Many of the reported shop surpluses may be attributed to changes infashion and the season, mistakes in production or coupon shortages (now in partrelieved) rather than to any slackening in consumers&apos; demand. In so faras there is a slackening of demand, it is concentrated upon a limited range of high-priced luxuries or inferior goods, the demand for which was not already restricted by controls or shortages. In many cases, over-supply will quickly be correctedby adjustments of production or prices, such as have already apparently occurred to  reduce excessive stocks of certain goods (e.g., occasional and tubular furniture,plastic goods, cosmetics, low-grade aluminium ware, and expensive millinery andhandbags) which were reported even in 1947. It should also be remembered thatthere are still many shortages even of unrationed goods.38. The most that can be said from the evidence so far available is that overa very small area of consumption the inflationary sellers&apos; market may now havebeen ended. This area may grow in the coming months, but the process will haveto go a long way before there is any appreciable easing of the general pressure on labour and materials.IX. prices import and Export Prices39. There was a further slight worsening of the terms of trade in May.The index of import prices rose by 1 per cent, from 283 in April to 286 in May(1938 = 100).  Export prices were unchanged over the month.Index Numbers of Import and Export PricesExports Imports1938 Average ............ 100 1001947 April ............ 223 239May ............ 227 2451948 january ...      ......... 244 269February ............. 247 275March * ............. 248 277April ............ 251 283May ............ 251 286Retail Prices40. There was no change in retail prices as measured by the Ministry ofLabour index during May.Prices in the United States41. After the sharp setback in February commodity prices in the UnitedStates have been rising slowly although they have not regained the high levelthey reached at the beginning of the year. Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices (31st December, 1931 = 100) rose from 414 on 3rd May to 426 on 2nd june and 435 on 2nd July.
