THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT   \[113Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1948SECRET Copy No.CP. (48) 17030th June, 194831CABINETPENSIONS FOR THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS OF CIVIL SERVANTSMemorandum by the Cpiancellor of the ExchequerAFTER considering my proposals for providing pensions for the widows andorphans of civil servants (CP. (48) 148), the Cabinet (CM. (48) 40th Conclusions,Minute 4) instructed the Treasury to consider, in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned (i) what claims from other classes for comparable treatment would have tobe met if benefits on the scale proposed were provided for widows,orphans and dependants of civil servants, and for civil servants retiredthrough ill-health after short service, and what additional burden would thereby be thrown on the Exchequer and the rates;(ii) what modifications in the proposed scheme could be made in order tomaintain the principle that insurance benefits, additional to those provided under the National Insurance Scheme, should be madeavailable only as part of supplementary schemes involving substantialcontributions from the workers concerned.The Contributory Principle2. What my colleagues mainly had in mind was that, to the uninformedcritic in other occupations, the fact that the civil servant was making so substantiala contribution might not have been sufficiently apparent. I had proposed that thecivil servants contribution should be made by abatement from his gratuity on retirement. In other occupations where these gratuities are not paid (the pensionsbeing as a rule correspondingly greater) the fact that this abatement was equiva-lent to a substantial weekly deduction might not have been understood.3. Under my original scheme the Exchequer would have met half the cost,the other half being paid for by the Civil Service itself through the reductionof its gratuities. I understand that the actuarial equivalent of the proposed reduction in gratuity would be a deduction of 1^ per cent, of pay levied on allmale civil servants throughout their career. If a compulsory deduction of 1\ percent, were introduced, the contributory nature of the scheme would be quiteobvious.4. I doubt whether it is necessary to go as far as this, and I should be reluctant to do so. It would mean pressing the National Staff Side to accept asystem to which they are opposed, without putting the Exchequer in any better position than under the original scheme. Furthermore, I believe that the wholeof the point of substance which may colleagues had in mind would be achieved by a less drastic approach.5, I would propose that the scheme which I previously put to my colleagues should be modified by providing that future male entrants should continue tobe brought within the scheme compulsorily on marriage but that their contribution of an amount equal to 1\ per cent, of their pay should be payable in one of three alternative ways :  (a) By a deduction of 1\ per cent, from their pay from their entry to theService.35563
2(6) By a deduction of 1\ per cent, from their pay from their marriage andby a reduction in their gratuity of an amount equivalent to thedeductions which they would have paid from the time of entering the Service up to marriage.(c) By a reduction in their gratuity.6. For a variety of reasons I think that the reduction in gratuity is likelyto prove the more favoured alternative; but I think the fact that the reduction ingratuity was equated with a deduction from salary would make abundantly clear the contributory principle on which the scheme rests.7. Since a woman on entering the Civil Service could not be expected toknow whether she is likely to have a dependent relative later in life, the first ofthe options proposed for men in the preceding paragraphs would not be appro-priate for women. I suggest that the scheme should provide that a woman atany time during her service up to retirement could nominate a dependant, hercontribution to the scheme taking the form of alternatives (b) or (c) in paragraph 5.A bachelor would be allowed to make similar arrangements for a dependant.Repercussions of this Scheme in other Public services. I attach a note (Appendix I) which gives the results of the enquiriesmade by Officials of the Treasury and of the other Departments concerned.According to these calculations, the maximum charge to public funds if comparablebenefits are provided for widows and orphans in the local government service,including the police, in the teaching profession and in the National Health Service,would be  1,685,000 on the Exchequer and  965,000 on rates. In fact, it maywell be that staff interests in some of these Services may not wish to make similarcontributions so as to come completely in line with the Civil Service, in which case the charge would be proportionately smaller.In view of the difference in conditions of service in the Armed Forces, it is unlikely that any similar scheme could be required in those Services. If the intro-duction of the Civil Service scheme leads to a demand for an improvement in theexisting provision for widows in the Forces, the cost of such improvements shouldbe considerably less than  1 - 5 millions.9. During the Cabinet discussion, my colleagues asked for more information about the extent to which benefits similar to those proposed for civil servants were provided for corresponding workers in private employment. - I attach a note(Appendix II) which sets out certain information on this point and suggests that what is now proposed for the Civil Service is by no means over-generous by reference to what is done in these occupations. Indeed in many cases the termsof private employment are distinctly better. Nevertheless, I consider that myCivil Service scheme is a reasonable one which will be welcomed as removing along-standing reproach on the Government as employers. And I think it is asgenerous as it can well be made if the Civil Service are to be expected to payhalf the cost of it.10. I hope that, with the modifications which I have proposed to meet their point of view, my colleagues will now be willing to approve my scheme.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1SOth June, 1941.APPENDIX IRepercussions of the Proposed Civil Service Scheme on other services. It is likely that requests for a comparable widows&apos; pension scheme will come from the local government service and from the teaching service which, likethe Civil Service, have, up to now, had no such scheme. But such a demand wouldbe likely whether or not the proposed Civil Service scheme is adopted. Theinclusion of the widows&apos; scheme in the superannuation arrangements for the staff
3114of the National Health Service would, in any case, have led to requests for similar provision in the local government and teaching services just as it has contributed to the demand from the Civil Service.2. If a similar scheme were provided for the local government and teachingservices, the staff could not reasonably claim that the cost should be divided betweenemployee and employer in a more favourable ratio than that adopted for the CivilService. We have, therefore, assumed that the cost would be divided equally, asproposed for the Civil Service.3. On this basis the expenditure involved and its apportionment betweenthe staff, the rates and the Exchequer would be as follows : Total        To be paid   To be paid To be paidCost by staff      by rates by Exchequer       Local government ... 2.800.000 1,400,000 700,000 700,000Teachers    ......        800,000        400,000      190,000      210,0004. There might also be repercussions in the National Health Service and inthe Police. These services already have widows&apos; schemes but the benefits providedare inferior to those in the proposed Civil Service scheme. If the benefits forthese services were equated with those proposed for the Civil Service and theadditional cost were divided equally between employers and employees the positionwould be as follows : Total        To be paid   To be paid To be paidCost by staff      by rates by Exchequer                     National health service      1,400.000 700,000          Nil 700,000Police        ...      ...        300,000 150,000 75,000 75,0005. Armed Forces. The Forces already have a widows&apos; scheme for officersand warrant officers but no provision is made for other ranks. The provision for officers&apos; widows can only be regarded as less favourable than that proposed forthe Civil Service if no account is taken of the fact that the period of service inthe Armed Forces is far shorter than that in the Civil Service. In view of this andother differences in conditions of service, it would be unreasonable if either officers or other ranks demanded that similar benefits should be provided in the Forces asin the Civil Service. Another reason why it is unlikely that the Forces would wish an exactly similar scheme is that it would be difficult in the Forces to arrangefor the Services to bear half the cost except by a current deduction from pay.On the whole it seems safe to conclude that any demand for an improved widows&apos;scheme for officers and the introduction of a scheme for other ranks would be fora different kind of scheme from that envisaged for the Civil Service. It is clearlydifficult to estimate the cost of such a hypothetical scheme. It is estimated that ifcomparable benefits to those proposed for the Civil Service were provided for all ranks in the Forces, the cost might be some  2^ millions to  3 millions, .of which,if the Civil Service precedent were followed, half would have to be paid bymembers of the Services themselves. As stated above, however, it would bemanifestly unreasonable for the Services to claim exactly comparable benefits.The cost of any measure introduced for the Forces should therefore be well withina figure of  1-5 million.APPENDIX IIA comparison with the Benefits provided under the proposed Civil ServiceWidows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Scheme with those provided for correspondingWorkers in Private EmploymentComparison is difficult since superannuation schemes should be looked at asa whole. Very often superior benefits provided under one part of a scheme arecounter-balanced by inferior benefits under another part. Another difficulty isthat in many private schemes the benefits provided are not based on a givenproportion of salary, but take the form of a Life Insurance policy for a capital sum purchased by contributions made by employer and employee during the employee&apos;s period of service.   These schemes cannot readily be brought into the
reckoning. The following examples, which are typical of many schemes of whichparticulars have been collected, illustrate how the benefits provided in certainprivate schemes compare with the proposed Civil Service scheme : The proposed Civil Service schemeIt is proposed that the widow of a civil servant shall receive a pension ranging from one-twelfth of her husband&apos;s pay to a maximum of one-sixth of his pay, witha minimum pension of  26 a year. A widow with children will have this pensionincreased by 25 per cent, for each child up to a maximum of four.Industrial comparisons(a) The Federation of British Industries and the Association of BritishChambers of Commerce recently produced a report on retirement benefits., in thecourse of which they pointed out that business schemes are more generous thanthe statutory superannuation schemes. They suggested that the ceiling for business schemes should not be set below the standard of benefits which wouldprovide, amongst other benefits, a widow&apos;s pension of one-third of the husband&apos;ssalary. Such a pension would be exactly double the maximum pension under theproposed Civil Service scheme, though the business scheme makes no additional provision for children.  Moreover, it is an ideal and a ceiling.(&amp;) A group of five industrial firms which combine to run one superannuationscheme in fact provides a widow&apos;s pension of one-third of the husband&apos;s salary(with a minimum pension of  52, which compares with the minimum of  28 underthe Civil Service scheme). This is increased by 25 per cent, so long as one child is under 16.(c) A Friendly Society&apos;s employees&apos; scheme provides a widow&apos;s pension ofone-sixth of the husband&apos;s salary with a minimum of  26 a year.  13 a yearadditional is paid for each child.(d) A Provident Society&apos;s superannuation scheme provides a widow&apos;s pension of up to four-ninths of the husband&apos;s salary.(e) A leading Trade Union officials&apos; scheme provides a widow&apos;s pensionranging from one-fifth of the husband&apos;s salary if he dies with less than 20 years&apos;service (compared with the Civil Service rate of one-twelfth) to one-third of salaryafter 35 years&apos; service.(/) A large bank gives a widow&apos;s pension of up to four-fifteenths of salarywith a maximum pension of  200 and a minimum of  60.  15 additional is paid for each child.(g) A group of smaller banks pavs a standard widow&quot;&quot;s pension ranging from 100 to  150.(h) A large industrial concern pays up to a quarter of the husband&apos;s salaryrising to a third if the widow has young children.
