HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret .P. (U-Q)  Uk COPY NO.      &apos;2ND JULY, 19U-8CABINETCRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL:    CAPITAL punishment memorandum Joy the Home secretary the attached draft of a clause to he inserted inthe Criminal Justice Bill on the subject of the death penaltyhas been discussed with members of the Lahour Party whorepresent both sides of the controversy.    It appeared fromthe discussion that the clause as now drafted would he likelyto meet with general acceptance and would he regarded as giving effect in a satisfactory manner to the compromise to which agreement was given at the Party meeting.2. The clause provides that the death penalty shall continue to apply to murders committed -with &quot;express malice1&apos;if such murders fall into any of the following categories:-(a) murders committed in connection with certain specified crimes (i*e.  robbery with violence,burglary and house-breaking, violent affrays bygangs, unlawful use of explosives,  rape,  sodomyand indecent assaults)j(b) murders of constables acting in the execution oftheir duty and of persons assisting them;(c) murders committed by the systematic administratic?iof poison (the word 51 systematic&quot; has been inserted for the purpose of excluding &quot;mercy&quot;murders);(d) murders of prison officers acting-in the executionof their duty and of persons assisting them;(e) murders committed by persons who have on a previous occasion committed murder.3. The effect of the words in the first sentence ofthe clause &quot;committed with express malice&quot; and of the definition of &quot;express malice&quot; in sub-clause (3) is to exclude from the death penalty &quot;constructive&quot; murders where malice isimplied from the fact that thekilling occurred in the comof&quot;&quot; a felonious enterprise, inexuding, for example, such acase as that of a burglar -giving the night watchman a merepush with the result that he falls and breaks his skull.G
If,  however, a murder which falls within oneof the specified categories is committed with &quot;express mailthen all accomplices who are parties to that murder (includfor example,  the accomplice who keeps watch outside thehouse) will he subjected to the death penalty by the wordssub-clause (3)  &quot;a murder shall be deemed in relation to eveperson guilty thereof to &quot;be committed with, express malice oU. The provision relating to a murderer who hascommitted murder on a previous occasion is open to theo?jjection that if a person who has been convicted of murderis very shortly afterwards put on trial for another murder,the jury who will have read newspaper reports of his previous conviction may he prejudiced.   There is,  however,no way of avoiding this difficulty.    If the provision were confined to cases where the second murder occurs after a conviction for murder,  it would he of little value,  and wouexclude from the death penalty such murderers as Heath orGordon Cummings, who in 19U2 murdered four women within aweek and attempted to murder two others.5. The draft clause has &quot;been carefully considered &quot;bythe four Lav/ Officers for England and Wales and Scotland,and it has been agreed by them.J .C * E *Home Office, S*W.1 *?2nd July, 1943.
