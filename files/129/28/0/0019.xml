THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. ($8) 1691st July, 1948CABINETDESPATCH OF CABINET AND CABINET COMMITTEE business during THE SUMMER HOLIDAYNote by the Prime minister propose that during the six weeks from 1st August to 11th September thereshould be no meetings of the Standing Ministerial Committees of the Cabinet,and that the Cabinet itself should meet as rarely as possible.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to consider forthwith whether there are any matters on which they will hare to obtain decisions from the Cabinet or froma Cabinet Committee before the middle of September, and to make every effort to bring these matters forward for consideration by the middle of July.3. I recognise that certain questions may arise during this period, particu-larly in the field of economic and foreign affairs, which will have to be submitted for the collective decision of Ministers. I hope, however, that the occasions whenMinisters will have to fee called together may be few, and I propose that urgentbusiness which would ordinarily have been handled by a Cabinet Committee shouldbe dealt with in this period by the Cabinet itself if it should be meeting for other purposes. If any such business should arise during the period 1st August to11th September, the Minister concerned should communicate with the cabinet secretariat, who will advise how it can best be handled.4. The Cabinet Secretariat will make the usual arrangements to ensure thata nucleus of Ministers will be available for any meetings of the Cabinet whichmay have to be held.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.1st July, 194835562
