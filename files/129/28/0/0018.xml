THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC HAjESTYS GOVERNMENT.107The circulation of this paper nas been strictly ^mitc-eIt is issued for the personal use of ftTOP secret copy No.CP. (US) 16827 TH JUNE.  1.914,8CABINETLONDON DOGEWOESEBS&apos; strike memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary t-o theMinistry of LabourThis memorandum has been prepared to deal frith thesituation which will arise if there is nc general resumptionof work on Monday,.28th June.2. The general build up of the Service personnel at the docks is proceeding as planned t-o the maximum extent.     It- is,however,  impossible to expect that sufficient troops can befound to enable all the work that- needs to be -done t-o proceed.We must therefore consider the Question of finding additionalvolunteer labour.      It- must be clear, however,  that- for theGovernment itself to undertake the recruitment of volunteerlabour would create a situation of great- delicacy.      I have,therefore,  considered whether there is some alternative methodby which available volunteer labour could be utilised.3&quot; Technically, under the Dock Labour Scheme, the national dock Labour Board has power t-o recruit- unregistered dock workerswhere the Local Board is satisfied that dock work is urgently required to be done and it is not reasonably practicable toobtain a registered dock worker for &quot;that work.      In discussionwith Lord Ammon, however, I have ascertained that the national dock Labour Board would take the strongest- exception to any suggestion that it- should adopt this course.     The Board consists of equal numbers of representatives of the unions and theemployers and obviously could not- agree to recruit- for thispurpose.      The argument that would be used by the strikers thatthe Union representatives on the Board were party to the recruitment of blackleg labour would only serve t-o embitterthe situation.U* Another alternative, whilst still working within the framework of the Scheme and avoiding for the moment the difficult-decision that the Government should It-self undertake recruitment of volunteers, would be to amend that part- of the Scheme whichprohibits a registered employer from employing a dally worker otherthan a worker who has been allocated by the Local Board inaccordance with the provisions of the Scheme.     I should mention that the employers have made representations to my Departmentto the effect that- they feel this prohibition unfairly handicaps
108them in meeting the situation caused by the strike and thatthe existence of this prohibition places on the Government- theresponsibility for finding any alternative labour necessaryto facilitate the turn round of the ships.5. The object-ion to this second alternative in my view is that it requires the suspension of one particular clause ofthe Scheme, whilst the strikers are being refused the suspension of another particular clause, namely,  that relating to the powerto impose a disentitlement to attendance money.     Moreover,  thiscourse would focus attention on the question of recruitment- ofvolunteer labour.6. A third alternative, however, which I commend for theconsideration of my colleagues is as follows -The strike is now, in effect, a strike against certain provisions of the Scheme and can only beregarded as a refusal to operate the Scheme as awhole.     Accepting this interpretation,  the logicalcourse is to suspend the Scheme in its entirety sofar as the Port of London is concerned.7. This step has one disadvantage  to which I should referat the outset.      It.is that the dockers throughout the countryraay feel that to suspend the Scheme as a result of a strikedemonstrates that the assurances of permanency are illusoryand given sufficient excuse,  everything they have wen by theScheme can be taken away.      Obviously capital could easily bemade by the strike leaders out of arguments of this kind.     for my part, however, I think- that the advantages of adopting this alternative outweigh this disadvantage.     The arguments infavour of adopting this alternative are, in my view,  as follows -(l) By this act of suspension the fundamental issue at stake can be brought home to the dockers in the barest terms:(2) This threat of suspension of the Scheme and loss ofall the benefit under it may well have a dramatic effect.This move should bring home to the men forcibly that if theywill not submit to the obligations of the Scheme they must-resign themselves to losing its advantages;(3) This proposal would have the advantage of putting theGovernment on the offensive against the unofficial strikers,changing the nature of the strike to the disadvantage of the unofficial Strike Committee, and giving extra authority tothe plea of the Unions to get back to work;(h) The question of recruitment of volunteer labour by theGovernment can be postponed for a later decision.     In themeantime the employers will automatically be free to take.anysteins they like to engage such volunteer labour as they are able to obtain.      The Government would be free from the criticism that they are preventing the employers from engaginglabour and thereby holding up the turn round of shipping;(5) The temporary suspension of the Scheme in London wouldmean that it- would automatically revive on the termination ofthe emergency and any negotiations following a resumption ofwork would be on the basis of the status quo.8. It is not possible to suspend the Scheme   in London underordinary powers as any variation of the Scheme has to be published in draft form, h.0 days for the lodging of objections have to be
allowed,  and a statutory enquiry has to be held into any objections lodged.    One method of suspending it would be for anemergency to be proclaimed under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920and for an Order-in-Council then to be made giving the Ministerof Labour the necessary powers.      The Minister would then make an Order temporarily removing the Port of London from the LockLabour Scheme.      The only other method would be to pass a one-clause Bill rapidly through Parliament.9. The manner in which this step was taken and put intooperation would,  of course,  recjuire the most carefulconsideration.      In my view the first step -would be to makeit plain,  in the course of a Government statement, that as thestrike was now clearly directed against a provision of theScheme and was making the Scheme as a whole unworkable,  themen must face the fact that they were thereby placing injeopardy the continued existence of the Scheme as a whole sofar as London is concerned.      The announcement should make it quite clear that within a very few days,  if there is no generalresumption,  the Government will be compelled to take steps to suspend the Scheme in London.      Subject to the situationremaining substantially the same, it would be essential to put the proposal into action at some very short interval, say, two days,  otherwise the-effect of the statement might be lost andthe impression might grow that the Government were hesitating.This means that if the statement were made on Monday, forexample,  the emergency proclamation would need to be made orthe Bill to be introduced on Wednesday.10. It may be an objection to using the Emergency Act-that the trouble is at present confined to one port only,  andelse that the action contemplated under It is merely the suspension of the Scheme in London.      To declare an emergencyfor this local end limited objective might appear to bedisproportionate,  and unnecessarily to involve other parts ofthe country.     A Bill would be a more direct method and would more clearly demonstrate that the steps taken were under closeP arIiament ary control.N.E.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. l.,27th June, 19h8.
