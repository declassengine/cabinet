llHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1948SECRET Copy NctlOCP. (48) 15922nd June, 1948CABINETWAR CRIMES:  CASE OF GERMAN GENERALS IN BRITISHCUSTODYMemorandum by the Attorney-general  have seen the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum (CP. (48) 151). I feel bound to express my concern at it and to bring the history of the matter tothe notice of my colleagues. On the general position. I fully concur in theview expressed by the Foreign Secretary as set out in paragraph 13 hereunder.The trial of these Generals has been, as I think, inexcusably delayed for twoyears. In the course of that period one reason after another for abandoning the proposed trial has been put forward, only to be rejected by higher authority.I am not altogether surprised that the difficulties which have been caused byall this procrastination should now themselves be put forward as a ground for not proceeding with the matter. If, however, those difficulties are allowed toprevail there is no doubt that it will be said both by the Americans and atthe Assembly of the United Nations that the Generals have escaped, while theirunderlings have been hanged, owing to the reluctance of British officers to allowhighly placed members of the profession of arms to be submitted to suchindignities, and owing to the fact that, for the most part, the victims were,after all, only Russians or Poles. Criticisms of this kind have already beenmade.1. The Nuremberg Judgment delivered by Lord Justice Lawrence (as hethen was) in October 1946 stated that there was &quot; clear and convincing evidence &quot;that many of the leading German Generals were not only guilty of planning and waging aggressive war, but also &quot;of committing war crimes and crimesagainst humanity,&quot; and said that these men should be brought to trial so thatthey should not escape punishment.2. The four high-ranking officers named, who were certainly amongst theleading and worst offenders in this field, were at that time in our custody. they ought to have been, and could have been, promptly brought to trial.3. In August 1947 the United States Chief of Counsel wrote calling atten-tion to the decision of the Nuremberg Tribunal, stating that they had uneartheda good deal of information further implicating the four officers&apos; and expressing the opinion that action should be taken against them under Control CouncilLaw No. 10 and the Judgment of the Nuremberg Tribunal. He enclosed a detailedmemorandum setting out the case against the prisoners.4. On 9th September, I wrote to the Foreign Secretary and the Secretaryof State for War, informing them of the United States view.5. On 3rd October, the Secretary of State for War wrote to the foreign secretary that a strong prima facie case was disclosed but suggesting that thetrials should be conducted by the Americans or the Poles.6.   On 9th October (in my absence in New York), my Parliamentary private secretary, Major Elwyn Jones, who was one of the Nuremberg Counsel, repre-sented my views to the Foreign Office.   Apparently General Clav had at that35517
2time indicated that he did not think the British were doing enough in regardto War Crimes, and the Americans were not likely to be prepared to take overthe trials.7. On 23rd October, General Telford Taylor again wrote to me, statingthat his investigations had disclosed an ample and convincing case against certainofficers in United States custody and asking what decision we had taken withregard to the four Generals.   He added : &quot; Certain of the Defendants in the case we are preparing served underBrauchitsch, Manstein or Rundstedt, and in some cases orders which appearto have been the basis for some of the crimes committed by our Defendantswere transmitted through Brauchitsch, Manstein and Rundstedt.&quot;8. On 23rd October, the Commander-in-Chief, Germany, who had been instructed by the Foreign Secretary to approach the United States authorities with a view to their taking over the trial, telegraphed (to the surprise of theForeign Office) that he &quot; did not like &quot; the idea of these men being tried, andbad not approached General Clay.9.   On 29th October, General Taylor telegraphed  -&quot; Ohlendorf in his testimony in his own defence here has heavilyimplicated Manstein in responsibility for mass slaughter of Jews by EinsatzGruppen attached to Manstein.&apos;s Army.&quot;10. On 29th October, the Foreign Office were pressed for a decision whichI might communicate to General Taylor.11. On 3rd November, in view of developments at the United nations organisation General Assembly, I cabled from New York asking for a decision which could be communicated to the Americans.12. On 12th November, General Taylor telephoned for information and could not be given any.13. On 3rd December the Foreign Secretary stated that his Departmentagreed that the United States Memorandum proved the responsibility of the generals for War Crimes and said that they should be tried by a British MilitaryCourt.  He added : &quot; Whatever the difficulties of bringing these Generals to trial, it would clearly be wrong to let men who were responsible for issuing orders which led to the most atrocious crimes to go unpunished, while their subordinates.... pay the penalty, as many have already done.&quot;14. On 19th December, a conference took place at the Foreign Office, atwhich the Secretary of State for War said : &quot; He was satisfied that the case was strong enough to merit trial. Inspite of the fact that there was some pressure to cease trying any more war criminals so long after the end of hostilities he considered that the trialsought to take place.&quot;The Lord Chancellor was invited to consider the case.15. The Lord Chancellor immediately did so. He reported that there wasa pri?na facie case and that prompt action was required to prepare the case. this the Foreign Secretary invited the Secretary of State for War to take.16. On 23rd December, at the suggestion of the Foreign Office, I informedGeneral Taylor that &quot; it was likely &quot; that we should decide to try the Generals.17. On 26th January, 1948, the Judge Advocate-General&apos;s Departmentinformed the Foreign Office that &apos;&apos; the whole question was rather in the melting-pot &apos;&apos; because of a medical report that the Generals were not fit to be tried.Apparently Army Medical Boards had been called in to examine them and had reported that none of them was fit to stand trial! I suggested that there shouldbe an independent medical enquiry directed to the kind of consideration whichwould weigh with an English Court.18. After some delay, a Board of Home Office doctors examined the Generalsand reported on 25th March that three out of the four were fit to stand their tn al.19. The War Office then suggested that it would not be right to try only three out of the four. All should be tried or none. This argument had not previously been raised, as it might have been, to protect the underlings.
20. I have not myself been brought into, nor have I any knowledge of,what may have transpired since the Secretary of State for War, on 2nd April,suggested that all the men should be released. I should, however, not myself care to acquiesce in the suggestion that their release should be delayed and thatthey should be kept (in two cases quite unnecessarily) in hospital here until thelast date on which we have undertaken to surrender war criminals to Other PowersI had passed, so as to protect them against the risk of extradition to those states in which their abominable crimes were committed. Nor, on the other hand, doI think it would be wise to state publicly that our decision not to prosecute was due to reasons of express and administrative difficulty, or, save in the case ofBrauchitseh, honest to say it was owing to the ill-health of the prisoners. Ihave no desire to be vindictive : I am myself thoroughly sick of these war crimetrials. But both nationally and internationally our good faith is very muchinvolved. I suggest that (a) we ought to try the three men whom the Home Officedoctors think fit for trial: (5) that we should also agree to those men being sentto Nuremberg if required by the Americans.H. W. S.Law Officers&apos; Department,22nd June, 1948.
