(48) 18620th July, 1948CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note on the more important statistics relating to the economicsituation which have become available since my last Economic Report(CP. (48) 173).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers,20th July, 1948.ECONOMIC report . Man-PowerAlthough the total number of persons in work or available for work declinedby 126,000 in the first five months of the year, the number in civil employmentincreased by 120,000 during the period mainly because of the reduction of the armed forces and a decrease in unemployment.2. In spite of this increase the number employed in the manufacturing industries declined in May by 15,000 (almost all women) to 7-26 million. this total of 7-26 million was the lowest for any month since December 1947.Decreases of 6.000 in clothing and of 5,000 in electrical cables and apparatusmainly accounted for the reduction in May.Under-manned industries3. Progress in recruitment for the under-manned industries continues tobe disappointingly slow. Employment in agriculture rose further by 5,000 to1,080,000 in May but this total is still 30,000 less than the number it was hoped to reach by the middle of 1948. Employment in the textile industries, which had increased by 6,000 in April, rose by only 1,700 in May. An average monthlyincrease of 12.600 during the rest of the year is needed to reach the end-1948level of employment assumed in the Economic Survey.4. The number of men on the colliery books was unchanged in May butrose from 723.800 to 725,000 in June. This increase took place in the first halfof the month and there was no net recruitment in the last two weeks.Unemployment5. The number of persons registered as unemployed in Great Britaindeclined again, for the fifth month in succession to 274,120 on 14th June. Thisfall in unemployment was general throughout the country; the only increase was in the Midlands Region.35622 p
II.-ProductionCoal6. The output of deep-mined coal fell to 3-84 million tons in the last week of June and to 3-60 million tons in the first week of July. The latest figures show an increase to 3-73 million tons in the second week of July. This reduction was accounted fox mainly by re-cognised holidays and there are no signs yet of any improvement in the trend of production.7. The average output per man shift overall in June was 1-11 tons which,although greater than in May, was no better than in January and February.8. Deliveries of coal for export or for bunkers rose to 439,000 tons a week in the first week of July. To achieve the target of 18 million tons for 1948,shipments over the rest of the year will need to be at the rate of about 420,000 tonsa week, but it now seems doubtful whether this can be achieved.9. Shortage of shipping has been partly responsible for restrictingdeliveries to some markets in particular to Spain. Of the total shipments of6,936,000 tons made from 1st January to 3rd July, 2,985,000 tons were for Marshallcountries, 282,000 tons for non-Marshall European countries, 593,000 tons fornon-European countries and 3,076.000 for United Kingdom bunkers and bunkerdepots.Iron and Steel10. After rising to 303,000 tons in the third week of June, the outputof steel ingots and castings declined to 283,000 tons in the week ended 3rd July.This was due to holidays which will continue throughout July and August tokeep output below the recent high levels. Total output during the first26 weeks of this year amounted to 7-57 million tons 320,000 tons more than half the total of 14-5 million tons set as the &quot; target&quot; for the year.11. The output of pig-iron is likely to be affected much less by holidays andit may be expected therefore that stocks of pig-iron will be built up in thenext two months above their present very low levels.Textiles12. Production of cotton yam, after rising to 18-44 million lb. in thesecond week of June, declined to 14-15 million lb. in the fourth week, theaverage for the month being provisionally estimated at 17-2 million lb. a week.This is less than the target of 18-4 million lb. a week in June.Motor vehicles13. A record rate of output was achieved in June by the automobile industry.Weekly production of passenger cars rose from 6,643 in May to 7,231 in June.Of the total of 7,231 a week in June, 5,026 a week were produced for export, butthis still left the number produced for the home market higher than in any monthsince August 1947.14. Weekly output of commercial vehicles also increased from 3,158 in may to 3,492 in June. The number produced in June for export 1.762 a week was substantially greater than the previous record of 1,536 a week achieved in January.III. External Trade15. The value of British exports (f .o.b.) rose further in June to  134 million.Exports of metal goods achieved a new record of  63-5 million and exports ofcoal rose to  4-04 million.16. Imports (ci.f.) in June were  177 -1 million. They were slightly greaterthan in May but they were less than in March 1948, when imports amounted to 178-2 million. Imports of food, drink and tobacco fell steadily from 80-9 million in March to  71-8 million in June but imports of raw materialsrose from  53-2 million to  60-7 million.17. Table 7 shows that exports of British goods to the Western Hemisphererose in May to  23-8 million- the highest figure yet recorded. Exports to sterling area countries have remained at about  60 million a month since thebeginning of the year but exports to other c-countries continue to rise steadily.
IY. Bilateral Negotiations18. Since my last report, agreement has been reached with India and pakistan on releases from the sterling balances and on dollar requirements.19. A delegation from New Zealand is now in London to discuss foodcontracts. Agreement has been reached on the supply of batter to this country,and discussions on meat are still going on.20. Portugal has now sent a delegation to London to review the workingof the monetary arrangements made in November 1947.21. Negotiations on trade matters have now opened in London with theRussians.22. The Anglo-Italian Economic Committee will meet in Rome on26th July.Y. Balance of Payments23. A provisional analysis of the net drain on reserves during the first halfof 1948 the period covered by the forecast in the Economic Survey shows (i) The United Kingdom deficit with the dollar area was nearly 20 per cent.above the Survey rate,(ii) The rest of sterling area deficit (excluding South Africa) with the dollar area was well below the Survey figure.(iii) The fact that we have had to finance part of the South African deficit(reimbursement being naturally in arrears) has slightly increased the drain.(iv) The gold and dollar expenditure in non-dollar countries has been considerably above the forecast (mainly Belgium), particularly in thefirst quarter.24. Provisional figures for the cost of imports in the first half of 194S showan excess over the Economic Survey forecast of about 10 per cent. Receipts fromexports were slightly better than had been forecast and invisibles (on the firstrough estimate) seem to have been considerably better. The total deficit on our balance of payments account, however, will turn out to he above the Survey figureof  136 million for the half year.YL-Wage Rates25. The index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100) for ail industriescombined rose by one point to 106 in June. The index for public utilities rose by three points to 105 and the index for engineering, shipbuilding and other metalindustries rose to 102 (Table 11).26. During May settlements were reached in claims for increased wages or reduced hours without loss of pay in 10 industrial groups. Agreements toextend holidays with pay were also made in three industries. The addition tothe weekly wage bill resulting from these claims and from increases underagreements made in earlier months is estimated at  108,653 affecting 340,550workers. The most important of the agreements made in May affected craftsmenin coal mining, workers in the iron and steel scrap trade and in textiles, andpianoforte makers.27. Agreements have been reached recently by the iron and steel industryand the Midland hosiery, bleaching and dyeing trades which link wage movementsautomatically with the Interim Index of Retail Prices. The iron and steelagreement provides for changes in wage rates for a movement of one point in theIndex. The bleaching trade agreement will result in automatic changes in wage rates for each movement of five points in the Index. Three increases in wage rates in the waterproof clothing industry have already taken place automaticallythis year with the rise in the Index of Retail Prices.35622
