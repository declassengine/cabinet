W&quot; ffilS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOYEKNZ&amp;ENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1948I SECRET Copy No. 31! CP. (48) 16023rd June, 1948CABINETSCRAP INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE:   FINAL report memorandum by the Minister of supply on 6th April I submitted to the Cabinet a memorandum (CP. (48) 99)covering the First Interim Report of the Scrap Investigation Committee whichwas appointed on 8th March last under the Chairmanship of Sir GrahamCunningham. The report dealt with the German scrap situation and reeom-mended measures to accelerate the recovery of booty scrap from Germany. Inmy memorandum of 26th May (CP. (48) 130) I reported to the Cabinet on theprogress which had been achieved in giving effect to these measures. I also referred to the difficulties which had been encountered in our endeavours to placeadditional contracts for commercial scrap.2. On 1st May, 1948, the Committee submitted to me a Second InterimReport dealing with supplies of scrap from home sources. They have now sub-mitted their Final Report, which covers the whole field of imported and homesources of scrap and incorporates the recommendations contained in their second interim Report. A copy of the Committee&apos;s Final Report is attached as an annex to this memorandum.3. In approaching the general problem of scrap supplies the Committeetook as their starting-point the estimates prepared in 1947 by the Iron and steel board, in consultation with the British Iron and Steel Federation., of the quantities of scrap required against certain assumed steel production targets,rising by 500,000 tons each year from 14 million tons in 1948 to 16 million tonsin 1952. - \4. The Committee reach the general conclusion that the scrap requirements for a steel production of 14 million tons in 1948 will be- met. This conclusion isnow, however, out of date, as a few days before the Committee submitted theirreport the target for 1948 was officially raised to 14^ million tons. I think,however, that the total quantity of scrap coming forward will be just aboutsufficient to enable this increased target to be reached during 1948. though theposition is by no means free from anxiety. I propose dealing with this widerproblem in a separate paper on the subject of scrap from Germany.5. In the following paragraphs I deal with the recommendations of theCommittee as summarised in paragraphs 73 to 77 of the Report.Imports6. Recommendations (A), (E) and (F). These are dealt with in my paper on scrap from Germany. I need only say here in reference to Recommendation (A)that in my view there can be no question of limiting current steel productionbecause of the fear that the imports of scrap in future years may not be sufficientto enable the prospective increased levels of steel production to be attained.7. Recommendation (B). I have already reported to the Cabinet in cp. (48) 130 on the measures taken to accelerate the deliveries of booty scrapand the setback on deliveries which has resulted from the Soviet embargo onfreight traffic from Berlin. It is to be hoped that it may be possible to find away to overcome this difficulty. Apart from the hold-up of the Berlin deliveries,the returns for June should show a substantial increase in the quantity of scrapdelivered to shipping depots in Germany.35508
28. Recommendations (C), (D) and (E). As the Cabinet are aware, action has been taken in anticipation of the Committee&apos;s Recommendation (D) that aco-ordinating officer be appointed in Germany. General Loch, who was a memberof the Committee, has been appointed and he has already paid a preliminary visit to Germany. It will be part of his duty to ensure that action is taken on thelines of the Committee&apos;s Recommendations (C) and (E).9. Recommendation (F). Currency reform is the kernel of the problem of getting commercial scrap out of Germany. My officers in Germany are nowrenewing their contacts with the German scrap merchants and I hope that it willbe possible for some progress to be made in placing further contracts.Home SourcesCivil10. Recommendations (A) and (23). These are being acted upon. I have asked the Iron and Steel Board to look into the question of scrap prices as laiddown in the Control of Iron and Steel (No. 30) (Scrap) Order, 1943, and subsequentorders to see if certain adjustments can be made to enable the less attractive andat present uneconomic sources of supply of scrap to be tapped. I fully agreewith the Committee&apos;s view that no general increase in scrap prices is necessary.11. Recommendation (23). Arrangements have been made with the Ministryof Fuel and Power and the Ministry of Transport to ensure that sympathetic consideration is given to scrap merchants&apos; applications for petrol for businesspurposes.12. Recommendation (C).-1 agree with the Committee that no advantage would be gained at present from a house-to-house scrap drive. Experience duringthe war years showed that the results obtained did not warrant the expense,labour and transport involved. The policy of the Iron and Steel Federation andof the National Federation of Scrap Iron, Steel and Metal Merchants has been to conduct a controlled scrap drive in stages, directing its efforts in the firstplace through those channels considered best able to provide the type, of scraprequired in appreciable quantities. I agree with the Committee that this policyis sound.Defence Services13. Recommendations (A)-(F). Recommendations under this heading are largely matters which can be, and are being, dealt with either by internal actionin my own Department or in consultation with the Service Departments.14. Recommendation (A). I have invited the Service Ministers to consider how far it would be possible to expedite the declaration of surplus war stocks.My officers will give all the assistance they can to arrange for the provision ofman-power and equipment to accelerate the segregation and clearance of surplus stores.15. Recommendation (23). My officers are in touch with the War Office onthis matter and measures are being taken which will result in an increased monthlybreakdown rate of Bren carriers. The number of armoured fighting vehicles sofar declared surplus is not sufficient to justify action being taken at this stage to increase the present monthly breakdown rate for these vehicles.16. Recommendation (C). My officers are considering what additional man-power and equipment will be necessary to deal with the accelerated rate ofbreakdown operations.17. Recommendation (D). Representatives of leading firms in the scraptrade are being invited to advise on breakdown methods and on equipment at thedepots where this work is being carried out.18. Recommendation (E).-The Air Ministry have been asked to agree to the postponement of the programme for the emptying of the bombs which they proposeto retain as a reserve.19.   Recommendation (F). This matter is receiving consideration.Use of Royal Dockyards for Shipbreaking20. In view of certain developments which have resulted in additionalyards (notably Cairn Ryan Port, near Stranraer) being brought into use forshipbreaking, there is a reasonable prospect that the yield of scrap from this source will attain the rate of 350,000 tons&apos;a year during 1948
21. In accordance with the second part of their terms of referenceS the Committee considered to what extent the Royal Dockyards should be used1 for ship breaking, and I feel I cannot do better than quote in full the paragraph I in their report dealing with this matter.&quot;It is appropriate to refer here to the second part of the Committee&apos;terms of reference, viz., to consider the possibility of use being made of theRoyal Dockyards for ship breaking. They have discussed this question withthe First Lord of the Admiralty and Admiral Sir Charles Daniel, Third sea lord and Controller of the Navy. The view was expressed that such a pro-posal was quite impracticable at the present time; owing to the rapidreduction in naval personnel since the war, a large number of ships were temporarily immobilised and all berths at Naval dockyards were full.Even if berths could be made available for ship breaking, the dockyardswould have to call upon outside sources for technical experts and for acertain amount of equipment. The primary purpose of Naval dockyardswas the repair and maintenance of warships; after these requirements hadbeen met, they might be able to do a small amount of shipbuilding. Ship-breaking, however, required a completely different layout, equipment and personnel, and facilities for ship breaking did not exist in Naval dockyards.Any attempt to use Naval dockyards for ship breaking would result in con-siderable disorganisation which would interfere with the rehabilitation ofthe Navy and the normal maintenance of the ships in commission. Further,one of the reasons why civil work was being undertaken in Naval dockyardswas to enable a balanced labour force to be maintained. The introductionof ship breaking work would completely upset the balance, since there was noscope for the employment of finishing trades in ship breaking operations.Skilled men would therefore have to be discharged and it would be verydifficult to build up a balanced labour force at a subsequent date, when theNaval dockyards resumed their proper functions.The Committee feel that there is a great deal of force in these arguments.Apart, however, from the objections from the Naval standpoint, the Com-mittee are advised that there are equally strong objections from that of theshipbreaking firms. The level of wages paid to labour in ship breaking yardsis definitely lower than the pay of the workmen employed in the dockyards,who are of an entirely different grade, and it has been suggested to theCommittee that if the Naval dockyards were turned over to ship breaking theimmediate result would be a demand from labour employed by shipbreakersfor an increase in wages to bring the rates up to Naval standards. It is theview of the technical advisers to the Iron and Steel Board that the ship-breaking industry is in a position to cope unaided with the programme ofships coming forward for breaking up, so far as this can be foreseen; indeed,when the present Naval scrapping programme has been completed, in a matterof two years or so, it is by no means certain that enough ships will be availableto provide the ship breaking yards with full employment. The committee therefore do not recommend the employment of Naval dockyards for the breaking up of ships.&quot;I agree with the Committee&apos;s conclusion and recommend that it should beaccepted.Conclusion22. The Graham Cunningham Report has admirably focused the issues involved. I am satisfied that, with the assistance of my colleagues, action is beingtaken to obtain the maximum possible yield of scrap from home sources. Theproblem of obtaining scrap from Germany presents, however, serious difficultieson which I am in close touch with the Foreign Secretary.23. Having regard to the recommendations in the Report particularly onsuch matters as currency reform in Germany I do not propose to publish it, butwe shall, no doubt, have to make copies available to the Americans as negotiationswith them proceed. I am considering whether, at a convenient date, to make ageneral statement in the House of Commons summarising those portions of theReport which are not controversial and which would not raise internationalcomplications.,    .

PART I-INTRODUCTIONComposition and Terms of reference . The Scrap Investigation Committee, which was set up by the Ministerof Supply on 8th March, 1948, on the instructions of the Cabinet, was composedof the following : *Sir Graham Cunningham, K.B.E., L1.B., Chairman.Lieut.-General Sir Kenneth Loch, K.C.I.E., C.B., M.C. &quot;) Momllov.0Dr. R. E. Slade, M.C., D.Sc, F.R.I.C. j Memoers-Mr. A. E. Barnes, Principal Assistant Secretary, Iron and Steel Board(Ministry of Supply), Secretary.2.   Their terms of reference were : &quot; (1) To prepare a report on the problem of securing adequate suppliesof scrap for the United Kingdom iron and steel industry, both in 1948 andin subsequent years.&quot; (2) To consider to what extent the Royal Dockyards should be usedfor ship breaking.&quot;The Quantitative Aspect of the problem. The problem of steel scrap is essentially a quantitative one. For a clearer appreciation of the subsequent argument and of the measures proposedby the Committee, it will thus be desirable to set out at some length certain figuresbearing on the problem and their implications.4. The quantities of scrap required against certain targets for steel produc-tion (assuming that there is no building up of stocks), and the estimated yield from various sources, have been calculated by the Iron and Steel Board, afterconsultation with the industry, as follows : AssumedProductionof steelingots andYear castings(1)1948 ... 14,0001949 ... 14,5001950 ... 15,0001951 ... 15,5001952   ...      16,000TABLE I(000 tons)Scrap	Scrap available		from Home Sources		BalanceRequire-	Circu-				to be metments	lating	Process	Capital	Total	by Import(2)	(3)&apos;	(4)	(5)	(6;	(7)8,290	3,780	1,880	1,850	7,510	7808,380	3,840	1,940	1,550	7,330	1,0508,400	3,900	1,900	1,550	7,440	9608,490	3,950	2,050	1,700	7,700	7908,130	&apos; 4,000	2,100	2,000	8,100	305. Circulating and process scrap (Table I, columns (3) and (4)) derive directly from output in the steel-making and steel-using industries respectively. TheCommittee have, therefore, contented themselves merely by confirming with theappropriate authorities that the assumptions on which the figures are based aresound, and that an increase in steel output will be reflected in a corresponding increase of scrap arising under these two headings. They are satisfied on bothpointsConsideration of these figures raises the question of the availability of pig-iron supplies, which is outside the Committee&apos;s terms of reference; they have assumed that the Iron and Steel Board&apos;s assessment of scrap requirements makesappropriate allowance for pig-iron production being continuously at its maximum.6. The Committee&apos;s main pre-occupation has been capital scrap from homesources and imported scrap. These two sources must clearly be considered inconjunction, and where a shortfall appears possible in one direction, or indeedany uncertainty exists in the matter, it must be offset by increases in the other.7. The figures in Table I (paragraph 4) are minimum requirements. Duringthis year the industry hope to exceed the official target of 14 million tons ofsteel ingot production and similarly to exceed the targets for future years. while a rapidly-expanding steel production is clearly desirable in the interests of thenational economy, the effect is to increase the demand for scrap beyond the
figures stated in Table I (paragraph 4), and to make it even more necessary tobuild up stocks, both as a reserve against temporary stoppages and to meetunexpected demands from breakdowns in distribution. So long as the steelindustry continues to increase steel output to the limit of deliveries of scrap,stocks will always be low. It is for those responsible to assess the correct balance between these two conflicting requirements.8. A point arises on the question of increased targets, which will be dealtwith in more detail later on. The Committee have been asked to recommendmeasures to ensure adequate supplies of scrap. This implies making themaximum quantities available in 1948 and in practice involves accelerating the flow from sources such as Government surpluses, which are essentially non-recurrent. With such an acceleration the immediate requirements of theindustry will be met, but it may well react unfavourably on the future. Unless,in these future years, increases from recurrent sorces of supply can be assured,there is clearly the danger that even the limited targets set out in Table I (para-graph 4) will not be achieved.It is thus for consideration first whether an immediate increase of outputcan be achieved only at the expense of future production and, secondly, if so,whether a more balanced consumption of scrap over a longer period is not asounder policy.The arguments bearing on this will now be developed.9. The following rough estimate of the yield of capital scrap from homesources based on an ingot steel production of 14 million tons in 1948 and14^ million tons in 1949 respectively was given to the committee by the Iron andSteel Board : TABLE II(000 tons)Industrial Capital Sources  1948 1949(1) Normal        ............      ......      1,100 - 1,250(2) From Scrap Drive ............       ... 150Shipbreaking ............       ...... 300 300Government surplus stores ...       ...       ...       ...... 3001,850 1,55010. A general analysis of the above figures related to arguments developedlater in the report suggests as follows : (a) Scrap drive the figure of 150 thousand tons for 1948 can be accepted,but thereafter this source will in time dry up.(6) ship breaking. Certain measures have been undertaken to increase theshipbreaking potential. The Committee are advised that these should result in an output of about 350 thousand tons both in 1948 and 1949.Thereafter it seems likely that the supply of ships for this purpose will diminish. For purposes of argument, a figure of 200 thousand tons has been taken for years subsequent to 1949.(c) Government surplus stores. For reasons developed later, it will be reasonable to assume a figure of 500 thousand tons for 1948, i.e., anincrease of 200 thousand tons over the original estimate. &apos;Similarly a figure of 150 thousand tons for 1949 is likely, derivedin particular from the residue of the ammunition breakdownprogramme. Thereafter there will be supplies from these sources, but so small that they need not be taken into account in our general survey.11. In the light of the previous paragraph, a revised assessment of capitalscrap yields against the prodction targets shown in Table I (paragraph 4) is asfollows : TABLE III(000 tons)Industrial Capital Sources 	1948	1949	1950	1961	1952(1) Normal	1,100	1,250	1,350	1,500	1,800(2) Prom Scrap Drive   ...	150				ship breaking	350	350	200	200	200Government surplus stores   ...	500	150			Total     ......	2,100	1,750	1,550	1,700	2,000Forecast (paragraph 4, column (5))... 1,850 1,550Excess over forecast......... 250 2001,5501,7002,000
12. It will be noted that the realisation of the above forecasts dependsincreasingly year by year on the validity of the estimate of the yield fromnormal sources. It will be remembered that the steel production targets to whichthe above figures are related, are minima. Any increase in these targets will depend after 1949, in so far as scrap is a limiting factor in steel production, onappropriate increases in the yield of scrap either from normal sources or fromimports.13. The increases in successive years in yield from normal sources are, weunderstand, mainly dependent on the hypothesis of increased capital investment.This hypothesis may well be a reasonable one, but the element of uncertaintythrows emphasis on the importance of imports, at least until 1952, by which time, we are informed, the industry will require less scrap from all sources, and hence should be practically independent of supplies of imported scrap.14. The following table shows in column 1 the total estimated requirements for the attainment of the present production targets (Table I, paragraph&apos; 4) in the years 1948-52 of scrap other than process and circulating; columns 2 and 3show the division of this between home capital and imported scrap, as forecastby the Iron and Steel Board (compare Table I, paragraph 4) : TABLE IV(000 tons)Year	Total	Capital	Imported	(1)	(2)	(3)1948       .......	........      2,630	1.850	7801949       ......&apos;	........      2,600	1,550	1,0501950       ......	........      2,510	1,550	9601951       .......	..      ......      2,490	1,700	7901952       .......	........      2,030	2,000	30From this it will be seen that the total from these sources for 1952 shows adecrease of some 500 thousand tons on the figures of previous years. Thisindicates a trend in the right direction, due in the main to increased pig ironproduction.15. The Committee feel that, in view of the considerable tonnages involved,it would be unwise to place too much reliance on the hypothesis of increased capital investment (see paragraph 13). The more they have examined the problem themore they are convinced, of the paramount importance of imported scrap as an insurance against uncertainties in the estimates of arisings from other sources.The main source of imports is Germany. The problem of scrap from germany is discussed in detail later on, but in view of possible competition from othercountries, they feel that a bold policy must be adopted forthwith to obtain all wecan and hence that the figures given in Table I (paragraph 4) for imported scrapare not a sufficient guarantee even for the limited production targets to whichthey are related.16. Practical considerations make it improbable that we can exceedsubstantially the import figure for 1948 shown in Table I (paragraph 4) (780thousand tons) but thereafter our targets for imports should be higher.17. In an attempt to evaluate what these increases might be, the Committeehave considered the problem on the assumptions that (a) the steel production targets exceed those given in Table I (paragraph 4)by 500,000 tons each year until 1951, and(&amp;) the annual increases in yield from normal capital sources through capital investment   are   two-thirds   of   those   forecast   in   Table   III(paragraph 11).On this basis the Committee, after consultation with the Iron and SteeiBoard, assess the total requirements of capital and imported scrap in the years1948-52 at some 13,800,000 tons; they do not consider that more than 8,600,000tons can be relied upon from home capital sources. This leaves a minimumrequirement of imported scrap of some 5,000,000 tons as compared with a totalof 3,600,000 tons on the basis of the levels of production in Table I (paragraph 4).In relation to known availabilities this is a formidable figure, the attainment ofwhich would call for energetic measures in this field of procurement.
18. The Committee therefore consider that the aim should be to procureimports totalling some 5,000,000 tons over the next 4^ years, at an average rateof 100,000 tons per month; indeed in the near future a higher monthly averagemight be aimed at, in view of the importance of obtaining the maximum quantityof booty scrap from Germany at once.   (See paragraph 21 below.)Conclusions Part I19. In paragraph 7 the point was raised whether it was desirable to increaseimmediate production, if thereby there would inevitably be a decrease thereafterowing to sources of scrap drying up.The above survey of requirements indicates as follows :  ,(a) The present targets can be achieved (and indeed exceeded) both in 1948and 1949 by utilising non-recurrent sources to their full, whilstretaining imports at the figures in Table I (paragraph 4).(b) Thereafter achievement of these targets must depend on an increase of normal scrap from home sources, or of imports or both; this of courseapplies to an even greater degree if targets are raised.The Committee consider that the present estimates of the yield from home capital scrap are optimistic, and hence if this view is correctan increase in imports is necessary as an insurance.(c) If imports amounting to a total of 5,000,000 tons in 1948-52 at anaverage or, say, 100,000 tons a month, can be guaranteed, then thereis every justification for the immediate consumption of the maximumquantity of scrap from all sources.If, however, imports cannot be assured at this level, then the situation should be reviewed; the question will be whether, as a matter ofnational policy, non-recurrent sources should be eked out over a longer period at the expense of immediate increases in steel production, inorder to avoid a critical situation at a later date.The Committee have in the remainder of this report worked on theassumption(a) that imports can in fact be procured at the level of 5,000,000 tons overthe period 1948-52, and(6) that pig iron production will not be increased above the planned levelsat present assumedand hence have proceeded on the principle that so far as is possible non-recurrentsources of scrap should be consumed in 1948.PART II-IMPORTSForecast yield (Table I, paragraph 4) : 1948- 780,000 tons1949-1,050,000 tonsGermanyGeneral20. Scrap from Germany is of two kinds booty and commercial. booty scrap consists of scrap from enemy military stores, plant from war factories, andother warlike material. Commercial scrap comprises the normal arisings from german industry, and the iron and steel scrap to be recovered in vast quantitiesfrom bomb-damaged plant and buildings in Germany. It has to be purchasedeither through German scrap merchants, or direct from the actual owners.21. Commercial scrap is not flowing from Germany in any large quantitiesfor the reasons outlined below, and political objections may be raised at any timeto the removal of booty scrap; for both these reasons it is essential to concentrateall efforts on shipping as much booty scrap as quickly as possible.Organisation for collection of scrap22. The Disposals Group of the Control Commission for Germany includesamong its functions the task of removing booty scrap, and delivering it to thefading port, xhe Scrap Export Agency (S.E.A.) of Iron and Steel DisposalsLtd. (an agency company of the Iron and Steel Board) is responsible for shippingall scrap from Germany to the United Kingdom.  In practice since the Disposals
Group have not the necessary personnel for supervising the cutting, removal,&amp;c. of booty scrap from the original site, as well as loading and shippingit at the ports, S.E.A. have largely assumed responsibility for this task.23. Although such a division of responsibility is not an ideal arrangement,nevertheless the two organisations co-operate very closely and, within the limitations imposed on them by difficulties in the supply of labour, transport andequipment, are doing good work. The Committee consider that at present thearrangements are generally satisfactory, but they are informed that it has been proposed that a single co-ordinating officer, together with an appropriate staff,should be appointed to supervise and expedite all operations for procuring scrapfrom Germany and exporting it to the United Kingdom. His functions would thus be far wider than those of the officer already appointed (see Appendix A) toco-ordinate the provision of equipment. The Committee support this proposal and recommend that the officer appointed should be a man of proved ability anddrive.Booty Scrap24. The present tonnage of booty scrap being shipped from Germanyaverages some 40,000 tons per month; certain measures have been taken (seeAppendix A) notably the provision of extra equipment as a result of therecommendations in the Committee&apos;s First Interim Report. These are expectedto have the effect of raising the monthly output eventually to some 50-60.000 tons,but this is on the assumption that the shipment of scrap from Berlin, normallyof the order of 7,000 tons per month, does not continue to be held up by theTJ.S.S.R. authorities, as it has been for the last few weeks.A marked sense of urgency has been instilled into all those in Germanyconcerned with booty scrap recovery and the Committee hope that substantially increased tonnages will be shipped during the rest of 1948. and the early partof 1949.Commercial Scrap25. A contract for 100,000 tons placed with the German Scrap Merchants&apos;Association last year has now been accepted by a German scrap merchant anddeliveries have begun. Two other contracts totalling 35,000 tons have beenapproved by the Joint Export-Import Agency. Judging, however, by the slowrate of deliveries under earlier contracts, no great reliance can be placed onpromised delivery dates, nor indeed is there any certainty that these contractswill be completed in 1948.26. The issue is further complicated by the fact that American scrap merchants are now in the market on a large scale. The Committee understandthat negotiations are in progress with the American authorities on joint measures for getting commercial scrap out of Germany; the details of these negotiations are not their concern, but they wish to emphasise the importance, in the interestsof United Kingdom steel production, of early decisions on procedure followed byenergetic executive action.27. The difficulties of the present situation emphasise the importance of concentrating now on booty scrap, since there is little prospect of considerabledeliveries from Germany under commercial contracts, until both negotiationswith the American authorities for a central purchasing and allocation &quot;procedure for scrap have been satisfactorily concluded, and the German currency is reformed.Apart from a foreign currency bonus, there is at present virtually no inducement to the German merchant to accept new contracts for scrap; he prefers to keephis assets in the form of capital goods until such time as there is a stable currency,with an exchange value, and controlled prices are related to the real value of the mark.28. When, however, supplies of commercial scrap begin to flow more freely,a considerable extra strain will fall on handling and transport facilities. TheCommittee have enquired of various authorities, and are informed that transport and shipping will not be limiting factors. They nevertheless recommend that steps should be taken, in anticipation of a flow of at least 100,000 tons per month to improve as much as possible all facilities for handling and transport inGermany and the United Kingdom.It is not possible to say whether these supplies of scrap will be properlysegregated, and in suitable furnace sizes on arrival in this country; this should35508
be looked into, in order to ensure that should segregation and cutting be required,adequate facilities are made available for this work to be done, whether inGermany or this country.Further, they point out that the equipment provided for the recovery ofbooty scrap could, as this source dries up, be made available to German scrap merchants to assist the fulfilment of our commercial scrap contracts.29. The Committee consider that the Scrap Export Agency or Iron andSteel Disposals Ltd. will be able to handle both the contractual and shipping sides of the commercial scrap problem.Other Countries30. The main source of imported scrap from countries other than germany is war material of various kinds; the bulk of this is in the Middle East. small quantities of scrap have been located in various colonial territories and action is in hand to recover this. The total of scrap arising from these overseas sources in 1948 is expected to reach a total of at least 100,000 tons. A similar quantitymay be expected to be forthcoming in 1949.31. Large quantities of abandoned mining and other equipment have beenreported to be available for scrap in certain African colonies; the committee consider that little reliance should be placed on this source of scrap in planning the future of the steel industry.Conclusions Part II32. On the basis of a production in 1948 of 14 million ingot tons and in1949 of 141 million tons, the requirements of imported scrap have been assessedat 780,000 tons and 1,050,000 tons respectively; towards these totals 100,000 tonsmay be expected from sources other than Germany, leaving 680,000 tons in 1948,and 950,000 tons in 1949 to be found from Germany. As already pointed outin paragraph 17, if the target rates of production are to be exceeded, further increased imports of scrap are essential. All consequential action to procureand deal with these must be taken in a timely manner.33.   There seems a reasonable prospect of achieving the target for 1948 fromGermany, if the current sense of urgency for the recovery of booty scrap continuesto be displayed by all concerned.  Attainment of that for 1949 is, in the opinion!of the Committee, dependent on currency reform, and the setting of an adequate!procurement organisation in collaboration  with  the  American  authorities,accompanied by the most vigorous action in placing and progressing contracts.34.   The Committee are satisfied that all possible sources of scrap overseasare being investigated by the Iron and Steel Board.PART III-HOME SOURCESForecast yield (Table I, paragraph 4) : 1948-1,850,000 tons.1949-1,550,000 tons.Sources of Home Capital Scrap35. The sources of capital scrap in this country are obsolete plant and equip-ment, ships and steel structures of all kinds. It will be convenient to examinethe problems under two headings : (a) surpluses derived from Civil sources, some of which are of a recurrentnature;(b) those, such as Defence Services surpluses, which arise in the main from]war stocks and hence are largely of a non-recurrent nature.Civil SourcesNon-Governmental36. Scrap Collection. Scrap merchants are the main suppliers of capitascrap, although scrap from Government sources does not normally pass through their hands. To the scrap merchant ferrous scrap is not a main source of revenue
he makes his profits chiefly from the sale of non-ferrous scrap and re-usablecomponents. This is one reason why certain unattractive types of scrap(especially light scrap), which are uneconomic to handle, are not coming forward in quantities commensurate with their availability. The Committee drew attention to this matter in their Second Interim Report, and recommended thatan investigation be made into the present differential scrap prices, to see whetherthey could be evened out so as to enable these less attractive and at presentuneconomic sources of supply to be utilised.The National Federation of Scrap Iron, Steel and Metal Merchants have advised the Committee that in their opinion an appropriate increase in the priceof certain lighter grades of scrap would yield an additional 100,000 tons of scrap,which otherwise would probably never be brought in.37. Normal Sources. The yield of capital scrap from industrial sources in1948 has been estimated (Table II, paragraph 9) at 1,100,000 tons; this is based on past experience in relation to steel output, but allowance is made for the currentrestriction of Capital Investment. The forecast for 1949 of 1,250,000 tons assumesa certain increase in Capital Investment after 1948, but see in this connectionparagraph 13.38. Scrap Drive. The Scrap Drive of the British Iron and Steel Federationis now producing tangible results, and it is estimated that some 150,000 tons extrashould be forthcoming this year. In the course of the scrap drive the Iron andSteel Federation, in agreement with the National Federation of Scrap Iron, steel and Metal Merchants, have set up joint committees on an area basis throughout great Britain with the object of utilising known sources of scrap which for one reason or another is not reaching the steel furnaces. This organisation appears,to the Committee to be doing good work.39. It has been suggested that an appeal for household scrap would producesubstantial results. Past experience indicates that this would not be so, either in quantity or in quality. Such action is accordingly not recommended at this juncture.40. In general, the Committee consider that further efforts will not producesubstantial results unless they are associated with some scheme of price adjustment(see paragraph 36).Before discussing this aspect of the problem they here draw attention to thefact that the exhaustive drive for scrap involves considerable road travel by scrap merchants and their representatives; they recommend that applications for business petrol for the proper purposes of scrap merchants be sympatheticallydealt with.41. Scrap Prices. The Committee have considered whether a general risein the level of scrap prices is likely to lead to any appreciable increase in the yield of scrap. It has repeatedly been represented that scrap is one of the very few commodities the price of which, under control order, is compulsorily retainedat the pre-war level, notwithstanding the general rise in the operational costs incurred by scrap merchants in connection, preparation and delivery. But theadvice which the Committee have received from the Iron and Steel Board, theBritish Iron and Steel Federation, and representatives of the Scrap Merchantsis that no substantial increase in scrap supplies is likely to result from a generalrise in scrap prices. On the contrary, any suggestion that such a move was in prospect would have the inevitable effect of holding up deliveries. Further, any increased scrap yield, resulting from an increase of this kind, would be at theexpense of steel prices. Apart, therefore, from the question of differential prices,the Committee do not recommend that any action should be taken to increase scrapprices.42. Scrap from ship breaking. The breaking up of ships provides a valuablesource of scrap. The work is undertaken by firms who specialise in this trade andwho sell the resultant scrap direct to steel works and foundries. Ships forbreaking up are acquired by the British Iron and Steel Corporation (Salvage), Ltd.-an agency company of the Iron and Steel Board who allocate them under the supervision of the Board to the various firms according to the size of the ships and the berths available.43.   The Committee understand that whereas, until recently, the capacityof the industry was in the region of 180,000 tons of scrap per annum, the additional35508
facilities being provided will enable the industry, subject to the availability ofan adequate supply of ships of varied types and of a properly trained labour force, to increase its capacity to a rate of about 350,000 tons of scrap per annumThe difficulties in the way of increasing capacity which had been envisagedearlier in the year viz., insufficient cranes, burners and transport facilities-jseem on investigation to be less of a limiting factor than was at first supposed.44. The problem of providing additional ship breaking capacity will, it is]thought, be largely solved by bringing additional yards into use for shipbreakinglArrangements have been made by the Ministry of Supply for taking over the CairniRyan port, near Stranraer from the War Office, by whom it was requisitionedfor war purposes, and leasing it for a period of years to a leading firm of ship-breakers. The Committee are informed that the use of this port will providecapacity for an additional 50,000 tons of scrap per annum from ship breaking.They also understand that the use of an additional berth at Barrow-in-Furnessand the release by the Admiralty of a berth at Greenock will together provide further ship breaking capacity at an annual rate of 7,000 tons.45. As the result of these developments it is anticipated that the yield of scrap from ship breaking will attain the rate of 350,000 tons per year during1948 (thus exceeding by 50.000 tons the estimated rate of 300,000 tons quoted in Table II, paragraph 9). Due in large measure to the size of the recently-announced naval scrapping programme which is estimated to yield about220,000 tons of scrap in 1948, the supply of ships coming forward for breaking up seems to be sufficient to keep the ship breaking yards fully employed in 1948and 1949. It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy the position after 1949.There appears a strong probability of a decrease in the shipping available forbreaking up. For purposes of argument the Committee have assessed the yearlyfigure from ship breaking after 1949 at 200,000 tons.46. Use of Royal Dockyards for ship breaking. It is appropriate to referhere to the second part of the Committee&apos;s terms of reference, viz., to considerthe possibility of use being made of the Royal Dockyards for ship breaking. Theyhave discussed this question with the First Lord of the Admiralty and admiral sir Charles Daniel, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy. The view was expressed that such a proposal was quite impracticable at the present time; owingto the rapid reduction in Naval personnel since the war, a large number of ships were temporarily immobilised and all berths at Naval Dockyards were full. Evenif berths could be made available for ship breaking the dockyards would haveto call upon outside sources for technical experts and for a certain amount of equipment. The primary purpose of Naval dockyards was the repair andmaintenance of warships; after these requirements had been met, they might beable to do a small amount of shipbuilding. ship breaking, however, required a completely different layout, equipment and personnel, and facilities for ship-breaking did not exist in Naval dockyards. Any attempt to use Naval dockyardsfor ship breaking would result in considerable disorganisation which would inter-fere with the rehabilitation of the Navy and the normal maintenance of the ships in commission. Further, one of the reasons why civil work was being under-taken in Naval dockyards was to enable a balanced labour force to be maintained.The introduction of ship breaking work would completely upset the balance since there was no scope for the employment of finishing trades in ship breaking opera-tions. Skilled men would therefore have to be discharged and it would be verydifficult to build up a balanced labour force at a subsequent date, when the NavalDockyards resumed their proper functions.47. The Committee feel that there is a great deal of force in these arguments.Apart however from the objections from the Naval standpoint, the Committeeare advised that there are equally strong objections from that of the shipbreakingfirms. The level of wages paid to labour in ship breaking yards is definitely lower than the pay of the workmen employed in the dockyards who are of an entirely different grade, and it has been suggested to the Committee that if the Navaldockyards were turned over to ship breaking the immediate result would be a.demand from labour employed by shipbreakers for an increase in wages to bringthe rates up to Naval standards. It is the view of the technical advisers to theIron and Steel Board that the ship breaking industry is in a position to copeunaided with the programme of ships coming forward for breaking up, so faras this can be foreseen; indeed, when the present Naval scrapping programme has been completed, in a matter of two years or so ,it is by no means certain thatenough ships will be available to provide the ship breaking yards with full I
\ employment. The Committee therefore do not recommend the employment ofj Naval dockyards for the breaking up of ships.Government Sources48. Another field for investigation is Government surpluses other than those; which are generally the concern of the Defence Services.At the time that the appeal was joade to industry (see paragraph 38 above)a corresponding appeal was made by the Iron and Steel Board to GovernmentDepartments and Organisations controlling steel-using establishments or under-takings, to take special measures to ensure that ail iron and steel material not immediately required should be released as scrap. Assurances have been receivedfrom most of the Government Departments or organisations to whom the appealwas addressed that measures would be taken as requested. Scrap arisings wouldin many instances in particular, scrap from colliery undertakings or from therailways- be sold to scrap merchants or possibly direct to steel works andfurnaces. Hence no statistics will be readily available as to the result of the appeal, but the Committee feel that appropriate action has been initiated toobtain results from these sources.Other Sources in Public Ownership49. There are certain other forms of property owned by the Governmentand Local Authorities, from which useful quantities of scrap might be forth-coming. In this category are such things as derelict installations erected for defence purposes, material used in the construction of works services and suchsurpluses as may be derived from public works, damaged buildings, &amp;c.The practical difficulty in dealing with these sources of scrap lies in the factthat the cost of labour, transport and cutting operations involved may in somecases be out of proportion to the value of the scrap recovered.The Committee realise this, but would nevertheless urge that these sourcescontinue to be explored energetically and utilised where it is in the interests ofthe national economy to do so. -Defence Services SurplusesForecast yield (Table I, paragraph 9): 1948-300,000 tons.1949-Nil.General50. Under this heading are included surpluses (other than warships) fromthe Defence Services, Ministry of Supply Establishments and Civil Defence(A.R.P.). These sources of scrap will be largely non-recurrent once war stocks are exhausted. Before the urgent need of scrap became so apparent, theauthorities concerned with the declaration and disposal of Governmental sur-pluses were working on a programme which, over a wide field of stores, envisagedclearance of all surplus stocks by approximately the end of 1949. They wereenabled thereby to meet the insistent demands for release of man-power, but only at the expense of dealing expeditiously with their store holdings. Since it isnow clear that in 1948 the maintenance of steel production at the desired levelmust depend largely on increased supplies of scrap from home sources, the Com-mittee have examined the problem of Defence Services surpluses with theparticular object of getting a maximum yield that year. The problem is common to all the Defence Services; since the Army is by far the largest source of scrap-yielding surpluses, it is convenient to examine the situation primarily by reference to the Army.Estimate of Yield51. The original estimate of yield of scrap from the above sources was300,000 tons in 1948, thereafter dropping to zero (see Table II, paragraph 9).It now appears that these figures will be exceeded substantially in fact, duringthe first four months of the year, a yield of 250,000 tons has &quot;been achieved. Ayield on such a scale in unlikely to continue, but for the rest of the year thereshould be an increase in the normal flow of surpluses, provided certain recom-mendations of the Committee are implemented without delay. With this proviso,the Committee consider that a figure of 500,000 tons for the frill year should beachieved, t.e., a further 250,000 tons. Before indicating what measures shouldbe taken to this end, it will be convenient briefly to set out the processes wherebyDefence Service surpluses become available and are dealt with.
The Problem of Surpluses52. Military surpluses comprise those stocks held by the Services which arein excess of the authorised scales for maintenance and reserves. To ascertain what those should be, calculations have to be applied to a vast number of items,the bulk of which, however, will not produce much scrap. Considerable quantitiesof the major scrap-yielding surpluses have already been declared and the processis proceeding apace. The Committee are convinced that the problem is less oneof declaration than of -(a) segregation and clearance of surpluses from depots; and(b) where. breakdown is necessary, an adequately equipped organisation of sufficient size to deal expeditiously with the surpluses.Shortage of man-power has been a major cause of delay at all stages in obtaining the full flow of scrap from defence services surpluses. This will be discussed inmore detail later on.The Handling of Surpluses after Declaration53. Stores declared surplus by the Defence Services are handed over to theDisposals Directorate of the Ministry of Supply, who normally sell re-usable itemsand arrange breakdown of stores which it is decided cannot or should not be.disposed of commercially. Ferrous scrap arising from Government surpluses ishanded over to Iron and Steel Disposals, Ltd., who sell it to the consumer, or, ifit requires further sorting or treatment before use in the furnaces, to scrap merchants.Sales of Surpluses54. In the past, where stores were to be re-sold, a certain time has sometimeselapsed while the market was being tested. This has to a certain extent militatedagainst timely scrap availability. While the Committee do not criticise the holding of sales, nor suggest that the process has been unduly slow, they havesuggested in their Second Interim Report that an examination should be madeto determine whether in the new circumstances of the enhanced need for scrap a correct balance is being struck between the advantage of sales, with attendantdelays, and the scrap requirements of the steel industry.Types of Stores55. The Committee have concentrated their attention on the categories ofDefence Services stores likely to yield substantial quantities of scrap. Theseare : Ammunition.Armoured Fighting Vehicles and Bren Gun Carriers, plus derivativesin the form of spare parts.Machine Tools.Artillery Equipments.Certain categories of Engineer and other Stores.A mmunition56. The quantity of surplus ammunition still to be broken down is about500,000 tons, with an estimated scrap yield of 200,000 tons. The limiting factor in obtaining scrap from this source is the process of emptying, the capacity forwhich cannot readily be expanded. The completion of the programme will&apos; takeabout two years. After reviewing all the circumstances, the Committee regard this as a situation which must be accepted.Included in the present emptying programme are considerable quantities ofR.A.F. bombs, which will subsequently be refilled and put back into reserve.Should this part of the programme be deferred until the scrap-yielding surplusammunition has been dealt with, the effect would be to raise the total scrap fromthis source in 1948 from 80-90,000 tons to about 100,000. The Committee feel-that this would be a worth-while contribution and suggest that the Air Ministrvbe invited to consider the matter. There should thus be a vield of 100.000 tonsof scrap from this source in 1948 and a further 100,000 in the following year.Armoured Fighting Vehicles and Bren Carriers57. Although a considerable percentage of Armoured Fighting vehicles and Bren Carriers declared surplus by the War Office is situated abroad, there
remain at home quantities which justify special measures for disposal. Thus theWar Office have declared 14,000 Bren Carriers surplus, of which about 9,000 arein home depots.The problem is thus threefold : (a) The selection of surplus vehicles from those which are to be retained.This is an inspection problem and it is evident that inspection resourcescould be expanded to advantage, but the Army may need some assistance in this respect.(b) Movement of the surplus vehicles from the Army to the Ministry ofSupply depots. The delaying factors are shortage of drivers and, inthe case of the heavier vehicles, of railway flats.(c) Breakdown at the Ministry of Supply depots.The present facilities for tank breakdown suffice for about 320 per month,jln keeping with the principle of obtaining maximum results in 1948, the Com-jmittee asked the Ministry of Supply what would be involved in increasing theIbreakdown capacitj^ to 500 tanks and 1,000 Bren carriers per month. The[answer is that this rate could be achieved in a few months, subject to building-up a pool at the Ministry of Supply depots of some 1,500 tanks and 3,000 BrenCarriers, so that a line of operations can be established, as opposed to a processinvolving individual vehicles. In addition, certain increases in man-power wouldbe necessary. These will be discussed later, since such increases will producemaximum results only when applied to an acceleration of yield over the wholefield of breakdown. Unfortunately, shortage of transport facilities make it by no means an easy matter to create a large pool of vehicles at the Ministry ofSupply depots. It is for consideration whether, whilst utilising transportationfacilities to the full, part of the breakdown might be carried out to advantageat the Army Depots.The Committee are aware that the Departments concerned are already inconsultation over the matter. So important do they regard the expeditioushandling of this type of surpluses, which is so lucrative in scrap yield, that they suggest the War Office and the Ministry of Supply be invited to take concertedmeasures to increase the present monthly breakdown rate to 500 tanks and 1,000Bren Carriers and that any demand for increased facilities required in furtherance of this object should be afforded sympathetic support by those concerned.Machine Tools and A artillery Equipments58. It is estimated that about 20-25,000 machine tools remain surplus andthat these can be broken down in about two years, with a corresponding monthlyyield of scrap of about 2,400 tons. Similarly, there are considerable quantities of artillery equipments yet to be broken down. In conjunction with certain miscel-laneous stores, they may be expected to produce a monthly yield of about 1,000tons of scrap for the next twelve months or so. It will be desirable to accelerate the flow of scrap from the above sources and in general this means increasedbreakdown facilities.Breakdown Depots59. (a) Ammunition, guns and armoured fighting vehicles represent themain categories of specialised military stores, for which breakdown is necessary,and for which responsibility for breakdown lies with the Ministry of Supplyorganisations, as opposed to scrap merchants. At the present rates of disposalthe anticipated yield from the sources tbus dealt with by the Ministry of supply is about 200,000 tons for the year.As previously indicated, this figure could be appreciably increased by theadoption of certain measures, in particular by increases in man-power both in theServices Depots for purposes of segregation of surpluses and in the breakdownorganisation.(&amp;) In respect of the latter the Committee were informed that at theRuddington Breakdown Depot near Nottingham, an increase of 100 operativepersonnel to the present establishment of about 350 would result within six months in doubling the output, i.e., the present 1,450 tons per month would rise tothe order of 3,000 tons. This would be highly desirable, not only from the scrap-producing point of view, but also from that of economy.Elsewhere it is possible that increases in establishments might be justified,but the Committee have not had the opportunity of going into this in detail.
A further point is the technical resources at the disposal of the Ministryof Supply Breakdown Depots. The Committee feel that these could be reviewedto advantage, since even if they are generally adequate for the present rate offlow, they could hardly be so if the rate of flow were increased considerably.Further, during their visits to certain civilian scrap yards, the Committee were impressed by the use made of mechanical cutters and similar devices for dealingexpeditiously with certain types of scrap.In view of the need for maximum output, the Committee recommend that not only should the man-power situation at the Ministry of Supply depots be reviewed, but also the possibilities of employing to advantage further mechanicalresources. In this respect they suggest that it would be profitable for expert advice to be sought from a leading scrap merchant.Engineer Stores, &amp;c.60. There are certain categories of Royal Engineer and other stores, whichare dealt with directly by Iron and Steel Disposals, Ltd., or in some cases byscrap merchants. Here the problem is mainly one of segregation, the difficultybeing the shortage of man-power in the Service Depots.A particular item in this field is Dannert wire, of which it is estimated thereis still about 34,000 tons in the country. This is being pressed by suitablemachines into a form in which it can be used in the furnaces.A.R.P. Material61. In the case of A.R.P. material, it is not possible to forecast accuratelywhat proportion of this material will be turned over as scrap, since much ofit is suitable for re-use in its existing or modified form, but as a rough estimateit may be said that the proportion of scrap is likely to be between one-third andtwo-thirds of the total tonnage arising. It is estimated that there are still about90,000 tons of shelter material remaining to be recovered, but the collection of this material is becoming increasingly difficult.Conclusions Part IIICivil Sources62. The uncertainty which prevails as to the quantities to be expected from industrial Capital scrap and its implications have been discussed in Part I ofthe Report.As regards other civil sources, such as arisings from Government departments and Local Authorities, the Committee are satisfied that appropriate action isbeing taken. In certain fields it will be necessary to balance the effort in labour,transportation, &amp;c, against the value of the scrap which may accrue. Neverthe-less, the present energetic exploratory action which is being taken in all directionsmust be continued.Defence Services Surpluses63. The yield from Defence Services sources is likely to exceed previousanticipations, but this depends on energetic action by all concerned, particularly if full advantage is to be derived therefrom during this year.The Committee are satisfied that the Defence Services are conscious of theneed for declaring and clearing surpluses as expeditiously as possible. their efforts must not be relaxed.In order to avoid repetition the Committee feel it will be more convenient to develop their conclusions and consequential recommendations as to defence services Surpluses in Part IV. which now follows.PART IV-GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS64. The field which the Committee have endeavoured to survey in the timeallotted to them is a vast one. Any more detailed examination than has been undertaken would have involved an excessive delay in producing their report andrecommendations. Generally the Committee feel satisfied that the immediate problem is capable of solution in that the industry can reasonably hope that itsscrap requirements for the official production target of 14M. tons for 1948 winbe met and indeed exceeded. For future years the achievement of the officialproduction targets as defined in Table I (paragraph 4), and any increases thereto
will depend in a very large measure on the home capital scrap drive, the progressof pig-iron production, and above all on the requisite imports being assured.65. In paragraphs 73-77 below the Committee have summarised their recommendations as to what should be done both for the immediate future andas a longer term policy. They consider these measures essential to the attainment of the object and are glad to note that some of them have already been adopted and appropriate action taken.Results confirming the success or otherwise of any measures taken will notemerge for some time; experience may then prove that these measures requireexpansion beyond the scope suggested, or that further measures are necessary.The Committee feel that the Iron and Steel Board and the British Iron and steel federation should keep these points under constant review if the Steel Industryis to be enabled to guarantee in full measure its vital contribution to the national economy.Imports66. In Part I of this Report the Committee have emphasised the paramount importance of imports, the bulk of which must come from Germany. On thehypothesis of an expanding steel production, and in view of some uncertaintiesin the yield of scrap from home sources, they have recommended an import target of 5,000,000 tons over the period 1948-1952 inclusive. This is an increase of some,500,000 tons over requirements hitherto suggested-  (Paragraph 18).67.   There are two sources of scrap from Germany : (a) Booty scrap, i.e., scrap from war material, &amp;c, the total quantities ofwhich are estimated at 1,000,000 tons, and deliveries of which will,it is expected, be completed by mid-1949.(&amp;) Commercial scrap handled by scrap merchants. Estimates as toquantities of scrap from this source vary between 5 and 10 million.To obtain 5,000,000 tons from these two sources is a formidable task both inquantitative terms and due to the fact that there are likely to be other claimantsBooty Scrap68. For reasons explained below no substantial yield from commercial scrapcan be expected for the present. The immediate problem is thus to obtain themaximum quantities of booty scrap and to tap this source until it is exhausted.Generally speaking adequate measures have already been undertaken (seeAppendix A) to expand the facilities for dealing with this type of scrap. Itmust, however, be noted that since the Committee&apos;s First Interim Report, theinterdiction by the U.S.S.R. of freight exports from Berlin has held up themovement of some 7,000 tons of scrap per month from that centre.Commercial Scrap69. Under present conditions, delivery dates are quite unreliable, becauseof the reluctance of German merchants to part with their scrap. Furthermore.American competition for commercial scrap is likely to add new difficulties. It isthe view of the Committee that substantial quantities of commercial scrap will notbe forthcoming unless and until agreement is reached with the american authorities on joint purchase and allocation, and the German currency is reformed.Home SourcesGeneral70.   Broadly speaking home sources of scrap are of two kinds : (a) Industrial capital scrap of a recurrent nature, the yield from which willpartly depend on certain hypothetical considerations such as the effectof increased Capital Investment.   -(&amp;) Other sources of a generally non-recurrent nature, such as defence services surpluses, the yield from which can, however, be assessed with35508n
Industrial Capital Scrap71. The main uncertainty here is the validity of the hypothesis that therewill be a considerable increase in Capital Investment from 1950 onwards with a consequential increase in normal capital scrap. By this time the bulk of thenon-recurrent sources will have been consumed. Hence much depends on whetherCapital Investment will in fact produce the considerable tonnages of scrap whichwill be required from home sources after 1949 unless imports be increased. It is largely owing to uncertainty in this important matter that the Committee have recommended a considerable increase in the imports programme (see paragraph 66above).Other Sources72. As already explained the yield from these sources in most cases can be assessed with more accuracy. The position as regards anticipated yield may besummarised as follows :-194:8 1949     Subsequent years(a) Defence Services Surpluses, including a HP ............      500,000 150,000 negligiblelb) Shipbreakirig............      350,000 350,000 200,000(c) Scrap Drive    ............       150,000 ? ?The above yields are dependent on certain measures being taken, which areoutlined by the Committee in their recommendations (see paragraph 75 below).There are other sources of scrap such as those which it is hoped to tap bythe appeal to local authorities (see paragraph 49) but it is not possible to assesswhat yield may be expected therefrom. In addition the adjustments of price levels in order to tap certain sources of scrap now considered uneconomic by the scrap merchants (see paragraph 36) would, it is thought, produce a further 100,000tons. It is, however, abundantly clear that a maximum yield in all these directionsis essential in 1948 in order to give time for imports to be developed to the full.Summary of RecommendationsGeneral73. The Committee are conscious of a sense of urgency on the part of allconcerned in obtaining scrap. The matter is being energetically- pursued inmany directions and the results so far are encouraging.They would emphasise that these efforts must not be relaxed until adequate supplies of scrap are assured.Imports74. (A) The target for imports from Germany during the five years 1948-52should be 5,000,000 tons (paragraph 18).If imports cannot be assured at this level, the situation shouldbe reviewed to see whether, as a matter of national policy, non-recurrent sources should be eked out over a longer period, atthe expense of immediate increases in steel production, in order toavoid a critical shortage at a later date (paragraph 19).(B) All possible steps should continue to be taken to accelerateimmediately deliveries of booty scrap (paragraph 21) and particu-larly to obtain the release of booty scrap from the United Kingdomsector of Berlin (paragraph 24).(C) Preparations for improved handling, cutting, segregation,loading and transport of scrap should be made in anticipation ofan increased flow of commercial scrap from Germanv (para-graph 28).(D) A co-ordinating officer with appropriate staff should be appointed in Germany forthwith, to supervise and expedite all arrangements in that country for scrap procurement on behalf of the UnitedKingdom (paragraph 23).(E) Negotiations with the American authorities and joint measures for getting commercial scrap out of Germany should be pressed forward. Decisions on procedure should be followed by energeticexecutive action (paragraph 26).(F) The Committee emphasise the importance of currency reform inbizonal Germany in its bearings on negotiations with Germanscrap merchants (paragraph 27).
Home SourcesCivil75. (A) An investigation should be made into present differential scrapprices to see whether they could be evened out so as to enable lessattractive and uneconomic sources of supply to be tapped (para-graph 36), but no general increase in scrap prices is necessary(paragraph 41).(B) Applications by scrap merchants for business petrol should be. sympathetically dealt with (paragraph 40).(C) A house-to-house scrap drive would not at present be advantageous(paragraph 39).Defence Services76.   Ministries should be invited to take action as follows: (A) Whilst making every endeavour to expedite the declaration offurther surpluses, the Defence Services to indicate their needs inman-power and equipment in order to hasten the segregation andclearance of surpluses already declared (paragraph 52).(B) The War Office and Ministry of Supply to take concerted actionto increase the monthly breakdown rate of Armoured fighting vehicles and Bren Carriers (paragraph 57).(C) The Ministry of Supply to indicate the increases in resources ofman-power and equipment necessary to enable their breakdownorganisations to cope with the increased flow arising out of (A)and (B) above (paragraphs 57 and 59).(D) The Ministry of Supply to consult with the scrap trade as to possible improvements in breakdown methods and equipment atthe Ministry&apos;s Depots (paragraph 59).(E) The Air Ministry to consider whether they can defer the bomb-emptying programme now being undertaken for reserve purposes,thus releasing Ministry of Supply emptying capacity for dealingwith scrap-yielding surplus ammunition (paragraph 56).(F) The Ministry of Supply to examine whether in present cireum-stances a correct balance is being struck between the advantages ofthe sale of surplus stores and the urgency of the need for scrap(paragraph 54).Royal Dockyards77. With regard to the second part of their terms of reference, the Com-mittee do not recommend the use of Naval Dockyards for ship breaking (para-graphs 46^7).PART V.-ACKNOWLEDGMENTS78.
