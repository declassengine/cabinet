(48) 15217th June. 1948CABINETGRAIN SUPPLIES FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM, 1948-49Memorandum by the Minister of food the memorandum annexed to this paper reviews our overall cereals position,and draws particular attention to those features which are important and tothe major issues on which decisions will require to be taken at an early date.Against that background I have given careful thought to the question how wecan use the substantial supplies of grain in, prospect to the best advantage.2. In the first place the urgency of de-rationing bread has now become,from an administrative point of view, very great indeed. The blunt truth isthat unless we soon de-ration bread it will de-ration itself. It would mean a major administrative effort, quite unjustifiable in the present supply position,to reinforce bread rationing. Short of such an effort, however, the scheme becomesweek by week more and more lax, and it is having a gravely demoralisingreaction upon all other rationing schemes. My Parliamentary Secretary reports to me that during my recent absence in East Africa it has become more and moredifficult to defend the continuation of the scheme in the House, since labour members of Parliament know that their own wives are not surrendering BUs.I have myself found the same difficulty since my return. Moreover, if we removebread rationing after it has become a complete dead letter, we shall lose allthe advantage of being able to show that we remove restrictions the momentthey become unnecessary.3.   But the desirability of de-rationing bread and flour as early as possible is only one factor in the overall cereals position; it must be clearly considered,in my view, in conjunction with the following further factors in the situation : (a) Our present and prospective stocks of wheat and flour from now untilthe end of the next crop year (end June, 1949).   (This raises thequestion whether our own farmers should be required to deliver all their millable wheat, or whether they should be allowed to retain20 per cent.);(6) The flour extraction rate;(e) The present restrictions on human consumption of oatmeal and othercereal products: and(d) Our prospective supplies of coarse grains up to the end of the comingcrop year.These factors are considered in the following paragraphs.Wheat and Flour Supplies4. The basis on which wheat and flour import requirements for 1948-49hare been stated for European Recovery Programme and International EmergencyFood Council purposes has been (a) a weekly flour off take of 103,000 tons (the average in the six months beforerationing was introduced);(o) the maintenance of the present extraction rate (85 per cent.) up to theend of 1948 and a reduction of the rate to 80 per cent,   from 1st January, 1949;(c) that our farmers would be allowed to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat from the 1948 crop.35493%
On this basis supplies of wheat and flour which we are reasonably certain toobtain from Canada and Australia, together with the home crop, should besufficient to give us a carry-over bulk stock of 5 -1 weeks&apos; cover at the end ofJune, 1949.   This, however, is 3-9 weeks (502,000 tons) less than the minimumconvenient carry-over of 9 weeks&apos; supply, on which our plans should be based.  Ofthis deficit of 502,000 tons about 226,000 tons could be covered by continuing the extraction rate at its present level, leaving a deficit of 276,000 tons to be covered in order to secure our supply position.   The additional supplies willhave to be obtained either by additional purchases from Russia or the Argentineor by requiring our own farmers to deliver all their millable wheat as in previous years.   The Minister of Agriculture would prefer that the additional wheatshould be purchased overseas and farmers allowed to retain 20 per cent, oftheir crop.   While I appreciate his reasons. I regard the prospect of our being able to obtain what we need from either Russia or the Argentine as being toouncertain, and I feel that the only assured means of bridging the gap is by requiring farmers to deliver all their millable wheat.   The Chancellor of theExchequer will not, I presume, be anxious to attempt to resume purchases ofwheat in the Argentine owing to the financial difficulties, and the exorbitant pricesAvhich the Argentines have been asking; we may be able to obtain Russian wheaton better terms, and should, in my view, attempt to do so in the forthcoming negotiations.  But the possibility is too uncertain at the present stage to be madethe basis of important decisions.   Furthermore, we shall put ourselves in anindefensible position if we allow the feeding of hundreds of thousands of tonsof millable wheat to animals while we have no complete assurance of being ableto buy abroad sufficient wheat to maintain the bread supplies of our people ata sufficient level until the next harvest.  The forward supply position for coarse grains, which is dealt with more fully in paragraph 5 below, is, however, such that we can well afford to replace the 20 ner cent, of millable wheat which farmershave been promised from the 1948 crop by the release of an equivalent quantityof imported coarse grains.   The Minister of Agriculture has always been most careful in his pledges to farmers to reserve this option.  A decision as to whether we shall do this must be taken at once, and should be announced simultaneously with the de-rationing of bread.Coarse Grains5.   On the assumption that the full 750,000 tons of coarse grains providedfor in our current agreement with Russia are shipped by the end of September(which now seems probable) and if the present rate of utilisation is maintained,we should accumulate a stock of about 1 million tons of coarse grains at theend of April 1949, which is about 600,000 tons above the normal carry-over stock.The prospect of having to carry so large a stock, which largely results from the suspension of the livestock expansion programme, raises very serious problems.Suitable storage accommodation is limited and, while it may be possible to im-provise storage space, - large quantities of maize would have to be bagged andmoved into store away from the ports to airfields and the like.   This would be expensive.  Moreover, some of the imported maize is of poor keeping quality andwill not store well.   There would, therefore, be substantial loss by deterioration of quality and weight, though the extent cannot be estimated.   In these circum-stances, we might very well be compelled to accelerate the release of importedgrain so that if farmers were allowed to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat,we should also have to issue as much additional coarse grain for animal feed aswe should be committed to release in substitution for wheat if we required allhome-grown wheat to be delivered.   The possibility that we might be underpressure to divert some of our increasing stocks to other countries should also beborne in mind, especially if we make a contract with Russia for further substantialsupplies.   If these additional supplies should be forthcoming the present rate ofshipment of coarse grains of about 100,000 tons a month would possibly continuefrom October onwards and our stocks of coarse grain at the end of April wouldbe increased from the 1 million tons referred to above to some 1-6 million tons.In these circumstances, it seems to me that we must take steps to increase therate of off take of coarse grains at an early date by some arrangements whichwill not involve any continuing commitment to an increase in the level of animal feeding which it might be impossible to maintain.   (The only supplies of coarse grains due to arrive in the United Kingdom affcr  the end of April, 1949from purchases already made are 200,000 tons from the Argentine, whichshould arrive before the end of June, 1949.   Until we know the result ofthe forthcoming Russian negotiations we cannot estimate what supplies we are
likely to obtain from Eussia to meet our animal feeding-stuffs&apos; requirements inthe second half of 1949 and thereafter.) Farmers have already been given per-mission to retain 20 per cent, of their barley and 20 per cent, of their millable wheat (or to receive coarse grains in substitution) from the 1948 crop; these concessions, together with the increase in the acreage of dredge corn in recentyears, represent a considerable increase in supplies of feeding-stuffs. I, therefore,suggest that the increased rate of off take from Ministry of Food stocks whichthe prospective supply position necessitates, should be achieved by the proposals in the following paragraph.6. Taking all the above factors into consideration, I propose that thefollowing steps should be taken as soon as is administratively practicable (thefigures in brackets show the estimated cost to Ministry of Food stocks of coarse grains in the period up to the end of April 1949) : (i) the de-rationing of bread, with the consequential removal of the restric-tion on the service of bread in restaurants (nil);(ii) the removal of oatmeal from points rationing (60,000 tons);(iii) continuation of the recent freeing of barley products from pointsrationing (nil);(iv) a small increase in the usage of maize and a corresponding reductionin the use of wheat for breakfast cereals (20,000 tons);(v) farmers should be required to deliver all their millable wheat fromthe coming crop and should receive coarse grains in lieu of the 20 percent, which they were promised they could retain (353,000 tons, against which we should collect 285,000 tons of wheat); and(vi) the maintenance of the present extraction rate till the end of June 1949,unless we obtain additional supplies from Russia or elsewhere.7. The proposals under (i) to (iii) are all desirable in themselves, but, in my view, should be considered together because the de-rationing of bread might beheld to hold the element of risk that some bread or flour may be used for animal feeding unless the two succeeding proposals are put into effect at the same time.As an additional safeguard, however, and also in order to meet any objectionfrom abroad to our de-rationing bread, I would recommend the introduction of ascheme by which weekly off take of flour is restricted to 100,000 tons (about thepresent figure) using the balance of 3,000 tons a week as a cushion to meethardship cases and such local or seasonal difficulties as may arise. This scheme would, in addition, be so devised as to prevent altogether the purchase of flourin bulk for animal feed by farmers or the general public. Our present estimates of flour consumption are all based on an off take of 103,000 tons a week. Underthis arrangement, therefore, we should be able to de-ration bread without having to allow for any increased consumption in this country. This point would be ofconsiderable importance in relation to international opinion both in America and elsewhere. In any case the harvest prospect in both Western Europe and theUnited States is now so assured and so favourable that I doubt whether we shall receive any criticism for de-rationing. The European countries will probably bede-rationing themselves in the near future. We should, I suggest, inform theUnited States Government of what we are going to do.8. I ask for the agreement of my colleagues to the proposals contained inparagraph 6 above. I suggest 1st July as the appropriate date for the announce-ment of the de-rationing of bread and of the other measures proposed in para-graph 6 and for the adoption of a scheme to control the off take of flour from the mills as recommended in paragraph 7.J.

ANNEXBEE AD GRAINS AND COAESE GRAINSUnited Kingdom Position, 1948-49During recent months a number of factors have combined to complicate ourvarious assessments of the forward supply position as related to bread grains and coarse grains and to prevent the adoption of a firm utilisation programme fora substantial period ahead. As, however, &apos;&apos; Marshall Aid &apos;&apos; is now assured andsome of the doubtful supply factors seem less uncertain, it is thought desirable to review the position afresh and to resolve, as far as may be practicable, theproblems which still remain.2. Wheat and Flow. It now seems clear that &quot; off-shore &quot; assistance underthe European Recovery Programme will be available to finance our purchases ofwheat and flour from Canada during the cereal year 1948-49. This assures thebulk of our import requirements for that year, and, when allowance has been madefor the arrivals which may be reasonably expected from Australia., it is nowpossible to estimate the balance required to meet consumption requirements andto provide a satisfactory stock level throughout the year. (A statistical table,with explanatory notes, is given in Appendix I.) For the purpose of the &quot; M &quot;programme of wheat /flour requirements (rationed basis), which was prepared onthe assumption that assistance under the European Recovery Programme wouldbe available, the flour off take was estimated at 103,000 tons a week with flourextraction rate of 85 per cent, up to the end of December 1948, and 80 per cent,thereafter. On this basis and assuming imports of wheat and flour only fromalready assured sources and receipts of wheat from the home crop equalling about61 per cent, or 1,347,000 tons (after 20 per cent, retention has been allowed for)during the next crop year, we should have a combined stock of wheat and flourat end June 1949 of about 5-1 weeks&apos; supply. This is well below a workablelevel even under controlled off take and well short of the prudent level if offtakewere unrestricted. A much more satisfactory supply position could be assured,however, if the following measures were adopted : the substitution of coarse grains in lieu of the proposed 20 per cent,retention of millable wheat by home farmers. This would provide anadditional 265,000 tons of wheat (see paragraphs 5 and 6 below);the continuation of the extraction rate at 85 per cent, after 31st December,1948, which would save 177,000 tons of wheat in the first six monthsof 1949.On this basis the combined bulk stocks of wheat and flour at end June 1949would equal 8-9 weeks&apos; supply, i.e., only slightly below the desired nine weeks&quot;working stock.The foregoing appraisement does not provide for the unrestricted use of bread and flour, and if rationing were abolished at the end of June 1948 andno steps were taken to restrict the off take of flour it is prudent to assume thatdeliveries from mills might reach 106,000 tons of flour a week, which would increase wheat import requirements by about 200,000 tons during 1948-49. Pro-vision would also be necessary for correspondingly larger stocks. A restriction ondeliveries of flour by millers, however, could be introduced in place of the presentbread rationing scheme, and off take could be limited thereby to a TnaYimmm of103,000 tons a week. Supplies to bakers would be fixed by reference to a pre-determined datum usage, but to meet seasonal fluctuations in trade they would be permitted to draw supplies up to any amount during quarterly or other periods,provided always that the total taken during the period did not exceed datumusage. The adoption of this scheme and the de-rationing of bread should be preceded by the removal of oatmeal from the points rationing scheme and bv some increase in the supply of cereal breakfast foods.
3. Coarse GroAns.-The forward supply position for coarse grains (esti-mated as at 24th May) is set out in Appendix II. This shows that, on theassumption (i) that the home crop will be harvested under normal conditions;(u) that United Kingdom farmers will be permitted to retain 20 per cent, ottheir wheat crop and there is no substitution of coarse grams;(iii) that the whole of the 750,000 tons of grain covered by the Anglo-Russian Agreement of December, 1947 is received by October, 1948;(iv) that 1 million tons of the 1-2 million due under the Andes agreement will arrive bv the end of April, 1949; and(v) that off take for all purposes remains at present levels;stocks of coarse grains in the United Kingdom will increase to about 1 million tons at the end of October, and will remain at about that level until April, 1949.This would be about 600,000 tons above the prudent stock level. Such a largestock arises from the postponement of the programme of increased ration issuesfor animal feeding, which it was hoped would become effective from 1st May,1948, and the delay in restoring the cuts in human and industrial usage. Itwas. however, a condition precedent to the introduction of the expansion pro-gramme that stocks in the United Kingdom and supplies in sight should beadeouate to meet the estimated increase in off take over a reasonably long period a condition -which could not be fulfilled in face of the uncertainties referred tobelow. It should also be noted that, apart from the 200,000 tons of Argentinemaize expected to arrive in May/June/1949 (see 3 (iv) above), no arrangements have been made for the supply of the further quantities of coarse grains whichwill be required during the latter part of 1949 and the following years to meet requirements for human, industrial and animal feeding purposes. Moreover, inview of the statement by the Minister of Agriculture in the House of commons on 25th March, any increase in the issue of feeding-stuffs implies a commitment on the Government to continue to make supplies available at the increased rate of off take for several years.4. (a) Russia. Of the 750,000 metric tons of grain included in the Anglo-Russian Agreement of December, 1947, the Russians may withhold 200,000 tons.For the purpose of this memorandum, however, it has been assumed that thewhole of the 750,000 tons will be received. The Protocol provides that not later than May 1948 the parties shall meet to discuss the implementation ofthe agreement and draw up a balanced programme of shipments of coarse grains and wheat between the two countries. In this connection a further 1 - 5 million tonsof all grains has been mentioned. If a new agreement is concluded we may wellcontinue to receive heavy arrivals perhaps at the present rate of about 100,000tons a month from Russia and the Argentine simultaneously until the last of the Argentine shipments under the Andes Agreement have &quot;been completed.Stocks would then increase above the figures shown in Appendix II and storageproblems would be aggravated.(b) Argentina. Previous estimates of the quantity of coarse grain likely tobecome available for consumption in the United Kingdom under the AndesAgreement allow for 240,000 metric tons for Eire and 107,000 metric tons forBritish Services Overseas and for British interests in the Middle East. Eirehas not accepted the 240,000 metric tons and about 55,000 ,metrie tons of thequantity previously earmarked for the Services and the Middle East is nowsurplus to their requirements. On this basis a total of 1-2 million tons of argentine grain should be received in the United Kingdom by June, 1949.5. Farmers&apos; Retention. It was decided by the Economic Policy Committeeon 5th January, 1948 (E.P.C. (48) 1st Meeting, Minute 1) that :-(a) Farmers would be free to retain for stock feeding 20 per cent, of theirbarley from the 1948 harvest.(b) It was hoped that farmers might be similarly, free to retain 20 per cent.of their 1948 wheat crop but they should understand that, if thereshould be an acute shortage of wheat for human consumption in1948-49, the Government might find it necessary to require them toaccept an equivalent ration of coarse grains in substitution for that20 per cent, of wheat.An early decision on the question whether growers are to be allowed to retainwheat from the 1948 crop or to receive coarse grains (or other feeding-stuffs) in
substitution is necessary in order to make an appreciation of the forward position.Growers also are anxious to know definitely what their position will be. It shouldbe emphasised, therefore, that, if the substitution scheme is adopted, it will take some time to have forms printed and to make the necessary arrangements for putting the scheme into effect. For administrative reasons it would be impossibleto introduce it after the new cereal year has begun on 1st August.6. The effect of the alternatives referred to in 5 (b) above may be statedas follows : (a) Since some farmers are already illegally retaining part of their millable wheat, it is probable that permission to retain 20 per cent, will not result in a reduction of millers&apos; receipts by the full amount. It hasbeen assumed in paragraph 2 above and in the statistical table inAppendix I that millers&apos; receipts would be reduced from 73 per cent,(the average of the last six years) of the crop to 61 per cent, or1,347,000 tons).(6) On the other hand, if growers are required to sell all their millable wheat in return for an equivalent quantity of coarse grains (or otherfeeding-stuffs), it is reasonable to assume that millers&apos; receipts in1948-49 will not differ materially from the average of the past six years, i.e., 73 per cent, of the crop or 1,612,000 tons. This figure is 265,000 tons higher than the quantity of home grown wheat usedfor the statistical forecast in paragraph 2, and its effect would be toraise stocks at the end of June, 1949 by 2 weeks&apos; supply.(c) The quantity of coarse grains (or other feeding-stuffs) required to corn-compensate growers if they are required to sell all their millable wheatwill depend on the actual quantity of millable wheat sold off farms.Total sales of wheat (including seed) to approved buyers during thepast six years have averaged 81 per cent, of the crop and, after makingallowance for non-millable wheat, about 80 per cent, of the wheat cropmust be taken into account in estimating the cost of replacement. Thequantity of coarse grains required for this purpose would be 353,000tons.(d) Although it must be assumed that growers will sell 81 per cent, of theirwheat crop as they have done on average in the past six years this may not be the case. Some growers may endeavour to retain 20 percent, of their millable wheat and at the same time claim replacementsin respect of the quantity sold off the farms; in this connection it maybe pointed out that when growers are allowed to retain any millable wheat it will be very difficult to ensure that the retention of millable wheat is in fact restricted to 20 per cent, in individual cases. More-over, it is thought that many farmers would take up their entitlement to coarse grains in substitution even if they had sufficient feeding-stuffs otherwise, whereas these farmers who grow wheat as a sale cropwould not necessarily retain the full 20 per cent, allowed under aretention scheme.(e) Although, therefore, we may reasonably expect that the substitution of coarse grains would raise millers&apos; receipts to 1,612,000 tons therecan be no absolute guarantee that this will be so. To the extent thatthis estimate is not realised, the replacement scheme will not entirelyachieve its object. Moreover, since the Ministry of Food would beissuing 350,000 tons of coarse grains against the expectation of anincrease of 265,000 tons in millers&apos; receipts of wheat, the substitutionwould cost 88,000 tons more of all grains unless there is an unexpectedlylarge increase in total sales by growers as compared with previous years.(/) The financial cost of the substitution scheme would be more than thatof the retention scheme but the amount would depend on the extentto which special storage arrangements are minimised by the substitu-tion scheme. Under the latter, however, a subsidy would have to bepaid both on the 265,000 tons extra home grown wheat to be receivedby millers and on the 350,000 tons of coarse grains issued to farmers;whereas, if growers retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat, while there is still a subsidy to be paid on the necessary additional importsof wheat or flour, no subsidy will be payable on the wheat which the farmers will retain for feed.
1,789 811,767 801,612 731,347 61The following is a tabular statement of the effect of the alternatives on wheat and coarse grain supplies : 1.

Net saving in cereals if 20 per cent, wheatretention is allowed      ...      ...      ...      ... 88(g) Subject to the considerations mentioned in paragraph 7, therefore, itwould be preferable, both from the point of view of the most economicaluse of our total cereals supplies and also from the financial pointof view, to allow farmers to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat;but our over-riding need is to maintain our bread and flour suppliesthrough the cereals year 1948-49. To do this we require the wholeof the home wheat crop unless we can make purchases of wheatoverseas additional to those presently contemplated from Russia andwhich will be delivered with certainty by the end of 1948 or thebeginning of 1949.7. Even with the increased utilisation of coarse grains which would result from issuing coarse grains to farmers in lieu of wheat, the heavy accumulation of stocks which will take place during the coming months may prove to be verydifficult indeed to carry, and it is not improbable that we may be under pressure to make some part of them available to other countries. Suitable storage accom-modation in the United Kingdom is limited and special arrangements may haveto be made to cope with the grain from the home crop in addition to the large volume of imported grain. While it may be possible to improvise storage space,large quantities of maize will have to be bagged and moved into store away fromthe ports. This will be expensive. Moreover, some of the imported maize isof poor keeping quality and will not store well. There will, therefore, be some loss by deterioration of quality and weight, but the extent cannot be estimated.In these circumstances pressure to release additional supplies to farmers for animal feeding may be considerable.8. From what has been said above it will be seen that it is impossible atthis date to make a comprehensive and dependable review of the United Kingdom&apos;scereal supply position for 1948-49. The two major factors which are stilluncertain are : (a) the outturn of the 1948 harvest; and(b) the extent of which we are able to arrange for continuing supplies of grain from Russia when shipments under the current agreement cometo an end.In these circumstances it would be imprudent to put forward now a compre-hensive set of recommmendations for the utilisation of all our prospective supplies in the coming crop year. Two matters, however, call for policy decisions whichcannot be postponed. The first is the de-rationing of bread and flour on whichthere has already been a good deal of speculation in the press and on whichquestions have been asked in Parliament. Second, the rapid accumulation of coarse grain stocks which will take place in the next few months will necessitatesome increase in the rate of consumption, even though the longer term supplyprospects are still too obscure to enable us to say that a substantial increasein the existing level of animal feeding can be maintained. It is suggested thatthe most practical way to deal with this situation would be : (i) to le-ration bread and flour, while pegging flour off take from mills atnot more than 103,000 tons a week;
(ii) to remove the present restrictions on the consumption of oatmeal andoat products, continue this relaxation in the case of barley products and increase the supply of other cereal breakfast foods,(iii) to require farmers to deliver all their millable wheat from the 1948harvest and to issue coarse grains on the basis set out in paragraph 6.Of the above measures (i) would get rid of the tiresome and now largelyineffective bread and flour rationing scheme without increasing flour consumption.As regards the proposal at (ii), oatmeal and barley products were brought withinthe scope of the points rationing scheme at the same time as bread rationingwas introduced, and it is a natural and logical step to de-ration them at the sametime. Moreover, the proposals at (ii) may help to counteract a tendency to feedde-rationed wheat products to domestic animals which might otherwise imperil the success of the scheme for restricting flour off take. Finally, the &quot;proposal at(iii) would secure about 265,000 tons of wheat which we need to maintain our floursupplies through the coming crop year, and which would otherwise have to be purchased from overseas, while it would also result in a release of about 350,000tons of coarse grains in a way which would relieve our storage difficulties andwould involve no continuing commitment to an increase in the level of animal feeding which our future supplies might make it impossible to maintain.Ministry of Food,June, 1948.35493c

Home-Gwwn Supplies(a) The latest estimates made by the Agricultural Departments indicate thatthe target of 2 - 5 million acres for 1948 will not be achieved and the 1948 acreagewill not exceed 2,350,000 acres. On the basis of the ten-year average yield and assuming that growers will be permitted to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat for animal feed, it is estimated that millers will receive 61 per cent, of the crop, i.e., 1,347,000 tons during the crop year August, 1948, to July, 1949.(6) If coarse grains are substituted for the proposed 20 per cent, wheatretention, millers&apos; receipts may be increased to 73 per cent, of the crop,i.e., 265,000 tons more than the quantity included above.2. Flour Extraction Rate(a) 85 per cent, until end-December, 1948.(b) For the period January-June, 1949, alternative calculations based on85 per cent, and 80 per cent, extraction respectively are shown in the last twocolumns. If the extraction rate be maintained at 85 per cent, throughout theperiod, the saving in wheat in the first half of 1949 would be 177,000 tons.3. DistributionIt has been assumed that flour deliveries will average 103,000 tons per week.4. Assumed Assured ImportsCanada. Delivery of full contract quantity for 1947-48 crop year by august, 1948; and reasonable rate of delivery of full contract quantity for1948-49.Australia. Completion of wheat shipments against 1947 crop contract by december, 1948; and negotiation of wheat shipments at reduced rate from 1948crop of which it has been assumed provisionally that 100,000 tons will arrive in the United Kingdom by June, 1949. It lias also been assumed that140,000 tons of Australian flour will become available for shipment to theUnited Kingdom up to October, 194.8.Argentina. Balance of purchase from 1947 crop.France. Replacement not later than December, 1948, of 34,000 tons wheat-flour recently diverted to France.5. Possible Additional Imports .        ^Russia. The Ministry&apos;s provisional import programme for 1948-49 included300,000 tons of wheat from this source in January-June, 1949, and a substantialquantity has been proposed in connection with the forthcoming trade talks, butthe uncertainties regarding this source of supply do not justify its inclusion inforecasts of the United Kingdom stock position.Argentina. No provision has been made for further purchases from this source although substantial supplies are believed to be available for export onArgentina&apos;s terms.6. Combined Wheat-Flour Stocks at end-June, 1949The statement shows (a.) that if growers are permitted to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat from the 1948 harvest and the flour extraction rate is reducedto 80 per cent, in January, 1949, combined stocks at end-June, 1949,will equal only 5-1 weeks&apos; supply. To secure the desired 9 weeks&apos;working stocks an additional 502,000 tons of imported wheat would berequired;(6) that if growers are not permitted to retain 20 per cent, of their millable jwheat from the 1948 harvest and the flour extraction rate.is main-tained at 85 per cent., combined stocks at end-June, 1949, should equal[   8-9 weeks&apos; supply (i.c, only slightly below the desired 9 weeks&apos;working stocks) without any additional imported supplies.1*9

If the 240,000metric tons bought for Eire are eventually shipped to United Kingdom, it is estimated at presentthat this quantity would not arrive until May-June 1949.(b) Columns 1 to 8 assume that 750,000 metric tons grain bought from Russia will be shippedin full; column 9 shows total stocks excluding the last 200,000 metric tons.(c) Requirements as current levels. No provision has been made for possible substitution of coarse grains in lieu of 20 per cent, wheat retention.(d) Estimated stocks of maize, barley and oats in columns 5 to 7 are based on usage of oats withoatmeal on points and upon 10 per cent, of feeding-stuffs issued against cereal feed coupons beingbarley/meal.APPENDIX IIIAverage Weekly Deliveries of Flour on United Kingdom AccountJanuary 1945-Moy 1948	(000 tons)			Month	1945	1946	1947	1948January   ...	98-5	98-2	96-4	98-7February ...      ......	100-5	115-2	99-3	101-3March     ...      ......	98-1	103-5	104-8	101-1April       ............	101-4	100-7	100-7	101-2May        .........	96-6	106-2	95-7	100-3June       ............	103-7	97-0	99-3	Average January-June	99-8	103-2	99-3(6)	100-5July      ............	98-0	95-7 (a)	96-6	August    .........	95-1	75-0	97-4	September        .........	102-0	79-9	100-7	October   .........	105-9	94-3	101-4	November............	104-7	95-4	102-1	December         ......	97-2	97-1	98-4	Average July-December	100-6	90-0	99-4	Average for year	100-2	96-6	99-3	(a) Bread rationing introduced with effect from 21st July, 1946.(b) Flour deliveries from mills were restricted during the period of six weeks ended 7th Tune 1947(c) Average January-May only.
