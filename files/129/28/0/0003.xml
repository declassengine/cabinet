DOCUMENT lb THE PROFEHTY&apos; OF HIS BRITAMTIC Mi.JBb!n&apos;s GOlfeSkSSaT)SECRETCjLE^i.k8l.l55 COPY HO.18111 JUNE, .19I48CABINETGRAIN SUPPLIES FOR THE UNITED UliTGDOM, lgLS-kqMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture ana fisheries in his memorandum (CP. (I48) 152)  the Minister- ofFood recommends the early derationing of flour and breadtogether with the removal from points of oatmeal and barleyproducts and an increase in the use of maize for- breakfastfoods.I fully support the proposal to deration flour- andbread and in view of the reasons advanced by the Minister- ofFood,  I do not object to his proposals concerning oat and barley products.      There are,  however,  strong reasons against his recommendation that farmers should be required to surrenderall (instead of 80 per cent.)  of their mi11able wheat and receive coarse grains in substitution.2. On 17th February,  1947,  on 26th April,  igfj7, and again in August,  1947,  I announced, with the agreement of rvcolleagues,  that growers would be allowed  to retain a proportion of millable wheat of the 1948 harvest to feed totheir livestock.      Those announcements were not Qualified inany way,  and farmers sowed their crops and embarked on theirlivestock expansion programme in the expectation that the-would be able,  if they wished,  to retain 20 per cent,  of their,m.i-ll.able wheat.      Many of them would greatly prefer wheat topother-., coarse grains,  especially where the feeding of poultryIs- in question.      It was not until the meeting of the Eocncr.1:-Policy Committee on 5th January, 1948 (S.P.0. [I48) 1st Meeting.Minute l)   that it was decided to warn farmers that if thereshould be an acute shortage of wheat for human eaaasisaption ? itmight be necessary for the Government to ask then to accept an equivalent quantity of coarse grains in substitution.      this/arning I conveyed to farmers in a broadcast talk on3th January,  I9J48.      I should find it difficult to explain to farmers that there is an acute shortage of wheat for human consumption at  the same  time that flour and bread are beingderationed.5. In the Annex -to the Minister of FoodJs memorandum it is recognised (paragraph 6 (g)) that both from the financialpoint of view and from that of economical&quot;use of cereal eappliethe retention by farmers of their 20 per cent, of millable wheat is to be preferred to the surrender of that wheat snd thesubstitution of coarse grains. The Minister of Food reccaaaerdsubstitution solely to ensure that stocks of wheat and flourat the end of June, 1949 shall be not appreciably below g weekssupply.The Minister of Food estimates that if farmers are
allowed to retain 20 per cent, of their millable wheat, but themilling ratio is maintained at 85 per cent, up to the end ofJane, 19it9, wheat stocks at&apos; that date will fall short by276,000 tons of the desirable level of 9 weeks&apos;  supply.      the agriculture Departments&apos;  estimate of wheat deliveries on thebasis of recent crop conditions is, however,  100,000 tons inexcess of that assumed by the Ministry of Food.      This would reduce  the deficit to 176,000 tons.5. The Minister of Food proposes to introduce a&apos;schemeto limit the off take of flour after rationing ends to 100,000tons per week,  but he &quot;is allowing 3,000 tons as a cushion tomeet special cases of hardship or local scarcity.     With alarge potato crop in prospect and with oat end barley productsfreed from points,  there would appear to be a. good chance thatreleases can be limited to the 100,000 tons per week, which represents both the 19U5 and the I9I47/L8 average.&apos;     the cumulative effect of a weekly saving of 3*000 tons would reducethe deficit to about 20,000 tons.6. Negotiations with Russia are due to be resumedshortly and it is proposed  to seels an annual supply of at least,500,000 tons of grain of which a proportion will be wheat.There are also possibilities of securing additional suppliesof wheat from other sources,  e&apos;.g. Canada, Argentine.      should it not be possible to effect the savings described inparagraph 5,  the deficit might still be covered by purchases of F:ussicn or other grain to arrive &apos; before 30th June,  194 9*7. In the unlikely event of all these further suppliesfailing (including &quot;a home crop falling short of presentexpectations)  the stock of wheat and flour at the -end of Junewould I:e 6.7 weeks&apos;  supply.      Although I recognise that  thisevight involve some risk,  it is a risk which  I suggest,  mightwell be  accepted over the short period until new crop Englishwheat becomes available.8. I would urge my colleagues,  therefore,  to agreethee farmers should be allowed to retain 20 per cent, of theirEillcble wheat instead of having to sell that wheat and receivecoarse grains in substitution.      Substitution would involve alarger outlay.,   both in cash and corn,  since many farmers whowould in any circumstances have sold ell their wheat would naturally not hesitate to take subsidised coarse grains if theywere on offer.      It would also mean that a substantial part Ofthe grain would go to fatten cattle.      Our rationing systemprovides no rations for this purpose.      It is very desirablete give additional rations for pigs and poultry,  especially to broaden the basis of rationing.icarse GrainsThe Minister of Food points out that stocks of coarse grains will amount to a million tons at the end of April, I9I49or about 600,000 tons more than the normal carry over.      Ifproposals for the removal of oatmeal from points and for increasing the supply of maize for breakfast foods will absorb100,000 tons,  there will still be c  surplus of about 300,000  .tons in excess of the normal carry over stock.      He advisesthat there should be no additional issues for feedingstuffspurposes owing to the obscurity of supplies in I9I49/5O end asthe accumulated stocks might prove  embarrassing he regards this additional reason for substituting coarse grains for wheat.The dissipation of some 350,000 tons of coarse
grains in this manner would do nothing to assure future-supplies.      Indeed it- would make it more difficult to maintainrations during 19U9/50.      with a surplus in 19/48/9 of some500,000 tons, I would urge that up to 150,000 tons should be released so th-- t- I may widen the conditions of eligibility forrations for pigs and poultry - a step which in itself is as desirable r.s the removal of oatmeal and barley products frompoints and one which I am under constant pressure in the Houseof Commons to take.      This would still leave a balance morethan sufficient to provide for the continuance of this widerbasis for at least another year.      It should be possible tofind    from our own supplies and imports sufficient coarse grains through I9U9/56 to enable the existing ration scales(apart from those to newcomers to which I have referred)  tobe maintained.11. The iigriculture Ministers were agreeable in Januarylast  to comply with on understanding that pending a review ofthe grain position, no additional use of coarse grains shouldbe undertaken for either human,  or industrial purposes, orlivestock feeding.      ciince that time additional quantities heybeen allocated for distilling and for brewing end the pointsrequired for oatmeal end barley products have been reduced.The Minister of-Food&apos;s memorandum now proposes that oatmealand barley products should be taken off points and more maizeshpuld be used for breakfast cereals.     He suggests that no decision should be made as  to further increases in the rateof utilisation of coarse grains for livestock or for humanor industrial purposes.      In view of the quantities of coarse grains that have in fact gone,  or are likely to go, for humanand industrial purposes since the last standstill agreement was made,  I feel strongly that before a new standstill is agreed upon some additional supplies of coarse grains couldlegitimately be earmarked for livestock.T.W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W.
