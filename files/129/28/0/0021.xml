THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1948SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (48) 1711st July, 1948CABINETTHE SITUATION IN MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will wish to have a summary of the present situation in malaya and of the measures which are being taken to meet it.Background to Recent Events2. Malaya is about the size of England without Wales, it has a population(including Singapore) of approximately 5,800,000 people, of whom 2,200,000 areMalays, 2,600,000 Chinese, and 600,000 Indians. It is at present divided into two administrations, namely the Federation of Malaya comprising the wholepeninsula with the exception of Singapore Island, and the Colony of Singapore.The Federation of Malaya (apart from two small areas, Penang and Malacca,which were formerly part of the old Colony of the Straits Settlements) is a federation of nine States, each under a Malay ruler. Executive authority is,however, exercised in most matters not by the State Governments but by theFederation Government under the High Commissioner. Executive authority in singapore is exercised by the Governor.3. The Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South-East Asia,Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, has his headquarters in Singapore. He has taken overthe functions of the former office of Governor-General, Malaya, but has no directexecutive authority. In regard to the British territories within his jurisdictionhe has a general responsibility for co-ordinating policy and administration.4. Since the war the whole of South-East Asia has been a disturbed area.The Japanese occupation which overthrew European and Colonial governments and deeply upset the whole social structure of the occupied countries released asurge of nationalist movements whose force is by no means spent to-day. Further-more, during the time of occupation it was, of course, greatly to our own interests that subversive movements against the Japanese occupation should be encouragedand supplied with arms. It is no wonder that some of the resistance groups which sprang up at that time should as happened also in Europe prove afterliberation an embarrassment to their own Governments.5. Until the outbreak of the present wave of crime Malaya was, in fact,the most peaceful country in South-East Asia and had taken long strides towardsthe re-establishment of stable, prosperous conditions. During 1947 the total valueof the exports of Singapore and the Federation together was  151 million, ofwhich dollar exports accounted for  56 million. It is by far the most importantsource of dollars in the Colonial Empire and it would gravely worsen the wholedollar balance of the sterling area if there were serious interference with Malayanexports.6.   Most of the present trouble in Malaya is due to Chinese groups opposedto the regime of the Chinese National Government.  The trouble is almost certainlyCommunist-instigated, though direct connection between the gangsters and the35566 B
Communist Party cannot always be traced. Secret Societies have always been a prominent feature of Chinese life and were a thorn in the flesh of Governmentin Malaya right through the 19th century. At various times during that centurythey led to outbreaks of armed violence, principally between opposing factionsof Chinese.7. On the reoecupation after the recent war, the Chinese Communistguerillas (the Malayan Peoples&quot; Anti-Japanese Army) were in control of large areas, particularly in Johore and Perak. Their excesses were the cause of bloodySino-Malay clashes in the month following the reoccupation.8. Although the present trouble is largely instigated by the Chinese, a wordmust be said about the other two main communities in Malaya, the Malays andthe Indians. The Malays have been largely preoccupied with the constitutionalnegotiations which led to the modification of the Malayan Union proposals andthe shaping of the present constitution. The Malays are satisfied with this and have so far been very little concerned in the present disturbances. Thereare nevertheless a number of Malays in the Malayan Communist Party andthere are Malay organisations thoroughly permeated with Communist influences.The Indians now provide many of the overt leaders of the Communist party and its satellite organisations, because, being British subjects, they have notbeen treated since the reoccupation as liable to deportation under the law in forcein the Malay States. The Indian leaders are, however, suspected to be mainlymen of straw, and the real organisers are Chinese who have gone underground.Indian community is largely employed as estate labour, and is traditionally passiveand unaggressive, but easy prey for agitators.9. It is also necessary to mention the position of the trade unions in Malaya.The trade unions are still young and poorly organised owing to the fact thatthe majority of workers are unsophisticated and illiterate. Encouragement hasbeen given to the growth of trade unions but unfortunately a large number ofthe existing unions have been infiltrated by what may be called professional&apos;&apos; organisers,&apos;&apos; whose main object is to turn the trade unions into a profitablesource of income and political advantage for themselves. As in some othercountries, these &quot; organisers &quot; are influenced and often controlled by the Com-munist Party. The evils have not stopped short at mere unscrupulous use of union organisation for ends other than the workers&apos; advantage. There has beenphysical intimidation of workers on a large scale. Indian estate labour in some areas has been organised into disciplined bands, sometimes uniformed, armed with lathis and knives. In Singapore an illegal strong arm force (the &quot; Workers&apos;Protection Corps &quot;) has been organised by the Singapore Federation of TradeUnions (a Communist-doniinated body) for purposes of intimidation and extortion.10. We have had several experienced British trade union officials working to guide and help the trade unions and my Labour Adviser has also examined and discussed problems on the spot and suitable action taken. In addition,early this year at the request of the local authorities in Malaya I arranged for mr. S. Awbery, M.P., of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, andMr. F. W. Dalley, of the Eailway Clerks&apos; Union, to visit Singapore and Malayato report on the state of trade unionism. I have just received their report (whichhas not yet been published). It draws attention to the difficulties of developinghealthy trade unionism where the workers have still a low standard of education and have been exploited by unscrupulous so-called organisers; and makesrecommendations which I shall follow up.Present Situation11. In the last few weeks violent crimes have again broken out in theFederation, and labour unrest has become more marked. On 1st June a strongforce of police had to be used to clear 200 Chinese labourers from an estate inJohore where they had taken control. After a police charge seven Chinese were found dead. On 4th June the High Commissioner reported that in recent weeksthere had been twelve serious attacks, all save one attributable to organisedpolitically-inspired violence. In the week ending 12th June there were fivemurders and two attempted murders, all, save one attempted murder, politicalin origin. On 16th June three European planters in Perak were attacked andmurdered in their bungalows by a gang of Chinese armed with Sten guns, whileelsewhere in Perak and on an estate in Johore, where strikes had just ended, aChinese foreman and a Chinese labour contractor were killed.   On 17th June
twelve armed Chinese raided the police station at a small village twelve milesfrom Johore Bahru, and made off with a police rifle, after wounding a passer-by.From the 18th to 29th June inclusive, fifteen murders and fifteen attemptedmurders have been reported to me. It is noteworthy that a number of these attacks conform to a pattern.   They are directed against: (a) The managerial staff, European and Asian, of outlying estates.(b) Leaders of local Kuo Min Tang parties.(c) Persons who have given evidence in intimidation cases.The attacks are carried out by bands of well-armed Chinese, either as ambushesor by sudden descents (sometimes by bicycle) on isolated buildings. There havebeen no large-scale disturbances by labour, and the strike situation which was at no time really serious is now very good : there are now only eight small strikes in progress involving less than 900 workers in all.12. In Singapore there was a wave of unrest among waterfront labour and among workers in rubber milling factories during April. There were a fewincidents, but Government remained in control of the situation, and attempts atone-day general strikes were failures. Since 5th June no cases of violence orintimidation of a political nature have been reported from Singapore. Agitatorshave continued to make inflammatory speeches, and it is reported that in spiteof arrests of ringleaders the &quot; Workers&apos; Protection Corps&apos;&quot; is being expanded.13. Although there is less violence in Singapore, the basic situation in boththe Federation and the Colony is the same. There is no concrete evidence thatthe Malayan Communist Party is directly responsible for the present lawlessnessbut extreme political factions and certain trade unions have been infiltrated bycommunism. The same methods of attack are used intimidation and the wreckingof normal industrial conciliation machinery. Asian born Chinese, who until recently were active in organisations associated with lawlessness.- now seem touse Indian or British nationality for their purpose.14. The Commissioner-General has represented that the first objective ofthe Communist gangs has been and is still by terrorist campaign to produce themaximum industrial unrest and disruption of economic life of the country, witha view amongst other things to destroying the Governmenfs authority. evidence is that the tactics of the Communist gangs are changing from fomenting labour disputes to a policy of picking off the managerial staff of installations and mines.Cash is also being obtained by hold-ups on pay day, particularly in isolated areas.It may be reasonably expected that attempts will be made to sabotage communica-tions, industrial plants and factories, power stations and other vital points. Inaddition to terrorist acts by individuals or small gangs there are many personswho do not engage in violence themselves but who foster and direct these activitiesby various methods. Such persons are distributed throughout the federation and Singapore, and most are overt or covert members of the Malayan CommunistParty and kindred organisations. Further, there is information that mobilisationand training of bands of guerillas in jungle hide-outs is now coming into forceand they will be well organised and armed and their activities will include attacks on villages and small towns to commit murders and robberies and to dislocatetransport systems with ultimate objective of controlling certain areas. As police and military operations succeed in restoring law and order in the more settledareas, such malefactors who escape will tend to join the guerilla bands in the jungle. Guerilla bands may attack Malay kempongs (or homesteads of scatteredbuildings) in particular, partly in order to obtain food, &amp;c, for their maintenance,but also as part of a preconceived plan to stir up gradual Malay enmity suchas occurred during the Japanese occupation and immediately after. This may result in outbursts of violence by Malays against innocent Chinese and adds tothe general state of unrest.Measures to Meet the Situation15. In this situation of violence and murderous outrages in various States,with labour troubles and lawlessness, the following steps have become necessary : (i) Temporary amendment of trade union legislation to limit trade unionofficers to persons associated with the trade or industry concerned andto confine federations of trade unions to bona fide industrial organisa-tions in the particular trades or callings.35566 b 2
(ii) A state of emergency was proclaimed on 16th. June in certain areas ofPerak and Johore, and extended on 17th June to the whole of theState of Perak and on 18th June to. the remainder of the Federation.Emergency Regulations have been made which include the reimpositionof the death penalty for the offence of carrying arms, and the authori-ties have been empowered to detain any person without trial, to searchpersons and buildings without warrant and to occupy properties.Where local conditions require, the authorities have power to impose a curfew and to control the movement of persons and vehicles.(iii) The use of the powers of deportation conferred by existing legislation in Malaya was, prior to the present disturbances, confined by mydirection to aliens. In response to strong representations from theauthorities in Malaya that British subjects (mainly Indians) were in-consequence being used as stooges by organisers of seditious movementsI have agreed to deportation powers being exercised throughout theFederation against any person who is not identified with the country as a Federal citizen.(iv) The emergency legislation referred to. at (ii) above will, upon thedeclaration of a stage of emergency, enable the High commissioner to make regulations providing inter alia for the detention of any person for a period not in excess of two years. I have given directions thatthese powers of detention are only to be exercised against persons whoare implicated in acts of violence or in organising or inciting persons to take part in strikes, disturbances or demonstrations in which violenceor threat of violence is used. I have also given directions that papersrelating to each case in which detention is recommended must be reviewed by a Supreme Court Judge. The above powers of detentionwill enable action to be taken against Federal citizens who will, asindicated in (iii) above, not be regarded as liable to deportation,(v) Very active measures are being taken to strengthen the police in boththe Federation and Singapore. These measures include the organisa-tion of a force of special constabulary; the increase of the regular police force by further recruitment and training of local personnel;the formation of a frontier force or gendarmerie to patrol the northern frontier where undesirable persons and arms can enter Malaya; the diversion of civil officers from ordinary duties to assist in the adminis-trative work of the police, and in organising and directing the special constabulary; special measures to expedite the supply of equipmenton existing orders, and to obtain new equipment, such as scout cars,armoured cars, mobile wireless sets, and additional supplies of armsand ammunition.(vi) In addition to the other measures for strengthening the police force, Ihave sent out to Malaya Mr. W. N. Gray, late Inspector-General ofthe Palestine Police, who has special experience in combatingterrorism. His mission will be to discuss all measures likely to increasethe efficiency of existing police action against terrorism, including thepossibility of strengthening the police with recruits from the PalestinePolice. I am expecting to get, within the next few days, estimatesfrom Malaya of the number of men from the Palestine Police who could usefully be employed. In any case I have been asked to recruit 60additional assistant superintendents of police.(vii) The Army and R.A.F. are giving the fullest support to the Police and close co-operation between the military and the civil authorities isprovided by the British Defence Co-ordination Committee, Far East,over which the Commissioner-General presides, and the local DefenceCommittees in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya,(viii) In the last few days the Commissioner-General, Mr. Malcolm Macdonald, has represented to me that the High Commissioner forthe Federation of Malaya, Sir Edward Gent, has lost the confidence of the public in the Federation and the heads of other Services. he reported that in consequence it was essential, in his view, to recallSir Edward Gent to England at once, and that he should not returnto Malaya. His recommendation was made in such terms that I hadno alternative but to agree to it at once, and Sir Edward Gent is nowflying home. Tie is due in England on 3rd July. The Chief Secretaryof the Federation of Malaya, Sir Alexander Newboult, is now acting as High Commissioner pending another appointment.
Plan of Future Operations16. The Commissioner-General has sent me the following summary of theoperations proposed as a result of inter-Service discussions in Malaya. Opera-tions are planned in two phases : 17. In phase 1 the objective is to restore law and order in settled areas ofthe territory and to maintain the economic life of the country and restore morale.This will be carried out through two distinct types of operations : (a) by offensive operations to round up gangsters, including the establishment of road blocks and traffic control, periodical sweeps where murders or robberies have been committed,and widespread searches for arms and other incriminating evidence; (&amp;) protectivemeasures, through provision of armed guards for police stations, power stations,prisons, warehouses, factories, docks and other vital points. In order to main-tain the economic life of the country and restore confidence in outlying districtsit is also necessary to provide static guards for the larger rubber estates, mines,transport system and Malay villages.18. Phase 2 will comprise the operations necessary to liquidate the guerillabands whose headquarters are in the jungle. This will involve the destruction oftheir camps, cutting off of food supplies, and uncovering dumps of arms andequipment. These operations will be primarily of a military nature in which,however, the police will participate. The operations may take a considerable time owing to the nature of the country involved. Phase 2 cannot be extensivelyundertaken until sufficient success has been achieved in phase 1.19. The Civil and Service authorities in Malaya are, of course, in consulta-tion as to whether the existing military forces in Malaya are adequate to meet allforeseeable calls upon them arising from the present disturbances.A.
