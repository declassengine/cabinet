COPY NO.  3l50th June, 1948.CABI1ETWAR GRI2SES:    GaSB OF GERL-kN GENERALS INIBlRrrlSE CUSTODYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarI cannot agree that tfcie Attorney-General1smemorandum (CP. (48)159) of 22nd June on this subjectcommenting on mine of 17th June is a fair statement.In particular the suggestion that there has beeninexcusable delay of two years in bringing these Generalsto trial, and that this has been due to reluctance on thepart of British officers to see them tried, is quiteunjustified.So far as the vfar Office is concerned the questiondid not become a practical one until September last whenthe Attorney-General sent my;predecessor the letter he hadreceived from General Telford Taylor.My predecessor, in writing to the Foreign secretary on 3rd October pointed out the difficulties of staging asatisfactory trial of this kind without a great deal of research, examination of documents and interrogations, and suggested that it was-more suitable for trial under UnitedStates procedure than by a military court.I have no knowledge of the Commander-in-chief,Germany, saying that he did, not like the idea of thesemen being tried.     mas Foreign Secretary wrote to theLord Chancellor on 2nd December saying that General Robertsonin Berlin had been in touch with General Clay, but that thelatter was must reluctant to accept any additionaldefendants.The Lord Chancellor, in his opinion dated 22ndDecember, wrote that the documents afforded evidence of a prima facie case, but addeduTfcte question of the prosecution of Strauss,even-though there Is such evidence against him,is different because he was in a comparativelysubordinate position.     Nor does it appear to methat the weight of evidence against Strauss is so strong as that against the others.     We have onlyseen some of the documents and these are in Germanand have not been translated./Secondly
Secondly, it may not be easy to bring homeoffending documents to the accused, and by thatI mean we may not be able to get actual signatures.Thirdly, it may be difficult to prove that action was taken - i.e. that people were shot uponthe strength of the offending orders.11The Foreign Secretary agreed that before any of the generals could be brought to trial we must be sure that theactual evidence would bear out the summary.I think the above sufficiently disposes of thesuggestion that the Generals could and should have beenbrought to trial two years ago.     The Nuremberg Judgementitself was not delivered until October, 1946.The Foreign Secretary has recently pressed thatall War trials should be brought to an end, and the pastburied as far as possible, by 1st September next, eventhough this may mean leaving untried men guilty of_atrociouscrimes against our own people, such as the Stalag Luft IIImurders, who nay come into our hands after that date.     Isit quite consistent&apos;with this to embark now on-the trialsof these Generals on charges, in which our own direct interest is very small, when, with the best of efforts, thesecannot be started,much less completed, for many months?E.S.The War Office.50 June, 1948.
