THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1948SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (48) 18819th July, 1948CABINETANTI-INFLATIONARY MEASURES IN THE COLONIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesWITH reference to the Cabinefs discussion on 13th July (CM. (48)50th Conclusions, Minute 2) I am circulating, for the information of mycolleagues, the following notes on anti-inflationary measures in the Colonies.I. introduction. The Colonies have little share in the primary cause of inflation. Everypenny of money issued in the Colonies is the result of a transfer from sterling in London. If the monetary circulation in a Colony goes up, it is because partof the total of sterling available in London has been converted into cash in WestAfrica, Malaya (or wherever it may be, instead of being held in cash or in a bank deposit in the United Kingdom.2. Once an increased amount of money has been created, various thingscan be done to counteract or remedy its effects. These are divisible into truecounter-measures, which aim at the genuine removal of some of the purchasingpower which is pressing on the market, and measures which are primarilydesigned to deal with symptoms without really reducing the pressure of purchasingpower. In the first category are measures for the withholding of some part of current money incomes, e.g., price stabilisation schemes; personal savings and investment in long-term Government securities; and budgetary policies aiming at the creation of true budget surpluses by collecting more in revenue than theState is currently paying out in expenditure. The measures which deal with thesymptoms rather than the underlying causes are measures of price control andof subsidisation of the cost of living. These are not necessarily useless, but itis important to realise the difference and also that their effective use tends tocreate a rather novel kind of monetary phenomenon which has come to be knownas suppressed- inflation, which in turn creates new problems of its own.II. General Measures against Inflation in the Colonies3. Colonial Governments have been advised where appropriate to use all or any of the measures referred to above.   In particular : (i) Schemes, of which particulars are given in Section III below, havebeen in operation in some cases for many years past to withhold from colonial producers part of the exceptional rises in the price of their products.(ii) Colonial  Governments have been repeatedly exhorted  to  increaserevenues and build up revenue surpluses.(iii) A great deal of effort has been devoted to the encouragement of personalsaving by Colonial residents, but the results have been disappointing.This is almost certainly due to the lack of attraction which current rates of interest on Government securities hold for the averageinhabitant in the Colonies.(iv) All Colonial Governments have established systems of price control, but their effectiveness is much less than in this country owing to the moreprimitive character of the communities and the administrations. TheReport of the Gold Coast Commission reluctantly recognises the impossibility of any really tight price control in African conditions.35641
Price control has been used rather to prevent sudden and sharpincreases than to hold down the level of prices permanently.(v) Subsidisation of the cost of living, adjusted to local circumstances, hasbeen used by a large number of of Colonies. It nas been financedpartly from local resources and partly by grants from His Majesty sGovernment; and the basic object has been to prevent the beginningof an inflationary spiral by rises in wages to keep pace with the costof living. The policy is to keep subsidisation within reasonable limits and to remove it &quot;gradually.III. Marketing Schemes for Colonial Produce4. Provision has been made in a number of eases for bulk marketing schemes under which the price paid out to producers has been less, in some cases very much less, than the current prices obtained on resale of the produce, the balance being put aside for price stabilisation or developmental purposes. Such schemes com-menced for West African cocoa very early in the war and are to-day in operation for cocoa, palm oil, palm kernals and groundnuts in West Africa, cotton in uganda, and sugar in the West Indies, Mauritius and Fiji. They have alwaysbeen regarded as most appropriate for products produced mainly^ by peasantgrowers. It is less necessary to arrange for such (^mpuisory withholding of income in the case of plantation and mining industries since the amount of pur-chasing power put into circulation by wage payments is not directly related tocurret prices and the firms concerned are themselves likely to put aside to reservea large part of any exceptional increases of prices.IV. -Taxation Policy5. Colonial Governments have several times been advised to considerincreases of import duty as a means of mopping up purchasing power, althoughthe use made of this particular method has been limited. Insofar as it has been used, there has been no special discrimination between European and non-European consumption; but, where particular kinds of goods are mainly consumedby one class of the community or the other, regard has been given to the availablepurchasing power of the class in question in fixing import tariffs.6. The suggestion that increased import tariffs might operate in restricting the amount of goods available for purchase reflects a conflict of thought between (a) the desirability of putting up prices of consumer goods in order to mopup purchasing power (which underlies the purchase tax policy inthe United Kingdom); and(b) the desirability of having as many goods as possible available for purchase.It is one of the most difficult problems of Colonial economic administration tosteer a middle course between these objectives, and it is not a matter on which any general principle can be laid down. There is no doubt a need in manyColonies to put many goods on sale at low prices both to counter inflation and toact as an incentive to production. Decisions must depend on judgment of localpsychology and the relative urgency of the need for increased production.V. Supply of Consumer Goods6. The problem of making more goods available, which is the fundamentalremedy for excess purchasing power, does not, however, primarily turn on taxationpolicy. Nor are import controls to-day an important difficulty.&quot; Goods from theUnited Kingdom or other Colonies (and to a large extend from the sterlingDominions) are imported quite freely, except for a short and diminishing list ofthings which are either under allocation or are reserved bv the United Kino-domfor sale in hard-currency markets. It is indeed the policy of Colonial governments to secure the maximum fiW into their territories of consumer goods and particu-larly incentive goods. It is the continuous effort of the Colonial Office and theColonial authorities to achieve this end; but in present conditions the fact is thatthere are just not enough goods to go round in the world as a whole and our efforts can often do no more than relieve in small measure the local inflationarysituation at the cost of intensifying inflationary pressure elsewhere.A.
