this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1948The circulation of this paper:has been strictly limited. It is issued; for the personal5use,of cp. (48) 15722nd June, 1948CABINETIRON AND STEEL bill memorandum by Minister of supply at their meeting on 14th June (CM. (48) 39th Conclusions Minute 5 (4))the Cabinet asked me to submit a paper dealing with the powers of the Corpora-tion and, in particular, with the suggestion that, with a view to avoiding thedifficulties of defining in the Bill the powers it should possess, the corporation should be constituted as a holding company. That is to say, the whole of theexecutive activities of the State-owned industry would be carried out by sub-sidiary companies in which the Corporation would be the sole shareholder, and,as such, would exercise general financial and policy control.2.: Such a proposal is attractive, but after consideration my conclusion isthat its advantages are outweighed by the disadvantages, and that it would therefore be undesirable to adopt it.3.   The advantages are : (a) It would not be necessary to provide specifically in the Bill for the extensivemanufacturing and operating powers of the Corporation as proposedin either of the alternatives of Clause 2 of the Draft Bill attachedto CP. (48) 123. Consequently, there will be less scope for the Oppo-sition to seek amendment of Clause 2, which in its present form will undoubtedly give rise to much controversy.(b) It would be organisationally simpler and better if the Corporation^activities were confined to that of a holding company and in no...... circumstances entered, itself, into the field of industry and commerce.4.   The disadvantages of the suggestion, as I see them, are : (a) The manufacturing and operating powers of the new State industry would, in effect, be just the same as proposed in the Bill. It is truethat the powers would always have to be carried out by the constituentcompanies, but the Corporation, as sole shareholder, would be perfectlyfree to rearrange the company structures and activities by way of transfer of plants, winding-up of companies, and amalgamations. Itwould also be able to establish new companies, and could, in fact,bring sections of the industry under its direct executive control either by making members and officers of the Corporation the d andexecutives of transferred companies or of newly established companies.(b) The prospect of diminishing the opposition to Clause 2 is illusory.The Opposition would quickly appreciate that the State-ownedindustry would still have extremely wide manufacturing powers,even though they were at one remove from the Corporation, andtheir efforts to restrict the powers would not be abated.3TOP SECRET V      t ,      &quot; - y&apos; Copy No.   2935513
2(e) My present idea is that the Corporation may, if it so chooses, be free to undertake certain executive functions, such as the centralised pur-chase of materials (e.g., imported iron-ore and semi-finished steel),the distribution of any subsidies which may be involved, the super-vision of central research and, possibly, some degree of centralisedselling. With a holding company arrangement the corporation would have to get one or more subsidiary companies to carry out theseexecutive activities, and it might well be unsatisfactory if (these responsibilities, which would have considerable influence on thegeneral control of the industry, had to be discharged on a second-hand basis. The directors of the subsidiary company concerned would naturally feel that they had some weight, and would tend to make itfelt; so that any influence the Government wished to bring to bearon the industry would not necessarily be effective as a result of discus-sions with the Corporation. They, in turn, would have to influence the subsidiary company. Admittedly, this position would normallyapply, under the arrangement proposed in the Bill, to manufacturingactivities, but under Clause 2 the Corporation could take direct control if circumstances should ever warrant this course.(d) A holding company arrangement might appear to many of our supportersto smack too much of City financial methods and the continuance, ineffect, of the old regime.(e) In any event, we should have to write certain powers for the Corporationinto the Bill. I am assuming that the proposal envisages the statu-tory creation of the Corporation as a holding company, and not theformation of a company by the normal methods with the drawing upof a memorandum of association defining its objects and powers. Weshould, therefore, have anyhow to write into the Bill certain powersto enable the Corporation to carry on such routine activities asrunning an office organisation, and acquiring accommodation, cars,equipment, stationery, &amp;c.5. I hold strongly that it would be wrong to restrict the Corporation byany unnecessary statutory limitations. It may be that it will not desire to under-take any direct operations itself, but that is no reason for barring it from doing so. The structure which the Bill establishes should be as flexible as possible. Itwould, therefore, I suggest be a mistake to modify the Bill by limiting theCorporation to holding company activities in order to minimise possible parlia-mentary difficulties in securing the statutory definition of the wide powersproposed in Clause 2 of the Bill. It is in fact doubtful, as I suggest in para-graph 4 (b) above, whether opposition to the powers involved would be sensiblyabated by this means. I accordingly recommend that the Bill should be intro-duced with Clause 2 in the form of the first alternative which gives the Corpora-tion the sum of the existing powers in the memoranda of companies and allowseach company to rest on its own memorandum, and that I should be authorisedto make a concession in Committee, if necessary, by substituting the second alternative which restricts the Corporation to the sum of the activities actuallyperformed at the date of transfer by the companies and limits each company toactivities which it can undertake under its memorandum and which it or someother company was actually performing..
