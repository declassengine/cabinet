ANNEX AMemorandum to O.E.E.C. covering United Kingdom Programme,1st July, 1948, to 30th June, 19491 This memorandum is an explanation of the Budget programme and theRequirements programme for the year 1948-49 submitted by the ffmtei Kiggotj(It covers the points (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) in paragraph 11 of C. (48) 4b(Revise).) .2 The level of economic activity in the United Kingdom is now higherthan ever before; both manufacturing and agricultural production are well abovethe best pre-war years; exports are running far above 1938 in volume; unemploy-ment is negligible.3 The reasons for our balance of payments difficulties, which force us toask for economic assistance, are well-known. The loss of foreign income fromshipping and overseas investments, the steep rise in import prices, the failureof production to recover in Europe and Asia, the radical changes in the pattern of world trade resulting from the war, the inconvertibility of currencies; anyone of these would have presented us with grave problems to solve, and the combination of them puts us in a most difficult position. The measure of these difficulties is the drain on our reserves of $4 billions in .1947, and at the rate of$2 billions a year in the first half of 1948.Our Principles of Recovery4. Recovery for us means the recovery of our balance of payments at areasonable consumption level and the restoration of our external financial strength.This is the central objective of all our economic policies. We regard this asfundamental, not only for ourselves, but for our associates in the sterling area,for the other participating countries, and indeed for all countries which depend upon world trade and which conduct much of their business in sterling.5. The Government has laid down two principles which govern our policyin the E.R.P. period, and which determine these and other programmes whichwe submit to O.E.E.C.: (i) We intend to maintain our reserves throughout the period at their ievelat the beginning of the period, i.e., limiting our dollar outgoings toour dollar income plus external aid.(ii) Our programmes will concentrate upon the achievement of viability.6. If these principles cannot be carried out, E.R.P. cannot bring about ourrecovery.Steps Towards Recovery in 1948-497. Our economic activity is directed as far as possible in accordance withthese principles. There is no simple way for a country which depends heavilyupon international trade to proceed towards viability, but there are three mainlines along which we are moving: (i) Expansion of exports, especially to the dollar area.(ii) Development of overseas supplies of primary products, in countriesreadily accessible to British exports.(iii) Growth of import-saving production, i.e., the full use of our ownindigenous resources; re-equipment of industry and public utilitiesfor increased efficiency.The economic programme which we are now submitting for 1948-49 will show considerable progress in all these directions.8. Ecoports.-The overall export level for 1948-49 is programmed at135 per cent, of 1938 volume, compared with 108 per cent, in 1947, involving anincreased flow to all parts of the world. In particular, exports to the western hemisphere are estimated, by value, at 55 per cent, above 1938.9 Overseas DevelopmentJ.-Work is proceeding on a number of specificprojects in the overseas dependent territories (e.g., the East African ground-nutsscheme). These specific projects tend to attract more attention, but large?fi?alresults are of course secured by the normal process of development of facilitiesalready in existence; the process of rehabilitation and re-equipment, halted for
six years by the war and delayed since for lack of supplies, will go a stage further in 1948-49.10. Production of primary products in other parts of the Commonwealthis also expanding and should yield increased supplies for ourselves and the other participating countries. A substantial part of our exports to the sterling area infact consists of equipment for the development of increased production.11. We hope that the recovery of the other participating countries willyield larger supplies of primary products in 1948-49; we cannot hope forsignificant results in 1948-49 from new projects which may be developed as aresult of O.E.E.C. co-operation, but we have already suggested lines along whichthe first steps might be taken.12. Use of United Kingdom Resources.- The main lines along which we are working are : (i) Agriculture. The long-term development plan, designed to increase production by 1952 to 150 per cent, of pre-war, is now getting underway. The main element in it is the livestock programme, designedin the first instance to make good the losses sustained in the war.To provide the feeding-stuffs for this programme an intensive grass-land improvement campaign is being pursued and other domestic re-sources are being developed but the rate of livestock recovery dependsvery largely upon the supply of imported feeding-stuffs. If these suppliescome up to expectations it is hoped to make considerable progress with the whole development programme in 1948-49.(ii) Coal. About  25 millions will be invested in the modernisation of thecoal industry in. 1948-49. About one-fifth of this will be used toreplace existing installations with completely up-to-date equipment;another fifth in coal preparation plant; a further fifth in large schemesfor the redevelopment of existing pits and the sinking of new ones;another fifth in coal preparation plant; and the remainder on projects to get a rapid increase of output or reduction of costs by mechanisa-tion underground, reorganisation of haulage and the development ofdrift mining. The programme is in fact a combination of short-term and long-term investments.(iii) Electricity. Some  150 millions will be invested in electricity supply;this is the 1948-49 work to be done on this development to make good the absence of development during the war, and to provide our economywith all the power facilities it needs.(iv) Oil. A substantial programme of refinery construction in UnitedKingdom, both by British-controlled and American-controlled com-panies, is under way; these new projects will not reach the productionstage in 1948-49. A considerable expansion of crude oil production by British-controlled companies overseas is in progress,(v) Steel. 1949 is the peak year in the steel industry&apos;s development pro-gramme and  40 millions of work will be done in the year 1948-49.The largest scheme is the South Wales plan for sheet and tinplateproduction, with integrated steelworks to supply hot strip; this was started in 1947 and will not be finished until 1952. There are other major modernisation projects, including increase of crude steel andtube production, most of which will not be finished for some years ahead, though some benefits will be received in the meantime; someof the smaller elements in the programme will be completed in thecourse of the year.(vi) Chemicals. Major expansion of facilities are taking place, includingchemicals based upon oil cracking, dyestuffs, carbon black, syntheticfibres, plastic materials and fertilisers. In all these fields we are trying to meet not only our own essential requirements but also toprovide for export. Many of these projects will not be completedfor some vears.(vii) Light industry. In the cotton, rayon, pottery and hosiery industries,a programme for modernisation of equipment and improvement of factory conditions is being pressed forward with the object of attracting more labour to these industries, raising the output per headand lowering costs. These industries are particularly important forthe export trade. .(viii) Transport. A large-scale programme of reconstruction of the inland transport system and rehabilitation of the merchant marine.
13 These are the lines along which we see the way out of our difficultiesVery little result will flow from this work in the year 1948^ 9, much ot it willnot bear fruit until 1952 or later.14 This work of building up exports, developing overseas sources of supply,setting up new production to replace imports and modernising industry cannotgo on unless we can get food and raw material imports. The main function otE R P in the import programme which we submit, is to provide the food and rawmaterials for the general life of the country, and thus enable this work to be done.15. It is impossible specifically to relate the imports of food, raw materials and petroleum to the particular plans which are aimed at securing our viability.Without these imports, none of these plans could be implemented. The role ofE.R.P. is to provide a general support for our economy, the existence of whichsupport permits us to carry out these development programmes. But there is no direct and tangible link between the specific E.R.P. supplies and the individualdevelopment programmes. Without E.R.P. aid, however, it would be necessaryto export more capital goods in order to pay for the food and raw materials which we need instead of using them for our own re-equipment.16. So far as it can, the United Kingdom is producing the equipment required for its development programmes; the payments for import of capital equipment in our E.R.P. programmes are for items that are essential and arenot made in United Kingdom or available quickly enough in this country. they include spare parts to keep machinery already here in operation: replacementsfor worn out-machines; complete new plants and individual machines; commonservice items such as ball- bearings, precision chain, electric motors, &amp;c.; produc-tion parts for incorporation in machines made in this country for home and export,e.g., agricultural tractors, typewriters, &amp;c. It is difficult to assess quantitativelythe effect on our recovery programme of these imports which are mainly ordered by. individual manufacturers; but the various progammes described in para-graphs 12 and 13 above would be seriously delayed if the machinery imports onwhich they depend were not forthcoming.The &quot; Budget &quot; Programme17. In the light of the economic policy outlined above, we have prepared the&quot; Budget &quot; programme. This is based upon the amount of E.R.P. aid shown in theBrown Book for the fifteen months 1st April, 1948, to 30th June, 1949 \i.e. -$1,671millions) minus the aid ($400 millions) allocated to us by E.C.A. for the period 1stApril, 1948, to 30th June, 1948. We thus provide an EJI.P. programme of 81,271millions. Of the aid allocated for the second calendar quarter, -$300 millions wason grant and $100 millions on loan. For the purpose of setting up this programme,we have assumed that when the process of authorisation and reimbursement is complete, this $400 millions will all have been used to finance supplies bought inthe second calendar quarter.18. Following the principle in paragraph 5(i) above, we have limited our dollar import programme to the point at which it is covered bv our dollar incomeplus the $1,271 millions E.R.P. aid. In doing this, we have made some allowance for possible drawing on our outstanding credit from Canada. At present, theCanadian Government is unable to allow us to draw upon the credit, but has expressed the hope that if the harvest is favourable, and according to thedevelopment of Canada&apos;s United States dollar position, we mav be able to resumedrawings later in the year.19. The economic effect of this programme is to permit us. broadlv speaksto continue our existing consumption and production. It provides no&quot; margin to free resources for additional development work or to increase incentives for theworking population; it enables us to remain where we are continuing thedevelopment programmes outlined above, but at a much slower tempo than wouldbe possible with more aid. c20. Food.-The programme provides broadly for continuation of presentconsumption levels :  ^coculFlour : supplies at 103,000 tons a week, (i.e., 295 grams per head per davfor the population as a whole). ^ p    a^Meat : continuation of Is. ration (equivalent to 454 grams).
Bacon : continuation of 2 oz. ration, but with possible increase to 3 oz. for ashort period next spring.Sugar : continuation of 8 oz. ration.Fats : continuation of 8 oz. ration of margarine, butter and cooking fat.Cheese : continuation of 1^ oz. ration.Eggs : increase from 93 eggs per head in 1947-48 to an average of 97 eggsper head.We are placing no demands for major foods in short supply on United States.21. Feeding Stuffs. We have not included any requirements of coarse grains from dollar sources because we hope to secure supplies from other sourceswhich will increase consumption of coarse grains from 6 million tons in 1947-48to 8^ million tons. If these efforts are successful we shall be able to broaden thepresent rationing scheme (which provides supplies for pigs and poultry only to producers established before the war) and to provide a bonus on performance andan increase in the basic rations (at present based on one-fifth of pre-war numbersof pigs and poultry). If these improvements can be made the expansion inlivestock numbers which has taken place in the past year can be continued.22. Raw Materials. On this programme, supplies will be sufficient tomaintain distribution to industry at about the present absorption rate, which isenough to keep industry going on an &quot; austerity &apos;&apos; basis for the home market and full supplies for exports. We have programmed steel supplies from the UnitedStates on the assumption that availability will not improve; if increased suppliesof semis could be made available, we should take much more, with great positivebenefit to our engineering industry, and particularly to the development programmes outlined above; we attach high priority to steel semis in laying out our dollar import programme. In other raw materials, we are prevented by thefinancial limit imposed by the Budget programme from buying all that we need,and in particular from buying enough to get a smooth industrial flow.23. Machinery. The programme is on the basis of present import licensingpolicy, by which purchase of an American machine is permitted if it is genuinelyneeded and a suitable British machine is not available quickly enough.24. Other Manufacturers. Mainly semi-manufactures for industrial use.Imports of manufactured consumer goods from dollar sources are negligible (e.g.,books, newspapers, &amp;c.) and include token imports, designed to maintain pre-warcontacts between suppliers and markets.25. Tobacco. Minimum supplies of North American tobacco, enough tomaintain consumption and leave a minimum stock at the end of the year.26. Petroleum. Enough supplies are provided to maintain industrial andindustrial transport use, with a continuation of the present standard ration to private motorists, sufficient for travelling ninety miles a month. Coal/oilconversion has been stopped and consumption of motor spirit will be about 5 percent, below the 1947 level. -27. Petroleum Equipment. Equipment is included for the refinery projects in the United Kingdom and Holland, and for the purchase of essential drillingand production equipment to increase crude oil availability in 1948-49. material required for the rehabilitation and expansion of refineries in N.E.I., Middle East,Curacao and Venezuela has also been included. The programme makes provisionfor the needs of subsidiaries of United States companies in the United Kingdomarid dependent overseas territories as well as for British companies.28. The general effect of the Budget programme would therefore be as setout in paragraph 19 above it would permit us, broadly speaking, to continue our existing consumption and production. If the amount of aid available were lessthan the Budget programme, we should be confronted with a very difficultdilemma. There would be three possibilities open to us, in order to save or earnmore dollars : (i) Further reduction in consumption of food, &amp;c, in the United Kingdom,(ii) Reduction of raw material imports, and consequently either a fall in exports (which would necessitate further import cuts) or a further delay or postponement in completing the development programmes, ora reduction in the consumption of manufactured goods.
(iii) Action to rednce our dollar drain, some of which might have the effectof making more difficult the recovery of other countries (e.g., requiringdollars in payment for oil bought from dollar sources for delivery to other countries).Adoption of these policies would clearly make more difficult our own recovery,and would be bound to have repercussions upon the other participating countries and, indeed, upon the world economy at large. But such action would be inevitableif we did not have at least as much aid as is provided in the Budget programme.The &quot; Requirements &quot; Programme29. In framing our &apos;&apos; requirements &apos;&apos; programme, our main difficulty islack of availability of the critical supplies, and particularly of steel and other materials needed for the engineering industry. Our requirements programmeincludes steel imports from United States only on the &quot; Brown Book &quot; basis; if more could be made available, we could press much faster ahead. Our own develop-ment programmes in the United Kingdom, the developments in the dependent territories, and the petroleum projects are all slowed down for lack of steel.30. The general purpose of the &quot; requirements &quot; programme is to further the recovery process outlined above, by all possible means, consistent with the availability of supplies. &quot;We must emphasise the limitation placed upon us by thesupply availability; the additional tranche, over and above the &quot; Budget&quot;programme consists of supplies which we believe to be available and not thosewhich would help us most.  The additions are : $ millionsTood       .........Feeding-stuffsRaw materials  ...MachineryTobacco  ...Shipping (to carry these)12370132102540400This is, of course, all assumed to be financed by E.R.P., making a total E.R.P.programme of 1,670 millions.31. Food. The very modest additional programme has been designed withthe need in mind for maximum stimulus to industrial production. Present food supplies are perhaps sufficient to make possible a diet that is technically adeqate.But it is also dreary, and the dreariness reduces the effectiveness. More sugar istherefore included in the programme in order to improve the palatability of the diet and this ensures that full benefit is derived from it. The sugar ration is raised by 2 oz. to 10 oz. with a corresponding increase in the release for manu-factures. The programme provides also for additional cheese supplies so as tosafeguard the special ration allowance made to agricultural and other heavyworkers. The other small increase in canned fish and dried and canned milkwould go some way to restoring the levels of distribution which were ruling beforethe cuts were made in 1947.32. Feeding-stuffs.-An additional 780,000 tons of coarse grains from united States and Canada. This, in addition to the supplies in the Budgetprogramme which assumes substantial supplies from non-dollar sourceswould permit a wider range of improvements, and the rate of livestockexpansion could be accelerated to the full extent necessary to achieve the targetproduction of pig meat, eggs and milk under the long-term development plan.33. Raw Materials. Additional supplies of steel up to Brown Book. Thesupplies of non-ferrous metals would be increased to a point at which they couldbe issued without restriction; additional timber is provided to enable housing toproceed faster to help the manning of industries which it is required to expand(the lack of houses is the worst difficulty in recruiting miners and agricultural workers). Newsprint is provided for a 6-page newspaper, instead of the present4-page paper.   Some improvement in stocks of cotton would be possible.34. Machinery. The additional $10 million for machinery consists of essential items such as textile machinery, of which the United Kingdom urgentlyneeds more if supplies can be made available.
35. Tobacco. An increase in stocks is very necessary; the stock levels onthe &quot; Budget&quot; programme are too low for efficient operation in this industry.36. Taken as a whole the requirement programme would enable us to movefaster on the critical agricultural and engineering fronts, and would have astimulating effect upon activity all round.I ntra-European Payments37. We are requested to furnish a memorandum on the changes which weshould make in the programmes if the most serious intra-European payments difficulties were to disappear. In our dollar import &quot; Budget&quot; programme thereare no items which could be reduced if supplies, known to be physically availablein other participating countries, could be obtained without payment difficulty.If there were no gold payment difficulty, and if the terms of sale were acceptable andif we could get the steel in the form we want, we could take substantial additional quantitites of Belgian steel. But we should still need as much as we could get from the United States. On the &quot; Budget &quot; programme, we should not reduce ourcopper imports from the dollar area if we got more from the Belgian Congo, for we are restricting consumption of copper and thus the activity of the engineering industry.Conclusion38. The programmes which we are submitting can be summed up in thefollowing terms: (i) The &quot; Budget &quot; programme is just enough to permit us to continue our existing production and consumption; it enables us to proceed withour development programmes, but at a much slower tempo than wouldbe possible with more aid.(ii) The  &quot;Requirements&quot;  programme is seriously limited by lack ofavailability, particularly of steel. The additional aid which it wouldprovide would enable us to step up production, particularly in the fields of special importance for our long-term recovery.(iii) If aid is less than the &apos;&apos; Budget&apos;&apos; programme, we have to choose betweencutting our consumption (which would almost certainly damage pro-duction), cutting the raw material supply to industry (with highlydamaging effects upon production), or action to reduce our owndollar drain which would make more difficult the recovery of othercountries; the policy adopted would no doubt embrace all three ofthese lines of action.
