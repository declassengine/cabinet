prime iiaisierDock strike the Emergencies Committee,  of which I am Chairman,met last- evening.     Ws considered a report by the (Official)Co-ordinating Committee which had met earlier in the day.I informed my colleagues that I proposed to report our conclusions to you - I had purposely refrained from worryingyou &quot;with details of our proceedings before your broadcast - andI understand a meeting of the Cabinet has been summoned thismorning, for this purpose.     Briefly they were as follows:-Draft Emergency Regulations - To deal with the state ofemergency recognised by the Proclamation which you havezamotmz-sQ. additional executive powers are required.     A code of Regulations tc this end was agreed by the emergencies committee.      Its heads are -Prohibition of trespassing and loiteringProhibition of endangering or obstructingmembers of H.M. Forces, Police,  etc.Prohibition of dissuading members of H.M.Forces, Police,  etc. from dutyEmployment of police forces outside own areaBilletting of H.M. ForcesControl of traffic at portsPower to Postmaster-General to restrict postal and telegraphic servicesPower to stop end search vehiclesPower to arrest without warrantAdministrative provisions and definitions.It is hoped to circulate for the Cabinet meeting a print-prepared by Parliamentary Counsel.On the understanding that a Privy Council will considerthe Regulations at 6 p.m. to-day, we agreed that the regulations should be published tomorrow and come into force on Thursday,1st July.Ex-rclss of recuisitlonins powers - It will be politic if anyrequisitioning is no one, not by the Service Departments direct,but by the Ministries of Works and Transport on their behalf.Ports oth^r than London - Troops will not be used to unloadships at ports other than London without reference to Ministers.Cargoes ether than food - Troops, where available, should beused for unloading cargoes other than food, provided theirdoing so will not cause any civilians still at- work in the docks to strike.Use of olios8. crews - lie objection is seen to ships&apos;  crewshelping tc- unload their own ships if they are willing.Unskilled miscellaneous work - Unskilled troops should be usedfor general work about the London docks.-1-
Loading of ships - This   is highly skilled work and probably more than troops can manage.     The first thing, notwithstendingthe needs of the export trade, is to unload incoming cargoes.The Departments concerned will, however, prepare plans for loading export cargoes against the time when this con be tackled.J.C.S.29th dime, 19ba3.
