THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF KIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1948SECRET Copy No.     QCP. (48) 179Qth July, 1948CABINETTHE CIVIL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Civil Aviation Committee under my Chairmanship has, at three meetings,recently reviewed the civil aircraft programme against the background of theserious position in which British civil aviation finds itself. The determination of the programme of aircraft for the three Corporations over their various routesis a highly complicated and. closely integrated business, each aspect of which isapt to react upon others. I do not propose to trouble my colleagues with all thedetail which it has been necessary to consider before coming to the recommenda-tions which I make below, but confine myself only to the salient features of thesituation on which the approval of the Cabinet seems desirable.General Backgromid2. The Cabinet will remember that the policy to &quot; Fly British &quot; was set outin the White Paper of December 1945 (Cmd. 6712) and formed the basis of decisions taken in 1946 (CM. (46) 77th Conclusions, Minute 3) and in 1947 (CM.(47) 38th Conclusions, Minute 7). The essential reason for this policy to ensurethe maintenance of the long-term position of the British aircraft industry isstill valid. In following this policy it was recognised that some years must passbefore first-class new British aircraft could be brought into service. Meanwhile,the best possible interim types of British aircraft, developed from war-time british military aircraft, were to be used, even though this would mean some temporaryfinancial loss. Departures from the policy have, however, been authorised in theordering of sis Constellations and six Boeing Stratocruisers for use by theB.O.A.C. on the North Atlantic, and, recently, in the purchase for sterling from eire of five Constellations for use by them on the route to Australia (CM. (48)30th Conclusions, Minute 11).3. The Corporations are losing money on an alarming scale. What is worse,they are losing traffic and goodwill and failing to hold their own against compe-titors using modern American aircraft. The rate of loss is bringing them intodiscredit. Their financial outlook for the next three or four years is bleak, whilepublic criticism of the rate of loss incurred by this socialised industry is not onlydiscouraging to them but hard for the Government to meet. There is also a real danger that British civil aviation might sink so low in the esteem of travellers as tobe unable to recover even when the advanced new types of British aircraft, suchas the Brabazon and the Comet which we may expect to be at least the equals ofany aircraft in their generation, come into operation in 1953-54.4. This is the background against which the specific questions affecting theprogramme of aircraft to be used by the B.O.A.C. and the B.S:A.A.C. must beconsidered. There are no problems affecting the B.E.A.C. with which T needtrouble my colleagues. ,f ,&apos;The Long-Term programme. (o) The Brabazon I. This is our principal, if not our only, hope for theNorth Atlantic route.   Work on the two prototypes is progressing satisfactorilyand, though it has still many specialised problems to be overcome, it gives promise35607
of being an aircraft of great value. SEould all go well it is hoped that it will come into service in 1953 and that by 1958 it should be capable of showing a profitin operation. .  .       -(b) The D.H. Corned-This will be jet-propelled and is intended to cruise atthe very high speed of 500 m.p.h. It is expected to be in service on the Empireroutes by 1953, but unfortunately it now appears that, initially, at least, it is unlikely to have adequate range and reserves of fuel for regular service on theNorth Atlantic. Nevertheless, much of our hope of leadership in the field of civilaviation is centred on the Comet.(c) The Bristol medium-range Empire aircraft. This aircraft, for theprototypes of which orders have been placed, will to some extent be an insurance against a failure of the Comet. It will be a more conventional type of aircraft,in effect an improved British version of the Constellation.id) The medium flying-boats.-These flying-boats, of which the latest version,the Solent, is now coming into operation, are very comfortable and have beenpopular with the public on the Empire routes. They have, however, since thewar, become uneconomic owing to the high cost of maintenance of marine airports.Under the Chicago Convention, every nation assumes an obligation to provideinternational airports for commercial aircraft. The landing fees charged forusing them do not cover more than a fraction of the cost of their provision, sothat in effect other countries bear a large proportion of the cost of landing-groundsin their territories. Other nations do not, however, operate flying-boats to anyextent, so that the full cost of providing marine airports together with passengeraccommodation at night-stops, falls upon the operators. B.O.A.C. calculate thatthe cost of this overhead expenditure during 1948-49 will be just under 2 millions. In these circumstances, the Committee recommend that the medium-sized flying-boats should not continue to be included in the operation plans of the corporations after the withdrawal from service in the natural course of theexisting types.(e) The S.RA5. This large flying-boat presents a problem of its own. - Thereare three at present on order, but B.O.A.C. do not think that, as the project has developed, this aircraft will be suitable for the North Atlantic. The cost ofmaintaining the necessary marine airports on the Empire routes would make ituneconomic for employment on those routes. B.S.A.A.C. are, however, anxiousto take the S.R.45 for their services to South America and the West Indies,and, when it is clear that the estimates of its performance are being maintained,propose to order an additional four boats. These routes admit of widely spacednatural marine bases of a relatively simple type, which can be maintained quitecheaply. The service would be based on Calshot, at the entrance to SouthamptonWater, subject to certain stipulations by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry towhich the Minister of Civil Aviation is willing to agree. The cost of these aircraft, if seven are ordered, is estimated over  1 million each, but on certainadmittedly rather optimistic assumptions about the traffic offering, B.S.A.A.C.consider that they have a reasonable chance of breaking even with them by1956-58. The economic prospects are thus somewhat doubtful, but the only alternative is to abandon altogether this ambitious project, on which much work,research and money has already been spent. From the wider national point ofview, there is everything to be said for maintaining this country&apos;s interest in the flying-boat, and the Civil Aviation Committee therefore recommend that workon the S.R.45 should go forward with a view to its employment by B.S.A.A.C.The Interim programme. So far as the North Atlantic is concerned, we have necessarily to dependduring the immediately coming years on non-British types, since, as my colleagues are aware, in the view of B.O.A.C., the Tudor I has not proved safe for operation on the North Atlantic and it has already been decided, notwithstanding therecommendations of the earlier Courtney Report (Cmd. 7307), not to press them on the Corporation for this service. The route to A australia is to be operated withthe five Constellations recently bought from Eire. The routes to South africa and to Hong Kong will continue to be operated with flying-boats.7. There are serious difficulties, however, concerning the South American,Middle East and certain Empire routes. These services are at present operated with Yorks and (to the West Indies) with three Tudor IVs. (The Tudor IV isa variant of the Tudor I.) The Yorks are.- obsolete, and both B.O.A.C. and b.S.A.A.C. wish to be rid of them from their more important routes. Thereare 16 Tudor IVs on order for B.O.A.C. which will be delivered over the period
August, 1948, to February, 1949, and also 25 Handley Page Hermes, a promisingbut as yet not fully proved type which it is hoped will be ready for service during1950. The Tudors could not in any case operate beyond Calcutta on the&quot; Kangaroo &quot; route or (until 1951) beyond Nairobi on the &quot;Springbok&quot; route,since certain airports beyond those points are unsuitable for their take-off and landing requirements.8. Finally, there are on Order for B.O.A.C. 26 Tudor IIs and for B.S.A.A.C.6 Tudor Vs (a variation of the Tudor II). These machines, the Tudor II and V,which it had been hoped to bring into service in 1946, are already two years lateand this delay, which would have brought their introduction relatively. close to that of the Hermes, combined with their disappointing performance andeconomic prospects, was already making them a most unattractive propositionto the Corporations. The Courtney Report on the Tudor II, which is being circulated separately (CP. (48) 180) brings this out. At trials held last monthat Khartoum and Nairobi, subsequent to the completion of the Courtney Report,the aircraft turned out even worse than had been feared and the Civil aviation committee has now no alternative but unanimously to recommend that the tudor II (and Tudor V) cannot be used on the Corporations&apos; scheduled services.The cost already incurred on these machines is of the order of  4 millions.9. How then is the gap in the programmes of the two Corporations to be filled ? The Corporations have already agreed among themselves that the 16Tudor IVs on order for B.O.A.C should be diverted to B.S.A.A.C., who would thus have a unified fleet of 19 Tudor IVs. The Civil Aviation committee considered two alternative methods for filling the gap in B.O.A.C.&apos;s fleet. TheMinister of Supply pointed out that the Tudor IIs and Vs could be converted into Tudor IVs within a short period and at a cost of  60,000 per aircraft by building new fuselages and he is in favour of this course. The Committee,however, with the Minister of Supply dissenting, preferred, in view of the manyuncertainties attaching to this proposal, to accept a proposal of B.O.A.C. forthe purchase of 22 Canadairs, which is discussed in the following paragraph.10. The Canadair, or DC4M, is an airframe manufactured under licencein Canada from American designs and powered with Rolls-Royce engines. Itis already proved in performance and would be ready to come into service at least as quickly as the Tudor IVs converted from Tudor IIs. In attractiveness topassengers and payload (the Canadair carries 40 passengers against 32in the Tudor IV), it is in almost all respects clearly superior to the tudor IV. Though its cost would be  175,000 per aircraft, as against theestimated additional  60,000 per aircraft needed to convert the Tudor IIs intheir present state to Tudor IVs, it is expected to prove much more economic inoperation, and over a five-year period, even after allowing for the additional costof purchase of the Canadairs, the Minister of Civil Aviation estimates that itwill cost B.O.A.C. somewhere between  5-3 millions and  13-5 millions less thana corresponding number of Tudor IVs. It would be possible to use some of theCanadairs for additional services on the North Atlantic, where the demand inmainly dollar-earning or dollar-saving traffic already exists. The Treasury aresatisfied that, in collaboration with the Canadian Government, means can be found of paying for the airframes, which will not involve any dollar outlay.11. In all the circumstances, the Civil Aviation Committee have come tothe conclusion that the right course is to purchase the 22 Canadair aircraftdesired by the B.O.A.C. In addition to the considerations set out in the preceding-paragraph, the Committee were impressed by the broad consideration that thereis a limit to the losses which Parliament and the public will be prepared to seethe Corporations incur during the immediately coming years before the new british types, of which we hope so much, come into operation. It is understoodthat even if the Canadairs are purchased we must expect losses of the order of 8-4 millions during the three years 1948-51 on the South American and Empireroutes alone. If the Empire routes are operated with Tudor IVs, these losseswill, as explained in the preceding paragraph, be very substantially increased.12. In coming to their conclusion, the Civil Aviation Committee gave full consideration to the adverse effect which such a further departure from the &quot; FlyBritish &quot; policy might have on the prestige and experience of the aircraft industry. They considered, however, that this must be weighed against the loss in national prestige which would result from the continued operation of british civil Aviation with machines falling short of the highest standard in operation
to-day. We are, in any case, faced with the regrettable disappointments withthe Tudor II, as the publication of the Courtney Report and also, I presume, ofthe report of the trials will make plain to the world. The proposed furthermodification of the &quot;Fly British&quot; policy arises solely from the abandonment of the Tudor II and will&quot; involve only certain routes (viz., those to India, ceylon and the Middle East) while confidence in the Tudor IVs and their manufacturerwill be demonstrated by their exclusive employment by the B.S.A.A.C. Finally,the employment of the Canadairs will not only further increase the prestige ofBritish aero-engines, but can be represented as a &quot;Fly Commonwealth&quot; policy.In these circumstances, I do not think that it can justifiably be said that we areattaching undue importance to minimising the losses incurred by the operatorsat the taxpayer&apos;s expense and are thereby jeopardising the British aircraft industry a national asset which for both military and economic reasons wenaturally all wish to preserve at the highest level of prestige and efficiency.13. We are hopeful that some alternative uses can be found for the tudor IIs, whether as such or converted into Tudor IVs. It may be possible toindicate to the Cabinet, when this memorandum is discussed, the results of preliminary enquiries.14. There is, however, one consideration to which I would invite the special attention of my colleagues. The switch to a non-British type of airframe involves the operator in a considerable re-equipment of his depots and re-training of hispersonnel. It would not be surprising if he were to show some reluctance to goover the ground again in the opposite direction and return to British aircraft,unless the British aircraft when they are forthcoming represented a veryconsiderable superiority over the non-British types then available. The B.O.A.C.must be given clearly to understand that they are expected to &quot; Fly British &quot; assoon as the new British types become available and that there must be no questionof the addition of the Canadair aircraft to their fleet being allowed in any wayto prejudice the introduction of the new types. There must be no thought of future withdrawal from contracts which have already been placed with british firms for these types. In fact, it is not contemplated that the Canadairs will beused on the same routes as those for which the Hermes is destined, so that on present plans this consideration will not arise until the Comet (or the M.R.E.)is ready to come into operation.Conclusions15. I ask my colleagues, therefore, to approve the following reeom-mendations : (1) That work on the Brabazon I, the Comet and the M.R.E. should be pressed forward with all possible energy.(2) That the existing types of smaller flying-boats, though remaining in service for their normal life, should not be replaced when they are withdrawn.(3) That the construction of S.R.45 flying-boats should be pressed forward,with a view to the employment of seven such boats by B.S.A.AX.(4) That the Tudor II (and its variant the Tudor V), in view of the disappointment -pointing results of its trials, should not be used on schedule sendees,out that every effort should be made by the Minister of Civil Aviation,in consultation with the Minister of Supply, to seek alternative usesfor the Tudor II and V aircraft already ordered by B.O-A.C. and&quot; B.S.A.A.C., either in their original form or converted into Tudor TVs.(5) That, to fill the gap caused by the abandonment of the Tudor IT and thetransfer to B.S.A.A.C. of the Tudor IVs on order for B.O-A.C.,B.O.A.C. should be permitted to purchase twenty-two Canadairs,provided that: (a) no dollar expenditure is involved; and(&amp;) the B.O.A.C. undertake that the introduction on their services ofnew British types as they become available is not prejudiced.(6) That the Minister of Civil Aviation be authorised to cover the above conclusions in his statement in the course of the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords on 21st Julv.A.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,9th July, 1948.
