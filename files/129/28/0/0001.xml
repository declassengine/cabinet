Printed for the Cabinet, June, 1948SECRETC.P.(48) 151xjth June, 1948.cabinet war GRIMES: CASE OF GERMAN GENERALS IN BRITISHCUSTODY   ,MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At a recent meeting of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee I was asked tosubmit, for decision of the Cabinet, the question whether certain senior German generals, atpresent detained under British control in this country, should be brought to trial. They areField Marshals von Brauchitsch, von Rundstedt and von Manstein, and Colonel GeneralStrauss. Strauss has been in our custody since May, 1945, and others since July and august, 1945.2. The question was first raised by the United States authorities in September, 1947.After the trial of the major war criminals at Nuremberg the United States authorities setup an Executive for the purpose of bringing to trial certain groups of war criminals (doctors,industrialists, etc.) and during the screening activities of this Executive a great manycaptured documents were considered. Among these was a large body of documentsindicating responsibility of these generals for war crimes, crimes against humanity andcrimes against peace. The Chief of the Executive, in forwarding a memorandum withphotostat copies of many of these documents to the Attorney-General, drew attention to thepassage in the Nuremberg Judgment relating to the German General Staff which ends  &quot; Where the facts warrant it, these men should be brought to trial so that those among themwho are guilty of these crimes should not escape punishment&quot;.3. The memorandum which is voluminous, discloses a prima facie case for various crimes,in particular the following: (a) Against all four generals, in connection with the &quot; Commissar &quot; Order, under whichpolitical commissars of the Russian Army were not to be recognized as prisonersof war and were to be liquidated.(b) Against RUNDSTEDT, in connection with the &quot; Commando &quot; Order, under whichparachutists who were taken prisoner not in connection with battle actions wereto be transferred to the Gestapo by whom they were, in fact, killed.(c) Against all four generals, for responsibility for murder and ill-treatment of allied prisoners of war, chiefly Russians.(d) Against BRAUCHITSCH, RUNDSTEDT and MANSTEIN, for certain breaches ofthe Geneva Convention arising out of the use of prisoners of war, chiefly Russians,on prohibited and dangerous work.(e) Against all four generals, for responsibility for many crimes against civilians,including the illegal execution of hostages, excessive reprisals, extermination ofSlavs, Jews and Communists and deportation into slave labour of civilians fromall the occupied territories.4. The vast majority of the victims were Russians. In point of numbers the Poles,doubtless, come second and Belgian, French, British and American victims were also involved,but in much smaller numbers. Our own direct interest is limited to the responsibility ofRUNDSTEDT for the passing on of the &quot; Commando&quot; Order in so far as our own SpecialAir Service troops were killed, pursuant to it. Many of the actual perpetrators of thesekillings have already been tried before British Military Courts. The memorandum indicatedevidence that RUNDSTEDT published a &quot; Commando&quot; Order dated 21st July, 1942 which,therefore, preceded Hitler&apos;s &quot; Commando &quot; Order of 18th October, 1942, but evidence is not included of what killings actually took place under the first Order.5. Cases had been registered with the United Nations War Crimes Commission by poland and by the U.S.A. against BRAUCHITSCH, RUNDSTEDT, and MANSTEIN, and byBelgium against BRAUCHITSCH.   In addition Poland had specifically asked for the copy No. 3 0
handing over of MANSTEIN and BRAUCHITSCH, and the U.S.S.R. have asked forRUNDSTEDT and MANSTEIN. The trial of war criminals before British Military Courtsis of course my responsibility, but the question of handing them over to other Powers is one in which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is very much interested.6. Examination of the memorandum made it clear that a vast amount of detailedpreparation and investigation of documents would be necessary before any of the generalscould be brought to trial. British translations of the documents summarised in the memor-andum have not been provided: the originals are in American custody, many in U.S.A.Evidence will be required not only to bring home to the generals responsibility for the issueof the orders referred to in the memorandum, but to establish the actual results of the issueof these orders. It should also be noted that the jurisdiction of a British Military Court is limited to war crimes ; it is not competent to try crimes against humanity or crimes againstpeace.7. Since October, 1947, this question has been the subject of correspondence and discussions between myself, the Foreign Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers.Trial by a four-power court or an Anglo-American court was considered impracticable, andan approach was therefore made to the Americans to see if they would be prepared toinclude these generals along with von LEEB and other military leaders whose trials they thenhad in hand, but their cases were too far advanced and they were unable to comply.8. There can be no doubt, I think, that if we are to undertake these trials it will benecessary to set up a special executive of picked people with specialist knowledge of thework of collecting evidence. There may be difficulty in obtaining the right people, and thefurther investigations necessary will take at least four months. It is very doubtful whether we shall, get much help from Poland and Russia, who are chiefly affected, in providingessential evidence. For the actual trials we shall have to engage first-class Counsel.Separate trials may be necessary. It will obviously be quite impossible to complete by the target date (1st September next) which the Overseas Reconstruction Committee have set for completion of outstanding war crimes trials of people in our hands awaiting trial.9. Before embarking on these further investigations, in view of the ages (RUNDSTEDT,73, STRAUSS 69, BRAUCHITSCH, 67, MANSTEIN 61), and recent history of some ofthese generals, I thought it a wise precaution to have them medically examined, particularly as to their fitness to stand trial. They have been examined by an Army Medical Board andsubsequently by a Home Office Board of two experienced prison medical officers. BothBoards agree that in the case of BRAUCHITSCH, who has had acute attacks of coronarythrombosis, the stress and strain of a prolonged trial would be likely to precipitate a furtherattack, which might well prove fatal. They agree that the other three are fit to stand trial,but think that if the trials appear likely to be prolonged beyond (say) a six months period of preparation followed by two month&apos;s trial, a further examination would be advisable in thecases of RUNDSTEDT and STRAUSS. RUNDSTEDT has arterio-sclerosis and other signsof senility, and suffers from mild depression and is potentially suicidal. STRAUSS hasangina pectoris and high blood pressure and there is a risk, likely to be increased by pro-longed stress and strain, of apoplexy or coronary thrombosis.MANSTEIN&apos;S sight is affected through cataract, but otherwise he appears healthy.10. In view of the medical report on BRAUCHITSCH, who is obviously a very sickman, I do not think we should attempt to bring him to trial. In the case of the other three,there are arguments of force on both sides. On the one hand it may be felt that we have a duty to try the officers, in accordance with the principles enunciated at Nuremberg, if theevidence warrants it, that we ought not to let senior officers who incited the commission ofwar crimes go unscathed when many subordinates who actually carried out such crimes havebeen tried and sentenced, and that public opinion at home and abroad may be critical of ourletting them go free. On the other hand there is the time, expense and man-power involvedin staging these further trials of senior officers who have already been in our hands nearly three years, at a time when many people hoped that such trials were finished, our ownrelatively small direct interest, the difficulties involved in preparation of the cases and un-certainty whether essential evidence will be forthcoming, particularly from our eastern war-time Allies, the possibility that RUNSTEDT or STRAUSS may collapse or commit suicidebefore or during their trials, the ages of the three generals and unlikelihood that the death sentence will be inflicted if passed and the fact that they can still be detained in custody orkept under control if a danger to security. It may be mentioned that we have already triedeleven German generals before British Military Courts. Four were sentenced to death, but none, in fact, executed. ...   ;     -On balance, my own view is that it is not worth while, at this date, undertaking theheavy task of attempting to bring these three generals to trial.
ii. In the meantime, we have had a request from the United States Executive inNuremberg for medical certificates indicating the state of health of RUNDSTEDT,MANSTEIN and BRAUCHITSCH who have been asked for as defence witnesses in the high command case now pending there. It is anticipated that Defence Counsel will produceaffidavits from them and represent that they are too sick to travel, but the U.S. authoritiesthink it most desirable that they should be available for cross-examination in open court ifpossible. It is believed that their presence would be required in the very near future. Inview of our medical reports and the recent visit of RUNSTEDT to Germany, I think it canbe assumed that RUNSTEDT and MANSTEIN would be fit, but not BRAUCHITSCH.12. If it should be decided that the four generals are not to be tried by a British court and are not to be handed over to any other power for trial, their ultimate disposal must beconsidered. The Foreign Office think that after their return to the British Zone of Germany,it is likely that renewed applications will be made for their extradition either to Poland or tothe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Military Governor of the British Zone of Ger-many, in accordance with the second conclusion of the meeting of the Overseas Reconstruc-tion Committee of 12th April, has recently decided and announced in Berlin that all applica-tions from foreign powers for the extradition of persons alleged to have committed crimesagainst peace, war crimes or crimes against humanity, should be presented on or before 1stSeptember, 1948 ; any application for extradition made or presented after that date will be sanctioned only in the case of a person against whom a clear prima facie case of murder, as defined in the German Penal Code, is made out and not otherwise. The Foreign Office there-fore suggest that if the four generals are not to be handed over, they should not he returnedto the British Zone of Germany until after 1st September, and that as the3r are at present in hospital it would not be unreasonable to retain them there until after that date although their normal date for return would be not later than 12th July. On their return to theBritish Zone of Germany, BRAUCHITSCH, MANSTEIN and STRAUSS would technicallyface denazification process but would in fact probably only be so examined if they applied for employment. If RUNDSTEDT chose to return to his home in the United States Zonehe would face denazification process, whether or not he applied for employment.It is true that the four generals are at present in hospital, but while BRAUCHITSCHand MANSTEIN are genuine hospital patients (MANSTEIN with his eye trouble), RUND-STEDT and STRAUSS, though needing regular medical attention, are held in a hospital only because there is no convenient camp in which to hold them. The hospital in which they are held will not close on 12th July because the disposal of Ukrainian hospital cases held therehas not yet been decided. When the Ukrainians cease to be held, some special arrangements would have to be made according to the conditions then prevailing.I would also point out that Poland applied to the War Office for the hand over ofBRAUCHITSCH and MANSTEIN on 1st December, 1947, while they were in custody in thiscountry, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics applied to the Military Governor forthe hand over of RUNDSTEDT and MANSTEIN on nth March, 1948, when they were inthis country and not in the British Zone of Germany. The decision on the Russian request was therefore not one for the Military Governor to make, and I understand that he repliedaccordingly. It seems to me a little difficult in these circumstances to make a refusal to hand over hinge on the Military Governor&apos;s decision that applications for extraditionmust be made before 1st September, if we hold the generals in this country until after1st September and then send them to the British Zone of Germany. I suggest that a refusal to hand them over, if decided upon, should be taken and maintained on the merits.13. I invite my colleagues to decide :(a) whether we should bring all or any of the four generals to trial;(&amp;) if not, whether we should hand over to other Powers those who have been asked forby them;(c) how we should dispose of the generals if it is decided not to bring them to trial or to hand them over to any power;(d) whether we should agree that the generals asked for by the Americans as witnessesin the pending trials at Nuremberg should be made available, if certified fit to travel.The War Office, E.S.17th June, 1948.(B4S/161)   100   6/48   w.o.p.   29922r
