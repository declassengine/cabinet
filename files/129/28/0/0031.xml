(48) 181Ibth July, 1948GABINETIRON AND STEEL bill note by the Lord President of the CouncilIN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 14th June, 1948 (CM. (48)39th Conclusions, Minute 5) the Socialisation of Industries Committee have examined the arguments which should be used in support of the provisions ofthe Iron and Steel Bill; and the Minister of Supply and I are now in a positionto report the Committee&apos;s conclusions.The Committee suggest that, when the Bill is published, Ministers and othermembers of the Government should advocate the provisions of the Iron and steel bill on the lines outlined in the attached memorandum. It is undesirable that ministers, before the Bill is introduced, should refer to these arguments in public speeches unless after consultation with the Minister of Supply or myself, sincetactically it would be preferable to refrain from indulging in detailed politicalargument on the Bill until it has been published and the full case in its favourcan be deployed.The Committee desired me to draw the attention of the Cabinet to paragraph 7of the attached memorandum which gives grounds for socialisation based on theneeds of the European Recovery Programme. It may be desirable that something like this might be said, provided that it is not felt that we are thereby seemingto dictate to other European countries how they should control their iron andsteel industries.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council. S.W. 1,15th July, 1948.IRON AND STEEL BILLReview of Arguments1. No one seriously suggests that the structure and methods used for operating the British iron and steel industry before the war would be satisfactoryor defensible for the future. Before 1933 the industry was more or less free from government control and after 1933 it was subject to a certain limited amount of supervision by the Import Duties Advisory Committee. The industry has moveda long way from the attitudes and policies prevalent as recently as in the &apos; thirtiesand its development plan, prepared in response to a Coalition government&apos;s decision in 1945, represents what would before the war have been regarded as a radical and untried experiment. The past history of the pre-war steel industry with its misdeeds and failings as well as its successes is not, therefore, highlyrelevant to the Bill.   But, for the same reasons, the industry is hardly entitled35611 b&apos;
to claim that a theoretical and arbitrary experiment is being substituted for awell-tried system which was working perfectly efficiently. It is tacitly agreed on all sides that the pre-war system must be radically changed. The problem thenation has to decide is whether the fairly radical change in effect proposed by theowners of the iron and steel industry is, or is not, preferable to the more drasticchange proposed by the Government.2. The arguments may conveniently be reviewed under the following heads: (a) What the nation requires from the iron and steel industry.(b) Development and finance.(c) Marketing and price policy.(d) Labour relations and conditions.(e) Organisation and administration.(/) Short-term considerations.(A) What the nation requires of the iron and steel industry.3. The future security and wealth of Great Britain and the part it can play in the world are more closely bound up with the possession of a modern, efficient,expansionist iron and steel industry than probably with any other single branchof manufacture. The dependence of economic progress on steel, which has long been marked, is becoming even greater. We are having to put a larger share of our national resources into metal-using and engineering industries and these industriescan be and are at present seriously handicapped by inadequate steel supplies. Infuture they might be even more seriously crippled by being unable to get steel atworld competitive prices a frequent complaint by the British motorcar industry for years before the war. Failure by the steel industry to respond sufficientlyquickly to technical and market changes affecting steel users might also be disastrous for our balance of payments. No responsible Government, therefore,could contemplate leaving to chance the question whether the managers of an industry, of such life and death importance to the national economy, would beable and willing to do the best possible job for the nation. The private enterprisebasis in the accepted sense is not possible for iron and steel because there can beno guarantee that considerations of profitability for particular sets of shareholders,over the period for which their firms would choose to budget, would not lead tofailure to develop or even maintain facilities and supplies which would be essential to the economic or military strength of the nation. Therefore, either the firms would have to be over-ruled or persuaded by tariffs or otherwise (as theyoften were before the war), or the nation would be economically or strategicallyweakened. An iron and steel industry without far-reaching public controlmay sound attractive in terms of classical economics, but it is not a practicablepossibility for a responsible British Government of any political complexion.The area of argument, therefore, narrows itself to consideration whether acontrolled, but privately owned, iron and steel industry could co-operate sufficientlyclosely to do all that the State would be bound to require of it without losing theadvantages claimed for private enterprise. It is clear that such control wouldinvolve risks of conflict between the State and the private owners who must be concerned with their dividends and who, generally speaking, could not be forced,for instance, to spend money at rates or in directions contrary to their wishes.In these conditions directors and managements would be faced with frequentconflicts of loyalties, which in the strains and stresses which result, must beweakening to the State or to the industry or more probably to both. Theseconflicts would not arise under common ownership.4. Moreover, there are divergencies of interest over the scale of expansionof the iron and steel industry. From a national standpoint, both economically and strategically, it is better to risk some over-development of iron and steelcapacity in order to guard against a recurrence of the present position where the economy is being throttled down by steel shortage, or the war-time position wherethe war effort is cramped by lack of steel, even if the outcome is that at certainperiods a part of the steel capacity does not need to be fully utilised. On theother hand it is in the interest of private owners of the steel industry to keep theindustry well on the small side as measured against future national needs inorder to transfer as far as possible to other industries at home and abroad the difficult problems of adjustment to peak demands. Even the United States steelindustry, which has a far more expansionist tradition than ours, was most reluctant to increase its capacity early in the war to levels which are now generally
3183admitted to be by no means excessive for American peace-time needs. The UnitedStates steel industry&apos;s calculation of post-war demand is now seen to have beengrossly under-stated owing largely to this inherent bias, and a similar tendencyis visible in the British industry. If. we were to use as much steel as America in proportion to population our steel capacity would need to be just twice what itis now and although this is obviously over-ambitious, private steel industry here and elsewhere has an inherent tendency to set its sights too low and to make itsforecasts of demand come true only by exercising a restrictive influence on the restof the economy.Put quite briefly, the position is that in our present economic situation, the capacity of the iron and steel industry must be expanded beyond the conservativesize which directors answerable to private shareholders would regard as prudent to achieve. Only the State can effect this expansion. Private enterprise followsdemand; the State can anticipate it and prepare for it.5. In terms of economic planning, steel is so vital and comes in at so earlya stage that it is doubtful whether any economic planning worth the name can berealised on the basis of a privately owned steel industry. The private operators of the steel industry cannot be expected to operate with complete impartiality inthe public interest. They must have regard to their commercial and other connec-tions, and this gravely weakens the socially necessary priorities and allocationsystems by the weight which they give to these commercial interests and by theirday-to-day practice in delivering steel differentially to different consumers againstforward orders. Unless a private industry is to be saddled with a bureaucracywhich would hamstring its daily operations, these tendencies cannot be controlled and they are inherent in the private enterprise structure.6. Strategically, as possible future warfare becomes more highly mechanised,iron and steel become relatively even more vital, and indeed iron and steel capacity is possibly the best single index of the war potential of a modern State. the factors which induced Tudor and Stuart monarches to make arsenals and dockyardsthe first nationalised industries are pressing powerfully for similar treatment of iron and steel. The growing security problems affecting new weapons are afurther consideration and it might become a source of grave embarrassment thatplants vital to national security could be controlled by directors under contractualor unwritten obligations to pool technical information and developments withpotential enemies.7. The European reconstruction programme and Western Union are intro-ducing a further factor likely to prove of growing importance. If closereconomic integration of Western Europe is ever to mean anything the iron andsteel industry must be at the heart of it. This means that, if the iron and steelindustry of Western Europe is to be effectively integrated on economic and strategic grounds, the necessary regulation must be carried out under Governmentauspices rather than left to the free play of private enterprise. Questions suchas the right location of new developments on economic and strategic grounds arealready arising and are likely to become of growing importance. The sort of difficulties which arose over Ebbw Vale before the war, where social and strategic considerations conflict with the wishes of private managements, may be repeatedon a European scale before long. The Government would not presume to say how these difficulties should be met by other European countries; but, in the circumstances-stances of this country, the Government is satisfied that nothing short of public ownership will give the necessary degree of effective control.(B) Development and Finance8. There are many possible variants in the direction and pace of developmentof a modern iron and steel industry any one of which may be argued to beeconomic. There is not one &quot; economic &quot; line of development which is right anda whole number of alternatives which are uneconomic and therefore wrong.Everything depends on the pace of research and development work, the terms onwhich finance can be provided, the period over which the budget runs and plant isamortised, the possibilities of reciprocal arrangements with overseas producers(e.g., of semi-finished steel), and many other factors which are themselves shapedpartly by conscious policy and partly by outside forces. Any group of managersfor the steel industry will, therefore, be* compelled to make a number of arbitraryforecasts and decisions within their own discretion. The degree to which theseforecasts and decisions will be harmonised with national needs will depend largely35611
on whether managers feel themselves responsible to the nation and identify then-interests with national needs, or whether they are responsible to some sectionalbody which will be constantly tempted to take a different view, particularly inbases where companies controlling steel works are themselves identified withparticular users or suppliers.9. the argument that the huge necessary developments in the steel industry can best be financed on Government terms has some force, since cheaper moneymeans to that extent cheaper steel. It is true that at the present time the steelindustry is in a position on its own credit to finance its immediate expansion programme,-but there is no guarantee that it can do so for future schemes ofdevelopment: and in any event the problem in terms of national economic policy isto provide the real resources of man-power and materials out of which new development on a large scale can be realised, rather than merely to. find money.There is the further point that -investment authorised in other fields for purposesof construction, export, &amp;c, can be rendered abortive unless correspondingdevelopments are set in hand by the steel industry in order to provide the rightsupplies at the right time. In fact, whoever controls the steel industry holds aright of veto over the development of the engineering industries.(C) Marketing and Price Policy10. The steel industry inevitably becomes closer and closer to a monopolyand a cartel and indeed pre-war Governments were compelled as a lesser evil topress cartel arrangements on those leaders of the industry who were most fervidlyin favour of competition- With the best will in the world, the industry in privatehands cannot help wielding dangerous monopoly powers. No doubt existing price levels may be sufficient to cover the costs of the higher cest producers and thereforemay give an excessive profit margin to the more efficient. This may be inevitableon the argument that we need every ton of steel at present almost regardless of cost, but the steel shortage is likely to. persist even after the sellers&apos; market endsand it may then become essential to find some method of keeping high cost unitstemporarily in production without inflating the price structure of the whole industry for that purpose. This could readily be done under socialisation, but itmay lead to abuse under private enterprise.(D) Labour Relations and Conditions11. The steel industry has an excellent record of labour relations and is not,therefore, likely to suffer from the acute initial management difficulties apparentin an industry such as coalmining, where labour relations have been ineptlyhandled for many years. Thanks to this excellent tradition some of the advantages of socialisation in the labour relations field should be more readily reaped in steelthan in industries such as coalmining, and while the owners are fully entitled to claim that this is evidence of their capacity to continue running the industry, itis from a practical standpoint an indication that recent achievements and recordsmight be still further improved on under socialisation, which would not in this case have to deal with an unpleasant legacy from the past. At the same time conditions as regards canteens, welfare, &amp;c, could be improved with advantage in the less progressive units which should be brought up to the level of the best.&quot;(E) Organisation and A dministration12. One of the mdst important arguments for socialisation is that undersingle public ownership there will be infinitely better scope for effecting rationalisation -sation, elimination of wasteful competition and proper physical industrial plan-ning than under the present diversified private ownership. Efficiency in theindustry depends more and more on effective team work between those responsiblefor different processes and complete integration of working between plants-manyof which are at present in different hands and cannot readily, under private ownership, be led to co-operate with sufficient closeness or given a commonfinancial interest. Even where such arrangements can be made under the presentsystem they are a great tax on the time aiid energy of leaders of the industry whohave to give much thought and patience to pacts and negotiations, the need forwhich would be largely removed by socialisation. Public ownership will give better results than close public cdhtrbl over private ownership. All experiencegoes to show that public control in certain spheres without public ownership can-regulate and check development; but cannot secure positive action of a forward-looking, expansionist character.
(F) Short-term Considerations13. One of the strongest arguments against socialisation at this stage isthat it would upset and dislocate the industry at a time when every ton of steelis needed. Experience of other recent socialisation measures does not bear thisout. The coal owners and the electricity supply corporations were opposed on principle to socialisation and certainly less used to subordinating company to industry interests than are the leaders of iron and steel, and in both cases therewas an even more critical shortage of their output at the time of socialisation,yet there is no evidence that unsettlement over the process of transfer led to any significant slackening in output.14. It may be argued that iron and steel is more intricate and technical andwould, therefore, be more largely affected. This depends very much on the attitudeof the managers and technicians. Certainly, if considerable elements among themmade obstacles to co-operation like the doctors and dentists and were preparedto leave the industry, this argument would have a good deal of force. But this is unlikely to happen in an industry where the special skill and experience of the managers would be of little help to them in getting good jobs elsewhere.15. The fact that it is proposed to socialise on. a basis of existing companies and not by setting up new boards is an important safeguard against dislocation,which in most cases would approximate more closely to the very mild process ofsocialising the Bank of England or Cable and Wireless, rather than the more drastic process of superseding large numbers of colliery companies by the N.C.B.and its intricate and novel subordinate bodies.16. A more serious difficulty is that on present form the fate of the industryseems likely to be a pivotal point of the next General Election. There is no sayingwhat unsettlement might be introduced by political controversy at that time andit is certainly the responsibility of the Government on its side to see that every-thing possible is done to insulate the current operation of the industry from the controversy which will be going on over its head.On the other side, it may fairly be argued that unsettlement and uncer-tainty about the future will be reduced rather than increased by the Bill whichhas been hanging over the industry so long that it has inevitably affected the atmosphere in which development and day-to-day operations have to be conducted.17. Much will depend not only on the weight of the respective cases, buton the atmosphere which is created. It is most important, therefore, that theintroduction of recriminations and emotionalism should be strictly avoided fromthe Government side. The Government being responsible for the national economy has an interest in ensuring that whatever decisions are reached aboutiron and steel are discussed and settled with the utmost calmness and goodwill,and that an atmosphere of crisis, partisanship and division is avoided.Points to Avoid18. We must seek to carry the technicians and the workers with us. There-fore it is suggested that Government spokesmen should take particular care toavoid getting involved in arguments such as the following :  (a) Misdeeds of the Industry before the War. There are a number oftempting debating points, such as cartels, price policy, the Sir WilliamFirth incident, &amp;c. It must be recognised, however, that full informa-tion on matters of this character is available only to the Federation,and that in most if not all of the major issues the Federation had thetacit or open acquiescence of the Government of the day for what it did. While we may disagree with the Government policies of thattime (and fundamentally those policies were restrictionist), we shouldbe on dangerous ice in blackguarding an industry for having fallen in with current Government views. The right line is to emphasise thearguments on general grounds set out above in favour of public owner-ship rather than control, and to use the public suspicions and doubtsin regard to the policy of the industry which developed during thepre-war period of I.D.A.C. control, as evidence of the inherent weak-nesses of such a system of control, without explicitly endorsing thosesuspicions or accusing the leaders of the industry of&apos; discreditablebehaviour.(6) Financial Domination by &quot; the City.&quot; For each of the major publiccompanies the voting rights are exercisable by several thousand share-
holders, and there is no factual evidence to support any allegationthat there are at present organised groups in a position to exercise&quot; control.&quot; The Prudential and other insurance companies and finance houses are trustees for the debenture holders in some cases,but they have no rights save in the event of default. Acquisitionof debentures in industrial concerns is a normal means of investment for surplus funds of insurance companies.(c) Subsidies. Exchequer subsidies are now being paid in respect of ironand steel at a rate of about  22 million a year, but it should not be suggested that this money is being paid to bolster a bankrupt industry or that it is distributed among the shareholders. This subsidy, whichis analogous to the food subsidies, has developed out of war circum-stances, and is payable to keep down the costs of steel to the steel-consuming industries. Of the  22 million,  9 million represents thedifference between the cost of imported iron and steel and the con-trolled selling price in Great Britain;  7 million is assistance towardsthe high cost of freight on imported ore (and this is kept high in theabsence of outward coal cargoes);  5 million is towards the cost of imported scrap. After nationalisation it may well be found thatit is in the public interest to maintain some of these subsidies inorder to avoid a sharp rise in price consequent on paying world prices for imported materials.(d) Suggestion of Inefficiency or Mismanagement. There is no concreteevidence which can be adduced for inefficiency or mismanagement onthe part of those now in control of the iron and steel industry, and thecurrent output records justify this contention. It can no doubt be argued that certain plants are inefficient, out of date, and badly sited,but the responsibility for this legacy can hardly be placed on thepresent generation of those in control. As indicated in previousparagraphs, it is most important not to alienate directors, manage-ments and technicians; accordingly sweeping generalisations about their incompetence should be eschewed, and credit given for their recent achievements.Conclusion19. The industry is now on its best behaviour and particularly anxious togive the Government no argument which it could use that &apos;&apos; the steel barons &quot;are acting contrary to the public interest. For this reason they are particularlyamenable to Government policy on such matters as increased production, limita-tion of prices, restriction of dividends, location of industry, co-operation in theDistribution Scheme, &amp;c. On these matters we have no serious ground for com-plaint. As indicated in paragraph 18 (a) above, we should be in difficulties aboutattacking in detail their pre-war record. Our case must rest on the part whichthis industry must play in the future economy of the country and our generalpropaganda should be on the lines indicated in paragraphs 3 to 12 above.
