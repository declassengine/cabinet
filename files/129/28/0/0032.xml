SECRETCP. (48) 18210th July, 1948CABINETFUTURE OF THE TUDOR AIRCRAFT AND OF THE &quot;FLY BRITISH &quot;policy memorandum by the Minister of supply agree with all the conclusions in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper (CP. (48) 179)except the recommendation from which I strongly dissent-that 22 D.C.4M-4&apos;s(Canadair 4&apos;s) should be purchased for operation by B.O.A.C. on the Empireroutes and on the North Atlantic during the next tew years instead of AvroTudor IVs, which can be built from the uncompleted Tudor IPs at an additional cost of  60,000 per aircraft. The D.C.4M-4 is an American aircraft,designed by the Douglas Aircraft Corporation, California, and manufacturedunder licence at Quebec by Canadair Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary ofan American company. The engines are British Rolls Royce Merlins, as in theTudors, but the airf rame, propellers, instruments and equipment are American.Summary of Objections to the Purchase of D.C.4M&apos;s2. The purchase of these D.C.4M-4&apos;s would be a far greater departure from the &apos; &apos;fly British &apos;&apos; policy than any hitherto agreed. There are also a numberof special reasons which, in my view, make this proposal particularly objectionable.In summary they are : (a) There is no question here of a superior foreign aircraft versus an inferiorBritish one. The D.C.4M-4 and the Tudor IV are both excellentaeroplanes and, as is shown in a statement agreed by my Department,the Ministry of Civil Aviation and B.O.A.C. and reproduced as an appendix to this paper, they are approximately equal in speed, range&apos; and passenger comfort.(&amp;) The abandonment by B.O.A.C. of the Tudor would mean the scrapping ofall, or most of  4 millions worth of aeroplanes and aeroplane partsnow lying at A. V. Roe&apos;s, and the dismissal and unemployment of nearly 1,700 aircraft workers and technicians in South Lancashire andCheshire.(c) The abandonment by B.O.A.C. of the Tudor and the decision to fly in its place an American aeroplane would have serious effects on: (i) The technical advancement of British aviation.(ii) The export prospects of British aircraft.(iii) War potential.(d) There would be strong political opposition from both sides of the house and from outside it, particularly from organised labour in the manchester area, if foreign aircraft were purchased and the bulk ofthe Tudors scrapped..(e) The financial advantages to be gained from the purchase of D.C.4M&apos;s (ofthe order of  1 million a year for 3-5 years) are relatively smallcompared with the total expenditure on civil aviation, and would be faroutweighed by the damage inflicted on British aviation in the widestsense.(/) On the assumption that the D.C.4M&apos;s would have to be paid for sooner or later in dollars, the net dollar earning capacity of the Tudor IVswould exceed that of the D.C.4M&apos;s by an amount which I estimate,from B.O.A.C.&apos;s own figures, to be at least 10 million dollars over fiveyears, and possibly much more.Copy No.31THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT    &apos;Printed for the Cabinet.

Previous Plans for Operation of the Tudor IV by B.O.A.C.3. The present opposition of B.O.A.C. to the use of the Tudor IVs is plainlybased on the Corporation^ natural desire to fly the most economic aeroplaneobtainable, whatever its origin, so that their losses may be reduced as much aspossible. There can be no radical objection by B.O.A.C. to the Tudor IVs on technical grounds, because only recently they were anxious to have them, and indeed resisted persistent applications for the release of some of these aircraft to be.S.A.A. After the publication of the Interim Report of the Courtney Committeeon the Tudor I last January, B.O.A.C. and A.V. Roe issued a joint press state-ment which said &quot; the Corporation and the Company will co-operate fully inorder that the Tudor aircraft should be put into operation on the B.O.A.C. routesat the earliest possible moment.&quot; Moreover, as late as 8th April the then Ministerof Civil Aviation, in a paper he submitted to the Civil Aviation Committee,recommended that the B.O.A.C. services to India, Ceylon and West Africa shouldbe operated by 16 Tudor IV aircraft pending the introduction of the Hermes IV.The conversion of 16 Tudor I&apos;s for this purpose was put in hand by myDepartment in April at the request of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and withthe approval of the Treasury, at an estimated total cost of about  300,000.B.O.A.C. are now asking that these 16 Tudor IVs should be transferred to be.S.A.A. and the D.C.4M-4&apos;s purchased in their place at a capital cost of about 4 million.Comparison of the D.C.4M-4 and the Tudor IV4. There is little difference between the D.C.4M--1 and the Tudor IV inrange, speed and passenger amenities. It should be borne in mind, in studying the comparison in the Appendix, that the assumed figures for the D.C.4M-4 representthe estimated effect of improvements which the manufacturers claim to be able tointroduce in the D.C.4M-2 (which is the version now flying). Such expectationsare frequently disappointed in practice. The Tudor IV figures, on the other hand,are those obtained from actual experience in operation, and make no allowance for improvements obtainable with further development. Refrigeration will beavailable in the D.C.4M-4 but not (for the present) in the Tudor IV, though thereis a development programme to provide this, and other more substantial improve-ments, as soon as possible. The completion of the Tudor II&apos;s as Tudor IVs,which have the same wings, undercarriage, power plants and instruments but adifferent fuselage, involves no production difficulty. They would be of the samestandard as the Tudor IVs now being regularly operated by B.S.A.A..on the north atlantic with, of course, a full certificate of airworthiness. Delivery of sixteen ofthese aircraft in addition to the sixteen already being converted from Tudor I&apos;s,could be made within a year. I doubt whether an equal number of D.C.4M-4&apos;s(which have not yet obtained a certificate of airworthiness) could be obtained assoon.Small Extent of the Financial Advantage from Purchase of D.C.4M-4&apos;s5. The completion of Tudor II&apos;s as Tudor IVs could be carried out at anadditional cost of about  60,000 each, over and above the commitments alreadyincurred on the Tudor II contract, whereas I understand that the purchase priceof D.C.4M-4&apos;s is approximately  175,000 each. Because of their larger seatingcapacity (they carry forty passengers as against the Tudor IVs thirty-two) it isestimated that additional revenue would be earned by the D.C.4M-^ &apos;s, thusenabling B.O.A.C. to reduce their deficit. Leaving out of account the loss to theExchequer of nearly  4 millions on the Tudor II contract, the Minister of CivilAviation in Appendix A to C.A.C. (48) 15 estimated that the total losses likelyto be incurred by B.O.A.C. on the Empire routes over the three years 1948-51 ifTudor IVs are operated would amount to  10-3 million. If D.C.4M-4&apos;s areoperated instead he estimates that the losses will be reduced to  7-3 million.When the Atlantic route is brought into the calculation the financial difference is increased to about  5 million over five years, but, on the other hand, the net dollar earnings from Tudor IVs would be higher by an amount which I estimate, fromB.O.A.C.&apos;s own figures to be at least 10 million dollars, and possibly much more.The total expenditure on civil aviation at the present time is of the order of  40million a year. While I fully appreciate the importance of reducing the heavy losses at present being incurred by the airline Corporations, I cannot believe thatthe advantages to be gained by a saving of about  1 million a year for the next three to five years can be sufficient to justify a major retreat from the &quot; flyBritish &quot; policy which the Government have so often proclaimed their intention of
187maintaining, and which has the support of all political parties. It has been generally accepted as inevitable that, for at least five years after the end of the war,British land planes in the larger classes are likely to be less economic than someAmerican types. It has also been well known that substantial subsidies would benecessary, partly on account of this. Provision was in fact made in the CivilAviation Act for subsidies until 1956. Nothing that has happened since thepassing of that Act justifies an abandonment of the &quot; fly British &quot; policy, which isas necessary now as when it was first universally acclaimed in 1945.Difficulty of re-establishing &quot; fly British &quot; once abandoned6. The proposed purchase of 22 D.C. 4M&quot;&quot;s would bring the total value of american aircraft (including spares) in service with, or on order for, B.O.A.C.to over  10 million. American aircraft would overwhelmingly predominate intheir main line fleets, and their engineering organisation on the landplane side would be so completely tied to American practices and standards that to changeback to British would be a major operation which the Corporation would have every excuse for postponing again and again. Moreover, in order to obtainthe best financial results, the heavy capital outlay on American aircraft,maintenance depots and spares would have to be amortised over as long a period as possible. Re-equipment might therefore be delayed until long after thetime when demonstrably superior British types become available. There is, indeed,a grave risk that the &quot; fly British &quot; policy would thus be postponed sine dieso far as B.O.A.C. are concerned, and no amount of protestation on their partshould, in view of their record, delude us into thinking otherwise. Certainly theaircraft industry itself, including competitors of A. V. Roe &amp; Co., Ltd., understand the gravity of the situation and do not take seriously the suggestion that theAmerican purchases would be merely to tide us over an interim period.Consequences for British Aviation&quot;7. If B.O.A.C. were permitted to buy the D.C. 4M-4&apos;s in place of theTudors wider national interests would suffer in the following ways :-(a) Denial of Operational Experience to British Designers. In the design of new types of aircraft operational experience with preceding typesin regular service and under all conditions is of vital importance.This applies not only to the aircraft structure itself but to allassociated equipment, instruments and accessories. Not merelyA. V. Roe &amp; Co., Ltd., but many other British firms at present strivingto regain the ground lost during the war in the civil aircraft field,will suffer if the Tudor does not go into operation on B.O.A.C.&apos;s aswell as B.S.A.A.&apos;s routes. Apart from a few Yorks and Solentflying boats, B.O.A.C. would have no British aircraft in service atall for the next two years or more. It is true that the Hermes IVis planned to come into service on the Empire routes in 1950, butthis type would replace the Yorks and Solents, not the Constellationsand D.C. 4M-4&apos;s. It would indeed be a travesty of nationalisationif the principal State airline should thus facilitate the work of thedesigners of American aircraft while depriving the British industry of that operational experience and close collaboration which is vital to the development of successful designs.(&amp;) Damage to our Export Trade. The attitude of B.O.A.C. towards theTudors, as reflected in the reports of the Courtney Committee, hasalready had a most discouraging effect on potential foreign customers,and an order from the Argentine worth over a million pounds hasbeen cancelled. Any purchase of aircraft from dollar countries would,in our present economic difficulties, be interpreted by foreign buyersas showing complete lack of confidence, not merely in the particularBritish type which is rejected, but in all British types of comparablesize. Purchase of D.C. 4M&apos;s will therefore seriously diminish theexport prospects of the Hermes as well as the Tudor. Evende Havillands, who have hitherto been confidently planning for an output of two Comets a month, are now hesitating, for fear of theserious reactions on all British aircraft, including their own, of therumoured abandonment of the &apos;fly British &apos;&apos; policy.(c) Damage to British War Potential. After the first world war, K.L.M.,the Dutch airline, were allowed to buy their aircraft where they liked;35612 b 2
the result was the establishment of a commercially successful airlinebut the extinction of a promising Dutch aircraft industry. the pursuit of a short-sighted financial policy in British civil aviationmight well leave us with a second-rate aircraft industry, with allthat this implies to our national security. The purchase of D.C.4M&apos;S would result in a large number of Tudors having to be cancelled, since it is very unlikely that alternative uses could be found for more thana few, even if they were disposed of to privately-owned chartercompanies and others at a knock-down price. A. V. Roe &amp; Co., Ltd.,would be forced to dismiss from their Manchester factories up to1,700 workpeople, many of them highly skilled aircraft workers,and it would be impossible to keep the capacity and skilled labour of the firm adequately employed until the new military designs onwhich they are engaged (including a project to which the Air Staffattach the highest importance) are ready for production. In factserious damage to the war potential of A. V. Roe &amp; Co., Ltd., andsome of the suppliers of equipment could be avoided only if it were decided, at heavy cost to the taxpayer,, to continue production inexcess of requirements.Political Considerations8. B.O.A.C. have always resented the Governments &quot;fly British&quot; policy as an intrusion on their right to purchase and fly whatever aeroplane theyconsider commercially the most attractive. Moreover, they have been sensitiveto the recent criticism of the continued heavy subsidies which are being paidito them, which they regard as a slur on the efficiency of their administration.It is, I think, largely this criticism, considered by some of my colleagues asdamaging to the Governments nationalisation policy, which has led them tosupport the purchase of the commercially more attractive D.C. 4M-4.9. I suggest, however, that nothing is to be gained by attempting to appeasethis criticism, which is partly politically inspired and partly based on a miscon-ception, by modifying our &apos;&apos; fly British &apos;&apos; policy. No one will congratulate theGovernment for reducing the civil aviation subsidy from, say,  8 million to 7 million per annum. On the other hand, I am convinced there will be a vehe-ment and much more dangerous attack on the Government and the Corporationsif, after all the troubles which the Tudors have gone through, we abandon themfor an American alternative, with all the serious consequences set out above, justat the time when they have been developed into an excellent aeroplane such asthe Tudor IV.10. I suggest, however, that steps can and should be taken at the earliest opportunity to stop our critics getting away with it. They can be effectivelyanswered by an authoritative Government statement setting out the immensenational advantages which accrue to our aviation industry, our exports, our full employment policy and national defence from the &quot;fly British&quot; policyand the subsidy it involves. There is no reason at all why we should be on the defensive in this matter and I am sure that a forthright statement of our case would hearten our supporters and confound our critics.The Purpose of Nationalisation11. Finally, in considering this problem we must keep in mind our purpose in nationalising this or any other industry. It is surely to fit the economicsof that industry into the framework of our national planning. That is a concept-tion which B.O.A.C. have always rejected. This basic issue is sharply defined in the present controversy. If the purpose of nationalisation is to provide, asfar as possible, for the separate financial prosperity of each nationalised concern,then of course we must accept B.O,A.C.&apos;s request to fly a, more economic aeroplanerather a British one. I assume, however, that it is our policy that the nationalisedcivil aviation industry should not stand by itself as a viable entity outside theambit of overall national planning, but that it should be made to play its partin national reconstruction. If that is accepted, as surely it must be, there isan overwhelming case for insisting that B.O.A.C. fly Tudor IVs and notD.C. 4M-4&apos;s.G. R. S.Ministry of Supply, W..C. 2,10th July, 1948.
5188APPENDIXAgreed Statement of Comparison between Tudor IV and D.C.4 M-4(Canadair Four)1. PayloadAccording to figures in the manufacturers brochure, the D.C.4 M-4 will carry approximately 1,500 lbs. more payload than the Tudor IV over averagestages for the same all up weight of 80,000 lb.The planned operating weight of the D.C.4 M-4 (which Canadair Ltd. areprepared to guarantee) is 82,000 lb. The payload will be correspondinglyincreased.2. Cruising Speed and RangeThe two aircraft have the same maximum effective fuel capacity. TheCanadair is slightly faster than the Tudor IV cruising under the same conditions.For this reason the Canadair has a slightly longer range.3. StrengthThe Tudor IV has been designed to meet somewhat higher strength require-ments than the D.C.4 M-4. The latter is already considerably developed, sincethe original weight was 63,000 lb., whereas the Tudor still has considerable room for development to take more powerful engines (e.g., Hercules 763 or Griffon).The maximum permissible landing weight for the Tudor IV is 74,000 lbs. corn-pared with 68,000 lbs. for the D.C.4 M-4.4. Passenger AmenitiesThe standard of comfort is approximately the same in both aircraft, the tudor IV carrying 32 passengers, the Canadair Four 40 passengers.The pressurisation system on the Tudor IV maintains the cabin altitudeat 5,000 ft., while cruising at 20,000, as compared with 8,000 ft. in the D.C.4 M-4.On the other hand, the D.C.4 M-4 is to be equipped with refrigeration, whichhas not so far been developed for the Tudor IV.5. UndercarriageThe Tudor IV has a tail wheel undercarriage with one main wheel only on each side. The D.C.4 M-4 on the other hand has a nose wheel undercarriagewith twin main wheels on each side. The Tudor IV, therefore, requires airfieldswith a slightly longer and rather stronger surface, when operating under com-parable conditions.In general, neither aircraft will be limited on length of runway on Empireroutes.The bearing strength at certain key aerodromes outside United kingdom control on Empire routes (Cairo, Calcutta, Delhi, Karachi and Bahrein) isbelieved to be now only just adequate for the Tudor and to be deteriorating.The difference in the single wheel loading of the two aircraft is therefore likelyto be an important factor.6. Operational ExperienceThere is considerable experience on the D.C.4 M-l and 2 with Trans-CanadaAirlines, although none as yet on the D.C.4 M-^4, which is not fundamentallydifferent. There has been some limited operational experience with the Tudor iVin service with B.S.A.A.The engines and power plants (Merlin) are similar in the two types of aircraft.
