SECRET    -O.P.(ti8)  153 -OPY NO.25TH JUNE.  IQI4-8CABINETCOMPARISON OP WAR PENSIONS WITH THE compensation to BE PAID TO MINERS. UNDER PROPOSED SCHEME OP&quot;SUPPLEMENTARY INJURIES benefits memorandum by the, Minister of pensions in view of the discussion at the meeting of the Cabineton 20th June (C,M.(h.8) h2nd Conclusions, Minute 6) I have thoughtit desirable to submit a paper showing the difference betweenWar pensions and the compensation to be paid to miners and their dependants if approval is given to the Miners&apos; Scheme to be madeunder Section 83 of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)Act.2.     Disabled Men.      At Appendix I are    tables showing thecompensation payable in 100 per cent, disablement cases to miners,other industrial injury oensioners,  and war pensioners where themen are working (Table A)&apos;,  and where they are unemployable and inreceipt of Unemployability Supplement (Table B).3.      Table A shows that the unmarried miner will receive 15/-a week more than the unmarried war pensioner, 5/- a week morethan the married war pensioner and only 2/6d. a week less thanthe war pensioner with a wife and child.h. Such a position is in my opinion indefensible.     Theminers&apos; supplementation is a form of danger money, but the risks of mining are no greater than those of fighting.     Moreover ineffect both ore nationalised industries.5. It would be an intolerable situation if in a miningvillage there were two men pensioned at the 70 per cent,  rate forthe loss of a leg - the one an unmarried miner who lost his legwhile following his regular occupation receiving k-2/- a week - theother a married war pensioner who lost his leg on the battlefieldreceiving 38/6d. a week for himself and his wife.6. I am being pressed by members of all parties to increasewar pension rates and I am under1 particularly strong pressure fromthe British .Legion and the British Limbless Ex-Servicemen&apos;s association who are asking for a 100 per cent, disablement rateof 90/- ana 6l/8d. a week respectively.7. When I took office I had an informal talk with theBritish Legion and I told them quite frankly that I did not intend to recommend an increase in the standard rate of pension, but- thatI felt that something should be done for the man who has to give up work temporarily because he requires treatment or has been forced by his disablement to give up work permanently.      In otherrixIO DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
words I indicated that I would give nothing more to the war -pensioner who is -working but would improve his treatmentallowances and his pension when he. is unemployable.8. The claims of the ex-Servicemen&apos;s Associations weremade long before the Miners&apos; Scheme was contemplated and werebaaed solely on the increased cost of living.      It was argued that the pension of the 100 per cent. 191k: war pensioner had only been increased by 12 per cent,  since 1939? whereas the cost ofliving had gone up by over 30 per cent, and wages by over 70 percent.      Their claims will clearly be pressed with added vigourwhen the Miners&apos; Scheme becomes known.      It will be difficultenough to resist an increase in the&apos; standard rate in view of whatthe miner is to get,  and it will in my opinion be quite impossibleto refuse the war pensioner undergoing treatment or unemployableparity with the miner.      I do not believe that the House,  theex-Serviee community or indeed the general community willtolerate a situation in which the invalid war pensioner is treatedless favourably than the invalid miner,9. One has heard the argument that the Miners&apos; Scheme isa contributory scheme and that the war pensioner,  the whole of whose pension comes from the Exchequer, cannot expect equalcompensation with the miner.     With respect I would say that theMiners&apos; Scheme is not a seriously contributory one.     The mineris only contributing -g- the remaining -g- being contributed by the goal Board, which means by the consumers of coal,  viz.  everybodyin the community,  including the war pensioner who is confined for life to his house, perhaps to his bed,  and who will get a   much lower pension than the miner.10,     Widows,     At Appendix II is a table showing the conditions and rates of pensions payable to&apos; widows of miners, industrial injury widows and war widows eligible for pension at the higher rates.      For purposes of comparison is added the provision for widows under the National Insurance Act.      At Appendix III is asimilar table regarding widows pensioned at the lower rate.11.     Appendix II (Widows eligible for the higher- rates), -   Manycomparisons can be made but the following stand out -(I)    The miners&apos; widow over 50 at her husband&apos;s death will get 20/- a week more than the similar industrial injury widowand 15/- a week more than the war widow.      The similar widowwhose husband died a natural death will get no pension unless she had been married for 10 years.(2)    The miner1s widow with a child will get ll/6d.  a weekmore than a similar war widow whose&apos; rent is not more than 8/- aweek,  and at least 2k/- a week more than the similar widow whosehusband died a natural death.12. For reasons which I need not reiterate I do. not think this -wide differentiation between the treatment of the miner&apos;swidow and the war widow can be defended.13.     Appendix III (Widows eligible for the lower rates).      Theproposal to give a kO/- pension to the young fit- childless miner&apos;swidow is in my opinion monstrous and let me say at once that I donot intend to recommend any increase,in the existing pension of20/- a week for the similar war widow.      The proposal is contraryto Labour principles,  removes the incentive to full work,  and merely creates a privileged class.1U. The under 50 fit, childless miner&apos;s widow will get -
(2)(3)(h)twice as much as the similar industrial injurywidow and twice as much as the similar war widowwho is under l+G;&apos;-5s. a week more thanwidow, who may eventhe hO year old childless war&quot;be an invalid;cs    Uson si on of l+Os.  a week for life as compared &quot;withan allowance of 36s.  a week for 13 weeks for thechildless widow of a man&apos; who dies a natural death..(The latter widow will have to wait until 60 beforsshe gets a  pension and then it will he&apos;only 26s.a week);?s.6d. a weekone child.more than the &apos;civilian&apos; widow withMoreover,thea weekintactthe miner&apos;s widow willwhereasthe &apos; civilian&apos;allowance ofwomen each earn l+Os.have her pensionwidow will have her33s. 6d.  reduced toOS. OG.of 80s. aan incomechild.The miner&apos;s widow will then have an incomeweek for herself, and the &quot;civilian&apos; widowof 63s. 6d.  a week for herself and her15. I take again the mining village where there might  be four childless fit widows in say the early thirties.      Theircompensation will vary as follows,  according to whether the husband was(1)    Killed in the pits      -   l+Os.  a week for life.(h)    Killed in industryother than mining(5)    Killed in action&apos;(k)    Died a natural death --    20s.  a week until 60.then 2os.20s.  a week until 1+0.then 35&apos;36s. forPension13 weeks.of 26s. at 60.16. woman having the care of a miner&apos;s orphan_child.The proposal to supplement by 20s.  the 20s.   payable under theAct would give such a woman h7s.  6d.   a week for herself and the child.      There is no provision in the War Pensions Instrumentsfor the woman who has the care of a war orphan&apos; except where sheJ- -jU.hod lived with the child&apos;s father as his wife.     -The unmdependant who has lived as the wife of a Service man receivespension of 27s. 6d.  a week and an allowance of 11s.  for the child (38s.  6-d.&apos; in all) /together with a rent allowance if herrent exceeds 8s.  a week.a17. The &apos;unmarried dependant&apos;  of- a miner with one childwill therefore get:-(1)    9s. a week more than the similar &apos;unmarrieddependant&apos;  of a Service man whose rent is not,more than 8s.  a week,  and(2)    1s.  6d.  a week more thai the war widow with one child whose rent is not more than 8s.  a week.18. With respect I cannot.see how a Labour Government whospolicy is to equalise compensation for disablement and deathrather than to create bigger differences can possibly.defend theinequalities to which I have drawn attention.
19*&apos; I should be failing in my duty&apos; to the Government and tothe ex-Service community if I did not draw my colleagues&apos;attention to the serious anomalies which will be created if theMiners&apos; Scheme is accepted andnothing is done for the warpensioner.      If this Scheme is approved by the Government Ishall feel bound to suggest improvements in war pensions notonly for the men on treatment or unemployable but also for theworking war pensioner, for the widow who has children or is over lj.0 or is an Invalid and for the unmarried dependant.      Theplan I had In mind for the first two distressing classes wouldhave involved expenditure of something under  ,% million a year.If the latter classes are included by making a moderate increaseof ys.  a week In the standard disablement rate the widow&apos;shigher rate end of 2s.6d.  a week in the pension of the unmarrieddependant, an additional expenditure of something over  5 million a year would be involved.G.
