mr. CHURCHILL, introducing the Deputation, said that their purpose was to present for the favourable consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe Resolutions passed at the Congress of Europe held at The Hague in May1948. This Congress had been attended by people of standing from all the democratic countries of Europe. Although those present attended as individuals,and not in any representative capacity, the meeting could claim to speak on behalfof all the free peoples of Europe.The British Delegation to the Congress had from the outset endeavoured tomaintain the non-Party character of the movement. They did not wish it to intervene in Party politics in any country. It was their object to foster the feeling of unity in western Europe and to bring its inhabitants to regard themselves asgood Europeans. They had no desire to trespass on the functions of executiveGovernments. They recognised that they, as private persons, had no share inthe responsibilities of Governments. They believed, however, that by developing the cultural, moral and intellectual ties between the various countries of western europe they could substantially aid the work of Governments and could, inparticular, assist His Majesty&apos;s Government to achieve the objectives of theirEuropean policy. The victory gained by the British Commonwealth and her allies in the late war would be a mockery unless, through it, the countries ofEurope could be carried forward to unity and lasting peace. This was the fore-most object of European union. It was fully consistent with the objectives ofthe United Nations; for any European Union would be a subordinate and regionalelement in the United Nations organisation.The Deputation wished, in particular, to commend to the favourable consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government the proposal for the constitutionof a European Assembly, chosen by the Parliaments of the participating nations,which would serve as a forum for the expression of ideas and aspirations makingtowards the political and economic union of western Europe. They did not wishto dogmatise about the constitution of this Assembly. They did no more thancommend the idea of such an Assembly to the favourable consideration of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Other national delegations to The Hague Congress weresubmitting the idea to their Governments. They asked that British ministers should consider sympathetically the possibility of giving encouragement and support to the establishment of some form of European Assembly which would serve to mobilise the forces of public opinion in all countries of Europe in supportof the conception of European Union.Mr. MACKAY spoke in support of the Political Resolution passed by theCongress at The Hague. He said that the Congress had been attended by 285Members of Parliament drawn from the sixteen participating countries and from western Germany. These represented all shades of political opinion saveCommunism. The Political Resolution was, therefore, one which carried with it the support of a representative collection of men and women with practical experience of political life. It did not conflict in any way with the views expressedby the Prime Minister in his speech in the debate in the House of Commons on th May. The Union which it recommended would be free from all outsidecontrol and would not be directed against any particular country. He stressed,in particular, the paragraph proposing the early establishment of a european assembly. For some time past there had been a wide measure of agreement onthe principle of European Union : the practical questions now were of timing and method. He believed that the next step should be to arrange for the establish-ment of a European Assembly which could advise on the practical measures required to bring about the economic and political union of Europe and to workout plans for that purpose. He envisaged an Assembly of four or five hundredpeople nominated by the Parliaments of the participating nations. He believedthat this would be the most practical method of mobilising public opinion through-out Europe in support of the conception of European Union. He therefore asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give sympathetic consideration to thispart of the Political Resolution and to take steps to ascertain the views of other european GovernmentsLORD LAYTON spoke in support of the Economic Resolution. This hadbeen the most difficult Resolution, to frame, since it covered a wide range ofdifficult problems on which there was a substantial divergence of view. It was,therefore, remarkable that so large a common measure of agreement had beenfound. It was clear that the world&apos;s economic difficulties called for a revo-revolutionary change in economic policy, and that it was now essential that theindustrial and financial resources of Europe should be developed on a Continentalbasis.   It was not yet clear how far this could be achieved by the Organisation
tat European Economic Co-operation. He thought it important that all european governments should proclaim their determination to achieve the economic unity of Europe. This involved three main implications. First, success could not bethieved without some encroachment on the sovereign rights of individualiountries Secondly, there must be co-ordinated production programmes torfurope as a whole : there must be a common programme and a common plan.Thirdly, there must be co-ordination of social policies, and reciprocal arrange-tients under social service schemes sufficient to ensure full mobility of labour.These aims could not be realised by the action of Governments alone : they alsosquired the full collaboration of the public and the support of both sides ofindustry in all European countries. Finally, it must be recognised that western europe could not alone become a viable economic unit. The economic organisa-tion of a European Union must also include the overseas territories of the participating countries, including the self-governing parts of the BritishCommonwealth.Mr. KENNETH LINDSAY spoke in support of the Cultural Resolution.The British Delegation! to the Congress at The Hague had based themselves on article III of the Treaty of Brussels. They had stressed the diversity ofEuropean culture, which was not the prerogative of any single nation, race ortreed. They looked forward to the establishment of a European Cultural Centrewhich would promote an awareness of European unity through all the media ofinformation. This would undertake for Europe the functions discharged by theBritish Council for the British way of life and by U.N.E.S.C.O. for the worldat large. A cultural movement of this kind would be of great value in creatingadimate of public opinion without which the objectives of British foreign policy could not be achieved. It would provide special opportunities for rallying to theideals of western civilisation the youth of Europe which was now waveringbetween the extremes of political Right and Left. Finally, it would be ofimportance in keeping the flame of political freedom alive in eastern Europe,with which our only remaining links were now commercial and cultural relations.THE PRIME. MINISTER thanked the Deputation for bringing forward the Resolutions of the Congress at The Hague. He was fully in sympathy withthe objectives which the Deputation had in view. He endorsed the importanceof promoting a sense of European unity. His Majesty&apos;s Government were already working along these lines; but he recognised that there was scope for assistance by unofficial agencies in mobilising public opinion in support of the conception of Western Union. He agreed that western Europe could not be economicallyviable without the overseas territories of the participating countries; and Hisilajesty&apos;s Government must take special care to ensure that, in growing towardswestern Europe, the United Kingdom did not move away from the self-governingcountries of the Commonwealth. They must, therefore, consider how far theycould properly go without full discussion with other Commonwealth Governments.He would deprecate the creation of unnecessarily elaborate machinery, or new machinery which would tend to duplicate the work of existing organisations.Thus, he thought that the International Labour Organisation was alreadycompetent to pursue some of the aims of the Economic Resolution. The wisecourse would be to identify the gaps in existing machinery and consider how bestthese might be filled. He was not sure that would be the constitution and functions of the proposed European Assembly. Would its members representthe national Parliaments? And was it contemplated that its resolutions would lie binding on the Governments of the participating countries \ In reply,ife. MACKAY said that it was contemplated that the European Assembly wouldfe sponsored by the national Governments and that its members would beanimated by the national Parliaments. The Assembly would, however, have notowers and no executive functions. Its recommendations would merely beEmitted for consideration by the national Governments. THE PRIMESINISTER said that he would like them to consider this proposal. He was not sure that this more spectacular method was likely to achieve such practical resultsas the method of working on specific projects through organisations like theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation. He would, however, be glad to arrange for detailed consideration to be given to this particular recom-Qendation.,    THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that for a long time past he hadsoped to see the creation of a European Union. After the end of the war, howeverike United Kingdom had no power to support the European economy,&apos; untif the*$er of Marshall Aid gave us the opportunity to take the lead in promoting alaion of western Europe.   Even then, fears for their future security had
prevented some European countries from giving full support to this conception!until recently, when the United States Government had given their assurance!that they intended to retain Armed Forces in Europe until peace was assured!The speeches by M. Bidault and M. Reynaud in the previous day&apos;s debate in the!French National Assembly were encouraging evidence that France was uomIdetermined to give full support to the conception of Western Union Western!Europe could not alone achieve her position in the world; but, with the prospective]tive development of Africa. South-East Asia- and India and with our affiliation!with Middle-Eastern countries, we now had an opportunity to consolidatestrong position in the middle of the world.In advocating- a European Lnion, he would himself be disposed to avoicany reference to the surrender of sovereign rights. He would prefer to proceed by creating conditions in which claims of national sovereignty would not beasserted. Governments could be persuaded to accept commitments which in f aclinvolved some encroachment on sovereign rights, so long as explicit mention oisovereignty was avoided.He doubted whether the establishment of a European Assembly would help to achieve the objectives which the Deputation had in view. He wondered whetheisuch an assembly would be helpful until the national Governments had mad(further progress towards the solution of some of the practical problems involvedThus, such iW Assembly would doubtless advocate free movement between thecountries of western Europe: but the difficidties in the way of this could beunravelled only by the Finance Ministers of the national Governments concerned.Again, defence questions were fundamental to the success of Western Union. would it be possible to&quot; create a single Budget for Western Union defence, each countrycontributing a proportion of its national income? How could these questionsbe profitably discussed in a European Assembly consisting of private individualswith no public responsibilities ? The Resolutions passed at The Hague congress were helpful in creating a favourable climate of public opinion. But he believedthat the common objectives of the Government and the Deputation were more likely to be achieved by the method of practical collaboration between representa-tives of the Governments of the countries of western Europe.Mr. CHURCH i LL thanked the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretaryfor receiving the Deputation. He drew a sharp distinction between the role ofthe unofficial and voluntary organisation which he represented and the functionsof executive Governments: and he stressed the fact that those whom the Deputationrepresented had no desire to usurp the functions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.They did, however, favour the establishment of a European Assembly as a forum for the ventilation of ideas and a means of mobilising public opinion throughout europe in support of the conception of European Union. He did not contemplate any elaborate machinery: he envisaged an Assembly which would meet onceor twice a year to review the progress made and to enlist public support for thepolicy of the national Governments. He did not suggest that resolutions passed at this Assembly should in any way be binding upon national Governments. TheAssembly could not encroach on the executive responsibility of Governments. Thecreation of such an Assembly would also provide a convenient means of bringing]western Germany back into the family of European nations. All that he asked]was that His Majesty&quot;s Government should give their support and assistance]in getting such an Assembly established. He hoped that Ministers would consideijm detail what they could do to this end.As regards sovereignty, he agreed that it was undesirable to ask for the!surrender of sovereign rights. He would prefer to speak in terms of countrielacquiring an enlarged or enriched sovereignty- through membership of a EuropearfUnion. IMs. MACEAY suggested that the Deputation should submit a writteJmemorandum dealing with the possible methods of constituting a european assembly. Mr. CHURCHILL suggested that the Prime Minister might the!delegate to others the duty of discussing this memorandum with selected memberfof the Deputation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if such a memorandum were submitted!he would gladly arrange for it to be examined.The Prime Minister and Mr. Churchill then settled the terms of a Presfcommunique briefly reporting the proceedings at the Deputation.The Deputation withdrew.I7tk June, 1948.
