The Right Hon. George Strauss, M.P.,^        Minister of Supply.Sir,In our Interim Report dated 11th December, 1947, we dealt with thedevelopment and production of the Tudor I aircraft; and in submitting it wesaid that we hoped to submit a further report dealing with other marks ofthe Tudor.The most important of these are the Tudor II, IV and V. We have concentrated our attention on the Tudor II type and this Report deals only with this aircraft. We are not aware of any matters affecting the other markswhich require our examination and we propose to regard the submission ofthis Report as discharging our task. We understand that you concur inthis view.We should like to emphasise that in conducting our enquiry we havenot had before us, as we had in the case of the Tudor I, the results of official trials of the aircraft. Our conclusions about the operational qualities of the aircraft, therefore, have necessarily been based on estimated performancefigures. A Tudor II has now gone to Boscombe Down for official flighttrials and actual figures should be available shortly. These might well modifyour conclusions.At Appendix A we set out the names of those who appeared before us.We also provide in Appendix B a description of the various marks of the tudor type to which we have referred in this Report and in our InterimReport.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,C. L. COURTNEY.JAMES MOULD.J. J. TAYLOR.J. A. Drew (Secretary).R. M. Brown (Assistant Secretary).23rd June, 1948.
ReportHISTORY OF THE TUDOR II AIRCRAFTTechnical History1. The Tudor II, as its name implies, is a derivative of the Tudor I. Whilethe latter was intended to be a long-range aircraft with a necessarily restrictedpayload, the former was to be suitable for medium ranges with a greaterpayload. These two marks of aircraft were designed to have identical wingstail units, under-carriages and power plants; only the fuselage was to different, the Tudor I being thin and short (10 ft. diameter and 80 ft. long)and the Tudor II a little fatter and much longer (11 ft. diameter and 105 ft.long). Thus, for operation over the Empire routes to Australia and SouthAfrica, where airfields could be expected to be available for refuelling at reasonable stages, the Tudor II could, it was hoped, be used with a far more economic payload than the&apos;Tudor I.2. Proposals for the construction of the Tudor II were originally putforward by A. V. Roe, Ltd., in the autumn of 1943. They were knownto the second Brabazon Committee, which reported that while the tentativespecification put forward by the firm approached the requirements of the brabazon 3B(J), it could not be regarded as fulfilling the ultimate requirementsof the type and at the most should be regarded only as an interim type 3B(Report dated 3rd July, 1944). In August they were informed that it was unlikely that capacity could be found to produce the Brabazon 3B, andthat the Ministry of Supply(2) intended to place an order for two prototypesof the Tudor II.3. B.O.A.C. and the Ministry of Civil Aviation were associated with thesepreliminary discussions. In September 1944 the Corporation recommendedthat the Tudor II and/or the D.C.4 with Merlin engines should be considered for services other than the North Atlantic and in the same month theydiscussed the outline of a specification with the Ministry of Supply.4. In November 1944 a draft specification was drawn up which, after further discussion, was agreed with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, B.O.A.C.and- A. V. Roe, Ltd., and was issued in December 1944. The specificationlaid down the following requirements:  Range and payload      ...      ...   2,800 statute miles with a payload of8,275 lb. or 2,600 statute mileswith a payload of 9,675 lb.Cruising speed and heiaht       ...   228 m.p.h. at 25,000 ft.Take-off   ............   Not more than 1,200 yards to 50 ft.in a standard atmosphere at sealevel against a wind speed notexceeding 5 m.p.h.Other requirements were that the fuselage should be pressurised; that the passenger space should be furnished for 41 day passengers; and that the design of the passenger cabin was to be such that it could be made suitable,if required, for the carriage of 22 sleeping passengers. No all-up weight wasspecified as it was in the case of the Tudor I. This allowed the designerfreedom to determine the all-up weight at which the specification could be(*) The type 3B was intended for the longer European services, for the United Kingdom-South Africa route and for medium stage services to New Zealand. The specificationincluded a still air range of 2,250 statute miles at a cruising speed of 230 m.p.h. at 15,000 feet,with a payload of 8,500 lb. and a take-off distance of not more than 1,200 yards to 50 ft.(2) As in our Interim Report we refer throughout to the Ministry of Supply, which hastaken over the functions of the Ministry of Aircraft Production.
met. At the time the specification was issued the designer estimated thatthe requirements could be met at an all-up weight of 76,000 lb.5. The first prototype of the Tudor II flew in March 1946. It was foundto suffer from most of the aerodynamic troubles which had become apparentih the Tudor I, though to a somewhat lesser degree. In July 1946 (afterfour months&apos; - flight trials by the firm as compared with ten months in thecase of the Tudor I) the prototype was taken to Boscombe Down for official^flight trials. This aircraft was in much the same state of aerodynamicdevelopment as the Tudor I when it was first flight tested at Boscombe Downin April 1946. It was returned to the firm in September for furtheraerodynamic improvement and was again sent to Boscombe Down on 7th December, 1946, for trials for a Certificate of Airworthiness.6. These tests were not completed by April 1947 when the aircraft wasreturned to the firm for incorporation of the improvements which it hadbeen decided to make to the Tudor I as a result of the Nairobi trials ofthat aircraft (an account of which was given in our Interim Report).7. The work of adapting these improvements to the Tudor II was well advanced when the aircraft crashed on a trial flight, killing the TechnicalDirector and Chief Test Pilot. This unfortunate accident deprived the firmnot only of the accumulated experience of the two men most closely concernedwith the technical development of the Tudor II, but also of the only aircraftthen available for test flights. The first production aircraft had to be broughtto the point of development which had been reached by the prototype andconsequently the aircraft could not be sent to Boscombe Down for its finaltests for a Certificate of Airworthiness until May 1948.Utilisation of the Aircraft8. We have already noted that the Tudor II was intended for use onthe routes between the United Kingdom and Australia, New Zealand andSouth Africa. The structure of the operating companies arid the degree ofco-operation with the Dominions were undetermined in 1944 and the firstproduction order for 30 Tudor IIs placed in November of that year at therequest of B.O.A.C. was no more than a first instalment.9. In December 1944, however, an Imperial Air Conference accepted theprinciple of parallel operation on the trunk routes between the UnitedKingdom and Australia and between the United Kingdom and South Africa.Under this arrangement, each country would operate its own national line from terminal to terminal, would pool revenue and would use the same typeof aircraft, thus effecting substantial economies in aircraft reserves, stocksof spares and technical maintenance organisation.10. Following this decision, B.O.A.C. prepared detailed schedules of services to be operated by them and by the Commonwealth operators andcalculated that approximately 85 aircraft would be required. At their request the Ministry of Supply in April 1945 increased the order for Tudor IIs from30 to 79; it was intended that the remaining 6 should be produced in Australia,but this proposal was later dropped. The decision that the Tudor II wouldbe used by United Kingdom, Australian and South African operators was confirmed by the Commonwealth Air Transport Operators Committee inJuly 1945.11. Although there was some variation of requirements from time totime, the order for 79 aircraft remained in force until October 1946. Butit was during this period that doubts arose as to whether the Tudor IIwas likely to prove suitable for use on all the Empire routes. The reasonsfor these doubts will be explained later in this report; it will suffice here35470 d*
(3) See Appendix B.to say that estimates of the weight of the aircraft grew greater and thatestimates of performance, in terms of range and payload and of take-off,began to decline.12. At this time also, foreign competitors were beginning to equipthemselves with proven American types and information of this kind coupled with discouraging reports of the Tudor, both in respect of performance andof deliveries, began to influence the Dominions. In July 1946, Qantas EmpireAirways, the Australian Company, reached the conclusion that they mi1&quot;take an option on four Constellations and shortly afterwards South Africa-Airways announced that they proposed to use Skymasters.13. These decisions, which involved the loss of most of the advantagesexpected from parallel operation, were taken only after the fullest consulta-tion between the companies and Governments concerned, both here and inthe Dominions. Even had the aircraft been available, however, they, wouldnot have been used for through operation as had originally been contemplated,since by October 1946 B.O.A.C. had concluded that the Tudor II could notbe operated east of Calcutta nor south of Nairobi due to the limitations oftake-off from existing airfields. The Corporation therefore proposed to limitits use to routes west and north of these points respectively and to WestAfrica.14. The consequence of these decisions by the Commonwealth operatorsand by B.O.A.C. led to a recommendation in October 1946 that the order forTudor IIs should be reduced from 79 to 50; this was put into effect inJanuary 1947. Of this latter figure 26 were calculated to be required for.O.A.C. services, 6 (in the form of the Tudor V(3)) for B.S.A.A. services,while the remaining 18 were earmarked for fitting with Hercules engines if trialswith this installation should show an improvement in performance.15. Relatively little production work has been carried out on the Tudor IIsince February 1947, partly because it has been decided that the results offurther development of the Tudor I since the Nairobi trials of that aircraft should be applied to the Tudor II, and partly because of uncertainty whetherB.O.A.C. will ultimately accept the aircraft for operation.THE COURSE OF THE ENQUIRY16. Our examination of the course of development of the Tudor Inecessarily involved some consideration of the delays which have occurred inthe production of the aircraft and its introduction into service. There were also serious delays in the production of the Tudor II, but in our view these are less important than the question of the suitability of the aircraft for its intendedpurpose, both by reference to the specification and by comparison with theexisting types of aircraft, notably the York, which it will replace if it is brought into service. Accordingly it is to this latter subject that we have felt it right to devote the major part of our enquiry.17. In the course of development there has been a substantial increasein the size of the fuselage. This increase was partly occasioned by alterationsmade to internal layout and has contributed to the rise in weight of the aircraft.The increased weight in its turn has affected performance. It will be con-venient, therefore, to deal with layout, size, weight and performance in that order.INTERNAL LAYOUT    .18. In our Interim Report we stated that the development of the Tudor Ihad been delayed by a number of aerodynamic defects.  The same defects were
present in the Tudor II, though to a lesser degree, and their solution has had to await the results of the extended investigations made into the troubles of the tudor I. Thus, the delaying effect of the modifications required by B.O.A.C.is less than it would have been in other circumstances, since time was avail-able, due to the slowness with which the aerodynamic development proceeded,to deal with these changes.7&apos;hu Requirements of the Operators*** 19. Broadly the only major alterations special to the Tudor II are thoseconcerning the internal layout and in this part of our report we propose to concentrate on the effect on the aircraft of these changes and the modificationsresulting from them.20. The story of these changes is a complicated one, because until the summer of 1946 it was necessary for B.O.A.C. to co-ordinate their own requirements with those of the Commonwealth operators, for whom theywere acting; the changes were therefore partly the result of the varying opinions of these operators.21. It was originally decided by B.O.A.C. in consultation with theCommonwealth operators (and included in the specification) that all the air-craft should be equipped with * convertible day and night accommodation.This decision was based on the principle that journeys involving more than one night in the air would necessitate sleeping accommodation and that a surchargewould be attracted. Seats were therefore to be arranged in facing pairswhich were easily convertible into half the number of bunks. This arrange-ment, convenient though it was, had two important results; it necessitatedfirst an increase of 2 ft. in the length of the fuselage and secondly an increasein weight due to the convertible seat/bunk arrangement.22. In May 1945, as a result of a further study, B.O.A.C. decided thaton certain routes, because of limited time in the air, sleeper accommodation would not be justified, and that in consequence a day seater or &quot; Pullman &quot;version would also be necessary. They further decided that this Pullmanversion was now to have priority, since their studies had shown that &quot; nomixture of sleeping and sitting passengers could absorb the payload whichwould be available on representative Empire route sectors &quot;; the first 20 air-craft were to be produced in this version. These alternative layouts werepartly responsible for a further increase in fuselage length.23. In July 1945 there was yet another change in layout arrangements.In that month meetings were held by B.O.A.C. with the Commonwealthoperators from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India and as aresult it was agreed that priority should once more revert to the convertibleday and night version.24. In August and September 1945, a mock-up of the sleeper version wasinspected and various alterations were called for by B.O.A.C. It was urged by the firm that these changes would seriously delay the production of theaircraft but the Ministry of Civil Aviation stated that the delay was acceptableand that no further modifications would be put forward.^ .25. Unfortunately this latter undertaking was not carried into effect.For instance, in October 1945 a new colour scheme and a rearrangement ofthe layout of the dressing rooms were proposed by an industrial designerintroduced by B.O.A.C. The former requirement entailed the purchase ofnew materials in the delivery of which there was a six months&apos; delay. Again,in December 1945, B.O.A.C. put forward a request for a new type of chair&apos;convertible into a bunk, which had to be designed, developed and approvedbefore production could be carried further. In the result it was not until35470 D* 2
August 1945 that a completed rear half of a fuselage could be submitted forthe inspection of B.O.A.C.26. This fuselage section was later incorporated in a complete aircraft(the Tudor VII) and arrangements were made for an inspection to be held inDecember 1946. B.O.A.C. examined the aircraft but did not attend theconference, on the ground that the interior of the aircraft was not completelyfurnished.27. It will be seen that work had gone on throughout 1946 on tferequirements put forward by B.O.A.C. and the Commonwealth operator,notwithstanding that in July Qantas Empire Airways ceased to be interestedin the Tudor and that in the autumn South African Airways also decided not to operate it. It was not until February 1947 that B.O.A.C. indicated that only six aircraft were required in the sleeper version; this involved thescrapping of a considerable quantity of parts and materials peculiar to thatversion. No decision was, however, given as to the detailed requirements to which the remainder Should be produced. The Corporation have statedthat rather than make yet another change in the layout of the aircraft byreverting to the arrangements decided upon before the entry on the scene of the Commonwealth operators, they decided to accept the aircraft withthe convertible accommodation. While we appreciate the Corporation^ desirenot to impose further burdens on the constructor, we feel that they missedthe opportunity of making a substantial saving in the weight of the aircraft by abandoning the heavy convertible arrangement and adopting a light weightseat for day use.Financial Responsibility for the Modifications28. A further considerable delay arose from the failure adequately to define financial responsibility for modifications and this came to a head inJuly 1947 at a meeting of the Civil Aircraft Modifications Committee.29. A. V. Roe, Ltd., had proceeded with the alterations to the sleeperversion requested by B.O.A.C. during their inspections of the mock-up, whichhad resulted in some 340 requirements, but B.O.A.C. were not prepared to commit themselves to paying for the redundant material arising from thesemodifications because they had not formally accepted the Tudor II type.The Ministry of Civil Aviation for their part did not feel able to authoriseexpenditure on work peculiar to B.O.A.G.&apos;s requirements without an assurance that they would ultimately take over the aircraft and pay the full cost,including all modifications. The Civil Aircraft Modifications committee therefore placed a number of modifications in abeyance pending agreement about financial responsibility, and at subsequent meetings they restricted theirauthorisation of modifications to those essential for airworthiness. Thisdecision prevented the completion of the interior accommodation in the first six aircraft, while work on the seventh and subsequent aircraft was limited by the lack of a decision as to whether they should be built in the new dayversion which B.O.A.C. had asked the firm to investigate. Little progress was made on the Tudor II during the remainder of 1947.30. In October 1947 B.O.A.C. stated that before reaching a decision onthe Tudor II type they wished to inspect a complete aircraft in order toexamine the interior layout, the Merlin engine installation, the under-floorcargo holds and other features all together. On the other hand they did not commit themselves to operation of the aircraft even if the layout provedacceptable, and the Ministry of Civil Aviation were not prepared to riskexpenditure which might prove to be nugatory. The deadlock was finallybroken in January 1948, when the Ministry of Supply assumed responsibility for
authorising the work necessary to bring the first production aircraft up to thefull B.O.A.C. modification standard for examination by the Corporation. Atthe same time a trial installation of the new day accommodation in anotherTudor II was authorised by the Ministry of Supply.31. The result of all this is that a considerable amount of work still remains to be done before the aircraft can be assembled, and this may resultin delay additional to that caused by the incorporation of the aerodynamicmodifications. This situation is, in our opinion, primarily due to a failure to^ermine in good time financial responsibility for the project as a whole andparticularly for the alterations required by B.O.A.C. We do not infer that thesolution of the difficulty would have been easy, but the situation we have described demonstrates the importance of it(*j32. B.O.A.C. have sought to justify their action in making successivechanges in layout on the ground that many of them were required by theCommonwealth operators. This is, of course, true but some of the changesasked for represented second thoughts by B.O.A.C. on their own requirements and we feel that we cannot acquit them of vacillation which must have addedmaterially to the load on the firm&apos;s design and development staffs, and nodoubt contributed its quota to the strained relations between the parties towhich we have referred in our Interim Report.THE SIZE OF THE AIRCRAFT33. As originally conceived in December 1943 the fuselage had an overalllength of 95 ft. with a maximum diameter of 10\ ft. In its final stage ofdevelopment the fuselage is approximately 105  ft. long with a maximumdiameter of 11 ft. The dimensions and surface area of the main planes have remained constant. Several witnesses have told us that the most strikingfeature of the Tudor II, in their view, is the very large size of the fuselagein relation to other dimensions. By comparison, the fuselage length of theSkymaster, which is being used by South African Airways on some of theroutes which the Tudor II was intended to operate, is 10^ ft. shorter than the tudor II, while its fuselage diameter and wing area are almost identical withthose of the Tudor II and the all-up weights of the two types are now thesame.34. Like the Tudor I, the Tudor II moved further and further away fromthe designers original conception as successive changes v/ere made. It is acommonly expressed view that, as the result of these changes, the Tudor II has developed into an aircraft having a volumetric capacity much greater than that required for the load it is able to carry on the Empire routes. Proposals havebeen made to increase the operational payload by fitting higher-poweredengines or by using some other device but these are at best expedients whichmight have been unnecessary but for the departure of the design from theoriginal conception.35. In recording this view, we realise that the aircraft has not yet been subjected to full performance trials and that no final opinion can be expresseduntil these have been completed. Nevertheless, the increases in fuselagedimensions are sufficiently impressive to warrant an examination of the reasonsfor them.36. In September 1944 the length was increased by 2\ ft. and the diameterby 6 inches, following discussions with B.O.A.C. on passenger cabin dimen-sions; in November 1944 a further 2 ft. were added to the length to admit of(4) The remarks in paragraph 90 of our Interim Report on the Tudor I may be taken as applying also to the Tudor II. &apos;
THE WEIGHT OF THE aircraft the Increases in Weight38. All these increases in the size of the fuselage contributed to theincrease in the all-up weight of the Tudor II. Although this weight increase is no greater than that of the Tudor I, its effect on performance, and par-ticularly on take-off, is more critical in the case of the Tudor II because ofairfield limitations on the routes on which it was intended^ to operate. If itshould be found that the performance of the aircraft, in range, payload, or take-off characteristics, does not come up to the expectations of those whoshared in its conception, the primary responsibility must be borne by this weightincrease. We have therefore been at some pains to enquire into the reasonsfor the increases and into the efforts, or lack of them, made to restrict the weight.39. As originally conceived in December 1943 the Tudor II was to havea tare(&apos;&apos;) weight of 44,810 lb. The latest estimate of its weight (February 1948)is 55,417 lb., representing an increase of nearly 24 per cent. This comparison,however, may not be entirely fair, since early discussions of requirementsbetween the interested parties led in December 1944 to the formulation of an agreed specification which was related to a tare weight of 47,765 lb. If this be compared with the tare weight to-day, the difference will be found to be ,652 lb. or 16 per cent. This figure may be broken down as follows : lb.Structure.........      .........      -f-3,298Power plant and tanksEquipmentPressurisation     ...Furnishings        ...-1-1,3224-1,680-1- 58-t-1,2944-7,65240. The increase in structure weight, though partly attributable to altera-tions derived from those made to improve the aerodynamic characteristics ofthe Tudor I, is principally due to an increase in the weight of the fuselage(2,258 lb.). V/e have already referred to the increases in the dimensions ofthe fuselage; these were responsible for perhaps 340 lb. of the increase. Weare informed that a further 900 lb. were due to the particular requirements of.O.A.C. for an under-fioor cargo hold, for associated changes in structure in the vicinity of these holds and for a change from round to square windows.It is also agreed by the constructors that there was a substantial degree of under-estimation of the weight of the fuselage which may partly have been due(s) the tare weight may be defined as the gross Weight less payioad, fuel, oil andthe convertible seat-biink arrangement desired by the operators. Thus, by thetime the specification had been agreed in December 1944, the fuselage had become 99  ft. long and 11 ft. in diameter. A further increase of 3 ft which did not, however, affect cabin dimensions was made for aerodynamic reasonsearly in 1945, and a final increase Of yet another 3 ft. was made in May 1945,partly in order to give flexibility in cabin lay-out and partly to provide an adjustment in the position of the centre of gravity.37.   Whilst it might be contended that the requirements of the operatorswere responsible for a substantial part of the increase in fuselage size, it.to be noted that there is no direct evidence that the designers, as might havebeen expected, opposed the suggestions made by the Corporation.
to lack of experience in the design of circular section structures, and partly to lack of appreciation of the weight of structure needed to meet the civilairworthiness requirements laid down by the Air Registration Board. Weconclude that the remaining 1,020 lb. of increase in fuselage weight was dueto these causes.41.   We have already dealt with the changes in interior layout and furnish-ings.   Of the remaining two important sources of increase of weight listedabove, namely, equipment and power plant and tanks, the first is due to al&amp;imber of factors, e.g., changes in the operators&apos; requirements for instruments,^creases in the amount of de-icing fluid, electrical wiring, &amp;c, required as thefuselage dimensions grew, and initial under-estimation of weight.42. As regards the power plant and tanks, the firm&apos;s early weight estimates were based on the use of the Merlin Mark 100, a. military type engine, but thepower plant now fitted is the later and more reliable civil version known as the621. A set of these is now estimated to be some 1,550 lb. heavier than a set of Merlin Mark 100 power plants. There has, however, been some com-pensatory saving in the weight of the fuel and oil tanks, owing mainly to anagreement in November 1945 to delete the centre section tank, retainingprovision for its fitment if required.Efforts to Save Weight43. The increases in weight began to cause anxiety at an early stage inthe aircraft&apos;s history. When the specification was drawn up in November 1944it was expected that the gross weight would be 76,000 lb. In the autumn of1945, some ten months later, it was reported that the gross weight was likely to exceed 80,000 lb., and a conference was held in November 1945 to considera number of weight saving proposals. This conference had before it sugges-tions by the firm which, if accepted, would have saved some 4,000 lb., thusbringing the gross weight back to its original figure; in the outcome, however,the agreed saving was less than 2,000 lb.44. The conference is of interest for another reason. Amongst theproposals considered were a number which affected passenger amenities andother commercial facilities. None of these was agreed to by the Corporation^representatives. Moreover, during the months which followed the gross weightagain crept up to 80,000 lb. The Corporation, though professedly anxious about the possible effects of excessive weight, deprecated on a number of occasions any proposal to improve matters by economising in the standards of furnishing.45. We have investigated in detail certain examples where it appeared that concessions might well have been made by the Corporation as a contribu-tion to the saving in weight which all parties should have been desirous of effecting. One such example concerns the use of freight spaces under the floor of the cabin which necessitated hatches involving an additional weightof 350 lb. The design had allowed for 540 cubic feet of freight space above the floor, but the Corporation insisted on the provision of a further 250 cubicfeet below the floor, and declined to forgo it in order to save weight.46. We were told that this large total of cargo space, which, if- used,would have contained between 8,000 and 8,500 lb. of cargo, was required on occasions when the passenger demand would fall off due to seasonal fluctua-tions. We cannot consider it reasonable to demand cargo space sufficientto absorb about 90 per cent, of the maximum specified pay load.47. Another example is that of the windows in the passenger cabin. Theywere originally designed to be circular, but the Corporation insisted on anoblong shape so as to give a better view for passengers.  Asked at the weight
saving conference in Nove-rfoer 1945 to agree to a reversion to circular windowsin order to save 145 Bjl, the Corporation declined. While it is doubtlessindisputable that dbloisg windows are more attractive to passengers, there doesnot seem to have baaa a reahssrkKi of the urgent need for saving all possibleweight in the interests of the performance of the&apos; aircraft.48. Although B.OA.C declined to agree to weight savings at the expenseof passenger amenities, they did agree to a reduction in the range andpayload requirements below those in the specification. At the weight savingconference they agreed to proposals which would have the effect of reducin&quot;&quot;the payload-range characteristics to 9,455 lb. of payload for a still air range of 2,130 miles as against the specification requirement of 8,275 lb. for ,800 miles or 9,675 lb. for 2.600 miles.49. In the spring of 1946, the Corporation were engaged in a review ofthe revised weight data, osse of the objects of which was to see whether the previously staled range requirements could be reduced with a consequentsaving in fuel load. Has review was completed in June 1946 and showed that reduction was not feasible- Faced with this conclusion the Corporationmight have been expected Immediately to set about investigating thepossibilities of saving weight in interior accommodation equipment which theyhad hitherto declined to oossider. No such step was taken nor have we beengiven a satisfactory reason for this omission.50. With these facts ia mind. It is significant that a year later in July 1947when a change of management took place, economies in furnishing amountingto over 2,000 lb. were agreed. No decision to alter the furnishing arrange-ments as a result of &amp;as agreement was, however, taken, and the estimate oftare weight made in February I94S (see paragraph 39) makes no allowance for a reduction in famishing weight. If the agreement reached in July 1947were now to be put into effect, the all-up weight of the aircraft could bereduced to 78,000 lb., or alternatively 2,000 lb. more useful load could becarried with the all-up weight remaining at 80,000 lb.THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AIRCRAFT51. It now remains to examine the probable effect of the weight increaseupon the performance of the aircraft. The earliest evidence of concern withthe effect on performance is a statement prepared in the Ministry of Supplydated 22nd October, 1945, following the receipt from A. V. Roe, Ltd., ofinformation that The tare would, in the absence of reductions, exceed the previous estimate by over 4.000 lb. Copies of this statement were sentto the Ministry of Civil Aviation, B.O.A-C. and A. V. Roe, Ltd. The con-clusions were that even if the gross weight were to creep up to 82,000 lb. theAir Registration Board climb-away requirements would be satisfied, but the range-payload characteristics would deteriorate progressively so that at80,235 lb. the paylo3d carried over the specification still-air range of 2,600 mileswould be .7,840 lb. instil of the required 9,675 lb. It is noteworthy that inthese conclusions there was no reference to take-off distance although theestimate in the body of tie report was that take-off to 50 ft. at a gross weightof 80,235 lb. would be 2,180 yards.52. A number of Data Sheets was also issued by the Ministry of Supply.The first dated 2nd Almost, 1945. assumes a gross weight of 76,000 lb. andis therefore not now of much value. The second, dated 26th February, 1946,assumes a gross weight of 77,000 lb. and it was not until 13th May, 1946,that a Data Sheet was issued showing a gross weight of 80,000 lb. Thisestimated a payload of 7,910 lb. (1,765 lb. less than specification) for a range of 2,600 miles and a take-oii distance of 1,700 yards to 50 ft. using the civil
take-off technique (see paragraph 56). This distance would correspond to nearly 3,000 yards under conditions of height and temperature at Nairobi.53. B.O.A.C. themselves did some calculations in May 1946 which con-eluded that in extreme conditions the maximum take-off run at Nairobi mightbe as much as 3,230 yards. The Corporation knew that the maximum runway-length at Nairobi was 2,000 yards and we should therefore have expected tosee great efforts to reduce weight so that the operation of the aircraft mightnot be unduly limited. . -54. We have been informed by representatives of the Ministry of Supplythat the performance set out in the specification was regarded as being in thenature of a target, and that the many subsequent instructions to the firmgiven or agreed to by the Ministry of Supply had the practical effect of altering the specification even though no formal amendments to it were issued. It is evident that as work progressed none of those concerned regarded the achievement of the specification as the sine qua non of acceptance, andin fact very little attention seems to have been paid to it. This is not surprising in view of the fact that when the specification was drawn up littlewas known about the design and construction of post-war civil aircraft, andeven less about the actual conditions in which they would have to operate;consequently the specification was written in very broad terms.55. This can be illustrated by reference to the specified take-off require-ments of 1,200 yards to a 50 ft. screen. In December 1944 there was no agreedstandard for civil take-off, and the specification defined the requirement interms of the &quot; classic &quot; military technique, giving the shortest possible distancein which a height of 50 ft. could be attained from rest. Knowledge of con-ditions on the Empire routes was also incomplete (for example, some air-fields in the Far East were in Japanese hands), but it was known that runwaysof 2,000 yards were in general use and it was thought that even where run-ways of this length did not exist the trend of post-war development wouldrequire them to be laid down.56. As events have turned out, a new civil take-off technique has beenestablished which is designed to ensure that, in the event of an engine failingat any moment during take-off, the aircraft can either climb away safely orbe brought to rest within the runway length. This technique involves a substantially greater run than the &quot; classic &quot; military technique.(6) Moreover,it was found when surveys of the Australian, Far Eastern and South Africanroutes were undertaken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation survey teams that many airfields on the routes did not in fact meet the proposed I.C.A.O.standards for Class C aerodromes which had been accepted as suitable forthe Tudor II.(7).57. In the following section we deal with the reviews made by the Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee of the performance of the Tudor II in relation to the particular routes on which it was intendedto operate, and with the effects of these reviews on the proposed composition of B.O.A.C.&apos;s fleet of aircraft for the Empire services. The Committee&apos;discussions also provide a conspectus of the way in which opinions of the(&apos;) It has been estimated by Boscombe Down that the Tudor II will require a run ofabout 1,850 yards to a 50 feet screen, using the civil technique, to which, of course, additionsmust be made for the temperatures and altitudes to be met with on the Empire routes. in assessing the value of these figures it must be borne in mind that so far no really accuratemeans of estimating the take-off of an aircraft has been devised and that takeoff tests on a fully modified Tudor II have not yet been made.(7) This I.C. A.O. standard provided for runways of 5,900 ft. under conditions of standardtemperature and altitude.
Tudor II were developing throughout 1946-the critical year of its develop-ment.THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL CIVIL AIRCRAFT requirements committee AND THE AIRCRAFT58. The Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee wasappointed by the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Civil Aviation in1946 to review the civil aircraft position and to prepare recommendations folshort-term and long-term programmes. Its membership originally includedrepresentatives of the two Departments and the Corporations under theChairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation;Treasury representation was added later. The aircraft constructors are not represented.59. In the meetings leading up to the Committee&apos;s interim report ofJuly 1946, no doubts were expressed about the qualities of the Tudor JJ,although af the first meeting B.O.A.C. had expressed some reservations about its suitability for the South African route. It was, however, recognised that unless the aircraft became available by 1947 the Corporation might find themselves in a difficult position on the Empire routes because of lack of aircraft which could hold their own until the Brabazon III or the Hermescame into service. Another important factor which weighed with the Com-mittee was the preservation of the arrangements for parallel working withthe Commonwealth operators, and this, as has been explained, depended onthe success of the Tudor II.60. Thus, in July 1946, when the Committee made their interim report,the general view was that there was, at the least, no reason to doubt theultimate success of the aircraft, but that if it failed to come up to expectationsas regards both performance and delivery date, the Commonwealth operatorswould probably purchase United States types and B.O.A.C.&apos;s prospects onthe Empire routes would be seriously affected, since the advantages of paralleloperation using a common type aircraft would be lost and B.O.A.C. wouldhave to operate interim British types in competition with the Commonwealthoperators&apos; more economic American types.61. It was realised early in 1946 that the adequacy of the airfieldsavailable on the Empire routes would materially affect the effective operationof the Tudor II. Accordingly, survey parties were sent out by the Ministryof Civil Aviation and plans were drawn up in consultation with the treasury for the extension of various airfields in territories under British control. Itsoon became clear, however, that there would be little or no advantage in operating the Tudor II on the further stages of the Empire routes, partly because other Governments were unwilling to undertake large extensions torunways at airfields under their sovereignty, and partly because the range ofthe aircraft was inadequate for the further stages; but at this date there wasno suggestion that there would be any difficulty in providing adequate facilities on the nearer stages.62. While these surveys were going on the I.C.A.R. Committee were considering what might be done to improve the performance and particularly the take-off characteristics of the Tudor II. These enquiries centred aroundalternative power plant installations, but the matter was complicated by thepresence in the aircraft programme of the Hermes. By October 1946 theconclusion was reached that if the Tudor II were fitted with Hercules enginesthere would be little to choose between it and the Hermes IV (also fitted withHercules engines), but as the Tudor II so fitted could come forward rather
earlier than the other (probably by October 1948) it would be better to placereliance on the Tudor II. By this time, however, the Australian and SouthAfrican Governments had decided to abandon the Tudor II, and B.O.A.C. had stated that in their view the Tudor II would&apos; be satisfactory for services to India,Egypt and West Africa, but not for operating south of Nairobi and east ofCalcutta. The Committee accordingly recommended (a) that the Tudor IIwith Hercules engines should be pressed forward, (b) that 26 Tudor II air-craft fitted with Merlin engines should be allocated to B.O.A.C.(8) and 18 heldgjgp reserve for installation Of Hercules engines if that proposition should prove^to be worth while. The Ministry of Supply were to negotiate the reductionof the Tudor II order by 29 to a total of 50; it was hoped that A. V. Roe, Ltd.,might take these aircraft over for commercial sale, but in the event they werecanceUed.63. There is no evidence that during this period any serious doubts were expressed as to the desirability of operating the Tudor II, although it was becoming clear that its economic qualities were not likely to be so good ashad originally been hoped. Indeed, on the contrary, as late as November1946 the priority for delivery of the first production aircraft as betweenB.O.A.C., B.S.A.A. and export requirements was being disputed.64. It is difficult to form a true picture of the Committee&apos;s attitude to the tudor II without considering the relationship of the aircraft to its probablesuccessors. In the early discussions in 1946 it had been thought that the tudor II would come into service early in 1947 and would suffice, with theSolent flying boats, to operate the Empire routes. After 1947 the positionwould be more critical and to meet B.O.A.C&apos;s desire to switch over, asconvenient, from the Tudor II to the Hermes IV it was recommended inNovember 1946 that 25 Hermes IV aircraft should also be ordered.65. In the following months it became increasingly clear that even onthe shorter routes it would be difficult to ensure that the programme ofairfield development would keep pace with the production programme forthe aircraft. Not all the airfields at which improvements were required werein British territory and even in these cases difficulties were being experienced in pushing the work on with the requisite speed. Where the airfields werein foreign territory protracted negotiations were necessary and there couldbe no certainty that it would be possible to secure the necessary improvements,which in most cases were not required by other operators. 166. This situation tended to favour the Hermes. The use of both the tudor and the Hermes depended on the programme of airfield development;but since the Hermes was the later type there was a distinct possibility thatthe timetable of airfield development would approximate more closely to thedevelopment of this aircraft than to that of the Tudor II.67. By the spring of 1947, therefore, it was clear that the value of the tudor was likely to be prejudiced by the lack of suitable airfields, even onthe shorter routes to Calcutta, Nairobi, and possibly to West Africa. Butthe Hermes, although more favourably placed from this point of view, wasnot far advanced and its eventual success could not be foretold with certainty.68. Despite increasing doubts about the prospects of the Tudor II theCommittee as a whole had decided in March 1947 that the Tudor projectmust go on. The Chairman, however, felt that the situation was so serious that some alternative to the Tudor and the Hermes would have to be soughtif B.O.A.C. were to be able to hold their position on the Empire routes until such types as the D.H. 106 came into service.   He accordingly put forward(8) A further 6 aircraft (Tudor Vs) were allocated to B.S.A.A.
a proposal under which United States Constellation aircraft would be purchasedand re-engined with the Bristol Centaurus engine. The combination ofUnited States airframe and British engines would, it was thought, show great advantage as against the same airframe when powered with United StatesWright engines, and would provide B.O.A.C. with a corresponding advantage over their competitors. The proposal was, however, rejected by the Govern-ment. This decision in effect reaffirmed the &quot; Fly British&quot; principle andrestored the Tudor and the Hermes to their original status as the interimtypes which would have to be used, whatever their drawbacks, until newer ^and more economic types became available.THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF THE AIRCRAFT69. In attempting to assess the effects of weight increases and other factors on the performance of the Tudor II, we have been handicapped by several difficulties: the absence of any firm performance requirements to takethe place of the specification requirements, which became out of date asknowledge&apos; of actual operating conditions on the Empire routes increased;the absence of performance data based on actual trials of the Tudor II in itspresent form; and the fact that we could not consult the designer of the tudor II, Mr. Roy Chadwick, who was killed in August 1947, and who alonecould have helped us on several important matters.70. As we have seen, the specification was not related to the probablestages and airfield conditions on the routes over which the Tudor II was intended to operate. Little was known in 1944 on these subjects, but as more information became available the Tudor II began to be considered in relationto the actual route requirements rather than to the performance set down inthe specification. In spite of the fact that throughout 1946 B.O.A.C. were making assessments of the performance of the aircraft on various routes, theydid not at any time formulate a set of performance requirements to which theconstructors and others concerned could work, and we thus have no yard-stick by which to measure the estimated performance of the Tudor II to-day.71. In the absence of such a yardstick the designers naturally assumed that they were doing all that was required of them by meeting B.O.A.C.&apos;s requirements for internal layout, &amp;c, and by notifying the Corporation andothers concerned of any resulting effects on performance. It was primarily for B.O.A.C. to relate the firm&apos;s performance data to the operating conditions on the routes, of which they alone had full knowledge, and to keep the primary objective of satisfactory performance in the forefront of everyone&apos;mind. Since the Corporation did not do this on their own initiative, theMinistry&apos; of Civil Aviation, on whose behalf the aircraft were ordered by theMinistry&apos; of Supply, should have pressed them to do so, and the two Govern-ment Departments should have ensured that performance requirementsrelated to the actual routes over which the Tudor II was to operate weretransmitted to the firm.72. The Tudor II prototype incorporating the improvements introduced as the result of the Nairobi trials of the Tudor I in the winter Of 1946-47 has only recently been sent to Boscombe Down, and at the present time there areno measured figures from which to assess the performance of the Tudor II onthe Empire routes. On the basis of the estimated figures at present available the aircraft cannot be operated with an economic payload on routes east ofCalcutta and south of Nairobi under the operating conditions at presentpostulated by B.O.A.C.73. We understand that the standard of operation upon which B.O.A.Cinsist for the Tudor II is very much more stringent than that in force for the
THE FUTURE OF THE AIRCRAFT77. Two views are current about the future of the Tudor II. On theone hand it is contended that, apart from any question of its operationalYork. The latter type has been operating right through to South Africaalthough its take-off performance is not as good as the Tudor&apos;s, and if.O.A.C. were prepared to modify their requirements in respect of the Tudorto some extent, e.g., by arranging for it to take off in the cool of the day fromhigh altitude airfields in hot climates, the Tudor II might well be. capable of use on the Australian and South African routes and would in any case showan improvement over the York, to which, of course, it is superior in passenger-carrying capacity and comfort.V 74. On the assumptions at present made as regards both operating con-ditions and estimated performance, however, it appears that the Tudor II offersfar less improvement over the York in performance and hence in operationaleconomics than was originally expected. It is thus difficult to justify theoperation of the Tudor II east of Calcutta on the Australian route and southof Nairobi on the South African route; on the former because of lack of rangeto fly the critical stage between Singapore and Darwin and on the latter for lack of adequate airfields. The aircraft is, however, superior in performanceto the York on routes west of Calcutta and north of Nairobi and to WestAfrica. The deterioration in the estimated performance of the Tudor II mustbe ascribed primarily to the considerable increase in the tare weight of theaircraft over that originally projected, while the fact that the airfield develop-ment which it was hoped to accomplish in time for Tudor II operations has sofar failed to materialise has also played its part in restricting the field ofusefulness of the aircraft.75. We have seen that the increase in tare weight was due partly to under-estimation of structure weight on the part of the designers and partly toprogressive increases in weight, some of which were the result of the operators insistence in certain standards of passenger and freight accommoda-tion. A. V. Roe, Ltd., take some credit for doing their utmost to meet these requirements, but we cannot escape the conclusion that a more strenuousresistance to alterations which would have the effect of increasing weight andthus diminishing performance would have been in the ultimate interests ofboth parties. Had they taken greater precautions to see that all the parties concerned were aware of the performance penalties involved, A. V. Roe, Ltd.,would have had greater justification for assuming that those penalties were acceptable. We should have liked to have had Mr. Chadwick&apos;s evidence onthis point and related matters, but since many of the discussions were con-ducted orally between Mr. Chadwick and the other parties, written recordsfrom which we might have been able to establish his opinions and actions areunfortunately lacking.76. It is clear, however, that whatever may have been the attitude of thedesigners to those of the B.O.A.C. proposals which had the effect of increasingthe size and weight of the fuselage, B.O.A.C., for their part, were unwilling to make concessions. They were repeatedly pressed to agree to weight saving on furnishings, &amp;c, and frequently declared that they would tolerate nolowering of the standards of passenger accommodation. This attitude wasinimical to the success of the project and indicated a lack of co-co-ordination between those in the Corporation concerned with the commercial aspects ofthe Tudor n, such as standards of passenger accommodation, and those responsible for assessing the operational performance of the aircraft and itsmethod of operation.
quality, the aircraft has fallen so far behind schedule that most of theadvantages which would have resulted from its operation have now vanished.Thus, the Australian and South African operators have equipped themselves with United States aircraft and the original plan of parallel operation of theEmpire routes with B.O.A.C. is no longer feasible. Moreover, it is possiblethat the period of service of the aircraft may extend for only some eighteen months before it is replaqed by the Hermes.78. It is also pointed out that to bring the aircraft into service will involveproblems of training, supply of spares and technical maintenance, all of whichVwill occasion expense in addition to the capital cost of yet another type inaddition to the four to which B.O.A.C. are already committed, viz., theSolent, the Tudor IVB,(9) the Hermes and a new medium-range Empire type.It is stated that all experience of airline operation shows the severe difficulties inherent in frequent changes of major equipment.79. Apart from the difficulty and cost of introducing the Tudor II, it isurged that its operation would involve B.O.A.C. in a heavy deficit even ifexisting fares and rates remain at their present level and do not decline. Itis accordingly suggested that by excluding the Tudor II from service andconcentrating on as few types as possible, the Corporation would be in a better position to reduce their operational deficit on the Empire routes to a minimum.80. The opposing point of view is based on the following considera-tions:  (a) It would be a deplorable waste of effort and material to cancel the tudor II contract now that the first 26 aircraft allocated to B.O.A.C.have been manufactured and are ready for assembly.(b) The effect of cancellation on the reputation of British civil aircraft.  cannot be,, lightly disregarded.(c) The deficit on the Empire services over the next 5 years is likelyto be the same whether the Tudor II order is cancelled or not,since the cost of operating the Tudor II is balanced by the costof cancellation.(d) Operation of the Tudor II type would provide some insurance againstthe possibility of the Hermes being delayed, in which case the tudor IIs could be amortised over a correspondingly longer period.(e) The Tudor II carries more payload than the York, which on present plans will be retained in service on the route to the Middle Eastuntil 1950, and has a better take-off performance.(/) The Tudor II and the Tudor IVB ought not to be counted as entirely separate aircraft. The engines, propellors and a substantial pro-portion of the airframe and equipment spares are common to bothtypes. Moreover, as B.O.A.C. indicated in their report for theyear 1946/47, some of the work involved in introducing the Tudor IIinto service has already been done.(g) If flight refuelling could be applied to the Tudor II (and there doesnot appear to be any insuperable technical difficulty about this)the aircraft should be able to carry an economic payload through-out the Empire routes either by taking off from critical airfields at reduced weight and refuelling after take-off, or else by overflyingthem according to operational needs and traffic.81. We do not feel that we can attempt to resolve the questions raised in the preceding paragraphs. We were constituted as a Committee to examinethe development and production of the Tudor aircraft and any conclusions(&apos;) See Appendix B.
about the future use of the aircraft would involve us in a consideration of theeconomic and technical problems of airline operation as well as the financial relations between B.O.A.C. and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. We feel,however, that it may be helpful if we discuss briefly some of the considerations which seem to us to be relevant.82,   It is clear that whether Tudor IIs are used for operation of theEmpire routes or whether these routes continue to be operated by the present^ypes of aircraft there will be a very substantial charge on public funds.   Itis possible, however, that a decision not to operate the aircraft might involve an increased charge if other types have to be ordered in its place.83. Although the charge, on public funds would not materially differwhether or not the Tudor II was operated, this does not mean that B.O.A.C.&apos;financial position would necessarily be unaffected. If the Tudor II is broughtinto service by B.O.A.C., the Corporation would presumably have to bear the operating loss, which would take account of the capital cost of the aircraft andthe cost of training crews and providing spares and maintenance organisation.If, on the other hand, the contract were cancelled, it seems doubtful whetherthe Ministry of Civil Aviation, on whose behalf the aircraft were ordered,would pass on the costs of cancellation to the Corporation. Thus, although in both cases the losses would ultimately fall to be borne by public funds, in thelatter case the Exchequer might meet them directly, while in the former case they would be met indirectly by way of the subsidy to B.O.A.C.&quot;84. We feel that B.O.A.C. cannot reasonably be asked to accept a decisionto operate the Tudor II unless they can be assured that this would not havethe effect of worsening their financial position by transferring to themliabilities which otherwise would not fall oh them.85. In addition to these, mainly financial, considerations affecting theCorporation, there are others of a different kind. Thus, a decision to operate the aircraft would avoid a waste of effort, labour and materials which in our.present stringency ought not to be contemplated if any other rational course is open. It would avoid any adverse effect on the reputation of British civil aircraft which might result from cancellation, and at the same time it wouldenable operational experience to be gained to the ultimate benefit of futureBritish types. Further, it would provide an insurance against delay in theintroduction of later types and afford an opportunity to explore the possibilitiesof flight refuelling. Finally, it seems reasonable to hope that as airfielddevelopment progresses the potential economic qualities of the aircraft wouldbe more fully realised.CONCLUSIONS86.   Following is a summary of our principal conclusions : (1) Delay in the production of the aircraft has arisen from three maincauses : (a) The need to await the completion of the aerodynamic investigations ofthe Tudor I so that improvements decided on in that aircraft couldbe incorporated in the Tudor II. (Paragraph 18.)&quot; (b) Failure to determine in good time financial responsibility for the project as a whole and particularly for the alterations required byB.O.A.C., which, pending settlement of questions of financialliability, has held up completion of the first six aircraft. (Para-graphs 28-31.)(c) Changes in requirements imposed by B.OA.C. both on their own.   account and on behalf of the Commonwealth operators.   (Para-graphs 20-27 and 32.)
(2) The tare weight of the aircraft in comparison with that estimated inDecember 1944 has increased by some 7,650 lb. (paragraph 39) and this hasled to a reduction in estimated performance. The main causes of this increaseare: (a) Under-estimation of structure weight on the part of the designer.. (Paragraph 40.)(6) Insistence by the operators on certain standards of passenger and freightaccommodation which have necessitated increases in fuselage dimerlsions and in the weight of fuselage and fittings. (Paragraphs 21-27,40 and 45-47.)(c) Airworthiness requirements imposed by the Air Registration Board.(Paragraph 40.)(3) On the assumptions now current regarding the estimated performance of the Tudor II and the conditions under which it would operate, its field ofusefulness is restricted and it offers less advantage over current types atpresent in service, such as the York, than was originally expected. The main reasons are : (a) None of the parties concerned accepted the responsibility progressivelyto relate the penalties in loss of performance to the actual require-ments of the routes, and the design was allowed to drift away fromthe original conception. The operators put forward requirements for alterations and modifications without apparently paying muchregard to their effect on the design of the aircraft and its per-formance, and the designers accepted these requirements too readily,without first insisting on agreement to the penalties involved. Inthe result the aircraft has not only suffered a serious increase inweight affecting range and take-off performance, but has acquireda volumetric capacity greater than that required for the load it isable to carry on the Empire routes for which it was originally intended. (Paragraph 34.) If minimum performance requirementsrelated to actual operating conditions on the routes had been madeavailable, all concerned would have been aware of the ultimate objective and the designer would have been in no doubt as to thelimit of permissible design changes and weight increases. While the primary responsibility for failure to state requirements must reston B.O.A.C., the ultimate responsibility rested on the GovernmentDepartments concerned to ensure that performance requirementswere drawn up and transmitted to the constructors. There was a failure to discharge this responsibility. (Paragraphs 70 and 71.)(6) The development of the airfields on the proposed routes, which it was hoped to accomplish in. time for Tudor II operations, has so farfailed to materialise and has prevented the potential economic advantages of the Tudor II from being realised on some stages.(Paragraphs 61, 65-66 and 74.)(4) The result of these factors is that it has become difficult to justify theoperation of the Tudor II on routes east of Calcutta and south of Nairobi.It does, however, offer quite substantial advantages in take-off performance,payload and passenger amenities over the York for services to India, egypt and East and West Africa.   (Paragraph 74.)(5) Even now the operational and economic qualities of the Tudor IImight be improved sufficiently to enable it to operate satisfactorily over all
the Empire routes, including those to Australia and South Africa, if some or all of the following methods should prove practicable;  (a) The tare weight of the aircraft might be reduced to allow a take-off at a lower all-up weight or alternatively to carry more useful load.(Paragraph 50.)(b) Flight refuelling might be applied to enable the Tudor II to carry aneconomic payload throughout the Empire routes, or, where neces-sary, to take off at reduced weight.   (Paragraph 80.)* (c) B.O.A.C. might relax the most stringent of their operating conditionsso as to enable the Tudor II to operate on routes on which theYork, with a similar range and lower take-off performance, hasbeen in service.   (Paragraph 73.)(6) We suggest that the considerations mentioned in paragraph (5) above should be taken into account in arriving at a decision regarding the future ofthe Tudor U, as should also the following factors:  (a) At the present time there are no measured figures based on trials ofthe Tudor II in its present form, from which to assess the performance of the aircraft on the Empire routes. The prototypehas, however, now been sent to Boscombe Down and performancedata may be expected shortly.  (Paragraph 72.)(b) The charge on public funds will be approximately the same whetheror not Tudor IIs are used for operation on the Empire routes.(Paragraph 82.)(c) B.O.A.C.&apos;s financial position is not, however, similarly unaffected, andwe feel that they cannot reasonably be asked to accept a decisionto operate the Tudor II unless they can be assured that their financial position will not thereby be worsened. (Paragraphs 83and 84.)(d) A decision to operate the Tudor II would avoid the waste of effort and materials and any adverse effect on the reputation of british civil aircraft which would result from the cancellation of the order,and would provide an insurance against delay in the introductionof later types.

Accommodation for 12 sleeping passengers. 16 were ordered and are now being converted to Tudor IVBs (see below).Tudor III. The same as the Tudor I except for a change in cabin layout. Two are being produced for use by Cabinet Ministers.Tudor IV. The B.S.A.A. version of the Tudor I, for services on the South Atlantic.The fuselage is lengthened by about 6 feet to provide accommodation for 32 day passengers.tj^ft aircraft are on order.Tudor IVB. The B.O.A.C. conversion of the 16 Tudor Is, intended for use on theEmpire routes.   It is the same as the Tudor IV except for a variation in crew accommodation.(b) Tudor II and variantsTudor II. Intended for use by B.O.A.C. on the Empire routes. It has a larger bodythan the Tudor I to accommodate more payload (36/40 day and 22 night passengers) formedium ranges.   26 are on order for B.O.A.C., and a further 17 are unallocated.Tudor V. The B.S.A.A. version of the Tudor II for services on the South Atlantic. Itis the same externally as the Tudor II but accommodates 44 day passengers.   6 are on order.Tudor VII. The Tudor II fitted with Hercules engines. One prototype has been sofitted.35470 Wt.-6/4S f.o.p.
180APPENDIX IIPRELIMINARY INDICATION5 RESULTING- PROM REGENTTRIALS OF TUDOR IISince the completion of the investigation by theCommittee of Enquiry into the Tudor aircraft,  limited flighttrials hove been made with a prototype Tudor II aircraft bythe AAEE,  Boscombe Down.      These included a flight toKhartoum and Nairobi during which observations under tropicalconditions were mode.The results of a preliminary analysis of thesetrials are unexpected and disappointing.      The distancerequired to take-off is greater than had been estimated,the rate of climb on three engines is less and the fuelconsumption rather higher.      In addition, there was in roughair an unpleasant lateral vibration of the fuselage and aperiodic longitudinal buffeting which, while probably notaffecting the air-worthiness of the aircraft, would undoubtedly be criticised severely by air line operators.The testing of the aircraft is still uncompletedand the results of the tests made have not yet been fullyanalysed.      The conclusions may,  therefore, be modified indetail.      Further,   the tests have been confined to oneprototype aircraft which may possibly be a rogue.      Nevertheless,the above results show that further experimental work will benecessary to diagnose the  present troubles and to ensure thatthey do not occur in production aircraft,  and it is impossible at this stage to estimate how long such work would take.12th July, -191+8
