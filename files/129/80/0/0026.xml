mis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 7612th March, 1956CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesWhen the Cabinet discussed the Report of the Round Table Conference on 4th January, they deferred their decision on its principal recommendation untilthe Colonial Policy Committee had considered the whole Report in more detail(CM. (56) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 4). That Committee (with the addition ofthe Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary andthe First Lord of the Adrrtiralty) have since discussed the Report and have reachedthe following main conclusions:  (a) No further statement, additional to my reply to Mr. Griffiths&apos; Question1st February, about the protection of Roman Catholic interests in malta, should be made at this stage.(b) In the debate in Parliament on the Report, which is likely to be heldearly in March, Government supporters should not be free to vote against the policy advocated by the Government.(c) Acceptance of the constitutional proposals in the Report should not involve Her Majesty&apos;s Government in any obligation to providefinancial assistance to Malta.in excess of the levels at present forecast.(d) It should be recommended to the Cabinet that steps should be taken tointroduce constitutional changes and consultative machinery on thelines considered by the Conference.(e) No decision need be taken on the question of Ministerial responsibilityfor Malta&apos;s affairs before the completion of other constitutional changes.(/) The question of repercussions elsewhere should be reserved for theCabinet.2. In discussing the particular issue of the referendum results, the committee agreed that it was desirable to arrest the deterioration in the relations between the maltese Government and the Roman Catholic Church in Malta, and that theyshould reach some sort of concordat. The Committee also thought that, subjectto a favourable decision by Parliament on the Report and to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ position on the question of future financial assistance being made clear, a further General Election should eventually be held in Malta to confirm that the Maltese people were clearly in favour of the scheme of closer association.It was agreed that I should recall the Governor of Malta for discussions, and thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and I should consult together on the question offinancial assistance.Financial Assistance3. Discussions between officials are proceeding and I hope that it will bepossible to reach agreement with the Treasury very soon on the form and level ofthe financial assistance to be offered to the Maltese Government, in accordancewith the recommendations in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the Report, when the time comes to negotiate with them a new financial arrangement. Although Mr. Mintoff,the Prime Minister of Malta, may raise this matter during his visit to London (see below), it is unlikely that he will be in a position for some months to provide a49693B
2detailed programme of expenditure, especially on the capital side, on which detailed negotiations on the actual amount of financial assistance to be provided this yearcould be conducted; and the Government ought, I suggest, to limit themselvesin the debate on the Report to stating their policy on the lines of (c) of paragraph 1above. There is certainly, in my view, no need to defer the debate on the main issue until detailed financial arrangements have been worked out. Indeed, it wouldbe impossible to negotiate satisfactory long-term arrangements with Mr. Mintoffuntil the Governments line on the main proposal for representation at Westminsterhas been announced.The Governors Visit4. The Governor arrived in London on 23rd February and spent several daysdiscussing the situation with some of my colleagues and myself. I attach asummary of the views he put forward on the general situation at that time(Annex A). It will be seen that he considered it essential to reach an understanding with the Maltese Government and to arrange for the debate on the Report to beheld as soon as possible.  Subsequent events have confirmed him in this view.5. As the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet on 28th February (CM. (56)7th Conclusions, Minute 6), the Governor broke his return journey to Malta tohave interviews in Rome on 29th February with the Pope and the Pro-Secretaryof State, Mgr. Tardini. I myself arranged to stop in Malta, on my way home from my visit to Cyprus, for a few hours during the evening of 29th february and had useful conversations with the Governor, the Archbishop of Malta,Mr. Mintoff and the other local political leaders.6. Briefly, the Governor found a disposition at the Vatican to influence the archbishop of Malta to refrain from continuing controversy with the maltese government and to resume negotiations with the latter with the object of reaching a concordat. As a result of my conversations subsequently in Malta with theGovernor and Mr. Mintoff, who was ill in bed, I considered it desirable to acceptMr. Mintoff&apos;s proposal that he should come to London as soon as he had recoveredto continue discussions with me.Present Position7. Mr. Mintoffs concern is obviously to learn at first hand what steps theGovernment intend to take on the recommendations of the Round table conference. As he has, in the meantime, been observing the truce, which theGovernor proposed, in exchanges between the Roman Catholic Church in malta and the Maltese Government, despite a virtual failure to do so on the part of the archbishop of Malta and his supporters and considerable provocation in the maltese Press, Mr. Mintoff will no doubt strongly urge that the Government should arrange to hold the promised debate in Parliament without further delay. He willargue that the political situation in Malta cannot be held much longer. He may even press for the Government to announce a favourable decision in advance ofthe debate.8. On the basis of the Governofs assessment of the dangers involved inthe present situation, and my own conversations with Maltese political leadersI am convinced that the longer the delay in holding the debate, the greater thedanger of serious consequences in the political situation in Malta, and of anirremediable breach between the Maltese Government and the Roman catholic church in Malta.Repercussions Elsewhere9. As I stated in paragraph 7 of CP. (55) 133, it does not seem likely thatrepresentation for Malta at Westminster will stimulate immediate pressure for similar treatment in any other Colonial territory and it should be possible topresent the solution for Malta&apos;s relationship with the United Kingdom as appropriate to Malta&apos;s unique circumstances. A Committee of Officials have considered how this aspect of the matter could best be covered in the debate andI attach the draft which they have prepared for inclusion in a speech by aGovernment spokesman (Annex C).
21. I appreciate that there are difficulties from Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;spoint of view in doing this at the present time and particularly before the debate in Parliament. I therefore strongly urge that the debate in Parliament shouldtake place as soon as possible so that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are free to mediate in the quarrel between the Archbishop of Malta and Mr. Mintoff and tonegotiate without any delay on the provision of guarantees to the Vatican aboutthe powers of the United Kingdom Parliament. Otherwise the situation in Maltamay deteriorate beyond recovery.22. If my views are accepted, the proper sequence of further steps wouldseem to be as follows:  (a) informal discussion at the Vatican on my way back to Malta;(b) further attempts to induce Mr. Mintoff and the Archbishop of Malta toreach a modus vivendi;(d) debate in Parliament as soon as possible with the object of allowing her majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with the following further steps;(d) negotiations with the Maltese Government on the scheme of &quot; integration &quot;if and as approved by Parliament;(e) negotiation of guarantees concerning Parliaments use of overriding powers with the Vatican and with the Archbishop of Malta;(/) formal conclusion of modus vivendi between the Maltese Government andthe Roman Catholic Church of Malta;(g) further test of the clear and unmistakable wishes of the Maltese peopleeither by a referendum run from start to finish by an impartial outsideagency, or a general election;(h) further debate in the United Kingdom Parliament.ANNEX draft MOTIONThat this House approves the recommendations contained in the Report of the malta Round Table Conference; confirms the assurances referred to in paragraph79 of the Report; approves the recommendations contained in paragraph 85 of theReport concerning the legislative authority of the Maltese Parliament in alldomestic affairs and, in particular, on such matters as the position of Churcheducation and family life, subject to the principle of religious freedom, as embodied in the Declaration of Rights of 1802 and in the present Constitution Letters Patent;welcomes the proposal of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with measures to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Round Table Conference and,subject to the House being satisfied that to do so would be in accordance with the clear and unmistakable wishes of the Maltese people, to introduce in due course the necessary legislation to give effect thereto.ANNEX CDRAFT SECTION ON REPERCUSSIONS FOR INCLUSION INGOVERNMENT SPEECH IN MALTA DEBATEI come now to the implications of representation at Westminster for other colonial territories. Every country large or small has certain political and culturaltraditions which compose its history and determine the outlook of its people; andwhen we say that Malta is unique, we must always remember that to any countryits history is something peculiarly its own. On the other hand, our Colonial policy would have had little value had it not encouraged and taught the principles and customs of democratic self-government which we in this country have evolved.Malta has a leading place among the territories in which self-government has been
Recommendations10. I recommend, therefore, that the Cabinet should now decide the timing of the debate in Parliament and the way in which it should be handled, includingthe terms of the Government motion. I suggest, for the consideration of mycolleagues, that the decisions on these points should be as follows:  (i) Timing of the Debate. The debate should be held before Parliament risesfor the Easter recess, i.e., between 19th-29th March.(ii) Handling of the Debate. It would be preferable, in my view, to hold the debate on a positive Government motion accepting the main recom-mendations of the Report, and making particular reference to safeguards for the Roman Catholic Church in Malta on the lines of paragraph 79of the Report. The Government^ views on the detailed safeguards forthe Roman Catholic Church by the Maltese Government, on futurefinancial assistance and on the need for any further test of the wishes of the Maltese people, could be given by Government spokesmen duringthe debate.I attach a draft motion on these lines (Annex B).11. To assist in the debate, I suggest that we might issue a brief factual white paper recalling the origin of the Round Table Conference, and containing a selection of the important non-confidential documents, e.g., the Referendumproposals, the Maltese referendum law and the Archbishop of Malta&apos;s PastoralLetters. Copies of the verbatim records of the Plenary Sessions of the Conference,which were open to the Press, could be made available in the Library of the Houseof Commons. It would not, however, be desirable to make available any of the confidential records of the Conference, which include the memorandum submittedby the Government, and the memoranda submitted by the Maltese Government,the Archbishop of Malta and the Bishop of Gibraltar.12. If my colleagues see no objection, I would propose to inform Mr. Mintoffin confidence, prior to his return to Malta, of the steps the Government are proposing to take.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,10th March, 1956.ANNEX AMEMORANDUM BY GOVERNOR OF MALTA24th February, 1956The following is an attempt to sum up in brief compass the present politicalsituation and possible courses for the future.The Object of British Policy in Malta2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government retain their position in Malta partly from a sense of duty to do the right thing by the people of Malta who voluntarily put themselves under British protection and who should not be left in the lurch: andpartly because of the Island&apos;s usefulness for defence purposes. It is the secondobjective that is principally at stake in the present situation.3. To- use-Malta efficiently for defence, Her MajestyV Government require toretain sufficient powers to impose their policy in matters of defence and foreignaffairs. All constitutional solutions so far seriously studied are based on this requirement. Secondly, to the same end, Her Majesty&apos;s Government require a reasonably contented local population prepared to co-operate in the use of the island for defence purposes.4. It follows inescapably that Her Majesty&apos;s Government must try to retain the democratic process in Malta, since without it, the population having become49693 B 2
politically conscious to the present extent, there can be no question of contentedMaltese co-operation in the use of the Island for defence. Except in war or someother grave emergency, suspension of the Constitution for any length of timesimply would not work.The Means of Carrying out this Policy5. Given the necessity to retain the democratic process in Malta in peace, itis essential to provide a Constitution which the Maltese people are prepared towork in co-operation with Her Majesty&apos;s Government. To this end, not only thematerial and economic requirements of the Maltese people must be satisfied to anadequate standard, but also, for want of better words, their prestige and&quot; spiritual &quot; requirements. It was with the object of satisfying these requirementsthat the present Malta Labour Government proposed representation at westminster, and the Nationalist Opposition, Dominion status. The latter wouldnot raise an issue with the Church. The present Maltese Prime Minister has raisedthis issue, and one can therefore add to the list of requirements the &quot; spiritual&quot;requirement, i.e., some modus vivendi with the Roman Catholic Church.The Prospects following the Referendum6. Whatever else the Referendum result may show, it demonstrates clearly thatdespite the strongest opposition brought against them by the Church, by bothOpposition parties, and by the Strickland Press, the Malta Labour Party machinecan still line up sufficient votes to give the party an almost certain chance of victory in any forthcoming election. In the face of the Referendum result, it is not possibleto foresee either of the other parties, or any new party, taking office democratically,unless Mr. Mintoff deliberately chooses to wreck the Malta Labour Party by going into retirement. On present prospects, he will almost certainly be able to retainoffice if he wishes to for the next year or two, beyond which one cannot see clearly.The Political Parties7. The Malta Labour Party have a well oiled political machine but only oneleader, Mr. Mintoff, and (so far as our information goes) only three individuals ofany calibre to support him, none of whom could adequately replace him if he left political life. The three are Mr. Cole an able administrator up to a point,quite a good Number Two, but weak and characterless when left to himself in a crisis: Dr. Cassar good within his sphere as Minister of Justice, but without any great party following which could enable him to run as an alternative for the partyleadership: Miss Barbara fairly competent as a Minister, and certainly notnegligible as a personality and one of the party&apos;s most consistent vote-getters.But it is doubtful whether a woman could possibly lead the party in presentcircumstances.The Nationalist Party8. Both the party and its leader, Dr. Borg Olivier, lost a great deal of facefor their inactive and negative boycott policy during the Referendum campaign.The high number of abstensions may have regained some of the lost ground, butthat is doubtful. The solid fact remains that the rank and file of supporters aredissatisfied with Dr. Borg OUvier&apos;s leadership, and that, so far, intrigues to get himreplaced have not succeeded. Dr. Felice and Dr. Albert Ganado are tipped aspossible successors, but the latter has no seat in the present Assembly.9. It is unfortunately not possible to foresee smooth working relationsbetween Britain and Malta in defence or any other matters with the nationalist party, as at present constituted, in office. If they took office, they would certainly not drop their demands for a limited form of Dominion status; also, the party hasno good administrators and the machine of public business would undoubtedlybecome clogged and unworkable as it was when the Nationalists were last in office. There is no satisfactory alternative Government here: if there were, theprospects of its taking office would be remote.Progressive Constitutional Party10. This party is a personal creation of Miss Strickland&apos;s. It is both vocal,especially because of its domination of the local press, and energetic, because of miss Strickland&apos;s drive.  Its programme is sensible, but at the cost of ignoring the
5   ;need for some form of psychological settlement. Miss Strickland&apos;s real positiveobjective is more to upset Mr. Mintoff&apos;s apple-cart than anything else. She is not personally popular, has no political flair, and from the way she deluges all andsundry with paper, is probably not a good administrator. Her chances of being returned to office by the electorate within the foreseeable future are negligible,because she commands no support among the people, nor can she speak theirlanguage.The Present Situation11. The conclusion from the above is inescapable. We must try as long aspossible to arrive at some sort of modus vivendi with Mr. Mintoff and the MaltaLabour Party, since he is the only party leader with administrative efficiency anddrive, and his party seems likely to command a majority of the votes for the nextyear or two always subject to Mr. Mintoffs deciding to stay in office and in politics. One cannot emphasise too strongly that it is quite useless to think of the many alternative eminently reasonable and workable solutions to the Malteseproblem which can be evolved by any one tackling the problem without regard toMr. Mintoff and what he stands for. He has the votes, and the choice is either towork with him or to scrap the democractic process.The Problem of Working with Mr. Mintoff12. He has striking virtues: he is not now vocally anti-British, though hehas been in the past, he is efficient, energetic and uninterested either in personalgain or in prestige. But equally, he is ill-balanced and mercurial; aggressive,uncompromising and insufferable when elated: defeatist and spiritless whendepressed. He is obsessed by a number of complexes deriving from his experiencesduring his childhood and youth, and in the course of his education and earlymanhood in England. He is overwhelmed with a sense of being discriminatedagainst and his most sincere principal objective is to get the Maltese recognised as worth as much in pay, prestige and other standards of value, as the Englishman even though he is intellectually honest enough to recognise that the comparison is not really valid. He has two other obsessions which are at the root of most ofour current difficulties an overwhelming desire to clip the wings of the roman catholic Church, which he sees as the obstacle to enlightenment and progress in malta, and a deep and abiding hatred of Miss Strickland, the Times of Malta, andall they stand for.13. To him, the demand for representation at Westminster, though he knowsit will mean almost nothing in practice, is of crucial importance because it bringsMalta on to the same political level as England. It will be impossible to get himto accept the other benefits of the integration programme without the (to him)essential concomitants of parity with the United Kingdom in politicalrepresentation, and &quot; equivalence &quot; with United Kingdom standards.Lines of a Possible Settlement with Mr. Mintoff14. His verdict on the Referendum result is that it would have shown him asatisfactory overall majority but for the attitude of the Church. This may possibly be true but it is also a fact that his attitude to the Church, his prosecution of a priest,and his allusions to the Archbishop in public speeches have profoundly shockedCatholic Malta and probably accounted for more &quot; Nos &quot; and abstentions in the referendum than did the Archbishop&apos;s broadcast. Nevertheless, he still considersthat if the Church&apos;s difficulties can be got out of the way, the British parliament could either take the view that the Referendum result could now be regarded as satisfactory, or that some future test in which the Church would not opposeintegration would have every prospect of showing a satisfactory result.Possible Postponement15. Mr. Mintoff has nailed his colours to the mast of &quot; Integration now ornever.&quot; It is most doubtfui whether he would be willing to accept a solutionby which we would stay in office working towards integration, and after someperiod of a year or more when local passions would have died, the question of representation at Westminster could be reconsidered. He would rightly argue thatMalta would be in a state of turmoil, with the Church covertly, and Miss Stricklandovertly, continuing to fight until the representation question was settled.   A
possible variant of the postponement principle which he is known to be willing to favour is that the integration solution should be worked out to the point of havingConstitutional Instruments ready for implementation, after which he would go tothe country for a mandate to introduce a new integrated Constitution includingrepresentation at Westminster,.The Consequences of Failure16. It is unlikely that a serious security situation would arise in Malta of the magnitude of, for example, Cyprus. If his co-operation ceases, however,Mr. Mintoff can undoubtedly make it exceedingly hot for the British in Malta, andthe efficiency of the defence base is bound to suffer. The Malta Labour Party havenever removed from their programme the alternative of full self-determination andrent for bases, and if integration is lost, they may turn to that alternative. Seriousorganised terrorism is perhaps not to be expected, but individual violent incidentscertainly cannot be ruled out. The British Service population is so inextricablyintermingled with the Maltese, that life could easily be made intolerable for theBritish even in quasi-legal ways, so long as the Constitution remains withoutresorting to throwing bombs.Defence Projects17. A number of defence projects of the highest importance the extensionof airfield facilities for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.), a largeunderground oil storage scheme, mining exercise areas and other matters cannotbe taken beyond a certain point without a settlement with Mr. Mintoff. It is becoming urgent to get final decisions on these problems, and he will certainly not budge until he is sure that something like integration is to come about. Itis useless to think of using the reserve powers under the present Constitution, as this would nullify the extent of co-operation so far given by the Malta labour government, and would give the Assembly in particular, and the country in general,opportunity to ride off on one of those unanimous anti-British resolutions withwhich the N.A.T.O. privileges question has already made us familiar. To usereserve powers on one of these major defence issues, however important, wouldprobably wreck all hopes of a satisfactory political settlement. Hence too much time cannot be taken. Failure to reach some solution within at most a few monthsmay produce a situation as difficult for Her Majesty&apos;s Government in its differentway as the present one in Cyprus.The Church Problem18. Mr. Mintoff has agreed to negotiate with the Archbishop of Malta aboutguarantees for the Roman Catholic Church. He will not be easy to handle whenit comes to defining in concrete terms the guarantees he has already given, but hehas accepted that when it comes to the point, he will have to bargain with theChurch for a settlement. The Archbishop&apos;s attitude is proving much more difficult.After expressing willingness to negotiate, he has manoeuvred in every possible wayto avoid starting negotiations and has now gone back on previous indications thathe might be willing to come to London with Mintoff for discussions with her majesty&apos;s Government in an attempt to reach agreement before the debate inParliament. He has now said openly that he proposes to wait until after theParliamentary debate, i.e., until after, as he thinks, integration has been finally-torpedoed.19. I propose to call in at Rome on my way back to Malta in order to renewuseful personal contacts I have already made in the Vatican. I hope to see HisHoliness the Pope and the Pro-Secretary of State, Mgr. Tardini, with the objectof giving them an impartial account of recent developments in Malta, stressing the dangers of allowing relations between the Archbishop and Mr. Mintoff to deteriorate further and indicating that it is desirable for them to use their influence to encourage the resumption of negotiations for a local agreement between the archbishop and Mr. Mintoff. I would not, of course, say anything to prejudiceHer Majesty&apos;s Government^ position in advance of the debate in Parliament onthe Report of the Round Table Conference.20. .It is doubtful, however, even if negotiations were resumed in Maltawhether they could be successful until Her Majesty&apos;s Government are free tostep into the picture.
21. I appreciate that there are difficulties from Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentspoint of view in doing this at the present time and particularly before the debate in Parliament. I therefore strongiy urge that the debate in Parliament shouldtake place as soon as possible so that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are free to mediate in the quarrel between the Archbishop of Malta and Mr. Mintoff and tonegotiate without any delay on the provision of guarantees to the Vatican aboutthe powers of the United Kingdom Parliament. Otherwise the situation in Maltamay deteriorate beyond recovery.22. If my views are accepted, the proper sequence of further steps wouldseem to be as follows:  (a) informal discussion at the Vatican on my way back to Malta;(b) further attempts to induce Mr. Mintoff and the Archbishop of Malta toreach a modus vivendi;(c) debate in Parliament as soon as possible with the object of allowing her majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with the following further steps;(d) negotiations with the Maltese Government on the scheme of &quot; integration &quot;if and as approved by Parliament;(e) negotiation of guarantees concerning Parliaments use of overriding powers with the Vatican and with the Archbishop of Malta;if) formal conclusion of modus vivendi between the Maltese Government andthe Roman Catholic Church of Malta;ig) further test of the clear and unmistakable wishes of the Maltese peopleeither by a referendum run from start to finish by an impartial outsideagency, or a general election;(h) further debate in the United Kingdom Parliament.ANNEX draft MOTIONThat this House approves the recommendations contained in the Report of the malta Round Table Conference; confirms the assurances referred to in paragraph79 of the Report; approves the recommendations contained in paragraph 85 of theReport concerning the legislative authority of the Maltese Parliament in alldomestic affairs and, in particular, on such matters as the position of Churcheducation and family life, subject to the principle of religious freedom, as embodied in the Declaration of Rights of 1802 and in the present Constitution Letters Patent;welcomes the proposal of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with measures to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Round Table Conference and,subject to the House being satisfied that to do so would be in accordance with the clear and unmistakable wishes of the Maltese people, to introduce in due course the necessary legislation to give effect thereto.ANNEX CDRAFT SECTION ON REPERCUSSIONS FOR INCLUSION INGOVERNMENT SPEECH IN MALTA DEBATEI come now to the implications of representation at Westminster for other colonial territories. Every country large or small has certain political and culturaltraditions which compose its history and determine the outlook of its people; andwhen we say that Malta is unique, we must always remember that to any countryits history is something peculiarly its own. On the other hand, our Colonial policy would have had little value had it not encouraged and taught the principles and customs of democratic self-government which we in this country have evolved.Malta has a leading place among the territories in which self-government has been
developed. Some of the Colonial territories will, we hope, achieve full self-government within the Commonwealth, on their own or as units in largerFederations. But as paragraph 70 of the Report makes clear, there are practicalobstacles in the way of full self-government in Malta. The emphasis of Malta&apos;shistory, during the 150 years of its association with Great Britain, has been upon its strategic importance, and its economic dependence on us, arising out of thepredominance of our defence expenditure, and the island&apos;s lack of natural resources.These are the principal reasons why it would not be right or reasonable to expect the people of this small island, who have achieved so large a measure ofself-government in their internal affairs, to assume the heavy additionalresponsibilities involved by full self-government.2. Paragraph 77 of the Report argues that these, and other circumstances,make Malta&apos;s situation quite exceptional. There are of course a few other colonial territories which are in a similar position in so far as it does not appearlikely that they can, under modern conditions, expect to achieve full self-government including control of defence and external relations. But Maltais distinguished from these other territories in several ways. She joined her futurewith Great Britain of her own free will and it is her own elected representatives who have asked for representation at Westminster to-day; she is geographicallyclose to the United Kingdom in distance or in time; she has a record of peculiardistinction and association with us in two world wars, especially the war of 1939to 1945; her economy and the lives of the greater part of her population, are largelysustained by expenditure of departments of the United Kingdom Government,especially the Admiralty; and the activities of the Service Departments areinextricably bound up with those of the Civil Government.3. Now, there are other Colonial territories to which one or more of thesecircumstances apply; but to none do all of them apply in such marked measure;and Her Majesty&apos;s Government feel able to endorse the argument in paragraph 77of the Report that the justification of Malta&apos;s claim to representation at westminster can be based on the &quot; quite exceptional circumstances and position &quot;of the Island. Her Majesty&apos;s Government can also endorse the Report when itgoes on to say that, because of these quite exceptional circumstances, it is not considered that claims for similar treatment from other quarters should arise whichcannot be dealt with on their own merits. It may be that in time some other territories will ask to be given representation at Westminster, but so far as one can see such requests are not likely to be numerous. Some of the smaller territories,when they recognise the practical difficulties with which full self-government wouldconfront them, and realise that in consequence they must leave to the UnitedKingdom certain over-riding responsibilities for their security, may equallyrecognise the unsuitability of representation at Westminster. In some of them thesystem of taxation, and its general level, differ widely from ours. For others a close approach to equivalent in social welfare measures seems hardly a practical proposition. Our task must therefore be to devise for these territories for which full self-government appears unlikely, means whereby the greatest practical amountof local management in internal affairs can be combined and harmonised with theretention by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of responsibility for defence and external affairs. I assured this House on 21st of lune last year that I would study thisparticular problem which most of us can recognise if we call it &quot; the problem ofthe smaller territories.&quot; I have continued and shall continue to do so. I am notyet in a position to propound any general solution. But perhaps we would be onthe right lines if we thought in terms of a system which gave a distinct identity toterritories which reach the stage of maximum self-government in internal affairs which is compatible with the retention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^responsibilities in certain fields such as defence and external relations. We must,I would repeat, feel our way with care and tact in this matter and I would pointout that I have no evidence that the people of any territory wish to be treatedprecisely like Malta. We would not wish them to try to distort their own problemsinto the likeness of Malta&apos;s by regarding what is now proposed as a precedent.
