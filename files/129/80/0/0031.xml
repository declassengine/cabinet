THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1956SECRET Copy No. 5 2CP. (56) 8117th March, 1956CABINETAGRICULTURE: DISCIPLINARY POWERS and security OF TENUREMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealSince the Cabinet last considered the question of disciplinary powers and security of tenure in the agricultural industry CM. (55) 24th Conclusions,Minute 6 the Home Affairs Committee have been examining the various courses of action which are open to the Government. Thorough discussion has shown thatthis difficult and delicate issue must now be submitted to the Cabinet for finaldecision.The Existing Position2.   The existing law is as follows:  (a) Disciplinary PowersPart II of the Agriculture Act, 1947, and the corresponding provisions of the agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, give Ministers powers to secure that reasonablestandards of efficiency are maintained. Farmers and land-owners can be placed under supervision, given directions and, in the last resort, dispossessed of their land.The powers are delegated to Agricultural Executive Committees; but dispossessioncannot take place without the consent of the Minister. In the most important cases(including dispossession) there is a right of appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal(or, in Scotland, to the Land Court).(b) Security of Tenure for Tenant FarmersThe Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948, and the corresponding Scottish statute of 1949 provide that if a tenant objects to a notice to quit from his landlord, thenotice does not become effective without the Minister^ consent. This consent mustbe withheld unless the Minister is satisfied that to grant consent would lead to greater efficiency. Consent may also be withheld on hardship grounds. Here too,there is a right of appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal.The Need for Action3. For the following reasons, it is clear that these statutory provisions nowrequire to be reconsidered:  (i) The disciplinary powers are regarded by a section of (mainly non-farming)public opinion as objectionable in principle, as constituting an unreasonable encroachment on the liberty of the subject. Moreover,since there is no definite yardstick by which good husbandry can be precisely defined and measured, there tends to be a feeling that thepowers are administered on an unfair and discriminatory basis. this feeling becomes more acute as disciplinary action itself becomes morerare. The powers have, for all practical purposes, fallen into disuse;and it can be argued, with reason, that the law should either be properlyadministered or be repealed.49716
These considerations apply mainly in England and Wales. InScotland the existence and exercise of the powers give rise to no particular difficulties,(ii) The provisions of the Agricultural Holdings Acts now provide a tenantfarmer with an excessive degree of security; and their general effect is to impose rigidity on the industry at the expense of efficiency.Agriculture is in danger of becoming a closed shop. Rents are beingdepressed^with the result that insufficient financial pressure is beingexerted on inefficient farmers, and landlords are being prevented fromadequately maintaining and improving fixed equipment. Moreover,it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify a system in which securityof land tenure is coupled with guaranteed prices at a very heavy costto the taxpayer. The Country Landowners Association and the professional bodies are already showing signs of pressing for more vigorous action on security of tenure; and this pressure is likely to befurther stimulated by the publication, in the near future, of theArton Wilson Report, which includes the following comment:  &quot;There is no doubt that the Act has protected the goodtenant-farmer from unreasonable eviction, but we have heard a gooddeal of well-informed criticism that it also gives an undesirable degreeof protection to the indifferent, or even. bad, farmer. Many of our witnesses maintain that in this way the Act is largely defeating its main object. This criticism is perhaps borne out by the figures which showthat landlords have had comparatively little recourse to the Act in orderto terminate tenancies.&quot;The security of tenure provisions are held to be particularly objectionable inScotland, since their effect is reinforced by the special provisions of the Scottish Actwhich enable an heir-at-law or a legatee to succeed to the tenancy of a holding.Possible Lines of Procedure4. The two questions of disciplinary powers and security of tenure, thoughtreated separately in the preceding paragraphs, are, of course, inter-related. If the disciplinary powers were abandoned or relaxed, the security of tenure provisions would also need to be relaxed, in order to enable landlords themselves to get rid of inefficient tenant farmers. And conversely, if the disciplinary powers were retained or implemented more vigorously, it might be impracticable simultaneously to reduce the tenant farmers&apos; security of tenure though, even so, the reasonablerights of the landlord over his own property are entitled to consideration.5. The Home Affairs Committee have formed the view on balance that bothquestions should now be the subject of an independent committee of enquiry. Butthis conclusion is not wholly unanimous; and the arguments for and against it are summarised in the following paragraphs.6.   In favour of an independent committtee of enquiry, it can be urged that:  (a) Although its conclusions are, of course, unpredictable, they could hardly fail to be of some use to the Government in ventilating publicly thedifficulties of this very controversial subject. Thus, in the case of disciplinary powers, a committee&apos;s recommendations might range from,at the one extreme, retention of Part II of the Act, coupled with more vigorous administration to, at the other extreme, its outright repeal, andits replacement by some alternative &quot; sanction,&quot; even though this mightbe no more than advice and persuasion by the Minister.  In the case. of security of tenure, a committee would probably recommend some,. degree of relaxation in favour of the landlord the more so if they had also recommended that the sanctions of the Government under Part ii should be modified or abandoned. But whatever form the committee&apos;conclusions finally took, they could hardly fail, even if not unanimous,to be of some value in clarifying the issue and providing the Government, with a definite basis on which to launch any new policy which might be judged appropriate.
(b) Moreover, there appears to be no real alternative to an independent committee of enquiry. The Home Affairs Committee have consideredboth the possibility of publishing a White Paper (which would describe the problem, state the Government&apos;s provisional views, and provide theoccasion for a Debate; which might be followed by, amending legislation). and the possibility of using more generally the existing statutory powers.which-have-largely fallen into disuse.  But:- -(i) neither course would be prudent unless public opinion was prepared in advance.  In particular, abruptly to publish a White Paper-    would merely provoke the maximum of uninformed controversy;(ii) making more general use of existing statutory powers would haveno effect on the problem of security of tenure.7.   Against an independent committee of enquiry, it can be urged that:  (a) One result of such an enquiry would be simply to reveal inertness on theGovernments part in the implementation of the disciplinary powers,excessive delegation in their exercise, and inability to present convincingreasons for such disciplinary action as has been taken; and since theenquiry could not be expected in any case to be welcome to the farmersits real purpose would become obscured in acrimonious but irrelevantcontroversy.(b) The fundamental difficulty inherent in Part II of the Agriculture Acts isthe difficulty of defining an offence (i.e., the offence of bad husbandry)where a decision must depend essentially on personal judgment. Butthis difficulty exists, and will continue to exist, whether disciplinary actions are exercised by the State or by individual landlords. Ifwe are prepared to increase the powers of landlords in this direction,a report from a committee recommending action to-that effect mightwell be helpful. But are we in fact prepared to endorse such a recommendation or, alternatively, a recommendation that our existing powers should be more generally used? If we are not, we shouldbe merely inviting embarrassment if we constituted an independent committee of enquiry which might result in either -of these recom-mendations. In short, an enquiry would constitute a considerable political risk, which we should take only if we are satisfied:  (i) that, if the enquiry  recommended increasing the power  oflandlords, we should be able to sustain the argument that wewere not merely giving more power to landlords but wererestoring the correct balance of interests between landlords andtenants, which has become distorted since the legislation waspassed eight or nine years ago; or(ii) that, if the enquiry recommended the more general use of ourown powers, that recommendation would itself suffice to dispelthe odium attaching to the exercise of those powers.(c) There would be liable to be an embarrassing overlap between the activitiesof any new enquiry and those of the Franks Committee on administrative Tribunals, &amp;c. Although it is formally true that thenew enquiry would be concerned with policy, while the franks committee is concerned with administrative machinery, it is equallytrue that, in this particular case, the administrative machinery by whichpolicy is put into effect is almost an integral part of the substance of the policy itself. Thus, the existence of the Agricultural lands tribunal is a prominent feature of the relevant provisions of the agriculture Acts. Is it reasonable to suppose that a new committee could make recommendations for stronger action against anincompetent tenant without providing for some procedure of appeal?But in that case, it would find itself involved in discussing theconstitution and working of the existing Agricultural Lands Tribunals;and it would be duplicating, in one corner of the field of administrative tribunals, the investigation which the Franks Committee is conductingover the whole of that field-with the additional&apos;1 risk&apos;that its recom-mendations might conflict with those of the Franks Committee. Thisduplication is not likely to arise in Scotland, since the appeals go toa Court of Law.
(d) An enquiry on this subject could not be expected to be completed in lessthan a year or 18 months. There would, therefore, be no prospectof introducing any consequential legislation in the next Session;indeed, we might be fortunate if we had it ready in time for thebeginning of the 1957-58 Session i.e., the third Session of this parliament. That would be quite near enough to the end of theGovernments life for political safety. And if the timetable of actionslipped any further, we might well find ourselves faced with a need to legislate on this politically thorny issue within sight of the next general Election.conclusion. It is not easy to choose with any certainty between the arguments for and against an independent committee of enquiry. The decision may turn to someextent on the state of relations between the Government and the farmers (havingregard particularly to the results of the current Price Review). But an early decision is of considerable importance. Unless a committee of enquiry is set upvery soon, its report may well not become available in time for action to be taken during the lifetime of the present Parliament. Provided that relations with the farming community remain reasonably good, my colleagues may feel that, on a balance of the considerations, we should be well advised:  (a) To institute an independent committee of enquiry into the questions of disciplinary powers and security of tenure.(b) To set up such an enquiry as soon as possible after the Price Review is out of the way, and to urge it to proceed with the maximum of speed,with a view to securing that any legislation is enacted during the1957-58 Session.(c) To give it limited terms of reference in order to reduce the area of possiblecontroversy. (The Home Affairs Committee considered a suggestionthat the terms of reference should be drawn much more widely, on thelines of those which might be appropriate for a Royal Commission on agriculture, so that the conclusions of the enquiry on the question of disciplinary powers and security of tenure would emerge rather as the by-products of a more comprehensive survey. But they rejected this alternative approach on the ground that it would only widen stillfurther the scope for controversy.)(d) To reduce as far as possible the risk of overlap with the franks committee by strictly confining the terms of reference of the new committee to matters of policy, and indicating clearly to them that, ifthey found themselves unable to avoid making certain recommendations on administrative machinery and procedure, those recommendations would be liable to review in the light of the more fundamental enquiryof the Franks Committee. The terms of reference of the new committee would clearly require careful detailed examination; but, onthis hypothesis, they might run on some such lines as &quot; Having regard to the necessity for promoting full and efficientagricultural production and to the support provided by theExchequer to the agricultural industry to review the disciplinary actions under the Agricultural Act, 1947, and the Agriculture (Scotland)Act, 1948, and the measure and form of security of tenure under theAgricultural Holdings Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Holdings(Scotland) Act, 1949; to consider what changes in the law, if any, in, these matters are required; and to make recommendations.&quot;R.
