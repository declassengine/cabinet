(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.g.(56) 675th March, 1956CABINETCOST OF LIVINGMemorandum, by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance in the latter part of his paper C. P. (56) 66, the Minister of Labourrefers to an index covering the low income groups who, in accordance with paragraph 3(iii)(b) of C. P. (56) 66, will be excluded from his new index of Retail Prices.2.      I do not believe that it will be politically possible to refrain, in due course, from publishing such an Index.    It will be apparent from the termsof the draft statement (Annex A to CP. (56) 66) that people in this categoryare excluded from the calculations on which the Index of Retail Prices isbased, and that the information on which a separate Index covering them could be prepared is, in fact, in possession of the Government.    If suchan Index is not published the charge will be made that we are suppressingit because its results are embarrassing.3.      My colleagues will be aware that for some time there has been considerable pressure for the publication of such an Index.     This was apparent during the debate last December on the new National Assistancescales and was strongly pressed by Mr. Douglas Houghton, M.P.Mr. Mikardo, M.P. has, in fact, constructed an index of his own whichis not widely different from that already in private use by the assistance board.     The Old Age Pensioners&apos; Association and other pressure groupsdecline to accept even the present Index as giving any answer to their claims, and will of course be in an even stronger position to disregard the new one which expressly excludes their members from its calculations.4.      My particular concern with this matter is in connection with assistance scales.     The futrre levels of National Insurance benefits willbe determined by broader considerations (how far, for example, they areto be regarded as subsistence payments, the acceptable level of contribu-tions, and the like).    But National Assistance is explicitly a subsistencepayment.    It will be clear that the new Retail Prices Index is quiteirrelevant to subsistence.     And it is, as mentioned above,  a fact thatthe Assistance Board do maintain for their own purposes a private indexalong these lines.5.      I have discussed the matter with the Board and understand from themthat refusal of a demand to publish would be more likely to embarrass them than would publication.COPY NO1. OO
6.      I appreciate the Minister of Labour&apos;s point that nothing avoidableshould be done to prejudice or confuse the position of the main Index inrelation to wage claims.    I think, however, that this point could be largely-met by publishing this low income Index in a different way and at differentand perhaps less frequent dates.    I would be glad to discuss that with him.7.      There are three courses open to us -(a) to decide, as the Minister of Labour suggests,neither to prepare nor publish a low incomeIndex;(b) to decide to publish and announce that this is going to be done at the same time as anannouncement is made about the main Index;(c) to make the necessary preparations for thepublication of a low income Index but to reserve the announcement about it until thedemand is made.0.      My own preference is for course (b),  since I think it looks better tooffer the Index than to risk having it dragged out of us.     But if, in deference to the Minister of Labour&apos;s views, my colleagues would prefer to follow course (c), I would not be seriously concerned provided that theannouncement could be made fairly quickly when the demand manifestsitself.    This would involve preparations being made to secure that the materials were to hand.    I do not think course (a) is politically tenable.It involves, in my view, the virtual certainty of publishing this index in circumstances in which it appears that we have tried to avoid doing so.9.      I would add that I see no reason why we should assume that publication of this separate Index would embarrass us in connection withthe scales of social service benefits.     The result may well be the reverse.J. A.D. -C.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,W.C.2.3rd March, 1956.
