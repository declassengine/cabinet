S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.C.P.(56) 63 COPY NO.  4 93rd March, 1956CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND PARLIAMENT:  DISQUALIFICATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsFollowing our discussion of 16th February (CM. (56) 15th Conclusions,Minute 1) on my memorandum C. F. (56) 39, I had regretfully to inform mycolleagues on 22nd February (CM. (56) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2) of two further instances of prima facie disqualification in the Northern ireland parliament.     These were discovered when the Northern Ireland authoritiesmade a further check at the request of my officials.     This was because it seemed possible that there might be either Members who had held but were no longer holding disqualifying offices;  or holders of disqualifying officeswho had been, but were no longer, Members.     There was a chance that either category might include persons who had incurred disqualificationsome time ago and would therefore need indemnification.2.      The two further cases thus discovered have now been investigated by Select Committees of the Northern Ireland Senate and House of Commons,whose reports are annexed.    The reports have been approved by therespective Houses, and Resolutions were passed on 29th February declaringSenator Fleming (who died on 29th February) and Doctor Nixon to have beenincapable of being returned.     The Resolutions also endorsed therecommendations of the Select Committees that representations should bemade to us, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government have been asked by the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland to introduce legislation to indemnify all six members and to validate their elections (save that of Senator Fleming).3.      I accordingly seek the approval of the Cabinet for -(l)  the legislation already authorised to be extendedso as to indemnify Senator Fleming andDoctor Nixon and to validate Doctor Nixon&apos;selection;(2)  the explanatory White Paper approved on16th February to be revised as at Annex Aand presented as soon as possible;(3)  the proposed statement by the Lord Privy seal to be revised as at Annex B.G. LL. -G.Home Office, S. W. 1.2nd March, 1956.
4.      Meanwhile, a further check was proceeding, and on 20th February-two additional cases were discovered.    The respective Houses were informed on 21st February and further Select Committees were set up on22nd February;  their reports of 28th February, which are also annexed,were considered on 29th February and the following further resolutions were passed:-The Senate&quot;That Henry Fleming Esquire, M. B. E. , J. P. , being returned as a Member of the Senate, having at the time ofhis election held an office of profit under the Crown, wasincapable of being returned as a Member of this House,and that this House agrees with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Select Committee on elections. &quot;The House of Commons&quot;That Robert Samuel Nixon Esquire, M. B. , being returned as a Member for North Down, having at the timeof his election held an office of profit under the Crown,was incapable of being returned as a Member of this house, and that this House agrees with the recommenda-tions contained in the Report of the Select Committee on elections. &quot;5.      The Parliament of Northern Ireland having no power to legislateon the subject of the qualifications and disqualifications of its Members, theGovernment of Northern Ireland have made representations to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom (as recommended by the select committees and agreed by the Senate and House of Commons of NorthernIreland) that indemnifying and validating legislation should be introduced at Westminster.6.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government have noted that only one of those concerneapplied for or received any remuneration from public funds in respect ofthe offices in question.    The exception was the late Senator Fleming, who,following his first election to the Senate on 25th October, 1945, receivedfees in respect of his services as a member of a Rent Tribunal.    In all,however, these amounted to only  20 16s. 2d. over a period of more than ten years.     This sum included  4 4s. covering two sittings of the Tribunalsince his re-election to the Senate on 22nd May, 1953.    Her majesty&apos;s government have also noted that the respective Select Committees were satisfied that none of the six disqualified Members realised the legalcomplexities involved.7.      In these circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decided tointroduce legislation at Westminster as soon as possible to indemnify thedisqualified Members against the penalties recoverable from them by common informer actions, and to validate their elections (save that ofSenator Fleming).
-ANNEX ADRAFT WHITE paper in their report of 12th July, 1955, on the cases of Mr. J.C. Georgeand Sir Roland Jennings, the House of Commons Select Committee on elections -&quot;noted the fortuitous way in which the cases they have considered have been brought to notice.     They cannotoverlook the possibility that there may be, amongstpresent Members of the House of Commons, some who might be found to have unexpected technical disabilities.They consider that all Government Departments should at once examine their lists of public appointments in orderto determine whether there may be other Members who should be warned that there may be doubt about the validity of their election. &quot;   (House of Commons (1955) No. 3 5,paragraph 11. )2.      Pursuant to this recommendation, Treasury Circulars were sent toall United Kingdom Government Departments requesting them to examinethe lists of public appointments within their jurisdiction and to verify thatthese did not include the names of any Members of the House of commons at Westminster or of the Northern Ireland Senate or House of Commons.No fresh cases of disqualification in this country were disclosed by this enquiry, but as a result of a similar check carried out by the Governmentof Northern Ireland it was discovered that four Members of the NorthernIreland House of Commons (including the then Speaker) and two Senatorsmight be disqualified.3.      The Senate was recalled on 17th January, 1956, to enable a statement to be made by the prime Minister about four cases which had alreadycome to light.    Both the Senate and the House of Commons then appointedSelect Committees to consider the position of their Members.     The select committees reported on 7th February, and copies of their reports areannexed;   these were considered by the respective Houses on 8th February,whereupon the following Resolutions were passed:-The Senate&quot;That Lit. -Col. H0S.C. Richardson being returned asa Member of the Senate, having at the time of his electionheld an office of profit under the Crown, was incapable ofbeing returned as a Member of this House, and that this house agrees with the recommendations contained in theReport of the Select Committee on Elections. &quot;The House of Commons&quot;That Capt. the Rt. Hon. Sir Norman Stronge, Bart. ,being returned as a Member for Mid-Armagh,the Rt. Hon. Sir William McCleery, being returned as aMember for North Antrim, and Dr. Eileen Hickey, being returned as a Member for Queen&apos;s University, having atthe time of their election held certain offices of profit under the Crown, were incapable of being returned as members of this House, and that this House agrees withthe recommendations contained in the Report of the SelectCommittee on Elections. &quot;
ANNEX draft STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE OF commons I have to inform the House that following the receipt of representa-tions from the Government of Northern Ireland concerning the disqualifica-tion of four Members of the Northern Ireland House of Commons (includingthe former Speaker) and two Senators, Her Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided to introduce legislation as soon as possible to indemnify all those concerned against common informer penalties.    I regret to say thatSenator Fleming died on 28th February and I should like to express the sympathy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and of the House with hisrelatives.    The proposed Bill will validate the elections of the otherfive disqualified Members.2.      Legislation at Westminster is necessary because the Parliamentof Northern Ireland has no power, to legislate on the subject of the qualifications and disqualifications of its Members.3.      The facts are being laid before Parliament in the form of a white paper, copies of which are now available to hon. Members in the VoteOffice,     The White Paper incorporates the Reports of Select committees of the Northern Ireland House of Commons and Senate and also the texts of Resolutions passed by the two Houses declaring the disqualifiedMembers to have been incapable of being returned and proposing thatrepresentations should be made to Her Majestyrs Government.

F. Stout, Esq., Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs.J. A. Sinton, Esq., M.B., Medical Doctor in attendance on SenatorFleming.Consideration and Adoption of the Draft Report.
REPORTYour Committee, appointed to consider whether the election of thefollowing Senator, that is to say: Henry Fleming, Esq., M.B.E., J.P.is invalid on the ground that at the time of his election he held an office or place of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section 24 of the succession to the Crown Act, 1707: and to report whether such Senatorappears on that account to have been incapable of election to this House,and, if so, what representations should be made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the matters to them referred and have agreed to thefollowing Report:-Your Committee met and have considered a memorandum from the attorney-General, who was unable to be present owing to illness, and have examined Mr. W. F. Stout, Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs,and Dr. J. A. Sinton; but were unable to call Senator Fleming as a witness,or to ask a quorum of the Committee to visit him, Owing to a severe and prolonged illness.Memoranda were submitted by the Attorney-General and the Ministryof Home Affairs.Your Committee are advised that the law on the subject of Disqualifica-tion may be summed up as follows:Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, provides that no person having an office of profit under the Crown shall be capable of being elected, or of sitting or voting as a Member of the House of Commons.In 1793 the Irish Parliament passed the House of Commons Disqualifica-tion Act (Ireland), 1793. Section 1 of such Act imposed a similar disqualifica-tion in respect of membership of the Irish House of Commons.The House of Commons (Disqualification) Act, 1801, Section 1, pro-vided that all persons disabled from or incapable of being elected, sittingor voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of Great britain should be disqualified from being elected or sitting or voting in the Houseof Commons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as Member forGreat Britain. Section 2 provided similarly that all persons disqualified from being elected, sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliamentof Ireland should be disqualified from being elected, sitting or voting in theHouse of Commons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as members for Ireland. Section 3 provided that persons disqualified by British Statutesshould not be enabled to sit and vote in the House of Commons of the parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Ireland, nor shouldpersons disqualified by Acts of the Parliament of Ireland be enabled to sitor vote in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members forGreat Britain.Section 18 (2) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, applied the lawfor the time being in force relating to the qualification and disqualification
of Members of the Commons House of Parliament of the United kingdom to the Members of the Senate and House of Commons of Northern Ireland.Your Committee find that Senator Fleming was first appointed by theGovernor of Northern Ireland as a member of a Rents Tribunal on the 10thJanuary, 1944, by a Warrant given under the hand of His Grace the Duke ofAbercorn the then Governor of Northern Ireland and was re-appointedeach year until 1956, but was not re-appointed for 1956 owing to illness.Copies of the Warrants of Appointment are attached in the Appendix.The Excessive Rents (Prevention) Act (Northern Ireland), 1941, pro-vides for the setting up of Rents Tribunals to which persons occupyingdwelling-houses let after the 1st day of September, 1939, can, if they areaggrieved by the amount of rent being charged, apply for a determinationas to whether the rent payable is fair and reasonable. The Rents Tribunals(Extension of Jurisdiction) Act (Northern Ireland), 1954, extends the powersof Rents Tribunals and gives landlords a right to apply in certain cases.Members of the Tribunals are appointed by the Governor of NorthernIreland under the provisions of Section 2 of the Act of 1941.Section 3 (2) of the Excessive Rents (Prevention) Act, 1941, provides thatthey shall be paid to the members of each tribunal such remuneration(whether by way of salaries or by way of fees) and such alowances as theMinistry of Home Affairs, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, may determine.Your Committee find that Senator Fleming was elected to the Senateon the 25th October, 1945, and was re-elected on the 22nd May, 1953.Your Committee deeply regret that owing to a prolonged and severeillness, to which fact Dr. Sinton has given evidence, it has been impossibleeither to call Senator Fleming to give evidence before the Committee, orfor a quorum of the Committee to visit Senator Fleming at his residencefor the purpose of obtaining a statement from him. Your Committee there-fore have had to depend upon the documentary evidence submitted by theMinistry of Home Affairs.From this evidence it is clear that Senator Fleming was appointed onthe 10th January, 1944, by a Warrant issued under the hand of the governor of Northern Ireland, as a member of the Rents Tribunal set up under the excessive Rents (Prevention) Act (Northern Ireland), 1941, and was lastre-appointed on the 29th December, 1954, in respect of the year ended on31st December, 1955. During the entire period he has received the sum of 20 16s. 2d. by way of fees as a member of the Rents Tribunal, of whichsum  4 4s. relates to the period since his re-election to the Senate on the22nd May, 1953.Your Committee understand that Senator Fleming was appointed amember of the tribunal as representing the interests of tenants and wasselected by virtue of being a trade unionist and a member of the Boilermakers&apos;Union.The Attorney-General&apos;s considered opinion, as stated in his memo-randum, is that as Senator Fleming was appointed a member of the RentsTribunal under the 1941 Act, this appointment was, in his opinion, an officeof profit under the Crown within Section 24 of the 1707 Act.
Your Committee, having carefully considered all the documentary evi-dence submitted, and the evidence given by Mr. Stout, Assistant Secretary,Ministry of Home Affairs, are satisfied that Senator Fleming was appointed a member of a Rents Tribunal under the 1941 Act, and that during part ofthe time of his membership he was also a Member of the Senate.Your Committee are satisfied that membership of this Rents Tribunalconstitutes an office of profit under the Crown within the meaning of the relevant Statute.Your Committee, in view of the considered opinion of the Attorney-General, are satisfied that at the time of Senator Fleming&apos;s election andre-election to the Senate he held an office of profit under the Crown and thathis election was therefore invalid.Your Committee believe that Senator Fleming acted in all good faithunder a sense of public duty and that he had no knowledge of the legalcomplexities involved and that at no time was his attention called to thefact that his membership of the Rents Tribunal might disqualify him fromsitting or voting as a Senator. Senator Fleming, as the medical evidenceproves, has been unable to attend the Senate and at the present time is quiteincapable of making any statement regarding his position either as a memberof the tribunal or as a Senator.In view of these facts your Committee recommend that representationsshould be made immediately to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce legis-lation to indemnify Senator Fleming and validate his election.
oMINUTES OF EVIDENCEFRIDAY, 24th FEBRUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Friday, 24th February, 1956.There were present: Mrs. Greeves, M.B.E., Sir Wilson Hungerford, Mr.Pollock, and Dr. Quin, C.B.E., LL.D.Dr. Quin: I propose that Sir WilsonHungerford take the Chair.Agreed.The Chairman: Thank you. We allthought when we last met in regard to thesematters that we had come to the end ofour labours. However, as you know anothercase has been submitted and it is necessaryfor us to carry out the instructions of theHouse and to investigate the position of Mr.Henry Fleming.The Secretary (Major Thomson): Therewas a telephone call from the Attorney-General (Mr. Edmond Warnock) whoregrets that he cannot attend the Com-mittee this morning. He is in bed with a very severe cold and a high temperature. He has,however, sent me a memorandum giving hisopinion on this particular case, and with your permission I will read it to theCommittee.The Chairman: Please read it.The memorandum was as follows:A few weeks ago, when I gave evi-dence before the Select Committee, Isubmitted a rather lengthy memorandumon the subject of disqualification, and 1then drew attention to certain precedentswhich I thought should guide the Com-mittee in coming to a conclusion in thecase then under consideration. That me-morandum is readily available and I neednot repeat to-day what I said then.Mr. H. Fleming was appointed a mem-ber of a rents tribunal in April, 1944.He was not, at that time, a Member ofthe Senate. His first election took placeon 25th October, 1945, and he was re-elected on 22nd May, 1953. I am in-formed by the Ministry of Home affairs that since the date of his re-election Mr.Fleming has sat as a member of thistribunal on two occasions only, namely,3rd June, 1954, and 27th August, 1954,and that in. respect of each of these sit-tings he was paid a fee of  2. 2s Od,making  4 4s Qd in all. Between the dateof his first election and his re-election inMay, 1953, Mr. Fleming sat occasionallyon this tribunal and received payments inthis period amounting to  16 12s 2d,thus making a total of  20 16s 2d overa period of ten years.The tribunal, of which Mr. Flemingwas a member, was constituted under the excessive Rents (Prevention) Act (Nor-thern Ireland), 1941. Section 2 of theAct provided that for the purpose of determining questions under the Act thereshould be constituted such number of rent tribunals as the Minister of HomeAffairs might determine. The members are appointed by the Governor of Nor-thern Ireland.Section 3 (2) provides that there shallbe paid to the members of each tribunalsuch remuneration (whether by way of salaries or by way of fees) and suchallowances as the Ministry of HomeAffairs with the approval of the Ministryof Finance may determine and the ex-penses of the tribunal, including such remuneration and allowances shall be defrayed out of monies provided byParliament.In these circumstances I would express the opinion that at the date of Mr.Fleming&apos;s re-election to the Senate on22nd May, 1953, he held an office, heldit under the Crown and that it was an office of profit. Mr. Fleming&apos;s appoint-ment expired on 31st December, 1955,and having regard to the state of his health I understand that he did not wishto be re-appointed.Mr.  Fleming  is,   at   present,  gravelyill,  and  is  quite, unable to attend  tocorrespondence or to business and it isquite impossible for him to attend themeeting  of  this Committee,  or  to  beinterviewed at his own home. If this isproved to your satisfaction by the evi-dence of his doctor I think the Committeewill be justified in coming to a decision without  hearing  Mr.  Fleming,  subject always to this, that the Committee should require every fact to be proved strictly.The Chairman: The Attorney-General hasset out the position of Mr. Henry Flemingin a very clear manner. It is well knownto Members of the Committee that Mr.Fleming is ill and cannot attend before theCommittee. In order that the Committeeshould have no doubts in their minds as tothe illness of Mr. Fleming we have arranged that his doctor shall appear before us. Asthe Attorney-General has pointed out, theCommittee will require to have the factsproved. It will be necessary for us to haveevidence in regard to his appointment tothe tribunal concerned, and information asto whether or not he received the sumsmentioned by the Attorney-General.The Secretary: Mr. W. F. Stout. assistant secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, whodeals with these matters is available.Mr. W. F. Stout called.The Chairman: As you know, Mr. Stout,the validity of one of the Members of the
Senate is in question because it is thoughthe held an office of profit under the Crown.The case is that of Mr. Henry Fleming whowas a member of a rents tribunal. That is,if I may say so, one of your Departmentsbabies, and I should like to know are theCommittee justified in taking it that Mr.Fleming was a member of that tribunal.Mr. Stout: Yes. Mr. Henry Fleming wasappointed to a rents tribunal in 1944.The Chairman: May I interrupt you?You submitted a memorandum to the Com-mittee. If you read that it would help.Mr. Stout: Yes. The memorandum recitesthe statutory provision under which the rentstribunals are constituted. The memorandumreads as follows:The Excessive Rents (Prevention) Act(Northern Ireland), 1941, provides for the setting up of rents tribunals to which per-sons occupying dwelling-houses let afterthe 1st day of September, 1939, can, ifthey are aggrieved by the amount of rentbeing charged, apply for a determinationas to whether the rent payable is fair and reasonable. The Rents Tribunals (Exten-sion of Jurisdiction) Act (Northern Ire-land), 1954, extends the powers of RentsTribunals and gives landlords a right toapply in certain cases.Members of the Tribunals are appointedby the Governor of Northern Irelandunder the provisions of Section 2 of theAct of 1941. Mr. Henry Fleming, J.P.,was so appointed on 10th January, 1944,and was re-appointed each year until 1955.He was last appointed on the 29th Decem-ber, 1954, in respect of the year ended31st December, 1955. Copies of warrantsof appointment relating to Mr. Fleming&apos;first appointment and appointment for theyears 1954 and 1955 are attached.Section 3 (2) of the Excessive Rents(Prevention) Act, 1941, provides that thereshall be paid to the members of eachtribunal such remuneration whether byway of salaries or by way of fees andsuch allowances as the Ministry of HomeAffairs, with the approval of the Ministryof Finance, may determine.Since the date of Senator Fleming&apos;selection to the Senate-25th October, 1945 he has received the sum of  20 16s 2dby way of fees as a member of the rentstribunal, of which  4 4s relates to theperiod since his re-election to the Senateon 22nd May, 1953.The Chairman: That gives the facts thathe was on the tribunal and also that he received the fees.Dr. Quin: How were members of thesetribunals selected?Mr. Stout: Each tribunal consists, ofthree members, a chairman and two others.The chairman is a resident magistrate. Theother two members are selected, one torepresent owners&apos; interests and one torepresent tenants&apos; interests.In what capacity was Mr. Flemingappointed? On that tribunal Mr. Flemingwould represent the tenants&apos; interests.Dr. Quin: Was he appointed in that capacity by reason of his being a tradeunionist?The Chairman: I think I could probablyanswer that question. Mr. Fleming was amember of the Boilermakers&apos; Union, and Ican personally say that the Minister ofHome Affairs, who set up the rents tri-tribunals, was most anxious that representa-tives of the workers should sit on them. he felt that Mr. Fleming, whose interest in thecause of the workers was well-known, wouldbe an ideal person for that purpose, and accordingly he asked him to become a mem-ber of the tribunal, and Mr. Fleming con-sented. At the time of Mr. Fleming&apos;appointment he was working in the Belfastshipyard.Dr. Quin: Can Mr. Stout corroboratethat?Mr. Stout: I do not think we have all those details.Dr. Quin: How far can you go? Myreason for asking is that Mr. Stout is givingthe evidence.The Chairman: I happened to be Parlia-mentary Secretary of the Ministry of HomeAffairs at the time when these tribunalswere set up, and, as I said, the Minister was most anxious that representatives of theworkers should be appointed. I had theopportunity of investigating what positionsthese people held, and I can say quitedefinitely that Mr. Fleming was a memberof the Boilermakers&apos; Union.Dr. Quin: From the assurance you havegiven this Committee, and your generalknowledge of the subject, may we accept that as evidence?The Chairman: Whether it is evidence ornot, I am telling you the truth.Dr. Quin: You do not know of anything to the contrary, Mr. Stout?Mr. Stout: No, Sir, and the constitutionof the tribunal would support that view, asthe other member was Mr. DonaldMcCaughey, an estate agent.Mr. Pollock: As representative of theowners? ,Mr. Stout: Of the owners&apos;interests.Dr. Quin: I am rather anxious to have it clearly established as evidence that, infact, Mr. Fleming was representing a tradeunion interest.The Chairman: There, was nq. doubt about that, but Mr. Fleming was not theonly person: there were other . representa-tives of trade union interests also on the tribunals, for various parts of Ulster. Isthat not so, Mr. Stout?Mr. Stout: Yes.Dr. Quin: My reason for making the in-quiry is that on the question of remunerat-
ion it is only reasonable to expect that ashipyard worker such as Mr. Fleming, whowas a member of the Boilermakers&apos; Union,must be at a loss of income in respect oftime devoted to the work of the tribunal.The Chairman: Undoubtedly. As I have pointed out, Mr. Fleming was working inthe shipyard at the time of his appoint-ment, and if he left his work he would naturally lose his pay. You have vouchersfor the payments which were made, Mr.Stout?Mr. Stout: Yes, I have receipted payableorders.At any time did your Department informSenator Fleming that by virtue of acting on the tribunal he would be disqualified from sitting as a Member of the Senate? No, sir. It was not until Senator Fleminghad ceased to be a member of the tribunalthat it was realised he was, in fact, aSenator.Therefore at no time did he have any idea or inkling that by acting on the tri-bunal he was committing a breach ofParliamentary procedure? I should thinknot. Certainly he had nothing from theMinistry of Home Affairs.Dr. Quin: The Ministry of Home affairs was not aware on his re-appointment eachyear that he was not qualified to be aMember of the Senate by virtue of holdingthat office?Mr. Stout: It was not realised that Mr.Fleming, a member of the Antrim RentsTribunal, was one and the same person asSenator ^Fleming.The Chairman: That could happen quiteeasily, because he would only appear inyour records at the time his name came before the Department as H. Fleming, and,as has been pointed out, it was not until after he had been appointed on that tri-bunal that he was appointed a Memberof the Senate. He would have no way ofknowing and your Department did notrealise the position? Therefore no noticewas sent to him.Dr. Quin: They did not relate the Mem-ber of the Senate with the member of thetribunal?Mr. Stout: That is so.The Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Stout.Mr. Stout then withdrew.Dr. John A. Sinton called.The Chairman: I should like to thankyou very much indeed for coming to-day.We all know how busy doctors are, andparticularly at this time of the year, andi want you to feel that we sincerely appre-associate your finding time to come and give evidence. You have probably seen that this inquiry is about an office of profit under theCrown. Some people may think it trivial,but it happens to be one of the Parlia-mentary safeguards. This Committee, corn-posed of representatives of the Senate, was set up to inquire into the position of Mr.Henry Fleming, who is one of our Senatorsand who, we understand, was also a mem-ber of a tribunal from which he receivedsome money. We have regretted for a longtime his absence from the Senate throughillness. Naturally no Government Commit-tee would carry out an investigation intothe circumstances of anybody without having that person present. Our Parlia-mentary procedure requires that such an investigation should take place within Par-liament Buildings or, in a case where a per-son is ill, we can go to the Senate and askfor permission for the Committee to holda meeting in the person&apos;s home. Such a caseoccurred a short time ago with regard to colonel Richardson. I have no doubt, know-ing of Mr. Fleming&apos;s illness, that we could go and get the same permission from ourSenate to go and visit him in his home. Welearned with a great deal of regret that evenif we got that permission and went to visitMr. Fleming he would have great difficultyin following the course of our investigation.Dr. Sinton: That is correct.And furthermore, that a visit such as thatmight indeed be very detrimental to his health. So it was with those fears, and withthat position in mind, that the committee decided to ask you to come along and tellus what you feel the position really is. Theposition is that the old man is dying andI think that he will be dead within the next two or three days. He is semi-comatosedand it would be completely useless to talkto him. He would not understand. He isdying. It is a question of age, and that is all there is to it. I saw him yesterday justfor a check and there is nothing one can do. He is not even rational.Dr. Quin: I take it that he is not able to speak intelligently?Dr. Sinton: No, he is confused. You haveto shake him to get him to recognise you.He is simply an old man -finished.Any question that might be addressed tohim by this Committee would be fruitlessfrom the point of view of eliciting any in-formation? Absolutely. There is no doubt on that at all. He will probably be deadwithin the next couple of days; evenpossibly to-day. I think there is nothing more I can add.The Chairman: I am afraid there is nothing more we can ask you about thematter. We are very sorry naturally to learn that one of our colleagues is in sucha state. We are sorry to have brought youalong, but as I pointed out to you we must,in order to tell the House tjjiat we havelooked into the case, have your opinion.Dr. Sinton: Thank you very much for your courtesy.

oREPORTYour Committee, appointed to consider whether the election of thefollowing Member, that is to say:  Robert Samuel Nixon, Esq., M.D.is invalid on the ground that at the time of his election he held an office or place of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section 24 ofthe Succession to the Crown Act, 1707 ; and to report whether such Memberappears on that account to have been incapable of election to this House,ind, if so, what representations should be made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the matters to them referred and have agreed to the follow-ing Report:  Your Committee met and have examined the Attorney-General; Mr.H. Anderson and Mr. R. W. Steele, Assistant Secretaries, Ministry of Labourand National Insurance ; Mr. Joseph Ritchie, Clerk of the Crown for northern Ireland ; and the Member whose election to the House of Commonswas under consideration.Memoranda were submitted by the Attorney-General, and the Ministryof Labour and National Insurance.Your Committee are advised that the law on the subject of disqualification-eation may be summed up as follows:Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, provides that no person having an office of profit under the Crown shall be capable of being elected, or of sitting or voting as a Member of the House of Commons.In 1793 the Irish Parliament passed the House of Commons disqualification-cation Act (Ireland), 1793. Section 1 of this Act imposed a similardisqualification in respect of membership of the Irish House of Commons.The House of Commons (Disqualifications) Act, 1801, Section 1, providedthat all persons disabled from or incapable of being elected sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of Great Britain should be disqualified from being elected or sitting or voting in the House of commons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as a Member for Great Britain.Section 2 provided similarly that all persons disqualified from being elected,sitting or voting in the House of Commons of any Parliament of ireland should be disqualified from being elected, sitting or voting in the House ofCommons of any Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Ireland.Section 3 provided that persons disqualified by British Statutes should notbe enabled to sit and vote in the House of Commons of the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom as Members for Ireland, nor should persons disqualifiedby Acts of the Parliament of Ireland be enabled to sit or vote in the houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom as Members for Great Britain.Section 18(2) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, applied the lawfor the time being in force relating to the qualification and disqualificationof Members of the Commons House of Parliament of the United kingdom to the Members of the Senate and House of Commons of Northern Ireland.
Your Committee find that Dr. Nixon applied for appointment as anAppointed Factory Doctor under the Factories Acts (Northern Ireland),1938 and 1949, on the 29th April, 1952, and was duly appointed by theMinistry on the 24th May, 1952, under Section 132(1) of the Factories Act(Northern Ireland), 1938, and a letter notifying him of his appointment was sent to him on that day.The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance is empowered bySection 132 of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1938, as amended bySection 7 of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, to appoint asufficient number of duly qualified medical practitioners to be &quot; appointedfactory doctors &quot; for the purposes of those Acts. The main duties of anappointed factory doctor under the Acts are set out in Sections 73, 103 and132 of the Act of 1938, and an appointed factory doctor may also be calledupon to perform certain duties under the Lead Paint (Protection againstPoisoning) Act (Northern Ireland), 1927, and the Workmen&apos;s CompensationAct (Northern Ireland), 1927, which, though now repealed, is saved in thisrespect by Section 88 of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act(Northern Ireland), 1946.Section 133 of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1938, providesfor the payment to an appointed factory doctor(a) by the occupier of a factory, of fees prescribed by the ministry for the medical examination and certification of fitness of youngpersons for employment in that factory, and for any examination ormedical supervision of persons employed in it carried out in pur-suance of regulations or an order under the Act; and(b) as an expense of carrying the Act into effect, of fees determinedby the Ministry for the performance of any other duties under theAct (such duties, for instance, as are specified in Section 73).Your Committee find that Dr. Nixon was declared elected a Memberof Parliament for the North Down Constituency by the Returning officer on the 23rd October, 1953, and the return of the Writ was received bythe Clerk of the Crown on the 24th October, 1953, and he duly took his seat.Following Dr. Nixon&apos;s election as a Member of Parliament his attention was called to the fact that the holding of an appointment as an AppointedFactory Doctor might be open to some question, and accordingly on the29th October, 1953, Dr. Nixon, by letter to the Ministry, resigned his appointment, and his resignation was accepted by letter of the following day.The Attorney-General informed your Committee that he would feelconstrained by the authority of precedent to advise that if Dr. Nixon wasappointed an Appointed Factory Doctor of the Bangor District so that the fees payable under Section 133 of the Factories (Northern Ireland) Act,1938, as set out in the Order of the 15th September, 1947, became payable,then notwithstanding the fact that no such emoluments or fees were everpaid by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance to Dr. Nixon, theappointment was in his opinion an &quot; office of profit&quot; under the Crownwithin Section 24 of the 1707 Act.Your Committee, having carefully considered the evidence of Dr. Nixonand the other witnesses called, including that of the Attorney-General, aresatisfied that Dr. Nixon was appointed and acted as an Appointed FactoryDoctor and that during part of that period he was also a Member of theHouse of Commons.
Your Committee are also satisfied that this office constitutes an office of profit under the Crown within the meaning of the relevant Statute.Your Committee, in view of the advice of the Attorney-General concludetherefore that at the time of,his election to the House of Commons Dr. Nixonheld an office of profit under the Crown and that his election was thereforeinvalid.Your Committee are also satisfied that Dr. Nixon, when his attention was drawn to the fact that the holding of this appointment after his election to the House of Commons might be open to question, resigned his appoini-ment, but did not realise the legal complexities of the situation.Your Committee are also satisfied that while acting as an AppointedFactory Doctor Dr. Nixon did not at any time receive any fees or emolumentsfrom the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.Your Committee therefore recommend that representations should bemade immediately to Her Majesty&apos;s Governmnt to introduce the necessary legislation to indemnify Dr. Nixon and to validate his election.
MINUTES OF EVIDENCETHURSDAY, 23rd FEBRUARY, 1956The Elections Select Committee met in Room 17, Parliament Buildings,Stormont, on Thursday, 23rd February, 1956.There were present: Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Hawthorne, Captain Henderson,Mr. Irwin, Mr. J. W. Morgan, Mr. W. J. Morgan, and Mr. McConnell.The Attorney-General (Mr. Edmond Warnock, Q.C.); Mr. H. Anderson,Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Insurance; Mr. R. W.Steele, O.B.E., Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Insurance;and Mr. Joseph Ritchie, Clerk of the Crown for Northern Ireland, were in attendance.fees were to be paid by the occupier ofthe factory; and (b) in any other case hisfees were to be defrayed as an expense ofcarrying the Act into effect.In these circumstances I think an ap-pointed factory doctor held an office and held it under the Crown. I think, too, thatit was an office of profit whether or notits emoluments are derived either in whole or in part from sources other thanpublic funds. In support of my opinionI would call in aid the view expressed bySir Hartley Shawcross then Attorney-General speaking in the House of Com-mons on a 1949 Bill for the indemnifica-tion of certain Members. He stated:Provision is also made under the Con-stitution (of the General MedicalCouncil) that case related to certain Members whowere members of the General MedicalCouncil and had been elected to Parlia-ment for the payment of fees to the mem-bers of the Council and in practice,as I understand, they are in fact paid a sum of five guineas in respect ofeach attendance. They are paid, notout of State funds, not out of moniesprovided  by Parliament, but out ofmonies collected by the medical pro-fession from registration fees, but wedo not think that it is a criterion of whether or not an office is an office of profit under the Crown that the actualemoluments of it are derived from sources other than public funds.I draw attention to that because, as youwill see, under the 1938 Act a portion ofthe remuneration  was  drawn, if  it  was drawn at all, from sources other than public funds. I would respectfully agree with theview expressed by Sir Hartley.Dr. Nixon was returned to serve as aMember of Parliament for the constitu-ency of North Down. The result of the poll was announced by the returning officer. I am not quite sure of the date,but I think it was the 23rd October. I am not absolutely certain about that, but itis not very material really because thewrit was received by the Clerk of theThe Secretary (Major Thomson): As thisis a new Committee your first duty is toappoint a Chairman.Mr. J. W. Morgan: I have pleasure in proposing that Mr. McConneii take the chair.Mr. Faulkner:  I second that.Agreed.The Attorney-General called.The Chairman: Mr. Attorney-General,thank you for coming to assist us thismorning. Perhaps you would be kindenough to tell us something about yourresearches into this case.The AttorneyrGeneral: I will. I notice that the composition of this Select Com-mittee is the same as the Select committee before which I gave evidence quite recently.At that time the subject of disqualificationwas to most of us a new one, and I, there-fore, submitted a fairly long memorandum setting out the legal position, as I under-stood it. Since that memorandum is readily available, I need not repeat what I said then.Regrettably we are all better acquainted with the subject now. I have with meseveral copies of my memorandum whichI will hand in. (Copies handed to Members.&apos;)The memorandum reads as follows:  Dr. Robert S. Nixon was appointed bythe Ministry of Labour as an &quot;appointedfactory doctor&quot; for the Bangor district on24th May, 1952. The appointment wasmade under Section 132 of the FactoriesAct (Northern Ireland), 1938, as amended by Section 7 of the Factories Act (Nor-thern Ireland), 1949.Under the 1938 Act the person appointedwas called an &quot;examining surgeon,&quot; butthe 1949 Act changed the description tg&quot;appointed factory doctor.&quot; The dutiesremained substantially the same, and thesystem of remuneration was not altered.Section 133 of the Factories Act, 1938,provided for the payment of the doctorin two ways (a) In so far as his dutiesrelated to the examination or certificationwith respect to the fitness of a youngperson for employment in a factory, his
Crown on the forenoon of the 24thOctober, 1953.Dr. Nixon resigned his appointment bya letter dated 29th October, 1953, andhis resignation was accepted in a letterfrom the Ministry dated 30th October,1953. He was sworn in as a Member ofthe House of Commons on the 9thNovember, 1953, so you will see his resignation was some little time before being sworn in.In these circumstances I must give myopinion that at the date of his electionDr. Nixon held an office of profit underthe Crown, and that his election as aMember of the House of Commons wasinvalid.I have referred above to payment &quot;inany other case.&quot; Not because I think it ismaterial, but merely as explanatory Ishould state that Dr. Nixon&apos;s appointmentrendered him liable to perform certainduties under the Lead Paint (protection against Poisoning) Act, 1927, and theWorkmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1927, assaved by Section 88 of the National Iii-surance (Industrial Injuries) Act, .1946. Iam informed, and you will have evidence on this matter, that no payments in re-spect of fees or expenses were made to dr. Nixon by the Ministry for the per-forrhance of duties as an appointed fac-tory doctor during his tenure of that position.I am, of course, at the service of theCommittee to answer any questions theymay wish to put to me. I have tried tocover the ground as succinctly as possiblein this statement.The Chairman: Are there any questions that any Member of the Committee wishes to put to the learned Attorney-General?Mr. J. W. Morgan: Was Dr. Nixon amember of the General Medical Council?Mr. Irwin: No, no.Mr. Faulkner: There is one question Ishould like to ask the Attorney-General.When it was brought to our notice a fewweeks ago that three Members of the Houseof Commons might be disqualified why was it that Dr. Nixon&apos;s name was not brought before us at that time? Is there an essential difference between his case and that ^f the others?The Attorney-General: I think there is.The first inquiry related to present Mem-bers of Parliament who were presently hbld-ing office. That was the first inquiry, and itwas on that inquiry that the cases of SirNorman Stronge, Sir William McCleery and dr. Hickey were considered. When thesematters were discovered a further investiga-tion was made; and it was in the light ofthe further investigation that this particular case, and another case, came to light. Butthe first investigation related to personswho were presently Members of parliament and who were presently holding office. I donot conduct these investigations, Mr.Faulkner. I am not concerned in the in-investigation.    When anything transpires  it comes to me, but I do not personally directany investigation unless a matter comes tomy personal notice and then I must directinvestigation. These things came to me;they did not emanate from me.The Chairman: I take it from what you have told us that the crucial date was whenthe writ was received by the clerk of thecrown and peace?The Attorney-General: Either that or theresult of the poll, but, again, it is notmaterial. The returning officer declaring theresult of the poll is an administrative act.My own view is that the 23rd of Octoberis the material date, but if it is not thematerial date the 24th is certainly thematerial date, and it does not matter in this case which of the two days it is, because,in my view, Dr. Nixon is wrong no matter which of the two days it is.Mr. A W. Morgan: He actually becomes a Member of Parliament when he is swornin?The Attorney-General: Oh no. one member of this House has never beensworn in although he was elected at theGeneral Election of 1953. No, I think hebecomes a Member of Parliament either onthe declaration of the result of the poll bythe returning officer, or when the clerk ofthe crown and peace receives the return ofthe writ, one or other, and my own view isthat the declaration of the poll is thematerial date. I would have no hesitation in saying that the date of his swearing inis not the date he becomes a Member ofParliament.Mr. Irwin: I think it was stated by Dr.Nixon in a newspaper that he received nomoney under this appointment?The Attorney-General: I am not in aposition either to confirm or deny that. Iam told by the Ministry that he never re-ceived any money from them.The Chairman: Is that everything onwhich we want the Attorney-General s help?The Committee indicated assent.The Chairman: Thank you very much,Mr. Attorney-General.The Attorney-General: If any difficultyarises I shall be readily available.The Attorney-General then withdrew.Mr. Anderson and Mr. Steele called.The Chairman: Mr. Anderson, I under-stand you have a memorandum on the sub-ject of Dr. Nixon, and perhaps you wouldbe good enough to read it to the Com-mittee.Mr. Anderson: Very good, Mr. Chair-man.The following memorandum by the Minis-try of Labour and National Insurance was read by Mr. Anderson:The Ministry of Labour and national insurance is empowered by Section 132of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland),1938, as amended by Section 7 of the factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, to
appoint a sufficient number of dulyqualified medical practitioners to be&quot;appointed factory doctors&quot; for the pur-poses of those Acts. The main duties ofan appointed factory doctor under theActs are set out in Sections 73, 103 and132 of the Act of 1938, and an appointedfactory doctor may also be called uponto perform certain duties under the LeadPaint (Protection against Poisoning) Act(Northern Ireland), 1927, and the Work-men^ Compensation Act (Northern Ire-land), 1927, which, though now repealed,is saved in this respect by Section 88 ofthe National Insurance (Industrial In-juries) Act (Northern Ireland), 1946.Section 133 of the Factories Act (Nor-thern Ireland), 1938, provides for thepayment to an appointed factory doctor (a) by the occupier of a factory, of feesprescribed by the Ministry for the medical examination and certification of fitnessof young persons for employment in thatfactory, and for any examination ormedical supervision of persons employedin it carried out in pursuance of regula-tions or an order under the Act; and(b) as an expense of carrying the Act intoeffect, of fees determined by the ministry for the performance of any other duties under the Act (such duties, for instance,as are specified in Section 73).Dr. Robert S. Nixon was appointed bythe Ministry on the 24th May, 1952, to bean appointed factory doctor for theBangor district under Section 132(1) .ofthe Factories Act (Northern Ireland),1938, and a letter notifying him of his appointment was sent to him by theMinistry on that day. Following Dr.Nixon&apos;s election as a Member of Parlia-ment an officer of the Ministry suggested to him on the telephone that the pro-priety of his holding an appointment asan appointed factory doctor now that hewas a Member of Parliament might beopen to question. A copy of a statement by the officer concerned is attached. Dr.Nixon resigned his appointment by aletter dated the 29th October, 1953, and acceptance of his resignation was notified to him by the Ministry in a letter dated30th October, 1953.Copies of Dr. Nixon&apos;s application for appointment, of the minute appointinghim, and of the Ministry&apos;s letter notify-ing him of his appointment are attached,together with copies of his letter of resignation and the Ministry&apos;s acceptanceof it. Particulars of the fees payable toan appointed factory doctor by an employer and by the Ministry will befound in appendix C to the Ministry&apos;instructions for the guidance of factorydoctors of which a copy was enclosedwith the Ministry&apos;s letter of 24th May,1952, to Dr. Nixon.No payments in respect of fees orexpenses were made to Dr. Nixon by theMinistry for the performance of duties asan appointed factory doctor during histenure of that office.The Chairman: Does Mr. Steele wish to add anything to that?Mr. Anderson: Would the Committee likeme to read Mr. Steele&apos;s statement?The Chairman: Yes, it would be as well to have it in.The following note by Mr. Steele was read by Mr. Anderson:As regards Dr. Black&apos;s minute of 29thOctober, 1953, my recollection is that,on the date mentioned, Dr. Black, ChiefInspector of Factories, brought to mynotice that Dr. Nixon had been electeda Member of Parliament for North Downand was an appointed factory doctor.Dr. Black asked whether the department was required to take any action. I re-plied to the effect that I thought it oughtto be brought to Dr. Nixon&apos;s notice thathe might be putting himself in a difficult position and said that if Dr. Black wouldwait, we would try to get Dr. Nixon onthe &apos;phone.We got him on the &apos;phone and I toldDr. Nixon who I was and said that ithad been brought to my notice that hewas an appointed factory doctor and,whilst the Department would not presumeto give him advice, I thought it would only be right to tell him that he might find himself in serious difficulties if, now that he was a Member of Parliament, he still continued to hold his appointment as an appointed factory doctor. Dr.Nixon then asked what he should do,and I said that I could not be sure of thelegal position and could not advise him.I was merely telling him in a friendlyway that it might be necessary for himto consider how he stood. Dr. Nixonasked if he should resign the factorydoctor appointment and I said that thatwas really a matter for him. He ended upby saying that that seemed the best thing to do and that he would send in a letterof resignation that night.As this happened over two years agoI cannot at this stage be quite certain ofthe facts, but the foregoing statement ismy recollection of what took place. AsDr. Black is in London at the moment Ihave not been able to ask him what hisrecollection of the matter is.Mr. J. W. Morgan:  I think it showedgood faith on Dr. Nixon&apos;s part when heresigned immediately.The Chairman: We also have the corres-pondence attached to your memorandum,Mr. Anderson, but I do not think you needread it out.Mr. Irwin:  Mr. Anderson has told us that Dr. Nixon received no fees from theMinistry?Mr. Anderson: That is correct: not fromthe Ministry.Could he have received fees? Oh yes,he could have. He might have been called on to perform certain duties for which, if
he had performed them, he would havebeen entitled to fees from the Ministry.From the Ministry? From the Ministry,yes.The Chairman: In other words, thereason for the non-payment of fees wasthat he never carried out the functions which would have entitled him to suchfees?Mr. Anderson: He never carried out theparticular duties which would have at-tracted fees from the Ministry.The Chairman: Is there anything else,gentlemen?Mr. Morgan: The fact remains that he never received fees.Captain Henderson: I take it that Dr.Nixon was aware at the time of his ap-pointment of the conditions and that hewas, in fact, able to draw fees?Mr. Anderson: Oh yes. He got a copyof these instructions. Appendix C sets outthe fees payable. There are fees payable by the employers of the factory.The Secretary: You will see the scale of fees on page 17 of these instructions.The Chairman: We have before us thisbooklet, N.I.723, which relates to &quot;appointed-ted Factory Doctors.&quot; Was that, in fact,sent to Dr. Nixon on appointment?Mr. Anderson: Yes, with the letter noti-fying him of his appointment.So that he received that booklet setting out the functions and payment and so forth? Yes. I may say that the amountof fees paid by the Ministry to factorydoctors, generally, is negligible. In thecurrent financial year we have made no payment at all; in the previous financialyear I think we paid 23s. 6d., and in thefinancial year 1953-54 we paid 44s. 6d.So payment would be mostly from the factories themselves? From the employers for examination of young persons as totheir fitness.Mr. Faulkner: The main thing from Mr.Anderson&apos;s evidence and Mr. Steele&apos;s state-ment is that immediately this was broughtto Dr. Nixon&apos;s notice he resigned the office by return of post.Mr, Anderson: Yes.The Chairman: If that is everything Iwould thank Mr. Anderson and Mr. Steelefor being so kind as to assist us.Mr. Anderson and Mr. Steele then with-drewMr. Joseph Ritchie called.The^ Chairman: Thank you for coming to assist us, Mr. Ritchie. I believe you have got the writ returning Dr. Nixon as Memberof Parliament for North Down?Mr. Ritchie: Yes, Sir. (Writ handed in.)The return is on the back.The Chairman: Yes.Mr. Morgan: What is the actual date?The Chairman: Have you a copy before you, Mr. Ritchie?Mr. Ritchie: Yes, Sir.Looking at this writ, is it true to say thatthe date of return is the 23rd October, 1953?_Yes.Which is the date at the bottom?-That isthe date on which Dr. Nixon was declaredelected by the returning officer.Is the date of the return of the writ toyou as Clerk of the Crown stamped the 24thOctober? That is the date I received fromthe returning officer. The reason for thatdate is that the time for an Election Petitionruns from the date I receive it. If there hadbeen an Election Petition the six weekswould have run from the date I received it.Mr. Morgan: That would be the 24th,Mr. Ritchie?Mr. Ritchie: Yes.The Secretary: What happens is that a certified copy of this writ is sent up to me by Mr. Ritchie as soon as he has received it.We got a certified copy which I have at themoment. As a matter of fact, I think thetime was 10.15 on the 24th.Mr. Ritchie: I do not know whether theCommittee would like to know the machin-ery. I have brought with me the Governor^Proclamation dissolving the former Parlia-ment. On receipt of that I am directed toissue writs for the new Parliament, and Dr.Nixon&apos;s writ was issued pursuant to the warrant and direction.The Chairman: For our purposes the vital question is the date On which Dr.Nixon was returned as a Member of Parlia-ment. From the writ which you have shownus would the 24th be the vital date? It is either the 23rd or 24th.Mr. Ritchie: I have not looked into thelaw as I was not aware that was a point at issue. It might well be that a Membermight be returned as soon as the returning officer declares him to be elected.It is quite apparent that he was returnedeither on the 23rd or 24th. In other words,on the 23rd the returning officer declaredhim elected, and you received the writ onthe 24th October? That is right.The Chairman: Is there anything elsethat any Member would like to know fromMr. Ritchie? Thank you very much indeedfor your attendance, Mr. Ritchie.Mr. Ritchie then withdrew.gjii2     Dr. R. S. Nixon called.The Chairman: We have heard evidence from the Attorney-General and from theMinistry of Labour and National Insurance.The Ministry have also given us a memor-anduna and some documents, and have told us that on the 29th April, 1952, you appliedto the Ministry on a form under the factories Act for appointment as a factorydoctor. Is that correct?Dr. Nixon: Yes, I believe so.You did in fact apply at some time, but you may not remember the date? There isno doubt about that.
And you were appointed on the 24thMay, and on that date, the 24th May, theMinistry sent you a letter saying that you had been appointed and setting out somedetails about the appointment. They alsosent you a booklet giving information aboutthe duties and the remuneration ofappointed factory doctors I quite believethat.And is it true to say that you did not infact receive any payment in respect of thisappointment? It is true to say that I re-ceived no payment from the Ministry ofLabour for this appointment.Did you in fact receive it from theemployers? -It is true to say that payments were received as a result of my medical examination of juveniles. The money wasgiven to me by the juveniles.By the persons who were in factexamined? By the persons who came tomy private surgery for examination by measures a doctor.Mr. J. W. Morgan: But you did not receive any payment from the Ministry?Dr. Nixon: Oh no.The Chairman: And did you receivethis payment from the juveniles before yourelection?Dr. Nixon: I believe that to be true.It is only a few days? Yes, I believe itto be true that no juveniles came to me orto my partners for examination subsequent to my election.That would be between the 23rd or 24thof October and the date of your resignation,which was the 29th? Yes. Although I saythat that can be checked by a roll whichthe Ministry would have in its possession,because I would say on a form that Miss or mr. X was examined by me, and was foundfree from any organic or mental diseasewhich would prevent him or her from doinghis or her work in industry on account ofhis or her age. It was preventive medicine,if you understand it, which is my speciality.Mr. Faulkner: Is it right to say that your examination of juveniles always tookplace at your surgery and never at anemployees premises?Dr. Nixon: I would believe that is so,although it could happen sometimes thatthere might be one or two in a small place,and they would say, &quot;Would you go?&quot;, butI have no recollection of going to an in-dustrial establishment to examine cases. Itwas always done in my private surgery.The Chairman: We have got a copy ofa letter dated the 29th of October, 1953,written by you to the Ministry, in which you say:In view of my election as Member ofParliament for North Down, I wish to relinquish my post as factory doctor forBangor, under the Factories Act.You did in fact send that letter?Dr. Nixon:  I did not send that letter.I wrote that letter on the suggestion of aMinistry of Labour official who came tome and said, in this building, &quot;Doctor, youare a factory doctor. I believe that you should resign from it,&quot; and I did so im-mediately he said it. I believe I went withhim to his office and did it at the office.Captain Henderson: You signed theletter?Dr. Nixon: I most certainly did. i thought that there might be some con-fusion that I had written it at my home.I did not.The Chairman: You did send the letter?Dr. Nixon: I wrote the letter in an office in this building.But you signed the letter? That is right;I signed the letter.And when the matter had been broughtto your attention by the official of theMinistry, and when you had signed this letter and the letter had then been delivered to the Ministry, did you consider that therewere any further complications with regardto your membership of Parliament? I didnot.What did you think then was the yosi-tion? I thought that it was a Ministryofficial doing his duty as he saw it, andhaving knowledge that I had not got, andthat it was the correct thing to do, and I did it.Did you then think that your position asa Member of Parliament was regularised? I did not. I did not think my position wasirregular.I think you misunderstand. After you had signed that letter did you think thatas regards being a Member of Parliamentyou were in a regular position? That Iwas in a regular what? Would you repeat the question, because it might be impor-tant?After you had signed the letter and re-signed as a factory doctor, jn your ownmind did you think that you were quitevalid and regular in your position as aMember of Parliament? Because I signedthat letter in the Ministry&apos;s room here hadno effect one way or another on my mind,because prior to signing the letter I had given the position no thought whatever;and having signed it I regarded it as aroutine thing that had been done by theMinistry official. I did not approve or dis-approve ,of doing it, and I did not take into my consideration the effect of thatletter.Captain Henderson: What you are reallytrying to tell us is that you were satisfiedthat you were correct in following thesuggestion, and tfhat your position was quite clear?Dr. Nixon: Yes. The way you put thatpleases me. I was satisfied that the officialhad done right, and I accepted his decisionon that thing.The Chairman: In fact, this whole con-versation with the official, and the&apos;writing of the letter did not even raise in your
mind the question of invalidity as regardsyour membership of Parliament?,Dr. Nixon: That is absolutely true.The Chairman: Is there anything elseany member of the Committee wants toknow from Dr. Nixon?Mr. J. W. Morgan: He has given us proof of the fact that he acted in good faith.Mr. Faulkner: Dr. Nixon has declaredquite clearly that, having sent that letterto the Ministry of Labour, he consideredhe was free of all complications so far asbeing a Member of Parliament was con-cerned.Dr. Nixon: Yes, but the mere sending of that letter had no effect on my mind:I want you to be clear on that, and havingsigned it it meant nothing to me.Captain Henderson: In other words, itwas a matter of routine?Dr. Nixon: Yes. I felt no change. I didnot feel as if I had been^saved, or anything like that. I was still the same person.The Chairman: The question before usto-day never entered your mind at any period before the time when it first came to your notice?Dr. Nixon: Quite.And I take it that when recently you were informed of these difficulties you re-frained from attending the House? I didindeed. The Law Officer instructed me to stay away from Stormont and, secondly, togo to no public meetings whereby it mightbe regarded that I was, or I might purportto be, a Member of Parliament.You have followed that?-1 have fol-lowed that. I have written to nobody and attended no meetings since that.The Chairman: Unless there is anything else in anyone&apos;s mind I think that is all.Dr. Nixon: Might I say something toyou?The Chairman:   Yes.Dr. Nixon: I should like to say this,that an office of profit under the crown to me now might connote a payment madeto me by the Crown or by an agent ofthe Crown, or a payment would be impliedto me to come from the Crown, or ex-penses of any sort. I know that you area learned Member of the House and as a doctor I put to you what the implications of an office of profit under the Crown noware to me, and I should like if you and your Committee could consider that. Thereis in the Daily Mail this morning a head-line, &quot;Held office of profit for five days.&quot;The Daily Mail has made that statement,which you may have read. They have pre-judged your Committee&apos;s decision. I havebeen a doctor practising for 20 years, andI should like to point out to you and your committee that it is quite possible thatthere would be an area in the North ofIreland where the only person capable of becoming a factory doctor might be theonly doctor in that area. My speciality ispreventive medicine and this work was done by me as a doctor. In our profes-sion, after qualifying, we can go into her majesty&apos;s Forces under the Crown, or theCivil Service, or the local health services,or into private practice. It was as a privatepractitioner that this was done. Somebodyhad to do it. I come back to my originalstatement, that it was a job that had tobe done by some practitioner. Although itis probably not in your terms of reference,I think it might be considered whatan office of profit means and what it is considered to be meant by me that payment should be made by theCrown or the Crown agent, or expenses;or a condition might arise whereby I couldapply to the Crown. I do not think thatarose at any time in the position I had.The Chairman: You can be satisfied thatwe will take all you .have said into full consideration. Also, it is probably unneces-sary to say that we will not be influenced by anything that is published in any organoutside.Mr. Faulkner: We will be guided by theLaw Officers of the Crown.Dr. Nixon then withdrew.The Committee proceeded to consider theDraft Report, and concluded their delibera-tions.
APPENDIX &quot; A &quot;Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour and national insurance the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance is empowered by Section132 of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1938, as amended by Section 7of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, to appoint a sufficient numberof duly qualified medical practitioners to be &quot; appointed factory doctors &quot; forthe purposes of those Acts. The main duties of an appointed factory doctorunder the Acts are set out in Sections 73, 103 asd 132 of the Act of 1938,and an appointed factory doctor may also be called upon to perform certainduties under the Lead Paint (Protection against Poisoning) Act (NorthernIreland), 1927, and the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act (Northern Ireland),1927, which, though now repealed, is saved in this respect by Section 88 ofthe National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act (Northern Ireland), 1946.Section 133 of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1938, providesfor the payment to an appointed factory doctor(a) by the occupier of a factory, of fees prescribed by the Ministry forthe medical examination and certification of fitness of young persons for employment in that factory, and for any examination or medicalsupervision of persons employed in it carried out in pursuance of regulations or an order under the Act; and(b) as an expense of carrying the Act into effect, of fees determinedby the Ministry for the performance of any other duties underthe Act (such duties, for instance, as are specified in Section 73.)Dr. Robert S. Nixon was appointed by the Ministry on the 24th May,1952, to be an Appointed Factory Doctor for the Bangor District underSection 132(1) of the Factories Act (Northern Ireland), 1938, and a letternotifying him of his appointment was sent to him by the Ministry on that day.Following Dr. Nixon&apos;s election as a Member of Parliament an officerof the Ministry suggested to him on the telephone that the propriety of hisholding an appointment as an Appointed Factory Doctor now that he wasa Member of Parliament might be open to question. A copy of a statement by the officer concerned is attached. Dr. Nixon resigned his appointmentby a letter dated the 29th October, 1953, and acceptance of his resignationwas notified to him by the Ministry in a letter dated 30th October^ 1953.Copies of Dr. Nixon&apos;s application for appointment, of the Minuteappointing him, and of the Ministry&apos;s letter notifying him of his appointmentare attached, together with copies of his letter of resignation and the Ministry&apos;acceptance of it.

Note by Mr. Steele, Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Labourand National InsuranceAs regards Dr. Black&apos;s minute of 29th October, 1953, my recollection is that, onthe date mentioned, Dr. Black, Chief Inspector of Factories, brought it to my notice that Dr. Nixon had been elected a member of Parliament for North Down and was an appointed factory doctor. Dr. Black asked whether the Department was requiredto take any action.I replied to the effect that I thought it ought to be brought to Dr. Nixon&apos;s notice that he might be putting himself in a difficult position and said that if Dr. Blackwould wait, we would try to get Dr. Nixon on the &apos;phone.We got him on the &apos;phone and I told Dr. Nixon who I was and said that it hadbeen brought to my notice that he was an appointed factory doctor and, whilst theDepartment would not presume to give him advice, I thought it would only be right to tell him that he might find himself in serious difficulties if, now that he wasa Member of Parliament, he still continued to hold his appointment as an appointedfactory doctor. Dr. Nixon then asked what he should do, and I said that I couldnot be sure of the legal position and could not adyise him. I was merely telling him in a friendly way that it might be necessary for him to consider how he stood.Dr. Nixon asked if he should resign the factory doctor appointment and I said thatthat was really a matter for him. He ended up by saying that that seemed the bestthing to do and he would send in a letter of resignation that night.As this happened over two years ago I cannot at this stage be quite certain ofthe facts, but the foregoing statement is my recollection of what took place. AsDr. Black is in London at the moment I have not been able to ask him what hisrecollection of the matter is.(Signed) R. W. Steele.22nd February, 1956.
