The recommendations of the Military Advisers of SEATO may be.Summarised as follows:-(a)  Parts of the treaty area are indefensible unless powerfulSEATO forces are made immediately available after ^^^|the Communists commence overt aggression.(b)  The course of action which will most effectively and withthe least delay reducethe threatto the treaty area isthe attack by SEATO air forces upon selected targetsI^^- on the Chinese mainland and North Vietnam. Ifnuclear weapons are not used the forces required forsuccessful defence are unlikely to be available in thenumbers needed and within the time by which theymust be deployed. ^^^|(c)  The SEATO nations should adopt a concept of operations ^^^|employing atomic and non-atomic munitions. ^^^|I 3.     This recommendation has been endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff Committee ^^^|?ho, on 24th February, agreed that it was imperative that the future strategyIcr the defence of the treaty areas should be based on the assumption that?uclear weapons would be useds since without nuclear weapons there would ^^^|?pt be sufficient forces available for the successful defence of certain areas.? would therefore be necessary for SEATO to make use of some planningAssumption on the lines of that adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa-I&apos;amm Eon (NATO) in 1954.I 4.     If this decision is taken at this meeting it is bound to get out - indeed ^^^|the Pakistanis will no doubt see that it does if only to impress the Afghans. ^^^|?I 5.     Unless matters are handled with great care, any publicity is likely ^^^|to have serious repercussions throughout Asia and in India in particular..Very deep emotions may be aroused; Asia has not forgotten that the only ^^^|atom bombs dropped have been dropped on Asians.    There is a danger thatthe effect may be to drive India, China and Russia into each other&apos;s arms
I I    &apos; Iand to raise the question of white superiority.    (Atomic weapons would not -for the time being at least - be put into the hands of Asian troops but would beretained to be used by the &quot;white&quot; Powers.)^| 6.     It is clear that free Asia can only be defended by the employment ofnuclear weapons. This is not in question. Indeed, all our secret militaryplanning with Australia and New Zealand has been based on this assumption.7.     Moreover, as it is apparent to everyone that if the SEATO PowersIwere to restrict themselves to the use of conventional armaments, the areawould be indefensible, a decision of this character appears to be inevitableto sustain the morale among the Asian members of SEATO in the cold war.Furthermore, as a decision of a similar character has been taken in NATO,we cannot allow an impression to be created that we are less wholehearted^-W about our determination to defend   the SEATO area than the NATO .area. ^L^Lm0.     This means that criticisms from India and other neutralist Asiancountries must be faced.    But we should do everything possible to putmatters in perspective.    It would certainly be desirable that the SEATOCouncil, in taking the decision, should make it clear that the decision onlyrelates to a planning assumption.    It should therefore follow the formulaadopted in NATO which was to the effect that the Council unanimously&quot;approved the military report as a basis for defence planning, noting thatthis approval does not involve the delegation of the responsibility of Govern-ments for putting plans into action in the event of hostilities&quot;.mm mU^Lm Commonwealth Relations Office, S.
