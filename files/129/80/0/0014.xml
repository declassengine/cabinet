THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1956Copy No. 4 8CABINETWAR PENSIONS CLAIMSMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance on 30th November last my predecessor saw a deputation from the british legion and the Royal Air Forces Association. The purpose of this deputationwas to ask for a substantial increase in the rate of the basic disablement pension.My predecessor expressly undertook to consult his colleagues before replying.2. On 13th December my predecessor saw representatives, led bySir Robert Gary, M.P., of an All-Party House of Commons Committee whourged on him the claim of the British Limbless Ex-Service Men&apos;s Association(BLESMA) on behalf of the ageing limbless of the 1914-18 War. This deputationfollowed the unhappy events on 8th November when a number of badly disabledmen demonstrated near the Cenotaph. My predecessor undertook to let thedeputation have the Governments considered decision in due course.3. This Paper is concerned with these two separate and distinct claims andcontains my proposals on the line to be taken on each of them.4. It may help my colleagues in considering these claims to have a briefsummary of the broad bases of the existing War Pensions scheme. Since 1917the basic pension has been assessed by reference to disablement or loss of function,comparing the disabled person with a normal and healthy person of the same age and sex. The maximum assessment of 100 per cent, does, in fact, cover a fairlywide range of disability, including all disablement beyond a certain degree upto the extreme loss of function of the helpless or dying. Below this 100 per cent,level assessment is in steps of 10 per cent. The 100 per cent, rate of basicdisablement pension is now 67s. 6d. a week. Pensions for lower assessments are,of course, in proportion.5. The assessments are arrived at in two distinct ways in accordance withthe nature of the disablement. Certain injuries have fixed assessments prescribed in the Schedule to the Royal Warrant. For example, in the case of leg amputationsthe assessment is affected by the length of the stump. Other injuries and diseaseswhich are not contained in this Schedule have the assessment placed on themindividually by medical boards and Pensions Appeal Tribunals.6. Similar principles of compensation by reference to loss of function were adopted in 1946 for industrial injuries in place of the old workmen&apos;s compensationbasis of assessment by loss of earnings. The basic disablement pension for industrial injuries is now the same as for war pensions and this would make moredifficult a change in respect of war pensions only.7. The preferential position of war pensioners over the industrial injurypensioner has, however, in some degree been preserved in the allowances for theunemployable pensioner, for dependants and for widows, orphans, &amp;e. It hasbeen the policy in recent years to seek to deal with the really hard cases, that isto say of the man unable to work and requiring to be looked after, by increasingthese allowances. This policy has not prevented increases in the basic pensions which were raised to their present level as recently as February, 1955. But ithas the advantage of making rather more provision for the cases of real hardshipSECRETCP. (56) 645th March, 195649667b
while not increasing unduly the amounts paid to some hundreds of thousands ofwar pensioners whose disabilities do not prevent them from earning a living atthe present high level of wages.8. The basic rate for 100 per cent, disablement for a private soldier (thereare higher rates for non-commissioned and for commissioned officers) was fixed at 40s. in 1919 and in respect, of 1914-18 war pensioners it remained at that leveluntil 1946. For pensioners whose injuries arose between the wars the rate in 1938was 32s. 6d., which rate was applied to 1939-45 war pensioners until it, too, was raised to 40s. in 1943. In February, 1946, the rate for all war pensioners was raised to 45s.; in 1952 to 55s.; and last year to 67s. 6d.Claim by the British Legion9. The British Legion, who for some time have been pressing for a basic rate of 90s. a week for the 100 per cent, cases, make great play with the argument that to retain the value of a 40s. pension in 1938 it would be necessary to raisethe basic rate of pension to 97s. 9d. to-day. This argument has frequently been used in the House by Sir Ian Fraser, the National President of the Legion, andothers. So far as it goes it is a valid argument. But it is subject to the criticismfirst of all that the rate for injuries resulting from peace-time service was in 1938not 40s. but 32s. 6d.; and that taking even the 40s. figure one can get quite differentresults by selecting years other than 1938. But the real, as opposed to thedialectical answer, is that it has been the policy of successive Governments tomake big improvements in the special allowances payable in the worst cases andso in some degree to shift the emphasis to providing for those who are really in need of help. Account can also be taken of the great increase in social services generally since 1938. Of course, from the point of view of the British Legionthese improvements being applicable to the population as a whole, tend to diminish the lead of the war disabled over other classes; but in dealing with real need theyare clearly relevant.10. The British Legion (Scotland) in particular has made the point that whatever comparisons are possible with former rates of pension they do not take into account the real increase in standards of living of those in employment. Thefigures given by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in the House on23rd February, showing the substantial increase in the purchasing power of average earnings during the last few years, are material to this contention. Butthey have perhaps greater relevance to the case of men who cannot work by reasonof their disability than to the large number receiving the basic rates of pension who in general can share in the increase of real earnings.11. Comparison is also made by the British Legion and their supporters withthe rates of pension payable in Commonwealth countries and the United States.Such comparisons are difficult to make accurately since it is necessary to makeallowance both for the cost of living in such countries and for the presence orabsence of other social services. When the fullest allowance is made for that itis apparent that, apart from the United States and Canada, both Australia and NewZealand appear to make rather more generous overall provision for their wardisabled than is made in this country. I attach as Appendix I a short summaryof the provision made in those countries.12. Since the increase in basic pension rates last February the Index of retail prices has risen from 146 to 153 in January 1956 and wage levels have shownsubstantial increases. I understand that each shilling on the basic rate of pension(together with consequential increases for widows) costs the Exchequer about amillion pounds a year. The provision for war pensions as a whole, i.e., includingallowances, made in this year&apos;s Estimates is  90 millions.13. In view of the fact that the increase in the basic rate of pension made ayear ago was.the largest ever made, of the inevitable repercussions on other formsof social service payments, and of the general position of the economy, Ihave comesomewhat reluctantly to the conclusion that it would not be right in presentcircumstances to ask my colleagues to agree to a further increase in the basic rateof pension. I propose, therefore, to write to Sir Ian Fraser on the Legion&apos;s presentclaim telling him that for the time being at any rate it does not seem possible tous to make an increase in the basic rate of war pension.  My colleagues, however,
should be aware that a decision in this sense will be very badly received both bythe British Legion, which is at the moment vigorously campaigning for an increase,and by a very large section of our own supporters in the House of Commons.Claim by the British Limbless Ex-Service Men&apos;s Association14. The claim, which has not been precisely or consistently presented, appearsto be for an additional allowance from age 55 varying from As: to 10s. a weekaccording to the assessment of disablement (40 per cent, to 100 per cent.). Briefly,the grounds of the claim are that the wearing of an artificial limb constitutes agreater disability in advancing age, with increased fatigue, discomfort and loss ofamenities, and that the gap in functional capacity between the limbless and thenon-limbless widens with advancing years. The claim in substance is made onbehalf of the limbless men of the 1914-18 War.15. There are some 22,000 of these out of the total of 34,000 limbless war pensioners. Of the 1914-18 men 15,200 have lost one leg, 6,100 one arm and740 more than one limb. Some 2,100 are receiving one or more of the supple-mentary allowances for unemployability (45s. a week), constant attendance(generally from 15s.-30.y. a week), comforts (10s. a week), and lowered standardof occupation (up to 27s. 6d. a week). Nearly 20,000 of them are receivingallowances for wear and tear of clothing, amounting to  6 or  10 a year. Nearly7,000 of them, or about one-third, are now over 65 years of age.16. The claim, which dates back some time, is now being very strongly pressedin view of the increasing average age (now 64) of pensioners of the First world war. It has been turned down by my predecessors for broadly the following reasons:  (i) Since 1917 the assessment of war disablement has been based on the comparison between the disabled pensioner and a normal healthyperson of the same age.(ii) In 1946 an inter-departmental Committee under the chairmanship ofJudge Hancock reported that it was not possible to establish that the functional effect of amputations was affected so directly by the person&apos;sage as to render it practicable or desirable to fix different assessmentsfor different age groups,(hi) A further Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Ernest Rock Carlingin 1954 found that limb amputations and the wearing of an artificiallimb did not aggravate cardio-vascular disorders to any significantextent, and that there was no material difference between the mortalityrates of amputees and of pensioners whose wounds did not involveamputation.(iv) It would be wrong to treat amputees more favourably than other classesof severely disabled war pensioners, e.g., paraplegics.(v) It is arguable that amputation is a greater deprivation in youth than in age.(vi) The limbless pensioners have shared in the general improvements bothin war pensions and in other social provisions in recent years.(vii) Increased disability resulting from positive accentuation of the disabilityitself, e.g., where deterioration of the stump prevents the wearing ofan artificial limb or obesity results from immobility imposed by lossof limbs, can be met by reassessment.17. In the light of the medical opinions expressed by the Hancock and RockCarling Committees, I would have been prepared to suggest to my colleagues a reply to the BLESMA claim turning it down on the grounds that there was nomedical support for the view that the gap between the disabled and the normalman widened with age either in the case of amputations or other disabilities. Inoted, however, that BLESMA claimed the support of a number of leading figures in the medical world, including Sir Russell Brain, President of the Royal college of Physicians, Sir Harry Platt, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and professor McFarland, the well-known Orthopaedic Specialist. I therefore thoughtit prudent to discuss the matter informally with the Presidents of the two RoyalColleges. Sir Russell Brain, after a preliminary discussion, asked if he might soundsome of his leading professional colleagues and, having done so, I had a furthertalk with him last week.49667
18. The substance of Sir RusseLTs view is set out in a letter which I havereceived from him and the relevant passages of which I attach as Appendix II.The substance of his view is that the research work on lung ventilation undertaken on behalf of the Medical Research Council suggests, as he said to me, that, while there was not &quot; a proven case for an ageing allowance to the limbless and otherdisabled men, he did think, however, that in the light of medical advances sincethe Hancock Report was made there was a case to answer.&quot; Specifically therewas the question whether the diminishing lung capacity which all suffered withage (between 40 and 60) imposed on the limbless a relatively greater disablement(the symptom of which was breathlessness) by reason of the extra exertion whichthe ordinary movements of life required of them.19. This view from the President of the Royal College of Physicians make sit in my view impossible to turn down the BLESMA claim on the grounds thatmedical opinion is against them. On the other hand, I do not think it is yetsufficiently clear that the consensus of medical opinion has so changed as to justifyeither a general or a limited application to war pensions of the principle thatdisability increases with age. In particular there is the difficult problem as t ithe type of disability where this factor occurs. And the complexity of the matter is accentuated by the fact that whereas in the case of some diseases of a progressivenature attributable to war service reassessments cannot always exclude any element of worsening that may be due to age in cases such as amputations, where the degree of assessment is specified in the Royal Warrant this is not possible andthe assessment can only be increased where there is some specific deteriorationconnected with the injury itself.20. Sir Russell Brain, with whom I had a long and helpful discussion,suggested that the appropriate step to take at present was to seek the advice of theMedical Research Council. He pointed out that the new medical opinions referredto above derive from the Medical Research Councils work and that they were already working in related fields. What he had in mind was the possibility thatthe Medical Research Council might after further experiment find that thediminished lung capacity which, as referred to above, has been found to developwith age might, when coupled with the extra degree of exertion involved in overcoming the handicap of wearing an artificial leg, amount to a measurableincreased disability relative to a normal man of the same age. My department has, therefore, approached the Medical Research Council and I very much hopethat with the Lord Presidents approval they will find it possible to embark onthis investigation now and carry it to a conclusion as rapidly as may be.21. I propose, therefore, replying to BLESMA&apos;s claim through Sir RobertCary, in the above sense, as soon as I have ascertained that the Medical research council will undertake this investigation. It will not, of course, satisfyBLESMA who are carrying on a very vigorous campaign in which they have secured the support of a very large number of local authorities and of Membersof Parliament. However, for the reasons given above, I do not think it would be right to make any of the changes which they request in the War Pensions systemuntil we are satisfied both that there is a sound medical case for some provisionfor age and a feasible means of measuring that provision. On the other hand, inthe light of the medical opinions which I have received I think that in Sir RussellBrain&apos;s phrase &quot; there is a case to answer.&quot;J. A.

APPENDIX IIExtract from a Letter of 13th February from Sir Russell Brain, Presidentof the Royal College of PhysiciansI promised to let you have in further detail the grounds for my view that thedisability resulting from amputation is adversely affected by increasing age. Someof those to whom I have spoken on this matter have said that this is certainly theirimpression based upon their experience. Such an impression from experiencedobservers deserves careful consideration, even if the grounds for it are not preciselyformulated. Nevertheless, I believe that a good deal of evidence can be brought forward in support of this view.A good deal is now known about the effect of age on the ventilation of thelungs. It has been shown, for example, that the maximum voluntary ventilationof the lungs in normal individuals decreases by about 25 per cent, betweenthe ages of forty and sixty. Those who maintain that the difference between theamputee and the ordinary man is unaffected by age would presumably argue that since age affects the ventilation of the lungs, presumably equally in the two groups,it leaves their relative position unchanged, but I believe this argument to befallacious. A man whose maximum voluntary ventilation has diminished willbecome breathless as a result of less exertion than before. The increased exertiondemanded of an amputee is likely, therefore, to cause him to become breathlesswhen age has diminished his lung ventilation capacity, when a normal person, ofthe same age, does not become breathless, because less is demanded of him. thus the normal effect of ageing upon lung ventilation is likely to add to the embarrassment and discomforts of the amputee, relative to the normal man.Other examples of the effect of age upon the disability produced by pulmonarylesions are provided by a recent M.R.C. report (J. C. Gilson and P. Hugh-Jones,Special Report 290, 1955, fig. 26). The authors show that the diminution inmaximum pulmonary voluntary ventilation, which occurs with age, increases the severity of the disability produced by pneumoconiosis. Here, however, the positionis complicated by the fact that age also increases the disability directly due to the disease, so that as time goes on the patient suffers from the combined result of a progressive lung disease and the normal effect of ageing.In conclusion I would say therefore that there is now considerable evidencethat the Hancock Committee was wrong when it said that &quot; it is not possible toestablish that the functional effects of any of the specified injuries depends sodirectly on the injured person&apos;s age as to render it practicable or desirable to fixdifferent assessments for different age groups.&quot; There is evidence which supportsthe clinical impression of experienced observers that the differential between theamputee and the normal person does not remain stationary with age, but that theamputee&apos;s disability in the broadest sense increases with age. I do not feelcompetent to say how this differential should be assessed or defined, nor, forexample, whether it applies equally to the upper and to the lower limbs. Thewhole question is clearly a complex one and many other factors than those whichI have mentioned in this letter have to be taken into account. In conclusion Iwould point out that the sort of disability which I am here discussing has, as faras I can judge, no relationship to the amputee&apos;s expectation of life, and the view which I am here putting forward does not conflict with the conclusion of the RockCarling Committee that amputees are not subject to an increased mortality rate.
