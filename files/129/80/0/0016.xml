(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALa-1;CP,(56) 66 COPY NO. j j3rd March, 1956CABINETCOST OF LIVINGMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service the Cost of Living Advisory Committee have presented a Report,a copy of which I attach, recommending the termination of the presentInterim Index of Retail Prices and the immediate introduction of a newIndex of Retail Prices based on the results of the large-scale householdexpenditure enquiry held in 1953/54.     The Cost of Living AdvisoryCommittee is a Standing Departmental Committee, under Ministry ofLabour Chairmanship, and comprises representatives of the principalGovernment Departments, together with representatives of -The British Employers&apos; ConfederationThe Trades Union congress the Co-operative movement the Retail Distributive TradesThe National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutesand a number of independent persons.     The Committee was appointed on 8th August, 1946, to advise the Minister of Labour on the basis of theofficial cost-of-living index figure and on matters connected therewith.2.      The present Interim Index of Retail Prices was introduced inJune, 194-7, on the recommendations of this Committee, and was based onthe expenditure patterns of working-class households in 1937/38 shown by the household expenditure enquiry held in those years.In 1950, following growing criticisms of the out-of-date weightingbasis of the Index, the Cost of Living Advisory Committee was asked toconsider whether conditions of spending could be regarded as sufficientlystable to justify the holding of a new, full-scale enquiry into householdexpenditure to serve as the basis of a new Index of retail prices.    InJune, 1951, the Committee reported and recommended a full-scale enquiry into household expenditure.    Since it would be some time before the resultsof this enquiry could be available, certain temporary revisions to theIndex were made as from January, 1952, and a full-scale enquiry wascarried out over a period of twelve months in 1953/54, in accordance withdetailed proposals made by the Advisory Committee.    All types of house-holds in the United Kingdom were covered and 12, 911 provided usablebudgets.     The Advisory Committee examined the great mass of informationyielded by this enquiry and their present Report contains detailed proposalsfor a new Index which could be introduced at once.
3.      The Committee&apos;s main recommendations are:-(i)    The existing Interim Index of Retail Prices should be terminated, and a new Index, to be called the &quot;index of Retail prices&apos; should be instituted as from january, 1956, to show future monthly changes inthe level of retail prices compared with January, 1956,taken as equal to 100.(ii)    The weights for the new Index should be based on the pattern of expenditure revealed by the 1953/54 house-hold expenditure enquiry.(iii)    The new Index would be designed to measure average price changes for households which would includepractically all wage-earners and small and mediumsalary-earners.    For this purpose the budgetssupplied by all classes of households should be usedwith the exception of -(a) those from households of the head of whichhad a recorded gross income in 1953 of 20 a week or more;   and(b) those from households in which at least three-quarters of the total income wasderived from National Insurance retire-ment or similar pensions and/or national assistance paid in supplementation orinstead of such pensions.The Committee recommended the exclusion of thesetwo groups of households on the grounds that the pattern of their spending was appreciably different from that of the average household.     The 11, 630 house-holds whose budges would be used to provide weightswould reflect the expenditure patterns of nearly nine-tenths of all households in the United Kingdom.(iv)    The Committee recommended that the official index figure should in future be quoted with prices at January, 1956taken as 100.    We should however link the all-itemsfigure of the new Index to the corresponding figure for January, 1956 in the existing Index, in order tocontinue to show the change in the average level of retail prices since   June, 1947.4,      If January, 1956 is taken as the base of the new Index, the lastfigure in the existing Interim Index will be that for 17th January which was published on 20th February.     The first figure in the new Index will be thatfor 14th February, to be published about 20th March.    An immediate decision is therefore essential if effect is to be given to this recommenda-tion.5.      If my colleagues agree, I propose -(a)    To accept the recommendations of the Cost of LivingAdvisory Committee for the introduction forthwithof a new Index of Retail Prices and to publish theCommittee&apos;s Report immediately.
(b)    To make a Statement - as in Annex A - after questions in the House on 13th March.Special Index for Fensioners6.      The exclusion from the weighting basis of the new Index of a group of households representing old people largely dependent on national insurance retirement pensions or National Assistance will inevitably giverise to a renewal of the demands for the compilation of a special index ofprices for &quot;pensioners&quot;.    Over the last few years there has beencriticism of the existing retail prices Index as a measure of changes inthe cost of living of &quot;pensioners&quot; on the grounds that it understates theproportion of their expenditure which goes on food and fuel.    Thesecriticisms are bound to be reinforced when it is seen that both food and fuel and light have smaller weights in the new Index than in the presentInterim Index.     Moreover the publication, later in the year, of the detailedresults of the expenditure enquiry will for the first time provide information about the distinct expenditure pattern of this &quot;pensioner&quot; group.7.      The Minister of Pensions feels that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to resist demands for a special-Index based on the expenditurepattern of this group.    He thinks, therefore, tha.t there is much to be said for agreeing to provide such an Index,  especially as a reasonably accurateone could be calculated for this group when the detailed results of theexpenditure enquiry are published.      Together with the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury we have discussed this matter.     The Financial secretary and I are firmly of the opinion that the Government ought not to undertaketo publish a special Index of retail prices for &quot;pensioners&quot;.    Such an Indexwould be liable to cause confusion.    Interested parties will tend to quotewhichever Index happens to show the greater upv/ard movement, with the inevitable result of undermining confidence in the general Index of retail prices.    I regard it as of the greatest importance in industrial relationsthat the new Index of retail prices recommended by the Cost of LivingAdvisory Committee should be accepted on all sides as the mostaccurate measure of changes in the average level of retail prices and that nothing should be done to endanger such acceptance,0.      I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that an additional Index of retail prices covering a special group of households should not bepublished.I.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S. W. 1.2nd March, 1956.
ANNEX ADRAFT statement the Cost of Living Advisory Cotximittee have recommended thetermination of the present Interim Index of Retail Prices and the immediate introduction of a new Index of Retail Prices based on the results of thelarge-scale household expenditure enquiry which was carried out over aperiod of 12 months in 1953/54.    A full report of this enquiry will bepublished later.The Committee&apos;s main recommendations are -First -The existing Interim Index of Retail Prices should be terminated, and a new Index, to be called the Index of retail Prices, should be instituted as from January, 1956,to show future monthly changes in the level of retail pricescompared with January, 1956 taken as equal to 100.Secondly -The weights for the new Index should be based on the pattern of expenditure revealed by the 1953/54 householdexpenditure enquiry.Thirdly -The new Index would be designed to measure average price changes for households which would include practically all wage-earners and small and medium salary-earners.For this purpose the budgets supplied by all classes of house-holds should be used with the exception of -Those from households, the head of which had arecorded gross income in 1953 or  20 a week or more;   andThose from households in which at least three-quarters of the total income was derived from national Insurance retirement or similar pensionsand/or National Assistance paid in supplementa-tion or instead of such pensions.The 11, 638 households whose budgets will be used to provide weightswill reflect the expenditure patterns of nearly nine-tenths of all householdsin.the United Kingdom.The Government accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations and thenew Index will be introduced immediately.     The first Index figure on thenew basis will show the level of prices at 14th February compared with thelevel at 17th January, 1956, and will be published later this month.    Inorder to show the movement of prices since 1947 we propose also to publish a figure^takii^^htg^^-tirrre figure of the new Index to the existing InterimIndex of Retail Prices.

The index was intended to serve as a temporary expedient until a new full-scale enquiry into household expenditure could be undertaken toprovide an up-to-date weighting basis for a new index.In their Report dated 26th June, 1951 (Cmd. 8328) the Advisory Com-mittee recommended that an enquiry into household expenditure should beheld as soon as possible, and that in the meantime certain modificationsshould be made in the (Interim Index. These recommendations were accepted.Various changes were made in the method of calculating the index asfrom the beginning of 1952, including modifications to the weighting basis.Following this, plans for a new largesscale household expenditure enquirywere drawn up by the Advisory Committee with the help of their technical committee and the enquiry was carried out over a period of twelve monthsstarting at the end of January, 1953.A full report on this expenditure enquiry will be published in due course,but sufficient information has already become available from the enquiry toenable the Advisory Committee to report on how it should be used in thepreparation of a new index of retail prices. In this Report the Committeestate that, with the help of the Technical Committee, they have examined theinformation collected and are satisfied that it will provide a reliable and representative basis for calculating the weighting pattern for a new index.They recommend that for this purpose the budgets supplied by all classes of households should be used other than:  &apos;(a) those from households the head of which had a recorded grossincome in 1953 of  20 a week or more, and(b) those from households in which at least three-quarters of the total income was derived from National Insurance retirement or similarpensions and /or National Assistance paid in supplementation orinstead of such pensions.Excluding these two groups, the number of households which provided usablebudgets was 11,638 and the Report states that these households would reflect the expenditure pattern of nearly nine-tenths of all households in the UnitedKingdom.The Report contains recommendations regarding the structure of the newindex and the items to be priced ; these items include a number of com-modities and services additional to those priced for the Interim Index.In general the Advisory Committee regard the existing methods of collectingand summarising the prices information as satisfactory but certain modifica-tions are suggested, principally in regard to the &quot; Housing&quot; group of theindex.
IBtime, there should he a supplementary calculation to show the change in theaverage level of retail prices since June, 1947, this figure being the result oflinking the all-items index figure in the new series with the all-items indexfigure for January, 1956, in the existing Interim Index.The Report sets out the complete series of weights to be used in the newindex and, for the main groups into which the index will be divided, a comparison is given of the new weights with those hitherto used i&apos;n the interim Index.
COST OF LIVING ADVISORY committee report ON PROPOSALS FOR A NEW INDEX OF RETAIL prices to the Rt. Hon. the Minister of Labour and National ServiceSir,I-introduction. In our Interim Report, dated 26th June, 1951, published in August, 1951(Cmd. 8328), we recommended that a full-scale enquiry into household ex-penditure should be held as soon as possible in order to provide up-to-date information regarding the pattern of expenditure to serve as the basis fora new index of retail prices. We stated that such an enquiry would involvehighly complex operations necessitating careful and detailed planning inadvance and that the investigations themselves would have to be spreadover a full year in order to take full account of seasonal fluctuations in expenditure. After this stage a lengthy period would be needed for the scrutiny of the large mass of information received and for tabulating andanalysing the results. We therefore recommended certain temporary modifi-cations in the existing retail prices index until such time as the results ofthe household expenditure enquiry became available. These temporarymodifications were set out in our &quot; Report on the Working of the InterimIndex of Retail Prices&quot;, dated 17th January, 1952, and published in March,1952 (Cmd. 8481), and they were incorporated in the index as from February,1952.2. In the meantime our recommendation that a new household expendi-ture enquiry should be undertaken was accepted and the planning of theenquiry was started. The Ministry of Labour and National Service werecharged with the responsibility of conducting the enquiry and with the help of our Technical Committee they drew up the detailed plans and draftedthe schedules, all of which were submitted to us for approval. By scientificmethods of sampling a selection of nearly 20,000 addresses was drawn from local rating records, representative of all types of households in the UnitedKingdom. The work of visiting these households began towards the endof January, 1953, and continued over the following twelve months, differenthouseholds being visited at different periods. The visiting in Great britain was undertaken by local officers of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService and by the staff of the Social Survey unit of the Central Office ofInformation ; in Northern Ireland the work was undertaken by staff of theNorthern Ireland Ministry of Labour and National Insurance. In all, nearly13,000 households co-operated fully in the enquiry by supplying detailedrecords of their expenditure over three consecutive weeks together with other information needed for the enquiry. The work of scrutinising and summaris-ing the great mass of information supplied proceeded as rapidly as possiblethroughout 1954 and the earlier months of 1955. By that time, althoughtabulations were very far from being complete, sufficient information was available to enable us, with the help of the Technical Committee, to startconsidering how it should be used in the preparation of a new index of retail prices,
3. The expenditure enquiry was designed to provide information for other purposes in addition to weights for a new index, and it was based on a sample of households of all kinds. This report is not a report on the enquiry as such. We have regarded as our most urgent task the examination of theresults of the enquiry for the purpose of using such information as was appropriate for a new prices index. It is the intention of the Ministry to publish a full report on the enquiry in due course,II Selection of Budgets to be used forWeights for a new Index of Retail Prices4. In our report dated June, 1951, we suggested that the new index shouldbe based on a collection of budgets from households within income rangeswhich would include practically all wage eafners and most small and mediumsalary earners. At that time we believed that this object could be achievedwith a sample of budgets from households in which the earnings of thehead of the household fell approximately within the limits of  150 to  1,000a year. The omission of households with high incomes and also those with small incomes, such as old age pensioners and unemployed with no other resources, was suggested because the pattern of expenditure of such house-holds must differ substantially from the general average of the householdswhich we should wish to include. We proposed, however, that a finaldecision on the precise limits to be adopted should not be made until wehad had an opportunity of studying the figures resulting from the budgetenquiry. We also expressed the view that, within&apos; such income limits as were ultimately fixed, the new index should be based on information collected from all classes of households including, for example, farmers, shopkeepersand self-employed persons as well as employees.5. In the light of the figures now available from the 1953-54 enquiry, andwith the help of the Technical Committee, we have reconsidered this questionof the classes of households whose budgets&apos; should be used for weighting thenew index and we have arrived at the following conclusions.The Upper Limit6. We believe that, whatever may be the position in the lower incomeranges, the pattern of household spending in the higher income ranges islikely to be determined more by the income of the head of the household thanby its total income. There would, of course, be some households where thiswas not so ; but on balance we are satisfied that at the upper end of thescale a line drawn by reference to the total income of all members of the household would result in excluding a number of households whose pattern of spending was broadly similar to that of many other households included.If the object is to exclude households whose expenditure pattern differs sub-stantially from that of the bulk of households, we believe that at the upperincome level this object is more likely to be achieved by excluding householdsby reference to the income of the head rather than to the total income of the household.7. The whole sample of 12,911 households which provided usable budgetsin the enquiry has been analysed by reference to the level of income of the&apos; head of the household.   It was found that there were 58 households where
the head&apos;s gross income in 1953 was  50 a week or more, 111 where it was 30 but under  50, and 291 where it was  20 but under  30. There were thus 460 households out of the total of 12,911 (or about Z\ per cent.) inwhich the income of the head of the household ranged from  20 a weekupwards. There is reason to believe that the response from the higher incomehouseholds was somewhat less than that from the lower income groups, the deficiency becoming apparent above the  20 a week level. If they were included, these higher income households would therefore be somewhat under-represented in an aggregation of all the budgets in the sample. The mostimportant argument, however, for excluding households in the higher incomeranges is that their expenditure pattern is different and also shows greatervariability between one household and another, so that figures of averageexpenditure are liable to be affected by abnormal expenditure recorded byone or more high income households.8. There can be no certainty that one particular income level provides thebest possible line of demarcation, but the expenditure figures of households, taken as a group, display a pattern of spending which differsconsiderably from that of the bulk of the households in the sample. With theexception of expenditure on meals outside the home, these households showa substantially lower proportion of expenditure on food than that of otherhouseholds taken as a whole. This is also true of expenditure on fuel and light (with the exception of coke and electricity) and on tobacco. In contrast,these 460 households record proportions of expenditure on various &quot; services &quot;(e.g., domestic help, education, entertainments, holidays, etc.) which are considerably higher than those for the bulk of households in the sample.9. These considerations have led us to the yiew that an upper line of demarcation drawn so as to exclude these 460 households would be the mostsuitable for the purpose in view. We therefore recommend that the house-holds whose budgets are to be used for index weighting purposes shouldexclude those in which the gross income of the head of the household was 20 a week or over in 1953.The Lower Limit10. We found that in the total sample of 12,911 households there were 1,843(or about 14 per cent.) in which the income of the head of the household fellbelow  3 a week, which was the lower limit we had tentatively suggested inour earlier report. The large majority of these households could not, how-ever, have been entirely dependent upon the income of the head, since therewere only 747 households in which the total income of the householdwas less than  3 a week. In many cases the income of the person classified as the head of the household formed only a small part of the total income ofthe household. In view of this we reached the conclusion that at the lowerend of the scale it seemed unlikely that the pattern of household spendingwould be determined mainly by the income of the head of the household.11. We then considered a proposal that the lower line of demarcationshould be related to the aggregate income of the household. There were747 households in the sample in which the total household income was under 3 a week. These were largely one-person households, but there were somehundreds of other one-person households with incomes above the  3 aweek limit, many only a little above that limit. It seemed to us therefore that any separation by reference to a household income at the bottom endof the scale, such as  3 a week, would include some households and excludeothers whose circumstances are very similar and would not achieve theobject we had in view.331827 A 3
12. We therefore suggest that income should not be the sole criterion forexcluding households at the lower end of the scale but that any line of demarcation should be set so as to exclude those whose chief source of income was a National Insurance retirement or similar pension. For thispurpose a separate tabulation was made for the following groups of households:  (a) all households in which at least three-quarters of the total householdincome was derived from National Insurance Retirement Pensions,Non-Contributory Old Age Pensions, or any form of Widow&apos;s orDisability Pensions (if the recipient was over 60 years of age)(6) all households in which at least three-quarters of the total householdincome was derived from payments of the above types plus national assistance(c) the few households consisting of a retired person or retired coupleliving on their own and not receiving any of the pensions referredto in (a) and (b), their income being wholly or mainly derived from national Assistance.13. There were 813 households falling within these categories. Theycontained 1,216 persons, only 10 of whom were recorded as working for gainor profit; nearly 60 per cent, of these households contained only one personliving alone. They form a group which is fairly homogeneous and having a pattern of expenditure which is appreciably different from that of theaverage household in the sample. We therefore suggest that the budgets ofthese households should be excluded from those to be used for providingindex weights.14. If this proposal and the proposal to exclude the 460 households inwhich the income of the head was  20 a week or more were accepted, about10 per cent, of the whole sample of budgets would be excluded, and the weights for the new index would be based on the information supplied bythe remaining 90 per cent. We consider that the budgets supplied by thisintermediate group of 11,638 households will provide a satisfactory founda-tion upon which to construct a weighting basis for a new retail prices index.These households would reflect the expenditure pattern of nearly nine-tenthsof all households in the United Kingdom. We understand that when theMinistry publishes a report of the enquiry, details will be shown separatelyfor each of the two excluded groups.Ill Representativeness of the Sample of households and Accuracy of Informationsupplied15. Before any of the summarised details from the budgets could be usedto provide weights for the new index it was necessary to examine the figurescarefully in order to judge whether the enquiry had provided reliable and representative information. At the outset it was necessary to consider whetherthe households which had kept records constituted a representative sampleof households in general, with special reference to the kinds of householdswhose budgets we proposed to use as a weighting basis for the revised index.After comparing the distribution and characteristics of the households inthe sample with other available statistics regarding households in the UnitedKingdom in general, we came to the conclusion that, as a result of the
careful way in which the selection of addresses was made and of the goodresponse from the households visited, the sample of households from whichbudgets were collected can be regarded in general as a satisfactory one.The only indication we found that the sample of 12,911 households whichsupplied budgets might not be altogether representative of all householdsin the country was some under-representation of (1) households with highincomes and (2) old persons and one-person households. Most of thesehouseholds which were under-represented would not, however, fall withinthe broad group whose budgets we should wish to use for the purpose of theindex. For this broad group we found no serious reason to doubt therepresentativeness of the sample of households from which budgets had beenreceived.16. It was also necessary to be sure that the information on spendingrecorded in the budgets was reliable. More information is now available about national expenditure and income than at the time of the previoushousehold expenditure enquiry in 1937-38, and, with the help of the technical committee, we have considered the details summarised from the budgets inthe light of this information. Our conclusion is that there is evidence of only one major deficiency in the budgets. This concerns the amountsrecorded as spent on alcoholic drink and tobacco. Although special effortswere made in this enquiry to overcome the expected reluctance of some people to record the full extent of their expenditure on alcoholic drink and tobacco, comparison of the results with estimates based on customs and excise figures shows quite clearly that there has been a substantial under-recording of this type of expenditure in the budgets and these particularfigures are therefore unacceptable. As will be seen later, we have beenable to estimate the appropriate weights which should be assigned to these items.17. We found that the average amounts recorded as having been spent on food by the households which supplied budgets generally agreed closely with information available from other sources and the only deficiencies appearto be in some under-recording of expenditure on meals consumed outsidethe home and on sweets and chocolates, ice cream and soft drinks. Forother commodities and for various types of services we compared thesummarised details recorded in the budgets with such other statistics as areavailable regarding expenditure on these items and we found that, allowing for certain differences in the classification of individual items, there was closeagreement between the two sets of figures and that such differences as wererevealed were of a minor character.18. The co-operating households were asked to supply some information about their incomes in addition to giving full records of their expenditure but the principal object in asking, questions about incomes was to obtain information that would be sufficient for the purpose of classifying householdsinto a number of broad groups at different income levels. It would havebeen sufficient for this purpose had the members of the household indicated the approximate size or range of their incomes but in fact the incomerecipients in 96 per cent, of all households which were prepared to keeprecords of expenditure were also prepared to state details of their grossincomes as at the time of the enquiry. The remaining 4 per cent, whichkept records were unwilling to give details of their incomes or providedincome details for certain members only, and although it proved possible to allocate the great majority of these households to one or other of the broadincome groups referred to above, it was not possible to estimate their incomes
with sufficient precision to permit of including them in any calculationspurporting to show average incomes. Although most of the co-operatinghouseholds did, in fact, give information about their incomes, it seems clearthat in very many cases they must have considerably understated theirincomes. Understatement of incomes is a general experience in enquiriesof this kind and in this enquiry there was probably a tendency to recordnet incomes after deduction of income tax, National Insurance contributions,contributions to pension funds and various other deductions from wages orsalaries, instead of gross incomes for which the schedules asked. It is alsoprobable that there were frequent omissions or understatements in manycases unintentional of overtime pay, bonuses, earnings from subsidiaryemployments or from property and various kinds of non-recurring income.19. The collection of precise details of incomes was not one of the mainobjects of the enquiry and, in spite of the understatements, the information supplied was sufficient to enable the households to be adequately grouped inorder of magnitude of their incomes. In so far as income level is used as aline of demarcation for selecting the budgets to be used for weighting theindex, the object is to exclude households whose general pattern of expenditure is markedly different from that of the majority of households, and this objectwill be achieved even if a certain number of households somewhat under-stated their incomes and in consequence were classified on the basis of their declared incomes rather than their true incomes. The principal object of theenquiry was to obtain accurate records of expenditure and the apparent under-statement of incomes does not, in our view, cast any doubt upon the generalreliability of the detailed information about expenditure.20. Summing up paragraphs 15 to 19, we conclude that the 1953-54 enquiryhas been successful in providing a reliable and representative collection ofbudgets for the purpose of weighting a new retail prices index. With adjust-ments for a few items, of which alcoholic drink, tobacco and meals boughtand consumed outside the home are the most important, the budgets willprovide a basis for a new index which should command public confidence.21. If the proposals made in paragraphs 9 and 13 are accepted, theweighting pattern of the new index will be based on the budgets from a sample of households representative of nearly nine-tenth of all householdsin the United Kingdom. The number of households in this sample was11,638 and they comprised 38,205 persons. Seven per cent, of the householdsconsisted of one person living alone, about 54 per cent, consisted of eithertwo or three persons, and the balance were households in which the numberof persons ranged from four up to fifteen. On the average, each 100 house-holds in the sample was made up of 328 persons, of whom 149 were reported as working for gain, and 12 as retired from work, while 178 were recorded as in receipt of some form of income (whether or not from working) amountingto 10s. a week or more. The number of children under 16 in this sampleof 11,638 households was 10,905, or about 94 to every 100 households.
IV Types of Expenditure to be Includedin Weighting22. From time to time suggestions have been made that the retail prices index should take account of price changes only for those goods or servicesthat could be regarded as basic necessaries. For example, it might be suggested that alcoholic drink, tobacco, entertainments, etc., should be ex-cluded. In the past the index has never purported to measure price changesfor necessaries only and, apart from the difficulty of defining &quot; necessaries &quot;.there would be many serious objections to a limitation of the index in thisway. We are firmly of the opinion that, as in the past, the general design of the index should be such as to enable price changes to be measured for thewhole field of goods and services over which households distribute their expenditure.23. We propose, however, that certain kinds of payments recorded in thebudgets should be excluded from the calculations. These are:  Income tax.National Insurance contributions.Life insurance premiums and payments to pension funds.Premiums for household insurance (other than insurance of the building).Subscriptions to trade unions, friendly societies, hospital funds, etc. ;church collections ; other cash gifts.&quot; Pools &quot; and other betting payments.Doctors&apos;, dentists&apos;, etc., fees.Capital sums or instalments, mortgage payments, etc., for house purchase and expenditure on major structural enlargements and additions.Most expenditure of these types is excluded from the weighting pattern ofthe present index, largely because of the variable and non-measurable natureof the services acquired in return for the payments made and because of thedifficulty or impossibility of identifying a &quot; unit&quot; the price of which couldbe measured from date to date. Life insurance premiums, payments intopension funds, etc., are regarded as largely in the nature of savings or deferredexpenditure. Similarly premiums for fire, burglary, etc., insurance representa transfer of purchasing power since the major part of such premiums in theaggregate is approximately balanced by the expenditure on specific goods and services of money derived from claims which have been met during the sameperiod.24. As regards house purchase, we regard such payments as largely in thenature of investment rather than- of consumer expenditure. Nevertheless wethink it would be wrong if the weight for housing took account, in the case of owner-occupiers, only of outgoings such as rates, water charges, ground rents and repairs. In addition to these outgoings we think that the weight for housing should include some item to represent the net rental equivalent of theowner-occupiers&apos; dwellings. For this rental equivalent we propose following the same course as in the calculations for the National Income and Expendi-ture Statistics and have taken the gross Schedule A value of the dwellings withan adjustment to take account of changes in the average level of rents sincebefore the war.
V Construction of New Index groups and SectionsMain Groups25. We concluded that the main groups should be similar to those in thepresent index, with one exception. The existing index has nine main groups,one of which covers &quot; services &quot;. This is a large group, and hitherto thelargest section within this group has covered expenditure on travel. The costof travel will carry an even greater weight in the new index and, in addition,provision has now to be made for the quite considerable expenditure on private motoring recorded in the budgets. Accordingly we propose that ex-penditure on transport, including private motoring, should be treated as amain group. We also propose that the group at present described as &quot; rent and Rates &quot; should now be given the more comprehensive title &quot; Housing &quot;since this group will cover changes in payments for rent and rates and alsoin prices charged for repairs and maintenance incurred not only by owner-occupiers but also by tenants.26. The main groups into which the  index would be divided aretherefore:  	I.	FoodII.	Alcoholic DrinkIII.	TobaccoIV.	HousingV.	Fuel and LightVI.	Durable Household GoodsVII.	Clothing and FootwearVIII.	Transport and VehiclesXL	Miscellaneous GoodsX.	ServicesSections27. In the existing index the expenditure groups are divided into a numberof &quot; sections of which there are 50. The sections we propose for the newindex are a development of those now in use, but we think that, in the lightof the expenditure figures revealed by the 1953-54 enquiry, the composition of some of these sections must be altered and that a larger number of separate sections is needed, each carrying its appropriate weight. The numberof separately weighted sections we propose is roughly double the numbernow in use. The increase in the number of separately weighted sections,which is made possible by the more detailed information on householdspending now available from the 1953-54 enquiry, should add to the accuracy of the index. The Appendix shows the sections into which the main groupswould be divided.
VI Review of Items to be Priced28. When the index was last revised, in January 1952, certain additionswere made to the list of items to be regularly priced. With the help ofthe Technical Committee we have reviewed the complete list in the lightof the more up-to-date information about household spending now available.We suggest a number of further changes, mostly involving the pricing ofadditional items. The Appendix shows, for each of the proposed sections, alist of the items which we propose should be priced in future, and indicateswhich of these represent additions to the present list.29. In reviewing the list of items to be priced the Technical Committeegave special consideration to the item covering expenditure on meals boughtand consumed outside the home. In the first place there was good evidencefor concluding that this type of expenditure had not always been recordedor fully recorded in the budgets and after consultation with the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the Committee came to the conclusionthat, on the average, households had only recorded about two-thirds of theiractual expenditure on meals outside the home. When allowance is madefor this understatement, the weight for this item would be far fromnegligible. The Technical Committee reported that it was not possible toobtain, by direct measurement, a sufficiently reliable indication of the varia-tions from month to month in the charges for meals of unchanged qualityat restaurants, canteens and cafes. It was therefore necessary to considerwhich other price indicators could be used for this purpose and to allocate the weight for meals out to the sections of the index represented by theseprice indicators. One possibility would be to assume that variations frommonth to month in the charges for meals out are approximately in line with and can be represented by the movement of the index for the foodgroup as a whole. The variations in the charges for meals out do not,however, depend entirely on variations in prices of food. Another possibility would be to assume that changes in the prices of meals out are approximatelyin line with the movement of the index as a whole. This would imply that changes in food prices had a smaller effect on charges for meals out thanthe latest available evidence suggests. From such information as is availableto us, we assume that about one-half of this expenditure is accounted for bythe retail value of the food consumed. We therefore propose that one-halfof this expenditure should be assigned to the food group for the purpose ofweighting. The balance of the expenditure on meals out represents expendi-ture for which no satisfactory price indicator or group of price indicatorsis available and in our view it would be best to distribute this balance ofexpenditure on meals out proportionately over the weighting of the wholeindex. These proposals have been adopted in calculating the weights setout in the Appendix.30. While reviewing the list of items to be priced we should like to referagain to a misconception which we tried to remove in our last report, viz.,that the index &quot; covers &quot; only the price movements of the particular itemsfor which price enquiries are made and therefore leaves out of accountchanges in the prices of the numerous items in respect of which no enquiries are made. No price index can possibly attempt the task of regularly pricingevery commodity or service upon which money can be spent in a highly developed economy and the main task is to ensure that a selection of itemsis made which will provide a representative sample of price movements asa whole. In the proposed index there will be 91 separately weighted sectionsand for each of these sections a number of items have been selected forpricing.   The principle followed in selecting these items has been to choose
items whose price changes can be regarded as representative of the averagechange in the prices of the whole range of goods covered by the weightassigned to the section in question. Thus, in the section covering pricesof furniture, particulars of changes in the prices of 9 different items offurniture will be collected. This does not mean that price changes forother kinds of furniture are not covered by the index. The weight assigned to the furniture section relates to the total expenditure on all kinds offurniture and not simply to expenditure on the 9 kinds of furniture selected for pricing. Although there are only 9 price indicators for this section, theaverage price changes shown by these 9 indicators are regarded as represent-ing the average price changes for all kinds of furniture covered by the weight assigned to this section.VII Methods of Collecting Prices31. For items of food and for a number of other commodities and servicesprices are at present collected from retailers in 200 representative townsthroughout the United Kingdom. We recommend no change in these general arrangements. For items of furniture, floor coverings and various householdappliances, etc., in respect of which problems of quality variation may beof particular importance, prices are obtained by personal visits to variousretailers in 12 large urban areas. For these items it is more important toobtain good information on a limited basis than to obtain by post largenumbers of returns which may be less reliable. We recommend that theprices of these items should be collected as hitherto, but we suggest thatretailers in a number of additional towns should be asked to help so that prices should be available in all from about double, this number of largeurban areas. Apart from this, and the changes in the scope of the enquiries on rents which we suggest in later paragraphs, we would propose no changesin the areas from which prices are collected nor in the method of collection.32. Large numbers of retailers throughout the United Kingdom regularlycontribute information from which the index figures are calculated. this they do voluntarily and we should like to take this opportunity of placingon record our appreciation of the helpful and willing way in which this information is given.VIII Procedure for Computing the Index33. We regard the existing methods of computation as satisfactory andwe have no general changes to suggest. The problem of calculating theprice index for beer was discussed in our earlier &quot; Report on the Workingof the Interim Index of Retail Prices&quot;, dated 17th January, 1952, and pub-lished in March, 1952 (Cmd. 8481), and we have again considered thismatter. It is still our view that some allowance must be made for variations in the strength of beer in any index which purports to measure changes inthe prices of articles of unchanged quality. The Technical Committee have considered other methods of making allowance for such changes but they recommend that the existing procedure, which has worked well in practice and has the merit of being easily understood, should be continued, although they would not like to rule out the possibility of wishing to suggest some change on a future occasion. We agree with their proposal.
34. We wish, however, to suggest some modification in the method bywhich the information on changes in the prices of clothing, footwear and household textiles is summarised. At present the price changes for these items are calculated separately for each of four population groups, viz.:London ; other very large cities and towns ; intermediate sized towns ; smallertowns. Within each of these four groups the price relatives computed fromall the retailers&apos; returns for the item in question are averaged, each retailer&apos;sfigure carrying the same weight. Finally the four group averages for theitem are combined, again with equal weighting. In view of the importanceof multiple and department stores, we think it desirable that, instead of thepresent geographical method of combining the figures, separate figures shouldbe obtained for (a) multiple stores ; (b) department stores ; (c) co-operative societies ; and (d) other shops. Price relatives obtained by averaging within each of these four groups would be combined into a final index on the basisof their relative importance in national sales of clothing. Information ingroups (a) and (b) would be obtained on a national basis, but in the other two groups returns would be obtained, as at present, from towns in whichfood prices are collected. We suggest that this procedure should be kept under review for the purpose of adapting it to changing circumstances andparticularly of reducing the volume of returns required.35. Certain changes are now needed in the method of construction andcalculation of the index for the housing group. These are indicated in thefollowing section of our report.IX Index for the Housing Group36. The method of collecting information about changes in rents, includingrates and water charges, and of computing from this information the indexfigure for the rent component of the existing retail prices index was described in paragraphs 35-44 of the Technical Committee^ report which formed partof our &quot; Report on the Working of the Interim Index of Retail Prices&quot;.This rent component has hitherto measured changes in inclusive rents (i.e.,rents plus rates and water charges) of working-class dwellings let unfurnished.The weight assigned to rent covers payments for both unfurnished andfurnished accommodation, but no enquiries are made about changes infurnished rents and it is therefore assumed that changes in such rents are recovered by the measurement of changes in rents of unfurnished dwellings.No enquiries have been made about changes in the costs of maintenance,repairs, etc., by owner-occupiers or by tenants.37. The majority of working-class dwellings let unfurnished have beenprivately-owned dwellings subject to rent control but large numbers areowned by Local Authorities and the total of these dwellings has grownsteadily since the war. These post-war Local Authority dwellings are oftenlet at rents considerably higher than the average rents currently paid forpre-war dwellings and the increasing numbers of higher rents of these newerdwellings therefore give rise to an upward movement in the index. In effect,the rent index is obtained by comparing the average current rent of all renteddwellings now in occupation with the average rent in 1947 of the rathersmaller total of rented dwellings then in existence. Over this period theage depreciation of the older dwellings represents some fall in &quot; quality &quot;for which no adjustment is made in the index. On the other hand, no adjust-ment is made to take account of the improvement in average quality brought
about by the steady increase in the proportion of new dwellings in the totalstock of houses. If these two factors can *be assumed roughly to offset one another, the index can be said to approximate to a measure of changes inrents for a group of dwellings of constant age and quality distribution.38. Until 1954 the procedure followed did not necessitate direct enquiriesof tenants about changes in their rents. In those towns covered by the calculations the Ministry of Labour and National Service already possessedinformation about the numbers, rents and rateable values of rent-controlleddwellings and the operation of rent control legislation together with the stabilisation of rateable values had, until a year ago, operated in such a way that this information, once obtained, continued to be valid. Changes ininclusive rents of these controlled dwellings could be calculated from inform-ation regularly obtained as to changes in rate poundages and water charges.Local Authority dwellings were not subject to rent control and enquirieswere necessary at regular intervals to obtain from these Authorities detailsabout the numbers and inclusive rents of Local Authority dwellings. Withthe introduction, in 1954, of the Housing Repairs and Rents Acts (whichpermitted the net rents of rent-controlled dwellings to be raised in certaincircumstances), it was no longer possible to calculate the rent index inprecisely the same way as before and it became necessary to obtain supple-mentary information about the extent to which the rents of rent-controlleddwellings were changing. The Technical Committee were consulted aboutthe way in which this supplementary information should be obtained and ontheir advice it was decided to take a sample of those households which hadco-operated in the 1953-54 Household Expenditure Enquiry and whichoccupied rent-controlled accommodation, and to visit these households at regular intervals to ascertain whether and by how much their net rents had changed as a result of the operation of the new legislation. The averagepercentage by which the rents of this sample of households was changingwas then assumed to be indicative of the average change in the net rentsfor all rent-controlled dwellings in the towns covered by the rent index.It is now over a year since these visits began and the scheme has worked well in practice.39. The introduction of the new retail prices index provides a suitable opportunity for making a number of important changes in the method ofobtaining and summarising information for the purpose of the rent com-ponent of the index. Certain changes would have become inevitable evenif there had been no question of a new retail prices index. The informa-tion collected by the Ministry in past years about the numbers and rateablevalues of rent-controlled dwellings is now inadequate and, with the cominginto force (in England and Wales) of the new valuations in April, this information will become out-of-date. It is also necessary to ensure that ifthere were to be further changes in rent control legislation in future therewould be suitable machinery for obtaining immediate information about the ensuing changes in rents. In addition, it has been felt for some time that the enquiries concerning rents should be extended to cover a number of additionalareas.Direct Enquiries of Tenants40. The most satisfactory method of obtaining information about changesin rents in future is by direct enquiries of a representative sample of tenants.The amount of information needed from any tenant will be slight and sincerents do not change with great frequency it will not be necessary to make enquiries of the same tenants at monthly intervals.   Since the Ministry has
local offices throughout the whole of Great Britain it will be possible forthe necessary visits to tenants to be made by staff from these offices, andin Northern Ireland visits can be made by officers of the Ministry of Labourand National Insurance. In certain areas such enquiries have in fact beenmade following the passing of the Housing Repairs and Rents Acts in 1954,and it has been found that the tenants visited are quite willing to co-operate.The Sample of Tenants41. For the purpose of enquiries of this nature it is necessary to ensurethat the sample of tenants to be visited is a fully representative one. Inour view the recent household expenditure enquiry provides a large and representative sample of households living in privately-owned dwellings letunfurnished. It is proposed to visit a large proportion of these householdsat regular intervals in order to obtain particulars of such changes as occur in their rents, including rates and water charges. In the limited enquiriesof this kind which have been made since 1954 the sample of tenants to bevisited was &quot; staggered &quot; in such a way that some visits were made each monthbut each household was visited about once every six months. It is proposedto follow a similar plan with the more widespread enquiries we now recommended.Areas to be covered42. Between 1947 and 1954 enquiries about changes in rents were regularlymade in respect of the London County Council area and 45 other large citiesor towns. When it became necessary to start direct enquiries of tenants,following the passing of the Housing Repairs and Rents Acts in 1954, theopportunity was taken to extend the enquiries to other areas, and at presentthey are made in 84 urban areas in addition to the London County Councilarea. We consider that, for future enquiries, a number of smaller urban areas and rural areas should be included and that the enquiries, which havehitherto been confined to Great Britain, should be extended to coverNorthern Ireland. Apart from these changes, we regard the sample of areas as sufficient.Council Dwellings43. A considerable number of households to be covered by the new indexrent their dwellings from Local Authorities, Housing Trusts, etc. It is un-necessary to approach tenants of these dwellings for information about theirrents, rates and water charges, since this information can be obtained quitereadily from the Authorities concerned.Dwellings let furnished44. In 1947 and again in 1951 we considered that very serious difficulties would be encountered in attempting to measure the real changes in rents offurnished accommodation as distinct from variations in charges due tovariations in the &quot; quality &quot; of the accommodation priced. The technical committee have again considered this question. The 1953-54 HouseholdExpenditure Enquiry showed that under 3 per cent, of all the householdswhose budgets are to be used for weighting the new index rented furnished accomodation. The average amount paid by these households for furnished accomodation was roughly double the average expenditure on rent byhouseholds renting unfurnished dwellings, but the index is concerned with therelative movement of housing costs from month to month rather than withthe absolute level of expenditure.   In view of the practical difficulties of
measuring changes in rents of furnished accommodation and of the relatively small proportion of households concerned, it is the view of the technical committee that enquiries about rents should be confined, as in the past, tohouseholds renting unfurnished dwellings and that these enquiries will pro-vide a satisfactory guide to the percentage changes from period to period in the rents of both unfurnished and furnished dwellings. We agree withthis view.Owner-occupied Dwellings45. About 30 per cent, of the households whose budgets are to be usedfor weighting the new index own the dwellings in which they live: roughlyone-half of these households are in process of buying their dwellings. as stated in paragraph 24 of this report, we regard expenditure on the purchaseof houses, whether outright or by mortgage instalments, as being more inthe nature of investment than consumption expenditure. We have recom-mended, however, that the weight to be assigned to the housing group should include a figure representing the estimated rental equivalent of dwellingsowned by their occupiers. We suggest that the most appropriate priceindicator to be associated with this item would be changes in the indexfor the housing group as a whole. The simplest way of giving effect to thisis to distribute the weight for this estimated rental equivalent proportionatelyover the four sections distinguished in the housing group. This has beendone in calculating the weights shown in the Appendix.Costs of Maintenance and Repairs46. The 1953-54 enquiry showed that considerable sums were spent on repairs, decorations, etc., not only by owner-occupiers but also by householdsrenting dwellings. In view of this it will be necessary to measure thevariations from time to time in the average charges for house repairs anddecorations and in the prices charged for materials bought by occupiers doing their own work. As will be seen from the Appendix, provision is made forthis in the proposals for the new index.X Date of Introduction of New Index47. We recommend that the index should be calculated, as in the past,in respect of the prices ruling on the Tuesday nearest to the middle of each month. It is desirable that the new index should be brought into operation at the earliest possible date, and we recommend that, if possible, this date should be the beginning of 1956, prices at 17th January being taken as 100.The existing index was last revised as from January, 1952, and many statisticalcomparisons in the future would be made easier if the new index began inthe first month of the year. A further advantage of this course lies inthe fact that January is a month in which few prices are at abnormallyhigh or low levels on account of seasonal movements and January may therefore be regarded as a representative month for a base. If this proposals is accepted the first index in the new series would relate to prices at mid-February compared with those in force a month earlier (taken as 100), andthis first figure in the new series would be published in the March 1956 issueof the Ministry of Labour Gazette.
XI Comparisons with June 194748. For February 1956 and succeeding months the new index would therefore be calculated as an index with prices at January 1956 taken as 100.The figure so calculated will be the figure normally quoted as the officialindex figure. We recommend, however, that for a time there should alsobe a supplementary calculation in which the all items index figure in thenew series is linked with the corresponding figure for January 1956 in theexisting Interim Index in order to continue to show the change in theaverage level of retail prices since June 1947.49. Using the summarised details of the information recorded by thosehouseholds whose budgets would be used for the index if our proposals are accepted, the Technical Committee have calculated the appropriate weightsthat should be assigned to each of the main groups and to each of the 91sections. For alcoholic drink and tobacco the Committee have calculatedweights derived mainly from statistics of national expenditure on these itemsand only to a small extent from the details recorded in the budgets. Thereasons for this course have been indicated in paragraph 16 above. In making these calculations for alcoholic drink and tobacco the Technical committee made adjustments to allow for the exclusion of certain classes of householdsfrom those whose pattern of expenditure should be used for weighting theindex.50. If our proposals regarding the starting date of the new index are accepted, the index will measure changes in prices compared with the levelof prices in January 1956 taken as 100. The weights to be used in these calculations should therefore represent the relative expenditures recorded inthe 1953-54 budgets adjusted to the level of prices as at mid-January 1956.The weights so calculated for each group and section are shown in theAppendix. The weights for the main groups are set out in column (4) below.The weights in the present interim index are set out in column (2). Theyare based on 1950 consumption at January 1952 prices. In order to makea true comparison of the patterns of consumption represented by the twosets of weights, it is necessary to express the 1950 consumption and the1953-54 consumption in terms of prices at the same date. In the thirdcolumn of the table the 1950 pattern of consumption has been calculated atJanuary 1956 prices for the purpose of direct comparison with the figures in column (4).XII The Weights for the New IndexExisting Weights(1950 Consumption)New Weights(1953-54 Con-sumption) atJanuary 1956GroupAt AtJanuary 1952   January 1956(1)prices(4)Food .......Alcoholic Drink    ...Tobacco      .......Housing      .......Fuel and LightDurable Household GoodsClothing and FootwearTransport and VehiclesServices      .......Miscellaneous Goods39978907266629844914326980737355844094350718087556610659All items,0001,0001,000
51. The differences between the two patterns of consumption shown above in columns (3) and (4) are almost entirely a reflection of three factors. Inthe first place, the new weights are based on the pattern of consumption in1953 whereas the existing weights relate to the pattern of consumption in1950; the proposed weights therefore reflect changes in the pattern of consumption between 1950 and 1953. Secondly, the new weights are cal-culated from the actual budgets obtained in the new expenditure enquiry,whereas the existing weights were derived from the results of the 1937-38enquiry adjusted by rough estimates of the changes between 1937-38 and1950. Thirdly, the new weights relate to a wider group of consumers thanthe pre-war group of insured contributors which has hitherto been used.There are also some differences arising from changes in the classification ofparticular items.conclusions. We recommend that the existing Interim Index of Retail Prices shouldbe terminated and that a new index, to be called the Index of Retail Prices,be instituted as from January, 1956, to show future monthly changes inthe level of retail prices compared with the level in January, 1956, taken as 100.2. The weights for the new index would be based on the pattern ofexpenditure revealed by the 1953-54 Household Expenditure Enquiry. Wehave examined the information available from this enquiry and we aresatisfied that it will provide a reliable and representative basis for calculating the weighting pattern for the new index.3. The new index would be designed to measure average price changesfor households which would include practically all wage earners and smalland medium salary earners. For this purpose we recommend that thebudgets supplied by all classes of households should be used with theexception of :-(a) those from households the head of which had a recorded grossincome in 1953 of  20 a week or more, and(b) those from households in which at least three-quarters of the total income was derived from National Insurance retirement or similarpensions and/or National Assistance paid in supplementation orinstead of such pensions.The households whose budgets would be used to provide weights wouldreflect the expenditure pattern of nearly nine-tenths of all households in theUnited Kingdom.4. We recommend that the new index should be sub-divided into 10 maingroups and that these groups should be divided into 91 sections. The weightsto be assigned to each of these groups and sections are shown in theAppendix.5. In the light of the information supplied in the budgets, we have reviewed the list of items to be priced for the index. We recommend the additionof a number of items to the list used for the present index. The Appendixshows the complete list of items for which we recommend that prices shouldbe collected.6. In general we regard the existing methods of collecting and summarisingprices as satisfactory and suitable for the new index. Certain modificationsare suggested principally in regard to the method of obtaining information for the purpose of the housing group of the index.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,W. J. Neden, Chairman.On behalf of the Committee.23rd February, 1956.
