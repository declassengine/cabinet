UHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAIESTY!S GOVERNMENT).   SECRETCP. (56) 5427th February, 1956.cabinet report CF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ONSETTING, LOTTERIES AND GAMINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs on 31st January the Cabinet invited me to circulate a draftof an announcement to be made in the House of Commons of the Govern-ment5s intention to give effect to the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming and, in preparing it, totake into account any trend of opinion on this subject which might havebeen disclosed in the Debate in the House of Lords on 8th February(CCM0(56) 8th Conclusions, Minute 8).     The intention then was that anannouncement should be deferred until the legislative programme forthe next Session had been reviewed as a whole.2. A Motion is to be moved in the House of Commons on Friday,9th March, in the following terms s-&quot;Mr. Arthur Lewis   -BETTING AND LOTTERIES ?  That this Housetakes note of the Report of the Royal Commission onBetting, Lotteries and Gaming;  welcomes the Commission^exposition of the anomalies which exist in the present laws;and invites the Government to consider introducingcomprehensive legislation which will enable betting to becorrectly and fairly conducted without discrimination between one sport and another in the interests of the british public and the sports concerned&quot;.The members of the House of Lords who spoke in the Debate on 8th February (including two Bishops) started from various standpoints.But all came out in favour of the Royal Commission^ recommendation that cash betting offices for off-the-course betting should be established.Several members spoke as opponents of gambling, but said that asbetting could not be stopped, it should be controlled.    Press comment on the Debate has been largely of the same opinion, and the generalreaction has suggested that, legislation will arouse less controversy than has been feared.3. In this changed climate of opinion, I do not think an announce-ment of Government intentions can any longer be delayed.    If mycolleagues agree, I would therefore propose that I should make an announcment in this Debate on the lines set out in the Annex to this paper.    It isalso, in my opinion, desirable that steps should be taken to draft thenecessary legislation so that it can be introduced at the earliest opportunitCOPY N00 jfSj
(a) for approval to make an announcement onthe lines set out in the Annex during thecourse of the Debate on 9th March;and(b) that authority should be given for parliamentary Counsel to draft thenecessary legislation.G. LL. -G.Home Office, S.W.1.25th February, 1956.ANNEXLines of proposed statement on betting and gaming1, The Government accept the main recommendations ofthe Royal Commission that  -(a) bookmakers should be registered;(b) off-the-course cash betting by post should bemade lawful;(c) licensed betting offices to which the publicmay resort should be established;(d) sterner penalties should be provided againstthe receiving of cash bets off the course inany other way;(e) the law of gaming should be repealed and replaced by a law more in accordance with modern conditions.2.
