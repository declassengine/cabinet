Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1956Copy No.    g CABINETDEATH PENALTY (ABOLITION) bill memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister for Welsh affairs and the Secretary of State for scotland the purpose of this paper is to seek a decision on the attitude which theGovernment should take towards the amendments to the Death Penalty (Abolition)Bill. Leaving aside merely wrecking amendments, the amendments at present onthe Order Paper, which are summarised in Appendix I, fall into two classes (i) amendments designed to retain capital punishment for certain classesof murder, and(ii) amendments designed to amend the law of murder in the directionssuggested by the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment and/or theHeald Committee.Amendments Designed to Retain Capital Punishment for Certain Classes of Murder2. These amendments present the Government. with a difficult problem.Government spokesmen have repeatedly stated in the House that the choice liesbetween the retention and the abolition of capital punishment. The Lord privy seal and the Home Secretary both said in the debate on 16th February, 1956, thatthe Government did not think that the problem could be solved by attempting to define murder or degrees of murder. Once a departure is made from total abolitionor total retention anomalies are bound to arise because there are no logical ormoral grounds for distinguishing between one category of murder and another.Because, however, the Government would not have been prepared to initiatelegislation to limit capital punishment to particular categories of murder, it doesnot necessarily follow that we should oppose amendments designed to exceptcertain categories of murder from the abolition of capital punishment.3. As Secretaries of State we are responsible for the maintenance of law andorder and we have a special position in relation to the services by which law andorder is maintained, the police and prison services. The members of both look tous to defend their interests, and it would be extremely undesirable, in view of thedifficulty of recruiting for both these services, to give them the impression thatwe are indifferent to the increased danger to which the abolition of capital punishment will expose them. We feel that, in view of our special responsibilities,we cannot oppose amendments specifically intended to protect policemen andprison officers.4. We therefore propose that the Government should support amendmentsdesigned to preserve capital punishment as the penalty for (i) the murder of a police constable in the execution of his duty, and(ii) the murder of a prison officer by a prisoner.5. We recognise that these amendments will create anomalies. There is nological distinction between murdering a night-watchman and murdering apoliceman, or between murdering a prison officer in prison or a civilian outsidein the course of escape, and the public would probably not regard murdering apoliceman or a prison officer as so heinous a crime as murder by poisoning. EvenSECRETCP. (56) 9229th March, 195649745
poisoners, however, are not all of the same degree of wickedness; there is a widedifference between the mother who gives an overdose of aspirin to an ailing childand, for example, the nurse who kills by slow poisoning some elderly person whosemoney she hopes to inherit. We do not, therefore, propose that capital punishmentshould be retained for poisoners: we merely draw attention to the difficulty which any attempt to select particular forms of murder which attract the capital penaltyis bound to create.6. It may be observed that in relation to offences against prison officers thereis already a precedent for keeping a special penalty, at any rate in England andWales, since corporal punishment has been retained specifically for mutiny orincitement to mutiny and gross personal violence to a prison officer.7. We feel that there may also be grounds for supporting the amendments to retain the death penalty for second or subsequent convictions of murder. Suchcases have hitherto&apos; been rare: but with the general abolition of the death penaltymore murderers will eventually be at large and it may be felt that society is entitledto such special protection against the risk of a repetition of their crime as the death penalty would afford. If Parliament decided not to retain the death penalty forany murder of a prison officer, the case for its retention for a second or subsequentmurder would be even stronger because of the special risk to which prison officers would then be exposed from persons who are already serving a life sentence and upon whom no further sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. We feel that,on any ground, an amendment keeping the death penalty for a second orsubsequent murder is one which the Government could not easily oppose.8. The amendments which we suggest should be supported do not represent an attempt to single out crimes of particular heinousness. They would, however,provide some protection for two classes of public servant who, by the nature oftheir service, are specially exposed to murderous attack, and for the communityat large from the risk of a further murder by a person who has shown himselfby a previous conviction to be capable of such a crime.9. We do not suggest that the Whips should be put on for these amendments,but we hope that all Ministers who can conscientiously support them will do so. Asto the remaining amendments in this category, we suggest that the Governmentshould not indicate any view upon them and that we should decide on the spot inthe light of the progress of the debate whether to vote for them or to abstain.Amendment to the Law of Murder10. There are a number of amendments on the Order Paper designed toamend the law of murder on the test of insanity, diminished responsibility andprovocation by words alone. Most of these follow the lines recommended by theHeald Committee.11. If capital punishment is abolished, either wholly or with exceptionswhich will affect only a minority of cases, there is no immediate need to amend the law of murder since the penalty will normally be indefinite detention, whetherthe verdict is murder, manslaughter or guilty but insane or with diminishedresponsibility. In particular, there would be little object in amending the law ofinsanity or introducing the doctrine of diminished responsibility into English lawexcept as a means of exempting abnormal persons from sentence of death. In ourview, therefore, this group of amendments should be opposed on the ground thatthis Bill is not the appropriate instrument for amending the law of murder andthat that law should be considered later in the light of the form in which the Bill iseventually passed.Amendment to except Scotland from the scope of the Bill12: A large group of Scottish Members have put down an amendment toexcept Scotland from the scope of the Bill. We think that this should be resisted.There are no arguments of principle which apply in one country and not in theother. Further it would be an absurd position if capital punishment were abolishedin one part of Great Britain and retained in another so that a would-be murdererin Scotland who wanted to avoid capital punishment had only to inveigle hisvictim across the border in order to do so. On this matter the law must clearly be changed on both sides of the border or on neither.
13. The position of Northern Ireland is different. Law and order are amatter for the Northern Ireland Parliament on which it would not be appropriate for the Westminster Parliament to legislate. -Government Amendments .14. It will be the duty of the Government to ensure that the Bill leaves theHouse of Commons in a workmanlike form. Appendix 2 contains a list of amendments which it will be necessary to table at some stage. We suggest thatthose marked with an asterisk, which are designed to correct the draft as it now stands, should be put down in Committee and that the remainder, which addsomething to the Bill, should be reserved for Report.Conclusion15.   We recommend (1) that the Government should support while leaving to a free voteamendments designed to retain capital punishment for (a) the murder of a police constable in the execution of his duty,(b) the murder of a prison officer by a prisoner, and(c) a second conviction of murder;(2) that the Government should not express any opinion on the remainingamendments designed to retain capital punishment for certain classesof murder and should decide how to vote in the light of the discussion in Committee;(3) that amendments designed to exclude Scotland from the ambit of the bill and to amend the law of murder should be opposed,(4) that the Government should, at an appropriate stage, put down amend-ments on the points set out in Appendix 2 to this paper.G. LL.-G.J. S.28th March, 1956.Appendix summary OF PRIVATE MEMBERS&apos; AMENDMENTS TO THE death penalty (ABOLITION) bill. Amendment designed to ensure that a life sentence means that the prisoneris actually detained for the whole of his natural life.  (Mr. Rees-Davies and others.)2.

Appendix government AMENDMENTS TO THE DEATH PENALTY(ABOLITION) BILL*1. Delete references to suspension of the death penalty in the long title,in Clause 1 (1) and Clause 2 (2), converting the Bill into a simple Abolition Bill.2.   In the application of the Bill to Scotland *(a) amend Clause 1 (1) so as to refer not only to enactments requiring acourt to pronounce sentence of death but to a rule of law. This isnecessary because in Scotland the death penalty is not statutory andthere must be a specific provision enabling the High Court to passsentence of life imprisonment;*(b) delete the reference to penal servitude in Clause 1 (3);*(c) extend Clause 1 (1) to cases of shooting, stabbing, strangling, poisoning,&amp;c, with intent to murder or disable in which, if death had resulted,the crime would have been murder. These cases attract the death penalty in Scots law, although the Lord Advocate has power to prevent it being imposed.3. Add to Clause 1 a new sub-section providing that the Bill extend tocourts-martial wherever sitting but shall not otherwise apply to courts outsideGreat Britain. (The death penalty will be retained for the service offences otherthan murder for which it is prescribed.)4. Add a new clause empowering the Secretary of State, after considering a report by three doctors appointed for the purpose to order the removal toBroadmoor Institution of any person sentenced to imprisonment for life afterconviction of murder.Mr. Martin Lindsay and others that the death penalty should be kept forthe murder of a policeman or prison officer on duty.Mr. Yates and others that the death penalty should be kept for the murder of a serving or retired policeman, prison officer, security officer orjudge, and for a second conviction of murder.Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth and others that the death penalty should be keptfor murder committed by a lethal weapon in the course of burglary, house-breaking or robbery or by a life prisoner.Mr. Philip Bell and others that the death penalty should be kept for murder by poison or other destructive thing.Mr. Turner-Samuels and others that the death penalty should be keptfor a deliberate and calculated murder or a murder resulting from the use of firearms or dangerous weapons.5. Amendments designed to introduce the doctrine of diminishedresponsibility into the law of England and to enable a jury to reduce murder tomanslaughter on being satisfied of provocation by words alone.
