THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-WM Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1956 mmW,H SECRET Copy No. 28 ^|2P//? February, 1956CABINETCHINESE NATIONALIST AIRCRAFT IN HONG KONGwmwm Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies ^LwM^mWM The Problem ^mwM^mWM On 31st January, 1956, a Chinese Nationalist aircraft fitted with photographic^mWM equipment and rocket-racks, but not otherwise armed, landed in Hong Kong after ^mWM^mWM apparently running out of fuel and /or having engine trouble during an operational m\wMwMwM H        mission over the mainland of China.  The pilot was the only occupant.   The ^mWm^mWM Chinese Communist Government has asked that the aircraft and crew be detained ^mwMWmwm in Hong Kong and has reserved the right to put forward further views on the^mwM I          incident. The Nationalist authorities in Formosa have asked that the aircraft and^mwM pilot be returned to them.  The aircraft and pilot are at present still detained mwMMWmwM in Hong Kong. The Governor of Hong Kong has informed us that he has power^mwm to detain the aircraft under Regulation No. 50 of the Emergency (Principal) mwMW.^mwM Regulations, 1949, but no power to detain the pilot.^mwm 2.   We now have to decide whether the pilot should be returned alone to^mwM Formosa, whether the aircraft should be serviced and released with him or detainedWmwM i       without him, or whether both pilot and aircraft should be detained either for a^mwM short period or indefinitely.^mwM The Possibilities^mwM Slate of Belligerency WMmWWmwM 1            3.   Detention of an aircraft and its crew belonging to another Power wouldWmwm be justified under international law only if a state of belligerency were recognisedWmwM as existing between that Power and a third Power.   The Foreign Office have^mwM considered the recognition of a state of belligerency between Nationalist andWMWE Communist China.  They conclude that such recognition is undesirable because^mwM the hostilities are not on a scale sufficient to justify it under international law andWmwM because it would have overriding practical disadvantages, since in that event the^mwM Chinese Nationalists could legitimately interfere with British shipping, CommunistWmwM China would resent the recognition accorded to the Nationalists (a two-ChinaWmwm policy) and the Governor&apos;s present discretion to treat each incident on its meritsWmwM would be replaced by rigid duties very difficult to avoid and perhaps sometimes^mwM inconvenient to carry out.^mwM Release Pilot, Detain Aircraft ^mmm\^mWM 4.  The advantages of this action are that it would be within the presentWwMy emergency powers of the Governor and that it would serve as a gesture of^mwm disapproval to warn off intruders from either side for the future. The disadvantageWmwM w     is that it would displease both sides in the conflict, the Communists because the^mwM pilot was being released, and the Nationalists because the aircraft was beingWmwM detained.  The Governor favours this course of action because of its deterrentU%mJ value, but recognises the difficulty of justifying it internationally; he has suggested^mwM that an advisory opinion might be sought from the International Court of Justice,wmwrn 9    but it has been decided that this would not be possible because under the UnitedMMm B..&apos;**^?ations Charter Governments cannot seek advisory opinions.uuuu
m\\\\BVh              Release Pilot and Aircraft without Warning for Future ^k\\A^L\\\                   5.  The pilot and aircraft could be released and interested parties could be ????^k-W              told or allowed to assume that the same practice would be followed in future ^k-WftVM              incidents.   This would have the advantage that it is the normal international ^k-%M^k-m           &gt; practice except when a state of belligerency has been recognised; and the iHfl^k-W              maintenance of this principle is useful to Her Majesty&apos;s Government elsewhere ^k-9MftVM              in the world. Its disadvantages would be that it would annoy the Chinese ^k-W^k-W Communist Government and might increase the risk of their violating Hong Kong aHfl^k-m              airspace with impunity and depressing the morale of the population.-                        fl ^L\m\^k-W               Release Pilot and Aircraft with Warning for Future UKWM^k-W                    6.  The pilot and the aircraft could be released and interested parties be ^k-WWKWm               told one of two things: - IHYfl^k-W (a) that this action had been taken in accordance with normal internationalftVM practice but that if in future Hong Kong&apos;s facilities were considered^k-W                            to be deliberately abused-e.g., by frequent repetition of such incidents mAWM^k-W                            from any quarter-the Hong Kong Government would hold itself free ^k-9Mkvb                            to take whatever action it deemed necessary to deal with such abuses; ^k-WMmmm m\\m\^LyW                    (b) that this action has been taken in accordance with normal international ^LMWWMMM practice but that the same practice would not be adopted in future.Instead the Hong Kong Government would at once take measures ^k-W^k-W                            under emergency powers to detain indefinitely aircraft or vessels and ^k-9MWMMM                             their crews which might come within the jurisdiction of the Colony^k-W                            while engaged in warlike acts.WMMM To return both the pilot and the aircraft with one of these warnings would havethe advantages that in the present case normal international practice was being ^k-W^k-W               adopted and that the warning should minimise the risk of deliberate or careless ^k-9MWMMM               interference by either side in the future; it would also enable the Governor to BVEjretain a good deal of discretion in settling future incidents.   Its disadvantage ^k-WM^Lkm               would be that it would annoy the Chinese Communist Government and perhaps ^k-WMwMMM               make that Government more actively hostile to Hong Kong. IHYfl^k-W               Detain both Pilot and A1 fcraft briefly or indefinitely ^L\\\^L\\\                    7.  This course of action would have the advantage of being a powerful mWMmm^LwM               gesture of disapproval and a deterrent to both sides from allowing such incidents ^k\\\BVM               to happen again; the deterrent value might not amount to much if the aircraft ^LwMwere detained only for a short time. The disadvantages would be that the people WMMMMof Hong Kong would interpret the decision as a concession to the Chinese ^k-WMkvb               Communist Government and a demonstration of that Government&apos;s influence, ^k-WMthat the Chinese Nationalists would be seriously offended and possibly provoked wawminto harassing British shipping even more than at present, that the physical presencekvb of the pilot and aircraft would be inconvenient to the Hong Kong authorities aslong as they remained and that the impression might wrongly be given to other ^k-WMcountries that the decision implied a recognition of a state of belligerency (with the ^k-WMWMMM legal and practical difficulties mentioned in paragraph 3 above). Last, and perhapsleast of the difficulties, the Governor would have to make a fresh application of ^L-9Mhis emergency powers to legalise the detention of the pilot. ^k-WM^L-m RecommendationwXWM 8.  No ideal course of action can be suggested; all have disadvantages and      KVJ KVfl^L-W               may offend either the Chinese Communist Government or Nationalist Formosa ^k-WM^k-W or both. In my view, and I understand this to be shared by the Foreign Office, ^k-WMW-Wm               the course of action offering least offence and minimising the risk of future trouble        U KVAVis that mentioned in paragraph 6(a) above.  Such action should also appear fair^k-m to the world in general, because a fair warning would have been given, in the ^k*WMW-WM                absence of an exact precedent, before any drastic action was taken in future.&apos;f^^      I KVflColonial Office, S.W. 1,KVfl                            22nd February, 1956. ^k\\\
