Economic Survey 1956(1) THE WORLD background. In 1955 world economic conditions were highly favourable. output was growing rapidly in all the major manufacturing countries, and trade between them was increasing at an exceptional rate. The general levelof commodity prices was little different from the average of 1954. the primary producing countries remained on the whole prosperous and con-tinued to provide good markets for manufactured goods. The outflow of gold and dollars from the United States, while smaller than in 1953 or 1954,continued at a high rate of over 1^ billion dollars a year.2. The outstanding feature of 1955 was the steady and powerful expan-sion in the level of output of the major manufacturing countries. In western europe there was a continuation of the rapid rise in output which had started in 1953 ; and highly prosperous conditions spread over the continent andabsorbed most of the resources which had still remained unemployed atthe beginning of the year. The use of previously unemployed resources,together with the fruits of large scale investment in plant and machinery in earlier years, made it possible for continental European industrial output to rise by about 11 per cent, above 1954 levels. The rate of growth inGermany, which was about 16 per cent, from 1954 to 1955, was particularlystriking, but in none of the major industrial countries of continental western europe did industrial output expand by less than 7 per cent, over the previous year, nor in any of tihem are there yet any indications of any substantial reduction in the rate of growth. The rapid expansion has largely been concentrated on the metal using industries, such as engineering and motor cars.The textile industries have not, in general, played any part in the expansion in European output.3. The continued expansion of the United States economy, following the recovery from the 1953-54 recession, has been equally striking. Industrialoutput was 11 per cent, higher at the end of 1955 than at the end of 1954.Mainly as a result of this increase, the gross national product of the UnitedStates increased between 1954 and 1955 by 7 per cent., a rate considerably greater than can be expected year in year out.4. These boom conditions in Europe and the United States produced atendency to rising prices of manufactured goods towards the end of 1955.In a number of countries restraining measures were taken, especially inthe field of monetary policy.5. The growth in output of all the major manufacturing countries ofthe world was accompanied by a sharp rise in the level of trade betweenthem. In the first nine months of 1955, this trade was 16 per cent, higherthan in the corresponding period of 1954. The increase was mainly asso-ciated with the increases in output and incomes outlined above, accentuated
in some countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom, by theneed to import goods such as steel and coal of which home output provedinsufficient. A growing volume of supplies of fuel and materials wasimported from North America into Western Europe. Policies of tradeliberalisation and the freedom permitted by high levels of foreign exchangereserves of most countries also contributed to the growth of trade betweenmanufacturing countries.6. Generally speaking, in primary producing countries incomes did notrise in 1955 as rapidly as in the industrial countries. Total sales by the primary producers to the manufacturing countries (which account for much the larger part of their exports) increased relatively little, compared with thegrowth of world trade as a whole ; in the second half of 1955 however theirsales rose substantially above the level of a year earlier.7. There were, however, significant differences between the primary pro-ducing countries. Their total sales to the manufacturing countries rosecomparatively little because most of them rely mainly on exports of foodstuffs,beverages and textile materials, markets for which were in general ratherweak. The most striking falls were in the prices of coffee and cocoa, butthe prices of other foodstuffs also tended to fall during 1955, and pricesof textile raw materials were rather low compared with 1954. On the otherhand, the prices of many industrial raw materials used by the rapidly expand-ing industries (in particular the non-ferrous metals and rubber) rose con-siderably during the year. Those primary producing countries which selllarge quantities of these commodities were able to increase their exportearningssubstantially between 1954 and 1955. Many of these countries are in the overseas sterling area (e.g. Malaya and the Federation of Rhodesia andNyiasaland), so the exports of the overseas sterling area as a whole increasedmuch more in 1955 than those of the other primary producers.8. Although the export earnings of the primary producers grew by relatively small amounts in 1955, these countries taken as a group remained goodexport markets, in many cases because they allowed their foreign exchangereserves to decline. The rate of increase of their imports was high in thefirst half of the year, but fell off later.9. As a result of the continued flow of dollars from the United states to the rest of the world, the total gold and dollar holdings of the non-dollarworld rose substantially during the year. The flow from the United States,together with the output of new gold, transactions with the Soviet bloc and net changes in private holdings of gold and dollars, resulted in an increasein the total official gold and dollar reserves of countries outside the soviet bloc of some $F6 billion during 1955.(2) DEVELOPMENTS  AT  HOME10. In 1955 demand and incomes rose even more rapidly than in 1954.Production, on the other hand, rose less rapidly. In consequence the economy was overstrained and the balance of payments suffered.11. The value of the gross national product rose by about  1,000 millions,or 6X2 per cent., between 1954 and 1955. Details are shown in Table 1.But about half of the increase in the value of home output was due to higher prices. Table 2 sets out in constant prices the changes in expenditure and supplies between 1953 and 1955.

A number of the estimates given in the latter publication have been revised in this paper.(2) Before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation.12. Total expenditure, including exports, rose by  860 millions at 1954prices between 1954 and 1955. This increase in expenditure was nearly  100millions greater than the increase between 1953 and 1954. It was met by a rather smaller increase in home output than occurred in the previous year,and by a much larger increase in imports. Home output went up by  525millions at 1954 prices, or jr.- per cent.: this was  75 millions less thanthe increase in 1954, mainly as a result of the less rapid growth of industrial production which is discussed in paragraph 21 below. The remainder of the increase in total expenditure was met by an increase of  335 millions in imports of goods and services. This compares with an increase of  165millions in 1954. In 1955 additional imports met nearly 40 per cent, of thetotal increase in expenditure against only about 20 per cent, in the previous year. The abnormally large rise in imports reflects the excess of demand.13. On the expenditure side, the most important difference between 1954and 1955 was that fixed investment other than housing rose twice as muchin 1955 as in 1954: by about  200 millions instead of  100 millions.Expenditure on housebuilding, after a very slight rise in 1954, declinedin 1955. The increase in investment in stocks and work in progress in 1955was three times larger than the increase in 1954. Consumers&apos; expenditure and exports each rose almost as much as in the previous year. expenditure by public authorities fell by much the same amount as in 1954.

Fixed investment14. There was a substantial rise in fixed investment in 1955. The increase is estimated at  155 millions (at 1954 prices) of over 6 per cent., despite a fall of  40 millions in house-building. Public investment in housing declinedsharply, and there was a small rise in private building: altogether 324,000new houses were completed in 1955. Other new building rose by nearly 13per cent. But the most striking increase in fixed investment was in plant,machinery, and vehicles^1) Expenditure on these goods rose by 10 per cent,between 1954 and 1955. Table 3 sets out estimates of investment by typeof asset for the years 1951 to 1955 in constant 1948 prices. Between 1951and 1953 the increase in investment was mainly in housing; it is only since1953 that industrial investment has been rising substantially, while investment in housing, after levelling off, has now turned down. These movements canbe seen in the charit below.GROSS FIXED SNViAT 1948 PRICES600400zoooPLANT AND  MACHINERYOTHER NEW buildings and   WORKSNEW DWELLINGSVEHICLES, SHIPS ANDAIRCRAFT1951195219531954195515. Expenditure on investment by different industry groups for the past five years is also shown (in constant 1948 prices) in Table 3. Over halfthe total increase in fixed investment between 1954 and 1955 took place in manufacturing industry. Within this group the motor and the paper and printing indusitriies achieved the most substantial increases: the level of invest -menit by the imiotor industry in 1955 was about double that in 1954.(&apos;) This item includes ships, aircraft and passenger cars bought for business purposes.
Investment in stocks and work in progress v16. Estimates of the movements in stocks and work in progress in the economy as a whole are particularly uncertainC1). However, as shown inTable 2, stockholding is likely to have been considerably greater in 1955than in 1954, largely as a result of the increase in stocks and work in progressheld by manufacturing industry. Perhaps about one-half of the total increasein manufacturers&apos; stocks occurred in the metal using industries.17. About  100 millions worth of stocks were disposed of by Governmentdepartments, in particular, oils and fats, sugar, carcase meat, cheese and non-ferrous metals, and by the Raw Cotton Commission, and there was little or no offset to this fall in the recorded stocks of these commodities held by private traders and manufacturers. In cotton, a marked fall in stocks tookplace over the year. On the other hand, in a number of commodities, stocks were built up. Tobacco stocks increased by 37 million pounds and recordedstocks of softwood rose by 130,000 standards. With the help of substantialimports, stocks of coal were also built up by about 4 million tons, and stocksof steel held by producers, consumers and merchants are estimated to have risen by nearly 750,000 tons.Government expenditure18. Total current expenditure on goods and services by public authoritiesfell slightly in real terms in 1955. Civil expenditure by the Central Govern-ment and local authorities rose slightly, mainly on account of health servicesand education: the school population was larger, particularly in the secondary schools, and more teachers were employed. The increase incivil expenditure was slightly more than offset by a fall in defence expenditure.This resulted in the main from a decline in expenditure on military equip-ment and supplies and partly from a reduction in the numbers serving i&apos;n theForces.Personal income and expenditure19. All main categories of personal income rose substantially in 1955, andby more in each case than in 1954.  Estimates are given in Table 4.

vyand salaries went up by 8  per cent.: a little of this was due to a rise ofabout \\ per cent, in employment and some increase in hours worked, but most came from higher rates of pay. The incomes of self-employed persons. rose by 7 per cent.; rent, dividends and interest received by persons roseby 1\ per cent. In total, personal income increased by 8 per cent, in 1955compared with a rise of 6 per cent, in 1954. Tax payments and national insurance contributions were also higher, leaving disposable income 8-J percent,, or  1,065 millions, higher than in 1954. Consumers&apos; expenditure isestimated to have risen by about  960 millions, suggesting that personalsavings (derived purely as a residual and hence a very uncertain figure)remained at about 7 or 8 per cent, of disposable income, the same proportion as in each year since 1952.20. Of the 8 per cent, rise in consumers&apos; expenditure between 1954 and1955, about half was absorbed by a 4 per cent, rise in the prices of con-sumers&apos; goods and services. Thus for the third year in succession the risein consumers&apos; real expenditure was about 4 per cent. Table 5 gives estimates for a number of recent years, all in 1948 prices so that they may be corn-pared. In 1948 prices the total rise in consumption between 1954 and 1955amounted to about  360 millions, slightly less than the rise from 1953 to1954. About one-third of the total real increase in consumption consisted of food, drink and tobacco. In current prices, expenditure on food wentup by about 1\ per cent. This is accounted for mainly by a rise in food prices. The volume of food consumption (i.e. its value at 1948 prices) rose byabout one per cent., but this probably ignores some improvement in quality.Table 6 sets out the composition of total food consumption in recent years.Consumption of meat and sugar inoreased further in 1955. Consumptionof tea and of cereals declined slightly. In terms of energy value, fat content and animal protein, food, consumption in 1955 was the highest yet recorded.There was a substantial rise in consumption of alcoholic drink. Themost spectacular increase in expenditure was on private motoring, amountingto more than one-quarter of the total rise i&apos;n real expenditure, and nearlytwice as large an increase as that between 1953 and 1954. On the otherhand, ithe high rate of increase in expenditure on household goods pre^vailing at the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955 was not sustained.Partly as a result of Government measures to restrict hire purchase buying,expenditure on household goods in the second half of 1955 was little higherthan in the second half of 1954.Table 5Consumers&apos; expenditure		  million at 1948			Per cent.			prices			change						1953 to	1954 to	1952	1953	1954	1955	1954	1955Food        ...      .........	2,&apos;421	2,498	2,593	2,635	4-4	4- 1Alcoholic drink    .........	837	851	861	912	4- 1	4- 6Tobacco	782	794	811	832	-1- 2	4- housing, fuel and light   ......	1,157	1,176	1,218	1,250	+ 4	4- 3Household goods.........	634	713	801	838	+ 12	4- 6Clothing and footwear   ......	874	891	932	973	4- 5	4- other goods        .........	476	515	545	558	4- 6	4- 2Private motoring and cycling P) ...	221	279	333	428	+ 19	4-29Miscellaneous services   .......	1,336	1,353	1,373	1,385	+ 2	4- 1Total     ......	8,738	9,070	9,467	9,825	+41	4- 40) Net expenditure on new and second-hand vehicles and running costs.

Industrial production rose by 5 per cent, between 1954 and 1955compared with a rise of 7 per cent, between 1953 and 1954. Moreover,most of the rise took place at the end of 1954 and early in 1955: there wasa marked slackening of the rate of increase of the index of production during1955. Table 7 and the chart on page 13 show where the main increasesoccurred. The metals and metal using industries accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total increase in industrial output (in 1954 they provided onlyone-half of the larger total rise). As in 1954 the most marked increases werein production of motor vehicles and metal consumer goods, but for the latterthe trend appeared to weaken towards the end of the year, possibly in response to weakening home demand (see paragraph 20 above). Productionof plant and machinery expanded at an increased rate, but demand increasedeven more rapidly, and as a result orders on hand rose throughout the year.Outside the metal using industries most of the increases were rather smaller than in 1954: in particular, the output of chemicals and paper and printing,which expanded very fast in 1954, increased more slowly in 1955. A fall in coal output resulted in an actual decline in the index of mining and quarryingproduction. The output of the building and contracting industry increasedslightly. Clothing output rose a little during the year but this was almost exactly offset by a fall in textile output, concentrated in cotton textiles, sothat on balance the output of the textiles and clothing industries remained unchanged.

22. From Table 8 some idea can be gained of how different types ofexpenditure affected the output of different industries in 1955. increased exports and consumers&apos; expenditure each accounted for about one-third ofthe increase in industrial output, and increased fixed investment for slightly less than one-quarter. Most of the rise occurred in the metals, engineering and vehicles industries. Nearly all of the increased output used in higherfixed investment and most of that induced by higher exports came fromthese industries. Furthermore, nearly three-fifths of the increased industrialoutput to satisfy consumers&apos; demand came from the metals, engineering and vehicles industries. It is clear from the foregoing paragraphs that the total increase in expenditure in 1955 was concentrated much more heavily on asingle sector-itihe metals and engineering industries &quot;than was the case in1954, as a result of a large expansion in investment, increased private buyingof cars and a higher level of exports. This concentration of demand placeda heavy load upon the metal using industries. These industries attractedtwo-thirds of the increase in civil employment and yet vacancies rose inThe relation between changes in final expenditure and changes in industrialoutput between 1954 and 1955(?)Table 8   million at 1954 factor cost	Changes in net output of industry								Effect on index of industrial production (per cent.)Changes in final expenditure	Mining and quarrying	Metals, engineering and vehicles	Textiles, leather and clotning	Food, drink and tobacco	1 a S a II -3 ?S Og (2)	d oo a a BOMS 9 a --i 03 *n H P S3 tj A2)	Gas, electricity and water	Total change	Consumers&apos; expenditure	-   5	-1- 70	4- 15	+   5	4- 25	_	4- 10	4-120	1-public authori-ties&apos; current expenditure		- 10	-   5	_:	-   5	1	i	- 20	-0-gross domestic fixed invest-ment	_	-f 70	_,	._.	4   5.	4- 20	+   5	4-100	+1-3Value of physi-cal increase in stocks and work-in-pro-gress......		4- 50	- 10		4- 15			4 55	+0-7Exports	-   5	+ 90	-	4-   5	4- 30	-	4-   5	4125	+1-7Total change in net output ...	- 10	-f-270		4- 10	4 70	4- 20	4- 20	4380	45-0Effect on index of industrial production (per cent.)  ...	-0-2	45-6	 	+0-1	4-0-9	+0-3	+0-3	4-5-0	(&apos;) The figures in this table refer to the estimated total effect of changes in expenditure, direct and indirect, on the net output (i.e., value added) of industries covered by the index ofindustrial production (viz., mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and contracting,and gas, electricity and water). The changes in net output represent the contributions madeto the change in the gross domestic product by these industries.(2) &quot; Building materials &quot; are included in &quot; Building and contracting &quot;.
them. Moreover, order books for capital equipment and in particular for machine tools lengthened during the year ; and some firms had difficultyin obtaining their requirements of steel despite substantially increased pro-duotion and imports. Developments in particular industries and in agricultureare described in the Appendix.The impact of final expenditure on imports23. One of the most marked features of the expansion in activity between1954 and 1955 was the sharp increase in imports in relation to the increasein home output. While the gross domestic product rose (in real terms)by 3J per cent., the volume of merchandise imports rose by 11^- per cent.:between 1953 and 1954 the gross domestic product went up by 4 per cent,and imports by one per cent. This relatively big increase in imports in1955 was partly due to the rapidly growing activity of the metal using industries: one-third of the total increase in imports was composed of metalsand metal materials. Nearly half of this increase consisted of imports ofsteel to make good the difference between the rate of expansion of the metalusing industries and the sate of increase of steel production. Imports ofcoal and oil rose sharply ; domestic production of coal was insufficient toprovide for increased consumption and the rebuilding of stocks. otherwise the main increase was in imports of food, drink and feedingshiffs, partly tomeet increased consumer demand and partly because in 1954 imports ofsome commodities, such as cereals, had been exceptionally low. The increasein imports of oitlher commodities appears for the most part to have beenroughly in line with increased activity of the corresponding industries. Thechart below shows the movements of imports, exports and industrial production since 1950.OUTPUT, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS( VOLUME: 1950 - (00)1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955

There was a further large increase in civil employment during theyear, though it was not quite so great as in 1954. The increase of 277,000shown in Table 10 -Was the result of 195,000 more in the working population,31,000 fewer unemployed and 51,000 fewer in the Armed Forces. As in previous years, the main increases in employment were in the manufacturing industries (178,000) and the distributive trades (58,000). Most of the increasein manufacturing employment was taken by metals, engineering and vehicles(173,000) including 46,000 in vehicle manufacture and 45,000 in the productionof electrical goods and equipment. But there were increases in all sectionsof mlanufadturing except clothing, in which there was a decline of 10,000,and textiles, where there was a decline of 39,000 (including 30,000 in cotton).Outside manufacturing many other industry groups showed increases, thenotable exceptions being agriculture and coal mining and national government service.26. Unemployment in 1955 was lower than in any year since the war ; theaverage of 232,000 was 53,000 less than in 1954 and represented one per cent,of the civilian labour force. The decline during the year was greatest in theLondon and South-Eastern Region and in Scotland, but all parts of thecountry and nearly all industries shared in the improvement. Cotton was an exception; but even in this industry, while employment fell by 30,000, thenumbers unemployed rose only by 2,000. Short time working in the manu-facturing industries was slightly higher than in 1954 but did not affect morethan one per cent, of all operatives at any time in the year. The increase was concentrated in the cotton industry where short time working rose to a peakin the summer months and then diminished. Overtime working, which had increased steadily during 1953 and 1954, levelled off during the greater partof 1955 but increased towards the end of the year, particularly in metals,engineering and vehicles. In the last week in November, 30 per cent, of the operatives in the manufacturing industries were working overtime comparedwith 28J per cent, a year before.Productivity and employment24. The increase in industrial production last year is to be explained partly by increased employment and partly by higher output per man. If the index of industrial production is compared with corresponding figures for employ-ment, as in Table 9, it appears that output per. man-year in industry roseby about 2 per cent., which is less than in either of the previous two years.Production, employment and output per man in industry

The numbers temporarily stopped are not added to theother sub-totals to obtain the working population since most, if not all, such persons are onthe pay-rolls of employers and are included in the numbers in civil employment.27. Despite the growth of over a quarter of a million in the numbers employed, the unsatisfied demand for labour continued to rise. By July, the peak month, there were 473,000 unfilled vacancies, 90,000 or 23 per cent,more than in July, 1954. In the second half of the year vacancies fell by91,000 compared with a fall of 44,000 in the second half of 1954. Neverthe-less, the number of vacancies was higher in all groups of industries at theend of 1955 than at the beginning ; the total number of vacancies was 13 percent, higher. The movements of unemployment and unfilled vacancies are shown in the chart on page 18.

There was a general rise in prices between 1954 and 1955. import prices rose by 3 per cent., export prices by 2 per cent, and the prices of goods and services sold on the home market by 4 per cent. The index of retail prices, which covers a narrower range of expenditure, rose by A\ per cent,between 1954 and 1955; details are shown in Table 11. The principalelements in the rise of retail prices were the higher costs of food, rent, fuel and services. The retail price of food was on average 1\ per cent, higher in 1955 than in 1954, although there was only a small increase on averageChanges in the Interim Index of Retail Prices between 1954 and 1955Table 11			per cent.Commodity or service	Weight in base month of the index (January 1952)	Change in price between 1954 and 1955	Effect on all items indexFood...      ......      ...... meat, bacon and fish    ...... vegetables and fruit      ......

in import prices. There were a number of reasons for this rise: therewas some improvement in the average quality and extent of service offered to the public; there were temporary shortages of some foods-of potatoesin particular ; demand in general was buoyant; and costs in distributionrose. The average prices of clothing, manufactured consumer goods, drinkand tobacco were little higher in 1955 than in 1954, but they all showedsome increase in the last months of 1955, partly on account of the higher rates of purchase tax introduced in October. The main cause of the generalrise in prices was that incomes have been rising on average about twiceas fast as real output.29. Table 12 sets out such evidence as is available on the movement of costs and prices in manufacturing industry (excluding the processing of food,drink and tobacco). Whereas in the two previous years output per man-year is estimated to have risen at the same rate as annual earnings peremployee, in 1955 output per man-year appears to have increased by only-J per cent., while earnings rose by 8 per cent. The consequence was aconsiderable rise in labour costs per unit of output. The trend of rawmaterial prices, which had been downward in the previous two years, wasreversed. The index of prices of finished manufactured goods rose by  per cent, in 1955 above the average level of 1954, which suggests that industry increased prices roughly in line with the increase in costs^ Thissupports the implication in the estimates of total profits given in Table 1that profit margins were maintained fairly constant. The experience ofparticular industries and firms no doubt differed widely from the average.The chart below shows movements in prices since the beginning of 1953.IOVEMENTS OF PRICESI20Lnoioo90Jan. 1953 - 100retail food-retail non food!&apos; manufacturingI. export5195319541955The graph of manufacturing prices is based on an index of prices of all manufactured outputother than fuel, food and tobacco.

Estimates relating to the financial position of companies are set outin Table 13. Gross profits (including stock appreciation, but before providingfor depreciation) are estimated to have risen by about  250 millions, or10 per cent., and total company income by about.  300 millions. Tax pay-ments rose by  30 millions and dividend payments by over  100 millions,leaving an increase in undistributed profits after tax of over  150 millions.31. Between 1954 and 1955 companies made substantial additions to thedrrates of capital expenditure: for the first time since 1951, the amountinvested in fixed assets and stocks was almost as large as their undistributedprofits. Their fixed investment is estimated to have risen by  165 millions and the addition to the value of stocks and work in progress by some 160 millions. The increase in the quantity of stocks was considerably greaterthan in 1954, and stock appreciation was also higher. The increased needsof companies for finance for these purposes greatly exceeded the increasein their undistributed profits. The excess was met partly by increasedborrowing and partly by reducing the amount of funds set aside for building up liquid assets and other purposes. Public companies&apos; borrowing by newissues increased by about  30 millions. It should be noted that the estimatesgiven here are totals for all companies other than financial institutions: theexperience of different firms no doubt varied widely. The main feature ofthe estimates is the continued growth in investment relative to the rise inundistributed profits, leading to a reduction in the rate of accumulation offinancial assets by companies as a whole.32. The Governiment&apos;s surplus on revenue account rose by  166 millionsbetween 1954 and 1955. The changes in revenue and expenditure leading to this result are shown in Table 14. The continuing increase of national income and expenditure raised revenue from taxation in 1955 by over  300millions. Receipts from income tax rose substantially despite the reductionin the rate of income tax in April. The yield of purchase tax rose sharplyas expenditure on motor-cars and other consumer durable goods increased.Owing to increases in the rates of contribution and benefit, the income of andexpenditure from the National Insurance Funds rose considerably. Apartfrom national insurance benefits, total government expenditure rose by 124 millions or 2\ per cent. Government expenditure on goods and servicesrose by about  40 millions, less than was needed to make up for the rise

The capital account of the Central Government is set out in Table 15.Government commodity stocks, mainly of food, were reduced further.Lending to public corporations and local authorities rose sharply; theincrease in loans to local authorities was due to their greater reliance onthe Public Works Loan Board while interest rates in the market were rising.In October the Board adopted a new procedure by which they put allapplicants for loans on enquiry as to their ability to borrow elsewhere ontheir own credit and the rates of interest were related for the future to localauthority and not Government credit. The volume of advances to localauthorities then declined. The transition from accumulating reserves offoreign exchange in 1954 to drawing them down in 1955 greatly reduced the government&apos;s need to borrow. The revenue surplus was considerably largerbut National Savings produced less. In consequence of these changes theGovernment, instead of borrowing on the market as in 1954, when its netissues of securities of all types amounted to  137 millions, was able to redeem on balance  182 millions of debt.Capital account of Central GovernmentTable 15   million	1953	1954	1955Source of finance			Surplus from revenue accountO)       ......	193	335	501Capital transfers from abroad..........	46	34	18Loan repayments by foreign governments	30	50	29Net borrowing through National Savings	-72	46	increase in fiduciary issue       .........	100	100	125New issues and sales of securities (net)(2)	633	137	-182Proceeds of iron and steel disposals	17	79	59Miscellaneous (net)      ............	34	-52	-57Total receipts ...      .........	981	729	496Investment and lending			Gross fixed investment............	207	182	188Increase in value of stocks      ......	12	-127	-107Loans to foreign government.........	4	17	33Loan repayments to foreign governments	57  -	&apos;53	50Increase in foreign reserves     .........	290	208	-231Net lending to local authorities...      ......	322	256	407Net lending to public corporations	39	99	140Coal compensation      ...      .........	50	37	16Total payments        .........	981	729	4960) Before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation.(2) Including borrowing through long and medium-term securities, Treasury Bills, TaxReserve Certificates, Ways and Means Advances, etc.]34. 1955 was a year of increasing restrictions in the field of monetary policy. Bank Rate was raised from 3 per cent, to jr. per cent, in lanuaryand from 3^ per cent, to 4J per cent, in February. Short term rates ofinterest rose sharply, medium and long term rates moderately. The pricesof ordinary shares fluctuated considerably during the year; between lanuaryand December, 1955, the average dividend yield on ordinary shares had risen by rather less than 1 per cent., or about as much as the yield on long term gilt-edged securities.
35. The higher level of interest rates in 1955 was aooompanied by acontraction in the amount of bank credit outstanding. Table 16 shows themain changes in the deposits and assets of the London clearing banks in1955. Net deposits, which had risen by about  200 millions in each ofthe two previous years, fell in 1955 by  297 millions. Clearing bank holdings of investments fell by  337 millions and their advances and other accountsfell by  46 millions. The analysis of bank advances published by the BritishBankers&apos; Association shows that over 1955 as a whole industry and agricul-ture increased their borrowing, while on balance local authorities, retailtraders and private and professional borrowers repaid bank advances. public corporations also repaid bank advances out of the proceeds of new issues of long-term debt.Deposits and assets of London clearing banksTable 16   million	Net deposits	Cash and money at call	Treasury bills	Com-mercial bills	Invest-ments	Advances and other accounts31st December, 1952 31st December, 1953 31st December, 1954 31st December, 1955	6,155 6,370 6,558 6,261	1,078 1,043 1,069 1,071	1,182 1,338 1,199 1,271	66 79 114 129	2,148 2,275 2,353 2,016	1,749 1,707 1,897 1,851Change in: Year 1953 Year 1954 Year 1955	+ 215 + 188 - 297	-   35 +   26 +    2	+ 156 - 139 +   72	+ 13 ^ 35 + 15	+ 127 +   78 - 337	- 42 -1- 190 - 461st Qtr. 1955    ... 2nd Qtr. 1955   ... 3rd Qtr. 1955   ... 4th Qtr. 1955    ...	- 420 +   34 - 64 + 153	- 117 +   14 - 18 -j- 123	- 350 +   41 + 173 -f- 208	+   2 - 10 +   8 4- 15	- 72 - 182 - 15 - 68	+ 127 + 162 - 204 - 13136. The monetary history of the year 1955 falls into two phases, coincidingroughly with the two half years. The year opened with net deposits of the clearing banks standing at the highest level recorded up to that date andwith the ratio of liquid assets to total deposits at 34-3 per cent. Pressure wasexerted on the banks&apos; liquid assets and deposits, first by the large inflowof revenue to the Exchequer in the first quarter of the year, and secondlyby the action of the monetary authorities and the attraction of privatefunds from deposit at the banks to investment in relatively high yield-ing Treasury bills and short bonds. Some contraction in net deposits andin liquid assets is normal during the first part of the year but in 1955,as a result of this pressure, the contractions were conspicuously large.The total net deposits of the clearing banks fell by  386 millions, comparedwith a fall of less than  140 millions in the first half of each of the two previous years. Liquid assets fell by  420 millions, as compared with a fall of  304 millions in the corresponding period of 1954 and of  135 millions in that of 1953.37. The clearing banks&apos; risk assets, that is, their investments and advancescombined, did not contract with the fall in their liquid assets but, on the con-trary, were expanded by  35 millions in the first half of 1955. This mainten-ance and expansion of their risk assets entailed a decline in their liquidityratios, which fell to an average of 30-0 per cent, in March and were at anaverage of 30T per cent, at the end of June. At this time, the demand forbank advances was extremely strong, despite the higher rates of interest, and action by the banks in reviewing overdraft limits was not followed until after
some months by an actual fall in advances. Until June advances continued torise rapidly : the increase during the first half of the year amounted to  289millions. This was the largest increase in advances ever to occur in a half-year : but for the change in monetary policy, it would have been larger still.The banks in large part met the pressing demand for advances by reducing their holdings of investments, which fell by  254 millions in the first half ofthe year.38. In July the Government called for a positive and significant reductionin bank advances, and in the second half of the year clearing bank advancesfell by  335 millions, or 153 per cent. About half this fall in advancesrepresented repayment by public corporations out of the proceeds of newissues, less their fresh borrowing from the banks. The reduction in otheradvances in the second half of the year came to about 8 per cent. the clearing banks also reduced their holdings of investments by a further  83millions in the second half of the year so that their risk assets, as a Whole,fell by  418 millions during this period. Their liquid assets, however,rose sharply, by  509 millions, in the second half of the year. some increase in liquid assets during the second half of the year is normal,reflecting the period of seasonal Exchequer deficit; in these six months theincrease was unusually large, partly because of greater below-the-line Budgetpayments towards local authorities&apos; capital expenditures. As a result of thereduction in risk assets and of the rise in liquid assets, the average liquidityratio of the ^clearing banks rose from 30-1 per cent, at the end of June to33-5 per cent, in September and 37-4 per cent, at the end of December.(3) OVERSEAS TRADE AND PAYMENTSImports39. The overstrain on the United Kingdom economy analysed in theprevious section had its most striking effect on our overseas position throughthe level of imports. Between 1954 and 1955 imports on a trade accountbasis expanded by 11J per cent, by volume, and 15 per cent, by value, thetotal value of imports in 1955 being  512 millions higher than in 1954. the changes in the commodity pattern of imports are shown in Table 17. Thesteep rise in imports in 1955 was chiefly concentrated upon industrial materials and fuels. Coal and iron and steel accounted for one-quarterof the total increase, and non-ferrous metals, metal ores and scrap, timber,pulp and paper and rubber between them for a further two-fifths. Importsof raw cotton declined ; the quantity of raw wool imported rose slightlybut this was offset by a fall in price.40. On the classification used in the trade accounts, the biggest increasein imports in 1955, both absolutely and proportionately, was in manufacturedgoods; but most of these were in fact semi-manufactures, such as steel andcopper, required for further processing. However, there was also a marked increase in imports of finished manufactures, especially of machinery. Importsof mineral fuels and lubricants rose by 24 per cent. Imports of food,beverages and tobacco in the first post-war year completely free of rationingrose in value by 8^ per cent, above the 1954 level, and contributed rather more than one-fifth to the total increase in imports. Half the increasein this category consisted of higher imports of cereals and feedingstuffsconsequent upon the unusually low level of such imports in 1954 and the poor harvest of that year. Imports of meat, fruit, vegetables and tobacco alsorose substantially.

The change in the commodity pattern of imports brought about achange in geographical pattern, since the extra supplies which the UnitedKingdom required were for the most part obtainable only from non-sterling countries, particularly the dollar area. As a result in 1955 imports from the dollar area increased by  223 millions or 36 per cent. ; from O.E.E.C.countries by  135 millions or 17 per cent. ; and from the rest of the non-sterling world by  78 millions or 18 per cent. The total increase in non-sterling imports was  437 millions or 23 per cent. The increase in importsfrom the rest of the sterling area was only  76 millions or 5 per cent.Exports42. Excessive demand at home also affected United Kingdom exports,although the results were perhaps less obvious than in the case of imports.On the face of it exports did very well in 1955. Details are shown in Table 18.Their value exceeded the 1954 record level by  231 millions, or about %\ percent. Part of this increase was attributable to higher export prices ; for 1955as a whole these were, on average, 2 per cent, above the 1954 level.43. The increase in volume between 1954 and 1955 was just over 7 percent. Allowance must be made for the dock strike in October, 1954, which caused some shipments to be carried over into the early months of 1955 ;taking this into account, the increase in volume was probably only about4J per cent. But our imports increased at nearly three times this rate and world conditions were generally favourable to an expansion of overseas trade.Judged in relation to the needs of the situation and the opportunities avail-able, the United Kingdom&apos;s export performance in 1955 was unsatisfactory.

Our exports did not expand as fast as those of our main competitors.In the first nine months of the year, United Kingdom exports of manufactures(which account for over four-fifths of total United Kingdom exports) were about 7 per cent, higher in value than a year previously. The corresponding increases for the U.S.A., Western Germany and Japan were about 9, 18,and 27 per cent, respectively. The United Kingdom&apos;s share of world tradein manufactures again declined slightly in 1955 ; complete figures are notyet available, but the fall appears to have been from 20J per cent, in 1954to about 20 per cent, last year.45. The biggest increases in demand for imports took place in north america and Western Europe. United Kingdom exports to the U.S.A.increased by nearly one-quarter and reached new record heights; but our exports to Canada where there was a sharp increase in imports from theU.S.A. did not expand much and failed to regain their 1953 level.   Our

Western Germany&apos;s pre-warexports were roughly two-thirds of those of the whole of Germany. The figures for 1954 and1955 are for the first nine months only.exports to Western Europe, which constitute about one-quarter of our total exports, also showed only a low rate of increase. German competition,especially in vehicles and machinery, was particularly severe in this market.Our exports to other non-sterling markets were notably buoyant; therewere substantial increases in shipments to the Middle Bast, Finland,and Spain, and this helped to bring the rate of increase in exportsto non-sterling markets as a whole up to about 10 per cent. Exports tothe sterling area increased by about 7^ per cent.; they continued to account for nearly half of all our exports, but did not keep pace either with theexpansion of sterling area imports, or with the rates of increase achieved in sterling markets by our main competitors. There was a particularly large increase in Japanese exports to the sterling area. The distribution of UnitedKingdom exports is given in Table 19.46. The increase in world demand in 1955 extended to all the mainclasses of manufactured goods except textiles; demand for metals and engineering goods was particularly strong. Our exports reflected this pattern ;but since the pattern of rising internal demand in the United Kingdom wasvery similar, they did not share to the full extent in the expansion of world trade. -

Metals and engineering products accounted for over two-thirds of theincrease in our exports. There were substantial increases, in which nearly all markets shared, in shipments of machinery and electrical goods. Thesefared better than road vehicles ; although exports of commercial vehicles and chassis increased by about one-quarter, car exports increased less thanin 1954 and there was a fall in sales of cars to North America and western europe. Exports of non-ferrous base metals rose by one-third; this was partly attributable to higher prices, especially of copper. Steel exports also increased despite the high level of home demand.48. Most of the remaining increase in export earnings was due to higherexports of chemicals, miscellaneous manufactures, food, beverages (especiallywhisky), and tobacco. Textile exports fell slightly ; shipments of cotton andsynthetics were lower than in 1954, but wool textiles showed a modestincrease.The trade balance49. For 1954 as a whole the excess of imports c.i.f. over exports andre-exports was  599 millions an average of  50 millions a month. Thetrade deficit for 1955 as a whole was  862 millions, or an average of  72millions a month. As between the two halves of 1955 there was littlefundamental change. The average deficit for the second half was a littlelower than that for the first. But, as has been noted above, the after-effects ofthe dock strike in October of 1954 were still making themselves felt in theearly months of 1955, chiefly by delaying exports into the new year; theprocess was repeated in the middle of 1955 when the June dock strike mayhave had a more marked effect in delaying exports than in delaying imports into the second half of the year. These disturbances make it difficult todetect any real trend in the figures ; and the small improvement in the figuresfor the second half year as compared with the first is of slight if anysignificance.
50. Changes in the terms of trade did not substantially affect the trade balance for 1955. Import prices rose at the end of 1954, causing a deterioration-tion in the terms of trade, but during 1955 this was partly reversed by theincrease in export prices. On average the terms of trade in 1955 were1 per cent, worse than in 1954.Current balance of payments of the United Kingdom51. The United Kingdom balance of payments on ourrent account is setout in Table 20. The deterioration in the balance of visible trade on apayments basis was less marked than on a trade account basis, as explained in the footnote to that table. On the former reckoning the adverse balanceof visible trade grew from  191 millions in 1954 to  338 millions in 1955,a worsening of  147 millions. The worsening on a trade account basis was 263 millions. One of the reasons for this difference is that part of theincrease in the landed cost of imports is composed of charges for freightand insurance, which in balance of payments statistics are reflected ininvisibles. Secondly, there is a further consequence of the dock strike inOctober, 1954. Exports are usually paid for after shipment but importsmostly on arrival; and hence some exports held up by this strike which left these shores before the end of 1954, would occur in trade accounts in1954 but in balance of payments accounts in 1955. Timing differences arealso the main reason why the balance of trade on a trade account basis was slightly better in the second half of 1955 than in the first but on a balanceof payments basis was slightly worse.52. The worsening of  147 millions in the balance of visible trade between 1954 and 1955 shown in Table 20 was accompanied by aworsening of  162 millions in the invisible balance (including defenceaid). Details are given in Table 21. Net earnings from shippingwere down by  30 millions, largely on account of the employmentof extra foreign tonnage to carry our increased imports, the attraction ofBritish tramp shipping into the United Kingdom import trade and away from foreign employment, and the rise iii tramp shipping rates. Theseare all factors more or less closely connected with the very high level ofUnited Kingdom imports. Another factor which contributed to the declinein net shipping earnings, though it is not possible to estimate its effectsprecisely, was the dock strike in May and June, 1955. The remainingworsening of  132 millions was due to the fortuitous combination of anumber of factors. It did not represent a permanent weakening in ourposition, hut rather a sudden expansion of payments which expanding receiptsmay be expected in time to overtake. Lower net oil receipts were the mainelement: these were largely due to a sharp rise in oil companies&apos; expenditurefollowing the resumption of operations in Iran and to increased payments ofroyalties and taxation to Middle East countries. -Payments of interest, profits and dividends were also higher, partly on .account of increased interest pay-ments on sterling balances (the increase in charges following the rise in shortterm interest rates during 1955 is estimated ito cost about  30 millions in afull year). There was also some increase in travel expenditure and intransfers to emigrants following the relaxation in restrictions.53. In consequence of these changes the current balance (including defenceaid) deteriorated from a surplus of  186 millions in 1954 to a deficit of  123millions in 1955. This deficit was composed of a surplus of  11 millions inthe first half of the year and a deficit of  134 millions in the second.But it seems probable that the deterioration between the two half years was not a true reflection of the trend of the balance of payments. as explained above there was a fortuitous increase in export receipts in thefirst half of 1955 on account of delays caused by the dock strike of October,1954. Also export receipts are seasonally at then lowest in the autumn and early winter and invisible payments are higher on account of the payment
of interest on the North American loans, and tourist expenditure in Europe.In addition, in the second half of 1955 special receipts from American defence expenditure reached a low point; for receipts from offshore sales, althoughrising, were not in this period sufficient to offset the fall in defence aid.When all these factors are discounted it seems probable that the real positionof the United Kingdom&apos;s current balance of payments was little if any worsein the second half of 1955 than in the first half.54.

These differences reduce the trade accounts figure of totalimports in 1954 by  313m. and increase exports by  51m., and in 1955 decrease imports by 390m. and increase exports by  58m. Secondly there are differences in the timing, and alsocertain other adjustments which cannot be separately evaluated which decrease the tradeaccount figure of imports in 1954 by  54m. and exports by  10m. and in 1955 decreaseimports by  103m. and exports by  27m. The result of all these adjustments is to decreasetotal trade account imports by  367m. and  493m. and to increase exports by  41m. and 31m. in 1954 and 1955 respectively.

The worsening in the balance of visible trade was entirely with thenon-sterling areas. Of the deterioration in invisibles,  106 millions was withthe non-sterling area and  56 millions with the overseas sterling area, so thatthe United Kingdiom&apos;s current deficit with the non-sterling world increased from  75 millions in 1954 to  336 millions in 1955. The current surpluswith the overseas sterling area was only  48 millions lower, falling from  261millions in 1954 to  213 millions in 1955.The overseas sterling area55. The general balance of payments of the overseas sterling area alteredlittle in 1955. The terms of trade remained very stable for the third year in succession and such changes as took place in the value of trade were largely due to changes in volume. But within this general price stabilitythere were considerable differences in the prices of individual commodities ;and in general the net overseas earnings of individual countries prospered or were depressed according to whether the prices of their main exports were favourable or not. Imports into almost all sterling area countries were keptat a very high level by increasing incomes and the demand of expandingdevelopment and investment programmes.56. India and Ceylon were helped by reasonably favourable tea prices,the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland by high copper prices, and malaya by strong rubber prices, and all of them remained in comfortable
surplus on their overseas trade. Australia, New Zealand and Burma were less fortunate in the prices of their exports, and the balance of payments diffi-culties which they encountered in 1954 continued inlto 1955 when all of themtook further action to restrain the level of their imports. The Middle Eaststates continued to derive an income from oil much in excess of their currentoverseas expenditure.57. In general the overseas sterling area had a slightly smaller deficitwith the rest of the world in 1955 than in 1954 (see Table 22). Their non-sterling surplus was  156 millions,  5 millions smaller than in 1954 and balance of payments of overseas sterling areaTable 22   million	1953	1954	1955 (prov.)	1954 1st half	1954 2nd half	1955 1st half	1955 2nd half (prov.)Overseas   sterling   area balance with:-Non-sterling countries (&apos;) United Kingdom	-1-284 -159	+ 161 -261	+ 156 -213	4-129 -100	+ 32 -161	+ 102 -119	4- 54 - 94	+ 125	-100	- 57	4- 29	-129	- 17	- 40United Kingdom inter-government loans and private capital and errors and omissions(2) (outflow from United Kingdom -1-)......	4-127	4-215	- 17	4- 89	4-126	4-   5	- 22Change in sterling bal-ances (increase 49   ...	4-252	+ H5	- 74	4-118	-       3	- 12	- 62O A United Kingdom estimate which includes capital transactions with non-sterling countries.(2) Complete and certain identification of all the items involved in the construction of thebalance of payments is never in practice possible, and there is therefore always some dis-crepancy between the totals of identified current and capital items. A balancing item isinserted to cover the discrepancy. It is, of course, impossible to say where in the balanceof payments the errors and omissions which have caused this discrepancy have arisen.their current deficit with the United Kingdom of  213 millions was  48millions less. Their total deficit with the rest of the world was therefore 57 millions; a much less favourable result than in either 1950 or 1953 hutbetter than in any other year since 1948.58. Despite this, however, their sterling balances fell by  74 millions in1955 as compared with a rise of  115 millions in 1954. This cannot be fully explained, but part of the reason for this was the sharp reduction of thenet capital outflow from the United Kingdom. While the United Kingdomcontinued to supply invesltment funds for long term development in the overseas sterling area, it was called upon to do so at a considerably reduced rate, partly because of the difficult conditions obtaining in the Londoncapital market. At the same time there was some reflux of short term funds from the overseas sterling area to the United Kingdom.The capita! account (non-sterling areas)59. In 1954 the sterling area had a surplus with the non-sterling world of 86 millions ; in 1955 there was a deficit of  180 millions. Practically thewhole of this worsening was in the current balance of the United Kingdom
which in 1955 was in deficit to the extent of  336 millions. The non-sterlingsurplus of the overseas sterling area was  156 millions (see Table 22), prac-tically unchanged from 1954.United Kingdom capital account with the non-sterling areaTable 23   million	1953	1954	1955	1954 1st half	1954 2nd half	1955 1st half	1955 2nd halfUnited Kingdom current balance Overseas  sterling   area surplus        ......	&quot;4. 21 -1-284	- 75 4-161	-336 + 156	4- 65 4-129	-140 4- 32	-108 4-102	-228 4- 54Sterling area balance ....	+305	4- 86	-180	4-194	-108	-   6	-174Change     in     sterling balances^) (increase, 4-) Change in E.P.U. debit balance  (increase   in debit, 4-)     ......

The change in the movement of the gold and dollar reserves between1954 and 1955 was even bigger than the worsening of the balance of the sterling area with the non-sterling world. The reserves rose by  87 millions in 1954 and fell by  229 millions in 1955. This difference is more thancovered by the change in the United kingdom&apos;s identified capital transactions which in 1955 showed a net outflow some  80 millions larger than in1954.0) The biggest part of this change occurred in the E.P.U. debit balanceand in the sterling balances. In 1954 we decreased our debt to the Unionby  78 millions but the non-sterling would added to its holdings of sterlingby nearly  50 millions. In 1955 our debit to the Union was virtuallyunchanged over the year but the sterling balances were drawn down by over 90 millions. This drawing down of sterling balances is an indication but not an exact measure of the weakening of foreign confidence in sterling and theeffects which this weakening had on the reserves in 1955,The course of exchange rates and the reserves61. There were two periods of serious weakening of confidence during1955. The first was in February when the official sterling dollar exchange rate, which had been weak since the beginning of the year, fell to $2-78f.In this month the loss of reserves amounted to  29 millions. Confidencewas restored by the corrective action taken by the Government in February,including the raising of the bank rate. The official rate improved and reached parity at the end of April.   The Exchange Equalisation Account(&apos;) The balancing item (errors and omissions) which was positive in both years was thereforesome  30 million larger in 1955 than in 1954.
authorities were authorised in February to use wider discretion in operating in markets in which sterling was traded at a discount and when this was announced the rate for transferable sterling rose to over $2-75 ; since then the discount on Che official rate has decreased to about one per cent, or less.62. The second, more serious weakening of foreign confidence in the poundstarted in July, 1955. In that month the first of the trade figures adversely affected by the dock strike appeared, and at the same time rumours abouta future depreciation of sterling started in Europe. The rate remainedbelow parity throughout the third quarter. The losses of gold and dollarsincurred in this quarter amounted to  144 millions (though, owing to thefact that deficits incurred with the European Payments Union in one monthare settled in the following month, the actual drain on the reserves in the quarter was  119 millions). Thus three quarters of the total loss of reserves in the second half year was attributable to the events of the third quarter.63. Pressures on sterling eased substantially in mid-September after a state-menit by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the annual meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund in Istanbul. The Chancellor repeated the state-roenit which he had made in the House of Commons on 26th July that thepolicy of the Government in relation&apos; to the exchange value of the poundsterling had been, and would continue to be, the maintenance of the exchangeparity of 2-80 dollars to the pound, either in existing circumstances or whensterling was convertible. He made it clear that no early move on any aspects.of the exchange front could be contemplated until the arduous process of strengthening the internal and competitive position of the United kingdom had been gone through. No decision on the timing of the convertibility of sterling or on the nature of the exchange arrangements after that date had been  taken, and all discussions and rumours about impending changes ofthe parity of, or margins for, sterling were unrealistic and irrelevant.GOLD AND DOLLAR RESERVESU.S.$ million_-_*_ U.S. $millionIl     ;   &apos; II&apos;!O     l, l^^xJ-L^qJ,. ^..........i,,,,........, ,,1 y C, %Zu JA/f,:Lzl^A.1946      1947      1948       1949      1950      1951       1952      1953      1954      1955
64. A steady improvement in the official exchange value of sterling con-tinued throughout October, assisted by commercial buying of sterling by companies in the dollar area, and the rate again reached parity early inNovember. It remained above parity without major fluctuations throughoutthe rest of the year. The reserves remained fairly steady until the payments were made in December on the North American loans.65. While short term capital movements were of considerable importanceduring 1955, and virtually all the losses of gold were incurred in the twoperiods when confidence in sterling weakened, the major part of. this lossis accounted for by the worsening of the sterling area&apos;s non-sterling balance.The chart on page 34 shows the movement of the gold and dollar reservessince the end of 1945.(4) GENERAL ASSESSMENT66. Although the world economic situation was favourable to the UnitedKingdom in 1955, the balance of payments was unsatisfactory and the gold and dollar reserves fell by over one-fifth. This external weakness was theresult of home demand rising to the point at which our productive capacitywas overstrained and imports rose more than exports. Since the forcesmaking for expansion grew too strong, Government policy was increasinglydirected to restraining the boom.67. Towards the end of 1954 the foreign trade position deteriorated andsigns of strain in the home economy appeared. In order to counter thesetendencies Bank Rate was raised to 3  per cent, at the end of January andto per cent, a month later. Action was also taken to check the growth of hire purchase sales. The purpose of these measures of credit restrictionwas to limit the growth of home demand and to bring about an improvementin the balance of payments. Confidence was restored ; the decline in reserveswas stemmed ; and the rate of exchange strengthened. The Budget in Aprilwas therefore designed to encourage production and saving by a limitedreduction of the burden of direct taxation.68. By the summer it had become evident that the pressure of demandpersisted and that monetary policy was not operating as rapidly as had been expected. Bank advances rose steeply in the second quarter. The economy was also disturbed by serious strikes. The trade balance remained heavilyadverse. There was a loss of foreign confidence in sterling, and the gold and dollar reserves began to fall again. Further measures of restraint were there-fore taken at the end of July. These comprised a request to the banks tomake a positive and significant reduction in their advances, an announcement that the capital programmes of local authorities and the nationalised industries would be pruned, and a further stiffening of the terms of hire purchase.69. The pressure of demand, however, continued at an uncomfortably high level. The labour shortage became marked; the number of vacanciesgreatly exceeded the number of unemployed. The amount of industrial building started had been rising rapidly, and it became clear thata considerable upsurge in the capital expenditure of industry was being super-imposed on the buoyant level of consumers&apos; expenditure. An increase in industrial development was desirable: but evidence accumulated that the size of the expansion in progress and in preparation was greater than our resources permitted, and was prejudicing both the stability of the homeeconomy and the required growth in exports. A check to the expansion of investment was necessary ; but it was also desirable to curb consumers&apos;expenditure, so as to make room for a healthy growth of investment and a surplus in the balance of payments.70. The Government therefore introduced in October a SupplementaryBudget, of which the chief features were an increase in the rates of purchase
tax, and in the rate of profits tax on distributed profits. The object of raisingpurchase tax was not simply to check home expenditure on the goods con-cerned but to limit consumer spending in general, so as to free resources for additional exports. Private industry was asked to moderate its rate of investment, and notice was given that the stricter credit policy would con-tinue. At the same time local authorities were asked to reduce their capitalexpenditure in 1956-57 to the level in 1954-55 and were encouraged in two ways to seek their capital needs in the market rather than from theExchequer. First, all applicants to the Public Works Loan Board were tobe put on enquiry as to their ability to borrow elsewhere on their own credit,and secondly, authorities allowed to borrow from the Board were to pay separately reflecting not Government credit, as in the past, but the credit of localauthorities of good standing in the market. Finally, adjustments were madeto the investment programmes of the nationalised industries and of the centralGovernment, and the subsidy on local authority house-building for general purposes was reduced.71. A restrictive monetary policy was pursued in 1955 in order to moderatethe boom. The nature of the policy adopted was experimental in that, apartfrom 1951-52 when conditions were different, an active credit policy had notbeen in operation for over twenty years. The course of bank advances illus-trates the resistance which the economy offers to a restrictive credit policy at atime of great prosperity, when business expectations are optimistic and manyexpansion plans are in the course of execution, but when no abnormal speculation-lative activity is taking place. Several months elapsed between the firstaction by the banks to limit borrowing and the beginning of a decline in thetotal of advances outstanding. In the second half of the year an appreciablereduction was secured, but it did not reduce the total supply of funds at thedisposal of industry and trade, including their current undistributed profits and their accumulated reserves, sufficiently to check the total rate of private capital expenditure. However, but for the credit squeeze both investment plans and consumer spending would have been on a larger scale.72. The estimates of national income and expenditure show that totalnational expenditure in real terms increased more than in 1954, while outputincreased less. The gap was filled by increased imports. The differencebetween the increase of domestic expenditure and the increase of domestic product amounted to some  110 millions at 1954 factor cost, and it contribution-buted to a significant worsening in the balance of payments on current account. The increased pressure on resources is not fully measured by this figure, since, in the field of investment, demand was not fully met either by home production or imports, and order books lengthened.73. While the basic trouble last year was the excessive level of total demand, the position was made still more difficult by the growing concen-tration of demand on the metal using industries. Consumers&apos; expenditureon cars and other durable goods increased relatively more than their totalexpenditure. Investment in plant, machinery and vehicles increased sharply ;and within the total of exports metal goods formed a larger part of the whole.Consequently great pressure was put on the imetal using industries. Theyabsorbed ,twoJthirds of the increase in civil employment and increased their output by some 10 per cent., twice as much as industry as a whole. Ina word, the structure of the economy changed in the direction of producingrelatively more metal goods, but it could not change as fast as the pattern of demand required.74. The consequence of excess demand was an abnormally large increasein the volume of imports. A considerable part of the increase consisted of coal and steel.  At the high rate of activity reached in 1955 consumption
rof these two basic materials outran domestic supplies and remaining require-ments had to be met by imports. The increase that took place in the volumeof exports in 1955 was considerable, but it fell short of the rate of increaseboth of world trade and of the volume of imports. If home demand hadbeen weaker, more goods could have been exported. The United Kingdom&apos;balance of payments on current account was in deficit in 1955 to the extentof over  100 millions. The gold and dollar reserves fell-from  986 millionsat the beginning of the year to  757 millions at the end.75. The strong pressure of demand in 1955 was associated with rising costs and prices. Import prices in 1955 were on average 3 per cent, higherthan in 1954, and money incomes at home rose by about twice as muchas the real national output. Wages and salaries rose by 8J per cent., grosstrading profits of companies and public corporations by about the same percentage, and the total national income by 6\ per cent. In consequencethe final prices of goods and services of all kinds were 3J per cent, higheron average in 1955 than in 1954. The index of retail prices was 4  percent, higher on average. An increase of 1\ per cent, in the retail priceof food took place, although import prices of food rose very little between1954 and 1955. This rise in the general price level was one of the mostdisquieting features of the economy in 1955.(5) THE PRESENT OUTLOOKThe outlook abroad76. A considerable part of the growth of world industrial output in 1955was made possible by the absorption into employment of labour and equip-ment that had been idle at the beginning of the year. By the end of 1955,unemployment had reached low levels in almost all the industrialised countries,and there are not now the same opportunities for expanding industrial outputas there were last year. Nevertheless, investment in new equipment has been taking place at such a rapid rate in many countries that continuing increases in productivity can be expected. These should lead to further rises in output,so long as demand is maintained.77. Although there are signs of weakness in the demand for the outputof one or two industries (much the most important case being the UnitedStates motorcar industry), there are few indications of any slackening in world demand for manufactured goods which would lead to a fall in output appre-ciably below full employment levels. At the same time the pressure of demand is not strong enough to cause substantial rises in the prices of theoutput of the main manufacturing countries of the world.78. It seems likely therefore that trade between the manufacturing countries will grow more slowly in 1956 than in 1955. However, the opportunities for united Kingdom exporters appear fairly favourable.79. The prospects for the trade of the world&apos;s primary producers, including those of the overseas sterling area, depend largely on the course of pricesof raw materials and foodstuffs. As long as the level of industrial activity in the world continues to expand, raw material prices on the average arelikely to remain firm. The indications are however that the primary pro-ducing countries will provide less rapidly growing markets for manufacturedgoods than in 1955 since the foreign exchange reserves of many of them have now reached low levels and will probably not be allowed to fall much further.80. The tentative conclusion therefore is that world markets for exportsof manufactured goods will expand in 1956 but more slowly than in 1955.
Prospects for the United Kingdom81. At the beginning of 1956 the United Kingdom economy was stillin an inflationary condition. Demand was pressing against the limits of productive capacity. The number of vacancies still exceeded the numberof unemployed. Costs and prices were rising, imports continued at an extra-ordinarily high level, and exports were not rising enough to produce asatisfactory balance of payments. In February the Government announcedfurther measures to restrain home demand. Some of these primarily affectcapital expenditure and some are directed at current expenditure both bythe Government and by consumers.82. The measures primarily affecting investment comprise the increase inBank Rate from 4% to 5J per cent.; the substitution of the initial for the investment&quot; allowances ; the closer scrutiny by the Capital Issues Committeeof applications to make new issues ; the extension of hire-purchase restrictions to capital goods and the reduction of programmes of public investment by over  70 mffioni: Consumers&apos; expenditure will be directly affected by thereduction of the subsidies on bread and milk, iby the further tightening ofthe terms of hire purchase, and by control of the terms on which consumer goods may be rented.83. The course of economic developments in 1956 will depend on the speed with which the disinflationary measures taken by the Governmentovercome the existing momentum of the boom. The effects of these measures will make themselves increasingly felt as the year proceeds. Itis difficult to foresee the timing of this change in the economic climate ; butif the measures so far taken ; are slow in producing results they will be reinforced.84. The main components of home demand are consumers&apos; expenditure,government expenditure and investment. Although consumers&apos; expenditureconstitutes by far the largest part of total demand, the main expansionaryforce in the economy at the present time is the increase in fixed investment in industry which gathered speed in 1955. This type of expenditure is risingmore steeply than any of the others. Large programmes of modernisation and development are in hand in most branches of industry, both private and public, and these will in time greatly improve the country&apos;s productivecapacity. But at present this growth of investment, added to a high levelof current expenditure, is imposing a strain on the economy, and is claimingtoo large a share of those types of industrial production which are most in demand in foreign markets. Higher interest rates, the stringency of credit and the reduction of programmes in the public sector will bring about achange in business expectations and a revision of plans. Nevertheless theamount of work already put in hand is so large that the rate of expenditureon fixed investment is likely to be appreciably higher in 1956 as a wholethan in 1955.85. A high rate of productive investment remains an important nationalobjective. Other demands on our resources must be restrained to make room for a higher rate of home investment and an improvement in thebalance of payments. Some fall is expected in 1956 in current expenditureon goods and services (at constant prices) by the Central Government andlocal authorities combined. The growth of consumers&apos; expenditure must also be checked : this was the purpose of the intensified restraints onhire purchase, of the reduction in food subsidies and of the higher rates of purchase tax. The aim of economic policy throughout this year will be to limit home demand, so that more of our production can be exported, and sothat the growth of imports is moderated. An easing of the pressure of demand will also contribute to the stability of costs and prices. This pro-gramme of disinflation is disagreeable but necessary: carried through withdetermination, and with the undersbanding of the country, our economy will emerge stronger and safer and we can look forward to a steady advance in the standard of living thereafter.
1APPENDIXSURVEY OF PARTICULAR INDUSTRIESFuel and power86. Consumption of all forms of fuel and power in 1955 was 250 million tonsof coal equivalent, 5 million tons higher than in 1954. There was a continuation of the trend from coal to oil, and from primary fuel to gas and electricity,both in private homes and factories.87. Deep-mined production of coal fell by nearly 3^ million tons. There were several reasons for this. There have been fewer miners, they have attended lessregularly, and the average output per man-shift (overall) has fallen. But thelargest single factor has been disputes which caused a loss of 2-7 million tons, orH million tons more than in 1954: about one million tons was lost throughone dispute alone, when Yorkshire miners struck for a fortnight in May.88. There was, however, an improvement in the rate of output in the lasttwo months of the year, so that over the year as a whole output per man-shiftat the coal face increased slightly, more coal being loaded mechanically. More-over, coal production from opencast operations was H million tons higher than in89. Altogether 222 million tons of coal were produced at home and 11 % million tons were imported ; 12 million tons were exported and 2 million tons supplied asships bunkers. As inland consumption amounted to 2151 million tons, stocks roseby 4 million tons. Detailed figures are given in Table 24.90. About three-quarters of the oil imported arrives in the crude state andis processed at United Kingdom refineries. The first phase of post-war refineryexpansion in the United Kingdom ended in 1954, and during 1955 the corn-missioning of new capacity east of Suez and the re-entry of the Abadan refineryinto world trade made it less economic to export oil from the United Kingdom.Nevertheless 6 million tons of products, worth  80 millions, were exported outof a total production of 25 million tons.91. As a result of the dry summer there was a considerable fall in the relatively small supply of energy from hydro-electric stations.92. The following table shows the extent to which the primary fuels wereconverted into coke, gas and electricity before use:  93. During 1955 the capacity of public electricity supply increased by 9 per cent.But it is estimated that at the time of maximum simultaneous demand on thesystem, potential demand was restricted by nearly a million kW through thereduction of frequency and voltages below the standard levels. During the year the Central Electricity Authority and the South of Scotland Board commissioned1,721,000 kW of new output capacity and the North of Scotland Hydro-electricBoard 127,000 kW: they incurred capital expenditure of  237 millions, of which 152 millions was for generation and transmission and  85 millions for distribution.94. To offset the rising demand for coal at power stations, the Central electricity authority have embarked upon the atomic energy programme. They also plan to be saving about 8 million tons of coal a year by 1960 by the installation of oil-burning plant.95. The gas industry has continued to concentrate production on the larger and more efficient gasworks, to link neighbouring districts with gas grids, andto close down the smaller and less efficient works. They are also making increaseduse of oil; five plants having a total capacity of 5 million cubic feet a dayare already installed and a further fourteen having a total capacity five times1954.1954 1955Million tons coal equivalentElectricityGas and coke41 4455 56
as great are being built or are on order. The Gas Boards and oil companies have been examining schemes for the supply of gas from refineries, and agree-ment has been reached on a scheme for the production of 18 million cubicfeet of gas a day from surplus oil products at the Kent refinery. The outputof both gas coke and hard coke was slightly higher in 1955 than in 1954.96. The shift in the pattern of inland consumption of primary fuels is illustrated by the following table:1954 1955Million tons coal equivalentCoal (excluding coke exported)     ...... 213 215Oil       .........      ......... 31 34Hydro-electricity       ............ 1 1245 25097. The switch to oil has been stimulated by the continuing difficulties over coaloutput. Manufacturing industry consumed slightly less coal in 1955 but increased its use of fuel oil by 20 per cent. ; it also drew 10 per cent, more electricity and per cent, more gas from public supply.Coal output, consumption and exportsTable 24 million tonsYears of 52 weeks each	1953	1954	1955Production:			deep-mined        ............	211-8	213-6	210-2opencastC)        ............	11-5	10-1	11-4Inferior coal(2)      ...      .........	0-2	0-2	0-5Imports      ...............	0-6	30	11-5Total supplies       .........	224-1	226-9	233-6Consumption:			Gas        ...      ............	27-1	27-3	27-9Electricity..............;	36-7	39-6	42-9Railways ...      ......	13-8	13-6	12-8Coke ovens.........      ...	25-9	26-6	27-iron and steel(3)......	7-1	6-7	6-engineering and other industry(3)      ...	32-4	34-1	34-2Domestic and miscellaneous(3)(4)	64-8	65-4	64-2Total inland(5)      ............	207-8	213-3	215-5Cargo exports       ......      ......	14-0	13-8	12-0Foreign bunkers    ......      ...	2-9	2-5	2-2Total use of coal    ............	224-7	229-6	229-7Stocks at end of year:			distributed        ............	17-4	15-5	18-3undistributed     ............	1-9	1-1	2-2Change in stocks during year:			distributed.........	+2-0	-1-9	4-2-8undistributed     ............	-2-6	-0-8	4-1-10) Net amount available after washing and screening.(2) Slurry recovered and disposed of from dumps, ponds, etc., in existence prior to 1947.(3) Industrial undertakings using less than 1,000 tons of coal a year are included underthe Domestic and miscellaneous item.(4) This is the balance between availability and known consumption, shipments and changesin stocks.(s) Includes changes in stocks held by consumers not making returns and changes in thetonnage of coal in transit. The increase in actual consumption in 1955 over 1954 was about1 -4 million tons.&apos;
98. Partly on account of the rail strike, the railways used nearly one million tons less coal during 1955. Consumption of motor spirit and diesel oil in roadvehicles rose by 7 per cent.99. Disposals of house coal fell by nearly one million tons, but the levelhad been exceptionally high in 1954. Moreover, domestic consumers took 11per cent, more electricity and one per cent, more gas. Their total consumptionof fuel and power (including oil) remained unchanged.100. With the co-operation of the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service andthe Regional Boards for Industry, the Government have undertaken an intensivepublicity campaign to secure the more efficient use of fuel. Government loans to finance fuel saving schemes have been taken up at an increased rate, and a totalof  If millions has now been approved. Industrial consumption of all forms of fuel and power increased by only 3 per cent, between 1954 and 1955, comparedwith the rise of 5 per cent, in industrial production.101. Gross exports, including ships&apos; bunkers, were 15 million tons of coal and coke and lOf million tons of oil in 1955. There was a marked fall in the netinvisible income from oil transactions, but this was mainly due to back paymentsentailed by new agreements with Middle East countries, which also resultedin higher royalties and tax payments on current production. United Kingdomoil companies also continued to add considerably to their investments in the restof the sterling area, financing them almost entirely from their own resources.Steel102. Steel production in 1955 reached a level of 19-79 million ingot tons, anincrease of 1-27 million tons over 1954 (Table 25). Imports rose sharply from470,000 ingot tons in 1954 to 1-86 million ingot tons in 1955, and 300,000 ingottons of reusable material became available to increase supplies to consumers.On the other hand producers&apos; stocks were built up by 380,000 ingot tons. Thetotal supply of steel in 1955 thus amounted to 21-57 million ingot tons. Of this18-22 million ingot tons went to home consumers and 3-35 million ingot tons were exported. During the year, merchants&apos; and consumers&apos; stocks increased byabout 300,000 ingot tons and the rise in consumption compared with 1954 was between 1-1 and 1-2 million ingot tons.103. Steel demand in general rose in 1955 at a rate well above that of the pre-ceding five years. Demand for steel for the manufacture of durable consumer goods, including cars, increased particularly sharply. The marked upward trend inthe use of steel sheet and tinplate, which began in 1953, continued throughout 1955.Although United Kingdom production was the highest ever achieved and pricesof imported steel were well above the home price level, imports were higher thanin any other post war year. Imports included some 450,000 tons of sheet, about half of which was for the motor industry, and 80,000 tons of tinplate. Suppliesof steel plate were almost sufficient to meet demand in the first part of 1955,although in the second half of the year demand rose further and imports increasedsharply. Duties on cold-rolled sheet of a value less than  80 a ton have been suspended until March, 1957, and on most other types of finished steel until september, 1956. Although steel production in 1956 will probably be over one million ingot tons higher than in 1955, supplies from home sources will not be adequate to meet the expected demand for sheet, plate, sections and other products.As a result, substantial imports will be necessary.104. Part of the increase in steel output came from a slight rise in the numbers employed, but output per man year also continued to increase. Considerablylarger quantities of materials were used: iron ore extraction at home exceeded16 million tons and 12-8 million tons were imported. Imports were nearly Ifmillion tons higher than in 1954, and although the necessary shipping was foundto meet this demand, freight rates moved sharply upwards and port facilities were occasionally strained. Pig iron production in 1955 was nearly 600,000 tonshigher than in the previous year. It was necessary to supplement home scrapsupplies with If million tons of imported scrap in order to meet requirements,and stocks at the end of the year were barely above the level of December, 1954.
105. In 1955 nine new batteries of coke ovens came into operation in SouthWales, Flintshire, the North East Coast, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, whilethe rebuilding of two batteries was completed in Lincolnshire and Staffordshire.Four new blast furnaces were completed, two in Flintshire, one in South wales and one in Derbyshire, while in Lincolnshire the rebuilding of two furnaces was completed. One new 200-ton steel furnace was completed in Flintshire and one60-ton furnace in Lanarkshire. A new 5-stand cold mill supplying rolled steelfor tinplate was completed at Ebbw Vale. A number of smaller schemes were also completed.   These will increase pig iron, steel and finished steel output.106. In 1956 operations should commence at new batteries of coke ovens onthe North East Coast, four new blast furnaces on the North East Coast andone in Lancashire, four new steel furnaces in South Wales, three in Flintshire,two in Lancashire and two in Sheffield : and at new mills on the North east coast, South Wales, Sheffield and Lanarkshire. A number of schemes to improve the efficiency of existing plant will also be completed. In addition development schemes are in hand which should help to relieve the pressure on sheet andtinplate supplies. In the case of sheet, new capacity is due to come into operation in the period 1956-58. New tinplate capacity at Ebbw Vale and a new con-tinuous tinplate mill at Velindre should provide additional output in the latter part of 1956.Steel supplies and materials consumedTable 25 million tons	1952	1953	1954	1955Materials				Production of pig iron and blast-				furnace ferro-alloys	10-53	11-17	11-88	12-47Consumption in steel-making of:				Pig iron............	8-49	9-31	9-77	10-43Scrap	8-93	9-77	10-29	11 09Steel supplies (ingot equivalent)				Crude steel production	16-11	17-61	18-52	19-79Imports         ............	1 -77	111	0-47	1-86Total supply of crude steelO	18-21	18-79	19-49	21-57Home supply ...	15-66	16-04	16-60	18-22Exports         ...      ...	2-55	2-75	2-89	3-35(&apos;) Includes re-usable steel and changes in producers&apos; stocks.The mete! using indnstriesC1)107. During 1955 the sharp expansion of the metal using industries which had begun about the middle of 1953, continued: total production was 9 percent, greater than in 1954. Demand for capital goods remained high and,for the first year since 1950, new orders exceeded deliveries. In the first halfof the year production of consumer goods was one-fifth higher than a yearearlier, but measures were taken to restrict demand for them and there is some evidence that in the second half of the year production was no longer increasingat the same rate. Passenger car production continued to increase but by theend of the year waiting lists for many makes of cars had disappeared. Exportsof all metal goods again increased, but part of the increase represented the postponement of shipments from 1954 to 1955, owing to the dock strike in theautumn of 1954. Defence demands were slightly lower than in 1954. Mostmetal using industries were fully occupied up to the end of the year, though there were some difficulties from shortages of steel.0) The metal using industries comprise mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding,the manufacture of vehicles and of most other types of metal goods.
JL tlm ;108. Table 26 shows estimates of the changes in supply and demand of products of these industries between 1953 and 1955. It is estimated that supplies,measured at 1954 prices, rose by  405 millions in 1955, of which some  15 millions was due to an increase in imports. Of this amount  120 millions consisted of passenger cars and consumer goods for the home market,  110 millions went intoincreased exports and  100 millions was absorbed by increased investment inplant machinery and vehicles (other than cars). Production for defence was slightly lower in 1955 than in 1954.Distribution of supplies of metal goodsi1)Table 26   million at 1954 factory prices	1953	1954	1955Supplies			Production        ...............	3,825	4,200	4,590Imports   ..................	105	90	105	3,930	4,290	4,695Demand			Defence production^)   .........	610	615	600Investment (excluding cars)     .........	1,140	1,185	1,285Passenger cars for the home market   ...	145	200	270Consumer goods for the home market	295	340	390Other industrial goods, repair work, and stock			change(3)        ...............	620	780	870Exports    ..................	1,120	1,170	1,280	3,930	4,290	4,695(&apos;) Products of industries in Orders VI to IX of the Standard Industrial Classification andiron foundries.(2) Including defence research and development work and goods purchased by the UnitedStates (&quot; offshore purchases &quot;) for delivery to United Kingdom forces.(3) This includes components, consumable tools, etc., supplied to other industries.Production and exports of engineering products and metal manufacturesTable 27		1953	1954	1955(0Production in the metal using industries ...	1948 = 100	126	138	151Volume of exports of engineering products				and metal manufactures	1954 = 100	96	100	109Merchant ships completed:				Total......      .........	thousand	1,223	1,493	1,282For overseas owners.........	gross tons	390	529	570Metal-working machine tools:				Deliveries.........	  millions	66-2	65-6	75-0Exports (new, complete)      ......	  millions	21-1	18-5	18-8Domestic radio and television sets:				Production	thousands	2,332	3,170	3,761Exports	) j	327	320	358Passenger cars and chassis:				Production		595	769	898Exports         ......		302	366	373Commercial vehicles and chassis:				Production	))	239	269	340Exports         ............	*)	110	126	157(&apos;) Export figures for 1955 include some exports postponed from 1954 owing to the 1954dock strike.
109. Some details of production and exports in the metal using industries aregiven in Table 27. Nearly one-sixth more cars were produced in 1955 thanin 1954, and there was a comparable increase in production of other metalconsumer goods, but there was also an increase of some 5 per cent, in productionof plant and machinery, compared with 3 per cent, in the previous year; thecapital goods industries are not, on the whole, mass production industries, andspectacular increases such as those in consumer goods cannot be expected.Towards the end of the year, there was some diminution in the rate of increasein production of consumer goods, due probably to the restrictions on hire purchasefinance imposed during the year and the increase in purchase tax. Production ofcapital goods continued to increase up to the end of the year. Both demand for,and production of, metal-working machine tools, increased by particularly largeproportions: the volume of production was 10 per cent, more than in 1954,but even so orders on hand at the end of the year had increased by more thanone-fifth, or about three months&apos; production.110. The output of merchant shipping from shipyards in the United kingdom in terms of launchings rose in 1955 to T4 million gross tons, the highest figuresince the war, compared with 1-3 million gross tons in 1954 ; but output in termsof tonnage completed fell by about 200,000 gross tons from the post-war record of 1-5 million gross tons achieved in 1954. The proportion of completions for overseas owners in 1955 was 44 per cent. (570,000 gross tons) compared with 35per cent. (529,000 gross tons) in the previous year.111. The revival of orders for new tonnage which occurred in the autumn of1954 continued throughout 1955: the volume of new orders booked during theyear slightly exceeded the tonnage ordered over the whole of the previous threeyears 1952-1954. Moreover, for the year as a whole the tanker tonnage orderedwas only slightly in excess of the non-tanker tonnage ordered, so that a reason-ably balanced order book was preserved. The total order book rose from about four and a quarter million gross tons at the end of 1954 to over five and a quarter million gross tons at the end of 1955, which, having regard to the numberof orders on which work has already started, represent something like threeyears&apos; work for the industry as a whole at the current rate of output. Theoutlook is, therefore, encouraging, provided that the shipbuilders can obtain the steel they need to maintain and improve their output.112. Employment in the metal using industries increased further during 1955by 155,000 or 4 per cent., to over 4 million ; this compared with a total increase for all manufacturing industries of 178,000 or 2 per cent. Despite this increase in employment there has been a shortage of labour, particularly of skilled craftsmen and technicians. Unemployment fell again, to about 22,000or 0-6 per cent., compared with 28,000 at the end of 1954. The number ofunfilled vacancies notified, after some fluctuation during the year, was higher in December than at the end of 1954.113. The actual increase above the previous year in the volume of exports of products of the metal using industries was about 9 per cent., compared witha rise of about 4 per cent, in 1954. The 1955 figures however include, andthe 1954 figures exclude, exports which were postponed from 1954 to 1955 owingto the dock strike in the autumn of 1954. Apart from this the increase maynot have been much greater than in the previous year.114. At the end of 1955 there were ample orders on hand for most types ofcapital goods, and production of consumer goods was continuing to run at ahigh level, although the rate of increase appeared to be falling off a little. Therewere substantial increases during the year in wage rates and prices of rawmaterials and fuel, and these were partly reflected in the prices of the industries&apos;products, the average level of which rose throughout the year, after showing verylittle increase during the previous three years. Shortages of steel, which appearedduring the year, were responsible for some restrictions of activity and, more frequently, lack of special shapes and sizes led to the accumulation of work inprogress. The necessity of importing higher-priced steel from abroad to supple-ment home supplies also increased costs.
Building115. With the removal of controls late in 1954 building owners were free fromthe beginning of 1955, for the first time since the beginning of the war, to putin hand such work as the building and civil engineering industry was willingto undertake. This resulted in an increase in the load of work on the industry,and in parts of the country at least, the available labour force was inadequate.The industry was further handicapped by exceptionally bad building weather in the early months of the year. However output recovered in the later months,and for the year as a whole net output was 2 per cent, higher than in 1954.Despite competition from other industries the building industry, once the weatherhad improved, increased its labour force to a record post war level, and main-tained a higher level of employment well into the autumn. On average, employ-ment in 1955 was about 2 per cent, above that in 1954.116. Substantial changes occurred in the local authority housing programme during 1955, and the amount of work completed fell by about  75 millionscompared with the 1954 figure. This fall was only partly offset by the increasein work on houses for private owners, so that the total amount of housingwork done was lower than in 1954. The total number of houses completeddropped from 354,000 in 1954 to 324,000 in 1955.117. As was expected, the volume of industrial building work in 1955 showed a marked increase, and there was a further substantial rise in the work doneon commercial premises: these two items between them accounted for about an extra  30 millions. The amount of work started on schools rose as a resultof the enlarged programme of major and minor works.118. Apart from steel, supplies of building materials were satisfactory. Brickproduction was about steady at the 1954 level and was adequate mainly becauseof the reduced demand from the housing programme. Cement production roseby over half a million tons. Over 50,000 tons more steel reinforcing rods were used by the industry than in 1954, but despite these increased supplies, shortageswere reported.119. Building costs, which had remained reasonably steady over the previous year, rose in 1955 by about 4 per cent. The price of many building materialsincreased during the year and higher wages were agreed.120. The prospects are that output in 1956 will be still higher. The amountof industrial development started in 1955 was about one third more than in1954 and most of this additional work can be expected to make good progressin 1956 as site labour forces have by now been built up. The amount of housing work in progress at the beginning of 1956 was substantial despite thereduction of starts in 1955. Starts in 1956 are somewhat uncertain but it isthought that, with slum clearance programmes gaining impetus, the total amountof housing in 1956 should be only slightly less than that in 1955.121. Civil engineering work should show a further increase in 1956. Apartfrom the factory building which the industry will be called upon to undertake,the amount of work on the new road programme should be about twice as large this year as in 1955.Textiles and clothing122. The production of textiles was about 2 per cent, lower last year than in1954, largely as a result of the reduced activity of the cotton industry throughoutthe year. Output of clothing on the other hand reached a post-war peak, about  per cent, higher than in 1954. The wool industry maintained the high level of activity to which it had recovered in 1953 and 1954, and the production of con-tinuous filament rayon yarn and staple fibre continued to increase with greaterexport demand, reaching record levels about 5 per cent, higher than in 1954.123. The production of cotton and rayon cloth, however, was affected by the continuing decline in exports, and the long term expectation of lower raw cotton prices, due largely to mounting surpluses in the U.S.A., encouraged hand-to-
mouth buying and reduction of stocks. Increased competition from importedcloth was also felt in the home market. As shown in Table 28, productionof cotton yarns was over 11 per cent, lower, and that of spun rayon yarnsabout 15 per cent, lower, than in 1954. Production of woven cotton and rayoncloth was about 11 per cent, lower and indeed fell back below the 1953 level. Pro-duction for industrial uses continued high and the main weight of the decline wasin fabrics for clothing.Textile production and exportsTable 28 million	1951	1952	1953	1954	1955Production					Rayon (and other man-made fibres):					Staple fibre (lbs.)	167	127	202	228	239Continuous filament yarn (lbs.)	217	156	217	220	233Single yarn spun in cotton industry:					Cotton and cotton waste yarn (lbs.) ...	968	673	777	841	747Spun rayon and mixture yarns (lbs.) ...	109	98	157	155	132Woven cotton cloth (linear yards)	2,202	1,691	1,829	1,994	1,781Woven rayon and mixture cloth (linear					yards)     ...............	759	601	754	781	698Wool and hair tops (lbs.).........	241	231	323	304	309Woollen and worsted yarn (lbs.)......	501	455	535	539	539Woven wool cloth, excluding blankets					(sq. yds.)...............	418	378	412	414	410Exports					Rayon (and other man-made fibres):					Staple fibre (lbs.)        ...      ......	14	22	19	24	55Continuous filament yarn (lbs.)	23	18	27	28	27Cotton yarn and thread (lbs.)   ......	80	45	52	52	47Spun rayon and mixture yarns (lbs.)	5	3	-   5	4	4Woven cotton piece-goods (linear yards)	858	715	707	631	534Woven rayon and mixture cloth (sq. yds.)	218	152	177	175	134Wool and hair tops (lbs.).........	49	54	70	67	77Woollen and worsted yarn (lbs.) ...	27	25	29 .	25	26Woven   wool   piece-goods,   excluding					blankets and carpets (sq. yds.)	109	98	105	98	108124. The total labour force employed in textiles and clothing (excluding foot-wear) fell by some 40,000 during 1955, largely within the cotton industry, andat the end of the year was about 100,000 lower than the post-war peak reached in 1951. A number of cotton mills closed during the year but, with the sparecapacity existing in the industry, and a strong demand for labour elsewhere,alternative employment was in general available for displaced workers.125. In contrast to the marked decline in exports in 1955, consumers&apos; expendi-ture on clothing in the home market continued its uninterrupted rise since 1952and was about A\ per cent, higher than in 1954 (measured at 1948 prices).Retailers&apos; stocks of textiles and clothing appear to have been a little higher than in1954 ; wholesalers&apos; stocks tended to fall.126. Exports of wool tops and piece goods more than recovered from their fallin 1954, and reduced deliveries of rayon continuous filament yarn and staple fibreto the home spinning and weaving industry were fully compensated for by a record level of exports. Exports of cotton and rayon textiles, however, lostfurther ground before increased foreign competition and market restrictions.The volume of exports of cotton yarn and thread fell by 10 per cent., of cotton piece goods by 15 per cent, and of rayon and mixture cloth by 23 per cent.127. The volume of imports of woven cotton piece goods last year was about12 per cent, greater than in 1954, although they tended to decline during the year
from the peak reached at the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955. Importsfrom India in particular fell markedly towards the end of the year. Of these totalimports about 90 per cent, consisted of grey cloth of which it is estimated that about one-half was for re-export after processing.128. Raw cotton prices were in general some 12 per cent, lower in December,1955, than in December, 1954, and were under the shadow of American surplusstocks throughout the year. The uncertainties of the position and the general expectation of lower prices led to a constantly falling level of raw cotton stocks in the United Kingdom to a new low level at the end of the year a fall ofabout one-third during the year and about one-half over the past two years.Prices of raw wool were fairly stable during the first half of 1955 at a level about per cent, lower than the average for 1954. However, there was a further declinein the late summer and although prices became a little firmer towards the end ofthe year they remained about 10 per cent, lower than in the first half of the year.No significant change in stocks of raw wool took place. Average wholesaleand retail prices of clothing maintained the stability shown in 1954. wholesale prices were a little lower on average than in 1954, retail prices remaining virtuallyunchanged. But both retail and wholesale prices were rising slightly towards theend of the year.129. Towards the end of the year the order book position of the cotton industryimproved, and as a result, short-time working declined. The extent of the recoveryhowever, and the level of output in 1956, will continue to be influenced by theindustry&apos;s export prospects, which show few signs of improvement. The woolindustry should, if a high level of industrial activity in North America continues,at least maintain its important exports to those markets.Agriculture130. Weather conditions for agriculture were much more favourable in 1955than in 1954. The abundant sunshine and absence of rain made the harvestparticularly early and easy. Owing to the combined effect of the weather, the substantial elimination of rabbits by myxomatosis and various technical improve-ments in crop husbandry, cereal yields per acre were higher than have ever been recorded before ; and although the cereal area in 1955 was acresless than in 1954, the total volume of production was greater. The hay harvestwas also very satisfactory. On the other hand the dry conditions were unfavour-able to root crops and horticultural products, and in particular the potato crop.The main crop of potatoes had to be supplemented by imports. The output of most kinds of livestock products continued to increase slowly. In comparingbeef output in 1954 and 1955, it must be remembered -that there was a substantialnon-reourring element in the 1954 output due to the decline in average age of slaughter following decontrol. The downward trend of pig-meat production was an exception and the output forecast for 1955-56 is materially lower than the peak figure recorded in 1954-55.131. Despite a lower output of pig-meat, potatoes and vegetables, the index ofagricultural net output in 1955-56 is forecast at a rather higher level tihan1954-55 (Table 29), owing largely to record yields per acre of cereal crops, abetter hay crop and some increase, in the production of milk and eggs.132. The lower output of pig-meat has, no doubt, been accompanied by somecorresponding reduction in farmers&apos; usage of feedingstuffs. This, together withthe favourable cereal harvest, is expected to result in a smaller volume offeedingstuffs imports in 1955-56 than in 1954-55. There still remains, however,considerable scope for greater efficiency and economy in the use of feedingstuffs,including the improved production and utilisation of grass.133. These aspects of grass and livestock husbandry continue to receive theattention of the Agricultural Departments&apos; research and advisory services. Inparticular, better and cheaper ways of making and conserving silage are con-tinuously being sought.   A further development in advisory work has been the
increasing emphasis placed on better farm management. The advisory services have equipped themselves to give farmers more systematic advice on this subject,and there is a keen demand for this from the more progressive farmers.Agricultural production in the United kingdom table 29 years beginning June	1947-48	1953-54	1954-55	1955-56Crop acreage (thousands)				Wheat and rye.........	2,198	2,285	2,500	1,968Other grains	5,866	5,870	5,253	5,340Potatoes......	1,330	985	945	874Sugar beet	395	415	437	424All tillage         .........	12,880	12,304	11,832	11,302Crop production (thousand tons)				Wheat and rye.........	1,689	2,730	2,822	2,619Other grains      .........	4,514	6,187	5,239	6,152Potatoes......      ......	7,766	8,260	7,325	6,145Sugar beet        .........	2,960	5,275	4,521	4,512Livestock production				Milk (million gallons)   ......	1,704	2,170	2,151	2,184Eggs C) (&apos;000 tons)      ......	338	525	552	574Beef and veal    ......	478	637	777	705Mutton and lamb        ......	112	176	186	186Pig-meat 0)      .........	177	606	745	649Net agricultural output (&apos;)				(1936-39 ^ 100)	124	155	150	154Agricultural holdings only (z)	128	155	.151	155(&apos;) Includes production of eggs, pig-meat and other output from gardens, allotments, pigclubs and other small producers.(2) Holdings of one acre and above (or over i acre in Northern Ireland).

Beginning with the 1955season a new Potato Marketing Scheme came into force, and the guarantee willbe implemented by a support price operated by the Potato Marketing Board.In fact very few potatoes have had to be bought at support prices, since thesmall crop has kept market prices above this level.135. On the production side the main objective is to expand production so faras this can be done economically and efficiently, e.g. by more beef productionand by making greater use of home grown rather than imported feeddngstuffs.In all branches of agriculture it will continue to be important to promote every possible advance in technique and management, including the fullest exploitation of the naitdon&apos;s grasslands.(31780) Wt. 1525-1165   161, 121, 101   3/56  d.l.
