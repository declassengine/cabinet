THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJTESTY5S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 4 8CP. (56) 602nd March, 1956CABINETVOLTA RIVER ALUMINIUM scheme memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn November 1952 the Cabinet, after considering a memorandum on the VoltaRiver aluminium scheme (C. (52) 402), approved the early appointment of aPreparatory Commission to complete an investigation of the scheme, and authorised the presentation of a White Paper on it (C.C. (52) 99th Conclusions,Minute 4). The White Paper was subsequently issued as Cmd. 8702.2. The Preparatory Commission has virtually completed its work; and fromits findings the scheme can be judged to be economically and technically sound.It has been contemplated that during the first two weeks in April the permanent secretary of the Board of Trade should preside over meetings in London between representatives of the United Kingdom and Gold Coast Governments, and of the aluminium Company of Canada and the British Aluminium Company. these discussions were intended, in effect, to resume negotiations at the point at whichthey were left before the publication of the White Paper; and to take account ofthe findings of the Preparatory Commission. We are, therefore, very close to thetime when crucial decisions will have to be taken. Is the scheme to go ahead?If so, to what extent, if at all, are Her Majesty^ Government to be committed tocontribute to its very heavy capital requirements? Any doubts about her majesty&apos;s Government^ participation, or about the scale and timing of thatparticipation, must, I feel sure, be resolved without avoidable delay, and certainlyin good time to allow them to be discussed with the Gold Coast Government andthe aluminium companies before discussions begin in April. It is with this in mind that I now bring the matter before my colleagues.3. The Volta River aluminium scheme is a project of great magnitude and complexity for building a dam and power station in the Gold Coast to supplypower for a smelter, which would produce aluminium from the bauxite depositsin the colony. The White Paper envisaged that the financing of the hydro-electricproject would be a joint responsibility of the United Kingdom and Gold CoastGovernments; that the two Governments and the aluminium companies wouldfinance the smelter; and that the Gold Coast Government would be solely responsible for the port, rail, road and other public works.4. The impetus behind the scheme arose largely from anxieties about (i) theready availability of adequate supplies of aluminium, an anxiety which was increased by the shortages experienced at the time of the Korean war; and (ii) theheavy dependence of the United Kingdom on Canada, which supplies some 90 percent, of the sterling area&apos;s requirements at a current cost of over $110 millions ayear. Apart from Volta, there is no prospect of any significant production of the metal in the sterling area. Estimates of supply and demand are necessarilyspeculative, but it would seem that in 1965 (the earliest date by which the Voltascheme could produce metal) there should be adequate supplies of aluminium tomeet our requirements without the scheme. Subsequently, however, demand mightwell outstrip available supplies unless additional capacity for producing metal were established. This could not be done at short notice it is doubtful whether a new49653
aluminium smelter of any size can be built and come into production in much lessthan three years, and the period is longer where a hydro-electric installation hasto be built.5. It has always been contemplated that Aluminium Limited (of Canada)would take the major equity risk in the Volta scheme, and if they are still of thismind I think we can be satisfied that metal produced in the Gold Coast would becompetitive in cost and would find a ready market. (Indeed their attitude wouldin any event be a crucial factor in any consideration of the scheme.) Further, I amfar from certain that, failing some new source of supply, British industry may not find itself hampered, if not embarrassed, in the years from 1965 onwards by ashortage of aluminium, of which we must have adequate supplies if we are to meetthe growing demands of the world for plant, machinery, and everything thatrequires metal. But, however desirable the Volta scheme may be, I am greatlytroubled at the prospective financial burden.  The table below shows (a) the pattern of investment which was contemplated in the White Paper;(b) how much, on the basis of that pattern, each of the parties would have toprovide to meet the current estimates; and(c) how much each party would have to contribute were the current estimates of cost increased by 45 per cent. (Whether the final costs would in fact be greater by some 45 per cent, than the current costs (which are atSeptember 1955 prices with a contingency allowance of 15 per cent.) isa matter of speculation, but we must have regard to this figure sincethe Preparatory Commission in their report say that &quot; an allowance ofthe order of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, above present estimates wouldnot be out of line with general experience.&quot; It is, however, fair to add that the aluminium companies are doubtful about the need to providefor an increase of this magnitude.)Estimates of Cost(120,000-ton capacity*)	id)	(b)	ic)	 m.	 m.	 m.United Kingdom Government	52	72	107Gold Coast Government	37	75	84Aluminium companies	25	38	55Total.........	...     114	185	246* These estimates are on the basis of an annual production of 120,000 tons of aluminium. TheWhite Paper and the Preparatory Commission^ reports also give estimates for an annual productionof 80,000 tons and 210,000 tons. It might well take some time to work up to 120,000 tons, butfor present purposes I think it prudent to work on that figure. We need not deal here with the210,000 tons, which stage could be deferred indefinitely, but it should be noted that the bulkof the additional necessary expenditure would be in respect of the smelter.6.   The burden on the United Kingdom implicit in these figures consists of:  (i) direct loans from the United Kingdom Government amounting to 72 millions and rising possibly to  107 millions or more if the need forthe 40-50 per cent, allowance suggested by the Preparatory Commissionproved to be well founded;(ii) the bulk of the  75 millions (rising possibly to  84 millions or more) whichthe Gold Coast Government would provide by drawing on their sterling balances: it can be assumed, however, that they would draw ontheir sterling balances even if the scheme were not put in hand; and(iii) at least half the money to be provided by the aluminium companies this because it was agreed in 1952 that the Canadian company, AluminiumLimited, would be allowed to raise up to 50 per cent, of the capital itneeded for the scheme on the London market. (To the extent that,contrary to present expectations, the British Aluminium Companyparticipated, the London market would have to provide more than this50 per cent.)The expenditure would be spread over some eight years, but the 1952 discussionscontemplated that repayment of the United Kingdom loans to the power project
(i.e.,  56 millions or  84 millions respectively out of the  72 millions or  107 millionsmentioned at (i) above) would be spread over eighty years from when productionbegan although this period could and should I feel sure be shortened as andwhen the Gold Coast Government became able to re-finance the debt on the powerproject. There was no definite understanding about the duration of the UnitedKingdom loans to the smelter (i.e., the balance of  72 millions or  107 millions at(i) above).7. I have the deepest misgivings about our embarking on capital commitments of this order. The commercial return so far as the United Kingdom is concerned would be that the aluminium smelter company would be under an obligation forthirty years after initial production, say in 1965, to offer buyers in the UnitedKingdom not less than 75 per cent, of the metal produced, at a price which, in normal circumstances, would not compare unfavourably with North Americanprices. That is to say, we would be able to count on a minimum of 90,000 tons of aluminium a year when output reached 120,000 tons. This would save the UnitedKingdom some $42 millions a year; and it might be argued that the whole outputof 120,000 tons $56 millions would be a direct relief to the sterling area&apos;s balanceof payments so long as the Gold Coast remained a member of the sterling area.This is far from unattractive but on the other hand, a very much smaller UnitedKingdom investment in Canada would almost certainly secure the additionalaluminium that we shall want from 1965 onwards.8. If we were to look at this scheme solely from the economic standpointI should be inclined to advise my colleagues that even though the estimates showed that aluminium could be produced on an economic basis, we should not be justifiedin present circumstances in proceeding with it since, given the magnitude of our existing external commitments I should regard the sums involved as a quitedisproportionate insurance against a possible shortage of aluminium in the UnitedKingdom. On the other hand, there is no doubt that an abrupt withdrawal by theUnited Kingdom at this stage would cause a major breach of relations between thiscountry and future Gold Coast Governments, which would probably turn elsewherefor assistance to bring about the Volta scheme. It is not too much to say that adecision to withdraw Her Majesty&apos;s Government would adversely affect our influence on, and relations with, West Africa for years to come. Therefore we must do our best to see that the scheme goes forward, but this must be on the basis of substantial support from outside, e.g., from the World Bank.9. In these circumstances I recommend that the Gold Coast Government andthe aluminium companies should be told forthwith :  (a) that the United Kingdom Government remain ready to participate in thescheme;(b) that the United Kingdom Government think the pattern of investmentcontemplated in 1952 will need to be reconsidered in view not only ofthe substantial increases in costs disclosed in the PreparatoryCommission^ reports, but also in view of the United Kingdom&apos;s many other commitments and serious economic situation;(c) that the United Kingdom Government think that the scheme can only go forward with their participation if there is an assurance of substantialfinancial support from outside the sterling area;(d) that the United Kingdom Government accordingly suggest that an earlyapproach should be made to the World Bank and that the April talksshould (apart from technical matters) be concentrated on (i) an exchangeof views about the situation brought about by the substantial increase inthe estimated costs and (ii) consideration of the implications of thepossible participation by the World Bank. It would be understood thatthe time-table originally contemplated would have to be reconsideredin the light of the need to recast the pattern of investment.10. Officials of the Departments concerned have had informal discussions withthe Governor of the Gold Coast who thinks that such an approach would not beill-received by his Government. He has stressed that it is desirable that there shouldbe talks in April, since if there were no such discussions Gold Coast Ministers might
think they were being let down. He has also said he thinks the Gold coast government would expect the United Kingdom Government to find not less thanthe sum originally contemplated in the White Paper.11. If my colleagues agree with the course I have proposed they will no doubtinvite the Colonial Secretary to communicate accordingly with the Gold coast government. I would simultaneously make a similar communication to the aluminium companies.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,29th February, 1956.
