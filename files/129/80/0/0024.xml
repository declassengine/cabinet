(THIS&apos;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS government secret.P0(56) 74IOth March, 1956.BRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWhen the Cabinet considered the financial position of theBritish Transport Commission on 6th March they asked that the economic policy Committee should give further consideration to the issues involvedin postponing any increase in railway charges for six months.     (Ce,M0(56)19th Conclusions, Minute 8).     The Economic Policy Committee have nowdone so.20 It was common ground amongst all members of the Committeethat we must avoid a policy of freezing price levels and of subsidiesfrom public funds.     There should, therefore, be no question of associating the coal industry with any delay in raising railway charges.Some further increase in the latter charges was inevitable and theCommittee thought that the increases in passenger fares already authorisedor which would not involve application to the Transport Tribunal, mightwell be made forthwith in order to bring home the effect of the recent wage increases for transport workers.     The practical question was whether itwould be worth deferring in whole or in part the large increase in freight charges proposed by the Commission, in the hope that in the new atmospherin relations betv/een management and men this might act as a real spurto the achievement of economies which would go some way to pay for theincreased wage costs and which should have a great effect on the industry&apos;smorale.     The Committee recognised that a period of six months wouldbe too short to show any major results, though a start could be made withthe reduction of unremunerative services.    What might be achieved inthis time, in a favourable psychological situation, would be the agreementof plans with the unions which would bear fruit in the future.     It must beremembered that we are proposing to spend in the next ten to fifteen yearssomething of the order of  1, 200 millions on the capital re-equipment ofour railway system.     The attitude of mind with which the industry goesinto this adventure is of cardinal importance.3. The Committee considered two ways in which it seemed tothem that this objective could be approached:(a)   to allow the Commission to make the increase in passenger fares referred to in paragraph 2, but to ask them to postponefor a period of six months their proposals for certain otherfare increases (on season tickets and early morning faresinvolving an annual yield of  l  millions) and for freight charges, and to make an exceptional effort during thisperiod to see how much of the balance could be made good by the industry s own efforts;COPY NO.   5 3CABINET
(b)   to allow the Commassion to make the fare increasesalready mentioned but to ask them to cut down their proposals for freight charges by one-half and at thesame time to postpone the increases for season tickets, etc.     This arrangement too would be subjectto review after six months.4. These proposals are set out in detail in the Appendixwhich contains an estimate of their yield over a full year.     It will beseen that there is a substantial difference between the yield of the first( 7. 7 millions) and the second alternative ( 24.3 millions), but that the gap between the revenue obtained from the second and the  37 millionsoriginally budgeted for by the Commission is not so large.5. The Economic Policy Committee recognised that to agree tothe full increases (at the rate of  3 7 millions a year) would be in accord-ance with the general policies with which the Government are trying to face the economic difficulties of the time.    It must, therefore, beadmitted that either 3(a) or 3(b) have something of the character of back-sliding from orthodoxy.    Nevertheless, for the reason which I have setout earlier, the Committee as a whole approved this lapse.    I think thatit would also be a fair summary of their opinion to say that they felt it wiser to adopt proposal (b) because, although a transgression, itwould, like the housemaid&apos;s baby, still be quite a small one.    they thought this worth while in order to take advantage of what appeared tobe tire beginning of a new attitude of the railway unions towards their responsibilities.    They also took account of the point that this decisionof the Government might to some extent be justified by the fact that a completely new system of freight charges is on the way.H.M.Treasury Ch \xnbers, S0W.l.10th March, 1956.
