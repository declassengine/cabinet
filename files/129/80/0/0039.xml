I. i. ii&apos; p(this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET\ rC.P.(56) 89 COPY NO,23rd March, 1956.CABINETTHE S OM A LI LAND PROTECTORATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesRecent events have made it necessary to reconsider our policy in the Somaliland Protectorate, and I have therefore preparedthis memorandum in consultation with the Foreign Secretary.2. Somalis in the Protectorate .have been bitterly disappointedand their confidence in British rule badly shaken by the Anglo-EthiopianAgreement of November 1954 which provided for the withdrawal of british military Administration from those areas of Ethiopia (known as the Haudand Reserved Area) which border the Somaliland Protectorate and arevitally necessary to the grazing economy of the Protectorate tribes.Political activity in the Protectorate has increased greatly as the resultboth of the Haud Agreement, and of the approaching grant of independence to the neighbouring Trust Territory of Somalia in I960, (which it is nowthought might happen earlier).    Somali leaders are now seeking astatement defining our policy on:-(a) the grant of independence to the Protectorate;(b) the closer association of the Protectoratewith Somalia.3. One consideration affecting the problem is that the Somalitribes in effect form a single ethnic &quot;nation&quot; which, by historical accident,has been divided between the Somaliland Protectorate (British), FrenchSomaliland, Somalia under Italian Trusteeship, the Ethiopian Ogaden and&quot;Reserved Areas&apos; and parts of the Northern Province of Kenya.4. In deciding on future policy in the Somaliland Protectoratethe following factors must be taken into account:-(i)       The Protectorate is a poor country and, unless oil isdiscovered, is likely to be a financial liability forany administering Power.(ii)      Recent events in the Middle East and, in particular,the entry of Russia on the scene and the subversive activities of the Egyptians, the Saudi Arabians andthe Yemenis, have sharpened the strategic necessity to deny the Protectorate to any potential enemy.The Chiefs of Staff consider it essential forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to retain certain minimumstrategic rights which should be embodied in a formaltreaty, as an essential pre-requisite of granting self-government to the Protectorate.
Inter-tribal feuds caused by the shortage of water and grazing lands are traditional and inter-tribalfighting   frequently occurs in the Protectorate.It is not likely that the pressure on grazing landscan be eased, for the country suffers severely fromover-grazing and the scope for settled agriculture is limited.There is no single Somali authority in the protectorate and any purely Somali body capable of governing the Country would have to be bt ilt up by politicalprocesses.    This will take some time as thepolitical development of the Protectorate isrudimentary.Somalia under Italian trusteeship is by a resolution ofthe United Nations due to become independent in I960,and all the indications are that independence will begranted whether Somalia is ready for it or not.As the first independent Somali state, Somalia willbe the focus of Somali aspirations and there is certain to be very strong pressure for closer association, if not union, between Somalia and the somali land Protectorate.Although tribal rivalries exist both in the protectorate and Somalia there is a broad division between thetwo groups of tribes known as the Isaak and the Darod.The Darod tribes inhabit Somalia and spread into the protectorate.    They tend to look to the Somali YouthLeague which has its headquarters in Mogadishu for political leadership.     The remaining Somalis of the protectorate are mainly Isaak,     They tend to supportthe moderate Somali National League which has its headquarters in Hargeisa, and to identify themselves with the British connection.    Within the last year bothSocieties have lent support to the National United Front,a new society with the aim of uniting all Somalis in the protectorate to secure the return of the Haud and reserved Area.While desiring union and independence, Somalis ofthe Protectorate recognise that some friendly power will be needed to guide and sponsor an independentSomali State and despite their recent disappointmentsthey would probably still prefer to see the UnitedKingdom in that role rather than any other countryprovided that they were convinced that the United kingdom was sympathetically disposed towards their aspirationsto independence, to eventual union with Somalia, andto the return of the grazing lands in the Haud and reserved Area.The grant of independence to Somalia in I960 will encourage Somalis in Kenya to think in terms of union with Somalia, and this tendency will be strengthened byany statement by Her Majestyrs Government sympathisingwith a union between the Protectorate and Somalia.Furthermore, if Somalis outside Kenya are freed entirely from European control, the pressure of their traditionalsouthward and westward drive into Kenya is bound to increa
2 05. Against this background various policies open to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment may be considered but first it is necessary to reject two possibilities that immediately occur:-(I) That the project of a Greater Somalia comprisingall Somali territories, as originally put forward by Mr. Bevin in 1946 should be revived.This is not now considered to be practical politics.(II) That the Protectorate should b   grantedindependence in I960 and allowed to unite withSomalia.Granting premature independence to allow the Protectorate to throw in its lot with an independentSomalia which in its early years is likely to be in a highly unstable state has nothing to commend it so longas Somali thinking in the Protectorate remains alongpresent lines.    hi fact, our obligations to ProtectorateSomalis dictate that we should protect and guide them until the situation in Somalia after the grant of independence has become clear.6. Should we then try to carry on as at present, continuing - inaccordance with our general Colonial policy - to promote the economic,social and political development of the Protectorate at a reasonable pace,acknowledging our eventual aim of self-government but realising andadmitting that it is likely to take a very long time to achieve?    If it were practicable, there would be much to be said for that course;  for the facts of economics and geography rule out any prospect of genuine self-governmenton a reasonable standard of living within the foreseeable future, whilst it isnever possible, once political control of a territory has been abandoned, tobe certain of retaining sufficient influence to secure our strategic needs init.    In fact, however, it seems extremely doubtful whether this course is practicable.    Our withdrawal from the Haud and the approaching independence of Somalia have not as yet caused the Somalis of the Protectorate either to demand immediate independence or to turn against the Protectorateauthorities.     These events have, however, caused the Somalis to startasking v/hen we think they will be ready for independence;  what we thinkabout union or federation of the Protectorate with Somalia;   and what we propose to do to hasten their development so that independence shall not beunnecessarily delayed and they can be put in a position to negotiate with the somalis of Somalia,  and the Ethiopian Government, on equal terms.    Ifwe make no reference to their demands and aspirations, our Somalis mayquickly become estranged and it is likely that before long we shall find our-selves having to hold the Protectorate by force - by no means an impossibleoperation but one not likely to be either inexpensive or palatable to theBritish people.7. Until the future of Somalia becomes clearer, it is not possibleto judge whether some form of closer association between the protectorate and Somalia will be in our interests and those of our Somalis.    Even if suchcloser association takes place - and still more if it does not - it is difficultto envisage any form of self-government for the Somalis other than onewhich, whilst securing our strategic requirements on the one hand, providesat the same time for financial assistance and for some form of assistance,if not control, in the fields of foreign policy and defence.     Because of the
inter-tribal rivalries and the absence of any ruling house, even that degreeof self-government will not be possible until some reasonably stable formof indigenous central government has been developed.8. While, therefore, I support the principle of closer association between the Protectorate and Somalia, I do not think that we can at presentundertake any definite commitment on a date for independence.    But, iffriendly relations are to be maintained with   the Somalis of the protectorate, it is my view that we must accelerate the pace of develop-ment, particularly for education and economic development, and makeit clear that our purpose in doing so ie to increase the speed of their approach to self-government and to place them in as favourable aposition as possible to deal with the problems with which they and we will be faced in the future, particularly in relation to closer association with Somalia.9. I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that I should make, orauthorise the Governor to make, a statement along the following lines:-(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Governments aim is to press ahead witheconomic,  social and political progress in the protectorate.    In particular, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have decided that steps must be taken to accelerate the development of education and ofeconomic resources, having regard always to the physical capacity of the territory.(b) The object of this development is to prepare the somalis of the Protectorate for self-government.But it is too early to say when they will be ready for self-government and Her Majesty&apos;s Government isnot laying clown a definite time-table.(c) The possibility of closer association with Somalia isclearly a matter which will have to be considered and which will need to be discussed between us andthe Somalis of the Protectorate at the appropriate time.    I regard the views of the Somalis themselves as a factor of decisive importance and, if theconditions prove favourable, we would support awell-conceived plan for closer association.    (it is,however, obvious that it will not be possible to reach a firm commitment until the state of affairs inSomalia at the relevant time becomes clear.)(d) The Protectorate&apos;s territorial integrity is guaranteedfor as long as the territory remains under her Majesty&apos;s Governments protection.    (this statement is necessary in order to allay Somalisuspicions arising from our withdrawal from the ogaden, and the Haud and the Reserved Area.)10. Before such a statement could be made it would be necessary to consult the French Government and to inform the Italian and EthiopianGovernments.
ii.In addition to deciding what our attitude is to be towards thefuture of Somalia, we must give urgent and detailed consideration to our long-term policy with regard to those areas known as the Haud and the reserved Area, without which the Somali stock population, and hence the British Somalis themselves, cannot survive.     So long as these areas remain under Ethiopian rule and Somali opinion remains opposedto Ethiopia, they are bound to remain a source of grave trouble.    if some method could be found of inducing Ethiopia to relinquish the Haud,our problems in the Horn of Africa would be   made immeasurably easier.(The possibility of arranging cession is considered in a separate memorandum being circulated by the        3ign Secretary and myself(CP. (56) 84.)12.I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that -(a)our policy in the Somaliland Protectorate should be onthe lines summarised in paragraph 9 (which areflexible enough to fit into any conclusion that her majesty!s Government is likely to reach in regardto Somalia and the Haud);   and(b)an announcement of policy on those lines should bemade as soon as necessary processes of consultationwith foreign Governments have been completed.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.23rd March, 1956.
