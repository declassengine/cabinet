-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (56) 82 COPY NO.   S&quot;Q19th March,  1956.CABINETLEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Lord Privy SealWhen the Cabinet reviewed, on 22nd February, the 1955-56legislative programme, it was agreed that v/e would consider at a later meeting whether, in view of the pledges given in connection with the family Allowances (Amendment) Bill, we should attempt to enact it inthe current session.     (C.M.(56) 16th Conclusions, Minute 8),2.        Even the severely curtailed programme outlined in my paper c.P. (56) 42 is likely, as I there indicated, to involve us in an extensionof the present session into the autumn for some four or five weeks, andto involve a correspondingly late opening of the 1956-57 session.     Thisis even more true now that v/e have to find time for legislation on the death penalty, on Caribbean Federation, and on Public Works Loans -all of which were treated in my earlier paper as only possibilities but have now become practically certainties.    We cannot, therefore, be certain - at least until the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill has made some progress in Committee - whether we shall have any legislativetime at all in hand.     But even if some margin of time does eventuallyemerge, the Family Allowances Bill (which was, of course, foreshadowed in The Queen&apos;s Speech) must now compete not only with the Workmen&apos;compensation Bill, to which I referred in my earlier paper, but also with a new Bill, designed to give effect to the increases in payments to widows which were dealt with in the announcement by the Minister ofPensions on 27th February.    The Health and Social Security Committeeof the Party are pressing for early action on this front;   and they haveexpressed great dissatisfaction with the delay which will otherwiseintervene between the Minister&apos;s announcement and the date when pay-ment will first be made to those concerned.    The Health and social security  Committee are, of course, not alone in holding these views.A short Bill, to do at least two of the most urgent things recommendedby the National Insurance Advisory Committee (i. e. to increase by5s. Od. the allowance paid to a widow in respect of each of her children,and to reduce from ten-years to three years the qualifying period of marriage for entitlement to widow s pensions) could be drafted fairlyquickly.3.        In addition, but as a separate point, it has now been discovered that the Colonial Development Corporation have undertakencertain housing schemes which are ultra vires, and that legislation is urgently needed to rectify this deficiency in their powers.    Theschemes in question have had the full approval of the ministers concerned, both of this Government and of the Socialist Government.4.        It is impossible, at present to guarantee that we shall be ableto find time for any of these Bills - at least on the basis of our
existing time-table.    I should, therefore, value my colleagues&apos; viewson the question whether we should definitely plan to secure the enactment of one or more of these Bills in the present session^ even if this involves a further curtailment of the summer recess, or whether, while makingevery effort to find time for at least some of them, we should be preparedto let all of them stand over, if necessary^ until next session.    Each ofthem, particularly Family Allowances, is liable to provoke a certainamount of debate;   but none is contentious on a major scale, or likelyto make any considerable demands on the time of the House of Lords.Moreover, they are Bills which the Oppopi&apos; on are unlikely to obstructin principle;   and the possibility of an arrangement to facilitate their passage need not be ruled out at this stage.    Indeed. Mr. Marquand,from the Opposition front bench, said that the Opposition would certainlydo all in their power to hasten the passage of legislation on widows if itwere introduced at once.    A number of back bench Opposition members have also approached the Minister of Pensions with a view to making asimilar arrangement in respect of V/orkmen&apos;s Compensation.5.        We have therefore as embarrassing additions to an overcrowdedprogramme the following Bills - National Insurance, Family Allowances,Workmen&apos;s Compensation, Colonial Development Corporation.    I do not see how we can, with any certainty, make time for more than one ofthese, and the Cabinet must choose.     The choice lies between a Bill to validate the actions of the Colonial Development Corporation or one ofthe three possible social services Bills with the further possibility,which cannot be assessed at this stage, that if a social services Bill ischosen the Opposition may be prepared to facilitate the passage of all three Bills in this category.R.A.B.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1. ,19th March, 1956.
