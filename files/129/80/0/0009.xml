9 0&amp; O(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P, (56) 5920th February, 1956CABINETIMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES FOR THEORGANISATION FOR TRADE CO-operation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Economic Policy Committee concluded on 22nd February(E0P.(56) 5th Meeting, Item 4) that we should now sign the agreement onthe Organisation for Trade Co-operation (O.T.C.).    It is by no means certain that the organisation will ever come into being but, if it does,Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be committed by our signature to grant itcertain immunities and privileges.    I am therefore bringing the matter to the attention of my colleagues as a matter of emergency before weactually sign.background. In July, 1952, theCabinet asked the Foreign Secretary &quot;to give them early notice of any new proposal to extend immunities and privileges to other international agencies&quot; (C.C.(52) 75th Conclusions,Minute 6).COPY NO. :iO3. A review of fhe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T0) was conducted at Geneva between October, 1954, and March,1955.    In a statement of policy published on 19th April, 1955 Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment declared their support for the revised General Agreement(Comd. 9413).4. One product of the review of the G.A. T.T. is the agreement to establish the O.T0C, which will administer the CA.T.T.    The Agree-ment on the O.T.C, provides for the grant of certain immunities and privileges to the Organisation:&quot;The privileges and immunities to be accordedby a Member to the Organisation, to its officials, andto the representatives of its members shall be similarto those accorded by that Member to specialised agencies of the United Nations, to their officials andto the representatives of their Members, under theConvention on the Privileges and Immunities of the specialised Agencies, or under similar arrangements&quot;.(Article 10(d)).5. Briefly, the effect of this will be that the Organisation^premises and archives will be inviolable;  its assets, income and propertywill be exempt from direct taxation;  it will not pay customs duties on articles imported for official use;  its officers and representatives of
member states attending meetings convened by the Organisation will beimmune from legal process when acting in an official capacity, and their official emoluments will be exempt from taxation.    As the seat of theO.T.C. will be in Geneva, in practice these immunities will not amountto very much from the point of view of the United Kingdom.     They will arise in most cases only when officials of the Organisation and represent -atives of member states pass through the United Kingdom, or if aConference is held by the Organisation in the United Kingdom, such as theTariff Conference held by the G.A.T.T. at Torquay in 1951.6. The Agreement on the O.T.Ce was opened for signaturein Geneva on 10th March, 1955, but will not enter into force until the major contracting parties to the CA.T.T., including the United States ofAmerica, have accepted it.     A Bill authorising United States acceptanceof the C.T.C. is now before the United States Congress, audit has beendecided that, in order to assist this Billrs passage, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should sign the Agreement at once.7. In order to grant the necessary immunities and privilegesan Order-in-Council made under the International Organisations (immunities and Privileges) Acts 1950, will be required.     This order will be similar in form and content to Orders already made in respect of other international organisations and it will be timed to come into operation on the date on whichthe Agreement on the O.T.C. comes into effect for the United Kingdom.0. If the Order is criticised in Parliament the answer could(a) the agreement on C.T.C. was negotiated early in1955 before the pressure against the extensionof privileges and immunities became so apparent;(b) the G.A.T.T. is an essential instrument in our foreign trade policy.    It is therefore fitting thatthe C.T.C. which will administer the G.A.T.T.should enjoy appropriate privileges and immunities;(c) the headquarters of the organisation will be in geneva and it will therefore be only on rare occasionsthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be required totake action under the Order.be:-conclusions .(i)In accordance with the decision referred to inparagraph 2 above I ask my colleagues to take note of the proposed extension of immunities and privileges.I would propose to present the necessary draft order -in-Council at the appropriate time.If our signature is to have the maximum effect in theUnited States it may have to be made on or before 1st Marchwhen congressional hearings on the OsT,C. Bill begin.If any of my colleagues disagree with the course proposed Ishould therefore be grateful if they would inform me by the evening of 20th February.S.L,Foreign Office, S.W.1.20th February, 1956.
