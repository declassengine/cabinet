(.&quot;$ A PA tiMy&quot;&apos;&quot;-r..(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA/KSTY/S GOVERNMENT)SECRET C6,- /o,1       ACP.(56) 95 COPY NO.9th. April, 1956CABINETFAMILY ALLOWANCES AND the bread SUBSIDYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 21st March, 1956, the Cabinet agreed that theBill on Family Allowances referred to in The Queers Speech should beadded to the legislative programme for the current session (C.M.(56) 24thConclusions, Minute 8).2. I have been considering this Bill (which it is now agreed shouldalso deal with widows) in relation to the bread subsidy.    I attach greatimportance to being able to say in my Budget speech that the remainder ofthe bread subsidy will be removed altogether on a definite date, later in theyear.    The Family Allowances and Widows Bill gives us an opportunity of associating the removal of the rest of the bread subsidy with a measure ofmitigation of its effect on large families at a reasonable cost.    What I have in mind is that our proposed Bill should be enlarged by adding a provision that family allowances should be increased by 2s. a week for each child inthe family after the second, so that the rates would be 8s. for the secondchild and 10s. for the third and each subsequent child.     The cost of increasingthe allowances in this way would be just under  10 millions in a full year.The saving on the abolition of the rest of the bread subsidy would be 20 millions or more in a full year.3. If legislation on family allowances could be passed by the end ofJuly, it could be put into operation on 1st October.     I propose therefore that I should say in my Budget speech that both changes will be made effective on that date.    As this is not technically a part of the Budget, andwill be implemented in legislation other than the Finance Bill, I am consultingmy colleagues in this paper rather than leaving the proposal for oralexposition when they have my Budget as a whole before them.H.M.
