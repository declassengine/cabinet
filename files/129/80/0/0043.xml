Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1956.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 5 1CP. (56) 934th April, 1956CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in February 1954, the Cabinet considered the action to be taken onConvention (No. 101) concerning holidays with pay in agriculture, which wasadopted by the International Labour Conference at its 35th Session in 1952, and decided that the Government should not ratify the Convention (C.C. (54)9th Conclusions, Minute 12); this decision was presented to Parliament in cmd. 9082, and subsequently communicated to the Director-General of theInternational Labour Office. In view of representations that have been receivedhowever, it is now proposed that the Government should ratify the Convention forthe reasons given in the following paragraphs.2. The text of the Convention was presented to Parliament in Cmd. 8825and its provisions are summarised in the Annex to this paper. The principalrequirement is that workers employed in agricultural undertakings and relatedoccupations shall be granted an annual holiday with pay after a period of continous service with the same employer. The reasons why it was previously proposed, and agreed by the Cabinet, that the Government should not ratify theConvention were that although the Agricultural Wages Boards in England andWales and in Scotland are empowered under the Agricultural Wages Acts to make orders, having the force of law, fixing holidays with pay for agricultural workers,and have in fact made such Orders, the exercise of these powers is not obligatorybut lies within the discretion of the Boards; that it might be regarded as inconsistent with this discretion for the Government to assume an obligation to ensure the effective application of the Convention; that if such a responsibility were accepted in regard to holidays with pay there was a danger that this might give rise in thefuture to demands for Government intervention in regard to other matters withinthe discretion of the Boards; and that this might in turn have repercussions on theoperation of statutory wage-fixing machinery generally.3. Since the previous decision was taken, strong representations have beenreceived from the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) that theGovernment should reconsider their decision not to ratify the Convention. Theyargued that the practice in this country was in conformity with the provisions ofthe Convention and that, from the practical point of view, there was nothing toprevent ratification. But their main concern was that failure to ratify was having a deplorable effect abroad, particularly in Colonial territories, where the reasonsfor the United Kingdom attitude were not understood and the consequentmisunderstandings were exploited for their own purposes by Communist-dominated organisations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions. On this latter ground particularly the T.U.C. pressed most strongly that the Governmentshould ratify the Convention.4. In these circumstances it seemed right to re-examine very carefully thepossibility of ratification and the practical implications of doing so. There is nodoubt that the practice in the United Kingdom as represented by the decisions ofthe Agricultural Wages Boards is fully in accordance with all the requirements ofthe Convention, and its ratification would not require the Government to take49751
Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1956.AnnexPROVISIONS OF THE convention the Convention provides that workers employed in agricultural undertakings and related occupations shall be granted an annual holiday with pay after a periodof continuous service with the same employer. How such provision shall be made,and how the minimum period of continuous service and the minimum duration ofthe annual holiday with pay are to be determined, whether, for instance, by meansof collective agreements or by entrusting the regulation of holidays with pay to special bodies, and to which undertakings or occupations the Convention shall beapplied, are matters for decision by governments themselves in consultation with representative organisations of workers and employers. Other questions to bedecided by appropriate national means include the rates of holiday remuneration,the extent to which the annual holiday with pay may be divided, the treatment tobe accorded to young workers and increases in holidays with length of service. Itis laid down that agreements to relinquish the right to an annual paid holiday shallbe void, and that a person dismissed for a reason other than his own misconductbefore he has taken a holiday due to him shall receive appropriate remuneration.An adequate system of inspection and supervision to ensure the application of theprovisions of the Convention is to be maintained.legislative or other action to secure compliance with its terms. The need to contemplate such action would arise only if the Boards were to decide to discontinue to use their powers or to revise their Orders in such a way as to bringthe provisions for holidays with pay for agricultural workers out of conformitywith the requirements of the Convention. The possibility that the Boards wouldever come to such a decision is extremely remote; so remote indeed, the T.U.C.pressed strongly, that for practical purposes it might be ignored. But even if the boards were to come to such a decision, the Government could decide, rather than to take legislative or other action to override the Board&apos;s decisions, to take thealternative course of defaulting on the obligations of the Convention until it couldbe denounced, which can be done at fixed periods during its currency.5. I propose therefore that the Government should now decide to ratify thisConvention. The White Paper announcing the Governments decision which i will circulate to my colleagues for information in due course, if the proposal is approved would make it clear that the Convention had been ratified on the basisof existing practice.6. Conventions are ratified on behalf of both Great Britain and NorthernIreland. In Northern Ireland the position in relation to this Convention is different from that in Great Britain because there are specific provisions in the currentagricultural wages legislation which cover the Governments obligations under theConvention. The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance of Northern Irelandhave been consulted and agree with the action proposed.I. M.
