(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(56) 71 COPY NO.   U B7th March, 1956CABINETVOLTA RIVER ALUMINIUM scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will be considering Her MajestylsGovernments attitude towards this scheme ori the basis of the proposals put forward in the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s paper(CP.(56) 60).2. These proposals have my full support.    I agree that in ourpresent financial circumstances we cannot shoulder the same proportionof the increased cost of the scheme as we envisaged in 1952 and thatwe should therefore seek to enlist the support of the International Bank.3, I must also underline the warning in paragraph 8 of theFresident&apos;s paper that our withdrawal from the scheme would adversely affect our influence on and relations with West Africa for years to come.    Apart from this, the example of the Aswan dam andthe Indian steel works has not been overlooked in Africa and therewould be no surer way of driving the present anti-Communist gold coast Government to seek economic ties with the Soviet bloc than to fail in our endeavours to bring the Volta scheme to fruition.A. L. -B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.6th March, 1956.
