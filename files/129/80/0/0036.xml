Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 5CP. (56) 8623rd March, 1956CABINETTHE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRITISH council memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs. The ProblemCultural diplomacy is recognised to-day as an indispensable weapon in thearmoury of foreign policy. The experience of twenty-one years (confirmed bynumerous investigations, of which the most recent was that of Lord Drogheda&apos;sIndependent Committee which reported in 1953) has shown that we cannot dowithout the British Council, which wields this weapon on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.2. The Cabinet have confirmed this estimate by allotting to the british council an important part in the measures to safeguard our interest in Middle Eastoil. But the Council can play this part only if it is adequately staffed with the bestpeople available. At present the Council has not enough staff to carry out its existing commitments properly, let alone expand to the extent required by the cabinet&apos;s plans; and it is unable to attract recruits of the right calibre.3.   The remedies are:  (a) to provide a satisfactory pension scheme based on retirement salary; and(b) to offer a reasonable assurance of continuity of employment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that the Treasury, the Foreign Officeand the British Council together should work out a suitable contributory pension scheme similar to that applied to public employees outside the Civil Service; andthe plans for this scheme are now well advanced. But the second remedy, without which the first would have no effect, remains to be applied. A suitable form forsuch assurance would be a statement in the House of Commons.II. The Background4. In the years immediately following the war the British Council was allowed to expand very rapidly, with the result that a part of the staff recruitedwas of the wrong type. The subsequent retrenchment enabled the Council to get rid of these people; but at the same time it ruined the Councils reputation as an employer. University Appointments Boards, whose co-operation is essential, arenow unwilling to recommend applicants to an organisation which offers no securityof tenure and is constantly threatened by retrenchment.5. In 1951 British Council salaries and allowances were assimilated to thoseof certain grades of the Foreign Service. In 1953 the Drogheda Committeecommented (Chapter 6 of Annex 2 of their report), &quot; one cannot expect to keepgood men if there is no security in their employment if they feel that at any moment their jobs may disappear and all their work be wasted .... weunderstand that negotiations are in progress between the Treasury and the british council to establish a permanent service for the British Council on more or less the lines of the Foreign Service. We certainly recommend that this should bebrought about.&quot;49735
III. recommendation. That, in reply to a question in the House, a statement should be made, inthe terms of the attached draft, to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government regard the British Council as a permanent feature of our Overseas Services.7. This draft of a Question and Answer omits mention of the pension scheme,since the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not wish to invite criticism for applyingsuch a scheme to the British Council and not to other similar bodies. Referencewould, therefore, only be made to it if the question was pressed in a Supplementary.8. My colleagues at the Commonwealth Relations Office and the ColonialOffice concur with me in asking the Cabinet to agree that such a statement shouldbe made in the House of Commons as soon as possible.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,22nd March, 1956.Parliamentary question to ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he will make astatement about the British Council, in view of the difficulty which the council has in recruiting staff because of doubts as to its permanence.ReplyIt is of great importance that recruits of good quality should come forward to enable the British Council to fulfil its responsibilities. The Council has nowexisted for twenty-one years, during which time it has served a most useful purpose,and Her Majesty&apos;s Government wish it to be known that it is their hope and intention that the Council shall remain a permanent feature of British overseas services.
