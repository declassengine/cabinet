(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCC.P8(56) 8013th March, 1956.THE ERITISH INDUSTRIES FAIRMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn 1953 the Economic Policy Committee agreed(E0A0(53) 27th Meeting, Item 3) that responsibility for the BritishIndustries Fair should be transferred to a limited company, the directors of which were chosen by four trustees, i. e. the President of theFederation of British Industries, the National Union of Manufacturers tthe Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Trades UnionCongress.    Under the British Industries Fair (Guarantees and Grants)Act, 1954, the Treasury have giventhis company a guarantee in respectof their borrowing up to  100,000:  the Board of Trade were alsoauthorised to make grants towards the company&apos;s publicity.     these latter grants are at present at the rate of  100, 000 a year.2. In 1954/5 the complications involved in setting up thecompany gave its board little chance to rally industry to the fair and the deficit in the year to 30th June, 1955, was over  35,000.    In the second year a great effort has been made.     To suit trade habits, half the Londonsection was brought forward from April to February.     This year&apos;s fairs,nevertheless, are not proving a. success and the directors of J,F, Limited have informed me that their losses will exceed  100, 000within the next few weeks, and by September will amount to  150, 000.They have asked the Government to increase its guarantee to  500, 000;they believe that with this assistance there is a reasonable chance that theycould make the fair a success in a few years&apos; time.     To meet their requestlegislation would be needed.3. I do not share the directors&apos; optimism.     The reasons for thecornpany&apos;s present financial position are that their overheads were considerably higher than they expected;   the rent they have been chargingto exhibitors is too low, and yet the number of exhibitors is declining.I see no reason for expecting this trend to be reversed,  since industriesappear more and more to prefer their own specialised fairs.    In thesecircumstances, I think it would be wrong to put more public money intothe BoI0F. , and we cannot expect industry itself to put up funds.    Thealternative of turning the fair into an international one, which might enable it to pay its way, does not commend itself to the industrial organisations here.4. I therefore propose to tell the directors of B.I.F. Limitedthat the Government cannot increase its guarantee, recognising that thiswill force them to bring to an end the London B.I.F.    This will cause a shock and provoke criticism, but we should incur more justifiedcriticism if we continued to prop up by increased subsidies a fair toCOPY NO.41CABINET
1G1which British industry is not prepared to give enough support to enable it to pay its way.    I have no doubt that we could get better value for themoney which we now give to the B0I0F,, if it was spent on promoting our export trade in other ways.5. The closing of the London section of the B.I0F. need not affect the Birmingham section, which is run independently by theChamber of Commerce without assistance from the Government, exceptfor its contribution to overseas publicity.    i believe that this sectioncould and would carry on without Government assistance.60 I propose to meet the criticism which we must expect intwo ways - by so far as possible diverting attention to the continuanceof the Birmingham section as a self-supporting fair, and by using thepublic money hitherto spent on publicising the B.I.F. for trade promotionoverseas, particularly by improving the scale and number of officialdisplays at overseas trade fairs.    We have come in for a good deal of criticism on this score lately, e.g. at the Karachi and Delhi fairs lastyear.7. The finances of B0I0F, Ltd. are such that, once the board are told that there will be no bigger guarantee, the directors  would be liable to proceedings under the Companies Act if they did not go intoimmediate liquidation.     This would make it impossible to hold the fairplanned at Olympia from 23rd April - 4th May.    I am advised that, ifthis fair is not held, the loss is likely to be bigger than if it goesforward:  and certainly the criticism of our decision would be greatlyreinforced.    Moreover, the Government seem   to me morally obligedto pay the company&apos;s debts, even if they exceed the  100, 000 guaranteed.8. i therefore propose to tell the board that, provided thatthe company is wound up as soon as practicable after 4th May, theGovernment will assume liability for its residual indebtedness, even ifthe total is above the Treasury guarantee of  100, 000.    I propose tocover any requirements for this purpose by a Supplementary Estimateon the Board of Trade Vote.    As public knowledge of what is in storev/ould do great damage to the Olympia fair, no announcement of any kind will be made until it is over.9. I have discussed these proposals with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and he is in agreement with them.10. I ask my colleagues to agree that:(a)   the guarantee to British Industries Fair Limitedshould not be extended:(b) the company should be wound up as soon aspracticable after the end of the Olympia fair;(c) the Government should assume responsibility forany debts incurred by the company even if theyexceed  100,000 and that I should present a supplementary Estimate for the purpose;(d) the public money spent on publicising the BritishIndustries Fair should henceforward be devoted toother methods of export promotion and in particular to improving official displays at overseas fairs.P0 T0Board of Trade, S0W.l.13th March, 1956.
