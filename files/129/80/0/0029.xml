THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS government secret, (56) 79 COPY NO,12th March, 1956CABINETSUPPLY OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO india memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and &quot;the Minister of DefenceThere have been developments in the negotiations for the supply ofBritish aircraft to India since this matter was discussed by the Cabinet on31st January, 1956 (CM. (56) 8th Conclusions, Minute 1),2.      The Foreign Secretary reported (in Delhi telegrams Nos. 386 and307) that Mr. Nehru had indicated that India would probably purchase someRussian I. L. 20 bombers.    The Prime Minister thereupon sent a personal message to Mr. Nehru (Commonwealth Relations Office telegram No. 646to Delhi), and Departments ha.ve been considering what further offer mightbe made to the Indians in a final effort to dissuade them from purchas-ing Russian aircraft.3.      Our latest firm offer to the Indians was 63 Canberras, of which45 were to be B. 0s - the latest mark of Canberra bomber which is onlynow beginning to be delivered to the R. A. F.    20 of the 45 were to be delivered by the middle of 1957.     The Indians attach great importance to early deliveries, and asked a few days ago for 20 more fully-equippedCanberra type bombers by the middle of 1957.4. We are advised that the only method of meeting this total Indianrequirement with types of aircraft that they would be likely to accept isas follows J-(1)    Of the extra 20, 11 could be fully-equipped B.0s(making 31 B. 0s in all by mid-1957).     This isthe most that the firm will be able to equip withthe Green Satin navigational aid and the new T.4bomb-sight by that date,(2)    The remaining 9 would have to be B, 6s - the mark of Canberra bomber now in squadron service withthe R. A. F.    These aircraft would have to be re-purchased by the firm from the R. A. F. , to whom they have already been delivered.    It may just bepossible to fit these 9 with Green Satin and T.4,allowing time for trial installation, before thetechnicians have to turn to equipping the B.0s.5.      Our High Commissioner in Delhi has indicated that an offer of lessthan 20 might be sufficient.    Because of the doubt about the firm!capacity to fit the B. 6s in time, it might be preferable to start by offer-
ing the additional B.Os referred to in 4(1) above, and keep the B. 6s as afinal offer.     This is a matter of tactics which we must leave to our negotiators.6.      The effect of the full offer on the R, A. F, would be asfollows ;-(a) The re-adjustment of production lines would causedelays of three months in the delivery of photo -reconnaissance types of Canberra to the R. A. F, ,and impose a similar delay on build-up of these aircraft in 2nd Tactical Air Force.(b) One out of the five existing B.6 squadrons of bomber command would have to be closed down.(c) There would be a delay of about a year in the build-upof the second B. 0 squadron in 2nd Tactical Air Force.(d) The R. A. F. would itself be short of Green Satinequipment for a period of some months in 1957.The shortages could not be allowed to affect theV bomber force, but would probably affectCanberras.(e) There v/ould be no reserve of T.4 bomb sights forthe V bombers for a period in 1957.7.      The Secretary of State for Air has agreed to accept this detrimentif Ministers decide that the further offer must be made.     He would do thison condition that:-(a) All V bombers in the R. A. F. are given priority overthe Indians for Green Satin and the T.4 bomb-sight.If production goes as planned, it should just bepossible to meet the Indian requirement and equipthe V bombers, but if production falls back theV bombers must have priority.(b) In settling Air Estimates for future years accountwill be taken of the fact that additional costs will arise in buying Canberras which would otherwise have been bought earlier.(c) The Air Ministry is not asked to accept furtherdetriment to the Canberra 13. 0 Force arising froma possible export of these aircraft to Venezuela.It would of course be necessary to inform the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe, about the effects on 2nd Tactical Air Force.0.      The proposals would also delay deliveries of Green Satin and theT.4 bomb sight to the Australians, who have placed substantial ordersfor these items, and the position would have to be explained to them.
is9.      Financially, v/e should be conceding up to  10, 000 per aircraftout of the normal research and development levy.     This was agreed tcby the Cabinet for the original proposal to supply 63 aircraft, and wouldhave to be extended to the further 20.     The re-purchase of B. 6s byEnglish Electric from the Air Ministry might raise further financialissues.    English Electric have also asked for contract cover to theextent of  20, 000 in order that they may put in hand at once, before anycontracts have been signed, the necessary preliminary design work andadvance ordering of materials for the aircraft to be supplied to India,in order to meet the delivery dates put forward.10,     We consider that if we make this further offer it should be on the-clear understanding that the Indians would not purchase any Russian air^crafty    it is, however, probably not too soon to begin considering what our attitude is to be if, as seems possible,   despite this further offer,the Indians persist in purchasing even one squadron of Russian aircraft.There is no obvious course of action, and we should welcome thepreliminary views of our colleagues as guidance in formulatingrecommendations should the need arise.11.     We should perhaps make it clear that there would be no possibility of meeting any request from Pakistan for early deliveries of Canberra aircraft, should one be made when news of the Indian purchabecame known.12, We ask our colleagues to decide whether the furthermaximum offer set out in paragraph 4 should be made, on the conditionsproposed by the Secretary of State for Air (paragraph 7) and by us(paragraph 10);  and to inform us of their preliminary views on theattitude we should adopt if, despite all our efforts, the Indians persistin purchasing even one squadr on of Russian aircraft.H.W0M.12th March,1956.
