AGRICULTURE ACT, 1 947ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION OF GUARANTEES, 1 956I.  introduction.      The 1956 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has now been held in accordance with section 2 of the Agriculture Act, 1947.    In the light of it theGovernment have determined the guarantees for livestock and livestock products in the year April, 1956, to March, 1957, andfor crops from the 1 957 harvest.    These are set out in Appendix V.2.      A Special Review,  on account  of changes in wage costs, hasbeen held concurrently with the Annual Review and the results are given in Appendix VI.    These Special Review determinationsrelate to crops of the 1956 harvest,  and to livestock products of 1955/56 - i.e.  in each case a year earlier than the period to which the present Annual Review determinations relate.II. Economic Condition of the Agricultural IndustryProduction Progress3.     Agricultural net output for the year 1955/56 is forecast at55 per cent above pre-war. The revised index for last year, 1954/55,is 51  per cent above pre-war.    Last year&apos;s outcome was seriously affected by the weather.    The volume of net output is now backto the 1953/54 level, which was the highest previously recorded.This reflects credit on the endeavours of the industry.    Theresult has been achieved despite a substantial fall in tillagearea and pig production.    These declines have been offset byrecord yields of cereal crops,  a better hay harvest (with a consequential fall in imports of feedingstuffs) and a continuing upward trend in the output of milk and eggs.Breeding for production of beef, mutton and lamb continuesto expand./
Changes in Cosies -4.      Statistics of changes in costs are shown in Appendix III.There is a substantial increase again this year,  estimated to amountto about  4-3 million in a year for all commodities,  and about  35million for review commodities.    Disregarding the reductions in thecost of feed for pigs and eggs, which are reflected automatically inadjustments to the guarantees for those commodities,  the figures would be about  45 million for all commodities and just under  37million for review commodities.    Apart from feed costs, whichcannot be apportioned,   some  1 2 million of increased costs onreview commodities will have already affected net income in thecurrent year 1955/56,  leaving about  24 million on review commoditiesstill to take effect on future net income.Efficiency5.      The annual increase in efficiency, arising primarily fromimprovements in husbandry and farm management, can only be estimatedbroadly.    The Government assessed this a year ago at something like 30 million a year for the industry as a Yviiole and about  25 million a. year for review commodities.    They have examined alternative ways of assessing this and have concluded that there are reasonable grounds on which to credit agriculture with an increase of some 30 million a. year for the industry as a whole,which is equivalentto about 2 per cent of gross output.Changes in Income6.      The forecast of total net income for 1955/56 is  299? million,and compares with  285&apos;g- million in 1 954/55&quot;    When adjusted for normal weather conditions,  the net income is estimated at , 292-g- million for1 955/56;    the comparable figure for 1954/55 was  320? million.    the outcome forecast for 1955/56 does not fully reflect the recoverythat is taking place from the actual level of net income in 1954/55when the weather1 was so bad.    This is due to a number of factorsapart from the continuing effect of that year&apos;s exceptional weather.For example,  in the case of crops lower guaranteed prices for the1 955 harvest had been determined after the 1954 Annual Review,
whereas the higher prices determined after the 1955 Review will not take effect until the 1956 harvest; and there has been an increase,compared with 1954/55, in stocks and- work in progress at the end ofthe year,  on which no profit is reckoned until the output is sold.Economic Condition of the Industry7.     The Government&apos;s assessment of the economic condition of theindustry is as follows.    Output has recovered from the setback in1954/55, hut the industry is having to bear a substantial burden of increased costs.    Favourable factors at work are the increasing efficiency of the industry and the continuing effects of the 1955Annual Review award,  some of which have not so far been felt.But on balance the industry needs a further increase in the valueof the guarantees.III. Production and Guarantee policy.      Production and guarantee policy have been reviewed and thepolicy of the Government is set out in the immediately following paragraphs.Production Policy9.      The Government have considered whether agricultural productionpolicy as hitherto stated requires to be revised in the light ofthe balance of payments problems that face the United Kingdom.Factors to be considered are:- the possible saving of direct importsof food by additional home production, and the additional importsof animal feedingstuffs that might be required for this purpose;the possible saving of imported feedingstuffs;    the benefit to thebalance of payments and to the national income of a further increasein home agricultural production compared with that which could beobtained from other industries using the labour, materials and financewhich the increase in agricultural production might require;    and thenet advantage of any possible import saving,  having regard to the sources of the imports and their place in our general overseas trade.10.      The conclusion is that national requirements can best be met by intensifying the policy developed since 1 952.    The objective ofproduction policy remains the most that can be produced economically and efficiently in accordance with market requirements,
steadily increasing technical efficiency and diminishing unitcost.    But even greater emphasis than before must be put on thesubstitution of home-grown products (mainly grass and otherfeedingstuffs) for imports,  and on economies in the use of imported materials.    If this is done it will increase the net output ofagriculture more economically than would an indiscriminate expansionof end-products;    and will bring greater and more certain relief tothe balance of paynents.    The agricultural industry will be expandin,a side of its business - that which is concerned with its rawmaterial supplies - which offers the greatest scope for development.11.      This ca.n best be done by a vigorous continuation of thepolicy of :-(i) maintaining a large arable area with emphasis on feedcrops that can be used to replace imports,  on temporarygrass and on improving crop yields;(ii) improving the standards of our temporary and permanentgrass and our techniques for conservation,  and encouraging the increased use of grass in the production of beef,mutton and milk;(iii) using feed to the best advantage by economy and skillin our feeding methods.Commodity policy 2.      The main features of current production appear to be a continuing long-term expansion in the production of beef, mutton and lamb;  a lower level in output of pigmeat than the peak of1954/55;    and a continuing trend of relatively small increases in the outpirt of milk and eggs.    Although tillage area   has been falling, crop production, particularly of grain crops,  is atpresent-fairly stable because of an increase in crop yields.The increase in the area under grass has outstripped the increasein grass-eating animals.
1 3.    The main directions in which the Government would wish to seeproduction developed continue to he as follows:-(a) a large arable area should be maintained; this will need to include a large tillage area, but the emphasis shouldbe more on feed crops (barley and oats, other feed crops and high quality leys),  and on improving crop yields;(b) the production of beef, mutton and lamb should beincreased;(c) more of the milk output should be produced from home-producedfeed;(d) for pigs and eggs, which are largely dependent on importedfeeds,  the major concern   continues to be to reduce costs of production and,  in the case of pigs,  to relate them more closely to the costs of our overseas suppliers while-still improving quality.Guarantee Policy14-      The long-term objective continues to be to achieve a steadyimprovement in the competitive position of the industry.    To do this the industry must concentrate on reducing unit costs of production,meeting consumer choice,  and raising quality.    The total costof the Exchequer support given to agriculture has been lessduring the current financial year than it was in 1954/55.    Thisis partly due to the industry&apos;s success in improving quality and responding to consumer choice in ways that have helpedduring the recent past to improve returns from the market forsome products.    But the cost to the Exchequer is still highand it is important that the industry should continue to do all that it can to reduce its need for support.
I^..   Determination of Guarantees15* The following are the Governments determinations of the guarantees for livestock and livestock products in the year 1956/57and for crops from the 1957 harvest.    Additional details are givenin Appendix V.Fat Cattle, Sheep and Lambs16. There is still a need for more good quality beef, mutton and lamb;    though for mutton and lamb at least the longer termprospects depend on further reduction in unit costs of production.The standard price for fat cattle is being increased to 151s. Od.a live cwt.    The standard price for fat sheep and lambs will beincreased to 3s. 2d.    a lb.  estimated dressed carcase weight.17* The large increase in the standard price for fat cattle hasbeen made to give further encouragement to beef production.   Aslong-term planning is particularly important to producers of fatcattle,  the Government further assure them that they regard a high level of guarantee as a necessary part of their long-term policy for beef production.18. The classes of cattle eligible for the guarantee have been reviewed.    It has been decided that the minimum standard for steersand heifers should be raised from 50 per cent to 54- per centkilling-out percentage.    For 1956/57 special young cows willcontinue to be within the scope of the guarantee.Fat Pigs19* Production of pigmeat has fallen from the peak level of1954/55? but the rate of subsidy is still high;    in the current financial year the subsidy represents about one-third of themarket value of pigs certified under the guarantee arrangements.It would not be desirable to encourage any renewed expansion untilboth production costs and the unit rate of subsidy can be reduced.Overriding importance must continue to be attached toimprovement in quality and substantial reduction in costs.
The guarantee already reflects changes in feed costs which account for a large part of the costs of production.    The Government have accordingly decided that a small further reduction of 6d.a score should be made in the standard price for pigs.20.     For the livestock year 1956/57 a quality premium will be payable, but on a higher standard than hitherto.   Moreover, inaccordance with their policy of encouraging the production of carcasesof the quality required by tne market,  the Government intend tointroduce a more rigorous specification.    A minimum carcase lengthmeasurement will be introduced with effect from 25th March, 1957* or at an earlier date,  subject to six months&apos; notice, and the otherspecifications may be modified, subject to six months&apos; notice.Fatstook Guarantee System21.     The Government have decided to discontinue the individualguarantees for all classes of fatstock which were a feature of theguarantee scheme introduced in 1954 after the end of control.    these were intended to provide individual producers with a safeguard against any serious imperfections in the auction markets whenprivate trading was restored.    They were not intended to providea floor price for the industry as a whole;    this was unnecessarysince the collective guarantee was designed to make up any deficiencybetween the average market price and the standard price.    In fact the auction markets are now working reasonably well and the stage hasbeen reached when the risks which these arrangements were intendedto meet no longer justify the elaborate machinery involved.    Theindividual guarantees have had the disadvantages of tending to distortthe normal market influences,  of weakening the tone of the marketbecause they may remove some of the seller&apos;s incentive to get the bestprice out of the market, and of complicating the system, with consequent heavy administrative charges.    The Government have thereforecome to the conclusion that the system should, now be simplified bythe withdrawal of this particular feature and the equivalent deadweightguarantees.    This will also mean that in the case of pigs the present
complex of the individual guarantee,  the market addition,   and itsdeadweight equivalent will he eliminated.22.    There will be a single guarantee payment for each group offatstock (cattle,  sheep and pigs) which will be the differencebetween the standard price and the overage of realised prices for that group of fatstock.    This single guarantee payment will be adjusted as and when necessary to ensure that the average totalreturn to producers each week remains vo.th.in the following rangeson either side of the respective standard prices:-cattle - 23s.   Od. per live cwt.: sheep - 4d.  per lb.dressed carcase weight;  and pigs - 5s.  Od.  per score deadweight.The guarantee for pigs will continue to be linked to a standard price of feed.Eggs(Hen and Duck)23.      Production of hen eggs continues to increa.se, but bettermarket prices have reduced slightly the unit cost of subsidy.This is still high, and there is room for further reduction in average costs.    No change is being made in the level of theguarantee for hen eggs.    The guarantee for duck eggs is being reduced to 2s.  Od, per dozen.Milk24.      The general production objective remains as stated in the1954 Annual Review v?hite Paper (Cmd.9104).    There has been no substantial change in the liquid market during the last year,production is still expanding.    It is of great importance that more of the output should be produced from home-grown feed.    It isalso desirable that there should be some change-over from milk tobeef so far as practicable.    Having regard to the increase in costs of production the guarantee is being increased by igd. per gallon,25.      The standard quantities have been reviewed and it has beendecided that for 1956/57 no change should be made for any of the milk marketing areas.
ii 0Ytfool26.    There are special arrangements for a stabilisation fund, butthis is now nearly exhausted.    The Government1s policy remains that,taking one year with another, the guarantee should not requirecontinuing Exchequer payments.    The guaranteed price is being brought down nearer to the current market level, by 2d. per lb.    Asforeshadowed last year, no further request is being made by theGovernment to the British Tool Marketing Board in regard to thespecial bonus on the wool of certain breeds of hill sheep.    This isa matter that should,  in the Governments view, be left to the discretion of the Board.Cereals27.      Cerea.1 production will continue to play an important part inthe maintenance of a large arable acreage based on a rotationalsystem of crops and grass.    Production appears to be generallyprofitable and improved yields will have done more than offset cost increases.    It is important to encourage a greater supply of home-grown feedingstuffs, but at the same time to bring the price guarantees for the different cereal crops more into line with one another.    Wheat is at present getting a disproportionate part of thesubsidy payments on cereals.    At a tine v/hen there are large wheatsurpluses - especially in other Common wealth countries - there is nolonger any special reason to justify exceptional encouragement forthe production of wheat.    The Government have therefore decided toreduce the guaranteed prices for wheat and rye by 1s.  6d. per cwt.On the other hand, to encourage the growing of barley and oats forfeeding to livestock and to assist a number of small farmers andthose farming on some marginal lands, the guaranteed price for barleywill be increased by 6d. per cwt.,  and that for oats by 1s.  6d.per cwt.
Potatoes28.     The guarantee is a support price which is intended to protectproducers against low returns in years of high yield.    The generalproduction objective continues to be that in years of averageyields supplies should be sufficient to meet demand at reasonable prices.29.     The Government have decided that the time has come to excludesub-standard ware potatoes from the scope of the guarantee.    this applies only to Great Britain,  since such potatoes have never been included for Northern Ireland.    Sub-standard ware potatoes were included during the war and postwar years because of the need tomaintain the largest possible acreage, using compulsion when necessary.    In the very different circumstances of today theapplication of the guarantee to potatoes not up to the standardrequired for sale for human consumption can no longer be justified.The definition of ware potatoes has, however&quot;,  been amended so -as toinclude all potatoes which are fit for sale for human consumption in normal conditions.30.      Taking account of these changes, and of increasing costs,  thesupport price for ware potatoes is being increased by 8s.  Od.  per- ten.Sugar Beet31.    The Government wish to see the present sugar beet acreagemaintained.    Account has been taken of cost increases.    The pricedetermined for 1957/58 is 130s.  6d. per ton.Production Grants32.    The Government have reviewed the existing production grants which now amount to about  60 million a year.    They have decided that further encouragement should be given to the use of fertilisers,  sofar as supply and technical considerations allow.    From 1st Julynext increased rates of subsidy will be fixed for nitrogen andphosphates involving (on the rate of consumption in the current year)additional payments of ,B3 million in aggregate.    The maximum rate of grant under the marginal production schemes will also be increased sofar as work on marginal farms is concerned and this is expected to leadto additional expenditure of about  1 million in a full year-.
I 4 *slit33.      The making of more good quality silage, alongside other methods of making improved use of our grassland resources, would contribute most usefully to greater reliance on home-grown feed.This will continue to be encouraged by technical advice anddemonstration.    Any form of direct financial encouragement for silage-making presents considerable difficulties and would require legislation.    While this would, not in any case therefore be practicable for the 1956 season, the possibilities for the future will be considered further in consultation with, the industry.V. Effect of Determinations34-.     As was stated in last year&apos; s Annual Review White Paper(Cmd.9406) the effect of any particular determinations on the net income of the industry cannot be precisely forecast in conditionsof a free economy.    In any event net income is bound to fluctuateappreciably from year to year.    !?he determinations now made increasethe value of the guarantees by  24 million,  and should assist theindustry to secure a satisfactory level of remuneration.35-      Agriculture is still in receipt of large subsidies and the guarantees now determined increase still further the contingentExchequer liability.    The actual cost to the Exchequer will dependon the future trend of market prices and on the volume and kindof   output.    The Government expect that with the assurance of continuing support the industry will be able to maintain a soundposition in the- national economy with diminishing calls on theExchequer in future years.
