*0(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETJC.P,(56) 84COPY NO24th March, 1956.CABINETTHE HORN OF africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for the ColoniesOur colleagues should be aw^re of certain developments in this area, which can be defined as that lying to the East of Longitude 43Q onthe accompanying map.    It is inhabited almost exclusively by Somalisand includes British Somaliland, the Trusteeship territory of Somalia(ex-Italian Somaliland) under Italian administration, and a portion of ethiopia.2. The Somali population, although in many respects backward,is increasing rapidly and is also becoming incxeasingly nationalist-minded.Somalia is due to achieve independence by I960, and may do so before.The effect of this development on the Somalis of the SomalilandProtectorate is considered in the paper on future policy in the Protectorateby the Colonial Secretary (C.P,(56) 89).    The purpose of this paper isto invite consideration of the policy which we should adopt towards anindependent Somalia.3.        The natural resources of Somalia are insufficient to make hereconomy viable without outside help.    At present the Italians subsidiseit to the extent of  2-3 millions a year;   they get nothing in return forthis and there are reports that they wish to withdraw.    We have asked them what their intentions are.4.        The Egyptians are showing an increasing interest in Somalia andalso in the Protectorate.     Because of the lack of Arabic teachers elsewhere the Italians have imported large numbers of Egyptians and Egypt is alsorepresented on the United Nations Advisory Council for Somalia.     Nasseris therefore in a good position to carry on intensive propaganda amongthe Somalis.    An independent Somalia under Egyptian influence, whichmust now be reckoned to carry with it the probability of Russianinfiltration, would be a direct threat to Kenya, which has a considerableSomali population.    If the Sudan were also under Egyptian influence,we should be faced with a pincer movement threatening all our east african territories.5.        If independent Somalia is to be prevented from coming underthe influence of Egypt or the Russians, the West will need to subsidiseher and provide advisers and technical help.     One possibility would befor us to do this alone.    But this might alienate the Italians and the ethiopians;   it would also be expensive.    An alternative would be to forma consortium of Powers (which would have to be acceptable to the Somalisof the Protectorate as well as of Somalia);  not to administer the country,but to provide the necessary financial and technical help.     The Powers
who might be invited to join the consortium would be the four who have responsibility for Somali population (ourselves, France, Italy  and ethiopia - but see paragraph 6)s the United States as the major financialpower of the West, and perhaps Pakistan as a respectable and nearbyMoslem power.    We do not know the views of any of these Powers;but the Italians are also apparently thinking in terms of a consortium;and the Americans and the French  are also aware of the problem posedby expanding Somali nationalism,6*        Logically Ethiopia should certainly take part in the scheme.But there is a long standing hostility between the Ethiopians and the somalis both of the Protectorate and Somalia.    This has beenexacerbated recently by Ethiopian behaviour over the Haud and the reserved Areas.     Such indeed is the resentment of all Somalis, andparticularly our own Somalis, that unless the Ethiopians were preparedto make a major concession over these territories (free access to andcontrol of which is a vital need for our Somalis) aiy attempt to includeEthiopia in a consortium against the wishes of the Somalis would founder,might well drive all Somalis into the arms of the Egyptians, and would create serious disturbances in Somali territories.     But to excludeEthiopia would ensure her opposition to any progressive policy for the somalis.    It might even drive her to seek the support of the Soviet bloc,who are making increasing efforts to penetrate the country.    This would open up an equally serious threat to our East African territories.     Thisquestion is considered further in paragraph 10 below.7.        The Ethiopians are themselves alive to the danger of becomingsurrounded by aggressively nationalist Moslem states.     They alreadysee the Egyptians aiming to dominate the Sudan on their Western borderand they must be aware of Egyptian activities in Somalia.    We there-fore suggest that the delegation which goes to Addis Ababa next monthshould draw their attention to the danger of Egyptian penetration withthe object of persuading the Ethiopian Government that it is in theirown interests to co-operate with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in a moresympathetic policy towards the Somalis.8.        The central question is that of the Haud and there are various ways in which the present resentment of the Somalis might be mitigated.The minimum would be a s-adical   change in the attitude of the ethiopian authorities towards the Somali tribes in the territories coveredby the Agreement of 1954.    The recent conversations in Harar were designed to achieve this but failed in their purpose.    We have consideredthe possibility of a lease of the territories.    We do not consider thatin the long run this would be satisfactory, and in any case the Ethiopiansrefused the idea three years ago.     If they should raise it of their own accord we would however want to examine it again.    But the onlyentirely satisfactory solution from our point of view would be outrightcession of the territories by the Ethiopians to the Protectorate.    from what we know of the Ethiopian attitude to their own territory there is little chance of our achieving this.    But we recommend that the attempt should be made and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be willing to offer a substantial payment to that end:  even if this is rejected by the Ethiopians, the Somalis will see that we have been willingto make a sacrifice in order to secure their essential grazing rights.We understand that the Treasury, with whom our Departments havebeen in consultation, feel that the kind of sum which would have to be offered (probably a minimum of   5 millions) should not be paid andtherefore that no firm offer of a money payment should be made to the
Ethiopians.    We still feel, however, that a firm offer of this kind should be made and therefore ask that our colleagues should considerthe proposal.9.        In return for the cession of the territories we should beprepared to offer the Ethiopians not only a substantial cash payment(if our colleagues agree), supplemented if necessary by a gift ofmilitary and naval equipment;  but also the following undertakings:-(i)    To ensure in the Agreement registering the cessionthat the traditional grazing rights of Ethiopian Somalitribes in the territories and in the Protectorate wereguaranteed,  and would be entrenched in any instrumentconferring self-government on the Somalis of the protectorate;(ii)    to facilitate the opening of an Ethiopian Consultatein Hargeisa as soon as practicable;(iii)    to press to an early conclusion the Treaty of friendship and Commerce with Ethiopia already being considered;(iv)   To discuss the possibility of a further Treatyof Alliance.10,      The question arises whether we should also be prepared totell the Ethiopians that, if they will agree to the cession of the Haud,we will support, with the other parties concerned, the idea of their participation in any international arrangements which may be made inrelation to Somalia after the Italian withdrawal.     The Governor of the protectorate has advised in the strongest terms that , even if weconcluded a cession of the Haud, any attempt on our part to bx-ing the ethiopians into a consortium would have a devastating and irrevocableeffect on Somali opinion and bring about just all those consequences inthe Horn of Africa which it is our main object to avoid.    Accordinglyhis view, which is supported by the Colonial Office, is that this offercannot be made to the Ethiopians, even in return for a cession of theHaud.    The Foreign Office, on the other hand, consider that, if this offer is not made, such prospect as there might otherwise be of acession of the Haud will disappear;  and also that for us to sponsor any international arrangements for Somalia from which Somalia&apos;s closestneighbour is excluded, would have a disastrous effect on our relationswith Ethiopia, push her towards our enemies, and make her moreintransigent towards Somalia,,     This issue is therefore one on which wecannot make an agreed recommendation and would like to discuss withour colleagues.    If the Ethiopians are not prepared to agree to cession,the delegation should endeavour to secure from them a satisfactorychange in their interpretation and operation of the 1954 Agreement.If necessary, they should explore what inducements the Ethiopiansmight require for this purpose,  such as, for example, an offer of co-operation for the improvement of land-usage in Ethiopia.    our colleagues should know however that the Protectorate Government fore-sees great difficulty in conceding any of points (ii), (iii) and (iv).11.      Tn the meantime we propose mat we should examine with theUnited States, French, and Italian Governments the question of the futurof Somalia after the Italian withdrawal.    Although we would not commitHer Majesty&apos;s Government to any particular solution we might try outwith them the idea of an international consortium.S.L.23rd March, 1956. , A,L, -B,
