ImS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1956CONFIDENTIALCopy No.   53CP. (56) 656th March, 1956CABINETCHINA: PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATIONMemorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign affairs on 28th July, 1955, the Cabinet discussed an invitation which had been delivered by the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires from the Chinese Institute of ForeignAffairs for a Parliamentary delegation from the United Kingdom to pay a visit to china (CM. (56) 27th Conclusions, Minute 7). In accordance with the cabinet conclusions, the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires was informed that any officialinvitation of this kind should be made by the Chinese National People&apos;s congress and should be addressed to the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker. He was also told that, if such an invitation were received, although it might be accepted inprinciple, no early date could be fixed for the visit in view of the large numberof commitments to pay return visits to countries whose Parliaments had already sent delegations to the United Kingdom.2. On 24th September the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires delivered formalinvitations from the Chinese National People&apos;s Congress addressed to theLord Chancellor and the Speaker. In doing so he said that the ChineseGovernment would pay all the expenses only from the time the delegation reachedChina. The Lord Chancellor and the Speaker took the view that it would notbe possible to find a representative delegation, each of whom could find the returnair fare to Hong Kong (some  450); unless it was considered worthwhile to meetthe cost of transport from public funds it would be better to withdraw. On24th November an interim reply was sent to the Chinese on behalf of theLord Chancellor and the Speaker saying that because of the great distancesseparating the two countries many practical considerations would have to be examined before a positive reply could be sent. The Chinese Charge d&apos;Affairesexpressed disappointment at only receiving an interim reply. The Treasury were then consulted about whether the money for fares could be found from public funds. They did not see why Her Majesty&apos;s Government should pay anything since there appeared to be no significant political benefit for the United Kingdom.3. The question of cost has, however, continued to be raised. Possibly atthe promptings of certain M.Ps. who are anxious to visit China and despite hisearlier remarks that the Chinese Government would pay expenses only from thetime the delegation reached China, the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires appears recentlyto have told the Opposition Chief Whip that the Chinese would pay all fares from london to China and return. But even if the Chinese were prepared to pay allfares this would not save us any money since we should have to pay the full fares forthe return Chinese visit. Moreover, it is in principle undesirable that a delegation from Parliament should have to rely upon another Government especially a communist Government to pay their fares and it would be humiliating now toaccept a Chinese offer to pay.4. We can hardly delay a substantive reply to the Chinese much longer andit is for consideration what advice should now be given to the Lord chancellor and the Speaker.49674
5. The visit raises serious problems of timing. It would be difficult in any case to arrange it until the Summer recess. But a visit even in the summer will be opento serious objections, and it would be better if it could be postponed until 1957 atthe earliest. The factors involved are:  (a) A Parliamentary visit to China would be undesirable at the height of theUnited States election campaign.(b) The United States Government are much concerned at the chinese communist military build-up opposite Formosa and at their threatsto take Formosa by force if necessary. They could not fail to be critical of action on our part which carried the risk of being misinterpreted asapproval of Chinese policy.(c) The Chinese Communists would certainly represent the visit as a tribute to the achievements of the Communist regime and would derive muchpolitical advantage from it. It seems doubtful whether we should secure any compensating benefit.(d) It would increase our difficulties in encouraging inexperienced countries,e.g., the Sudan and Libya, to resist Chinese and other Communistblandishments.(e) The cost of air fares for a delegation of twelve, either for this visit or fora return visit by the Chinese, would be almost  6,000. There are otherways in which this money could be spent which would bring much better results in terms of good will to ourselves than an interchange of visits with China.(/) The Executive Committee of the International Parliamentary Union (I.P.U.)decided at New Delhi last November by 4 votes (including the castingvote of Lord Stansgate as International Chairman) to 3, with twoabsentees (U.S.A. and Finland), to recommend to the Council of theUnion that Communist China be admitted to membership. Thequestion is to be discussed by the Council at Dubrovnik in April.At last year&apos;s conference the United States Group threatened to leave the I.P.U. if Communist China were admitted. the outcome of the Council meeting must in any case be regarded asuncertain. From the British Group&apos;s point of view it might seemunwise to prejudice the Council &apos;s decision by acceptance of the invitation now to visit China.6. In view of these objections to a visit during this year it seems best simply to tell the Chinese that, while we are grateful to them for their invitation, we cannoton practical grounds arrange an early visit. I suggest that the Lord chancellor and the Speaker should be advised accordingly. It might be better if the replydid not refer specifically to previous commitments, since Members of Parliament,when they became aware of the terms of the reply, might signify their willingness to take part in special arrangements for this particular visit. In defending thedecision before Parliament, reference would be made to the high cost of aninterchange of Parliamentary visits with China.recommendation. I accordingly recommend to my colleagues that the Lord Chancellor andthe Speaker be advised to send a substantive reply now to the Chinese invitation to the effect that, while grateful for the invitation, they are on practical groundsunable to arrange an early visit.R.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5th March, 1956.
