S) -P) ,r,&amp;    i)secret.P. (56) 100 COPY NO.   ^17th April, 1956CABINETBRITISH GUIANAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will recollect that, in April 1953, the People&apos;sProgressive Party (P. P. P.) in British Guiana won the first General Electionunder universal adult suffrage and took office under a new constitution which gave wide powers to elected Ministers.    Within six months it was necessaryto suspend this constitution to prevent the subversion of Government by the extremist leaders of the Party.    A wholly official and nominated interim government was set up.2,      The Robertson Commission, appointed to enquire into these events,recommended an indefinite period of marking time in constitutional matters.I announced in November, 1954, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government accepted this recommendation but intended to do everything possible to fit the Colonyfor a return to representative Government.3.      Since the suspension of the constitution, efforts to improve conditionsin the Colony and develop its resources have been intensified.     Progress sofar has not been as good as was hoped but the ground has been prepared foxcarrying through the major programme of development recently announcedfor 1956/60.4.      In the political field, the most significant development has been asplit in the P. P. P.    One faction, led by Dr. Jagan, includes the extremeCommunist elements and derives its support mainly from East Indians in the sugar estates and country districts.    The other, led by Mr. Burnham, hasthe support of the African community and is stronger in the Georgetown and urban areas.     The Interim Government has not secured for itself any measure of popular support and its members, with few possible exceptions,have no political future.    A new political Party, called the National LabourFront and led by Mr. Lionel Luckhoo, the Mayor of Georgetown, has recentlybeen formed and may provide an effective focus for opposition to the extremist wing of the P. P. P.    It is, however, too early to be more definitethan this.5.      Against this background, the present Governor, Sir Patrick Renison,has since assuming duty last October considered the possibility of resumingconstitutional advance and as a first step he has relaxed restrictions on political meetings imposed under the Emergency Powers.    As a result,there has been a marked heightening in political interest and considerablespeculation about the prospects of elections being held.     The Governoris satisfied that he should maintain the initiative and has put forward proposals for a limited and closely safeguarded step toward the restorationof representative Government.    His proposals, briefly, are that an elected
element should be introduced into the Legislative Council and that he should appoint a number of elected members to serve on the Executive Council withportfolios.    Details of the proposed constitution are shown in the appendix to this paper.6.      These proposals represent the minimum advance which could possibly be made, if it is to be made at all, and there are safeguards at every point.The Governor believes that if this initiative is taken now it will be possible tohold the position at this level for a further period of years, whereas if the pressure for advance is left unsatisfied much longer the time will come when a much larger initial step will have to be conceded.    If these proposals are adopted I would in announcing them make it entirely clear that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are no more prepared now than in 1953 to tolerate a Communiststate in British Guiana, and that this is a controlled experiment, the success,or otherwise of which will depend on the Guianese people and the leaderswhom they choose to support.7.      I have discussed this matter very fully with the Governor.     There isno question of elections being held before April, 1957, and his intention is toleave the date open to give opportunity for a build up of the new national labour Front.    If this proves successful it will open up the possibility of an effective coalition of anti-Communist forces in which the Burnham faction ofthe P. P. P. might even join.    Nevertheless, the possibility that Dr. Jaganand Mr. Burnham, either in combination or separately, would succeed inwinning a majority of elected seats(and possibily all of them) must by no meansbe discounted.     I have discussed particularly with the Governor how theconstitution would be worked in that event,  since it would obviously beexpected that he would offer them appointment to Executive Council.    He is confident that the P. P. P. leaders could not again risk provoking a breakdown in the constitution without forfeiting their support in the country and it islikely therefore that they would prove co-operative if appointed to ExecutiveCouncil.     There is evidence suggesting that Dr. Jagan personally (as distinct from the convinced Communists in his group) is anxious to secure some political future for himself and is worried about the possibility ofdi s enf ranchi s em ent.8.      There is therefore a reasonable prospect of this experiment providing the basis for further progress in the political field in British Guiana.Provided it is clear that we intend to proceed cautiously with full safeguards against Communist extremism, I do not expect any serious loss of confidence in business circles.     At the worst, the constitution could revert to its present form at the discretion of the Governor;   and there will be a company ofUnited Kingdom troops in the Colony to safeguard against any disturbance.9.      Constitutional advance must sooner or later be resumed in british guiana and, whenever this is done, some risk must then be accepted.    I am satisfied that the Governor&apos;s proposal to retain the initiative and take a small ,,step forward at this stage is wise.    A further point in favour of this action is that until the elective system is restored in British Guiana there can beno possibility of the Colony joining the Caribbean Federation, as we all hopeit will.     I therefore hope that it will be agreed that I should make an annour.ce-ment in Parliament towards the end of this month.A. L. -B.Colonial Office, S.W.I.17th April, 1956.
