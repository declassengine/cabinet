POST OFFICE WAGES AND TARIFFSMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe pay increase of 5-g- per cent recently granted to the bulk ofcivil servants - together with a corresponding increase in the wages of post Office engineers and other increases in wages and costs since last autumn - have added  20 millions a year to the expenses of the PostOffice.2.      I intend to absorb as much of this as possible by increased efficiency and economy.    To this end some exhaustive examinations ofvarious aspects of Post Office organisation and staffing and of possiblenew forms of profitable business have been under weigh,  and comeare already beginning to yield results.     I am counting in what follows ona saving of  3 millions a year, though I hope this will prove an underestimate.    Taking such an economy into account, the Post Office needsan additional  15 millions in the present year.3.      Inevitably there arises the question as to whether the postage onthe ordinary letter should be raised from 2^-d. to 3d.     This would produce 6 millions this year.    Such an increase, plus an increase in the charge for the local telephone call from 2d. to 2-gd. , would produce nearly 11 millions of the  15 millions needed this year.     The rest could beraised by the various charges suggested below, but excluding an increasein the printed paper rate and in the night rates for trunk calls.4.      Nevertheless, my conclusion is that we should not now increasethe postage on the 2-1 d. letter, despite the fact that to refrain from taking this step means that more must be raised on the telephone side than is really due.     The proposed changes in postal and telephone rates can be defended on the grounds that we are tackling the services most clearly in deficit - whereas the ordinary letter at the 2-l-d. rate is still veryprofitable.5,      I think it important that the tariff changes should be announcedas quickly as possible if only to relate them to the big pay increaseschiefly responsible for them.     The changes I propose are at Annex A.I propose, if my colleagues agree, to reply to a Parliamentary Ouestionon Wednesday, 11th April, in the form set out in Annex B.CH.COPY NO.

ANNEX draft REPLY TO PARLIAMENTARY question the House will recall that on 31st March it was announced that animmediate general increase in the salaries and wages of civil servantswas being given in order to bring them into fair comparison with conditions in outside industry.     This, together with other increases in wages and costs since last autumn, has added  20 millions a year tothe expenses of running the Post Office.I am seeking to absorb as much of this increase as possible bygreater efficiency and economy.    I estimate that, after allowing forsuch saving, it will be necessary to raise an additional  15 millions this year to meet this bill.     If costs remain stable and with stricteconomy this will leave us with a prospective surplus of not more than 3 millions.The changes I propose to make are as follows:-TelephonesFrom 1st July, the subscribers&apos; fees for local calls will beincreased from 2d. to 2^-d. for the first unit, v/ith 5d. , 7-fd., and lOd.for the subsequent stages.    From 1st January next year the minimur1?fee for a call from a call office will be increased from 3d. to 4d.From 1st July this year the other call office fees will become 6d. , 9d.and Is. , and the charges for evening trunk calls will become generallyabout two-thirds of the day rate with a new maximum of 2s.    It is not proposed to increase telephone rentals or to reduce the 100 free calls for residential subscribers.PostalOn the postal side the minimum postage rate for printed papers and samples will be changed from 1-^d. for 2 ounces to 2d. for 4 ounces.The effect of this will be that printed papers weighing 2 ounces or lesswill be jd. more than at present, and printed papers v/eighing over2 ounces will be a 4d. less than at present.    For newspapers the rateper copy will be increased to 2d. for the first 6 ounces and then a Id. per6 ounces.     The registration service costs us far more than it yieldsand I propose to raise the minimum inland registration fee from 6d. to Is,and at the same time to double the maximum compensation paid for loss on letters sent at the basic fee, that is from   5 to  10.    The minimumfee from money orders will be raised to Is, with a consequential additionof 4d. on each subsequent step.     The poundage on postal orders will beraised by -id. on postal orders up to a Is. , and by a Id, on those between a Is. and 5s.     Corresponding to whatever increase is made in railway freight charges to the Post Office, there will be an increase in inlandparcel post charges.    No increase will be made in the ordinary letter and postcard rates.    Except possibly for parcels, the postal changes will take effect from 1st June.
