secret.P.(56) 8724th March, 1956.COAL, INVESTMENTMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power told my colleagues earlier this year (CM, (56) 8th Conclusions,Minute 9) that I was awaiting the submission by the National Coal Boardof a revised development programme for the industry.    I have now received the board&apos;s proposals.2.        New legislation to extend the Board&apos;s borrowing limit will benecessary to give effect to this programme^ as the present borrowing powers will be exhausted by the summer.    I have already obtained theagreement of the Home A3Eairs Committee to the introduction of a newBorrowing Powers Bill, and it is desirable that the Bill should have its second Reading early in May.3.        The purpose of this paper is to acquaintmy colleagues withthe general lines of the Board&apos;s proposals ai.^-  o ask them to agree thatthe Bill rhould increase iiie Board&apos;s borrowing powers by  350 millions.The Boards Development programme.        Investment, neglected in the past, has been one of the mostimportant tasks facing the Board since its inception.    It is estimatedthat the industry loses about four million tons of coal a year as seamconditions deteriorate, as distances underground lengthen,    and as numbersof faces, districts and pits reach the end of their working life.     investment is therefore necessary for three purposes - to maintain capacity, toincrease capacity and to mechanise.5,        It is clear new that the original &quot;Plan for Coal&quot; under-estimated the difficulties involved;  both the time and the money needed to sink newpits and carry out major reorganisations proved substantially greaterthan had been foreseen.    As a result effective investment has fallenbehind that contemplated and it is only in the last two or three years thatit can be said to have got under way.60        Despite the miscalculations and the inauspicious beginning theresults, when analysed, are not discouraging.     The major schemes of reconstruction so far completed have each led to a very marked improve-ment in performance.    Unfortunately the completed reconstructionschemes are few.     Of the  128 millions spent on major schemes since1947, schemes worth only  11 millions had been completed by the end of1955.    However pessimistically inclined one may be as a result of thepast, there is solid ground for believing that as more and more schemes are completed output will improve.COPY NO,CABINET
tU7.        The new programme is a revision of the original &quot;Plan for Coal&quot;and is designed to maintain and expand the investment begun under thefirst.    It envisages a capital expenditure during the next ten years ofapproximately  1, 000 millions, of which  600 millions is planned to be spent in the years 1956/60,    In addition  100 millions will be needed for a substantial new housing programme, for developments in smokelessfuel production and other contingencies.8. The results in terms of deep-mined output expected from thisinvestment are as follows:-Year Million Tonr1955 210I960 2181965 2301970 240I have been at great pains to impress on the Coal Board the importanceof not indulging in ever -optimism,    I believe there is a strong dispositionnow to be more realistic and I think these figures can be treated with reasonable confidence.9.        Assuming the realisation of the couve1 sion plan to oil, and themaintenance of opencast production at least at its present level(12 million tons per year; then achievement of these deep-mined outputforecasts should enable us to meet the inland demand for coal in theyears indicated, to ehminate coal imports and to increase coal exportssomewhat above their present level.10.      We certainly cannot hope to obtain outputs anything like thesewithout investment on fie scale indicated.    If investment were now broken off, not only would it be impossible to start new major schemes, but many of those already in progress would have to be abandoned.Productive capacity would fall by as much as 40 million tons in ten years.Much of the investment of the past six years would be wasted before ithad a chance to come to fruition.    When new capacity has been provided,the effective use of it must depend on management and men.    Butcapacity is the first requisite;   and in our present circumstances wehave no alternative but to make its provision possible.     The government must, of course, reserve the right to review the development programmefrom time to time in the light of circumstances.Financing the Programme11.      During the period 1956-60 the Board expect to contribute 300 millions from internal resources towards capital expenditure which may reach  700 millions.    They therefore estimate that borrowingsof up to  400 millions will be required in that period.    But they furtherestimate that after I960 capital expenditure will be fully covered bydepreciation provision from internal resources.    Thus borrowings of only  400 millions would suffice to cover the whole period from nowtill 1970.12. I have considered whether the Board ought to make a largercontribution from internal resources during the next five years and I have formed the opinion that it would be reasonable to expect them at least to overtake their existing deficit (about  40 millions), and create a smallworking balance (say  10 millions) and thus provide a further  50 millions,This would reduce the net borrowing requirements to  350 millions.
An extra contribution to capital of this kind can, however, only be foundout of increases in the price of coal, and if my colleagues agree that itis desirable I would propose to take a first step in this direction in thecoal price increase which will in any case be necessary later this year.13.      Further, there are good grounds for supporting the view(expressed by the Herbert Committee in relation to electricity) thatnationalised industries ought to make more generous depreciationprovision than they now do.    Should the Government in due coursedecide to urge such a policy on the nationalised industries generally and to support them in the necessary price increases, I do not think there would be any great difficulty in applying it to the coal industry.In the meantime, my proposal to increase the Board&apos;s borrowing powers by  350 millions is in no way inconsistent with the subsequentadoption of a policy of increased depreciation provision - the effect would simply be that the Government would not reed to make availableto the Board the whole of the  3 50 millions which it would be empoweredto provide under the Bill.    Again, of course, the additional funds wouldrequire increases in the price of coal.Conclusion14.      I invite my colleagues to agree that the Borrowing PowersBill should increase by  3 50 millions the upper limit of the advanceswhich, with the approval of the Treasury, I may make to the Boardtowards financing their revised development programme.An u.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.I.,23rd March, 1956.
