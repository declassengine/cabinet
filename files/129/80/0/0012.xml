(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government secret.(56) 626th March, 1956CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEW 1956Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the schedule of price guarantees and production grants set out inAppendix B of CP. (56) 56 and representing a total increase of about 17 millions has been put to the three Farmers&apos; Unions.    The Secretaryof State for Scotland and I have received representations on it from theUnion Presidents.    We have reported to the Ministerial Committee onthe Farm Price Review and we now seek the Cabinet&apos;s authority for our final proposals.The Unions&apos; Representations2.      The Unions have asked, much as we expected, for an increase ofabout  41 millions.     This is based on the net increase in costs of about 45 millions ( 37 millions for review commodities) and on the deterioration-tion in the farmer!s income compared with two or three years ago andwith earnings in other sectors of the community.3.      The Unions would like to aim at a net income of about  340 millions a year (on a normal-weather basis).     This compares with  320 millions in 1954/55 and  292 millions forecast for 1955/56.    The highest levelpreviously reached was  331 millions in 1952/53.recommendations.      After discussion on the Ministerial Committee we recommend thatwe should not go above an increase of about  22- 24 millions, although this seems practically certain to mean an imposed rather than an agreed settlement.5.      The Appendix gives :-(i) schedule authorised by the Cabinet on 28th February,(CM. (56) 17th Conclusions, Minute 10) - totalling 17 millions increase;(ii)    schule for the final determination -   21. 0 millionsincrease, to which I would like,  subject to theagreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to make a further addition on milk bringing thetotal to  24 millions.(iii)    Unions&apos; schedule -  41 millions increase.COPY NO,
6.      Milk is the most critical item.     The Unions attach the greatest importance to it and will centre their attack on this.   They are not likelyto agree to less than Id. increase.    A ^-d. a gallon is about as much asis warranted on strict economic grounds, but we shall be on much strongergrounds politically if an increase of ^-d. is given.7.      Pigs seem to come next in importance;   and if ^d. on milk cannotbe agreed but only fd., I would press very strongly for no change on pigsrather than the proposed reduction of 6d. per score - remembering thatmilk, pigs and eggs provide the small farmers&apos; main livelihood.0.      The other main difference lies in the Unions&apos; unwillingness toagree to the abolition, of the individual guarantees for fatstock.    We think we should insist on this.Confidence for the Future9.      It would have been useful if it had been possible to give an indicationin the Annual Review White Paper of our desire to find ways of providingassurances further ahead than one year.    The Ministerial committee thought, however, that it would not be wise to put anything into the white paper at this stage, seeing that we have no such schemes worked out,and that more detailed consideration should be given to these matters assoon as practicable.    I accept this decision as provident.Decision Required10.    We should like the Cabinet&apos;s authority to put to the Farmers&apos; Unionsthe Government^ final proposals as outlined above, subject to any minor amendments within the total that might seem to us to be desirable in thelight of any further representations from the Farmers&apos; Unions.D.H.
