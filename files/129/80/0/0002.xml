THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S government secret.P. (56) 5224th February, 1956BUR AIM memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Prime Minister and I discussed the Buraimi problem in washington on the lines laid down in my memorandum CP. (56) 9 and approved by the Cabinet on 11th January (CM. (56) 3rd Conclusions, MinuteWe explained to the President and Mr. Dulles why any return to arbitrationor negotiation about the sovereignty of the Oasis itself or about majormodifications to the frontier which we have declared would jeopardise ourposition in the area and destroy our influence with the independent rulers.The President and Mr. Dulles generally accepted these arguments.    Butthe President asked whether it was necessary for us to be completelyinflexible.     The Saudis were threatening to appeal to the Security Council,,If they did, it would be difficult for the United States to support us if wewere unable to suggest any alternative to arbitration.    If the United Statesdid not support some resolution;, either fox direct. negotia.tion or a resumption of arbitration, they would appear to be taking a stand againstthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means.    The President thereforewondered whether there was not some concession that we could offer inorder to get direct discussions going and so keep the matter out of theSecurity Council.    He observed that negotiations had broken down in 1935chiefly on the question of access to the sea for Saudi Arabia east of theQatar peninsula and suggested that we might consider some concession ofthis nature which would save King Sa.udTs face.     The Prime Minister saidthat he would look into this;  it might be one of the &quot;minor rectifications uwhich he had publicly stated we would be willing to consider.2.      The chances of reaching an agreed solution of the dispute by direct negotiations are remote since the Saudis are unlikely to renounce theBuraimi Oasis and we will certainly not do so.    But the King might wellagree to talks if he has reason to think that he can get something out ofthem which will save his face.    From our point of view the value of directdiscussions would be, first, that they might prevent the Saudis taking thismatter to the Security Council;   secondly, that, if this failed, we shouldbe able to show in the Security Council that we had exhausted every peaceful means of settling the dispute, thereby making it easier for the americans and others to support us;   and thirdly, that the Council would meet underthe shadow, not of a British abandonment of arbitration, but of a breakdown in bilateral talks.3.      While we were in Washington, King Saud made an informal approach to H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires in Jeddan    We sent an encouraging reply suggesting direct talks, and the Americans are supporting this.    But we have not of course mentioned to the Saudis any possibility of their obtaining access to the sea east of Qatar.COPY NOCABINET
40      It is possible that the Saudis will agree to direct talks without an advance assurance that we ars ready to modify our position in any way.If b of we shall have achieved a considerable success,     But even in that event it will almost certainly not be possible to sustain trie talks unless thePrime Minister^ offer of 26th October to discuss &quot;minor rectifications:1 ofthe frontier can be shown to contain the prospect of some real advantage tothe Saudis.     There are, it is true, a number of other matters which v/ecoxiid discuss, but none of these offers King Saud a means of saving hisface for the loss of Buraimi.    If a completely rigid attitude on our partprevents the opening of talks or causes them to break down immediatelythey begin, and if we are then arraigned before the Security Council, ourposition may not be comfortable.     The United States Government will feelthat we have ignored the Presidenfs recommendation and shown lack of understanding for their difficulties in Saudi Arabia.     They will be likely to feel that they must support a resolution calling for renewed negotiation oreven arbitration.    Such a resolution might be carried.5.      Access to the sea for the Saudis east of Qatar could be provided inone of three manners(a) by granting them special transitfacilities, particularly for oil,and a free port;(b) by setting up some kind of neutral zone;  or(c) by cession of territory.Needless to say (c) would be the most damaging from our point of view and we should not offer it.    The idea of a neutral zone presents practicaldifficulties, but it is a familiar conception in the area and has an inter-national flavour which would appeal to American and United Nationsopinion,,     Transit facilities and a free port would be much less objection-able but would probably not seem to King Saud much consolation forejection from Buraimi.    Nevertheless we could make some play withsuch an offer.6U      I do not overlook the objections to making any concession in this area.     The Ruler of Abu Dhabi has claims to this area which we have longrecognised.     The Chiefs of Staff, though they think that considered in isolation there would perhaps be no great military disadvantage in grantinga corridor to the sea to the Sav,.dis, think that the long-term military implications of any concession to the Saudis might be serious.     The oilinterest in the very small area concerned is unknown.    No oil has hitherto been found in Abu Dhabi and the Iraq Petroleum Company would like tomake test drillings in this sector.7.      Despite these objections, I think that it is extremely important to retain a measure of United States support in this affair;  with that inview I recommend that if necessary we should go as far as 5(a) or 5(b)above.     It would have to be understood that a concession of this kind would only become effective as part of a general settlement in which the Saudiclaim to Buraimi was abandoned and the frontiers of Muscat and Abu Dhabiagreed more or less upon the lines we have declared.Foreign Office, S.W.I.24th February, 1956.S 0 X.j a
