THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1956SECRET Copy No.  5 cp. (56) 727th March, 1956CABINETSOUTH-WEST africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State forForeign AffairsThe General Assembly of the United Nations has asked the International Courtof Justice for an Advisory Opinion on the admissibility of oral hearings ofpetitioners from South-West Africa. We invite our colleagues to consider whetherHer Majesty&apos;s Government should intervene before the Court to support the case against the admissibility of such hearings.2. Alone among the former mandated territories, South-West Africa was notplaced under United Nations trusteeship after the war because the Union of SouthAfrica, as mandatory power, refused to agree. The Union Government did,however, concede that South Africa was internationally accountable for South-WestAfrica, and dispute over the precise degree and the nature of this accountability hasbeen a constant source of friction, the United Nations pressing for closer supervision and the Union Government becoming less and less co-operative.3. The Court advised in 1950 that United Nations supervision of South-WestAfrica should not be greater than that exercised under the Mandates system andshould conform to it as far as possible. Since the South-West Africa Committee was set up in 1953 to discharge the responsibilities of the former Permanent mandates commission of the League continual dispute has arisen over its powers and procedure.4. At the last General Assembly there was disagreement on whether it was consistent with the Courfs ruling of 1950 for the South-West Africa Committee togrant oral hearings to petitioners from the territory. The Assembly decided to seek an Advisory Opinion on this point from the Court. The Annex to this paper givesdetails of the reference to the Court.5. United Nations procedure provides for hearings from trust territories butnot from non-self-governing territories. We have the strongest reasons forpreserving this clear distinction, in order to avoid the risk of increased united nations interference in our non-self-governing territories. South-West Africa,being a borderline case on its own, provides dangerous opportunities for blurringthis distinction. It is important that the Court should rule that oral hearings fromthis territory are not admissible. We are advised, and the Law Officers agree, thatthe Court ought on merit so to rule. But it is more likely to do so if we intervene to state the case against oral hearings and try to counter the anti-colonial bias ofa number of the judges. Moreover, intervention would maintain good relationswith South Africa at a delicate moment. The Union Government take the viewthat the United Nations has no jurisdiction and do not therefore intend to intervenethemselves, but would undoubtedly value our help. The only disadvantage of ourintervening is a risk of criticism, both at home and abroad, of any action whichmight be interpreted as support of the Union&apos;s racial policy. In 1950 His Majesty&apos;sGovernment considered this disadvantage as decisive and did not intervene.49682
6. The legal merits of the case and the arguments in favour of intervention inthe present, instance are set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Annex.7. The question now before the Court is one of interpretation of the 1950Opinion. We can intervene without implying either criticism or approval of theUnion Governments policy. There is a clear advantage to us in securing a rulingagainst oral hearings of petitioners. We think the balance of advantage thereforelies in intervening to support the case that oral hearings would be inconsistent withthe Courfs ruling of 1950. We invite our colleagues to agree.SvS&apos;2&apos;;f!      !K5f   ^fe^l^ 1,      &apos;.       &apos; % :&apos;. .       A. L.-B.V &apos;Hi       A i&amp;W 61$ &apos; &quot;   &quot; -     ;  R.6th March, 1956.annex the question of oral hearings of petitioners from South-West Africa wasconsidered at the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly inNovember last. The case in dispute concerned an application to be heard from anative of South-West Africa who was at the time resident in the United States.It was not possible to obtain agreement on this matter and the General Assemblydecided to refer the point to the International Court of Justice for a ruling.2.   The reference to the International Court reads:  &quot; The General Assembly .... requests the International Court ofJustice to give an Advisory Opinion on the following question: Is it consistentwiththe Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 11th of July,1950, for the Committee on South-West Africa established by general assembly Resolution .... to grant oral hearings to petitioners on matters relating to the Territory of South-West Africa? &quot;3. The Mandates Commission procedure contained no provision for oralhearings. When the question was considered by the Council of the League in 1927the decision was as follows :  &quot; The Council .... is of the opinion that there is no occasion to modify the procedure which has hitherto been followed .... on this question.&quot; in presenting the report on this question the Rapporteur said: &quot; if in anyparticular case the circumstances should show that it was impossible for allthe necessary information to be secured in this way the Council could, as theBelgian Government has indicated in its reply, decide on such exceptionalprocedure as might seem appropriate and necessary in the particular circumstances.&quot;There were no oral hearings by the Commission throughout the lifetime of theLeague.4. The Court has already expressed the view that United Nations supervision of South Africa&apos;s administration of South-West Africa should not exceed the supervision exercised formerly under the Mandates system and should &quot; conformas closely as possible &quot; to the procedure of the League Council. It is obviouslyquite possible for the United Nations to conform exactly to the Mandate procedure by not providing for oral hearings. The Court&apos;s opinion should therefore be aforegone conclusion. But of the fifteen judges of the International Court sevenor eight are likely to give an opinion in the opposite sense, on political grounds largely based on the anti-colonial policies of their native countries. If such an opinion secured a majority it would undoubtedly weaken our case in refusing to countenance oral petitions from non-self-governing territories. Conversely,an Opinion in favour of South Africa would assist us to a comparable degree.
5.   The arguments in favour of intervention are as follows: -(a) If we do not intervene the Court may not give the matter serious consideration at all and may permit itself to be side-tracked byirrelevant issues, e.g., whether South Africa&apos;s non-co-operation with theUnited Nations does or does not justify exceptional measures on thelines suggested by the Rapporteur in 1927 (paragraph 3 above). Itwill be difficult for the unbiassed judges of the Court to see that a sounddecision is taken unless we provide them with the raw material.(b) By not appearing we are likely to prejudice our position in regard to oralhearings from non-self-governing territories. There is no logical reasonfor extending the field of oral hearings to cover non-self-governingterritories. But although the position of South-West Africa is suigeneris, a wrong decision would make pressure for this likely. Thepolitical consequences would be serious, particularly in colonial territories which are approaching independence. In 1952 Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment decided that the United Kingdom Delegation would withdraw from the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly if thequestion of oral hearings from non-self-governing territories was pressed to a vote. (C. (52) 232 and C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions,Minute 7.)(c) In this case the Court is merely being asked to interpret a previous Opinion.There are no political issues directly involved.(d) Intervention by us would not involve taking sides in the dispute between india and South Africa or expressing any view on South African racialpolicy.6. The only difficulty which confronts us is the question of possibleParliamentary criticism, which may take the line that our attitude involved approvalof South African policies, and, in particular, showed unwillingness to allow thenative inhabitants to state their legitimate grievances in person. The ReverendMichael Scott is the force behind the attempt to get oral hearings admitted in theSouth-West Africa Committee. But we think that this risk must be accepted
