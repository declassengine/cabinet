(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS government secret. (56) 562Gth February, 1956FARM PRICE REVIEW 1956Memorandum by tlie Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and food the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review has consider eela report from officials on the discussions that have been taking place with thzFarmers1 Unions on the determinations to be made by the Government for the guarantees for livestock products for the year April, 1956 to March, 1957 ax-xfor crops of the 1957 harvest. A note of the main points arising from thediscussions is attached at Appendix A.2.      The Unions are expected to ask for an increase in the value of the guarantees of not less than  40 millions so as to cover the gross increasein costs.3.      The Ministerial Committee was, however, advised that the government-rneni should be able to defend a determination of the order of plus 20 millions, broadly on the grounds that the cost increases are of the same order as last year, net income is better on an actual basis (although loweron a normal weather basis), there are no exceptional circumstances suchas the weather last year to be taken into account on this occasion.    Anydetermination should therefore be expected to be appreciably below lastyear&apos;s plus  20 millions.4.      The Committee reached the following conclusions i-(i)  the Government1 s aim should be a change in the valueof the guarantees of about plus  20 millions;(ii)  as the next step, officials should be authorised to tablea schedule of changes adding up to plus  17 millions as shown in Appendix E;the items to be reserved for a final move from theplus  17 millions schedule to one of about 20 millions should be on milk and pigs, with small increases on sheep and potatoes, as alsoshown in Appendix B.    Milk and pigs are the itemswith which the Unions will be most concerned onbehalf of the smaller farmers;(iv) the Government should insist on the abolition of theindividual guarantee for fatstock, on new pigguarantee arrangements and on certain otheralterations in the basis of the guarantees.COPY NO,  iCABINET(iii)
(v)    a subsidy on silage was desirable, but there were serious practical difficulties and legislation wouldbe required.     This should be considered furtherfor possible introduction during the year if it proved feasible.5.      The expectation of officials is that any settlement at less than aboutplus  30 millions will have to be an imposed one.    The Committee feelthat it is important that an imposed settlement should be one that our own supporters will readily accept as a fair one.Decision Required6.      The Cabinet1 s agreement to these conclusions is sought, togetherwith covering authority for the plus  17 millions schedule to be given atonce to the Farmers1 Unions.    Final determinations will then be consideredby the Ministerial Committee in the light of the Unions&apos; comments on this schedule and subject to further consideration by the Cabinet.D.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food, S. W.l.27th February, 1956.
APPENDIX AOFFICIALS&apos; DISCUSSIONS WITH FARMERS&apos; UNIONSMAIN POINTS arising in relation to final determinations, the main factors to be taken intoaccount on this occasion are a cost increase of about  3 7 millions in respectof the commodities covered by the Review;   a slight rise in the actual net income of the industry forecast for 1955/56 as compared with the results ofthe bad weather year 1954/55 (from  285 millions to  299 millions), but a fall in net income when calculated on the basis of normal weather conditions(from  320 millions in 1954/55 to  292 millions in 1955/56);   and, on theother side, the continuing effects of the increasing efficiency of the industryand of the determinations at the last Annual Review, which will for instanceincrease the guarantees for crops from the coming harvest.2.      The official assessment is that, although the net income forecast for1955/56 is disappointing, the increase in costs should be offset substantiallyfrom the increasing efficiency and the continuing effects of the 1955 annual review.3.      The Unions are less optimistic, particularly about the offsettingeffect of increasing efficiency, in view of the way in which costs have been increasing.    But in any case they claim that the net income of the industryis too low to give a reasonable return, particularly for the smaller farmers.Moreover, they feel that the national situation requires a new expansion programme.    It is expected that the Unions will ask accordingly for increases at least to cover the gross increase in costs, that is not less than about  40 millions, and that they cannot be expected to accept less than 30 millions.4.      There are certain changes in the basis of some of the guarantees thatit would be desirable to make as well as changes in the value of the guarantees.     The most important are the abolition of the individual guarantefor fatstock (which were introduced on decontrol in 1954 to safeguardindividual producers against misfortunes in auction markets and are nolonger thought to be needed) and the introduction of simplified new guarantee arrangements for pigs0     The Unions are not prepared to agree to these changes, but are expecting the Government to impose them.

But in view of the need for legislation and the administra-tive obstacles that remain to be overcome, it is unlikely that payments against sucha subsidy which might be of the order of  2 millions a year can be made in 1956/57.
Notes on Alternatives for Final DeterminationsThere are two alternatives,, both, involving a smallerreduction on pigs than the minus Is. Od, included in the plus  17 millionsschedule and an increase in the guarantee for milk as against the&quot;no change&quot; in that schedule.These are:-Addition in value of Schedule  millionPige   -  9d. 0.milk  * -id. 4.45.2orPigs   -  6d. 1.6Milk  +  id. 2.23.0The second of these is to be preferred from the economicpoint of view, but the first may prove to be desirable on political grounds.Judgment should be reserved on this until the Farmers1 Unions&apos; reactionsare known.In addition there would be reserved:(a) a small further increase of 6d. a ton(about  100, 000) on potatoes, to help meet  .the expected complaint of the Unions abouta change in the basis of the guarantee wherebysub-standard potatoes would from 1957 be excluded from the scope of the guarantee;    and(b) a further increase of Jrd. a lb. ( 750,000) onsheep, to help secure a desirable reductionin the guarantee on wool.
