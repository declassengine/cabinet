(56) 98 COPY NO. J^J14th April, 1956.CABINETBAHRAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs this paper is on the political situation in Bahrain.    Annexedare extracts from two recent despatches from the Political Agent atBahrain, which deal more particularly with the position ofSir Charles Belgrave, the 3haikh&apos;s British Adviser.2. My colleagues will recall that there was a demonstration inBahrain when I called there on 2nd March and that the trouble flared up again more seriously nine days later.     Two companies of British troops were sent to the island but did not have to be used in quelling the disorders.The situation is now quiet but is basically unstable.3. The responsibilities of Her Majesty&apos;s Government are confined,broadly speaking, to defending Bahrain from external aggression andconducting the Ruler&apos;s foreign relations.    The administration of the Stateand the maintenance of order are the responsibility of the Ruler and hisGovernment.    There are normally no British troops on the islandthough a few technicians from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force are stationed in the small Naval base that we maintain there and on the airfield.The Shaikh of Bahrain rules autocratically and, under the guidance of hisBritish Adviser, Sir Charles Belgrave, he has administered his Statewisely and well,4. However, since 1954, a group of middle-class Bahrainis withfairly moderate views, calling themselves the High Executive Committeehave been agitating for a more liberal form of government.     Their demandsare, on the whole,  sensible and include a reform of the Ruler&apos;s Court,more representation of the people in the administration, and labour reforms.The Committee have a good deal of popular support and can bring outmost o  the workmen on strike.    They find it less easy to get them backagain.     The reform movement is not directed against the special positionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government but for some months now has demanded theremoval of Sir Charles Belgrave.    The latter is not a British Governmentservant but was appointed by and is responsible to the Ruler.5. The political difficulties of Bahrain are made more acute bythe religious conflict between the Sunni and Shia Muslim sects. Theyare about evenly divided but the Ruling family are Sunnis and the Shiasfeel, with some justification, that they are discriminated against.6. There is no evidence that the reform movement is directlysponsored by Egypt, but in the present state of the Middle East, Egypt islooked upon as the fount of progressive political ideas and the Bahrainileaders undoubtedly seek their inspiration there.    More recently the
(n el hjEgyptian radio has been broadcasting inflammatory propaganda aboutaffairs in Bahrain but this propaganda followed and did not inspire thedisorders.7. A further difficulty is the weakness of the Bahrain police andthe difficulty of strengthening them.    The reformists strongly oppose the introduction of reinforcements from Iraq but I hope that by bringing in small numbers of Iraqis unobtrusively and increasing the number ofBritish police officers, we shall be able to build up the Bahrain police to the point where they are adequate to control any outbreaks.8. The Rulerfs attitude to the reform movement is feudal.He regards even reasonable constitutional demands as tantamount torebellion and he is encouraged in this by his family.    Sir Charles Belgravetakes the same view.9. The disorders which began on 11th March were quelled after an agreement between the Ruler and the reformists which was negotiated by the Political Agent.    By this agreement the Ruler has gone some wayto meet the reformists1 demands but naturally he refused to considerthe dismissal of Sir Charles Belgrave.10. The reformists&apos; acceptance of this agreement is, however,certainly only a truce and it is against this background that we must consider our future policy.11. It is te   \pting to offer the Ruler our unqualified support, lethim act against the reformist leaders and bring in the Iraqi police with,if necessary, British armed help.    But I cannot recommend this course.It would be likely to lead to a popular rising in favour of reform and before long British troops would be shooting down people whose claimsare in accord with our own proclaimed beliefs and practices.    We could maintain control only by taking over Bahrain, which is legally independent,as a colony and holding its people down by force.    The effect on our friends,particularly the Americans, would be deplorable,  and the operation wouldbe a propaganda gift to the Egyptians and our other enemies.12. The alternative is to adopt a middle way, pushing the Ruler togo a little faster and the reformists a little more slowly along the pathof constitutional advance.    Admittedly our position in Bahrain depends upon our individual relation with the Ruler, and in allowing his personalpower to be weakened, we may also weaken our own position.   But if wedo not act in this way we may create greater difficulties for ourselves.It should be possible for us to support the Ruler and maintain hisconfidence in us while at the same time leading him to adopt gradualmeasures towards constitutional reform in order to conciliate popularotoinion and draw off from the ranks of his opponents men of moderateviews.13. The future of Sir Charles Belgrave is of great importance inall this.    He is still the focus for hostility against the Bahrain Governmentand indirectly against Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    Feeling against himis widespread and shared by many responsible citizens in Bahrain.    Hehas also lost the confidence of the majority of his British officials andis regarded as a liability by people in London with interests in the Gulf.The reformists have obviously only temporarily abandoned their efforts to oust him and this issue is more likely than any other to touch offanother crisis in Bahrain.    Three courses seem to be open to us:
ail tj(a) to leave him in his present position in the hopethat he may gradually divest himself of his functions and thereby cease to be the focus of criticism;(b) to risk another crisis in which he will be the centralfigure and in which we shall either have to get rid of him with great loss of prestige, or maintainhim in office with the certainty that the Bahrainiswill then turn their backs on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment;to choose our own tim.e for his retirement and take immediate measures to ensure the retentionof an Englishman in a key position with the Rulerand the Government of Bahrain.I rio not believe that, (a) is practicable, i.. e. that it will not in practisebecome merged with (b).    (b) means at best strikes, the interruption ofthe flow of oil and the humiliating spectacle of all the Ruler&apos;s police andall Her Majesty,s Governments armed forces failing to force oil workers to work.14.        I therefore favour course (c).    Subject to the views of mycolleagues I propose, as soon as it can conveniently be done, to seek tointroduce a British official as an assistant to Sir Charles Belgrave.    Theunderstanding would be that Sir Charles Belgrave would leave as soon asthe assistant had worked himself in, subject of course to conditions beingsuch that his departure could take place without undue loss of prestigeto him or to us.    This course seems to me to be the more indicated inthat both the Ruler and Sir Charles Belgrave are over 60.    It would bedesirable in any case to have a new man installed before a new Ruler succeeds.15. Finally, I think that our general line should be not to be tooafraid of intervening with advice in internal affairs (though our treatiesgive us no right to do so) and to seek, without antagonising the Ruler, to gain and keep the sympathy of moderate reformists in Bahrain.S..B.Foreign Office, S.W.I.,13th February, 1956.or    (c)annex extract from despatch No. 4 of 20th March, 1956,from Political Agent, Bahrain, to political resident, Persian GulfThe Adviser has therefore, in order to get things done,acquired the habit of exercising more executive authority than he shouldhave done and at the same time the Ruler has tended to shelter behind hisAdviser when unpleasant decisions had to be taken - making his excusealways that the Adviser had wanted it this or that way.    This in turn has brought the Adviser the reputation among the Bahrainis for being the real
ruler of Bahrain.    Moreover, in recent years the Adviser has found it more and more difficult, becuase of the increasing work of the Governmentto keep up with his work and things have more and more fallen into arrear.The ordinary routine dealings which this Agency has with him all take a quite excessively long time to achieve a result.    It is not thereforesurprising that the Belgrave System should have aroused oppositionamong the people who feel that nothing ever gets done and when it is done it is as often as not done in the wrong way.    Here the Ruler is as muchat fault as the Adviser for he fails completely to carry his family withhim by telling them what is going on and what his plans are, withoutnecessarily agreeing with their views.    They regard the Ruler as tooautocratic as the people do the Adviser.   Both the Ruler and his Adviserbecause of their.autocratic outlook completely fail to appreciate theneed for and the idea of public relations.    It is true that last summera Public Relations Department was set up with the Adviser&apos;s son,Mr. James Belgrave, in charge of it but the latter&apos;s activities have sofar consisted only in acting as general factotom to his father, in looking after visitors, foreign journalists and in running - not very well- the government&apos;s broadcasting station.    He has little comprehension of theneed to explain what the Government is doing to the people of Bahrain,and is certainly not encouraged in this by his father.Extract from despatch No. 5 of 22nd March,.1956, from Political Agency, Bahrain, to political Resident, Persian Gulf.t have already in my despatch No, 4 of 20th March spoken ofthe frustration felt by the people of Bahrain at the apparent lack of under -standing of their needs and wishes on the part of the Ruler andSir Charles Belgrave,    This frustration has largely stimulated the demandfor the latter&apos;s removal.     It is quite true to say that the Government ofBahrain is inept, lacks feeling and is slow of movement.     The Ruler has never at any time been compelled to stand on his own feet because theAdviser has always been here and the Adviser has never been compelledto adapt himself to changing conditions and move with the times because he has always had the Ruler behind him.    The two are the same age andhave acquired the same habit over the years of only seeing what they want to see.    As regards our policy in Bahrain I think we have reached a  .turning point.    It is no longer a question of whether we do or do not support the Adviser, Sir Charles Belgrave, because he is British andafter the Glubb episode in Jordan we do not want to see another keyBritish figure ejected.    It is a question of whether we can honestly saythat we still consider Sir Charles Belgrave to be the right man in theright place given the advance in political consciousness, not only inBahrain but in the whole Middle East and whether we should not be wiser,from the point of view of our long term policy, to set a new courseentirely which would inevitably entail dispensing with his services andcreating some new post or posts, if possible held by a British officialor officials to replace him.    This is the logical course but we shall haveto consider the effect of such a radical change on the Ruler who is neitherintelligent nor adaptable and is stubborn into the bargain.    He is alsovery attached to Sir Charles Belgrave whom we has known and with whom he has worked closely for thirty years - in effect a lifetime and is veryloyal to him.     When in 1948 your predecessor broached the subject of theAdviser&apos;s retirement the Ruler&apos;s reaction was such that the matter was dropped,    I think it might even be stronger now.    There is also thequestion of the Adviserfs own attitude.    He may not go willingly thoughit is possible that he will realise the uselessness of trying to go againstthe current.    As is so often the case, we are on the horns of a dilemma.
&amp;\3 zDSir Charles Belgrave, however much we may like 3iim personally, isnow an anachronism.    His continued presence will build up popularfeeling against us.    The maintenance of our position here and in the Gulftherefore demands a change, particularly if we are to seek to guideevents and not be dragged along by them.     The Ruler, however, will certainly take any such suggestions very ill and the British position inBahrain depends upon our agreements with him and his predecessors.
