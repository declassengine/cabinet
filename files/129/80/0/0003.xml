0 8(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)SECRETG.P,(56) 5325th February, 1956BRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum on thefinancial position of the British Transport Commission (C.M.(56) 16thConclusions, Minute 10).2.      This can be seen in better perspective against the followingbackground,3.      At the start of this year the Commission were faced with anaccumulated deficit of something over  70 millions,  substantial wage claims on behalf of practically all their staff, and a series of railwayaccidents which shook public confidence and brought the morale of railway-men, already severely strained, to a very low point.4.      On the wage claims the Commission were, in my view,  quiteright to settle quickly.    The figure was in any case within a few penceof what they would have had to agree anyhow after protracted argumentand arbitration.     Progress will not be made either in repairing theCommission^ finances or in increasing the efficiency of its undertakings,without a great improvement in human relations.    The commission by their quick settlement have created a new atmosphere and there arealready signs of better things.5.      For example the British Transport Productivity Council has now reached important decisions about work study and co-operation in the more efficient use of manpower and in new methods.    This is significant when one remembers the complete antagonism between the National Union of railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive: Engineerc and firemen (A.S, L. E., F.) a few months ago;  their co-operation in this, and anew willingness among railwaymen to work together, is no small thing.6.      Unfortunately it cannot produce dramatic results in a few weeks and for the present, taking into account the recent wages settlement, anda saving of perhaps  5 millions in expenditure by increased efficiencyarid productivity, the Commission in the current year will incur a deficit of some  55 millions if nothing more is done to increase both efficiency and revenue.     Taken together with what has already accumulated the deficit by the end of the year would be at least  125 millions on an annualturnover of some  700 millions.7.      The Commission^ proposals which I outlined to the Cabineton 22nd February are to increase both freight and passenger charges soas to bring in  37 millions more revenue a year.     This would still leaveCOPY NO.   ^ cabinet
sa deficit of   1 0 millions on the year&apos;s working to be added to the 70 millions already run up.    Of the  37 millions extra revenue, 24 millions would come from a general increase of 10 per cent in railway freight charges (with somewhat higher rates for smallconsignments) and about another  2 millions from somewhat lowerincreases in dock and canal and British Road Services freight charges.Some  9 millions would come from passenger fares inside and outsideof London and  2 millions in increases in rates for Post Office mails.All this is set out in more detail in Appendix 1.8.      The Commission need my authority only to increase railway,dock and canal freight charges ( 24.8 millions of the  37 millions they want).    For this I would have to make regulations under Section 02 of theTransport Act, 1947, after consulting the Permanent Members of theTransport Tribunal.9.     For the rest, the Commission already have powers to increaseordinary railway passenger fares (to 2d. a mile) and to raise excursionfares and certain sub-otandardfares (this would bring about  6 millionsall told).    They would have to make application to the Transport tribunal for authority to increase season ticket and early morning fares inside and outside of London, by which they seek another  1,5 millions.10.    There are three possible courses:-(a) to refuse the Commission^ application underSection 82 of the Transport Act, 1947 toincrease freight charges and to inform them at the same time that the Government would not wish them to increase further any other charges,passenger or freight and would, if necessary, beprepared to prevent it by a direction which wouldhave to be published.     This, in face of theirmounting deficit would be almost impossible to reconcile with the Commission^ statutory duty to make ends meet.(b) To reject the Commission^ application for a10 per cent increase in railway freight charges and to tell them that a similar application for a5 per cent increase wouldbe considered, and toallow them to make such increases in theirpassenger fares as wouldnot require freshapplication to the Transport Tribunal.     Thiswould reduce the Commission^ proposed increasein revenue by some  15 millions, and as eventhese modified increases could not conceivablybegin to operate until 1st April next theCommission would clearly run up a deficit ofabout  30 millions by the end of the year.This would bring their total deficit to about 110 millions.    It would be unrealistic to expect increased efficiency and the modernisationplan to overtake this deficit for some considerable time to come.(c) To allow the Commission to proceed with their proposals for fares and, subject to the advice ofthe Transport Tribunal, to authorise the proposed increase in freight charges and to make the bestpresentation of it that we can.
11.    The right course in my view in present circumstances, is 10(b).,namely not to allow the Commission to make all of the increases they propose.    I do not think that we shall ever get the maximum improvmentin efficiency if the Commission and their staffs believe they can alwayspass on their stea.dily increasing costs to trade and industry and the travelling public.    We can now apply this spur with some hope of getting a response.12.    If we take the course of action outlined in 10(b) above and if theCommission^ deficit is allowed to mount we shall have to apply a very wide interpretation of the words &quot;taking one year with another&quot; used in theTransport Act, 1947, with reference to the Commission^ duty to balancerevenue and expenditure.    But to enable them to carry a deficit of a fairly large order for a number of years until increased efficiency and therailway modernisation plan can take care of it is not necessarily unsoundcommercial practice.    The difficulty is to steer a course between a deficit that acts as a spur to enterprise and a deficit that, because ithas become too permanent a feature of the Commission^ finance, has abad psychological effect on management at all levels and thus ceases tobe in any way a deterrent to wage claims and indeed might work in the opposite direction.13.    I seek the authority of the Cabinet to proceed on the lines ofparagraph 10(b) above.H.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,W.I.,24th February, 1956.
