Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1956SECRET Copy No. 56CP. (56) 9613th April, 1956CABINETTHE CREDIT STANDING OF COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTBORROWERSNote by the Chancellor of the ExchequerEarly in the recent negotiations with the Indian Government about the ThirdSteel Works Mr. Deshmukh, the Minister of Finance, said that the Indians wishedto enter the London market at some appropriate time &quot; to raise such a loan asconditions in the market and India&apos;s credit standing permitted.&quot; From the pointof view of the sterling area and the Commonwealth this proposal was welcome tous, but we had to recognise that India does not possess trustee status, so that herprospects for raising money on the London market would be greatly reduced.2. We therefore informed the Indian Government that their desire to borrowin the London market raised the question of trustee status for their securities, andwarned them that this would raise problems for both countries. They were told that the problem was being examined urgently by the United Kingdom Government.3. The question of trustee status for securities to be issued by the indian government inevitably raises questions about the status of securities of other commonwealth countries that have severed the direct link with the Crown or may do so in future. The attached memorandum has, therefore, been prepared inagreement with the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office. Itrecommends the revision of the Colonial Stock Acts in order to take account of constitutional developments in the Commonwealth. It is proposed to do this by extending the present system to the stocks of the Government of India and to thoseof any other member of the Commonwealth which may in future sever its link with the Crown, subject, broadly, to conditions giving guarantees of stockholders&apos;rights equivalent to those now required by the Colonial Stock Acts. This proposal has wide implications and I therefore submit it to my colleagues for their approval.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,10th April, 1956.49794B
THE CREDIT STANDING OF COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTBORROWERSI. introduction. In connection with the negotiations with the Government of India overthe finance of the Third Steel Works, the Indian Finance Minister has expressed his Governments desire to borrow in the London market. This proposal, whichis welcome in principle, raises the issue of according trustee status to Indian stocks.We are advised by the Bank of England that trustee status is essential if India isto obtain adequate sums on acceptable terms. The examination of this problem has raised difficult issues which affect not only the other Governments of theCommonwealth whose stock now has trustee status, but also the position of pakistan and of Colonies such as the Gold Coast and Malaya, which are likely toobtain independence in the next few years. These issues are discussed in the present memorandum, and proposals, summarised in paragraph 15, are put forward forconsideration.II. History of the Colonial Stock Acts2. In the last century the stocks of Colonial Governments were not accordedtrustee status. The only overseas stocks included in the Trustee List* were thoseissued by the Secretary of State for India in Council and certain specified Indiansecurities guaranteed under statute. The other stocks on the List includedmortgages on land or other real property, stocks of the Bank of England, UnitedKingdom Government securities and those of certain other bodies and undertakings which were subject to statutory control.3. The stocks of Colonies were admitted to the List by the Colonial StockAct of 1900, provided that the borrowing Government had complied not only withthe general requirements as to Colonial stocks embodied in previous ColonialStock Acts, but also with special conditions to be laid down under the Act bythe Treasury. Three such conditions were set out in a Treasury Order of6th December, 1900, which is reproduced as Appendix I. Briefly, they were thatthe Colonial Government should first subject questions affecting the rights ofstockholders to the United Kingdom courts, secondly, should keep.in London fundssufficient to discharge any order of such courts and, thirdly, should formallyrecord its opinion that any legislation detrimental to the stockholders&apos; rights wouldproperly be disallowed.4. This remained the position until 1934. By that time it had been agreed,at the Conferences which led up to the Statute of Westminster, that the powerof disallowance in relation to the Dominions (Australia, Canada, New zealand and South Africa) should be regarded as having lapsed except in respect of thisquestion of trustee status; it was understood, however, that any of the Dominionswas free to abolish disallowance altogether, and in 1934 South Africa announcedher intention of doing so. She was anxious, however, to retain trustee status forher stock, and proposed an alternative to the third of the Treasury conditions thatshe should pass an Act to the effect that legislation affecting the rights of stockholderswould not be passed by her without the agreement of the United KingdomGovernment, and that any such legislation would if necessary be amended atthe request of the United Kingdom Government. This proposal was accepted inLondon and the formula proposed by South Africa was embodied in the ColonialStock Act, 1934 (reproduced in Appendix II). It should be noted that the newrequirement was made applicable to any Dominion, but only as an alternative tothe existing procedure; and it was stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at thetime, that the Governments of Australia and New Zealand had indicated a preference for continuing to follow the older procedure, though the new one would remain open to them.5. No further developments took place until the granting of independence to India and Ceylon. With the creation of the new States of India and Pakistan,the basis no longer existed upon which their stocks had previously been issued (bythe Secretary of State for India in Council).  At the same time it was not possible* The accepted description of the list of securities in which trustees are authorised by the trustee Act, 1925, S. 1 (1), and the Trusts (Scotland) Act, 1921, S. 10, to invest trust funds in their hands.49794
for them to proceed by way of the Colonial Stock Act, 1934, because it hadnot been extended to them. India has since become a republic, and Pakistan isabout to become one, and the Colonial Stock Acts could therefore not be extendedto them without amendment making them applicable to republican ^legislativeprocedures. Ceylon, however, retained the link with the Crown on becomingindependent, and trustee status for her stock was made available to her by bothprocedures: her Constitution (Section 39 of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order inCouncil, 1946) retains for a United Kingdom Secretary of State powers ofdisallowance in respect of legislation affecting the rights of stockholders, thusenabling Ceylon to retain trustee status under the old procedure; at the same timethe Ceylon Independence Act, 1947 (Second Schedule, 4th paragraph), extends theColonial Stock Act, 1934, to Ceylon, thus enabling her to use the new procedure.6. Commonwealth Governments which comply with the Colonial Stock Actsand thereby have trustee status are at present:(a) all Colonial Governments, with the exception of one or two small islandgovernments which have not hitherto raised public loans in London;(b) the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland;(c) the Governments of the independent members of the Commonwealth,other than India and Pakistan.Stocks with trustee status have been issued since the war by numerous colonial governments, and by the Governments of Australia, South Africa, New Zealand,the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Ceylon.7. Until 1900 the principle underlying the inclusion of securities in the trustee List was that Parliament, in enacting the List, recognised the credit standingof certain classes of borrowers. This has remained the general principle on whichsecurities have been included in the List. The Government, however, have hadno powers to do anything in respect of most securities on the List to ensure thatthe borrowers act in such a way as to preserve their credit standing. That has remained the responsibility of the borrowers themselves. It thus appears that theprinciple by which stocks have acquired trustee status under the Colonial StockAct, 1900, is somewhat different from the general principle of recognising creditstanding on which the inclusion of the other stocks has been based. The principleof the Colonial Stock Act, 1900, has been that the rights of stockholders shouldbe enforceable in the United Kingdom Courts and that the ultimate authority should be in the hands of Ministers responsible to Parliament. This principlecould be maintained only so long as it was clear that United Kingdom ministers and the United Kingdom Parliament had overriding authority over legislationoutside the United Kingdom.8. As soon, however, as the principle of the Act of 1900 was extended to independent governments in the Commonwealth, it would appear that this positionno longer obtained. By 1931, when the Statute of Westminster was enacted, thepower of disallowance had not been exercised for nearly 60 years in relation to governments which had become Dominions. The fact that the power was obsoletewas recognised in the Colonial Stock Act, 1934. In other words, the positionthen was that the independent governments could have legislated to the detriment of stockholders, and in practice the United Kingdom Government could not inthe last resort have prevented them. The 1934 Act only made this position moreapparent, since it is clear that any Dominion which passed an Act giving theundertaking required by the 1934 Act could repeal it without the consent of theUnited Kingdom Government. It appears, in fact, that the extension of the trustee List to the stocks of independent governments, whatever the procedure,necessarily involves a breaking away from the principle that as regards overseasissues carrying trustee status there must be a complete certainty that the rights ofstockholders will always be subject to the jurisdiction of United Kingdom Courts,and that the authority of United Kingdom Ministers and Parliament will always be paramount. The real security for lenders to independent commonwealth government rests on something different the conception that those Governments,although independent sovereign States, in practice conduct their relations with each other on a different basis from foreign Governments, and that in any case they have an overwhelming interest in not inflicting on their credit the damagethat would result from a breach of faith with their stockholders.
III. Policy Considerations9. The position we have now reached poses a dilemma between, on the onehand, the need to preserve the integrity of the Trustee List, and on the other theneed to enable all Commonwealth Governments to have equal opportunities forborrowing in London, subject to differences in their credit standing.10. The integrity of the Trustee List could be established absolutely only bystrict adherence to the principle that the borrowers whose stocks are on it are thosewho have achieved a credit standing entitling them to recognition by Parliament asborrowers to whom a trustee can lend i.e., that Parliaments function is to providerecognition, but not safeguards, nor in any way to underwrite the security. Adifferent principle has already been introduced by the Colonial Stock Acts, butwe should clearly start with a bias against any fundamental change in the presentsystem, for two reasons :  (1) because a change, by leading investors to examine the validity of thepresent basis more closely, might tend to bring the present system into disrepute. It would be difficult, for example, to answer the critic whoobserved that a number of the borrowing Governments have full powerto repeal their undertakings at any time;(2) because the market inevitably regards a decision to confer trustee status as an assurance from Parliament that the borrower is of good creditstanding, and this must involve some degree of moral responsibility on the part of the Government towards trustees. (The Trustee Listhas already lost some prestige as part of the general suspicion of the fixed interest securities. The Government for good reasons has resistedand is continuing to resist attempts (whether inspired by the NathanReport on Charitable Trusts or otherwise) to extend the Trustee list and change its character.) We must, however, guard against anyimplication that the inclusion of any particular stock in the list impliesany financial responsibility by the United Kingdom Government,though in this connection the history of the Newfoundland legislation has to be borne in mind as being the last instance of a CommonwealthTrustee borrower going into default. The effect of the 1933 legislation was to distinguish between Newfoundland^ Trustee issues which were continued and made a first charge on her finances as reconstituted with united Kingdom aid and her non-Trustee obligations which were ineffect paid off at a discount.11. On the other hand, the United Kingdom Government is committed toassisting sound economic development in the Commonwealth by the provisionof long-term finance from the United Kingdom, subject to the merits of eachproposal being closely examined, because the funds available from the UnitedKingdom for overseas investment are limited. Since in most commonwealth countries basic economic development is to a large and increasing extent in thehands of Governments, this means making capital available to Governments. (Itmust, however, be remembered that the supply of funds in the London market for oversea investment is limited and that therefore the merits of any proposalmust be closely examined.) Apart from special arrangements designed primarily for the Colonies, or to help to sell our exports under the Export Guarantees Acts,the policy has been that the Governments concerned should obtain such capitalas we can afford to let them have by borrowing from private investors in theLondon market rather than from the United Kingdom Government. This policy has many advantages. First, it avoids the burden that would otherwise fall onthe Exchequer. Secondly, it relieves the United Kingdom Government from theresponsibility for determining how much capital can be made available and sharingit fairly among the various claimants. Finally, by making the prospect of obtainingcapital dependent on the borrowing Governments&apos; credit standing among UnitedKingdom investors, it exercises a beneficial influence on the policies of those governments towards private investment generally.12. These considerations apply with particular force to India at the presenttime. She is embarking on a Second Five-Year Plan of economic development for which external capital will be required on a considerable scale. By reasonboth of our general policy as explained above, and of her historical connectionwith us, India will look to the United Kingdom first; if, however, that fails, she49794 B 3
will turn not only to the United States and Switzerland, but to the Soviet union and its satellites. It is recognised that we shall not be able to meet all her needs and that some other assistance, e.g., additional United States aid, will be necessary;but, if we can do nothing for her the consequences on our relations with her, and her attitude to the Commonwealth generally, would be disastrous. These generalarguments have been given particular force and urgency by the negotiations forthe financing of the third Indian steel works. It is important that this shouldbe built by British engineers as a counter to the first plant which is to be built by the Germans, and the second which the Russians are providing. The UnitedKingdom willingness to finance the third steel plant is regarded by the Indiansas a test case of the sincerity of United Kingdom professions that we wish toassist Indian economic development. The Indians have now agreed to buy aBritish steel plant costing some  50 millions, which will be financed partly by a united Kingdom Government credit of  15 millions, partly by United Kingdombankers&apos; credits of  1millions arranged by the United Kingdom manufacturers,and partly by drawings by India on her own sterling balances. The Indians hope to replenish their sterling funds at a later date from a London market loan andthus maintain the momentum of their second Five-Year Plan, and they have accepted our offer in respect of the steel plant in the expectation that they willbe able to do this.13. The Indian Finance Minister has been told that an important factoraffecting India&apos;s ability to raise money in London is the question of trustee status.He has been warned that this is a difficult question, requiring a lot of considerationboth here and in India; but pending a Ministerial decision we have not attempted to go into details with him, and have not passed on to him the advice we were givenby the Bank of England as to the effect of this factor on India&apos;s prospects. Thatadvice was that with trustee status the Government of India might be able to borrow  10 millions to  15 millions in 1956 at a rate of about 5 per cent., with a prospect of further loans to follow, but that without trustee status the likely amount would be  3 millions to  5 millions, and the rate about d\ per cent., while nothingwhatever could be said about future borrowing. (These estimates were made when Bank Rate was A\ per cent.; the rates might now be different and the amountswould certainly be made smaller; they illustrate, however, the difference madeby trustee status, and the great importance of the question in relation to India&apos;sprospects.)14. Although this issue arises most urgently in the case of India, it willprobably arise sooner or later in the case of Pakistan. The Government of Pakistanhas from time to time made enquiries about borrowing in London, and although their interest does not appear to be very active at present, they are in need ofcapital for their development programmes and may be expected to come forward with borrowing proposals when they judge the time is ripe. AnotherCommonwealth country likely to be affected is the Federation of Malaya. the exact form of constitution to be adopted when the Federation becomes fully self-governing has yet to be determined, but it is unlikely to include a direct link withthe Crown. The Government of the Federation, however, attaches considerable importance to the prospect of being able to borrow in the London market. Thesame problem would arise in respect of any other territory which, on obtainingfull self-government within the Commonwealth, adopted a form of constitution which did not include a direct link with the Crown.IV. Conclusions and Recommendations15. Given the considerations set out in the previous paragraphs, there appearto be four possible courses which might be followed:  (a) to abolish the Colonial Stock Acts system altogether;(b)- to leave matters where they are at present, thus excluding India, pakistan and any other member of the Commonwealth which might become a republic or sever its direct link with the Crown;(c) to find some new basis upon which members of the Commonwealth whichare excluded from the Colonial Stock Acts system might qualify fortrustee status;(d) to extend the present system to include India, Pakistan and any other commonwealth republics or countries which sever their direct link with the Crown, by modifying the form of the existing provisions,while retaining their substance.
16. The first course would follow logically from a belief that the only wayto maintain the integrity of the Trustee List would be to go back to the position that obtained before the Colonial Stock Act of 1900. But this would not be practical politics. Loss of trustee status would inflict great damage on the credit of all borrowers whose stock had formerly had it. It is hardly thinkable that weshould disturb the market and the investor and spoil the prospects of futureborrowing for all Commonwealth Governments by taking trustee status away from their outstanding loans.17. The second course would have the merit of leaving the market entirely-undisturbed. But it involves not only giving up any prospect of establishing with india and Pakistan (and any other territories which on attaining full self-government in the Commonwealth did not retain a direct link with the Crown) thefruitful relationship which could result from their becoming borrowers in theLondon market, but also accepting discrimination in this matter between differentmembers of the Commonwealth. It is difficult to see on what grounds it could be defended, other than that we regarded it as undesirable to extend the system to members of the Commonwealth which had severed their direct link with theCrown. This would involve the automatic exclusion of South African stocks ifSouth Africa became a country which had no direct link with the Crown and since it would not be open to us to argue that a republic was in any way moreindependent than a Dominion, the weakness of the existing safeguards would inany case be exposed. In short, we cannot avoid bringing out into the light of day the true basis of the existing provisions and risking whatever disturbance to themarket that may involve.18. The third course would be for us to enact legislation supplementing theColonial Stock Acts under which the obligations of a Commonwealth Governmentwhich was excluded from the existing system would qualify for trustee status if the borrowing Government improved the security for the service of its loan in london by special measures (earmarking of revenues, deposit of funds with trustees, &amp;c).This course would have the advantage of improving the terms on which theGovernment concerned would borrow, and so add to the tangible advantages of commonwealth membership. It would be less objectionable than other forms oflegislation to amend the Trustee List, since it would further the principle that whatParliament does is to recognise the credit standing of the borrower and not tosupport it. But any such amendment of the Colonial Stock Acts would cast doubt on the validity of the existing system. We would also have to face the difficultyof satisfactorily defining what supporting measures a borrowing Governmentshould take in order to qualify for Parliamentary recognition. It is one thing toleave the choice of such expedients to the discretion of the borrower inconsultation with his financial advisers who will tell him what the market expectsof him in his particular case. It would be far harder to draw up a list of measures for general application and to write them into an Act of Parliament. moreover the fact that such special measures were considered necessary at all would be takenin some market quarters at least as reflecting adversely on the borrower^ credit.In the case of India, they would certainly also be offensive to her amour propre;for this and the foregoing reasons, we do not recommend that this course shouldbe followed.19. Finally, we could amend the Colonial Stock Acts so as to extend thesystem to the stocks of the Government of India and to those of any other memberof the Commonwealth which might in future decide to sever its direct link with theCrown, subject to the same conditions as obtain now, the form of the thirdcondition being amended to make it applicable to the legislative procedure of sucha country. This would amount to offering India trustee status for her stocks if she would give guarantees of stockholders&apos; rights equivalent to those now required bythe Colonial Stocks Acts, e.g., by passing legislation accepting the jurisdiction ofUnited Kingdom courts in matters affecting stockholders&apos; rights, by satisfying theTreasury that sufficient funds were available in the United Kingdom to meet any order of a United Kingdom court, and by passing legislation embodying anundertaking not to pass legislation affecting the rights of stockholders without theconsent of the United Kingdom Government, and, if necessary, to amend such legislation at the request of that Government.20. This would amount to revising the Colonial Stock Acts again to take account of constitutional developments. It would carry further the process that we
began in 1934 when we recognised the lapse of the power of disallowance. Thisis the course we recommend. Although there is a possibility that it may lead to are-examination by the market of the whole basis of the Trustee List and result incriticism of its defects, we do not think that this is likely. It seems to us more likely that the market will accept it as natural that a member of the commonwealth should enjoy trustee status on a basis acceptable to them and to the UnitedKingdom Government. We recognise that a step which means that a memberof the Commonwealth which did not retain the direct link with the Crown wouldnot automatically lose trustee status might make it somewhat easier for Coloniesapproaching independence to opt for republican status. We think, however, thatthis is unlikely to be an important factor in such a decision and that in any case it must be accepted.21. It remains to be seen whether the Government of India will acceptproposals on the lines we recommend, and the first step is to obtain their reactions.There is no doubt that the conditions will be politically difficult for them to accept,and we ought to be ready to make modifications in form, e.g., by substituting sucha word as &quot; Commonwealth &quot; for the word &quot; Colonial &quot; in the Colonial StockActs. We may indeed have to consider other procedural changes. A settlement is in our interest as well as in that of India, because, if India could not borrow onthe London market, we should be under great pressure, for the sake of maintaining our good financial relations with her, to make capital available either byguaranteeing her borrowings in the London market or by making loans direct fromthe Exchequer. Moreover, the consequences would not stop at India; theintroduction of special arrangements to provide capital to her would undoubtedly be followed by similar request from other members of the Commonwealth. Atthe same time there are the strongest grounds for maintaining that the substance ofthe existing conditions under which the stocks of Commonwealth Governments canqualify for trustee status is essential, and for making the strongest possible efforts to persuade the Government of India to accept them.22.   We accordingly recommend:  (a) that the course described in paragraph 19 above be followed;(b) that authority be given for an approach to the Government of India with proposals on these lines.Treasury Chambers,20th March, 1956.
