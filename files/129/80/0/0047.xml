Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1956SECRETCopy No.56CP. (56) 9714th April, 1956CABINETSINGAPOREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in CP. (56) 85 I endeavoured to set out in a preliminary way the issuesconfronting us at the forthcoming Singapore talks, in advance of discussion withthe Governor and information about the exact proposals the delegation from singapore was likely to make.2. I have now discussed these matters with the Governor and have receivedfrom Mr. Marshall, the Chief Minister, a copy of the memorandum and a copyof the &quot; Heads of Agreement&quot; which he and his associates propose to submit tothe Conference. These are attached at Annexes A and B. The memorandumargues by comparisons with some of the smaller Member States of the united nations that Singapore cannot be denied independence on grounds of size: that independence will rally the people against Communism which under the present regime can masquerade as anti-Colonialism: and that Britain&apos;s strategic interestscan be safeguarded, and need be no obstacle to independence for Singapore. Tothose who wish to believe, it is a plausible document.3. The &quot; Heads of Agreement &quot; largely the work of Sir Ivor Jennings,Master of Trinity Hall, whom Marshall has appointed as his constitutional adviserfor these talks propose the complete sovereign independence of Singapore andpurport to include safeguards for United Kingdom interests within the structure of the independent Government by the establishment of a Defence Councilconsisting of four local representatives and four United Kingdom representatives,under the Chairmanship of the senior United Kingdom representative. TheChairman has no casting vote and in the event of parity of votes any proposal would be lost. The Singapore representatives therefore have a complete veto onall proceedings. This Defence Council is empowered to demarcate the areas withinwhich Commonwealth forces may be stationed, and may discuss any questions relating to the defence, external relations (other than trade and commerce) orinternal security of Singapore. The Government of Singapore may call uponthe Defence Council for assistance from the armed forces of the Commonwealthfor the maintenance or restoration of order, and such forces shall be placed atthe service of the Government of Singapore.4. Thus the demands to be made of us at these talks have at the last minuteemerged clearly. They amount to no less than independent sovereignty for singapore with a facade of consultation on external affairs, defence and internal security, without the retention of any executive power in United Kingdom hands.The United Kingdom Government are to be responsible for external defence and tobe allowed to maintain such forces as are necessary in Singapore for this purpose
&quot; until other arrangements are made by agreement between the Government of theUnited Kingdom and the Government of Singapore,&quot; though the United KingdomGovernment are to have only a limited and advisory influence on foreign policy.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are required to sign a blank cheque to place Britisharmed forces at the disposal of the Singapore Government for internal securitypurposes when that Government decide they need them.5. I have discussed these proposals with the Governor, who is now home.In sum, his view is that in setting Singapore on the road to self-government in1946 and by the concessions granted since then we have begun a process whichcannot now be halted. He considers that the forces of nationalism and&quot;anti-Colonialism &quot; alive in Asia and stimulated by the democratic processes wehave introduced into the Colony have now too great a hold on the mass of thepopulation to enable us to call a halt without the gravest consequences. He regardsMarshall, unstable and emotional as he is, as the only political leader in Singaporewho has a chance to rally popular support against Communism and who can meeton terms of ability and popular appeal the leaders of the extreme Left-wing groups.He believes that, under present conditions, in so far as there is any hope ofestablishing a firmly based democratic and anti-Communist elected Governmentin Singapore, it lies in backing Marshall, but he emphasises that this hope is a slimone at the best and that it must be regarded as a gamble. If the talks break downthere are likely to be very grave disorders and continuing turbulence which wouldrequire a repressive form of Government. He can restore order and maintain it with strong military aid (particularly if the loyalty of the Malay policemen andsoldiers remains steadfast) for about a year at any rate. During this period,however, he would expect a substantial dislocation of our base and port and tradingfacilities through strikes and possibly sabotage, although economic necessity wouldprobably force many people back to work after a period. More important, he holdsthat a breakdown on grounds which could be represented by our enemies as a refusal by Britain to live up to her promises of Colonial emancipation might forfeitgoodwill amongst the people of Singapore, and it would provide the well-organisedsubversive Communist elements there with a valuable weapon in playing onfrustrated nationalism and anti-Europeanism. This could mean that our chances of winning the minds of the people to our side in the war against Communism wouldbe completely lost. From the point of view of Singapore as a Colonial territorythere appears to be no constructive advantage in this position, and against thegeneral background of the East to-day, absolutely no political future.6. He therefore considers that we should go as far as possible to meet thepresent demands from Singapore. The majority of his advisers hold that theforces set loose in Singapore are so strong that we should in the last resort agreeto independence, if a reinforcement clause can be accepted and agreements aboutthe bases reached. The Governor agrees that this conclusion has the greatest possible force, if no more than local considerations are taken into account, becauseof the necessity of securing the goodwill of the Asian people; but he recognises that wider Commonwealth, free-world and strategic considerations may overridethe complete devolution of power at this stage, and that only Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment can decide whether they should do so. He is concerned that thedecision should be taken with full knowledge of the consequences which may follow a breakdown and that, if there is a breakdown, it should only come after we have demonstrated to the delegation, in a way which we can show to the world, our good faith in conceding early and very widely increased self-government withnomenclature marking a significant change from normal Crown Colony status.He emphasises, however, that further constitutional advances now, with the inevitable &quot; Malayanisation &quot; of the Police and Public Service which must follow,would make it increasingly difficult in practical terms for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to resume the direct government of the Colony at some time in thefuture: He considers that, grave as this risk is, it should be accepted in an endeavour to reach agreement at the Conference on the basis of a very advancedform of self-government.7. The Governor believes, none the less, that Marshall will not accept lessthan full internal self-government, with the trappings of independence and may wellnot accept anything short of independence itself. If he does not secure this, hehas publicly and frequently committed himself to resignation, and if he.carries out his promise, he will, in association with the extreme Left-wing leaders, be able to
bring about disorders and a political stalemate which would necessitate a suspension of the constitution the effects of which, as already indicated, offer no political futureor constructive adaptation to the changing conditions in the. East.8. The Governor has expressed his view specifically from a local standpointand in terms of Colonial policy, and within those limits I am bound to acknowledgetheir force. We cannot but recognise that over the last ten years Asian nationalismhas created such pressures that it would be idle to think we could control them at will. At the same time Her Majesty&apos;s Government have to take grave accountof the importance of Singapore as part of the defence- system of the free world andas the logistic base for Commonwealth troops in the Federation of Malaya. TheChiefs of Staff have set out their views clearly in D.C. (56) 8. They regardSingapore as indispensable as a naval, military and air base to the support of allied forces in the Far East. They are emphatically of the opinion that under no circumstances must Singapore be given its independence except possibly as amember of the Federation of Malaya. They consider that even if we remainedresponsible for external defence and had the right to bases in Singapore, under arrangements giving Singapore independence, we should have no more than papersafeguards and should be in Singapore only so long as it suited the Chinese. Theyconclude that we should aim at a policy of union with Malaya when both sides are ready for it, and until then give Singapore full powers of self-government &quot; otherthan internal self-government and the direction of prosecutions, defence, foreignaffairs, franchise and of nationality.&quot; They state that the transfer of control overinternal security should not take place until Singapore has adequate local forces to prevent a Communist takeover and to maintain law and order without outsideaid. (I shall refer later in this paper to the question where control over internal security at present lies.)9. Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom inSouth-East Asia, has expressed views which largely coincide with those set out bythe Chiefs of Staff. He, however, considers that, if there is to be a crisis, the price for its temporary postponement would be unacceptably high and that we should stand firm on what we regard as our minimum requirements in Singapore andaccept the consequences now before the policy of Malayanisation has denuded theadministration and the police of the European officers without whom a resumptionof power by Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be very difficult.10. Nor can we leave out of account the effects of any action we take in singapore on the Federation of Malaya. The agreements reached with therepresentatives of Malaya in January have left us with a notable combination of goodwill in Malaya and good prospects of the happy continuation of the british connection after Malaya achieves independence. I asked the High Commissionerfor his assessment of the effect in Malaya of the various decisions which mightemerge from our talks in Singapore. He considers that at present Malay opinion in the Federation is more solidly and strongly against any form of politicalassociation with Singapore in the immediate future than perhaps ever before.This is a combination of fears first, of Chinese numerical superiority endangeringMalay supremacy, second, that association may delay independence for theFederation, and third, the fear of the spread of Communism from Singapore.Since the London Conference, the stand of Tunku Abdul Rahman, the chief minister, against Communism has been much more outspoken than before andhas strengthened the already very strong anti-Communist outlook of the majorityof Malays. The High Commissioner agrees that the logical future of Singaporelies with the Federation but considers it illusory to assume that union with theFederation offers the prospect of political stability for Singapore or will necessarilysave her from the clutches of Communist China. Much would depend on theform any ultimate union between Singapore and the Federation took and in his view it is too early to say whether the balance of advantage will lie in favour of ultimate union or against it. He considers that if there were a break in Singaporethere would not necessarily be a violent reaction in the Federation, provided theleaders were satisfied that the break was temporary and was necessary to preventCommunism gaining control, and provided that it took place in such a way thatAsian face as such was saved. The Governor of Singapore has commented onthis assessment to the effect that, while he has sympathy with the Federation^problems, Singapore cannot be put aside just because it is an embarrassment. it remains our responsibility.
11. I have tried above to set out the main mines of thought of those who have,by reason of their office, to speak from a particular standpoint. I do not regardthese views as contradictory so much as illustrative of the different aspects of whatis a single and intractable problem. It seems to me that the first decision we must take is whether we could contemplate the grant of independence to Singaporewithin the framework now proposed by the Singapore delegation, provided wesecured better arrangements for safeguarding United Kingdom interests, andremoved some of the more objectionable provisions. A refusal may mean the breakdown of the Conference and the consequences which will flow therefrom.These are indeed serious. Singapore has all the elements of another &quot; Cyprus &quot;and a refusal could quickly lead to a &quot; Saigon &quot; situation in the Island with ourscattered defence facilities the targets for strikes and sabotage and our own people living behind barbed wire. Her Majesty&apos;s Government might well incur the odiumof the neighbouring Asian States and our future in Singapore would be gloomy.Communism will be at work in fertile soil under any repressive form ofgovernment, and will increase its hold proportionately with the length of directrule: so that a resumption of democratic government will become progressively more difficult.12. Despite these risks my own view is that we cannot at this stage concedecomplete independence. Not only have we a responsibility to ensure thatSingapore does not become a prey to the Communist advance in Asia, and to seethat its incomparable facilities are available for the defence of the free world butwe also have a responsibility towards Australia and New Zealand. South-east asia is the front line of their defence and I think we would have their support andthat of the Americans in refusing a complete handover, just as they and the americans would feel let down if we sought now to concede to Singaporean independent sovereign existence.13. I am equally convinced however that, if we are to refuse this demand, itis a matter of supreme importance that it is refused in a context which sets ourprinciples and policy in that favourable light which is their due. I consider thatwe should bend every effort to reach agreement with the delegation at some level which stops short of independence and I do not accept the contention that if we areto have a row we should have it and get it over. The sort of row that hangs over this Conference is not the row which can be got over, and if we are to have it then it must be so contrived that it does the least damage to our cause with world opinion generally, with middle-of-the-road opinion in this country and inparticular with opinion in Asian countries.. I consider therefore that we must goa long way in what we offer to the delegation so that if there is a break we canpublish what we were prepared to concede and secure the approval of the worldfor our liberality. Our proposals should also be such that, in the event of a breakin Singapore, we can state that our offer remains and thus encourage at least some sections of opinion in Singapore to accept the position, even if they will not rallyopenly to our cause.14. I must, however, at this point make clear the present position in regardto the control of internal security in the Colony. The present Constitution of singapore makes the Council of Ministers collectively responsible for the formulation of policy and the Governor can only act against their advice by theuse of his reserve power to override them which in the conditions of Singaporemeans an immediate constitutional crisis and the resignation of the Ministers.Internal security thus falls squarely within the collective responsibility of theCouncil of Ministers under the present Constitution and it is unrealistic to speak interms of &quot; handing over &quot; control of internal security. The advantage we enjoyin the present Constitution is that it provides that internal security (and defence and external affairs) must be in the hands of official Ministers and this means that the traditional police chain of command through the Chief Secretary to the Governoris retained and keeps the Governor in full day-to-day touch with the internal security situation. He has the tactical advantage of being able to concert privatelywith the Chief Secretary the handling of police matters in the Council of Ministers.In previous consideration of this problem it has not been fully recognised how farinternal security has in practice already become a matter for the Council ofMinisters collectively: we must recognise that nominal control has already to alarge extent been handed over although, because the Chief Secretary &quot;is the
responsible Minister in the Council of Ministers, the police are still attacked locallyas being the instrument of Colonialism.15. Inter-departmental discussion is still going on about the form of constitution which we might offer in place of &quot; independence.&quot; I would proposeto take the line at the Conference that Singapore cannot by its nature as acommercial city with no true natural resources be regarded as in the same categoryas the traditional Colonial territory moving towards self-government: that likeMalta it has special characteristics which call for special and unique treatment.The task of the Conference will be to work out some special and imaginativearrangements which will meet both the local desire for the independent conductof their own affairs, the strategic requirements of the free world, and the specialpart which Her Majesty&apos;s Government will still have to play in the affairs of singapore in defending it against Communist subversion. I have in mind a schemesomething on the following lines:  (i) Singapore would cease to be called a colony:  it would have a specialtitle, e.g., &quot; the State of Singapore &quot; or &quot; the Free City of Singapore.&quot;(ii) We might have to contemplate a change in the title of Governor (e.g.,possibly to that of High Commissioner).(iii) The ex officio members of the Assembly would be withdrawn.(iv) The number of elected members would be increased from twenty-fiveto fifty and the nominated members abolished.(v) The three ex officio Ministers (Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary,Attorney-General) would be withdrawn from the Council of ministers which would become fully elected, provided suitable arrangements were made to ensure the complete independence of the Attorney-General from local politics and the safeguarding of his responsibilityfor the initiation of prosecutions.(vi) The removal of the ex officio Ministers from the Council of Ministers(without which it is impossible for us to claim that we are offeringSingapore full internal self-government) brings us at once to thequestion of the control of internal security. I have already pointedout the degree to which internal security is in the hands of the presentCouncil of Ministers with its elected majority. I think, therefore, thatwe must be prepared to agree that police matters are transferred tothe portfolio of the Chief Minister and that we must establish somedifferent machinery which will secure to us the essentials of what wehave at present by way of control. I have in mind the establishmentof a separate &quot; Defence Council&quot; or &quot; Security Council&quot; under theGovernor, on which Ministers, a Deputy Governor (the present chief secretary), local Service Chiefs and the Commissioner of Police wouldsit and which would be responsible for discussing external affairs and defence where they affected the local Government, and the operationalaspects of internal security as a joint responsibility. The governor would have to have reserve powers enabling him to take command in internal security matters whenever he saw fit and to call in troops.Troops would only operate under his orders and at any time they were called in he would assume control of the police. The Commissioner ofPolice would have direct access at all times to the Governor in his capacity of Chairman of this Council and the Governor would beresponsible for senior police appointments until a genuinely independentPolice Service Commission with executive powers had been appointed.This is only an outline of the line I would like to follow and the exactform of the arrangements would depend on our negotiations.(vii) Some arrangements would be made to give local Ministers the right to conduct local negotiations on trade matters and to enable them to play a part in the external affairs of the territory.(viii) We may be pressed to accord the title of Prime Minister to the chief minister. I do not myself see that we could let the Conference breakdown on this point.16. Of all the Colonial conferences in recent times these forthcoming talksseem to offer the least possibility of preparing and agreeing a definite and preciseUnited Kingdom line beforehand. Much will depend on how far the Singaporedelegation remain united during the talks, and on actual negotiations over the
Conference table. Though I have indicated above the lines on which I would liketo work, I seek from my colleagues a very general authority to negotiate anagreement which has these essential characteristics (i) it does not concede complete independence, he., sovereignty;(ii) it goes as far as possible towards meeting the demands of the people of singapore, provided it leaves us in a position to resume effective controlif things go wrong.This is indeed going a long way and may even then not prevent a breakdown.It will, however, give us the best possible case to put to the world, it would help toavoid the complete sacrifice of local goodwill if properly presented, and it mighthold the position until the later coming together of Singapore and the Federation.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,13th April, 1956.
Annex AMEMORANDUM TO BE SUBMITTED  BY THE ALL-PARTYDELEGATION TO THE SINGAPORE constitutional conference, APRIL 1956Though the present Constitution of Singapore did not come into operation now 8th February, 1955, all parties are agreed that the aspirations of the peopleof Singapore cannot be met except by the attainment of full self-government within the Commonwealth as soon as the necessary constitutional changes can bebrought about. As in other Asian countries, Colonial status is considered to deprive the people of self-respect. On 25th July, 1955, the new LegislativeAssembly clearly affirmed its resolution that Colonialism be brought to a speedyend in Singapore. On 5th April, 1956, the Legislative Assembly passed thefollowing resolution: -That this Assembly affirms, in the name of the people of Singapore, itsbelief in the principle of &quot; the basic right of peoples to governments of theirown choice,&quot; as enunciated in the Washington Declaration signed bySir Anthony Eden, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and president eisenhower, President of the United States of America, on 1st February, 1956.;And its belief that the long-term welfare of Singapore lies in close and friendly co-operation with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealthterritories;Therefore the Assembly instructs its All-Party Delegation to theforthcoming Constitutional talks in London to seek forthwith for Singaporethe status of an independent territory within the Commonwealth, and tooffer an agreement between the United Kingdom Government and the singapore Government whereby the Government of the United kingdom would in respect of Singapore exercise control over external defence and giveguidance in foreign relations other than trade and commerce.Accordingly there can be no doubt that the present demand is in accordance withthe views of the people of Singapore.2. In a dynamic political situation, the inevitable impetus is towards full self-government. Experience has shown, too, that once a substantial measure ofself-government has been obtained full self-government must follow with greatrapidity. The people of Singapore and, probably, Her Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom also, have no desire to repeat the sense of frustation, the bad feeling and even disorder, which preceded the establishment of India and pakistan as independent countries. In Ceylon the grant of internal self-government was followed in a few months, even before the new Constitution had come into operation, by a decision to grant full independent status within theCommonwealth. In the Federation of Malaya the federal elections were not held until August 1955, and yet in March 1956 the Government of the UnitedKingdom agreed to make every effort to bring about full self-government and independence within the Commonwealth by 1st August, 1957. It cannot seriouslybe argued that the people of Singapore are less competent to govern themselvesthan the people of the mainland, that the danger to internal security is less inthe Federation (where active operations are still being conducted) than in theColony, or that financial stability is greater in the Federation (where the Reportof the Constitutional Conference recognises the need for financial assistance fromthe United Kingdom) than in Sinpagore (where no financial assistance is sought).3. The need for an immediate decision in favour of full self-governmentis at least as necessary in Singapore as it is in the Federation, because only suchan immediate constitutional advance can avert the threat that the forces of singapore which stand for a democratic way of life may be submerged by thosewhich overtly or covertly favour a totalitarian system. If the choice is betweenCommunism and democratic government the case for the latter is overwhelming.One cannot defend democracy by refusing it to those who are anxious to supportit. We have been taught to admire the British Constitution and British traditions of administration; Britain cannot now deny the implications of its .own lessons.
4. , Singapore is small in area, but it has a population of 1  millions. Thatpopulation is Larger than that of New Zealand when it became a member of theLeague of Nations and four times that of Newfoundland when the Statute of westminster gave it complete autonomy. There are at present seven states members of the United Nations with populations smaller than that of Singapore,namely, Costa Rica,&apos; Iceland, Jordan, Libya, Luxembourg, Nicaragua and Panama.It is only slightly smaller than the population of three other independent States,Honduras, the Lebanon and Paraguay. Since there are ten small countries withpopulations of less than \\ millions each, there can be no justification for sayingthat Singapore alone, among these ten, is incapable of becoming an independentcountry. The other nine are countries outside the Commonwealth; but member-ship of the Commonwealth is surely a reason for self-government, not a reasonfor refusing it. It is one of the advantages of membership of the Commonwealththat the independent nations composing it can, as the Prime Minister of Pakistanrecently remarked, assist each other freely, without implying any limitation ontheir sovereignty.5. British administration and enterprise have helped to make Singapore oneof the great commercial centres of the world. Its annual revenue is larger thanthat of Ceylon in 1945, when the Soulbury Commission recommended a constitution falling only slightly short of complete self-government. It is larger than the revenue of the Irish Free State in 1926, when the Balfour Declarationrecognised the complete autonomy of that country. It is twelve times the revenue of Newfoundland when it was decided to include that country in the Statute of westminster. Of the 70 States Members of the United Nations no less than16, including 9 of those mentioned in paragraph 4, have revenues smaller than thatof Singapore. Moreover, Singapore could balance its budget and provide thenecessary capital for further development without asking for assistance from theUnited Kingdom. If it agrees to remain within the Sterling Area it will do sobecause of the advantages of free interchangeability with one of the great currenciesof the world backed by Britain&apos;s commercial and industrial enterprise, and not because it lacks the resources to provide a sufficient reserve in gold or &quot; hard &quot;currency. It would contribute as much to the Sterling Area as the Sterling area would contribute to Singapore. ...6. Nor has the British administration neglected to pay attention to theeducation of the people. Singapore is not a country of undeveloped peoples usingprimitive languages. It shares in four at least of the great cultures of the world.In spite of the Japanese occupation it had in 1946 one of the highest literacy ratesin Asia. Under the Educational. White Paper of 1956 it is planned to providefree universal education on the basis of equal recognition and opportunity for thefour main cultures. This involves providing new schools for 18,000 children ayear until 1959 and 12,000 a year thereafter. Some 55 per cent, of pupils from present primary schools are promoted to academic and technical secondary schools.Plans for a Singapore polytechnic are already well advanced. The University of malaya is established in Singapore and has received liberal grants from the funds of the Colony. Recently, too, a second university has been established by privateenterprise in order to provide higher education for those educated in Chineseschools. These developments suggest that Singapore will be one of the firstcountries in Asia to achieve the standard of education of the more advancedcountries.7. These factors show that Singapore cannot be regarded as too small tobecome an independent State. It has both a larger population and a larger revenuethan six of the States Members of the United Nations, namely, Costa Rica, Iceland,Jordan, Libya, Nicaragua and Panama. Its educational standards are probablyhigher than those Of most States Members outside Europe and North America.The.standard of living, though low on European standards, is high on Asianstandards. Economically and financially Singapore stands upon its own feet, andit requires no more assistance from the larger and wealthier countries than India,Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma. It is unnecessary to comtemplate for Singaporethe sort of financial assistance which is to be provided for the Federation of Malayaunder the White Paper of 1956. The fact that its prosperity is dependent upon the stability of its political institutions makes an immediate and final decision aboutthose institutions essential. Not only the local population, but also the Britishand other overseas establishments in Singapore, would suffer severely if the present
unstable equilibrium were to be allowed to continue and opposition to the presentColonial Constitution allowed to develop.. 8. There is no doubt that Singapore could undertake its defence and theconduct of its external relations at least as well as any of the smaller states members of the United Nations. The offer of an agreement to enable the UnitedKingdom to control external defence and to provide guidance in external affairs is not due to any doubts about the capacity of the future Government of Singapore.The justification for the arrangement is that the Government of the UnitedKingdom, will need facilities for the fulfilment of its Commonwealth and international obligations. The fact that the United Kingdom would require such facilities and would bear the cost increases the argument for self-government.Far too many countries have to devote a large portion of their national income to defence installations, armaments and armed forces. Singapore will be able to devote the whole of its revenues to peaceful uses. Effectively, therefore, it willhave a larger revenue than many of the fifty-four States Members of the united nations whose revenues appear superficially to be larger. Because of its size,Singapore must be among the smaller nations; but financially and economicallyit will be one of the more stable of those smaller nations. To deny statehood to singapore on account of size would be to deny that one-third of the States Membersof the United Nations were entitled to statehood. Many of those nations were infact former colonies of European countries, whose efficiency and financial stabilitywere never brought up to the standards which Britain established in Singapore.In coming to London to end Colonial rule we seek only to fulfil and justify it by adding one more nation to the British Commonwealth of Nations.9. The fact that Britain needs assistance from Singapore in the performance of her Commonwealth and international obligations leads to another argument for self-government. It is surely the experience of the Western nations that theycan organise and operate bases only if they are placed among friendly peoples.It has been pointed out in the recent White Paper on Malta that no precise linecan be drawn between defence and external affairs, on the one hand, and internal administration on the other. It is obvious that armed forces require assistancein respect of roads, public works, telecommunications, essential services like water and electricity, sanitary precautions, police, and a hundred and one services ofthe civil administration. As the members of the Round Table Conference in Maltaput it: &quot; We recognise that the avoidance of friction under any constitutionalarrangement for Malta will always depend on the ready acceptance of defenceneeds, which include the needs of foreign forces and of N.A.T.O., and on goodwill and mutual trust between the two sides of government.&quot; Malta is asking for adifferent solution because its conditions are different and its need for assistance veryconsiderable. It is nevertheless true that the avoidance of friction under any constitutional arrangements for Singapore will always depend on the readyacceptance of defence needs, which include the needs of Commonwealth forces,and on goodwill and mutual trust between the two Governments. It needs noastrologer to forecast that, if the aspirations of the people of Singapore werefrustrated by the desire of the United Kingdom to retain control, there would be,to use English understatement, some shortage of goodwill and mutual trust. we accept the plea made by Ceylon in 1945, that mutual defence needs can be met only by mutual agreement. No people can be forced to help defend other countries,as every resistance movement from France to China, not to mention Malaya, has long since demonstrated.10. It is not the view of the Singapore delegation that the offer to vestdefence powers and some concurrent powers over external affairs implies anydiminution of Singapore&apos;s status. The agreement is offered for the mutual advantage of the two countries. Britain is being invited to defend Singaporebecause it needs to defend Singapore in its own interest and the interests of other commonwealth countries. The establishment of American bases in the UnitedKingdom is presumably designed for the defence of Britain as well as forthe defence of the United States but there has been no suggestion that Britain&apos;international status has been thereby diminished. Nor have British bases in Ceylonor the defence agreement between the United Kingdom and Ceylon preventedCeylon from being recognised as a fully independent nation within the Common-wealth or from being admitted to membership of the United Nations. We stateour views on this subject in order that it may not later be said that Singapore has accepted something less than full independent status.
.11. It is well known that Canada, Australia,, New Zealand, the Union ofSouth Africa and Newfoundland did not conduct separate external relations before1914, that they relied for external defence on the United Kingdom, and that canada and the Union of South Africa provided bases for the Royal Navy. Neverthelessthey were&apos;admitted to the League of Nations as fully self-governing States. Onlygradually did they assume complete responsibility for defence and external affairs,and indeed Newfoundland never did assume such responsibility. Moreover, from1921 to 1937 the-&apos;Irish Free State relied in fact, if not in theory, on being defendedby the United Kingdom and allowed the Royal Navy to maintain bases. Neverthe-less the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries, including theIrish Free State and Newfoundland, were declared in 1926 to be &quot; autonomouscommunities equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect oftheir domestic or external affairs.&quot; It was added in that same declaration that &quot; theprinciples of equality and similarity, appropriate to status, do not universally extend to function. Here we require something more than immitable dogmas. Forexample, to deal with questions of diplomacy and questions of defence, we requirealso flexible machinery machinery which can, from time to time, be adapted tothe changing circumstances of the world.&quot; So we claim that the United Kingdomand Singapore should be equal in status, but not that they should exercise exactlysimilar functions.12. The merit of the British Commonwealth of Nations is its flexibility. the term &quot; Dominion status &quot; has disappeared because it suggests a uniformity whichdoes not exist. India and Pakistan are not dominions of the Crown but republics.Eire was a republic in fact but not in form, and even now its relations with theUnited Kingdom are unusual. Newfoundland was a &quot; Dominion&quot; withoutundertaking its ov/n defence or external relations. Ceylon has agreements with theUnited Kingdom relating to defence and external affairs. The Federation of malaya will be a unique member of the Commonwealth, however its relations areformulated. Our purpose in citing these examples is not to lay down constitutionaldoctrines, but simply to suggest that there is room within this variegatedCommonwealth for an island State of 1  million people, having special relationswith the rest of the Commonwealth because of its fundamental strategic importance.13. Seeking, as advocates for a cause must do, what possible answers can bemade to Singapore&apos;s application for &quot; merdeka,&quot; we summarise the arguments andthe answers as follows:  (1) Singapore is too small we reply that it is larger in population and in revenue than six at least of the States Members of the United Nations.(2) Singapore is strategically important to the Commonwealth and must be under British control we admit the strategic importance and make proposals to meet the situation, but we deny that a continuation of colonial rule will enable Britain to make adequate use of that strategic position.(3) There is danger of Communist infiltration and subversion Communismis encouraged by Colonial rule because &quot; anti-Colonialism &quot; is madea Communist slogan and the issues become confused, as they werein Indo-China and the Federation of Malaya; &quot;merdeka&quot; will.rallythe majority of the people against Communism.(4) There is danger of disorder there has been disorder under British rule and there is likely to be more so long as the Communists can ride onthe &quot;merdeka&quot; bandwagon; while internal security must be underlocal control the delegation is prepared to consider proposals for safeguarding the security aspect of external defence establishments.14.
