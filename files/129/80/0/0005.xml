miS BOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1956CONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 5527th February, 1956CABINETBALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROSPECTSNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer should like to draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the attached report by officials on the balance of payments prospects.2.   The salient points in this report are that:  (a) In 1955, at a time when world economic conditions were all favourable to us, our balance of payments deteriorated very seriously. There wasa deficit on current account of about  100 millions. World economicconditions in 1956 are likely to be somewhat less favourable to usthan in 1955.(b) Before my announcement on 17th February of further economic measures,there was no clear evidence of any underlying improvement in theinternal situation. If in those circumstances, a deficit was seen to bedeveloping in 1956 of the same order as in 1955, confidence factorswould bring about a far greater deterioration and we would expecta crisis during the year.3. But, as my colleagues are aware, we must aim not merely to remedy the deficit in the balance of payments but also to., achieve a surplus of well over 200 millions on current account in order to meet our commitments on capital account. We have considerable actual and potential external commitments(outlined in CP (55) 184). We also need to rebuild the reserves to give us moreroom for manoeuvre in the future. Without a sufficient surplus, we shall be unableto meet our commitments to maintain our currency and our position as the centre of the sterling system or to retain our position as a world power.4. We have used up our time and the reserves are now low. We shall,therefore, need to watch closely the effect on the economy of the measures we havealready taken and be ready to take further quick action if they should proveinsufficient to bring about the deflation we need.5. The Economic Policy Committee, in considering these matters on22nd February (E.P. (56) 5th Meeting, Item 1), drew attention to two main points:  (a) In explaining the measures which we have taken, emphasis should be laid upon their positive object of diverting resources to the export traderather than upon the restrictive aspect of cutting down internal demand.(b) Public opinion should be further educated about the internal factors which create inflation. The Committee thought, as I reported to cabinet later on the same day, that it would be wise to bring up to date and to publish at an early date the White Paper on this subject. I shallbe submitting a revised draft to Cabinet shortly.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,25th February, 1956.49601Copy No. 4
IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   government confidential Copy No.   &amp;REPORT   OF   THE   COMMITTEE   ON   BALANCE   OF   PAYMENTSPROSPECTSSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS1955(i) World conditions were favourable for the United Kingdom balance ofpayments but we failed to take advantage of them.(ii) The volume of imports increased twice as fast as industrial productionlargely because of heavy marginal imports of finished steel, coal, plant and machinery, electrical equipment and other metal goods.(iii) While stocks in the economy as a whole increased during the year, this wasnot in itself a decisive factor in the level of imports.(iv) The deterioration between 1954 and 1955 was rather greater in the invisibleitems than in the visible items and some of this was due to &quot; once for all &quot; factors.(v) There were losses to the reserves during the year caused by breaks in confidence.(vi) The result for the year was a deficit on the United Kingdom current accountof about  100 millions and a fall in the reserves of  229 millions with a decrease in sterling liabilities to the non-sterling world of about  90 millions. The balance ofthe sterling area with the non-sterling world deteriorated with all regions thoughmainly with the dollar area and O.E.E.C.1956(a) The present position shows no clear sign of underlying improvement.(b) The prospects for 1956 on present trends are a further increase in imports(though much less than the increase in 1955) with a smaller increase in exports, andsome improvement in the invisibles.(c) All this would imply a deficit in 1956 of the same order of magnitude asthat in 1955 (about  100 millions on the United Kingdom current account) with no reduction in the deficit of the sterling area with the non-sterling world.(d) It is, however, clear that if this were seen to be happening the situation would become in fact very much worse through confidence factors and we could expect a position of great gravity by the summer or early autumn. We have usedup our time and run down the reserves and have now little room for manoeuvre.(e) It is clear that deflation is needed and needed quickly. Adequate andtimely action could make a material improvement in the 1956 position though wecould not expect to achieve this year the surplus in the current account which we need; in addition improved confidence might well lead to some increase in the reserves.TRENDS DURING 1955World Trends2. During the year there was continued rapid expansion in North Americaand, despite some credit restriction in certain countries, in Europe too. Theseconditions were favourable for the balance of payments of the sterling area as awhole; but we failed to take advantage of them.Conditions in the United Kingdom3. With an upsurge in capital expenditure superimposed on an alreadybuoyant level of consumers&apos; demand, the total strain on United Kingdom productivecapacity in 1955 was excessive. A severe shortage of labour prevailed throughoutthe year. After a period of comparative stability costs and prices of manufacturedgoods rose substantially during 1955, partly because prices of imported materials49601 b
rose, but mainly because incomes rose faster than productivity. During the yearexport prices of manufactures rose by 5 per cent.4. Part of our trouble was due to the concentration of demand on a singlesector of United Kingdom industry the metals and engineering industries. Herethere was a direct clash between the increase in investment demand for plant,machinery and vehicles, the increased consumer buying, and the increase in the exports of engineering goods. In these industries the shortage of labour was particularly severe and there were also shortages of certain kinds of steel despitelarge imports.5. Superimposed on the inflation of 1955 were rail, coal, and dock strikes.These caused some loss of output and disrupted the flow of exports, leading to some,though perhaps not much, total loss of sales; in the case of coal they added directly to imports.United Kingdom Exports6. Booming conditions at home reduced the incentive to sell abroad; they alsoreduced the power to compete. Output was diverted from export to the home market. In the result, at a time of considerable economic expansion in the world,particularly in Europe and the United States, there was a rise in exports of manufactures by the United Kingdom of only 7 per cent, between the first three quarters of 1954 and the same period of 1955 against an average for all the mainexporting countries of .1.2 per cent. Our competitors also experienced a greateconomic expansion but with less internal strain. Our poor export performance inCanada and O.E.E.C. markets was particularly striking.7. The increase in the value of exports over 1954 was 8^ per cent, of which1\ per cent, was an increase in volume. The Board of Trade estimate that, allowing for the distortions in the statistics due to the strikes, the increase in the volume of exports shipped from the United Kingdom between 1954 and 1955 was aboutA\ per cent, and that it may have been falling off somewhat in the second halfof 1955.United Kingdom Imports8. The increase in the volume of imports in 1955 over 1954 was 1 \ \ per cent. more than double the rise in industrial production. With an increase in import prices, the increase in value was 14 per cent, or  429 millions (see Table 1).9. Since early in 1955 food import prices have tended to fall, though therewas some check, partly for seasonal reasons, in the autumn. Import prices ofindustrial materials, on the other hand, which started to rise at the end of 1954,continued to do so during 1955, the outstanding features being the rise in copperand rubber prices of nearly a third.Table united Kingdom Imports by Commodity Groups, 1954-55  million, f.o.b.	1954	1955	Change from 1954 to 1955Food, drink and feeding-stuffs     ......

ifj10. There were heavy marginal imports of steel and coal. There were alsoincreases in the import of general plant and machinery, electrical equipment, othermetal goods and miscellaneous finished manufactures. These increases largelyreflected the inability of home output to meet the boom levels of investment and consumer demand and they accounted for nearly a third of the increase in value ofimports.11. Industrial materials other than steel and fuel accounted for about two-fifths of the increase in the value of imports. The increase in volume over1954 was nearly 9 per cent. rather more rapid than the output of industriesprocessing them. (The rise in output of manufacturing industry excluding food,drink and tobacco, was about 7 per cent.)12. Imports of food, drink and feedingstuffs accounted for about one-fifth ofthe increase in the value of imports. There was a large fall in Government stocksof cereals and feedingstuffs in 1954 and to maintain consumption in 1955 imports were  46 millions higher. The other main increases in food imports in 1955 werein meat and fruit and vegetables. The increase in the volume of food imports,excluding cereals and feedingstuffs, was 2 to 2\ per cent.United Kingdom Stocks13. For the most part, recorded stocks of imported commodities in privatehands rose moderately in 1955, although not enough to affect the large fall inGovernment trading stocks. There was an exceptionally large increase in stocksof timber, and imports under aid enabled tobacco stocks to rise substantially. Ifaccount is also taken of the substantial increases in stocks of coal and steel, whichmust in present circumstances be regarded as marginally imported commodities,total stocks of &quot; imported &quot; commodities rose slightly in volume during 1955 (theyhad fallen in 1954).14. Taking stocks in the widest sense, including stocks of manufacturedgoods and work in progress, the amount of stock-building in the economy as awhole during 1955 was probably rather more than proportionate to the rate ofgeneral expansion. This may have caused some part of the exceptional increasein demand for imports.United Kingdom Invisibles15. The trend so far described also affected net invisible receipts. Extraimports of coal from the United States and the higher volume of imports in generalcontributed to a sharp rise in freight rates and in payments for the hire of foreignshipping far exceeding any gain from increased earnings. The decrease in netshipping earnings between 1954 and 1955 was about  30 millions. The rise ininterest rates added to the interest paid on sterling balances about  30 millions in a full year. British tourists spent more abroad with the higher travel allowance and the higher level of personal incomes.16. In addition, there were special factors depressing invisibles in 1955.First, the net oil credit was exceptionally low, mainly because of back payments in respect of the higher revenues levied on the oil companies by the Governmentsof the Middle Eastern oil-producing countries and the initial costs of resumingoperations in Persia. Secondly, special dollar receipts were exceptionally low.While receipts of defence aid were tailing away, the flow of deliveries of items forHer Majesty&apos;s Forces under offshore procurement was held up by strikes and difficulties over specifications.United Kingdom Current Balance17. There was a deficit in the United Kingdom current account in 1955 ofover  100 millions, compared with a surplus of nearly  200 millions in 1954. just over half the deterioration in the United Kingdom current balance between 1954and 1955 was in invisibles, but a large part of this was for non-recurrent reasons.Price changes accounted for part of the worsening of the visible balance. Whereasbetween 1953 and 1954 import and export prices both fell by 1 per cent, between1954 and 1955 import prices rose by over 3 per cent, and export prices by 2 per cent.49601 b 2

On provisional figures, the R.S.A. non-sterling surplus was about thesame in 1955 as in 1954 ( 160 millions) but there was an improvement of  45millions with the United Kingdom and hence also in the overall balance. total exports from R.S.A. countries (including inter-R.S.A. trade) increased by some 300 millions between 1954 and 1955 (of which rubber and copper accounted for 150 millions). Most countries showed some improvement in their overall balanceof payments, though some had resort to credit restriction and import control. the worst period for the R.S.A. in the present cycle was the twelve months from mid-1954 to mid-1955, and more particularly the second half of 1954.The Capital Account and the Reserve19. In 1954 the sterling area had a surplus with the non-sterling world of 85 millions; in 1955 this fell to a deficit of  180 millions, a worsening therefor of about  265 millions. The change in the movement in the gold and dollar reserves was even greater they rose by  87 millions in 1954 and fell by  229millions in 1955, a difference of  316 millions. On the other hand, whereas in1954 there was a decrease of  32 millions, in sterling liabilities to the non-sterlingworld and the debit balance with E.P.U., in 1955 the decrease amounted to about 90 millions.20. According to provisional estimates the worsening of  265 millionsbetween 1954 and 1955 in the balance of the sterling area with the non-sterlingworld consisted of deterioration of  110 millions with the dollar area,  95 millionswith O.E.E.C. countries and  60 millions with other non-sterling countries.21. There were two breaks of confidence during 1955. The first, a minorone, in February was halted by the announcement of corrective action at the endof the month. The loss of reserves in February, however, amounted to  29millions and accounted for all the net loss in reserves incurred in the first half of1955. The second, and more serious, break came in the third quarter of the yearand was halted by the Chancellors statement at Istanbul that the government intended to maintain the value of the pound. In this quarter the reserve lossesapart from the E.P.U. settlement amounted to  82 millions; the gold lossattributable to E.P.U. deficits incurred in the quarter amounted to  62 millions.Although a large part of the loss in the reserves during 1955 is attributable to the underlying deficit of the sterling area with the non-sterling world, it was aggravated by losses due to lack of confidence.

November is seasonally a good month for exports and, in addition, there was inthat month possibly still some small element of benefit from the after-effects ofthe strikes.24. It is evident from these trade figures that the underlying position has notyet improved: the trade gap is still running at  70 to  75 millions, as it has been(allowing for the disturbance caused by the strikes) for the past year. Theimprovement in recent months in the reserves and in the rates for sterling nodoubt reflect some of the seasonal improvement in the R.S.A. position with thenon-sterling world and the restraint on imports imposed by some R.S.A. countries.They could also reflect some inflow of short-term capital, though such indicationsas we have do not suggest this.25. It would be dangerous to regard increases in the reserves and firmerrates as signs of greater stability unless they are accompanied by real improvementin the trade position.26.   It is evident that we face 1956 from a position of weakness.THE PROSPECTS FOR  195627. In view of the uncertainties and of the evident need for the intensification of the measures which have been taken an intensification whose effect could not possibly be measured in precise terms the Committee has not found it possibleto make quantitative forecasts for 1956.World Trends28. Some flattening out in activity in the United States during 1956 seems likely. On the one hand, this may be occurring already, in which case theAdministration, especially in an election year, may be expected to take steps whichmight lead to some recovery in the second part of the year. The alternative view is that some expansion will, continue in the first half of 1956, with perhaps someslowing up in the second half of the year; but that this slowing up would not amount to a recession. The effect on our balance of payments in 1956 would bemuch the same on either alternative. We also expect, notwithstanding monetarymeasures taken in some countries, continued expansion in Europe during 1956though at a slower rate than in 1955. We see no prospect, however, of muchgreater imports by primary producing countries.Internal Factors Affecting the United Kingdom Balance of Payments29. On present prospects the increase in home demand is likely to continuethis year. There are, perhaps, some signs that the various measures taken by theGovernment are having their effect the fall in bank deposits and advances, the short-term working in some parts of industry and the recent fall in Stock Exchangeprices may all be indicators of a change in the economic climate. But there is no real evidence that the pressure of demand has yet eased at all, apart from seasonalvariations in particular industries: the employment position is as tight as ever,prices and wages are still rising and, as shown above, the overflow of demand onto imports has not eased.30. Looking to the future, large increases in fixed investment are planned in both the public and private sectors of the economy; and the wage increasesnow under negotiation are likely to lead to a continuing increase in consumers&apos;expenditure. If these two major categories of demand continue to increase, wecannot expect much change in the rate of investment in stocks, though this is themost volatile element in demand. In total, therefore, it seems likely that unlessthe policy measures in force have much more effect than is evident now, home demand will again increase substantially and there will be no marked easing in the pressure on resources.United Kingdom Exports31. The continued increase in wages and prices contemplated above is boundto be reflected in the prices of our exports which, if the process continues, wilisooner or later become too high. We must recognise that apart from theimpediment to our export trade which our present internal position constitutes,
\there are other difficulties. World conditions for achieving a further increase inour exports will be less favourable than they were in 1955. Although our competitors will increasingly come up against the problems of full activity withwhich we have been faced and there should therefore be opportunity to improve our competitive position, there is likely to be less new export business to be foundin the world. We shall have to face stiff competition and fight hard. It takestime to develop new markets. The markets where the greatest expansion seems possible the dollar markets, Western Europe other than Scandinavia, the middle east and certain other non-sterling markets take only about two-fifths of our total exports. The need, therefore, to reduce the level of demand at home,including the demand for plant and machinery for investment, and to force ourexporters to fight hard abroad, is only too evident. On present trends we do notthink that receipts from exports and re-exports, which in 1955 amounted to 3,055 millions will be very much higher in 1956.*United Kingdom Imports32. In 1955 import payments amounted to nearly  3,400 millions, about 400 millions above the level in 1954. In 1956 it seems likely that, on presenttrends, the increase in imports will be greater, compared with 1955, than for exports, but considerably less than the increase in 1955, unless there was aspeculative movement into stocks. There would not appear to be any reason for much change in the rate of investment in stocks during 1956 unless there weredoubts about the willingness or the intention of the Government to deflate the economy adequately. Fears of other means of adjusting the balance of paymentsmight lead to heavy imports to forestall the possibility of scarcity and price increases. The increase in imports in 1956 should be more in line with theexpansion in production than in 1955, since it seems likely that there will be a fall in marginal imports of coal (partly at the expense of lower exports) and ofsteel (though this is less certain). Imports of timber should be lower owing to thehigh level of stocks and the check in the rate of house building.33. While food prices may well fall, it is much more difficult to form a viewabout the prices of industrial materials which will be influenced by changes in theUnited States economy; on balance we think that little change in import price as a whole is likely.United Kingdom Invisibles34. We expect these to improve in 1956 even if we get no further support forour troops in Germany. There should be a recovery in the net oil credit with thecompletion of the back payments to the Middle East countries. There should bea better net shipping figure because the general position will be helped by lowerimports of timber and coal. Finally, offshore sales, which were hampered by various hitches during 1955, should improve.The Rest of the Sterling Area35. The R.S.A. deficit with the United Kingdom seems unlikely to changemuch, nor is there much improvement during 1956 in the non-sterling surplus.There may be some increase in the volume of R.S.A. exports to the non-sterlingworld but we should not assume any improvement in prices. A rise in R.S.A. totalimports seems likely, mainly as a result of higher prices.The Balance for 195636. Taking ail this together it looks as if on present trends 1956 would show no improvement in the United Kingdom current account over 1955 when there wasa deficit of about  100 millions. We do not see signs of any material change in thenon-sterling position of the whole sterling area.37. If it were seen during the year that the United Kingdom was not doingbetter in 1956 than in 1955, additional factors would come into play. First,confidence abroad would be bound to be adversely affected if we were seen to be* Because the effect of the Dock Strike was to swell the export figure for the second half of 1955,export shipments (as opposed to receipts) for the first half of 1956 are likely to be lower than in theprevious half-year.
going through a second year of deficit due to inflation without taking adequatemeasures. Second, people at home would expect a change of policy and might makeheavy purchases to forestall future shortages. We would, therefore, expect that ifthe statistical position of 1955 were being repeated in 1956, these other factors would lead to the real position being very much worse. The deterioration would be tosome extent in the United Kingdom current account but above all in the changesin the reserves and sterling liabilities. In these circumstances, the position wouldbe very grave indeed by the summer or early autumn.38. It is quite clear that on present trends the position is far from goodenough. We now have little time in which to act. We took time during 1955 andran down the reserves in that year. Now it is vital to secure an improvement as quickly as possible. It is clear from this that further deflation is needed at theearliest possible moment. If informed opinion is that the policies of the Governmentare designed to meet the economic situation of the country the improved confidencecould quickly limit the risks to which we are at present exposed.39. Internal policies adequate to meet the situation would not be likely tohave much impact on exports in the first half of 1956 but if the level of home demandwere reduced we could hope to improve our export position from what it would otherwise be from about the middle of 1956 onwards.40. Timely action at home could, however, have a marked impact on imports during 1956. A sign of real deflation affecting the level of activity in the country during the year would have its impact both on imports for current consumption and on the stock position; although recorded stocks of raw materials and foodstuffsare not unduly high, stocks of manufactured goods and work in progress are substantial and could react quickly to a slowing down in activity.41. We do not think we can expect to restore in the course of 1956 to theUnited Kingdom current account the surplus we need but we do think that withtimely action we can make a good start on the road to recovery. And this recoverywould be accompanied by a return of confidence which could lead to some increasein the reserves during the year.13th February, 1956.
