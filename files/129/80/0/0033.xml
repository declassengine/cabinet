SECRETREVISED DRAFTMUST FULL EMPLOYMENT MEAN EVER-KISING PRICES?(A Popular version of the White Paper    &quot;The implications of Full Employment&quot;)The greatest economic problem in this country before the war was unemployment.    Since the end of the war all parties have agreed on the need.,  and the broad policies necessary to maintain full employment.    The policies hare been successful: unemployment,  on anything like the old scale, has not returned.   But in its placewe have had another problem;  rising prices.    It causes worry andanxiety.    It is also a serious danger to full employment itself.This booklet (and the White Paper on which it is based) are issued to help the country understand what the danger is and how it  canbe overcome.    It explains how we,_as a nation,    make prices riseand what we can do towards stopping that rise in the future.SECTION I:    HIGH EMPLOYMENT,  HIGH OUTPUT...Since the war, there has been enough work for nearlyeveryone in the country who wanted it.    With nearlyeveryone working we have each year turned out on average, 5 per cent&quot; more goods and services than inthe year before.    Such a rate of progress shouldsteadily bring to us more wealth and leisureThe Conquest of UnemploymentJust before the war over 10 per cent,  of the workers in thiscountry were unemployed.    Since 19U8,  the average has beenli per cent.    Very few people before the war believed it possibleto have so low a percentage of unemployment as this.. The number of people in jobs has gone up year by year since theend of the war.    So has tho average workers1s output.    With more people at work and with higher productivity, the whole country&apos;coutput7^ has risen by an average of 3 per cent,  a year./ This includes everything produced for money - services (thingslike bus rides and cinema shows and the work of the professions)as well as goods.
It is true that the standard of living of the man in the street has not gone up, over the post-war1 periodp  as fast as3 per cento a year,,    This was because other needs had first claim on the increase in our production,,    Exports, first:    we have hadto get a very big and rapid increase in the amount of goods weshipped abroad to pay for our imports.    Then,  in the factories,the machines which had gone on working throughout the war havehad to be replaced, and new factories, refineries and so on havehad to be builta    Thirdly,.after 1950 we had to rearm again,  .For all these reasons, although each year we increased outoutput, it was only in the last two or three years that a large part of the increase could go to improve the standard of living of the average home,Hopes for the FutureIf we can keep up a good rate of Increase in production inthe future we can look for a steady improvement in our standardof living.    The forms that improvement might take would dependpartly on our own personal choices: better food and clothes;more comfortable homes; longer and more interesting holidays.It would depend partly on the choices we made as a community -better schools, perhaps, and better roads.There are a number of reasons for being optimistic, and forthinking that over the years we shall be able to get an increasein production as big as or bigger than in the past.    There areplenty of new ideas for &quot;better machines, and for making machinesdo things they have never done &quot;before.    Firms are giving more attention than they did to finding ways of increasing productivity.And - although we shall certainly need all the coal we can producefor as far ahead as we can see - In the more distant future thereis the promise of atomic power.
Other Nations are ExpandingThat is not all.    It would &quot;be very difficult for us in thiscountry to go on producing and consuming more and more goods if other &quot;big industrial countries were not doing the same, for wedepend so much on world trade.    But nearly all the other &quot;bigindustrial nations are committed to full employment under theUnited Nations Charter and, like us, are looking to steady economic expansion.    They know much more now ahout haw &quot;best to get it andto avoid disastrous setbacks on the way.    There is much moreinternational economic co-operation than before the war.    Invarious international organisations36 the nations of the world meet and discuss their economic plans.   We are trying to expand our economy in a world which is going the same way: and that makes it easier.So it is reasonable to &quot;be optimistic.    Our problems are notthe problems of wrestling with economic depression, but of keepingeconomic prosperitySECTION II:    BUT PRICES GO ON RISING...But so far we have failed to find a way to prevent prices rising,Compared with the previous&quot; hundred years the rise since the war has be^n startling.   What explains most of the price increase isnot rising import prices or ,changes in taxes and subsidies:    itis costs of production at home.    Prices have risen mainly &quot;becauseincomes - wages and salaries and profits - have risen faster thanoutputAn Unprecedented RiseOn average the prices of the goods we &quot;buy have been highereach year than the year before,  sometimes a little higher,sometimes a lot.    A basket of goods which cost  1 ir: 19^6 cost about  1 10s.  in 1955.^Some people have now become so used to rising prices that theyassume it is in the natural order of things, that it has always____J___3___________x For instance, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.), the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.), theUnited Nations Economic and Social Council (E.C.0.S.0.C.)./ Throughout the white Papers the price index of all consumer goods and services is used.
happened.    This is not so.    The post-war rise in prices has beensomething quite unusual for Britain.    There are index numbers forshop prices - some official and some unofficial - going &quot;back to1850; and the figures are good enough to make it possible to drawone &quot;broad, general conclusion: from 19u7 to 1955 prices rose fasterthen in any other nine peace-time years in the last hundred.Why; it HappenedHow is this rise in prices of about 50 per cent,  to be explained?   Three different things have sent prices up, and we know roughly how important each has been.    Changes in indirecttaxes (purchase tax, petrol tax, etc. ) and in subsidies have had some direct effect on prices - but only a small one.    They onlyexplain about one-seventh of the   rise.     That is one influence.Import prices have risen, at times very fast indeed; but they onlyexplain about one-fifth of the rise.    That is the second influence.But the really big one is this: two thirds of the rise in pricehas happened because costs of production at home have gone up.What does this mean,  &quot;costs of production going up&quot;?    suppose the country produces 30 per cent, more goods, and that the peopleresponsible for turning out those goods - both the workers and employers - take between then 30 per cent, more money for producingthem.    Then, with 30 per cent, more goods and 30 per cent, more money, costs stay the same and prices are not driven up.    Butsuppose,  still turning out 30 per cent, more goods, they take90 per cent, more money for doing it,  then with 30 per cent, moregoods and 90 per cent, more money, the cost of producing each itemrises, and so do prices.This is what exactly happened in Britain between 1946 and1955.  .Between us, we produced 30 per cent, more goods and services and took 90 per cent, more money for producing them.That is the big reason why prices have reached a figure about half as high again as nine years ago.k
This happened for Britain as a whole because, all over thecountry, the same sort of thing was happening for individual industries and firms: wages, salaries and profits together were going up faster than output.Once&apos; the process has started, it tends to go on.    When incomesare&apos; rising faster than the output of the goods they are spent on,there is hound to he plenty of spending money about.    This keepssales &quot;booming.    And, when the next round of wage demands comes tohe settled, or profit margins come to he fixed, it is easy te passon the extra to the consumer.    This is why it helps to stop pricesrising if spending power is cut hack:  sales are not so easy, andfirms find it harder to pass on increases to consumers.Note that it is not any and every rise in incomes which sends i*pprices.  It is when Incomes rise faster,than output,.that^prices, riseThe Wrong LinkIncomes have risen faster than output because people have tried to link them to something else.    First, they tried to linkthem to the cost of living.    But there were times when the nationalstandard of living was hound to fall, for example, when import prices suddenly rose very fast, after the outbreak in Korea.    then we had to send more goods abroad and import less, and fewer goods were left for the home market.    There was no sound solution hut toaccept a temporary fall in the standard, of living.    Secondly;, whenincomes rose for one group of people,  there was a natural desireon the part of everyone else to keep up,  to preserve his relative position or differential.    Thirdly, people, especially in industry,have looked to see how well the other partner is doing, and, forinstance, have &quot;based a wage-claim on an increase in profits ordividends.    (The facts and figures ahout these are set out at theend. of this booklet.)   But however tempting it is to try to settle the amount of one s income &quot;by reference to the cost of living,  or towhat someone else is getting, if that method results in puttingincomes up &quot;by more than output,  it will drive up prices and thecost of living still further.
SECTION III.__WHY DOES IT MATTER,  IF PRICES RISE?,If prices go on rising, and the value of money goen onfalling,, i&quot;t leads to &quot;social urd^airness^ and all kinds ofeconomic -di^f jjt^t   s,&apos;. - Savings are&apos; disc our aged.___Some&quot;people get left &quot;behind In tne race to keep incomesji nstep&quot; with pricesi and it is noF the least deserving whoget left &quot;behind.   Most Important of all dust how, &quot;raniessprices in competing countries are rising&apos;jgJLftO?JLX^ll&quot;&quot;they are not&quot;) we are likely to lose export markets./   Ifwe do not sell enough exports. i?e -shall not&quot;&apos;be&quot;a^le topay for enough imports to keep our economic machine. -going; and our hopes of a rising standard7&quot;of Tfving will row less &quot;bright %   full erop 1 oymeht it fieIf will &quot;be&quot;threatenedInconvenient, Unfair. . .If prices rise, the value of money, of course, falls.    Anumber of evils spring from this.    To take the least of them first,it is inconvenient: housewives keep having to adjust their ideas of what is a &quot;fair price&quot; in the shops, telephone call boxes haveto be adjusted, new bus tickets printed, and so on.    But of coursethere is a great deal more to it than inconvenience.    There is the threat to savings.    If prices go on rising, in time people will be discouraged from saving; for, if they lend their monsy, they willnot know how much of it, in terms of what it will actually &quot;buy,they will eventually get hack.But if we are to have a go-ahead economy, we need a greatdeal of savings; for we need new factories, machines, roads, schoolshouses, and so on.   All this investment needs savings, and ifpeople are less willing to save it will be impossible to get enoughinvestment.Then there is the unfairness.    It is true that average earningshave more than kept pace with prices over the whole post-war period(though there were years when earnings fell behind): from 19I46 to1955* while prices rose &quot;by 10s.  in the  1, average earnings for wage earners employed in industry rose by 17s.  in the  1.   But theseare average earnings, and for industry only; in fact in the post-war period very many people have beer left &quot;behind.    The most obvioussufferer is the man who had saved up for his old age.    There are agreat many people like this, whose incomes either rise more slowlythan prices or do not rise at all.
i n i\1   &apos;iA Dig rise in the cost of living never leaves everything asit was &quot;before, even if average incomes have risen just as much.Some people gain without specially deserving to.    Others losethrough no fault of their own.    Rising prices make for nagginganxiety,  injustice, unrest and had feeling.ii2__and DangerousThe &quot;biggest argument of all, espcially just now, is the damage rising prices can do to our export trade.    All is not wellwith our trade and payments with the outside world: this shows upin the figures for the gold and dollar reserves.    They fell &quot;by nearly a quarter last year, and have only risen a little thisyear.    They are much too low.    The only good way out of the trouble is to increase our exports.Why are we not getting enough exports?    It is not that world markets for manufactured goods are shrinking: far from it.    world trade in manufactures has been rising fast in recent yearss and still is rising.    The trouble is that our share in this trade isfalling.    This table shows the shares which the three biggestexporting nations had in world markets for manufactures in 1937,1950, 1951 and the first nine months of 1955:Per cent,  shares in world trade in manufacturesQJLA&apos; ILK. W. Germany/1937          ......                         20 22                    231950         ......        ...           27 26                     71951         ...........         26 22                   101955 1st 9 months ......         25 20                   15/     All Germany in 1937-The United States share is a good deal bigger than it washefore the war.      The German   share has &quot;been rising very fast since1950.    Our share has come down.    Now it is smaller than it washefore the war - 2 per cent,  smaller - and six per cent,  less thanin 1950.    2 per cent,  of world trade in manufactures is worth some 2U0 million.    6 per cent,  is worth  720 million.
1 ^ &apos;tl1 6 there are a number of possible, reasons to explain why our share   has fallen since 1950.    Some German recovery was inevitable.We were handicapped by having to rearm after 1950.    Since 1950,markets in Europe, which is Germany?s main outlet, have grown morethan markets in the Commonwealth, which are our speciality.But these explanations cannot account for all of the fallin our share,    In fact, the same trouble which is at the root of rising prices.at home is also at the root of our failure to getenough exports abroad:    incomes hare risen faster than output0    Oneresult of it is this:    manufacturers have found it easy to selltheir goods on the home market, and so have not given enoughattention to selling them abroad.    Delayed deliveries matter toe- -and they are the direct result of the home market taking boo much.Then prices have risen.    Probably the biggest single reason whyexports are lost is because prices are too high.There is no direct evidence that our export prices are seriously out of line.    But the export prices of different countrieare difficult to compare.     There  is evidence that wage costs inthis country have risen faster than in the United States and west Germany.    If this goes on, our export prices are bound tobecome uncompetitive;   we shall find that we are not selling abroadenough to buy the imports we must have; and this could easily leadto rising unemployment and falling living standards.SECTION IV:_WHAT CAN BE DOMEPrice, rises can be checked if three things are done.___First,_ifthe Government helps to keep a balance between the supply ofgoods and the supply of spending money.__Second, if employersand workers together agree that nthe most.....important thing to dois to raise productivity.    Third, if all decisions about incomes -about wage-increases, profit-margins and dividend distribution -are made in the light of the lesson of the post-war years so far:that when the total cf cur incomes goes up faster than our outputprices are virtually certain to rise    &quot;Holding the balance the Government, by raising or lowering taxation, by making itharder or easier to borrow money, and in other ways, can alter theamount the nation has to spend.    It has to try to keep that amount
in balance with the supply of goods to spend it on.    If it seems that.there is not enough spending money to buy all the goods that can be supplied to the home market (while still leaving enough forexport), then it can,for example^ reduce taxation and so increasethe nation&apos;s spending.    If,  on the other hand, there is too muchspending money at home, then there is too much temptation to raise-prices, goods are taken away from the export markets, too manyimports are brought in,  and the Government must do something toreduce spending at home.    Of course, the Government will aim tokeep the amount of spending money high enough to make sure that employment stays high and production goes on rising.    But theGovernment is equally bo und. to make sure that the nation pays its way abroad.Rising OutputThe problem is that, with full employment and rising production,there is this tendency for costs to rise because incomes - wages and salaries and profits - rise faster than output.To bring them into line either the increase in output must bespeeded up, or the increase in incomes must be moderated, or both;the solution probably lies in a mixture of the two.First,  speeding up the increase in output;  or, higher productivity.    This demands enterprising management, ready to trynew methods and install new equipment.    Higher productivity needsworkers&apos; co-operation too,  of course.      Restrictive practices - therigid demarcation of duties, resistance to dilution or to the^reduction of manning scales, working arbitrary fixed stints - allthese practices grew up in times of heavy unemployment, and are outof place in a fully-employed economy.But there will only be full co-operation in raisingproductivity if there is confidence between management and workers on the shop floor0    Some firms can introduce new working methods,redeployment or a new system of payments without difficulty.    Others
meet opposition.    Some firms succeed in explaining their costs,their profits and future prospects to their employers.    Some do nottry.    Confidence between workers and employers will only come froma full and frank exchange of opinion and information at all levels in industry.Keeping Incomes in LineSecondly,  the rise in incomes must be kept in line with therise in output.    This is a rule for the country as a whole, not for each individual industry or firm.    Here are some points about it!(1)    In some industries productivity can be raised much faster than in others.    There may be more scope for new machines and new techniques.    In these industries where productivityrises fast, prices should be cut:    that will be the only way to keep prices stable for the country as a whole.Price   cuts are better than income increases as a wayof spreading the benefits of higher productivity.(2)    Firms should earn bhe extra profits they may need to finance new investment and expansion from bigger sales,not from higher profit margins.(3)    The Government obviously cannot give an opinion on any individual wage-demand, whether it  is  justified or not;wages are fixed by free negotiation between employees andTrade Unions.  . Nor can the Government give a view on eachdividend distribution.    It can only ask those concerned to keep the needs of the country as a whole in mind,  andto remember the experience of 19^6-55, when prices were driven up 50 per cent, mainly because incomes rose faster than output.
jL &amp; 0CONCLUSIONEveryone wants full employment, and everyone wants stableprices: but so far, we have succeeded in getting the first and wehave failed to get the second.    This booklet has set out toexplain, in the words of the White Paper, that &quot;How well off we areas a nation depends not on the money incomes we earn, hut on thesum total of the goods and services we produce;  and as individualsit is what we can buy with our pay rather than the pay Itselfwhich determines our standard of living ....... If we all pressconstantly for more money, regardless of how much.we produce to spend it on, prices are bound to go on rising.    But if weconcentrate on increasing productivity,  and on keeping costs down,price stability can be achieved along with full employment and arising standard of living^ Between us, we have been mainly responsible for sending prices up in *he past;  and between us, wecan do much to stop that rise in the future.s.58-56
WAGES, PROFITS,  AND DIVIDENDS:  THE FACTS/Before setting out the figures, here are some explanations.In what follows profits mean gross profits;    that is, profitsreckoned before tax is paid or any money put aside,  e.g. for the replacement of worn-out machines and buildings (called depreciation).These gross profits in fact are divided into four.   The largest-part is saved (this includes the money for replacement of building and plant); the next largest part goes   in  taxes;   third comedividends on preference and ordinary shares;  and last interest onloans etc.    The figures for wages and salaries (-that is, the moneyearned by all wage and salary earners)  and for dividends are allbefore deduction of personal income tax.1,     Wages and salaries are about three times as big as profits.*2.     From 1938 to 1955, wages and salaries rose 3i times.    GrossProfits rose       times,3.      But there:has been a big change in the way in which companiesdistribute  their profits.    In 1938, hi percent,  individends; in 1955 21 per cent.    Taxes and reserves are takingmuch more of companies&apos; profits than they did before the war.h.      So from 1938 to 1955, dividends rose about if times, comparedwith 3&apos;s times for wages and salaries,   (it was from 1938 to19U8 that dividends rose much less than wages and salaries.From 19^-8 to 1955 they both rose about the same amount.)5.      In real terms - in terms of what money will buy - wages and salaries (from 1938 to 1955) have increased about UO per. cent.Dividends have fallen about 30 per cent.6.      Dividends are about 5 per cent,  and wages and salaries about60 per cent,  of total incomes./ The full definitions of all the figures, and the sources,  are given&apos; in the White Paper itself.s This includes the gross trading profits of nationalised industries as well as those of companies.Excludes all the companies which have been nationalised since 1938.Otherwise the. figures would fluctuate up and down as companies were nationalised and denationalised.
