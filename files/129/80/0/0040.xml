9 Pi oht HI ej)(TK&amp;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT)i 1 confidential.P0(56) 9028th March, 1956CABINETTHE STRIKE AT CAMMELL LAIRD&apos;S SHIPYARD,BIRKENHEADMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and national ServiceMy colleagues may like to have the following information aboutthe strike at Cammell Laird!s Shipyard, Birkenhead.Last September, members of the Amalgamated Society of Wood-workers (A.S.W.) employed by Cammell Laird&apos;s went on strike as theresult of a dispute between that Society and the National Union of SheetMetal Workers and Braziers as to who should perform certain operations in connection with the insulation in aluminium of certain ships whichwere under construction there.     The strike was ended by two agree-ments reached on 21st October - one between the firm and the two unions and the other between the firm and the A. S. W. only.2.      In making this second agreement the firm undoubtedly acted mostunwisely.     The agreement allocated to members of the A. S.W. certainwork which had not been part of the original dispute but which was infact claimed by the members of a third Union - the Ship Constructorsand Shipwrights Association - which had not been consulted about theagreement.    The result was that the firm found themselves threatened with a strike whether they carried out the agreement or not.     they decided to abrogate the agreement and the National Executive of theA.S.W. ordered a strike of all their members in the Yard as from11th November,    The position still is that if the agreement werereinstated the other two Unions would strike.3.      Some 450 members of the A. S. W. are on strike.    About halfhave found other work although they would probably return toCammell Lairdrs if the strike ended.    Some thousands of other workerscould become redundant if the strike goes on and export orders to the yard might be cancelled or lost.COPY NO.4.      Since November every conceivable possibility of bringing thestrike to an end has been explored both by my Department and by theTrades Union Congress (T.UBC.).    All our efforts have broken down,however, on the continued insistence on the part of the A. S.W. - andparticularly its district officials - that the firm must reinstate theagreement.    It was hoped that the T.U. C. would be able to end thisinter-union dispute but when they failed I decided to set up a Committeeto enquire into the dispute and make recommendations.    I took theopportunity to express to the A.S. W. the strong hope that the strike would now be brought to an end but, although the National Executivemade a recommendation to this effect, it was rejected by a large majority at a meeting of the strikers.
2fh A5.      I have just received the Committee &apos;s report which stronglycondemns the action of the A. S.W. in calling the strike and recommends that work should be resumed and that the question as to who should dothe work in dispute should be settled through the established procedure.The report will be made public on 29th March, and I shall be making astatement about it that morning in reply to a Question in the&apos; House.I am attaching a copy of the Question and suggested Answer.6.      We cannot assume that the publication of the Committee&apos;s report will necessarily bring the strike to an end.    I am, however, once again urging the Society to get their members back to work and I shall make it clear in the House that I have done this.I.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.I.27th March, 1956.
ANNEXQUESTIONTo ask the Minister of Labour, if he can now make a statement on the trade dispute between the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers,the Ship Constructors and Shipwrights Association, and the Shipwrightsand Metal Workers Unions which has been outstanding in theCammell Laird Shipyards at Birkenhead for some months.SUGGESTED answer the strike at Cammell Laird&apos;s Shipyard which has been inprogress since last November threatens to affect the employment ofother workers in the Yard, and to result in the cancellation or loss of export orders.2.      For some months my Ministry and the T. U. C. have made everyeffort to bring this difficult dispute to an end.    When finally the efforts of the T. U. C. failed to secure agreement, I appointed, on the 12th March,a Committee to enquire into the difficulties which had arisen, and tomake recommendations.3.      The Committee has concluded its hearings and its report hasbeen published this morning.    It recommends that the question of whichcraftsmen should do the work in dispute should be settled through the established procedure and that there should be a resumption of workforthwith.4.      In bringing this report to the notice of the parties concerned, Ihave emphasised that a resumption of work is called for in the national interest, and I hope that this will now follow.
