9 fa (*COPY NO.STEEL AND THE RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES bill as matters stand, the Restrictive Practices Court will cover agree-ments made by the iron and steel industry in exactly the same way asagreements in other industries.2. The point at issue is that the Board of Trade maintain that this isthe only consistent and defensible course. The Treasury say that if thisis done, it means the end of steel denationalisation.3.      The argument centres on what is known as the Industry Fund.Put simply, this Fund, which is fed by contributions from all the steelproducers, finances among other things common purchases of rawmaterials, the costs of which are then adjusted.     If this arrangementwere brought to an end, companies which have access to favourablesources of supply would cease to pay in and would be better off, whilecompanies which are less favourably placed would have to pay more fortheir raw materials.confidential.P.(56) 9128th March, 1956CABINET&apos;   RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES BILL:  THE IRONAND STEEL BOARDNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe attached memorandum has been prepared by officials in orderto set out the questions at issue in deciding whether the restrictive practices Court is to cover agreements made by the iron and steelindustry.     The subject is to be considered by the Cabinet at their meetingon Thursday, 29th March, 1956 at 12 noon.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S. W. 1.28th March, 1956.
4.      There is no certainty that the Fund would be brought to an end bythe Restrictive Practices Court, but according to the advice given to theTreasury, the uncertainty created would in the meantime rule out the chance of a sale of the two remaining large steel companies still inGovernment hands.5.      The Board of Trade argument is -(i)    It is impossible to make an exception in the case ofsteel without opening the door to demands fromother quarters for similar preferential treatment.(ii)    The steel industry as a whole do not want to be exempted because they fear that exemption underthe new Bill might be the prelude to a demand forr enationali s ation.(iii) It cannot be certain that the two remaining giant steel companies - the Steel Company of Wales, andRichard Thomas and Baldwins - can be sold in thenext two or three years anyway because of thelarge expansion they are likely to have to under-take to meet the demand for steel sheet.(iv) It the Bill were modified to leave out steel and tobring it under a similar supervision by the Ironand Steel Board (which is now responsible for ageneral oversight of the industry) it would require legislation to give the Board much fuller powersof a quasi-judicial character than it has atpresent.    This would be resisted by the steelindustry.(v)    A prospectus for the sale of the two remainingcompanies would not simply state that the end ofthe Industry Fund would alter costs.    Any altera-tion in costs would be reflected in the pricestructure in order to maintain the profit margin of the companies.(vi)    The steel industry is at present liable to enquiry bythe Monopolies Commission.    If a purist line isto be followed this should have been referred toin past prospectuses for sales of steel companies.6.      The Treasury argument is -(a)    The equity of two-thirds of the industry has alreadybeen disposed of;  only these two giants remain.It will be difficult enough disposing of them becauseof their size and the contemplated expansion;   itwill be quite impossible (according to the advice of the Agency charged with disposals) as long as there is no certainty whether the Industry Fund is allowed to continue or not.
&amp; y o(b) The Industry Fund in question has hitherto beenblessed by the Government, and sales of companies have taken place up to now on the assumption thatit was likely to continue,    Indeedt City quartershave already raised the question of wherecompanies already denationalised stand.(c) It cannot be argued that the two remaining giantscould always be sold if the price were reduced.For one reason, if the sale were made at a lowerprice, and then the Industry Fund were later heldvalid, the jump in share prices might be such asto invite criticism and lead to a demand forrenationalisation.    For another, the uncertaintymight make City interests refuse to co-operate inthe attempt.(d) If the two big companies were left on our hands, theChairman of the Agency might well resign on theground that there was nothing further for him to do.(e) A statement in a prospectus that it would be open to companies to raise prices would have no effectunless either the Steel Board or the Board of Trademade a public announcement of how they would proceed in the matter of price control if the Funddisappeared.    In any case individual companies would be affected in different ways, and uncertaintywould remain.(f) No one has been frightened by the monopolies commission because it has always been assumed that the Industry Fund has the full support of the steel Board and the Board of Trade as successorsto the Ministry of Supply.7.      The Treasury argument may be summed up as being that we are faced with the alternative either of taking the Industry Fund out of thenew procedure, or of abandoning hope of any serious progress ondenationalisation till after the next Election.&apos;8.    The Board of Trade argument may be summed up as being that itis essential to the Restrictive Practices Bill that steel should be covered, and in any case doubtful whether its inclusion is a major factor in making denationalisation of the two companies impossible.27th March, 1956
