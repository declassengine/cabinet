(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET rC.P. (56) 75 COPY NO.12th March, 1956.CABINETCAPITAL FINANCE FOR NATIONALISED industries memorandum, by the Chancellor of the exchequer my predecessor and I have been increasingly concerned bydifficulties arising from the manner in which the capital requirementsof the nationalised industries, other than the National Coal Board, are met.    I seek the agreement of the Cabinet to include in the Finance Billprovisions to enable the Coal Board system to be applied to the otherboards instead of their present method of borrowing.2. The Coal Board borrows from the Exchequer and repays theExchequer by terminable annuities.     The other nationalised industriesborrow temporarily from the banks, and fund their debt by issues of stockin the market under Treasury guarantee.    In 1955 the amounts of stockissues by these industries was  387 millions.   The amount they expect to raise in 1956, subject to current overdraft limits, is  3 50 millions.3. The main difficulty of the present system is this.     The need to allow large overdrafts to the public boards puts the banks in an embarrassing position when they are reducing the accommodation extendedto private customers.    Moreover, the need to keep within such limits of overdraft as the banks set forces the boards to make stock issues,although markets at the time may be unfavourable.     These stocks haveto be taken up by the public Departments, which the Exchequer has to finance by adding to the floating debt - that is by the issue of treasury bills in the market.4. The main advantage of the change I propose lies in the avoidance of these forced stock issues financed really by Treasury bills.     Under my proposal, the Government floating debt will no longer be funded from timeto time at moments not entirely under our control by the creation of stock,financed by Treasury bills, and held by Departments, which then over-hangs and depresses the markets until it has been disposed of.    We shallhave the greater flexibility which lies in our being able to deal with fundingof floating debt by considering it as a whole and not being forced intopiecemeal transactions.     This should enable us to secure greater controlover the market and to create and maintain the firmness which we requireto deal efficiently with the large floating debt and the large earlymaturities of stock which we now have to face.5. Such a change must of course be considered in relation toGovernment policy generally.    In October last we took steps to divertthe borrowing of local authorities from the Exchequer to the stock andmortgage markets.     The present proposal looks on the face of itinconsistent with this.     But there are in fact important differences
between the two cases.     The marketing of local authorities issues ismore manageable.     The amounts are smaller and very diversified;   andas local authorities borrow on their own credit their issues arecommerically underwritten.6. Thenc again, Exchequer lending to the public boaids lookslike a contradiction of the proposal in the Herbert Report that the   :electricity authority should aim at raising new capital in the marketon its own credit.     The answer is that the Herbert objective is one whichmay in time be feasible for certain public authorities;  I do not by any means rule it out.    But under present conditions there is no practicalprospect of its being successfully adopted.7. My proposal has been agreed with the Ministers responsiblefor the nationalised industries concerned.    They in turn have informed in confidence the boards of those nationalised industries, and Iunderstand that the scheme is acceptable to them subject to the consider-ation of borrowing periods and similar details.0. Although my proposal is that the necessary provision shouldbe made in the Finance Bill, I should like to announce the new policyforthwith.     The announcement will have immediate effect in clearing themarket for such Government loan operations as may prove to be desirable and practicable.    Also, the nationalised industries and their bankers need to negotiate at once on the temporary financial arrangements that will berequired to cover the period after 31st March,  1956, when the presentguaranteed overdraft limits expire.9. I therefore ask my colleagues to authorise me to announceforthwith that Parliament will be asked to provide in the next Finance Billfor the provision of capital for the public boards from the Exchequer.I will agree the terms of the announcement with the Ministers responsiblefor the nationalised industries concerned, making it clear that this is atemporary measure and, in particular, that it is without prejudice tothe possibility at some future date of action on the lines recommended for the Central Electricity Authority by the Herbert Committee.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.-10th March, 1956.
