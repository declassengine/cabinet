1 i &quot;3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.Q56) 9916th April, 1956.CANCER OF THE LUNGMemorandum by the Minister of HealthTwo years ago the Cabinet authorised my predecessor to makea statement in the House of Commons on 12th February, 1954, onadvice he had received on the relationship between smoking and cancerof the lung.     (C.C.(54)   8th Conclusions, Minute 9).    Recently I havebeen pressed both within and without the House to bring that statementup to date.2.      Accordingly in a paper to the Home Affairs Committee(H.P.(56) 49) I set out the developments which have taken place duringthe past two years and a proposed reply to a Parliamentary Question.The Committee were in general agreement with my proposals butdecided that the matter was one which should go before the cabinet before any action was taken.     (H.P.(56) 9th Meeting, Item 5).3.      Briefly, the position is that my Standing Medical AdvisoryCommittee have, with the concurrence of the Central Health ServicesCouncil, now advised me that appropriate action should be taken as amatter of urgency constantly to inform the public of the known connection between smoking and cancer of the lung, and of the risks involved in heavy smoking.4.      Since the previous Statement:(a) Deaths from cancer of the lung have increased from15, 132 in 1953 to 17, 271 in 1955.(b) Papers published in other countries have confirmed the view that patients with lung cancer are lessoften non-smokers and more often heavy smokersthan patients with other diseases.(c) .Studies here and in the U.S.A. have shown thatmortality from lung cancer increases progressivelyfrom the group of non-smokers to the group of heavy-smokers (particularly of cigarettes, pipe smokingbeing less harmful) and that mortality is reducedby stopping smoking.    Results indicate that therelative mortality amongst non-smokers is 0.3 per thousand, whereas amongst heavy smokers it is. 1 per thousand.COPY NO.CABINET-1-
(d) Recently the authors of a large scale study in north Wales and Liverpool concluded that the elimination of cigarette smoking might reducethe male lung cancer death rates in the ruralarea of North Wales by over four-fifths and in liverpool by one-half, while elimination of some local factor in Liverpool (possibly atmosphericpollution) might reduce the rate there by a further three-eighths.(e) Two cancer producing substances have been identified in tobacco smoke (3 :4-benzpyrene andarsenious oxid^).     There is so far no evidencethat either produces cancer of the lung.     TheChairman of the Medical Research Council&apos;sCommittee on this subject has stated:-&quot;The fact that a causal agent has notyet been recognised should, in my opinion, notbe allowed to confuse the main issue, namely, thatthere is a statistical association between cigarettesmoking and the incidence of lung cancer which(again in my opinion) is so massive as to beincontrovertible;  and the simplest explanation ofwhich is that there is a causal connection betweenthe two&quot;.5.      I seek my colleagues&apos; approval to my giving a ParliamentaryAnswer on 30th April in the terms set out in the Appendix to this paper.R, H. T.Ministry of Health, W. 1. ,16th April, 1956.APPENDIXProposed Parliamentary Answer on TobaccoSmoking and Cancer of the LungI have been reviewing this subject in the light of the latestevidence available and of the advice of my advisory bodies;   and I wishat this stage to make a full statement of progress to bring matters upto date.2.      The House will recall that on 12th February, 1954, my predecessor, my Rt. Hon. Friend the Minister of Labour and NationalService, made a statement which indicated that the statistical evidencepointed to a presumption of a causal relationship between smoking andlung cancer, and also to other factors such as atmospheric pollution;but that no causal connection had been scientifically established andthat more research was needed.
i-fi iS nJ \fw d O3.      The position to-day is that further statistical evidence in this and other countries has strengthened the presumption that smoking,and particularly the heavy smoking of cigarettes, is an important factor in causing lung cancer, and also that other factors such as atmosphericpollution play a part.    Two known carcinogenic agents have been identified in tobacco smoke, but whether they have a direct role in producing lung cancer, and if so what, has not been proved.4.      Statistically it seems clear that the heavier the smoking thegreater the risk, that cigarette smoking carries with it a greater riskthan pipe smoking and that by giving up smoking the risk can be materially reduced.     But it is still true that there is not yet anyscientifically conclusive proof established by research, which goessteadily on.     That being so, I do not feel able to go further at presentthan to make these facts known.    I shall of course keep the Housefully informed of any further developments.
