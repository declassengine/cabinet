CONFIDENTIAL,C.P. (56) 8824th March, 1956.CABINETIRON AND STEEL prices memorandum by the President of the. Board of TradeIUnder the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, the Iron and Steel Boardmay fix maximum prices and since their appointment they have done so.    They first adopted the statutory maximum prices which were then in force.    During 1954 they increased these prices by 3 per cent andin July, 1955, a further increase of 5 per cent took place.    TheChairman of the Iron and Steel Board has now informed me that present prices do not cover the full current costs of production and provide themargins regarded by the Board as reasonable, and that his Board intend to increase prioes by the order of 3 per cent to 3-1 per cent early inApril,    These increases are attributed especially to the markedlyhigher costs of imported raw materials and of imported semi-finished steel.2.        The principles which guide the Board in fixing maximum prices are set out in their first Annual Report.    Broadly they basethemselves on cost of production but exclude the least efficientproducers.    They allow for depreciation on a replacement cost basis.As to the rate of profit we have been told in confidence that in calculatingmaximum prices the Board in fact allow 10 per cent return on85 per cent of the capital employed and that this is equivalent tollf- per cent when the industry is working near capacity.3.        I do not consider that the margins to which the steel industry is working are unreasonable.    It would be unwise, at a time when theindustry is expanding its capacity rapidly at great cost, to depressthose margins by not increasing prices when costs rise.    Moreover,steel is at the present time not only a relatively scarce material butalso a comparatively cheap one.    Our engineers buy their steel from our steelmakers cheaper than their competitors in Europe from theirsteelmakers.    We can reasonably make our steel a little more expensiveand therefore a little less attractive whilst still enjoying a margin overthe foreigner.4.        The increases which have taken place in steel prices betweenJuly of last year, when I assumed responsibility for iron and steel,and the present day have underlined another anomaly.    Iron and steelscrap is controlled under the Defence Regulations (and has been since193 9) at an artifically low figure which does not represent the relativevalues as between scrap and pig iron in steel making.    After the newincreases have come into effect, unless some step is taken to narrowthe gap, or at least to prevent it from widening, scrap will be soldat a controlled price of about  8 a ton whereas its economic figure inCOPY NO.
lb irelation to pig iron would be  16 a ton.    Of this gap of  8,   2 is accounted for by the increases in steel prices since the middle of lastyear.    I should wish to maintain the margin between scrap and pigprices which existed in July last by making an Order under the defence regulations increasing the price of scrap by on average  2.    The board have advised that, if scrap prices are to be increased, it would be convenient to do this at the same time as alterations are made in themaximum prices of iron and steel.    This will entail a further increasein the price of steel of 1^ per cent.5.        I propose, therefore, to inform the Chairman of the Iron andSteel Board that I intend to make an Order increasing the price of scrapby on average  2 a ton so that he may make the required adjustment in steel prices - which will then be an increase of 4^- per cent to 4-f- per cent.This wall still leave our engineering industries with a price advantage over their Continental competitors.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.I.,24th March, 1956.
