DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 59 COPY NO     8118 June 1974,CABINETVOLUNTARY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE YEAR AHEADNote by the Secretary of State for employment. I report below the outcome of my discussioxxs with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) aboutcollective bargaining after the abolition of the statutory pay controls;and my proposals for moving to the voluntary arrangements envisaged.2.        I aim to introduce the Order abolishing the pay controls promptlyafter the Prices Bill receives Royal Assent.    On present plans the order would be laid early in July and I would make a statement to the House,shortly before or In the debate, saying what we expect to follow thestatutory controls.    I would hope to announce at the same time theChairman, terms of reference and date for establishing the RoyalCommission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth; and to givea date for the coming into operation of the independent conciliation and Arbitration Service.3.        Already the TUC have announced their Economic Committee&apos;sendorsement on 12 June of the proposed statement by the TUC on the factors which should influence member unions in pay negotiations afterthe return to voluntary collective bargaining.    The TUC intend to issue the statement on 26 June (assuming General Council approval on that day)and it will be reported to Congress in September.    I shall circulate the tuc draft of this guidance in the form approved by the EconomicCommittee-IP4. CBI representatives came to see me on 17 June to express their view of the economic situation and what is required on pay; andthe CBI seem likely to issue a statement of their position after the meetingof their Council on 19 June.5.        The statement of the Governments position that I propose to makeearly in July will then serve to set the TUC and CBI statements in the context of the social contract and of the economic situation, and to providethe basis for the debate on the Order abolishing the pay controls,    A draftof this statement is at Annex 1.1
6. A timetable covering all these events is at Annex 2.THE TUC STATEMENT7. The TUC circular of 11 April to member unions has been mosthelpful to the Government in helping us to avoid extensive conflict withthe existing legislation.    Its emphasis on the need to stick to existing agreements and the limited scope for use of my consent powers has been an important factor in easing us through the pay round to this point of transition from the statutory controls to voluntary arrangements.    Ihave also received considerable informal assistance in dealing withtroublesome problems.8. The draft of the new TUC statement is again very helpful andgoes as far as we could wish in a number of respects, including -a. The emphasis on the limited scope for increases in consumption in the coming year and the consequent need to concentrate on maintaining rather than increasing real incomes.b. The need to stick to the 12-month rule and so avoid generalrenegotiation of existing agreements.c. The need for negotiators to take account of thresholdpayments already received in claiming compensation for therise in the cost of living since the last settlement,d. The need for conciliators and arbitrators to take accountof the TUC guidance in the same way as others involved in pay negotiations.9. The draft guidance does also list a number of objectives (includingprogress towards four weeks&apos; holiday and a minimum wage) which couldsignificantly increase earnings over and above the basic aim of maintainingreal incomes.    These are in themselves aims that we would welcome andthe achievement of equal pay by the end of 1975 is of course a legalrequirement.    The possibility of making progress towards these long-standing TUC objectives is essential if union members are generally toaccept the TUC guidance; and the guidance does make plain that effectivepriority for these objectives does depend on negotiators constructivelyfocusing on arrangements which will increase industrial output and efficiency.10.       The TUC insist on unilateral statements.    They maintain thatthere is a greater probability of the guidance being heeded within the union movement if it comes from the movement itself and is not thought to be the outcome of collusion with employers or the Government.    They thereforedo not propose to seek agreement on their statement with the government or the CBI.    I am sure that their intuition on this has been absolutely right and all my meetings with them have been informal.
THE CBI STATEMENT11.        My discussions with the CBI have been fewer and equally informal.Their officials are thinking along much the same lines as the TUC, forexample, on the 12-month rule and the maintenance of real earnings withaccount taken of threshold payments.    But they have warned that there isquite as much pressure from employers to pay over the odds as there is from unions, and we can by no means rely on employers to take a toughline in negotiation.12.       Following the CBI meeting with me on 17 June they said publicly that they had emphasised the seriousness of the economic situation andthe need to restrain pay increases.    This was in preparation for the CBICouncil meeting on 19 June, which will be discussing the CBI attitude to therestoration of voluntary collective bargaining.    Some statement of their view is likely to be given afterwards and I impressed on the CBI on 17 june the desirability of seeing that whatever they said did not undermine thecoming TUC statement.THE GOVERNMENT &apos;S STATEMENT13.       The Government may be asked to comment on the TUC statement on 26 June.    In that event I think that we should simply welcome their statement as a very helpful response within the social contract and holdback our main statement in readiness for the debate on the Order abolishing the pay controls.14.       We need to decide whether the Government statement should be a white Paper or made orally in the House,    We shall in fact have little newto say coming after the TUC and CBI statements and it would look distinctlythin as a White Paper.    But the overriding argument in my view for an oralstatement is the desirability of letting the TUC document stand alone as the single written statement of guidance to union negotiators.    It will not help with union members - quite the reverse - to incorporate the guidance in aGovernment document, and leaving the field to the TUC document will makethe sense of self-discipline that much stronger.LIKELY EFFECT ON INFLATION15.       We undoubtedly run the risk of a spate of fresh pay increases whenthe controls end - not least among middle management.    Some employerswill be as eager to pay as their workers to receive.    We can hope to haveaverted a general reopening by our action on the hardest cases such asnurses and on the special problem of London Weighting.    The TUCstatement is helpful both in its recognition of this action and in itsemphasis on the 12-month rule.
16.        Looking beyond the transition, we need to assess the likely impact of the TUC guidance on pay settlements in the coming year.    On currentforecasts earnings next October will stand 22 per cent higher than a yearearlier and the price level will be about 19i per cent higher.    Officialsestimate that the total,addition to the wage and salary bill from the TUCguidance over the period from next November to October 1975 could beabout 19-20 per cent.    This comes from assuming that settlements ofabout 19 per cent will be necessary to maintain real earnings over theyear ahead; that progress on equal pay, low pay, holidays etc will takeanother 5 per cent; and that credit of 4-5 per cent will be given insettlements for threshold payments already received.17.        On this estimate the rise in earnings would moderate slightly.The rate of increase in prices would fall to about ,16 per cent in October1975, compared with 19i per cent in October this year.CONCLUSION13,       I invite my colleagues to approve -i. The proposed approach and timetable of action towards theabolition of statutory pay controls.ii. The line proposed in the draft statement at Annex 2 of theGovernments position which I propose to make to the House forthe debate on the Order abolishing the pay controls.M department of Employment [j18 June 1974
(CONFIDENTIAL)ANNEX 1DRAFT GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITHIN&apos; THESOCIAL CONTRACT ,When the Government took office last March the system of paycontrols was already on the point of collapseo    Its rigid and detailed rules had led not only to the miners1  strike and thethree day week,  but also to an accumulation of anomalies andinefficiencies;    and were helping to spread ill-will and disputes in industry.    The system has not even been succeeding in itsoriginal purpose of curbing inflation.2.      Two clear lessons have emerged from experience over the lasteighteen months.    The first is that the complexity and variety ofthe problems that arise in pay determination are such that solutionscannot for long be imposed successfully through central regulation.The second,  and even more important,  lesson,    is that in a freesociety a counter inflation policy cannot be imposed for long.It must command consent.3.      That is why there must be a fresh approach.    The responsibilityfor determining pay must be handed back to where it belongs - with employers and unions.    And the Government must create the conditions for a new social and economic equality in which it will be possiblefor trade unions and their members to co-operate in policies tokeep down prices while enabling money incomes to grow in line with industrial production.THE RETURN TO VOLUNTARY BARGAINING4.      The Government therefore accepted from the outset the need toreturn to voluntary collective bargaining.    The very -first act ontaking office was, within the constraints imposed by the CounterInflation Act,  to enable the Coal Board and the miners to reach asettlement of their pay dispute through free negotiation and soget industry back to full-time working.    Power was then sought inthe Prices Bill to abolish the pay controls at the earliest opportunity.    As soon as the power was available, a draft Order forthis purpose was tabled and,  subject to its approval by both Houses,the statutory controls will be removed in.the course of July.5.      The transition to voluntary arrangements will not be easy.People will naturally want to remedy immediately the many difficulties and grievances produced by the statutory controls;    and there mustbe a risk of some fresh increases in earnings when the statutorycontrols go.    That risk has to be taken;    retaining the controls isnot the answer.6.      However,  in the interests of Securing an orderly transition,  ithas been the Government&apos;s policy,  within the limits imposed by the counter Inflation Act,  to mitigate the worst of the anomalies towhich the pay controls have given rise.    Consents have been issued in a number of cases.    Special reviews have recently been set upfor the nurses and teachers;    and negotiations have been enabled to proceed for Post Office workers- and,  in the light of the pay board report on London Weighting,  to deal with the special problems(CONFIDENTIAL)
CONFIDENTIALof those working in London.    With arrangements made for theseparticularly hard cases,  the Government look to other people notto re-open settlements but to heed the TUC guidance that the12 month interval between major increases should generally bemaintained.    Unless it is,  it will just not be possible to fulfil the Government&apos;s other policies within the Social Contract -on rents,   food subsidies,  pensions and the rest.     ... .  .;7.      But the Government do not expect to see a senseless wages ..explosion.    The resumption of voluntary collective bargaining willinstead, enable employers and unions to make settlements apt totheir circumstances and conducive to the increase of output and efficiency.     Indeed,  it must be the object to alter the approach to collective bargaining so that,   as the TUC put it, ,&quot;Primary and positive emphasis will be laid on the contribution that improved systems of collective bargainingcan make to improving output,  services,  efficiency andemployment prospects and to eradicating low pay&quot;.Within the framework of this system,  and to help it work more effectively, we propose to establish two hew institutions - theConciliation and Arbitration Service and the Royal Commission onthe Distribution of Income and Wealth.8.      There is a clear need to establish better and more acceptablearrangements for avoiding or speedily resolving bargaining disputeswhenever and wherever they occur.    The policies of our predecessorsled to confrontation and on some issues withheld the traditionalmeans whereby conflicts could be resolved..    The neOessary processes of conciliation and arbitration,  and their acceptability,   suffered.These processes now need to be effectively re-established in a way which attracts the full confidence and participation of tradeunions and managements.    This is the purpose of the conciliation and Arbitration Service,  which will be managed and developed by anindependent Council,  including representatives of the TUC and GBI.It will provide conciliation and arbitration services which arefreely and readily available both nationally and locally and itwill seek to develop and improve collective bargaining machinery.Both the TUC and CBI have welcomed the creation of such a serviceand have agreed to give it their full support.    Arrangements for&quot;its establishment are well advanced and the Government aim to have it in full operation by      /&quot; 1 September under the chairmanship of9.      The Royal Commission has a different role.    The Governmentare determined to create a fairer society and as a first step towards this we need to establish in a much more thorough and comprehensive way than has been attempted hitherto the facts aboutthe distribution of incomes and wealth of all kinds - earned andUnearned.    The Government envisage the Royal Commission rangingover the whole field,   on the&apos;basis of references made to it by theGovernment,  producing reports of a factual nature which will assistand. Inform policy makers and those who are active in collective bargaining.    The Commission will thus have a wide educational andindicative function.    The Government intend to set it up /&quot;at aboutthe same time as the pay controls are abolished,  under the chairman-ship of /.
(confidential)THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. - :- r:      - -   &apos;10. The Royal Commission will contribute also to the secondleg of this fresh approach to the control of inflation and the attainment of a higher standard of living - the recognition ofthe claims of social justice.    The essence of the social contractis that the Government should provide the framework within whichnegotiators will be able to operate the collective bargainingsystem,  having regard to the action which is being taken by theGovernment over the whole range of social and economic policies.As constructive action is taken by the Government to secure afair distribution of the national wealth,   so the government believe that the trade unions and their members will co-operate to make the policy as a whole  successful.11.    The Government have made clear that xve understand the need to tackle rising prices;     to help those most badly hit byinflation and poverty;     and to make the country a much fairer place to live in.    We have therefore . &quot;&apos; -- given immediate help to the pensioners by the largestsingle increase in pensions ever given in this country;- taken steps to moderate the rise in the cost of livingby imposing stricter price controls on the marging ofwholesalers and retailers;    by requiring a minimuminterval of 3 months in most cases between increases bymanufacturers;     and by introducing food subsidies.Additional expenditure of  500 million will be incurred on food subsidies,  which will significantly reduce therise in the Retail Price Index and particularly the risein food prices;- provided a  500 million loan to the building societies tohelp keep mortgage rates down;- increased personal income tax on the, better off,  whilerelieving l-g million people of the liability for income&apos; tax;&apos; &apos; &apos; o- introduced a rent freeze;- introduced legislation to repeal the Industrial relations act,  which we  expect to be law by the end of this month.12,    All this has been done since the Government took office.More is in hand.    Thus,- there will be a thorough review of the Price Code duringthe summer.    This will consider whether the Code needs to be modified in the interests of encouraging investment,without however departing from the objective of maintaining a strict control of prices in a period of inflation;- work is proceeding on the proposals for legislation to repeal the Housing and Finance Act and for bringing into public ownership all the building land needed for development during the rest of this century;(confidential)
- a Green Paper will be issued soon with proposals fora Wealth Tax;- an Employment Protection Bill will be introduced next session and the Industrial Democracy Bill will follow thatflSCOPE FOR FURTHER ACTION &apos;   &apos;-&apos; . &apos;    &apos;13,    But in developing the social contract further the countryfaces problems of priorities.    It was already generally; ,acceptedbefore the Government took office that,  partly because of theeffect of the three-day week and partly because of the oil pricerise,  the expectations of economic growth forecast in october last year had been falsified and that there would be little if anyroom for improvement in living standards in 197&apos;i-lk*    Taking 197zl as&apos; a whole total output,   so far from showing aconsiderable increase on 1973*   is likely to be lower than lastyear.    At the  same time the deficit on the balance of payments on [current account increased in the first four months of 197k to anannual rate of some        000m,   compared with an annual rate of -a   Ilittle over  2,000m in the second half of 1973 *- -15,    The total resources available for all our needs are less thanthey were  expected to be.    But we must give greater priority tothe needs of exports and the balance of payments,   and will continueto have to do this,   at least until we can get most of the oil we need from the North Sea.    This means that we must maintain thecompetitiveness of our exports.    It also means that we must devotemore of our resources to investment.    So,  for the community as awhole,   the scope for improving the standard of living throughhigher consumption will for some time continue to be small,THE RESPONSE FROM THE TUC16,    The TUC General Council have acknowledged that the Governmenthave demonstrated their commitment to the social contract and have jmade much progress in implementing it.    Against this backgroundthey have made their own response.    Their Economic Review 197^reiterated the pledge on special cases given at the time of theminers&apos;1  dispute,  and this has been honoured.    Their circular of 11 April accepted that it would take time to abolish the statutory&apos;controls and supported the Government 1s view that the general pattern of settlements should continue for the remainder of thepresent period.    Now that the restoration of voluntary collective bargaining is in sight the General Council have issued theirreport on Collective Bargaining and the Social Contract oh26 June giving guidance for negotiators in the voluntary situation.The Government warmly welcome this contructive response by the 1TUC and their assistance in the further development of the- social contract.17.    The TUC had already recognised in their Economic Review 197^:that there was little scope for increasing personal consumptionoverall this year.    Their latest statement further recognises that it follows from this that,   for the,present,   the aim of tradeunion negotiation,  while seeking improvement in priority areas such; as low pay and equal pay,   should be the maintenance ratherthan the improvement of real incomes. &apos;
(confidential)l8. Their detailed guidance to those concerned with determining pay-in accordance with this aim gives the following important advicej,(i)    Negotiators should focus constructively on the need tomake the maximum use of resources and on arrangements -which will have beneficial effects on efficiency andunit costs,  because this is at the root of efforts tosecure progressive improvments.&quot;in&apos;pay and conditions. &apos;Obviously,   this is where the emphasis will have to belaid in making progress on priority areas such as lowpay;(ii)    The twelve month&apos; interval between major increases should in general continue to apply;// which means that thereshould be no general re-opening of principal settlementsbefore the due time for negotiating the next;(iii)    In claiming compensation for the rise in the cost ofliving since  the last settlement,  negotiators will take into account compensation for current price increasesalready received under threshold agreements.    the guidance recognises that,   in pursuing the policy ofmaintining real incomes,   some negotiators may prefer to look forward and,   instead of a settlement to compensate for the past,  may wish to negotiate a sliding scalearrangement to keep up with the cost of living during their new agreement. .   .,,19o    The General Council will be keeping the developing situation under review and will advise unions in difficulties in conforming tothe spirit of the TUC policy.THE GOVERNMENTS POSITION20.    This is an extremely important statement which the Governmentwarmly welcome as responding to the requirements of the national situation in a clear and helpful fashion.    The Government recognisethat the TUC guidance applies equally to the public and to theprivate sector and there must be no discrimination.    As an employerthe Government will themselves seek to reach responsible settlements in accordance with this guidance through the existing procedures for determining public service pay.21.    On the particular question of equal pay,   it is necessary to remember that the Equal Pay Act will come into force in December1975.    Every agreement or pay structure which does not at presentmeet the requirements of that Act/ will have to be brought into line with it by that date.    So all concerned with pay determinationshould bear in mind the need to make steady and orderly progress towards full implementation of equal pay by the end of next year.22.    /For their part the CBI have accepted that the statutorycontrols have outlived their usefulness.    They have welcomed thegreater flexibility offered by the system of voluntary collective(confidential)
bargaining and the opportunity to negotiate within a frameworkwhich encourages emphasis on pay arrangements-which make thefullest use of resources and have a beneficial effect on unitCosts,    They have made plain that they too endorse the TUCguidance for:negotiators^^CONCLUSION23,    We.have to recognise the extreme.difficulty of the problemsof reducing and controlling the rate of inflation and of more rapidly improving the standard of living.    Different solutionshave been tried in the pastj  in this country and abroad, with no lasting success - and sometimes with dismal failure.    One      1thing in the Government1 s view,   is fundamental *- a counterinflation policy can operate only by consent and through theco-operation of the community generally.    That demands fromthe Government effective action to  set us on the path towards a more just and equal and wealthier society.    This action theGovernment are taking.    What the Government now ask is forgeneral recognition from the community that the desired social and economic advance will just not be attainable in the presentserious situation unless there is general observance of the tuc guidance and a responsible acceptance of the opportunities for improving our economic position afforded by the return to voluntary collective bargaining.
