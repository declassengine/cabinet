DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 66 COPY NO     $ \1 July 1974CABINET^ NUCLEAR REACTOR policy note by the Secretary of State for Energy1. Following the Cabinefs discussion of the choice of nuclearreactor systems on 13 June (CC(74) 19th Conclusions, Minute 5),I attach a draft of the White Paper which I propose to issue with astatement in Parliament in more or less identical terms.2.        Subject to consultation with the Lord President of the Counciland Lord Privy Seal on timing, my aim is to make the statementduring the second week of July and to attach to the White Paper thereport of the Nuclear Power Advisory Board, the draft ofwhich is currently being cleared with the members of the Board.3.        I am currently holding confidential discussions on our decisions with the main nuclear interests and will report the outcome orally tothe Cabinet.4.        I invite the Cabinet to approve -a. the draft White Paper;b. the procedure for announcement and publication outlined above.E V Department of Energy1 Jtfy 1974
NUCLEAR REACTOR SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION1      This White Paper sets out the Government1s policy on nuclearreactor systems.2 ! The Government have taken account of the report by the SelectCommittee on Science and Technology (House of Commons Paper 145 73i-vii Session 1973-4).    This White Paper forms their reply.J      The Government have had advice from the Nuclear Power advisory board (NPAB).    The Secretary of State for Energy has agreed with theNPAB that their advice should be published.    It- is set out as an annex to this White Paper.    The NPAB&apos;s working papers must remainconfidential.4-      The Secretary of State for Energy has had wide discussions withthe organisations represented on the NPAB, reactor component manu-facturers, trade union and staff association representatives and organisations concerned with conservation and the environment.NEXT NUCLEAR ORDERS5      The Government have decided that the Electricity Boards should adopt the pressure tube Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR)for their next nuclear, power station orders. l!6      The SGHWR offers substantial advantages.    In the Government&apos;sjudgement it will provide power reliably and we can proceed to orderit quickly.   We must maintain public confidence in nuclear power.    TheChief Inspector of Nuclear Installations advises that there should beno fundamental difficulties in giving SGHWR safety clearance.Reliability and the confidence we can have in a system are moreimportant to our electricity supplies than a narrow calculation ofcapital costs.   SGHWR offers particular scope for British nucleartechnology and we should exploit it.    The 100 megawatt (MW) prototypeat Winfrith has now been operating successfully for 6 years and is designed to reproduce the operating conditions of a commercial unit.Canadian experience with their commercial heavy water pressure tubesystem - CANDU - is also successful at a reactor size of about&apos; 500 MW.7      It is for these reasons that the Government believe SGHWR is theright system for the UK to pursue.   We shall be moving forward froma prototype to a commercial size and design.   While we are gainingexperience, it therefore seems sensible for us to start withreactor units of 600-660 MW rather than a larger size so as to reducethe problems of scaling-up;    also for the initial programme to be relatively modest - not more than 4000 MW over the next 4 years.    TheGovernment are asking the Central Electricity. Generating Board and theScottish Boards to set preparatory work in hand jointly.    A firstorder for a 2 x 660&apos;MW station will be placed as soon as possible.8      After the initial programme the aim should be to build up ordersas rapidly as progress allows.    For this we shall need to establish a strong industrial capability.    It is important that industry andthe people working in it should&quot; have sufficient confidence in the
development of the programme to invest in skills and facilities.    the initial orders will provide a sound base for the future.\-0-&apos;;&apos;.::,. .i--&apos;.y;.:.-.-v &apos;  -    ..&apos;v      .-    ;..      - .Co-operation with Canada9      Both the British and Canadian Governments see great advantage in co-operation, covering the technology and supply of heavy water,reactor R&amp;D and the design and manufacture of components.    In part-particular the Canadian authorities have provided assurances on the supplyof heavy water for our first stations.    At a later stage we expect toconstruct our own heavy water plant.   UK nuclear organisations andthe Electricity Boards will be discussing co-operation with theirCanadian counterparts at the earliest possible opportunity.OTHER SYSTEMS... . . ;10     Our first commitment to the future must be the success of SGHVR.On the other systems the Governments policy is as follows:-.Magnox11     The Government accept   the advice of the NPAB that Magnox,despite its generally good operation, would not be suitable for a major new programme.    This could detract from our main effort forthe future.Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR)12     It is essential to complete the AGR programme satisfactorily.But the system has yet to provide operating experience to offset theproblems encountered in construction.    The Government accept theNPAB&apos;s advice that it would be unwise to place further orders for AGRbefore evidence of successful operation. HHigh Temperature Reactor (HTR)if:; -       ; ...... :&apos; \.-1?     The Government are asking the nuclear organisations to pursuefurther the prospects of participating in international developmentof HTR.    The system has considerable potential.    Our experience of gas-cooled technology would be of great value to its international development.   But HTR is not suitable for the Electricity Boards&apos;main programmes at this time.   Further, the Government accept theadvice of the NPAB that we do not have the resources for a substantialeffort on HTR, while we are launching SGHWR and completing the AGRs.In particular an immediate demonstration order is not practicable.Participation in an international programme could lead to.orders inthe UK in the future if we so wish.Light Water Reactor (LWR)14    The- Government are not prepared to authorise any commitment toLWR.   This does not imply any judgement about the validity of thetechnical doubts expressed by some on safety.    The Government have asked the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to carry through to conclusions their examination of the generic safety issues.Fast Reactor15    The Government will maintain our effort on the Fast Reactor onwhich we are in the forefront of technology.    The 250 MW prototypeat Bounreay is now being brought to full power.    The Government are2
21    Discussions on reactor policy have been prolonged.   Strong views and positions have naturally developed.   But the period of uncertaintyis now over.   The Government&apos;s decision offers the prospects of afurther - publicly acceptable - development of nuclear power in the uk.   It is important that all concerned should work together to makea success of our nuclear programme.T July 1974asking the nuclear organisations to pursue urgently the prospects forfurther international co-operation, covering development ana the start of commercial ordering. Work on safety will he particularly important.FOSSIL ORDERS16    The present decision will dictate the pattern of nuclear andfossil ordering over the next 3-4- years.    For reasons of prudence wemust limit the initial programme of SGHWR and shall need to meet thebalance of our further requirements during this period with new fossilplant.    But we are fortunately placed with major fossil reserves.    The government will take decisions on the capital investment for new fossilstations progressively, depending on load growth.17     In the later 1970s our nuclear options should widen.   We should in particular be able to step up the SGHWR programme given satisfact-ory initial experience of construction.MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE18    Public confidence in nuclear power will depend not only on the safety of the systems we build.   We shall have to keep very careful,watch over the environmental implications of radioactive wastes.   TheRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution are examining these and related issues.   The Government will consider with care any recommenda-tions they make.19    The Government Inspectorates concerned at present believe it unlikely that the accumulation and storage of wastes need restrainour planned nuclear power programme.IMPLEMENTING POLICY20    The Government are discussing with the Electricity Boards andthe nuclear industry the detailed implementation of their policy.
