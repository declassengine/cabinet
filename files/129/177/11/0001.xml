document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT9 1C(74) 61 COPY NO     0124 June 1974CABINETRENEGOTIATION AND RELATED EUROPEAN economic community QUESTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs.        As promised in my memorandum of 19 June I am now circulating a further memorandum on renegotiation and related questions as a basis for discussion in Cabinet this week,   I shall then be able to report orallyon matters of interest which emerged from the Foreign Ministers council meeting on 25 June,2.        The issue of the Community budget will be a major renegotiationproblem within the Community.    The Commission were asked by theCouncil on 4 June to produce a &quot;stock-taking&quot; of the situation sinceenlargement and up to 1980.    This essential first step has placed theproblem firmly on the Council agenda.    We must hope that theCommission^ report will help to convince other member governments that we have a strong case for insisting that changes be made.    But I donot and never have under-estimated the difficulties.    We are still someway from achieving an active and constructive discussion of solutions.Even if we can get it agreed that this should go forward, other member governments will at the least want to cut the benefit to us to the minimumin order that the additional burden on themselves (or in some cases the decrease in their net gain) should be as small as possible.   As regardstiming, it is now widely believed among other Foreign Ministers that weare going to have an election in the autumn and their Governments are unlikely to be willing to commit themselves very far until they know theresult.Ii3.        The Minister of Agriculture launched our Common agricultural policy (CAP) renegotiation at the 18 June Agriculture Council.   He speltout in greater detail the requests for changes which I outlined in my statement in the Council on 4 June.   It was agreed that the various elementscontained in his statement would be dealt with within the framework of thework which the Council has set itself to carry out in the course of thecoming months.   He will wish to describe reactions himself, but it was satisfactory that no delegation argued against this course.j . m     x I,
4e On trade and aid, we are moving forward on a number of differentfronts. The Minister of Overseas Development contributed significantlyto the progress made at the Development Council on 13 June when:-a. subject to a German reserve, the Council accepted that theCommunity should this year make a $500 million contribution to a fund for those countries which are worst hit by the rise in oilprices (which, it is hoped, should to a considerable extent be financed by savings on the Community budget and to which we shall only contribute 11 per cent of any new money in accordance with the transitional arrangements for our contribution to the community budget); and b. subject to a French reserve, the Council accepted theprinciple of aid to non-associates.The &quot;reserves&quot; are important because of the &quot;consensus&quot; policy but ifthese agreements are eventually confirmed, countries such as India shouldbenefit, in the short term from a. above and in the longer term from b.;and an important first step will have been taken towards getting a betterbalance between the Community^ aid policy towards its own associates andits policy towards other developing countries.   A further meeting of theDevelopment Council is to be held on 16 July to consider these matters.These meetings have in the past been held only rarely.    We have thusalready had some success in getting the Community to treat its aidobligations more seriously and more urgently.5.        The African, Caribbean and Pacific countries of the Commonwealthhave made clear to us that an Association Agreement with the community is of great importance to them,    &quot;We hope to push forward during June and july towards a new convention acceptable to all the commonwealth countries concerned, a convention which, we shall insist, ought not to bebased, as was the Yaounde Convention, on a rather spurious tradereciprocity.   In addition, on the trade front, the mandate for the multilateral trade negotiations and improvements to the GeneralisedScheme of Preferences will also begin to be discussed before the summerholidays.6,        As regards Regional and Industrial policy, the Secretary of Statefor Industry visited Brussels on 18 June for exploratory talks.    The nextstep is to pursue the question of regional aids in the Working Party on that subject, as agreed in the Ministerial Committee on European CommunityStrategy on 15 May.    Discussions with the Commission on industrial policy will also be required.7,        Sovereignty is rightly a matter of concern to the House of Commons.It is now being examined by the Legislation Committee which is preparingpapers on:&apos; 2
a. current Parliamentary practice in other member States forscrutiny of Community proposals;b. possible institutional development in the Community and its implications;c. suitability of existing United Kingdom Parliamentaryprocedures.The Cabinet will not wish to anticipate the Committee&apos;s conclusions.    Wehave already ensured, by the decisions we have taken in regard to the scrutiny Committees, that the British Parliament will exercise controlover the actions of Ministers in the Councils of the Community, where allthe main decisions are taken.    But the Legislation Committee will be considering what else needs to be done.    I should therefore merely like inthis memorandum to describe briefly some of the discussions I have had inthe Community which have a bearing on the subject.    A background note onthe question is attached at Annex.8, The agreement at the 1972 Paris summit to have &quot;European Union&quot;by 1980 turns out on investigation to have been completely without content.&quot;European Union by 1980&quot; is a slogan or a banner to which many Europeansattach great importance and which the German and other Governments needfor internal political reasons to hold out to their people as a long-term aim.But from my discussions with the other Foreign Ministers at Schloss Gymnichin April and at Bonn in early June, it has emerged quite clearly that none ofthem (not even the Dutch who claim to be the most &quot;federalist&quot;) seriouslyexpect the Community to change the present basis for its decision-makingin the foreseeable future.    When further discussions of &quot;European Union&quot;take place I shall hold to the view that all important decisions shouldcontinue to be taken by unanimous consensus in the Council of ministers and I believe the other member states will agree.    Indeed, summing upthe discussion at Gymnich, the then German Foreign Minister, Herr Scheel,said that one of the things that all members were agreed upon was that theCouncil was the motive force of any future progress.    A confederal solutionof this kind is certainly not inconsistent with maintaining the degree of sovereignty at which we aim.   Nothing will be decided without Her MajestylsGovernments agreement and Her Majesty&apos;s Government will only agree if itcan expect to obtain the consent of Parliament.9.        The &quot;political co-operation&quot; machinery, where I have been discussing this question of European Union is, strictly speaking, outsidethe Community framework although the same countries of course take partin it.    The object is to reach common positions of the Nine on internationalquestions.   In my view it has a very useful role to play.   It is clear thatnationel solutions on the crucial questions such as energy, inflation,commodities and the world international monetary crisis, are not sufficient.Equally, the Nine cannot by themselves find solutions.    But they can. 3
collectively influence events in a way which individual european governments cannot.    In the light of the discussions in which I have taken part I am forming the opinion that the political influence of the UnitedKingdom is of considerable importance to the rest of the Nine.    It isvaluable that we should play our full part in deciding what positions theCommunity should take up.10.;      On specific &quot;political co-operation&quot; matters we have now achieved a far better relationship between the Nine and the United States and I amhopeful that two-way consultation across the Atlantic will now workproperly, thus getting away from the transatlantic quarrels whichcharacterised the last year of the Conservative Government.    The Ninehave also agreed to initiate a dialogue with the Arab states designed toimprove economic and technical co-operation with them, and to set in handsomething of an equivalent nature with Israel.    I was impressed by thebusiness-like way in which the last Ministerial meeting of the Nine reached its common positions on these and other matters such as the Conferenceon Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE),11.        To sum up, renegotiation is now under way on the basis of the manifesto,    So far we have not needed to seek a confrontation, but in the months ahead we may have to face a confrontation on some issues.    I amready for that if necessary.   As regards sovereignty, we have already taken steps to enhance the role of the British Parliament, and there isno question of Council decisions being taken or Council legislation enactedagainst our will.    In some ways our renegotiation has required theCommunity to take a new look at itself and make a fresh start after many months of stagnation.    It is now looking in a more constructive directionat a number of important issues and I am grateful to my colleagues, inparticular to the Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary of State for Tradeand the Minister of Overseas Development for the influence they haveexerted in the various Councils to achieve progress towards ourrenegotiation aims.    Our own policy is proceeding along the lines agreed by the Cabinet and as satisfactorily as we could expect at this early stage.There are two further questions - timing and manner of consultation withthe British people.    We have not set any formal time limit to the  hrenegotiations, although in conversation with other Foreign Ministers, Ihave indicated that we must be prepared to come to a conclusion on theissue by the end of December or at the latest in January or February.Given the slowness with which these matters proceed, this does not give us too much time, but if we are to avoid cynicism among our people (aswe must) the negotiations cannot drag on indefinitely.12.       We must also reiterate constantly in our public statements ourpledge that the British people will have the opportunity to express their view at the end of the renegotiations.    If I can judge from mycorrespondence, some people value the pledge that they will be able toexpress their opinion, as much as they do the contents of the renegotiationpackage itself.4
13. In due course, I shall be ready to put some proposals forward  orthe Cabinefs decision.LJCwForeign and Commonwealth Office24 June 19745
ANHBXSOVEREIGNTY AND THE EEC1.   All governments have to recognise an increasing, degree of inter-dependance.   The number of problems in the economic and strategic field which can be solved on a national basis hasbeen diminishing and will probably continue to diminish.   Forexample, the three great problems of \37k \- energy, the effectofj petro-dollars on international monetary arrangements and world-wide inflation - all require international solutions.This will inevitably mean accepting some restrictions on the absolute freedom of individual governments to settle questions affecting their own vital interests or to take decisions which affect other governments and peoples.2.   The concept of national sovereignty has been affected to a major degree by the development of international organisationssince the Second World War*   By signing the United HfationsCharter, member states (though Permanent Members of the security council have a special position) accepted that the security council should have powers to pass mandatory resolutions, egRhodesia.   By joining NATO the European countries have learnt to live without a major attribute of absolute sovereignty in returnfor the benefits of collective security.   By signing the revisedBrussels Treaty setting up WEU, we not only entered into an automatic commitment to mutual defence, but agreed to keep a specific number of troops on the continent for fifty years.   Bysigning the GATT, member states accepted important restrictions,in regard to trading practices (eg import restrictions anddumping) in return for wider trading advantages.   By joiningEFTA, member states not only accepted certain further restrictionson absolute sovereignty in regard to trade but also somelimitations in regard to industrial competition, eg publicpurchasing.   Those who want to draw on the IMF have to accept a.degree of surveillance of the management of their economies.3.   This is the background against which to consider the special position of the e.c..   One important difference at once stands out.The Community is different in kind to other international organisations in the important respect of e.c. secondarylegislation.   The operation of the Scrutiny Committees, and theapplication of the other measures derived from the Foster report,will be of the greatest importance here.   Ministers will be considering the role of Parliament further in the legislation committee.A.
ko   The Gommunity was conceived by its founding fathers as apolitical organisation which would eventually go a good dealfarther than other international organisations in the mergingof sovereignty.   The Commission was conceived as a embryofederal government.   Majority voting in the Council was foreseenon a number of important issues.    So far, however, the member states have not been willing to move in a federal direction.Nor have they any clear idea about the eventual political: destination to which closer unity may take them.   Meanwhile,decisions on all important matters are in practice takenunanimously.   And, where the Commission has powers under the treaties, for example in regard to competition matters, theseare usually exercised in a way which shows that members of theCommission are politically sensitive to the national requirements&apos; of member states&apos;and to what is politically possible in them.5.   Between 1969 and 1972 the original Community of Six developedambitious-sounding plans, first for &quot;Economic and Monetary Union&quot;and then, at the Paris Summit in 1972, for &quot;European Union&quot; by1980.   Plans for the first have gone awry and new and more practical policies will have to be evolved if any progress towards convergence between the economies of the Community isto be achieved.   As regards &quot;European Union&quot;, no definitionexists and work on the subject is only just beginning.   Myunderstanding is that no one is going to press for changes inthe basis on which the Community takes its decisions, namely by unanimous consensus of the member states in Council.   On both these subjects we shall be in on the ground floor in all futurediscussions and nothing will be agreed in the Community which wedo not accept06.    It is undoubtedly true that by accepting jaontinued membership of the Community we would accept certain restrictions on our freedom in a number of fields.   At the end of the day we shallhave to balance the advantages against the restrictions.   Weshall need to return to this important subject when theLegislation Committee has completed its work
