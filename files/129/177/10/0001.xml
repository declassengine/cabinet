BSC RENEGOTIATIONSpeech by Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Mr James Callaghan at theCouncil of Ministers Meeting in Luxembourg, on h June.At the Meeting of the -Council on 1 April I undertook to place before you in greater detail the matters which the United Kingdom findsunsatisfactory in its membership of the Community and which we seek to change.   In amplification of my statement on Renegotiation of 1 Aprilwhich remains the basic document on the subject for the United Kingdom,I should like today to give more details of the kind of changes we seekin the policies and decisions of the Community under four main headings.First the Community Budget - an important matter for us but one which I recognise will raise difficulties for others.Second the Common Agricultural Policy where we shall be suggestingmajor improvements consistent with the broad, principles on which thepolicy is based.Third the Commonwealth and developing countries where improvementsare necessary in both the trade and aid fields.I :;Fourth Regional and Industrial Policy where it is important forus to be certain that the rules of the Community will enable britain to pursue the effective policies which are required if the British economy is to begin to grow at a rate which will approach the Communityaverage rather than to sink further below it.There is a fifth question about the future of economic monetaryI and political union to which added point has been given by recent1 events which have affected individual members of the Community.   WeI discussed these matters at our recent meeting at Schloss Gymnich and1 will be resuming our talks again shortly so I shall not pursue themItoday, except to say that as I understand it, the position on thesematters is that a great deal of further work and discussion will berequired before any further decisions can&apos;be taken in pursuit of these general aims.   We are very ready to continue with these talks in orderthat we can all elucidate, in a constructive spirit, what content itmay be possible to give to them.As regards the four issues I shall discuss today you will recall that I said on 1 April that our initial approach would be to seek&apos;improvements by way of changes in the Community1 s policies and decisions in preference to proposing changes in the treaties themselves.   In our preparations for today we have adhered to this approach.    In our judgement Ministers will find that the proposals I shall put before youif accepted would not require changes in the treaties and we shall continue on that basis though of course our reserve on treaty amendmentscontinues to stand.As regards the current work of the Community we shall continue toco-operate fully in its work as we have done in recent weeks.    Of courselike other members of the Community, from time to time there will be/issues upon
issues upon which we shall have to put a reserve so as to safeguard our negotiating position but we shall not dp so out of a desire to hold upthe work of the Community but because genuine differences cannot be reconciled.    And we shall play as big a part as anyone in trying to reconcile these differences when they do occur.   We all understand that other nations are looking to the Community for decisions on currentitems of business with which they are concerned and we shall do our test to reach agreements .I have considered whether we should ask you to handle these issuestogether in one forum but we believe that it will make for smoother-writing if we do not ask you to do so.   We suggest that differentprocedures will be appropriate for the different issues that I shalloutline.    In the matter of the Common Agricultural Policy, we suggestthat this should be dealt with in the Agricultural Council.    TheDevelopment Council will deal with most aspects of aid.   Trade matters and, insofar as they need come before Ministers, Regional and Industrialissues will be dealt with in our own Council.   There need be noprocedural problems in these cases.But the Budget issue is somewhat different.    Its handling willrequire special consideration for it is a most important matter forall of us.    It may be that budgetary problems can be taken on theAgenda of this Council or alternatively in the Finance MinistersCouncil whichever seems appropriate.Naturally, we in the United Kingdom shall be looking at theresults of our discussions on these issues as a whole at the end ofthe process and therefore it seems to me appropriate that the Councilof Foreign Ministers should exercise a general oversight over the issues I am about to describe and that if necessary,   the Councillshould be able to give a political impetus to this or that issue ifprogress seems slow.If we can proceed in this way the Council would not find that ithas to accept any appreciable delay in its normal work in order to dealwith these particular issues that are so important to the UnitedKingdom.    It would be our intention to make substantial progress withrenegotiation during the remaining months of this year.   When I returnto London I should like to be able to report to the British parliament and people that we have agreed that discussion of the matters that Iam about to outline will take place in the appropriate machineryof the Community.One more word before I come to outline our proposals.    Mycolleagues will have seen that there is no change in the list of thematters we wish to raise.    These represent the limits of the problems for renegotiation.Community BudgetI begin with our views on the Community Budget.   In recent weekswe have had useful conversations about the impact of the community budget on the United Kingdom with members of the Commission and withrepresentatives of Member Governments.   We have made it clear why weconsider that the impact of the present system is unfair on the/United Kingdom
United Kingdom and could be unfair to other members.     Therefore asolution to the Budget problem is central to our objectives inrenegotiation.We also believe that there is here a problem which should concern the whole Community, if it is to be made to work properly.    it certainly cannot develop in the way the United Kingdom would like,unless there is progress in the direction of economic convergencebetween Member States.    The difficulties   are well known and have been aggravated by the impact of the energy crisis.   The recent severeeconomic strains in the Community, reflect differences in economic circumstances and performance.We ourselves in the United Kingdom have also been subjected tosuch strains, and my Government are taking all possible nationalmeasures to deal with them.    But we are not helped by the presentCommunity Budget arrangements, involving as they do an increasing and serious transfer of resources from the United Kingdom to other membersof the Community.    These will tend to have precisely the oppositeeffect to that which is required if we are to participate in a gradualconvergence of economic growth in the Community.    It is wrong inprinciple and would defeat the objects of the Community if resourcetransfers under the Budget should promote divergence rather thanconvergence.   This is why we believe that our case for fairer treatmentpresents a real problem for the whole of the Community.I know that not everybody around, this table would be ready to endorse the forecasts which we have made about the impact of theCommunity Budget on the United Kingdom, and indeed. I do not ask you toaccept our precise figures.   What I would ask you to accept is that ourfigures are a serious estimate, based- on realistic assumptions, of theorder of magnitude of the burden which the Community Budget places onthe British economy.    It is at least as likely that they will be worseas that they will be better.    I am convinced that any other set, ofassumptions, provided they are realistic, would show that the UnitedKingdom will be undertaking substantial and increasing resource transfersto the Community during the rest of our transitional period up to1977 and on a rapidly growing scale afterwards.To give a few conclusions from our calculations about what willhappen if no solution is found, we estimate that the United Kingdom net contribution would be of the order of three hundred   to three hundred and fifty million units of account in 1975, five hundred and fifty tosixhundred million in 1977* and sevenhundred to eighthundred million in1980.   This would mean a net contribution of about threethousand five-hundred million units of account in. the period 197I+ to 1980.   These areno small sums.   To illustrate this point it is worth drawing attentionto the fact that during the discussions on the size of the CommunityFund for Regional Development, the Community was unable to accept a recommendation from the Commission for a fund of twothousand twohundredand fifty million units of account over three years for all the Membersof the Community.Why is the system likely in this way to oroauce permanent, dis-aclvantages for the United Kingdom?   It is because the &quot;own resources&quot;system was devised to suit a smaller Community made up of countrieswhich are not such large importers as the UK.    It is also because therewill soon be a striking contrast between our expected share of Community/GDI and our
131&apos; end our contribution to the Community Budget.    It is because, not-Kitlistanding our economic position in relations to other members of theEonwnunity, we shall have to provide, as we estimate, about twentyfouripsr cent of the Community&apos;s &quot;own resources&quot; by 1980.Some people may say that we are not entitled to claim that theBritish share of the tariffs and levies which will form the largest    ,oart of the &quot;own resources&quot; of the Community is a &quot;national&quot; contribution.Therefore they say, questions of equality do not arise.   That might bea possible argument if the Community were, in a full economic and monetary union, with a central budget responsible for most of the mainareas of Government expenditure, and with major resource transferstrying place from the more prosperous to the less prosperous areas.But that is not the position.    The Community must take into accountthat it is real resources from its own citizens which each member statesill transfer to the Community under the &quot;own resources&quot; system.   TheCorniaunity cannot close its eyes to an important factor influencing theray in which the economies of its members move relative to each other.Recent estimates suggest that by 1977 our share of Community GDPsill be about sixteen and a half per cent and by 1980 fourteen per cent.Ms is talcing account of favourable factors such as North Sea Oil,ivhich will be an immense help to our balance of payments as the decadegoes on.    But it cannot produce a rapid and substantial change in ourgrowth rate.    These estimates assume an annual UK rate of growth well beyond the average for the pj;st decade.    Compare this fourteen per centshare of Community GDP with our expected twentyfour per cent share ofcontributions, and the Community is faced with an unacceptable situation.I have enquired how the Community thought that this problem should be dealt with when it was raised during the entry negotiations.As I understand it, it was argued first that the problem would not bess bad as our negotiators had suggested, and second that the Communitywuld be developing new policies in a number of fields where Communityexpenditure would be of net benefit to Britain, and that that benefitrould come to balance the expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy,Men is admitted to be of greater advantage to other member states.Iam not suggesting that there will not be a new Community policy.But I ask my colleagues to consider whether there is now any realisticpossibility that new Community policies will,be developed on a scaleMen might even begin to balance a British net contribution of three-hundred to three hundred and fifty million units of account in 1975 orfivehundred and fifty to sixhundred million in 1977* still less seven-hundred to eighthundred million in 1980. HTo make this calculation you have not only to say what new policies involving new expenditures are likely to be approved, but totear in mind that, with the British contribution as high as it will be,the British return from such Community policies would have to be very high indeed for our net receipts to be substantial.    I see no possibilityof the Council moving in the direction of a Community Budget of the sizeMen would be required.The fact is that, in respect of the Community Budget, theBsgotiated terms of entry were fundamentally inequitable.    Experiencesince then has reinforced that judgment.    I now put it to the council that it is inequitable for the Community that the United Kingdom, with the low-average GDP per head, should be obliged to make massive resource/transfers to otherk
transfers to other members of the Community, including those withabove-average GDP per head, through the Community Budget, and equallythat it is inequitable that the British gross contribution should rise from the thirteen decimal five percent next year to over twentyfour percent in 1980 while our share of Community GDP is estimated on the basisof recent forecasts to be fourteen per cent in the latter year.I. know that the Council devoted long and arduous work to con-structing the &quot;own resources&quot; system of financing the Community budget and that this system has been approved by the Parliaments of all thethe Member States.    I know that the Council would prefer to find a wayof dealing with the problem which would not change or overturn the&quot;own resources&quot; decision of April 1970.   We are certainly prepared toconsider solutions that would meet the wishes of the Council in thismatter.   But I would ask that the Council should also meet us.    I wouldremind you that the Community declared to Britain during the courseof the entry negotiations that, if &quot;unacceptable situations&quot; should arise, &quot;the very survival of the Community would demand that the institutions find equitable solutions&quot;.   My Government believes that wehave such a situation.But we also believe that, if the political will to do so is there, the Council could find a number of different ways of bringing about an equitable solution - that is, one which will produce a fair balance of advantage for the UK as for other member states.I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to putforward any specific proposal.   But one way of proceeding would be tomake a direct adjustment on the expenditure side, which would correct the imbalance to which I have drawn attention.   This could be done inaccordance with a principle of equity to be agreed in the Community,leaving the method of financing the Community Budget untouched.   Apossible principle might be based on the. re cognition that a member state with below-average GBP per^. head should be accorded appropriate treatment in respect of resource transfers under the Community Budget.   Such asystem might avoid the tendency to promote divergence rather thanconvergence.    It could also be self-correcting in the sense that the adjustments required would   become smaller as the dimensions of amember state&apos;s problem diminished.    I recognise that this is not theonly way of dealing with the problem, but it would have the great advantage of simplicity and that could be specially beneficial in handling an issue which is urgent.I would also like to add that there are two technical points ofsome importance which arise from an interpretation of the financial arrangements governing the budget and could lead in our view to results which would be adverse to the UK.   We shall want to be sure that these can be resolved, in an acceptable manner.Finally, I would like to stress three points:-   First, we are not asking for a solution which amounts to a special regime for the UK alone.Anyisystem should apply to all members.    It is in the interest of every country to find a solution that takes account of the economic differences between member states and thus helps to promote economic convergence.&quot;Second, if an essential requirement of our renegotiation is to bemet, we must ask the Community to find such a solution, and so overcome the problem of inequity which the budget presents to us./Thirdly,
Thirdly, I have refrained from proposing a solution definite toe Council, but from what I have said it is clear that possibilitiesist which could be adopted within the Treaties.,i Mr President, I conclude this section by saying once again that budget problem is a problem for the Community - and I ask that Ituld be dealt with expeditiously.The criticism of the CAP has been particularly strong in Britainth because we are a large importer of food, and because membershipthe ESC has weakened our ties with our traditional suppliers.   Iuld therefore like to indicate the nature of our problems and ouroad objectives, leaving to Mr Peart the elaboration of more detailedoposals in the Council of Agricultural Ministers.Despite our strong criticisms we recognise that for Europeanrmers the CAP has achieved much, and that in addition to the benefitshas brought them, it can provide an assurance of supplies at knownices in a world where both price and availability can be unpredictable,e question therefore is whether, without overthrowing the system,itish interests as a large consumer can be accommodated to theinciples of Community preference free circulation of goods, andmmunity financing.   Provided some major changes are made, we believeat it would be possible to do so.   We recognise that some of thefects of the CAP have been due to factors unrelated to agriculture,ch as the complexity of the arrangements that have to be made where,rrencies within the Community change their relative values.The major areas in which the UK wishes to secure improvementse as follows:First, the cost of the CAP should be reduced in real terms,is calls for the establishment of firm criteria on which price policybased, and for support mechanisms to be operated and with greaterect.   We wish to see agricultural support maintained at realisticels, and we accept that the aim of the Community should be to producemuch of our food requirements as we can provide efficiently andnomically.   I emphasise the last part of that sentence as much asfirst, for as large importers it is in our interests that pricesuld be determined with closer reference to the costs of the moreicient producers and to the supply/demand situation for particularodities.   The CAP should aim to gear its policy to the modern ifarm,the Commission itself has advocated.   Such a policy would createficulty for special groups of less viable farmers and it would beessary to consider special provision for them.    Indeed, some of theirblems might be looked after better in the context of social andional policy.    On another aspect, there should be more recognitionpresent circumstances of the disparities which actually exist betweenlets in different parts of the Community.    In our view it would be full on occasion and. for particular commodities if there was a rightseek directly a measure of differential pricing.    In practice thisoccur now as the indirect effect of the systems of compensatoryfcunts.   The exercise of such a right would not be intended to breakprinciple of common prices: the right would be exercised subject to normal procedure for reaching agreement during annual priceerminations./A stricter
A stricter price policy would need to be reinforced by improvements in the intervention and levy mechanisms so as to discourage costlysurplus production, by a greater readiness to use direct productionaids where it makes financial and economic sense to do so, and bystrengthening financial controls and costing in general.Next, we are concerned to secure speedy improvements in the marketing regimes for some major commodities.   We know that theCommission shares our dissatisfaction with existing operations andwe shall take full account of the proposals it will put forward.   Butthere is a need, for quick action, as the beef sector is demonstratingat this&apos; moment.    It does not make sense to take large quantities of fresh beef off the market, freeze it, put it in store then watch theprice of the remainder go up, to be followed in turn by a fall in theamount the housewife buys.   In the end neither producer nor consumerbenefits.   We would be ready to consider as an alternative a combination of measures, such as slaughter premiums related to reasonable market prices, national or Community production aids, and&apos;a realistic importpolicy, which together would reduce the need for intervention to aminimum.Finally, I want to stress the importance we attach to theCommunity&apos;s trading relationship with the rest of the world.   we recognise that since our earlier criticisms were made three years ago,world prices for most agricultural commodities are much higher thanthey were then.    It is likely (but not absolutely certain) that there&apos;?;ill be a closer relationship between Community and world prices thanin the past.   We can turn this to our advantage for it gives theCommunity the opportunity to ensure that whatever the future movement;of world prices, the CAP must not become an instrument:-&apos; of excessiveprotectionism or a threat to world trade through the generation and disposal of surpluses.   The changes we propose would do much to ensurethat, and to provide for a better balance between the interests of producers, consumers and taxpayers in the Community.There is a strong case for improved terms of access for manykinds of foodstuffs from countries outside the Community some of whichwe do not even produce.   This could be done without detriment to community producers.   There is need- for a clear commitment to a positive approach in the international trade negotiations now in progress,and we shall put forward our views to the Community as soon as itresumes consideration of the question.   More specifically, we also needsatisfactory and continuing arrangements for Commonwealth sugar, which provide for adequate access linked to assurances of supply at pricesfairly and realistically related to the Community&apos;s own price structure.Similarly we shall need satisfactory and continuing arrangements for new Zealand and we would wish to bring forward the review of thearrangements envisaged in Protocol fi 8 of the Treaty of Accession to thecurrent year.   As regards sugar, we remain firmly committed to theoffer of access on fair terms for at least one decimal four million tons from the developing countries of the Commonwealth after the CSAexpires.   We shall be putting forward our proposals on sugar in thediscussions about the Community&apos;s internal sugar regime and this willhave a bearing on the Protocol 22 negotiations, to which I shall come in a minute./We attach
We attach the greatest importance to an early examination of allthese important matters with a view to finding adequate solutions.It is our view that everything I have suggested is compatible with the basic principles of the GAP and with the Treaties, and would provebeneficial to everyone in the enlarged Community, as well as to the 5rest of the world.TRADE AND AIDThis leads to the question of the trade of Commonwealth and developing countries.   The need to offer a fair deal to Communityconsumers of food as well as to overseas suppliers has important implications both for the developed Commonwealth and the developingworld.   The problems in this sector fall into five main groups.a -(iThe first concerns the developed Commonwealth countries.    Theproblems which, they face over access to the Community are mainly inagriculture and here I have already outlined our approach, as totariffs, in the case of a small number of products for example somecanned goods of importance we wish to see an extension of tariffquotas.   More generally, and as a permanent solution, the Community&apos;sdetailed negotiating directive for the multilateral trade negotiationsnow under way should include an offer - subject naturally to reciprocity- to malce substantial reductions of the tariff on these products aswell as on certain industrial products of some importance to thesecountries.The second group are the associable Commonwealth countries which under Protocol 22 have been offered the possibility of association withthe Community.   These negotiations offer the best chance of meeting theinterests of these countries, including the interest of many of themin sugar, provided that certain important points are met.   For example,I refer to the need for free entry for industrial products, and also togenerous treatment of agricultural products, including, if necessary,tariff and levy-free quotas for agricultural products.   It is also important that the Community should respect the developing countries&apos;wish to avoid trade reciprocity.In the discussions that have begun within the Community aboutthe Commission^ negotiating mandate, we shall seek these objectives.Then there is the question of aid.    Here, as my colleague, Mrs Hart,recently explained to the Development Council, we want an evolution of community policies which will take into account the needs not only ofthe associated countries, but of developing countries throughout, theworld.   We look for a more balanced distribution of Community aidaccording to need and have in mind particularly the countries of SouthAsia who are among those hardest hit by the increase in oil andcommodity prices.    I am glad that in this matter the Commission hastaken up our proposal and are preparing an aid framework coveringpossible commitments over the next five years.We shall wish in addition to see these Asian countries accordedgenerous treatment both through the implementation of the Declarationof Intent and through a substantial improvement in the Community^Generalised Preference Scheme.    I recognise that the Community was thefirst to introduce a generalised preference scheme, and that some other important countries have not.   But the Community&apos;s scheme embodiesrestrictions which greatly limit its practical value to the developing countries and which are difficult to defend at a time when many of these/countries face
countries face severe balance of payments problems as a result of theincrease in oil prices.   We must aim at the progressive abolition of these!various restrictions over several years, recognising that there willhave to be safeguards to deal with cases of material injury or threat of it in one or more member states and there might have to be special arrangements for textiles.   We also need to see the scheme&apos;s coverageextended in the area of processed agricultural products.   Further itseems to us unreasonable for India and Bangladesh to be disadvahtaged.in the UK market for jute and coir in the period during which theCommunity tariff is being lowered.   And we need substantial improvementin the position of Hong Kong where at present the UK has to discriminate against one of its own territories.   These issues will be for dis-rcussion in the Community&apos;s review of the generalised scheme of preferences.   But I speak of these today to indicate that a substantial improvement in the present scheme is necessary not simply in our own interests but as a token of the responsibility which the Communityshares for the future of the developing world.REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL POLICYThere is one further question, namely the powers which we recognise to be able to pursue effective regional and industrialpolicies.   The British Government consider that we recognise new policies to stimulate industry in order to arrest and reverse ourrelative industrial decline and these will entail interventionistmeasures that are systematic end comprehensive.   We recognise the valueof rules within the Community to ensure that one country, in attempting to solve its   own problems, does not create problems for the others.,and in strengthening our industrial system we certainly have no intentionof damaging the economic and commercial interests of other member states.But we fear that our plans for British industry, including the steelindustry, may be hampered by unduly restrictive interpretations of the.treaties, and, as part of &apos;the renegotiation, we shall seek assurances that our fears on this score can be set at rest.   I would hope thatconstructive exploratory talks with the Commission can begin as soon aspossible to ascertain the impact of the treaties.Linked with this is the question of regional aids, which a working party convened by the Commission has begun to study.   As I said on1 April, we accept that co-ordination of the rules under which each of us gives and has a.useful part to play.   We are taking part in the workand we intend to make a full contribution to it.    Our objective willbe to ensure that the rules take account of the needs of the UK and of -the policies we devise to meet those needs.   We are conscious that the regional problems of member states are different - some areagricultural, some are caused by sheer remoteness and others like ourown by changes in industrial structure.   The rules must therefore bebroad enough in scope to cover all types of aid that may be required.In our experience, they will need to be flexible and capable of modifica-tion.   It will be necessary from time to time for us to vary the levelof aids, the definition of areas.   Where particular problems arise,such as steel closures, we may also need to exceed whatever fixedceilings are agreed.   We welcome the Commission&apos;s statement that theremay be derogations in these circumstances, but the problem may arise in other cases and the new rules should take account of this, as wellas of the need to react quickly to particular regional and industrialproblems as they arise.   These matters are essential to us as an element of the renegotiation.   We plan to do this by securing a satisfactory out-come in the working party./GENERAL POLICY
GEN3RAL policy have outlined the four main issues which we ask the Council to pursue and also have proposed methods for proceeding with them.   Webelieve that our case speaks for itself.    Some of the problems v/e have raised naturally affect us more than they do some other members.   Someother issues could be dealt with and would bring benefit to other membersof the Community.    But whether they affect us alone or whether they\affect the Community as a whole there can be no doubt that they- are[real problems.   None has been manufactured.    There is nothing contrivedabout them.    There is a solid case for what we are proposing, and wellook to the Community to examine these matters on their merits.    In thatI spirit the UK will work for an early and successful result for these renegotiations.I do not understand some of the comments I have heard, not utteredaround this table, that we are not in earnest in trying to seek a successful solution.    I can only say that if the UK was negotiating inorder to achieve a negative answer and a breakdown I would not go about1 presenting our case in the thorough way we have chosen in addition toplaying our full part in the ongoing work of the Community and in proposing solutions that can be reached without disrupting the treaties.If the negotiations are successful and they secure the approval of theBritish people we shall be ready to play our full part in constructinga new Europe.Once renegotiation is complete, HMG will form a view on v/hetherthe needs of Britain have been met.    In submitting the results of the renegotiation to the British people, we shall make clear our verdicton what has been achieved.I fully realise that there is a long way to go before such adecision can be taken but we^ shall accept our responsibilities inthis matter.In April I referred to our readiness&apos;to intensify politicalconsultation and co-operation provided that v/e could agree on our mainaims.   One of the issues I had in mind was the question of European/American relations.    It seems to me that there is some hopeful evidencefollowing the useful exchanges which we &apos;had at Schloss Gymnich that v/eshall now be able to proceed with our work in a way which will promotesteadily improving European/American relations.   Consultation, co-operation and co-ordination between Europe and the United States shouldbe as natural as breathing.    In our view it is essential.    It remainsour ohjective.   What is happening in this field encourages us to^1 go further in these matters not only with the US but with other countries and regions too.    In a world which is grouping itself increasingly intoregions it cannot be disadvantageous for Community members to discussaeong themselves how they can act together in the world in political as well as in economic matters.   We adhere to the view that some of themost important problems of the world will only be solved in a worldcontext but the Community if it is properly organised has the capacity to contribute to the solution./To sum up the
To sum up the Community is at cross-roads in its history.The problems raised by Britain today are only one of a number ofI issues that cloud the Community1 s future.   Quite distinct andI separate from the problems I have been discussing is the feeling thatI there exists among Community members a diminished unity of purpose,fa growing divergence in our economies and a readiness to seekInationalist solutions to problems that demand common and joint action.AH these things make me fearful for the future, welfare of our people.I The countries that make up the Community need to make a fresh start,land this can be done if all partners in the enterprise feel that their difficulties are understood,  their case for changes is recognisedland remedied and that the Community can respond to their needs.    I haveino doubt that this can be done if the will exists.    Let us together(put these matters right and when we do then the Community will beI once again strengthened to play a constructive part in the affairs ofpBurope and in bringing its influence to bear on the problems of theI world.
COMMONWEALTH ATTITUDES TO UK MEMBERSHIP OP THE EECMy colleagues may be interested in the following summary accountof Commonwealth attitudes, based on the most up-to-date information available.   This information derives in part from the exploratory bi-lateral talks about food supplies which have taken place, with Canada,Australia and New Zealand-and with the Commonwealth sugar producers,partly from the comments I have received from our High commissioners in Commonwealth countries in response to my request for information onattitudes there, and partly from conversations I and other members ofthe Government have had with Ministers in Commonwealth Governments,for example when Mr Manley of Jamaica was here and when the Secretaryof State for Trade was in Ottawa. -2.     It would be misleading to speak of a &quot;Commonwealth attitude&quot;since there are so many different countries involved, with differentinterests and different preoccupations.   But there is enough evidence to draw the following general conclusions, which apply to the devel-oped as well as to the developing Commonwealth and to the countrieseligible for association with the Community as well as to those whichare not.   These conclusions are:(a) Earlier Commonwealth apprehensions about the consequences of our e.c. membership have diminished.    Commonwealth coun-. tries accept as a fact of international life both the exis-tence of the e.c. and our membership of it.   I did not askfor their views on whether or not we should remain in mem-membership but they are not actively seeking to undo what hasbeen done.(b) Commonwealth countries do not show an interest in returning to traditional patterns of economic relationship with the uk.   They are out to sell their exports where it is mostprofitable, regardless of the political and cultural tieswhich they continue to have (and in many cases to cherish)with Britain and with the rest of the Commonwealth.(c) Many Commonwealth countries think that the wider e.c. marketwill be more important for them in the future (if it is notat present) than the British market. They therefore attach importance to securing improved access to the market of the eight, which they expect to result from our membership ofthe Community. They believe that we are a useful ally tothem in the Community&apos;s internal discussions. n(d) The potential associates seek trade advantages in Europe anda share of the European development fund.    Some of them indi-cated that they would continue to seek association whetheror not we were members of the e.c..3.     In the case of some countries this general attitude would nodoubt change if we fail to secure special arrangements to safeguardcertain important sectors of their trade.   Of these the most important is sugar, where the UK is still expected to honour the Lancaster Houseassurances that we will secure from the Community access for 1.4/million
million tons of sugar from the developing Commonwealth at fair prices.Another special case where a specific trade sector needs protectionis Botswana beef, the arrangements for which are currently the subjectof discussion in Brussels.   Our task is to protect Commonwealth inter-ests in sensitive fields such as these and to ensure that the Commun-ity maintains and improves the trade terms available to the rest ofthe Commonwealth, developed and developing.    If we succeed in this itseems likely that the Commonwealth would not regard it as in their interest for us to withdraw -from the Community.   Once their essentialeconomic interests have been safeguarded then from their point of view it is better to have a strong British voice speaking for them than a community without Britain whose, policies would be likely to be domin-ated by the French and others who would pay less heed to Commonwealthpreoccupations.4.     Clearly this is in no way conclusive for membership from theBritish angle, but we should not look for rejoicing from our&apos; fellowCommonwealth members if we withdraw.5.     I attach a summary setting out the current attitudes of all commonwealth countries as far as we can ascertain them.2
ANNEXCOMMONWEALTH ATTITUDES TO UK MEMBERSHIP OP THE e.c.:COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY ANALYSISOLD COMMONWEALTHCanada1,    As Canadian Ministers recently explained to Mr Shore, theCanadian Government &quot;believe thata. British membership will make the e.c. more outward looking andmore stable;b. inside the Community we would be a stronger trading partnerfor Canada;c   we would be helpful over Canada&apos;s own future trading relationswith the Community, ie the UK is regarded as a &quot;friend atcourt&quot; within the EEC2,    The potential for expanded UK/Canada trade would not be seriously affected by our continued membership of the EEC3,    The Canadians have largely come to terms with the community as it is at present, helped by the relatively favourable termssecured on accession for a number of products of special interest to canada (eg mineral and forest products).lw    Nevertheless Canadians would like the CAP gradually reformed topresent less of a hurdle to competitive Canadian exports.     And inthe GATT multilateral trade negotiations they hope for EECconcessions on manufactured goods of interest to Canada.Australia5.     The effect of our entry on the Australian economy has beennegligible.     Pears however exist of permanent damage to exportprospects of some minor commodities (notably fresh and canned fruits)as we phase in the CAP.     In future, Australia, as a major goodexporter, would like to see the e.c. less dedicated to self-sufficiency.She would like better and assured access for food exports to Europe,which would require amendment of the CAP.6.     Our accession to the e.c. emphasised changing relations between britain and Australia, but major changes had already been takingplace quite independently and are likely to continue whether or not we remain in the Community.7i.     The Australians now see the enlarged Community as one of theirmajor trading partners, especially for wool and increasingly forother raw materials, and it is her biggest supplier of imports.8.     The e.c. and Australia1s relations with Britain were notimportant issues in the recent election campaign./New Zealand1
New Zealand9.     New Zealand&apos;s agricultural exports to the UK in 1973 were notin practice adversely affected by our entry into the e.c..     Theeffects of future membership will depend largely on the outcome ofreview of the special arrangements for exports to the UK of dairyproduce provided for in Protocol 18 of the Treaty of Accession, towhich New Zealand continues to attach great importance.     The NewZealanders would probably welcome guaranteed volume entryarrangements on a longer term basis, but would be unlikely to offeradvantageous price terms in return for guaranteed access (for whichthey would regard guarantees on supply as an adequate quid pro quo).10.     The New Zealanders are now relaxed about the possible futureEEC sheepmeat regulation and see little likely attraction in any longterm arrangement for access to the UK market.africa the Gambia11,     e.c. membership has not so far had major consequences one way or another for the Gambians, largely because the terms of accessionreasonably safeguarded their limited interest.12. In seeking association, the Gambians are concerned primarily to ensure the market for groundnuts and to gain access to e.c. aid.For the latter-reason they will pursue association whether Britaincontinues as a member or not.13.     The Gambians greatly value the continued British presence in Community councils, from which they expect to benefit whenparticular Gambian interests are at stake.Ghana1k.     British membership of the e.c. has so far had little effect onGhanaian exports (at present largely unprocessed raw materials).They are concerned about prospects for semi-manufactures and manufactures.     Their objective is to secure in Protocol 22negotiations a regime which does not affect trade with important non-e.c. markets, especially the United States and Japan.     They aretherefore adamantly opposed to reverse preferences,f . &quot;.&quot;&apos;!(- &apos;!! &apos;Lesotho15.     Lesotho value the assistance we have been able to give to the african countries seeking association.     For Lesotho, associationmeans access to the EDF, the possibility of outlets for export^potential still to be developed,; and diversification of Internationalconnexions generally.Mauritius16,     The Mauritians generally have long held the view that britain should be a member of the e.c., for both economic and political/reasons2
reasons.     They have historical connexions with hoth the UK and france and regard it as natural that both should be members of thesame Community.     They do not see British membership as weakingbilateral UK/Mauritius links or as inhibiting development of commonwealth institutions.17.     Mauritius&apos; economic interests lie almost exclusively in securing satisfactory arrangements for the marketing of sugar fromdeveloping Commonwealth countries in the enlarged Community.18,     Mauritius would almost certainly wish to be associated withthe e.c. whether the UK is a member or not.Swaziland19.     The Swazis, though suspicious by nature,-do not see british membership of the e.c. as affecting their relationship with britain in any human or political sense.     Economically, the Swazis hope thatthrough us, they can safeguard their exports to Britain, open widermarkets in Europe, while maintaining their bilateral aid from the,UKand getting additional aid from the EDF.20.     The Swazis regard Britain as &quot;a friend at court&quot; in Brussels,particularly over the difficult problem of reconciling Swaziassociation with Europe and their customs relationship with SouthAfrica.Tanzania21.     The Tanzanians do not appear to see adverse implications forbilateral or Commonwealth relations from British membership.     their main interest is to retain their market in e.c. countries for primaryexports of cotton, sisal, coffee and tea.     Membership has not to.date diminished the volume of exports of these commodities to the UK,or otherwise affected Tanzania.     They have made no proposals abouthow their market in Europe should be guaranteed in the long term norsuggested any alteration in any aspect of the Community.     They are opposed to reciprocity in the Protocol 22 negotiations and look forward through association to access on the easiest possible terms to the EDP.Zambia- it22.     The Zambian attitude to UK membership is conditioned by theiroverriding interest in copper which provides over 90% of their foreign exchange earnings.     The effect of British membership todate is therefore marginal since neither the UK nor the e.c. imposetariff or other restrictions on copper imports.23.     They would like association, but have not given this high priority./Sierra Leone3
Sierra Leone2k*     British membership of the e.c. has had virtually no effect onSierra Leone&apos;s material interests (her main exports are minerals)nor her relations with the UK.     She enjoys cordial and profitablerelations with Britain, the German Federal Republic, France and Italy.Sierra Leone would not wish any weakening of these bilateral linksand sees association with the e.c. as strengthening them.Kenya25.     During enlargement negotiations the Kenyans consulted us aboutthe likely consequence and concluded that basic Kenya exports(coffee, tea, pyrethrum and sisal) would be unaffected by UK entry.Conversely, if we withdrew, Kenyans would expect no change in thesituation,26.     Kenya&apos;s main interests now are that an association agreement should give right of entry for manufactured goods, for which Kenyahopes in the future to develop export markets in the Community, andto obtain a good cut of the EDF.27.     Kenyans believe that UK membership has already improved theattitude of the Community towards both associates and associables.They claim that francophones have commented similarly.Botswana28.     UK membership is not, in the short term, to the economic advantage of Botswana, though Botswana sees association as an assetin their policy of lessening their political and economic dependence on South Africa.29.     Botswana&apos;s main concern is to preserve the market for beefexports which existed in the UK before enlargement.     The HighCommissioner was told recently of Botswana&apos;s concern thatrenegotiation should not weaken Britain&apos;s ability to assist Botswanaover association.30.     UK membership has had no discernible effect on Malawi so far.There have been no public statements about Malawi&apos;s own negotiationswith the e.c. or about the implications of UK membership.     Associatedstatus is seen as Malawi&apos;s best option.     Tobacco is the onlycommodity causing Malawi concern.Uganda31.     The Uganda Governments thinking on the e.c. is unformed andunsophisticated.     Uganda is keen to see the Protocol 22 negotiationscompleted, but none of her current exports are really affected.     UKmembership of the e.c. has thus had little impact so far and is unlikely to affect our relations with Uganda./Nigeria
Nigeria32.     When entry negotiations &quot;began, the Nigerians regarded them as afurther demonstration that Britain was turning her back on theCommonwealth.     They dismissed the suggestion that Nigeria&apos;s interestcould be adequately safeguarded by adherence to a new YaoundS-styleConvention.     Their attitude has since changed and the Nigeriansnow see association negotiations as a way in which the Africans,through unity, may obtain a new and advantageous relationship with europe.     This broad political objective is more important thandetailed economic arrangements.     A good deal of Nigerian politicalcapital is by now invested in the Protocol 22 negotiations.33,     UK membership of the e.c. is likely to have little economicimpact on Nigeria since oil (which enters the Community duty free)accounts for well over three quarters of Nigeria&apos;8 exports.     Ifassociation negotiations are concluded satisfactorily, Nigeria shouldnot feel any adverse economic effects.3k.     If the UK withdrew from the e.c. the Nigerians would probablycontinue to seek some kind of economic relationship with theCommunity while also seeking arrangements to enable the maintenanceof Nigeria&apos;s position in the UK market.35.     The Nigerians accept the e.c. as a fact of international lifewith which it should be possible to come to satisfactory terms.There is no indication that the Nigerians want to see the e.c. assuch altered.CARIBBEANGuyana36.     UK membership of the Community has so far had little effecton Guyana,     She wishes to associate with the e.c. whether the UKis a member or not.     Her objectives in the Protocol 22 negotiationsremain as defined by the Guyana Foreign Minister, Mr Ramphal, onbehalf of the Caribbean associables at Brussels on 26 July 1973*She has no apprehensions over UK renegotiation; neither UKmembership nor her withdrawal present the Caribbean with problems that cannot be overcome.Jamaica37.     Over the past five years Jamaica has become progressivelyreconciled to UK membership of the e.c..     She decided to seekassociation in the hope that preferential arrangements unwelcome tothe Americans could be avoided and in order to secure continuedsatisfactory access to Europe for, in particular, sugar and bananasat remunerative prices.&apos;38. She expects Britain to honour the Lancaster House assuranceson sugar or, if she leaves the Community to continue to provide asatisfactory outlet for sugar and bananas, though Jamaica would notbe ready to put the clock back and accept commodity arrangements asrigid as the CSA. Indeed in bilateral negotiations she might wellpress the UK for higher prices than she might be prepared to acceptfrom Europe.. 5 /39.
39,     Jamaica has adjusted to the fact of UK membership.     If Britainleft, Jamaica would not necessarily cease her attempt to associatewith the e.c..Bahamas1+0.     The Bahamians do not- think that UK membership of the e.c. neednecessarily weaken the ties between the UK and the Commonwealth,There have been no economic ill effects for the Bahamas from EECmembership to date,     Bahamas&apos; principal concern in associationnegotiations is to secure satisfactory arrangements for rum exports.Barbados1+1.     British membership of the e.c. has had little impact on Barbados.Her initial misgivings about UK entry have been allayed by the concernwhich both major British political parties have shown to ensure that commonwealth Caribbean agricultural products, in particular&apos; sugar,continue to enjoy a favourable market in the Community.     Barbadosis now reasonably confident that she will not suffer as a resultof accession.     Indeed she thinks that she may well derive somebenefit, particularly from EDF aid resulting from association.Trinidad1+2.     Trinidad has long accepted UK membership as a fact of life towhich she must accommodate.     There has been little recent public or private comment.       Trinidad1s lack of interest can perhaps be explained by the fact that her trade with e.c. countries, includingthe UK, is. relatively less important than trade with other areas ofthe world,     (Petroleum products account for over 80% of Trinidad&apos;sexports, with the US and Sweden the principal markets.)1+3.     Trinidad, though having relatively less at stake, is ready togo along with association with the e.c. for the sake of Caribbeanunity, while critical of her Caribbean colleagues&apos; emphasis on sugar,which Trinidad&apos;s Prime Minister has described as &quot;the crop ofcolonialism par excellence&quot;,PACIFICTonga, Western Samoakk*     Both Tonga and Western Samoa are intent on pursuing associatedstatus and securing free and unlimited entry for copra and, in thecase of Samoa, also cocoa,Fiji1+5.     Piji&apos;s attitude is mainly coloured by the effects on her mainexport, sugar. .  There is concern to obtain access for sugar andcoconut oil on the best terms, ideally (for sugar) through the equivalent of the CSA in Europe combined.with e.c. participation in anew international sugar agreement.     Fiji is also concerned aboutwhether our membership, and our contribution to the EDF, may mean lessbilateral aid and less aid through such agencies as the WorldSecretariat and the UK Development programme/ASIA6
ASIASingaporei+6.     Singapore Ministers consider that any loss of commercialadvantage for Singapore goods (eg canned pineapple) in the UKresulting from British membership would he small and more than&quot;balanced by hopes for improvement in opportunities for Singaporeexports to the enlarged e.c..Singapore would like to see a strong outward-looking europe as a political and economic counter-weight in SE Asia to the superpowers, Japan and China.     To this end Singapore has set out tocultivate the e.c..     Singapore&apos;s trade with the rest of western europe is now substantially greater than with the UK.     She wouldnot expect trade either with us or with other European countries tobe significantly affected by UK withdrawal.Sri Lanka1+8.     Sri Lanka so far has been virtually unaffected by UKmembership of the e.c. as her main existing exports to the UK enterduty free.     But, for the future, she fears competition from EECassociates.u10.     At the time of accession the Ceylonese felt they had securedless good a deal than some other Commonwealth countries.     But theyhave been reasonably encouraged by concessions subsequentlynegotiated and by the support they have had from the UK.     They nowsee continental Europe, particularly Germany, rather than the UK,as the main potential growth market for their long-traditional export markets.India50.     The Indians were originally worried about UK entry, but sinceenlargement, India&apos;s links with the e.c. have been strengthenedwithout consequent weakening of links with the UK.     Some erosion ofIndia&apos;s traditional exports to the UK due to the loss of the margin of preference and imposition of tariffs on a few items seems inevitable.     But in general, the Indians believe that it would bedifficult to put the clock back.     And in any case, they think theyhave good prospects of expanding their exports to the UK and therest of the Community, especially if we are in the Community andtherefore able to help in safeguarding their position as we have done so far:    they realise our value as a friend at court.51.     The Indians welcomed Mrs Hart&apos;s statement on 30 April about/the Community aid policy.     They recognised the important role played by the UK in widening European horizons.Bangladesh52.     There is no disposition on the part of Bangalee   leaders tosuggest that our accession presents a serious threat to the special/links-7
links with the UK.     They accept the argument that they are likelyto find Britain a more useful friend as a leading &quot;European&quot;.53.     They attach importance to the Community1s implementations of aJoint Declaration of Intent.     They admit that so far HMG has donewell for them, particularly in ensuring the maintenance of the jutetrade, where Bangladesh now enjoys access to wider markets than she can at present fully exploit.     She looks to British influence tosecure Community food aid and hope we shall he able to continue toback tariff increases on jute.Malaysia5U.     There is no vestige of Commonwealth trade ideals remaining inMalaysia, merely self-interest in securing the entry of Malaysiangoods into the markets of the Nine.     She is keen to .secure further improvements in the GSP.     But Malaysian exports &quot;are booming and theMalaysians are little concerned about the effects of accession.55.     Malaysia still values ties with the UK in the educational andpolitical fields, but in the economic and commercial sphere sheregards the UK as just one of a number of trading partners.     she would not wish to return to a position of heavy dependence on tradewith the UK.8
