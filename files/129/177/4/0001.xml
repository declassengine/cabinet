IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT9,1C(74) 54 COPY NO       5 *22 May 1974jCABINETNURSES, TEACHERS AND POST OFFICE WORKERS pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EC) consideredyesterday the pay claims of the nurses, teachers and Post Office workers.This memorandum sets out the conclusions which the Committee reached,subject to endorsement by the Cabinet.2, The factual background is given in the report by officials which isattached to this paper.    The Committee agreed that the strength of feeling among the nurses and the merits of their case made it essential to offer some concession, and that if this were done it would be difficult to withhold similar concessions for the teachers and the Post Office workers,among whom pressure was likely to rise in any case in the next few weeks.Some members of the Committee were worried about the inflationaryconsequences of the concessions, which could be serious; but on balancewe thought that we would stand a better chance of getting a voluntary policyproperly launched if these three difficult public service cases were dealtwith before the meeting of the Trades Union Congress in September.3. The Committee agreed therefore that independent reviews for the nurses and the teachers should be allowed on the lines proposed in theattached paper (paragraphs 6 and 7 and 14 and 15 - save that retrospectionshould be allowed as below).    The review for the nurses would be bestundertaken by the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB), providedthat this is acceptable to the Staff Side and the Review Body,    The review for the teachers would probably be best undertaken by an ad hoc body,preferably a single body to cover England, Wales and Scotland,    Interimpayments would not be granted.    In the case of the nurses, the resultingsettlement would be made retrospective to the date of the announcement ofthe review.    No decision was taken on retrospection for the teachers.The Post Office workers are already negotiating, and they would be told that the resulting settlement could be implemented after the end of thestatutory controls, but not backdated before that.1
4.        The Secretary of State for Social Services would have liked to saythat the DDRB would be free to recommend interim payments for the nurses, if the Review Body felt that the situation warranted it; but thegeneral feeling in the Committee was that the repercussions of this wouldbe dangerous and that the payments that all three groups will get underthreshold agreements should make such a concession unnecessary.5.        The Committee agreed that, subject to consultation with the staff side, the review for the nurses should be announced in the debate in theHouse of Commons on Thursday 23 May.    The way in which the &quot;arrangements for the other two cases would be announced will need further consideration, but action will have to be taken quickly.D treasury Chambers22 May 1974 f*2

The Durnham Committeeeets. on 24 May to start negotiations on the offer of improvements.,n pay for teachers in schools in areas of social deprivation.The nurses have pressed for an urgent independent enquiry,robably taking 6-9 months,  failing which they intend to give ,ratice to end their contracts with the nhs. ? The Government haveiromised an answer in the week beginning 3 June1&apos;.    Meanwhile,  thelurses have also advanced a claim for a substantial interimlayment - one union says  100 million - and&apos; have refused tolegotiate on the offer for pay improvements related to the Driggs. .proposals..    An Opposition motion on NHS pay will be debated oh&apos;3 May and it is desirable to make an announcement on nurses&apos;  pay ;efore then. &quot; &apos; &apos;it    The immediate question therefore is what reply should beiiven to the nurses. ;&apos;    - -    - - &apos;&apos;v&apos; 1(confide ntiaQ
NURSES6.      DHSS believethat the minimum-concessions needed are: -v.;-aj    immediate agreement to set up an early independent enquiry;b.    The enquiry to be held without predetermined limitations on the cost of implementing its findings.    If conducted by the. Doctors&apos;  and Dentists&apos;  Review Body (DDRB)  as suggested below the Government should give the usualundertaking which applies to DDRE recommendations -namely to accept them unless there are clear andcompelling reasons for not doing so.    If the inquiryis conducted otherwise,  decision on its conclusionswould be for the parties to determine at the time.1eV The date^of implementing the recommendations to be offered initially as the date of completion of the inquiry or November 197^; whichever is earlier but ifabsolutely necessary,  the date to be taken back to theend of statutory controls in July.     (The Secretary ofState for Social Services may wish to go back further.)The nurses are now also asking for a substantial interim payment on account.    The arguments against this seem to be overwhelmingand the threshold increases will in effect be an interimpayment -&apos;though the nurses may not consider this sufficient.7. The terms of reference might follow the precedent of the:most recent independent enquiry into1 nurses&apos;&quot; pay (carried outby NBPI in 1967/8) :&apos;&quot;to examine the pay structure and&apos; the levels of remuneration and related conditions of service&apos; of nurses andimidwives.covered by the Nurses and Midwives Whitley Council withparticular reference, to the current claim&quot;!.,&apos; &apos;This would have the presentational advantage of ranging beyondpay but not going beyond the competence of the kind, of, body &apos;;;which could look .atpay,.  ; .    i    ,f   &apos;  &apos; .....      .... -8. It would be advantageous to use an existing body for theenquiry, so as to forestall criticism of having an entirely adhoc approach. The DDRB would be the most appropriate body andwe recommend that Lord Halsbury be approached to see whether hewould undertake the task, if necessary by setting up a specialpanel of the DDRB with some women members; or, ifthis were not acceptable, whether he would chair a separate enquiry, perhapsincluding some members drawn from the DDRB.9.      We cannot forecast the cost of an enquiry&apos;s findings, butit might be  75 -  110 million a year (ie lk%-20% on the nurses&apos;current pay bill.)
(confidential)fepercus-sions in NHfi .   &apos;0,   It would be necessary to assure the Professions SupplementaryoMedicine that they would benefit in the normal way from theutcome of the enquiry for nurses.    No immediate   -repercussion isxpected on ancillary staff and ambulancemen,  and this would ,ave to be resisted if it did arise.1,   There are several small groups of low paid technical classesho would press for special treatment, notably the medical physicsechnicians who are currently taking industrial action over ourefusal of their request for negotiation on the implementation,fter the ending of statutory controls, of^,.their 1972 arbitration,nthe light of the developments regarding nurses, officials are &quot;econsidering whether there is a case for a consent for this group..EACHERS r- : x . ) ----- .       -2.   In recent years teachers have fared at least as badly as &quot; --urses.    Like nurses,  they had pinned much faith on a relativitieseference and they have been publicly linked with nurses as specialnd similar cases by both the present and previous Administrations,f they are not. accorded similar treatment, a bitter public andarliamentary: campaign will be mounted;  industrial action isrobable and would be specially damaging in this term of examina-ions.    The aim of the teachers is to have salaries revalued toorrect the extent to which,., they have fallen behind and to reflectore fairly their contribution to society.    They would settle fqr4 ither an independent review or free negotiations.oview v Negotiations3.   The NUT and ATTI would probably prefer to negotiate freelya the Burnham Committees where they dominate the teachers&apos;  side,nt the other teacher unions might prefer an independent review. DESould much prefer a review as(a) more likely to meet the educational need for an adequatepay structure for career teachers;(b) avoiding an open decision - which a negotiated settlement would require - that the Secretary of State for Education&apos;\ and Science would not use the veto.    An independent      --review now would ease the continuation of the Secretaryof State&apos;s role in Burnham in future negotiations.: .

Reviewlk.    If there were a review,  it would be essential to be ableto tell the teachers and their local authority employersthat no predetermined limit would be placed on the cost ofthe recommendations.    The date of implementation to be offered initially would tee as for the nurses.15.    There is&apos; no existing body to undertake the review andthe composition of a review body to cover England, Wales and      jScotland would require careful consideration.    It might  be necessary to have two panels, one for England and Wales,   ... .Jand one for Scotland, because of the different educationalsystems and pay structures.    This might involve a chairman and,  say,  eight members, who together would need to haveexperience of education,  local government and trade unions.The&apos; terms of reference might be general eg &quot;to examinethe pay structure and the levels of remuneration of teachers&quot;;160    University teachers, who have alrr&amp;dy1 ^reached a Stage ,3settlement from October 197^,  should be excluded from the review,  though pressure for maintenance of differentials i must be expected. I17.. Public expenditure consequences. To bring teachers&apos;pay in line with the average increase in salaries for alllion-manual employees since would involve additional expenditure of the order of  250 million or 17% of the combined pay bill for English, Welsh and Scottish teachers.POST OFFICE WORKERS18.    The Post Office has offered to the unions negotiatxohsto start in June, with a probable settlement in July, on the   ;. Icondition that,  there being no current prospect of.implementing,!any such changes,  there would be no breach of faith if the Post iOffice was unable to carry them into effect,,  and that thecurrent industrial action by-the CPSA and SCS must cease before!negotiations started.    This is against Government advice,  but    i&apos;iif nurses or teachers are given authority to undertake     special reviews with implied consent to the findings&apos; and without!1?predetermined limitations,  the Post Office (and its unions)        jcan be expected to press at once for similar undertakings in,respect of its own pay neogiations.    In these circumstances,, it pwould resent strongly any restriction on the correction of itsanomalous situation by &quot;ability to pay&quot; or a limitation on .tariff increases;19.    The Post Office is being pressed by its unions to &apos;backdate a settlement to lest November (the time of the Civil.Service anomaly award).    The Post Office would hope to beallowed to backdate to 1 January 197^ for the non-engineeringgrades, and to 1 July 1974 for the engineering grades,  ie tothe start of the Stage 3 settlements.    In view of the recent  .announcement, however,  that a consent under Stage 3 could not be[justified,  we would recommend that increases should not be implemented before the end of statutory controls.
(confidential)I0     Public expenditure.    The Post Office hopes to settle at aboutillO million a year.    This would be additional to the estxmatedlost Office deficit in 197V75 or would require an 8% increase(n tariffs.HE DEVELOPMENT OF PAY POLICY -w\.   The handling of these problems must be viewed in the contextfbf the Government&apos;s announced aim of securing a smooth transition(to voluntary pay arrangements by getting -- those who have already made Stage 3 pay settlements tostick to them- those who have yet to settle in this pay round to do so atmuch the same level as those before them- people not to creaife commitments for the future by negotia-ting now for implementation when the statutory controlsend.The Government have so far    generally held this position.    Therehave been very few consents, none of them for a general reviewof pay;  and the discouragement of commitments forrthe future has just been affirmed in the case of the Post Office.22.   We are proceeding now on the assumption that the statutoryControls will be abolished around mid-July.    Subsequent voluntary arrangements have yet to be formally worked out, but it looks as though the TUC will expect the new arrangements to operate fromthe date,, of abolition without any transitional period and that hey do not envisage any arrangements for examination of &quot;special&quot;cases.    They are more likely to see collective bargaining, re-inforced by the independent conciliation and arbitration service,as affording the solution.    If&apos;,  therefore,  the Government wishto provide for nurses,  teachers and/or postal workers to have a$lecial catching up settlement,  there is much to be said forarranging this so that it appears as a positive action to clear the ground before the new arrangements begin - rather than try to persuade the TUC to find a place for these &quot;special cases&quot;in the new policy,23.   At the same time the repercussions of such action on other groups of workers in the period leading Up to the ending of the pay controls, has to be considered.    In that period(a) The Government will very likely have to issue consentsto implement the outcome of the railways arbitrations andfor London Transport.    These would not be re-opening Stage 3settlements, but such consents are likely to make the postmenI feel more aggrieved,  especially if London busmen are covered.(confidential)
(b) The Pay Doard&apos;s London Weighting report will be receivjat the end of June and there is a commitment to allow \negotiations to proceed thereafter. Although we do not knoj.what the Board Will recommend, it may well fall short of th^large increase that many expect, and this would greatlyupset London teachers.                                                                       I(c) The major negotiations being pursued over thet-next 2 hmonths - seamen,&apos;local authority non-maftuals , the industrial civil seryice and gas staffs - will of course be affected bgrelaxation for other, large groups.    The seamen have already!^tv? rejected-a 15% Stage 3 settlement and the local authority Irioh-manuals claim, like postal workers, that they have fall&apos;:behind the civil service. ,   f24. Any substantial re-opening of a Stage 3 settlement will -maifit more difficult for other union leaders to refrain from presslnfor similar treatment. The biggest countervailing factor against&apos;.re-opening Stage 3 settlements will be threshold payments, whichfjwill be triggered by the April RPI figure which is to be announc^on Friday 2k May. Dut the announcement of substantial revalua-ations, or the prospect of it, for several large groups would runga very grave risk of enhancing the pressures against the presentscontrols (particularly from other &quot;relativity&quot; cases such as theijpower engineers), and/or producing, when they.end, the sudden 1upsurge in pay settlements that the Government have been seekingcto avoid. .    - . t-.&apos;&apos;.-&apos; &apos; .....    &apos;. $THE OPTIONS25. If Ministersathink that the nurses&apos; threatened industrial action can be resisted, it would be best to hold the present lim&apos;of resisting any additions to Stage 3 settlements already made other than the limited improvements offered by Consents; and to prequire all three groups to await their next annual settlements,ftwhich would have to be negotiated under the voluntary arrangement. (26.    If Ministers do not regard this as practicable,  there are three other possibilities:     .A.    Allow a review for nurses only.        .D.    Allow a review for nurses and agree to teacherseither having a review or negotiating a settlement.C.    As  (D),    plus an undertaking to Post Office workersthat the settlement they negotiate in June will be implemented after the end of statutory controls.A.    Nurses only27.    This would limit the repercussions.    The only other grouplikely to react is the teachers, but it is uncertain how far theflwould be prepared to go in taking industrial action.    Nevertheleiteachers would be greatly incensed and it would mean that theGovernment would be forcing them to go until April 1975*  the daK
(confidential)f0f their next review, without any special consideration of theirfjpay.    This is likely to prove very difficult,  especially if the^London Weighting report disappoints them,,J28.   The Government &quot;have strongly opposed interim payments,  inIparticular in the case of London Weighting,  and an interimSpayraent to the nurses would be very damaging to the Government1 sIcurrent aims&apos; on pay policy.    The threshold arrangements will inIf act provide substantial increases while the review proceedsland their flat rate character will ensure that the lower paidRiurses more than keep pace with the cost of living.129.    The cost for 197V75 might be about  100m (all public^expenditure) or 20% of the.nurses pay bill.fa.   Nurses and Teachers ((I3O.    This would get out of the way the two cases which are mostjclosely related and neither settlement would be implemented until after the statutory controls had been removed.    However,  itfcould be difficult to justify leaving out Post Office workers,jmanyof whom are lower paid than teachers and have fallen behindjust as badly.    Post Office; clerical and executive grades arealready taking industrial action;  and if they were joined notonly by the Postmen but also by the engineers,  the effects wouldbe more serious than the last postal strike.    Furthermore,  itwould5 still leave the problem of how to handle the Post Officesettlement in July,  implementation of which within the voluntarymethods might have to be postjjosed to January 1975..&apos;31..  If teachers as well as nurses were given an interim review  ;on what would be an essentially ad hoc basis,  it would expose the Government to the criticism that it was reverting tooutworn methods rather than providing for a consistentexamination of such problems by a Relativities Board.    It could also stimulate the Post Office workers and many other &quot;relativity&quot;cases to ask for a review.    Such requests might be difficult to resist&quot; and the Government would then be led back to the approach of a&apos;&quot; special examination of &quot;relativity&quot; cases.32.    The cost might be about  350m including  250m for teachers(17% of the pay bill). , ,.C.   Concessions to all three33.    This would deal with these three major cases of discrimin-ation in the public sector as a preliminary, to starting the new policy.    However,   there would be many others who would; be encouraged to press for a review or renegotiation and it&quot;could be extremely difficult for the Government and the TUCto hold&apos; the line that those who have reached Stage 3 settle-ments should stick to them,  that employers should not enterinto &quot;forward commitments and that settlements during the restof the pay round should be in line with the Pay Code.    A7(confidential)
concession to all three groups therefore could have very extensiverepercussions and risk breakdown of the governments  attempt tomove smoothly from statutory controls to voluntary methods.3^c.  If concessions were to be made to ail three,  the question would arise whether a way of containing the repercussions, might    ibe for the proposed Royal Commission on Incomes Distribution       ,\to conduct, a review of all three cases as a &quot;mopping-up&quot; operation,This would help to answer the criticism which could be levelledat ad hoc reviews, but it would run athwart the present conceptthat the Royal Commission should not deal with specific pay cases,Moreover,  it would be difficult thereafter to.refuse access tothe Royal Commission to other &quot;relativity&quot;cases,  with the resultof establishing the Commission as a Relativities Board to dealwith cases that the TUC would maintain should be settled throughcollective bargaining.35.    The cost of allowing a review or negotiation for all three groups would be  460m,  including  110 million,.,for the PostOffice.RECOMMENDATION36.If Ministers do not regard it as possible to resist the nursespressure,   we   think that the teachers and Post Office workerswill have.to be treated similarly despite the wider risks;  andthat it will be better to deal with them all at once ratherthan accede separately to the pressures of the teachers and post Office workers as these are renewed.    This would require that(a) an independent review would be instituted immediately  ,into nurses1  pay,  preferably by the DDRD,  with implementation!after the statutory controls have been abolished.    TheGovernment should seek to negotiate in the first place thatthe implementation date would be the end of the reviewof&apos; 1;November 197^, whichever is earlier.(b) the settlement arising from,the negotiations already agreed to by the Post Office will be capable of implement- &apos; \-tation after the end of statutory &quot;controls but not backdatedbefore then;  and &apos;&quot; ;(c) teachers will be allowed either to have an independentreview or to reopen negotiations.     In the former case asimilar line to that suggested in (a),above would be taken&quot;     on implementation;  or,  if negotiation were decided the   ,aim would be to secure the latest possible implementationdate,after the ending of the statutory consents.37.- A draft is attached of a possible,- announcement placingsuch action in-the context of the transition to voluntary ..arrangements with the aim of trying to limit, the repercussions.
(confidential)38.    If Ministers accept this conclusion,  it would seem appro-  &apos;.    . ;priate for the Secretary of State for Social Services to see the nurses&apos;  representatives before anyamiounceaent is made in order toascertain privately that the proposition is viable.    Subject tothat it would only be necessary to let the teachers and Post Officeemployers and unions know shortly before the announcement.    If,however,  the nurses were to reject the proposition ,  it wouldbe necessary to reconsider teachers and Post Office workers.rI(confidential)
(confidential)ANNEXPOSSIDLE STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE ;FOR EMPLOYMENTABOUT THE PAY OF NURSES., : TEACHERS AND POSTAL WORKERSI explained to the House on 6 May that whilst the statutory-controls remain,  I could see no.basis for applying my limited powers of consent to the implementation of general increases in pay for these groups,  although I was prepared to apply those powers to certain special problems in each case where therewere exceptional circumstances.    That position still stands.But there is no doubt that these three groups have sufferedparticularly badly under the policies pursued over the last threeyears.    Those concerned have shown restraint and a sense ofresponsibility for av considerable time and tie depth of theirresentment is to be seen in the unprecedented action to whichthe nurses now feel driven.Subject to the passage of legislation and the approval ofthe House,  the Government aim to abolish by the Recess thestatutory pay controls which have contributed to the presentsituation.    We believe that,  in the interests of a smoothtransition to sensible voluntary collective bargaining,  these three cases must be afforded a remedy - though under the currentlegislation this cannot take the form of a consent.In the case of the nurses the Government accept that thereshould be an urgentindependent review of pay and associatedconditions,  the outcome of which will be implemented after thestatutory controls have been removed.    My rt hon Friend theSecretary of State for Social Services will be discussing the detailed arrangements with the nurses1  representatives.An agreement has already been reached between the PostOffice and the unions concerned to open negotiations in June.The Government are prepared to undertake that the outcome ofthose negotiations will be capable of implementation afterthe statutory controls have been lifted.In the case of the teachers the Government intend to set up anindependent inquiry to  examine the pay structure and levels of remuneration of non-university teachers in England and Wales andin Scotland.    The recommendations of the inquiry will then be amatter for discussion between the teachers and their employerswithin their normal negotiating machinery with a view toimplementation later this year after the removal of statutorycontrols.    My rt hon Friends the Secretary of State for Eductionand Science and the Secretary of State for Scotland will be making a further announcement in due course./OR    In the case of the teachers the Government similarly believet/hat it would be appropriate for negotiations to start up in the burnham and Pelham machinery for England and Wales and .in theScottish Teachers Salaries Committee, with a view to implementationat some date to be decided by the negotiators after the ending of the statutory controls.. _/10(confidential)
In all these cases the purpose will be to allow the parties concerned to determine the improvements required in pay andconditions to deal with their justified grievances.    I regard thisrelease of the parties to remedy their position in this way as anessential step,  going beyond the very limited.means at my disposalwhilst the statutory controls last,  to try to set right thesemajor distortions arising from the previous Governments policies.I musti  however,   emphasise that the Government regard these as special cases.    1 do not say that there are not others who havegrievances;  of course there are,  and that is why we must ridourselves of the controls which produce or aggravate them.    But ifwe are not ,to jeopardise our chances of fulfilling all the other aims of our understanding with the TUC,  we must ask that these three cases be recognised and accepted as priority cases,  that other groups should hold to agreements already reached or,  if they have still to negotiatetheir annual settlement,  should do so at levels similar to those other groups who have not been singled out as priority cases.    these groups;of&apos;highly responsible people can achieve redress only if therest of us now fully accept the justice of their case for prioritytreatment.111CONFIDENTIAL
