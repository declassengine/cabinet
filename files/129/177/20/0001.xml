DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 70 COPY NO      7 o12 July 1974CABINETSEX DISCRIMINATION bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentINTRODUCTION1. The Government undertook in The Queen&apos;s Speech to make proposalsfor securing equal status for women.   I propose to make a statementoutlining my proposals for a Sex Discrimination Bill before the House rises(copy attached) and to publish a White Paper in late August or earlySeptember.    I hope to introduce the Bill before Christmas so that it canbecome law well before the Equal Pay Act enters into force(29 December 1975).SCOPE OF THE bill.        The Bill will supplement the Equal Pay Act by making discriminationgenerally unlawful in employment, training and related matters.    Theexisting protective legislation, contained mainly in the Factories Act 1961,will be retained for the time being.    In education, the Bill will lay a duty(subject to a saving for the maintenance and provision of single sexinstitutions) on all educational authorities to provide facilities for education to either sex of the like quality, in the like manner and on the like terms in and on which they are provided for members of the other sex.3,        There are problems, however, about how far the Bill should go beyond this.    Although employment and education constitute the mainareas of complaint, serious complaints have also been made aboutdiscrimination in the provision/of financial facilities such as credit andmortgages, housing accommodation and access to licensed premises,restaurants and hotels: these may be symptomatic of a wider problem.4.        One way of dealing with this would be for the Bill, from the beginning to make it unlawful to discriminate in the provision to the public of thosefacilities and services which have been the subject of complaint: takingpower to add by Affirmative Resolution any other of the activities andpublic places subject to the Race Relations Act, if and when abuses come1
to attention.   Alternatively, the Bill could in principle and from thebeginning make it unlawful to discriminate in the provision to the publicof the generality of goods, services and facilities (including access to ailplaces of public resort) covered in that Act.    The second approach would ensure that nothing important is omitted but could, inadvertently, bring ina number of areas where discrimination by sex is unexceptionable orunavoidable and thus expose us to a certain amount of ridicule.5. The wide approach will have much more impact and I commend itto my colleagues.    I shall, however, need urgent help from mycolleagues in identifying and framing the possibly complex exceptionsnecessary to ensure that this approach will stand up to examination in committee and to the subsequent test of experience&apos;;  and that the timetableof the Bill will not be put at risk.6. The Bill will not deal with discrimination in the social security ortax systems, in pensions or in nationality and related matters: these aregoverned by separate legislation,,ENFORCEMENT AND THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION7. The Bill will provide individual civil remedies for the victims ofunlawful discrimination (compensation, an order determining the rights ofthe parties, or a recommendation as to a course of action) and will make provision for dealing with general practices of discrimination.   \\Employment complaints, which will be closely linked with those under theEqual Pay Act, will be considered by industrial tribunals; other complaintswill go to the courts except that those concerning the maintained sector ofeducation will be dealt with in the first instance by the education Ministers.8,        I propose to set up a strong Equal Opportunities Commission.    Thiswill help to carry forward proceedings in suitable and significant cases but its main role will be to identify and deal with discriminatory practices byindustries, firms or institutions: it will be able to issue non-discriminationnotices, to follow up court and tribunal decisions, and will also undertakemore general advisory, investigatory and promotional functions.    TheCommission will have certain powers to compel the production of relevant information.9.        The main point at issue on enforcement is whether (particularly ifthe wider approach is adopted on scope) the courts should be protectedfrom frivolous or perverse complaints by providing that cases should not go to them unless first referred to the Commission.   I doubt, however,whether such a compulsory sieve would be welcome to the women1 organisations; it could not, because of the great bulk of likely complaints,operate in employment cases, which will go to tribunals, yet it would bedifficult in principle to distinguish these cases from the others;  and it would run contrary to the conception that the Commission should concentratemainly on the broad strategy and not get bogged down with individual casework.2
INCITEMENT TO DISCRIMINATE10.       The Trades Union Congress are being consulted about thedifficulties which an incitement provision might create as regards unions and individual groups of workers.    Subject to advice in the light of these consultations, I propose that the Bill should treat any person aiding andabetting an unlawful discriminatory act as doing that act.    There shouldbe no question of any criminal sanction.CONSULTATIONS11.        Some further consultations with interested bodies will be necessary before the proposals can be finalised, particularly if the wider rangingscope is approved.   As time is short, however, I seek general approval for the proposals outlined as the basis for our further work.CONCLUSION12.       I invite my colleagues to approve the general approach described in this paper with a view to the publication of a White Paper in the Recesspreceded by a statement before the Recess, consultations with interested parties to proceed meanwhile; and in particular:1. to indicate which of the alternatives outlined in paragraph above should be adopted; j,2.        to agree that it is not practicable to use the commission as a sieve for dealing with non-employment cases;3.        to approve, subject to advice from the Secretary of Statefor Employment, a provision making aiding and abettingdiscrimination unlawful.R j home Office/     11 July 1974//7/.3
DRAFT STATEMENT1.     The Government undertook in The Queen9s Speech to make proposals for securing equal status for women.     With yourpermission, Mr. Speaker, I will give a brief outline of my proposals for a Sex Discrimination Bill.     They will be set out at greater length in the White Paper which I intend to publish in afew weeks&apos; time.,2o     Employment and education constitute the mean areas of complaint.     As to the first, the Bill will supplement the equal pay Act by making sex discrimination unlawful in employment,training and related areas.     There will be   specific exceptionsfor employment in private households, for the clergy and the armed forces and, initially, for small firms:    as well as for a fewcarefully defined instances where sex is a genuine occupationalqualification for a particular job,     The Bill will apply to employment agencies and training organisations;   in the granting of licences connected with employment;    and to the membership of,and facilities offered by, employers1 organisations, trade unions and professional bodies.-3.     Education requires a somewhat different approach.     Subjectto a saving for the maintenance and provision of single sexinstitutions, the Bill will lay a duty on educational authoritiesin both the public and private sectors to provide facilities for/education to either sex of the like quality, in the like manner and on the like terms in and on which they are provided for members of the other sex.-1-
4.     The House will he aware that serious complaints are made aboutsex discrimination in a number of other fields of activity, notably the provision of financial facilities, such as credit and mortgages,housing accommodation, and of access to licensed premises,restaurants and hotels.     There is no reason to assume that the complaints we have received are definitive;   they could be symptomatof abuses extending \ln to a much wider field than this.     The bill will therefore deal with the same range of matters as the race relations Act, making it unlawful in principle to uiscriminate onthe grounds of sex in the provision to the public of the generality of goods, services and facilities covered in. that Act.     TheGovernment recognise, however, that certain differences in thenature and incidence of sex and racial discrimination will make itnecessary to include in the Bill a limited number of exceptions andsavings additional to those contained in the Race Relations Act,5*     The Bill will not deal with discrimination in matters governed by separate legislation, of which social security and taxation arethe most&quot;important.&apos;6.     As to enforcement, the Bill will provide individual civil        lremedies for the victim of unlawful discrimination and will make provision for dealing with general practices of discrimination.Employment complaints, which will be closely linked with those underthe Equal Pay Act, will be considered by industrial tribunals;other complaints will go to the specially designated comity courts in England (sheriffs&apos; courts in Scotland), except that thoseconcerning the maintained sector of education will be dealt with in&apos;the first instance by the education Ministers.,     The Government istalcing action to increase the number of women appointed to industrial tribunals.
7.     I propose to set up a powerful Equal Opportunities Commissionto act as the pivot of the whole system.     This will help to carryforward proceedings in suitable and significant cases but its mainrole will be strategic;    to identify and deal with discriminatorypractices by industries, firms or institutions.     It will be able toissue non-discrimination notices, enforceable by the courts, and tofollow up court and tribunal proceedings.     It will also undertakemore general advisory, investigatory and promotional functions.The Commission will have adequate powers to require the production of relevant information,8.     Departments will conduct urgent consultations with interestedorganisations;   the aim must be to introduce the Bill before the endof the year.9.     In sum, these proposals, which are founded on the principlesoutlined in the Green Paper published while the Government were in opposition, go well beyond those previously put.forwarded both in scope and in the powers given to the new enforcement agencies.I believe this will be an effective approach, learning from the race Relations Acts, and avoiding a number of the weaknesses that have been revealed in them.     My aim is to harmonise the arrangementsfor dealing with sex and race discrimination to the greatest extent possible and 1 see this Bill as being a model for later improvements in the race relations machinery. -
