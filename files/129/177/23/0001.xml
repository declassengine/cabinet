DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government(74) 73 . COPY NO   yg12 July 1974CABINETMA PLIN AIRPORT PROJECTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for&quot; trade. The review of the Maplin Airport project which I announced on21 March has now been completed.    A report by officials will be published as a Departmental paper within a few days.2.        The air traffic forecasts, made after the fuel crisis, are lower thanthose of the Roskill Commission made in 1970 or of the Civil aviation authority made last year.    Taking account of the growth of wider-bodiedaircraft and an anticipated continued move towards a higher proportion of passengers per aircraft, no need is seen for further runway capacity at heathrow, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted before 1990.    The case for Maplin,therefore, rests on the need for further terminal capacity, and involvesconsiderations of cost, noise, and other environmental factors.3.        A new airport at Maplin would ensure an adequate margin ofterminal capacity even if the traffic turned out higher than the forecasts,and, from the date it became operational, it would allow a ceiling to beplaced on further expansion at Heathrow and Gatwick and the closure ofLuton and Stansted to passenger transport movements at least,    Maplincould be further expanded to provide a solution to the growth of traffic asfar ahead as can be foreseen.    On the other hand, the maximum terminalcapacity of the existing London area airports would set a limit onexpansion at some point.4.        The expansion of Heathrow and Gatwick under existingplans, with some support from Luton and Stansted, would, however, be ableto handle the forecast demand up to the mid-1980s.  Beyond that there areanumber of alternative options to Maplin, but they lie within the broad limits of expanding Heathrow and Gatwick beyond their existing plans, or asubstantial expansion at Luton and Stansted.    In either case the possibilityof the use of regional airports needs to be further considered, although realrelief in this way appears to be limited.5.        A Maplin Airport built to accommodate 28 million passengers in 1990is estimated, with all its consequentials, to cost about  650 million (at 1973prices).    This would be some  300 million more than expanding Heathrowand Gatwick beyond their existing plans, which is, itself, the most expensiveof the alternatives.1
6.        Aircraft noise will remain a very sensitive issue although, by 1990,it should be considerably less of a problem than at present and less thanthat foreseen by the Roskill Commission.    I shall be giving particular attention to the encouragement of quieter aircraft and to measures to relievenoise nuisance at airports.    In any case since Maplin could not becomeoperational before 1985, expansion at Heathrow and Gatwick, at least,would still be needed within their existing plans.RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE ACTION7.        From the point of view of noise and safety a decision to abandonMaplin will be bitterly opposed by those who live around the existing fourLondon area airports, and around those regional airports which might taketraffic diverted from the South East.    To abandon Maplin now entails risksabout future airport capacity, but, on cost, the scales are heavily weightedagainst it and Maplin could turn out to be a most unprofitable investment.8.        I have discussed these issues with my colleagues on the ministerial committee on Economic Policy who have agreed to recommend that weshould now abandon the Maplin Airport project.    I propose to make anannouncement in the House of Commons on the lines of the attached draftoil Thursday 18 July.9. Once this statement has been made, attention will need to be turnedspeedily to the alternatives.    I recommend that the Government should allow time for a debate when the House has had time to digest the review and the content of my statement.    This could clearly not be before the recess.P department of Trade12 July 1974
DRAFTCONFIDENTIALMAPLIN STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OE STATE EOR trade      With permission, I will make a statement about the reviewof the Maplin Third London Airport project.2      The reappraisal which I announced on 21 March has now beencompleted and the results will be published this afternoon.This is a factual assessment by officials with the help of theCivil Aviation Authority, the British Airports Authority and the airlines.   It deals essentially with the growth of air traffic in the London area up to 1990 and the way in which this might be handled.3      The conclusions of the review of the need for a third london airport are significantly different from those of the RoskillCommission.   Firstly, the review has produced forecasts of passengers and air traffic, taking account of the oil situationand a range of other factors affecting passenger growth.   demand in 1990 is forecast in the range of 72 to 106 million passengers,allowing for a Channel Tunnel.   Without a Tunnel, the range goesup to 114 million.   These are lower than past forecasts, but Iwould emphasise that accurate forecasting is difficult at thisstage as we still have to see the continuing effect of higherfuel prices, and how those prices might move over the next 16 years4      The passenger forecasts have been converted into air trafficmovements, taking into account the development of wider bodiedaircraft, higher passenger load factors, and the estimatedcomposition of airline fleets in 1990.5      The review has also re-assessed the runway and terminalcapacity of the existing airports in the London area.   The mainconclusion, even on the highest forecast, is that,looking aheadto 1990jthere is no need for additional runway capacity in theLondon area.   This means that the case for and against MaplinAirport rests on the need for passenger handling capacity, noiseand other environmental matters, and costs.
CONFIDE6     The review shows that there are various ways in which passenger traffic could be handled if Maplin is not built.   I particularly asked for consideration to be given to the possibility of divert-in g part of the South East traffic to regional airports both to relieve the pressure and to help in the development of other regions.    Although it appears unlikely that passengers withorigins or destinations in the South East will readily accepthaving to travel to airports very far to the north and west, Ihave asked my officials to consider these regional possibilities in greater depth and to report to me further.    This will give timefpr fuller consultation with the authorities concerned and foraccount to be taken of the series of studies by the CivilAviation Authority into regional airports. ,7     I fully sympathise with, and understand, the anguishsuffered by those whose lives are disturbed by aircraft noise-They do not want any airports near their homes.   Therefore, quiteindependently of this review, the Government is urgently considerinwhat can be done to reduce the noise nuisance by, for example,night Jet curfews, the use of revised, operational techniques, an-&quot;:improved facilities for noise insulation.   My Department will consult with airport consultative committees and others similarlyconcerned with airport operation on this matter.8     The review has paid particular attention to the anticipatednoise levels in considering the various options.   There have beenimportant advances from the Eoskill Commission.   Quieter, new types of aircraft are appearing in our skies in growing numbdrsand I have recently required new production of existing typesto conform to stricter noise standards.    I am urgentlyexamining with our operators and manufacturers how we canquieten those older aircraft now flying and achieve a progressive improvement in noise standards.   Eor the future,even quieter engines are being developed and as older aircraft/are
are replaced by newer, larger types, more passengers can be moved without increasing the number of nights.9 The review shows that, in the years to come,substantial numbers of people now suffering from seriousnoise at airports will be relieved and that, even with morepassengers, the total noise nuisance will be less thanforeseen by Roskill.     Since an airport at Maplin could not,in any case, become operational until the mid 1980s,some development of existing airports is inevitable to handleincreased traffic over the next 10 years.10 The review has also produced comparisons of the costof building Maplin and of developing alternatives.   Because itwould involve the reclamation of land, the removal of theMinistry of Defence establishments at Shoeburyness, and extensive new road and rail access, its total cost!i is&apos;not likely to be less than about  650 million.     The review showsthat there are other much less expensive ways of handling the traffic of the London area.11 The Government has, therefore, decided to abandon the.Maplin airport project.12 The alternative options for 1990 will need carefulconsideration and more detailed consultation with local interests than it has been possible to undertake in thecourse of the current review.     The review shows that, becauseof the slower growth of traffic, we now have more time toillook at the alternatives.     Because these do not involve asingle massive investment like Maplin but a series of smallerplanning decisions, their timing   can..be adjusted accordingto the need-13 Consultations with local authorities and other bodies concerned will, need to be held to enable their views to be fully taken into account in producing proposals for handling
the extra traffic which can no longer look to Maplin.Consultation will also take into account tho possibilityof diverting traffic to airports outside tho South East./T am considering with my right Hon Friend the Secretaryof State for the Environment the arrangements that shouldbe made.7w14 rfy right Hon Friend the Secretary of State forthe Environment will be making a statement shortly aboutthe Maplin Development Authority.     He is still consideringproposals from the Port of London Authority for a seaport./15 I am sure that the House will wish to debate thematter of London air passenger traffic as soon as it hashad a reasonable time to digest the review.I!i
