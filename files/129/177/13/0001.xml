3DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 63 COPY NO27 June 1974CABINET81CHILE: RESCHEDULING OF EXTERNAL DEBTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I was invited (CC(74) 19th Conclusions, Minute 2) to circulate a paper about Chilean debt.2. Chile defaulted on her external debt obligations in November 1971.In April 1972 debts falling due up to the end of 1972 were rescheduled inagreement with Chile&apos;s Western creditors, including the United Kingdom.Inconclusive discussions about the treatment of debt falling due in 1973ended with the fall of the Allende Government.    No payment has been madeon outstanding debts falling due from 1973 onwards.    The present chilean government announced last year its wish to arrange with its creditors forthe repayment of Chile&apos;s outstanding debt, and negotiations took placeaccordingly.    Thus, discussions about debt rescheduling have been conducted both before and after the change of regime.y&apos;V&apos;y .\y&apos;v-!.&apos;&quot; vuv-:^ fc^OvY.&apos;- vf^^-ii^&apos;-&apos;^:&apos;:^^&apos;^^ ;:Yyyyy&apos; y-,Vy&quot;y&apos;&quot;- &apos;,&apos;v&apos;.&apos;y&apos;,,\-3, The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee agreed in Marchthat we should support the draft Agreement drawn up by the Paris Clubon the renegotiation of Chile&apos;s 1973 and 1974 debt repayments.    We have proceeded accordingly: the multilateral agreement now needs to be implemented through bilateral agreements between Chile and individualcreditor countries.4,        Agreement in principle has been reached in the bilateral negotiations between Chile and the United Kingdom.    The total sum due is some 25 million, of which payment for warships (contracted in 1969) accounts for some  7 million - well under one-third of the total.    Chile has agreedto pay an interest rate of l\ per cent.    Formal agreements are now beingdrafted, and unless any unexpected problems arise, signature should bepossible within the next few weeks.    Repayment of the debts owing to theUnited Kingdom can then begin,5,        I do not think it is right to describe debt rescheduling as the equivalent of a new loan to Chile,    The argument depends on theassumption that if there had been no debt settlement, the debts wouldhave been paid on time, and in full.    It is virtually certain, however,that without a debt settlement most, if not all, of the debts would not bepaid.    The debt settlement is therefore very much in the creditors&apos;interest.confidential
6.        The agreement eventually reached was the best that the creditorscould hope to get, and it is very much in the United Kingdom&apos;s interest that the bilateral agreement should be concluded so that we may obtainpayment from Chile of the debts, and the interest on debts, which sheowes us.7.        United Kingdom policy on the four warships being built for Chilewas agreed at CC(74) 9th Meeting,   At that, meeting it was stated that thewarship contracts were guaranteed with the Export Credits guarantee department.    It was decided then that we should go ahead withconstruction on th*3 grounds that not to do so would almost certainly lead to retaliation and would have serious consequences, both financially,and for employment in the shipbuilding industry.    These arguments remainvalid, and are unaffected by the position on the debt rescheduling,8,        The Chileans have already made substantial cash payments inrespect of the four warships and, in conformity with conventional practice in the shipbuilding industry, they are now the legal owners of the vessels.Indeed, they could remove the ships, either now, or when they are ready for handover, provided only that they kept up to date with their progresspayments,9.        Whether or not we proceed with the bilateral debt reschedulingagreement, the Chileans can be expected to go on making the cash progresspayments and thus put themselves into a position to take delivery of theships within the terms of the contracts, payments under which continue until 1980, that is a number of years after the contractual date for delivery of the ships,D treasury Chambers26 June 19742
