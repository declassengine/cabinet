DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENTQ iC(74) 62 COPY NO   0 126 June 1974CABINETTEACHERS&apos; pensions memorandum by the Lord President of the council, On 28 November last, the then Secretary of State for Education and science accepted in principle a Motion put down by the Labour Party, then in Opposition, calling for a. a reduction in the teachers&apos; pensioncontribution from 6f per cent to the 6 per cent which had applied until1 April 1972; and b, the reckoning as to half for pension of the war serviceof post-war entrants to teaching &quot;as is the practice in the Civil Service&quot;.2.        Since then the Social Services Committee (SS) has been considering a number of detailed points - the definition of the categories of teacherswho should benefit, the operative date of the concession and whether the contributory principle should be applied.    These matters have now been satisfactorily settled.   A major matter for discussion has, however, beenthe repercussions which a concession to teachers would have elsewhere inthe public service, particularly in relation to the police, the fire serviceand the health professions.    On logical grounds it is difficult to deny toother professions what is being offered to teachers, since if it is right inprinciple to adjust teachers&apos; pensions so as to reflect interruptions in normal career progression due to war service it must be right to do thesame for other people in a like position.    The problem thus lies not ir thepoint of principle but in the practical consequences which would flow from giving effect to it across the board.    The difficulties are particularly acutein relation to manpower (there might be some earlier retirements, whichwould be serious for the police in some areas) and public expenditure (thetotal additional cost, which would be spread over a very considerable period, would be about  80 million- 100 million if the concession appliedalso to those who have already retired - though rather more than half of itwould fall within the next five years).3.        The conclusion reached by the majority of SS Committee was thatin principle the mie of resources to improve pension arrangements, whether for teachers or other groups, did not merit the highest priority, but that a firm commitment had been given in respect of teachers which we have nochoice but to honour.    SS also considered that the concession should benefit.  1
those who had already retired as well as those who are still serving.    Thegeneral view was that on public expenditure grounds we should do our best to limit the concession to teachers for the time being; but it was recognisedthat in due course extensions would almost certainly have to be accepted,and were probably right in principle, though it was hoped that they mightbe deferred at any rate until the public expenditure position was morefavourable.    The Secretary of State for Social Services and the Ministerof State, Home Office, on behalf of the Home Secretary, argued, however,that if the proposed concession were given to teachers it was essential thata parallel concession should be given simultaneously at afty rate to doctors and to the police, \\ Such a concession would be costly, would have to befound from within the Public Expenditure Survey Committee allocations ofthe Departments concerned and would, it was argued, be an irrational and unacceptable use of financial resources which were already inadequate.The Ministers argued that these undesirable consequences could be avoidedonly by giving no concession to any groups at all;  and, while recognising the difficulties presented by the terms of the resolution adopted by theHouse of Commons last November and by the subsequent discussions whichhaT* taken place with the teachers, they proposed that no concession on pensions should in fact now be offered to the teachers,4,        In view of the importance of these objections to the conclusion reached by the majority of SS Committee, I must ask my Cabinet colleagues to consider the matter and to decide whether they are prepared to endorse the majority view reached by the Committee,E privy Council Office26 June 1974/2
