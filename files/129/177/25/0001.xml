THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 75 COPY NO     ijj g17 July 1974 //CABINET )i\\ j- ,    &quot;       &quot;PEERS ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. In an agreed Statement to the House on 21 May I undertook that therate of the peers daily expenses allowance should be considered in thelight of any recommendations made by the Boyle Committee on Members&apos;allowance,2.        I therefore seek the agreement of colleagues to my proceeding asfollows:-3,        First, that I should announce before the Recess that the presentdaily allowance be raised from a maximum which may be claimed of  8.50 to  11. 50 as from 1 August.    Second, that I also announce that thewhole basis of the allowance is to be considered by an independent enquiry,by say the Boyle Committee, with a view particularly to deciding whether a differential allowance favouring provincial Peers would be the best way of proceeding in the future.4, It is accepted that Members1 allowances should be increased. Ipropose the increase in the peers allowance on the following grounds:-1, The basis for the Peers&apos; allowance has always been alinkage with the night subsistence allowance for senior civilservants; the civil servants tax free night allowances have nowbeen raised three times since January 1972 with no accompanyingincrease for Peers. , By applying the same rules as in the past thisshould now give the Peers a daily expenses allowance of  11. 50.The Lord President of the Council says at paragraph 5 of his memorandum (C(74) 71) with regard to the secretarial allowancethat &quot;the allowance is on a reimbursement basis and the increase will not therefore go into the Member&apos;s own pocket&quot;.    this argument applies exactly to the Peers&apos; allowance and it must beaccepted that the reason why the increase is substantial is becauseof inflation. r V1
2. The average of the increases recommended for Membersby Boyle (apart from the car allowance which will automaticallyapply to Peers also), is 48 per cent compared with a proposed33 per cent increase for Peers.   I would also remind colleagues that Peers do not enjoy free postage, unlike Members, and themost recent increase here is of the order of 25 per cent.5.        I believe an enquiry to be essential because the time is coming whenthe whole basis of the present allowance may no longer be appropriate forthe House of Lords.   I recommend that ihe enquiry should particularlyconsider the question of a differential allowance for provincial Peers whoseexpenses are different from those of London-based Peers.    There are considerable difficulties in such a scheme, particularly in relation to taxcon side r ation s.6.        I recommend therefore that I should announce, at the same time as the Lord President of the Council announces the increases for Members,that as from 1 August the daily expenses allowance for Peers will beraised to  11. 50 and also that the Boyle Committee have been asked toconsider the present basis of the allowance with a view to making recommendations for the future, particularly on the question of a differential allowance.house of Lords17 July 19742
