THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 52 COPY NO    u d22 May 1974CABINETSTAGE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE TOP salaries review BODYMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. At Cabinet on 16 May (CC(74) 16th Conclusions, Minute 6) I was invited to consider the threshold arrangements and timing problems ofthe Stage Three recommendations of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB).2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that thresholdarrangements might be allowed for all those with salaries of up to  10, 000but not for those above this level.    This suggestion was designed to avoid further aggravation of the already acute salary compression problem asbetween Assistant Secretaries and Under Secretaries in the Civil Service.Under Secretaries&apos; current pay is  8, 500, a differential of  500 over the top point on the Assistant Secretaries&apos; scale.    The latter includes half oftheir anomalies settlement, for which Under Secretaries did not qualify,Payment of the second half of the Assistant Secretaries&apos; anomaliessettlement plus their Stage 3 increase will take their top rate to  8, 850.The Boyle award to Under Secretaries of  350 (Stage 3) plus  150(flexibility margin) will raise their pay to  9, 000, a differential of only 150 over Assistant Secretaries.    If the Assistant Secretaries receive7 threshold payments, the differential will be virtually reduced to zero.3. The TSRB however covers not only Civil Service grades but alsosenior ranks in the Armed Forces, members of nationalised industryboards and the higher judiciary.    In the Armed Forces the effect of applying a  10, 000 cut-off weuld simply be to include Major Generals inthe threshold arrangements and to exclude the ranks above this level.    Inthe judiciary the position is more complicated.    Most of the senior judicialappointments are well above the  10, 000 level and many of the more juniorappointments are well below it; but between these there are a fair numberof appointments closely clustered around the  10, 000 point - thisparticularly applies to some of the appointments in Scotland, where thescale for the various grades of Sheriffs ( 7, 307 to  10, 850) straddles thispoint.    There are also difficulties with regard to board members&apos; salaries in the nationalised industries, which are divided into three basic ranges.
The middle range (covering such boards as the National freight corporation, National Bus Company etc) at present runs from  9, 750to  13, 7508    Similarly, a  10, 000 line would cut across the salary rangefor deputy chairmen of the lowest paid group (area electricity boards etc).If however the  10, 000 cut-off were applied on the basis of post-Stage 3figures, it is true that nearly all the full-time nationalised board salarieswould fall above this level, but a small number (eg in Cable 8t wireless and in the Civil Aviation Authority) would remain below.    Moreover, thereare a great number of public boards not directly covered by the TSRB butwhose salaries are determined as consequential of the TSRBrecommendations.    The salaries here are widely scattered and in quite a number of cases fall closely on either side of  10, 000.    If thresholdpayments were cut off at this point, it would at least be necessary toapply some discretion to give partial payments in order to avoid anomalies;but even so there would be likely to be some confusion and resentment.4.        If the cut-off is applied to the TSRB groups it would also benecessary to apply it to the doctors and dentists (the report of the doctors and Dentists Review Body has now been submitted to the Prime Minister).There are many senior hospital doctors receiving more than  10, 000 ayear, but no information is available about private earnings.    Manypart-time consultants receive less than  10, 000 from the National health service but obtain considerable earnings from their private practicestaking them well over this level.    A cut-off at  10, 000 or thereaboutswould therefore discriminate against the full-time consultants in favourof part-timers with large private practices.    A  10, 000 line would alsocut across the middle of the scale for Regional Medical Officers ( 9, 645to  10,248).    With regard to general practitioners, there are severalhundreds with net earnings over  10, 000, but no information is available on individual earnings; in their case therefore it would be quite impracticable to apply the cut-off,5.        I still feel that the arguments that lower-paid workers will resentthis type of agreement being granted to the highly-paid, and that this willmake our task of setting up a voluntary incomes policy that much moredifficult, are strong ones.    Nevertheless my colleagues will wish toconsider the arguments rehearsed above in reaching a decision.6, With regard to timing, it was suggested that there would be advantage in holding up an announcement on the TSRB increases until July,so that they emerged after the statutory pay controls had been dismantled.I can see the point of this argument; but I think that the situation could bemisrepresented by critics, who could say that the first fruits of our new approach were increases for highly paid people.    It seems to me therefore to be better to make the announcement now, and to defend the increases onthe basis that they are not only the recommendations of an independent2
body, but also wholly within the present restrictive legislation.    I alsofeel that further deferment of publication of the Report, which carriesthe date of 28 February 1974, would invite criticism and cause unnecessarydisquiet among those affected.    I therefore recommend that we should publish the Report and announce our decision immediately.E privy Council Office22 May 1974G3
