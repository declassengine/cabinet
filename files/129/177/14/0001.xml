Part 1THE PROBLEM1. About one-and-a-half million people live in Northern Ireland. Historyproduced, a divided community and has led it to have divided views about itsform of government. The whole community has not yet found a way of living and working together. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom and parliament has the ultimate responsibility for its future. By the efforts of thepeople themselves, and with the help and encouragement of the nation as awhole, Northern Ireland has made in recent years significant economic advances.But the bright prospects this created for future economic progress have beenclouded by political instability and violence. In the past five years over 1,000people men, women and children; soldiers, policemen and civilians havedied by violent means. There has been great, continuous and &quot;widespreadsuffering and destruction.2. In that same period, Northern Ireland has experienced four differentpatterns of government:- .(a) devolution of powers to the Parliament and Government of NorthernIreland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, up to March 1972;(&amp;) &quot;direct rule&quot; under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act1972, with the Government of Northern Ireland suspended and itsParliament prorogued, executive powers exercised by a Secretary of Stateand laws made by Order-in-Council, from March 1972 to January 1 1974;(c) a new system of devolution of powers to an Assembly and Executive underthe Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, from January to May 1974;and, since then(d) discharge of functions of that Executive under the Constitution Act byNorthern Ireland Office Ministers, with the Assembly prorogued.3. The main impact of this violence and political instability has been uponthe people of Northern Ireland themselves, but the United Kingdom as a whole has also had burdens to bear. Recognising the &quot;ultimate responsibility for theprotection of those who live in Northern Ireland&quot; to which the Downing StreetDeclaration of August 1969 referred, successive Governments have committedlarge numbers of troops to keep the peace, involving them in a policing as wellas a strictly military role. In August 1969 there were only 2,500 stationed inNorthern Ireland. This figure rose to 22,500 by the end of July 1972 and has never been fewer than 14,500 since that time. From August 1969 to end ofJune 1974, 000 soldiers of the Regular Army and 00 of the locally-recruitedUlster Defence Regiment have been killed on duty, as well as 00 members ofthe Royal Ulster Constabulary and 0 of the RUC Reserve.
4. Expenditure in Northern Ireland has increased significantly in recent yearsand has required an increased subvention from the Westminster Exchequer overand above Northern Ireland&apos;s share of taxation. In 1969-70 this subvention(excluding loans) amounted to about 16 per cent of Northern Ireland&apos;s public expenditure and in 1973-74 tq about 36 per cent.5. The achievement of peace and political stability in Northern Irelandrequires a major contribution by the people of Northern Ireland themselves.When the fear and instability of these wasted years is ended the Army will be relieved of its present role.
Part 2THE CONSTITUTION OF 19736. In March 1972 a period of &quot;direct rule&quot; was instituted, with the supportof the three major parties in the Westminster Parliament. It was made clearthat the new system of government was intended to be transitional. The aimwas to allow all concerned to discuss how to bring into being a more permanentsystem,&apos; commanding the broadest possible support.7. The consultative document &quot;The Future of Northern Ireland: A paper for Discussion&quot; (October 1972) and the White Paper &quot;Northern IrelandConstitutional Proposals&quot; (Cmnd 5259, March 1973) record the various dis-cussions which took place. In summary the consultative process involved thefollowing stages:(a) Intensive discussions between the then Secretary of State for NorthernIreland and a wide range of interests in Northern Ireland political parties,community groups, representatives of social, economic and other interests.(b) An invitation to individual citizens in Northern Ireland to submit pro-posals and suggestions.(c) An invitation to each of the seven political parties which had representation in the prorogued Northern Ireland Parliament to take part in a conference to discuss suggestions for the future. Three parties attended this con-ference, held at Darlington in September 1972, and put forward proposalsfor discussion. Other parties and groups also published suggestions forthe future.(d) A comprehensive consultative document &quot;The Future of NorthernIreland: A Paper for Discussion&quot; was published in October 1972, and formed the basis for further discussions with representatives of a wide range of interests.&apos;   &apos; &apos; &apos;  :      ;X&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos; :&apos;(e) The people of Northern Ireland were given an opportunity, in the BorderPoll of March 1973, to indicate by their votes whether they wantedNorthern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom or to be joinedwith the Republic of Ireland, outside the United Kingdom. An over-whelming majority of those who voted and a clear majority of the electorate as a whole, voted to remain within the United Kingdom.(f) In the White Paper of March 1973, the then Government set out fully its proposals for the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. The NorthernIreland Assembly Act 1973 and the Northern Ireland Constitution Act1973 were published and then passed into law in Westminster.
8. Throughout this process great efforts were made to find common groundbetween the Northern Ireland parties. This was made more difficult by thedecisions taken by various interests at various times not to participate in discussions.9. After the Assembly elections held at the end of June 1973, a further stage of consultation got under way. All the parties represented in the Assemblywere asked to take part in discussions as to how a broadly-based Executive,,likely to be widely accepted throughout the community, might be formed.Under section 2 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the ability tobring such an Executive into being was a prerequisite of devolution of legislative and executive powers to the new Northern Ireland institutions.10. Paragraph 72 of the White Paper (Cmnd 5259) referring to the formalappointment of political Heads of Departments in Northern Ireland made itclear that:&quot;when an agreed understanding on the formation of an Executive is reached in discussion with elected representatives, it would be the intention tomake appointments in accordance with that understanding&quot;.Certain of the parties and members returned to the new Northern ireland assembly stated that they were opposed in principle to the formation of an executive on the basis laid down in the Constitution Act. They therefore refusedto take part in any discussions, either with the then Secretary of State or withother Northern Ireland parties, to seek the agreed understanding on the forma-tion of an Executive. The Alliance Party, the Social Democratic and LabourParty and the then Official Unionist members, representing between them almosttwo-thirds of the total membership of the Assembly, eventually agreed toconsider together whether such an understanding could be reached. discussions were initiated upon the basis that all concerned fully accepted the NorthernIreland Constitution Act 1973, and continued for a period of seven weeks.11. Finally, on November 22 1973 the then Secretary of State for NorthernIreland was able to report to the House of Commons that substantial progress had been made. The three Northern Ireland parties had reached agreement ona statement of aims and policies in the social and economic sphere and on thes shape and balance of an Executive and Administration in which they would beprepared to serve together. This required a small amendment to Section 8(3)of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. This progress had made possiblethe nomination of an Executive-designate. It had, however, always been under-stood among the parties engaged in these discussions that it would be un-desirable actually to form an Executive unless and until there was agreement on all the major issues under discussion.12. One of these matters was the possible formation of a Council of Ireland,which required discussions with the Government of the Republic of Ireland.The Secretary of State therefore informed the House of Commons (official report, November 22 1973, Col 1576):4
&quot;If we are to make the advances on a Council of Ireland to which I have referred, it is essential that there should now be urgent discussions between representatives of the Government of Ireland and those persons who willbe members of the Northern Ireland Executive. This conference will beheld as soon as possible and will, I hope, reach a clear understanding.I also intend to invite the leaders of those parties in the Northern ireland assembly who have indicated that they arc not prepared to participate inan Executive to discuss with me their views on a Council of Ireland, sothat these will be known at the time of the conference. It will be necessary,therefore, to hold a formal conference between Her Majesty&apos;s Government,the Government of the Republic and the Northern. Ireland Executive,which will have been appointed by then.&quot;13. The leaders of those parties who had indicated they were not prepared totake part in an Executive, the Democratic Unionist/Party and the VanguardUnionist Party, protested that their parties should be invited to participate inthe conference on the same basis as the other Assembly parties. They argued,as did the then leader of unofficial Unionists opposed to official Unionistpolicies, that the terms of paragraph 112 of the White Paper (Cmnd 5259) werenot being fulfilled. This had stated that:&quot;following elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Governmentwill invite the Government of the Republic of Ireland and the leaders ofthe elected representatives of Northern Ireland opinion to participatewith them in a conference. ...&quot;Those leaders did not accept the proposal that they should discuss theirviews on a Council of Ireland with the Secretary of State. On December 5 1973the leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party were invited to attend the first session of the conference and to address it. This too was unacceptable to them.14. The Sunningdale Conference took place, from December 6 to 9 1973,between representatives of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, of the Government ofthe Republic of Ireland and of the three parties involved in the NorthernIreland Executive-designate. The principal features of an Agreed communique issued on December 9 were:(a) Declarations by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and by the Government ofthe Republic of Ireland on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.These were to be incorporated in a formal agreement to be signed at the formal stage of the Conference and registered at the United Nations.(b) Outline agreement on the basis for setting up a Council of Ireland, tobe implemented after further detailed study of functions and finance.(c) Agreement to establish a joint British-Irish Commission to recommend,as a matter of extreme urgency, the most effective means of dealing withthose who commit crimes of violence, however motivated, in any part ofIreland.5
id) Agreement to give a Council of Ireland a recommendatory role in relationto human rights in Ireland, and a consultative role in relation to appoint-ments to Police Authorities, North and South.(e) A re-affirmation by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of their firm commitment to bring detention to an end in Northern Ireland for all sections of thecommunity as soon as the security situation permits.(/) Parliament would be asked to devolve full powers to the Northern ireland assembly and Executive as soon as possible. The formal appointment ofthe Executive would then be made.ig) Early in the New Year the British and Irish Governments and the NorthernIreland Executive would hold a formal conference &quot;to consider reports on the studies which have been commissioned and to sign the agreement reached.&quot;      \\ /(..6
Part 3THE NORTHERN IRELAND EXECUTIVE,JANUARY-MAY 197415. By a Devolution Order January 1 1974 was appointed as the day for the devolution to the Northern Ireland Assembly of legislative powers over a very wide range of matters, and to the Northern Ireland Executive and Administra-tion of executive powers relating to these matters. At a ceremony on December31 1973 the eleven members of the Executive and the four additional membersof the Administration took the Oath or made the Affirmation required by law to&quot;uphold the laws of Northern Ireland and conscientiously fulfil my duties under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 in the interests ofNorthern Ireland and its people&quot;.The following day, for the first time in the history of Northern Ireland,elected representatives of the majority and minority communities took upoffice as a government. While all those participating retained their long-termaspirations, they all accepted the principle embodied in section 1 of theConstitution Act, that Northern Ireland will not cease to be a part of theUnited Kingdom without the consent of a majority of its people.16. The newly-appointed Executive at once took two important decisions which were communicated to the Assembly by the Chief Executive on January 241974. The first was that, although the Constitution Act did not so provide interms, the Executive would hold itself responsible to the Assembly, and would therefore at once seek a Vote of Confidence there. The second was that theExecutive would be bound by the principle of collective responsibility.17. On January 24 1974 the statement of social and economic aims agreedduring the inter-party talks was published. As soon as it took up office thenew Executive set about the task of converting these broad policy objectivesinto comprehensive proposals for the future development of Northern Ireland.The new Heads of Departments assumed control of the various services forwhich they were responsible, and from the earliest days the new system showeditself capable of coping with difficult, controversial and potentially divisivematters.18. The Assembly members of the &quot;loyalist coalition&quot; refused to play anypart in much of the business of the Assembly and did not take up their roleas the Opposition in the lawfully constituted Assembly.19. The agreement reached at the Sunningdale Conference became thecentre of deepening political controversy. Conscious that legal proceedings inthe Republic of Ireland which had not been concluded until February 22 1974,had given rise to ambiguities about that part of the Agreed Communique which7
included the declarations on the Constitutional status of Northern Ireland,the Taoiseach made a statement in Dail Eireann on March 13 1974, which included these words:&quot;The factual position of Northern Ireland is that it is within the UnitedKingdom and my Government accept this as a fact. I now thereforesolemnly re-affirm that the factual position of Northern Ireland withinthe United Kingdom cannot be changed except by a decision of themajority of the people of Northern Ireland&quot;.20. The Law Enforcement Commission (see paragraph 14c above) wasappointed on December 21 1973. It reported on April 25 1974 (Cmnd 5627).Its members were not able to agree unanimously as to the best method ofdealing with the problem. Those members drawn from Great Britain andNorthern Ireland recommended an amendment of the extradition laws but those drawn from the Republic of Ireland did not; they recommended a schemeof extra-territorial jurisdiction. The British and Northern Irish members agreedthat if extradition was not available they would recommend extra-territorialjurisdiction.21. On February 1 1974 a meeting took place in Northern Ireland atHillsborough Castle between members of the Northern Ireland Executive andof the Government of the Irish Republic, and decided how further studies of possible functions for a Council of Ireland should be conducted.22. The comparatively slow progress in these respects meant that, when theUnited Kingdom General Election took place on February 28 1974, a numberof important aspects of &quot;Sunningdale&quot; remained unresolved, and the formalConference, which had been envisaged as taking place &quot;early in the New Year&quot;had not been held. Candidates in Northern Ireland opposed to the SunningdaleAgreement and particularly the Council of Ireland received over 50 % of the vote and won 11 out of the 12 seats.23. The Executive discussions on how to make progress in implementing theSunningdale agreement were still in progress when, on May 16, a vote in theAssembly to reject a &quot;loyalist coalition&quot; Motion calling for re-negotiation ofthe constitutional arrangements was made the occasion for a general stoppage of work by the non-elected Ulster Workers&apos;Council. This started in the electricity industry and spread into other essential services. The Executive brought to a successful conclusion its discussions on implementing the Sunningdale agreement on May 22, when the Chief Executive announced in the Assembly that theExecutive now proposed that the agreement should be implemented in twophases. In the first, immediate phase, a Council of Ministers would be established as a forum for consultation, co-operation and co-ordination of action betweenthe Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of the Republic of ireland in relation to various social and economic matters. The other aspects of theCouncil of Ireland scheme-a &quot;second tier&quot; Consultative Assembly; transfers of functions to the Council; appointment of a Secretary General, etc. wouldbe part of a second phase, to be introduced only after the opinion of the peopleof Northern Ireland had been tested at a further general election to theAssembly. Ii8
24. Her Majesty&apos;s Government had been faced in the weeks before thestrike by a renewed bombing campaign by the IRA. It made it clear that their  would not be allowed to bomb its way to the conference table. Similarly,throughout the stoppage, it held firmly to the principle that there could be nonegotiation on constitutional issues with those who had not been elected aspart of the normal democratic processes. The stoppage of work continued withthe Ulster Workers&apos; Council,&quot;the various para-military associations, and the&quot;Loyalist Coalition&quot; politicians associated with them demanding early Assemblyelections as a basis for re-negotiating the constitutional arrangements. Theeffects of the stoppage were severe. A large part of the labour force, particularlyin urban areas, stopped work and many business and commercial undertakingsco-operated with those who had brought about the stoppage. The organisersprogressively reduced the electrical power output; secured a virtual strangleholdupon the distribution^^petrol and oil; and gained virtual control of other vitalservices and supplies. Many main and minor roads were blocked. The Armyre-opened the main traffic routes and, on Monday May 21, successfully took over control of the main petrol and oil depots together with the.means of distribution. The Army then began to distribute petrol and oil, with greatcompetence, to essential users.25. In response to this action taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, followingrequests received from the Executive, the organisers of the stoppage started toshut down completely the electricity system and withdraw labour from other essential services. On Tuesday May 28 the Chief Executive informed theSecretary of State that he, and his Unionist colleagues on the Executive, had come to the conclusion that some form of negotiation or mediation must beconsidered, and that if this could not be agreed, they should resign. The AllianceParty also favoured mediation, but not resignation. The SDLP membersremained opposed to negotiation or mediation. The Secretary of State told mr.. Faulker that the principle which had animated the Governmenfs conductmust be maintained and Mr. Faulkner then offered his own resignation and thatof his Unionist colleagues. The necessary broad basis for maintenance of theExecutive accordingly ceased .to exist, and on May 29 the Warrants of theremaining members of the Executive and Administration were revoked.26. In plain terms the Ulster Workers&apos; Council in association with the para-military organisations brought down the Executive, which, in a spirit ofpartnership, had undertaken the tasks of government in Northern Irelandsince January 1. In the political history of these islands, few men had everundertaken a more arduous yet honourable task, with a full awareness of thepolitical and even personal dangers to which they were exposing themselves.What they attempted to do was undoubtedly distorted and misrepresented andthey found it difficult to establish themselves and their policies against a back-ground of continuing violence. The unremitting campaign of the ProvisionalIRA, and the violent actions of other extremist organisations including thesectarian murders of Roman Catholics created an atmosphere of growingpolarisation and distrust, unreceptive to the politics of conciliation and com-promise. Yet, if the Executive failed, the men who served in it did not fail.They disproved for ever the idea that it is not possible for Protestant andRoman Catholic to work together for the; good of Northern Ireland and its people. -(/secret
SECRETPart 4THE PRESENT POSITION27. When the Executive came to an end, other provision had to be madeurgently for the government of Northern Ireland. Under the Northern IrelandConstitution Act 1973 the powers devolved, since January 1 1974, to theAssembly and Executive did not automatically revert to Parliament and toHer Majesty&apos;s Government. Section 27 of the Act, however, enables theAssembly to be prorogued by Order in Council if it appears impossible at thattime to appoint a new Executive on the statutory power-sharing basis; andsuch an Order can be made for a period of four months or less withoutparliamentary approval. Her Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfied that thecircumstances for such a prorogation existed. Accordingly on May 29 her majesty by Order in^ Council directed that the Northern Ireland assembly should stand prorogued for four months.28. Section 8(6) of the Constitution Act provides a means for dealing withdevolved executive powers under these circumstances by enabling the Secretaryof State to appoint, for periods of up to six months, persons who do not complywith the normal statutory requirements namely that there should be a broadly-based Executive, drawn largely from the Assembly. Using these powers, theSecretary of State has appointed the two Ministers of State and two Parlia-mentary Under Secretaries of State at the Northern Ireland Office to be politicalHeads of the various Government Departments and Offices in Northern Irelandformerly headed by members of the Northern Ireland Executive and administration.29. These very temporary arrangements, necessary though they were to preserve a framework of orderly government in Northern Ireland and adequatein the short term, would have two serious flaws if applied for a longer period.In the first place, on devolution day, January 1 1974, the simplified legislativeprocedures, for Northern Ireland business, under the Northern Ireland(Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, lapsed. In the second place the position ofNorthern Ireland Office Ministers as Heads of Northern Ireland departments or Offices is anomalous in that under the Constitution Act they are responsiblefor these duties not to Parliament but to an Assembly which is prorogued,and of which they are not themselves members.30. There is therefore a need to make better temporary arrangements forthe orderly government of Northern Ireland.31. In the short term, the most pressing problem is that of legislation. TheNorthern Ireland Executive had prepared an extensive programme of future legislation over a wide range of the matters devolved to them. To proceed witha programme of this kind entirely by way of Bills in the United kingdom parliament is out of the question. Inevitably any less pressing legislative proposals for Northern Ireland, however desirable in themselves, will now have10
bLMJC Ito be deferred, to the disadvantage of various groups in the Northern Irelandcommunity. There are, however, measures which cannot be put off. if orderlygovernment is to be carried on, for example to appropriate money for thepublic services. The Government will therefore be bringing forward legislation which would re-introduce temporarily procedures for making laws for NorthernIreland by Order in Council on matters within the legislative competence ofthe Assembly.32. The temporary legislation will also make the Secretary of State respon-sible to Parliament for the devolved services.33. These temporary arrangements will supersede, for the time being,various provisions of the Constitution Act concerned with the legislativefunctions of the Assembly and the executive functions of Heads of departments and others. All othervprovisions of the Constitution ^ct, such as those dealingwith the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, with financial arrangements,with the prevention of discrimination, and with appointments to variousoffices, will remain in full force and effect.. The temporary arrangements will come into operation on the passing into law of the legislation providing forthem, and will operate for a period of one year (which may be reduced, or extended for a further period of not more than one year, by order of theSecretary of State, and subject to the approval of Parliament).34. Initially the Assembly will remain prorogued but the legislation willprovide for dissolution on the date of calling a further election for the purposesdescribed in paragraphs 50 to 56 below. On that day the first Northern ireland assembly, elected in June 1973, will be dissolved, but the powers necessaryto prescribe a date for further Assembly elections, should this be considered desirable, will not be affected.1111
Part 5FINANCE35. Although Northern Ireland is physically separate from Great Britain,and has had its own political institutions for more than 50 years, its economy is an integral part of the British economy. All parts of the United kingdom share a common currency, the same external tariff structure and the sametaxation systems. Northern Ireland is no different in this respect from scotland or the North-East of England.36. But because Northern Ireland has separate political institutions and aseparate budget the support given through the public sector to the Provinceemerges clearly, as isAnot the case with other parts/ of the United Kingdom.Until recently the financial relationship was that laid down in the Governmentof Ireland Act 1920 and in a number of special agreements and arrangements.The arrangements in the Constitution Act of 1973 acknowledge the &quot;reality ofthe situation, namely that public finance in Northern Ireland is worked on an expenditure basis, that is to say that money is provided to the extent necessaryto pay for approved programmes of expenditure. Under that Act, all taxes,though not the local rates, in Northern Ireland are levied and collected by theUnited Kingdom authorities. Northern Ireland&apos;s share of tax revenue is handedover to Northern Ireland; the amount to be handed over is calculated by theTreasury under rules which take full account of the fact that tax revenueproperly attributable to Northern Ireland may not be collected there. this includes corporation tax on the profits of companies based in Great Britainwhich operate in Northern Ireland. In calculating Northern Ireland&apos;s share nodeduction is made for the cost of defence, the diplomatic service or overseas aid; nor for the cost of the Army&apos;s operations in Northern Ireland.37. The expenditure of Northern Ireland Departments, plus expenditure inNorthern Ireland by United Kingdom Departments, considerably exceedsNorthern Ireland&apos;s share of United Kingdom taxation. Expenditure by UnitedKingdom Departments takes various forms: the Northern Ireland Office meetsthe cost of the law and order services such as police, courts and prisons; money is paid into the Northern Ireland National Insurance, ,Fund; and variousagricultural and food subsidies are paid. In addition, to bridge the gap betweenreceipts and expenditure, there is a direct transfer of funds from the UnitedKingdom in the form of a grant-in-aid towards the general expenditure ofNorthern Ireland.38. The amounts required to supplement Northern Ireland&apos;s tax revenuehave, in fact, considerably increased in recent years. Excluding loans, the total for 1971-72 was  126 million, for 1972-73  181 million and for 1973-74 310 million; and for 1974-75 the estimate is  350 million. Including loans,the corresponding figures are as follows: for 1971-72  195 million, for 1972-73 283 million, for 1973-74  376 million; and for 1974-75  430 million. In bothsets of figures that for 1974-75 is subject to adjustment. A fuller explanation ofthe financial relationship and of the financial assistance will be publishedseparately at a later date.12
39. Within the constraints applicable to public expenditure in the UnitedKingdom as a whole the underlying principle determining Northern Ireland&apos;public expenditure programmes, the acceptance of which has led successiveUnited Kingdom Governments to supplement Northern Ireland&apos;s tax revenue,has been that of parity. This has meant that rates of benefit in the cash social services have been the same in Northern Ireland as in Great Britain; that northern Ireland&apos;s progress towards overall standards of services and welfareas high as those prevailing hi Great Britain has not been frustrated through lack of finance; and that Northern Ireland has had industrial incentives greaterthan those available in the assisted areas of Great Britain to compensate for itsrelative disadvantages. The principle of parity has brought great benefits to northern Ireland. While Northern Ireland has been recognised and helped bythe United Kingdom Government as a region with economic and development&apos;problems as serious as any other in the United Kingdom, it is not the case thatuniformly depressed, standards of life, service and environment are to be foundthere. For example; proportionately more houses have been built post-war inNorthern Ireland than in Great Britain; there are more doctors and hospitalbeds per inhabitant; and there is almost 10 times as good a chance of a placein a Government Training Centre as in Great Britain.40. Nevertheless there are still gaps in standards of living, employment,housing and social conditions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The present Government is concerned with the welfare of those United kingdom citizens who live in Northern Ireland. It wishes to make further progress towardsclosing these gaps, but it has to be appreciated that events in Northern Irelanditself, not least any resumption of industrial action for political ends, couldfrustrate that intention. The willingness of the Westminster Parliament respon-sible to the United Kingdom electorate as a whole to transfer additional moneyto Northern Ireland and to continue to invest resources in Northern Irelandwill inevitably be affected by the progress of events there.13
part 6LAW AND ORDER41. The Downing Street Declaration of August 1969 stated:&quot;the United Kingdom Government have ultimate responsibility for theprotection of those who live in Northern Ireland when, as in the past week,a breakdown of law and order has occurred. In this spirit, the UnitedKingdom Government responded to the request of the Northern ireland government for military assistance in Londonderry and Belfast in orderto restore law and order. They emphasise again that troops will be with-drawn when law and order has been restored.&quot;The Northern Ireland Government have been informed that troops havebeen provided on a temporary basis in accordance with the UnitedKingdom&apos;s ultimate responsibility.&quot;As long as the United Kingdom has ultimate responsibility for the govern-ment of Northern Ireland, its consequential responsibility for the protection ofthose who live there is inescapable.42. The &quot;temporary basis&quot; has continued for almost five years. The burdenupon the Army is heavy. It has responded magnificently. The nature of thepresent conflict is, however, very different from 1969. The problem now is essentially that of dealing with relatively small numbers of ruthless and viciouskillers and bombers who care nothing for human life or human rights. TheArmy has in consequence had to respond and to change its tactics to deal withthis threat. The Army cannot, however, replace the Police, nor should it beasked to be a substitute. The effectiveness of any Police Service stems from thefact that its lives within the community which it serves and draws its strengthand support from that community. The community knows it and it knows thecommunity. The people of Northern Ireland can make an essential contributionto ending violence, not by seeking to take the law into their own hands, but byshowing their determination to create a just and stable society and by acceptingand supporting the Police Service. Nothing would transform the security situation more quickly than a determination by the whole community to supportthe Police Service and co-operate with it. This is not happening. If it did takeplace it would also have a fundamental effect on the need for emergency powers in Northern Ireland, including detention, the operation of which is currently being examined by the committee sitting under the chairmanship ofLord Gardiner. It would also enable the Army to make a planned, orderly and progressive reduction in its present commitment and subsequently there wouldbe no need for the Army to become involved again in a policing role. This is the aim of the Government and must be the wish, of the overwhelming majority ofthe people in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.43. Political progress will help to produce a constitution in which the com-munity will positively support the Police Service but peace, law and order are14
not bargaining counters, nor arc they matters for indifference; they concern the very fabric of society. The Government welcomes the holding of discussionswithin various groups in the community which have extended towards establish-ing peace and withdrawal from violence. It would equally welcome such dis-cussions being extended throughout the whole community on a wider basisprovided that the aim is equal security for all.I  i15
Part 7THE NEXT STEPS44. Since the fall of the Executive the Secretary of Slate for NorthernIreland has had extensive discussions with political leaders, with leaders from many other walks of life, and with representatives from a number of groups and interests. It is clear from these discussions that many people would welcome the chance of seeing whether they could resolve the problems of NorthernIreland themselves. The people of Northern Ireland must play a crucial part in determining their own future. No political structure can endure without their support and no just and stable society can be created without their full partici-pation. Political structures should not be confused with political relationships.If the Northern Ireland community can reach a broad consensus of agreementany one of a numberof possible patterns of government might well be workable.If agreement is not reached, the troubles in Northern Ireland will not onlyremain but could intensify. No one will be able to turn this defeat into a victory.That is reality.45. It is only part of the reality which must also include recognition of anumber of facts :-(a) the people of Northern Ireland are only a small fraction of the total population of the United Kingdom. Citizenship of the United Kingdomconfers not only rights and privileges but also obligations. Any pattern of government must be acceptable to the people of the United kingdom as a whole and to Parliament at Westminster. The part is not greater thanthe whole;(b) Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, shares a commonland frontier and a unique relationship with another country, the republic of Ireland. Any political arrangements must recognise and provide forthis unique relationship. There is an Irish dimension;(c) history has caused divisions within the Northern Ireland community.Events of the past few years have amply demonstrated that no part ofthat community can, let alone should, be coerced into accepting the others&apos; view. Events have also shown that a consensus can be obtained on the basis of serving the interests of the whole community. There mustbe some form of power-sharing and partnership because no political system will survive, or be supported, unless there is widespread acceptanceof it within the community. There must be participation by the whole community.46. It would be premature at this stage to say that the approach embodied in the Constitution Act 1973 is untenable. Indeed, much of the-content of thatAct is not a matter for dispute. What is apparent is that there is little prospectof forming from the present Northern Ireland Assembly another Executivewhich meets the terms of that Act.16
47. The temporary arrangements for the government of Northern Irelandoutlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 offer no permanent solution. The government believes it would now be right, as a first stage in further consideration of NorthernIreland^ future, to provide a forum in which elected representatives of thepeople of Northern Ireland may have the widest possible discussions with the aim of determining what measureof agreement can be reached among themselves.No possible solution need be excluded from such discussions but any proposedsolution must recognise the realities outlined above. Moreover, a majoritydoes not have the right to impose its will in all circumstances; nor does a minority have any absolute right to veto. For its part the Government mustweigh respect for majorities and protection for minorities.48. The Government continues to believe that the best and most desirablebasis for political progress in Northern Ireland would be the establishment oflocal institutions enjpying broadly-based support throughout the community.It has always been recognised that there is no means to impose such a systemupon Northern Ireland if substantial sections of its population are determined to oppose it. Indeed, the final paragraph of the White Paper of March 1973(Cmnd 5259) included these words:&quot;These, then, are the Government^ proposals to Parliament, to thecountry, and above all to the people of Northern Ireland themselves for away forward out of the present violence and instability. At every point,they require the co-operation of these people themselves if they are tohave any prospect of success.They can be frustrated if interests in NorthernIreland refuse to allow them to be tried or if any section of the community is determined to impose its will on another.&quot;49. Local institutions in Northern Ireland cannot be established on a basisunacceptable to broad sections of opinion there; equally they cannot be cstab-lished on a basis unacceptable to the United Kingdom as a whole or to Parlia-ment as representing it. Any system which results in the permanent exclusion from any real and substantial influence in public affairs of a whole section ofthe community is inherently unstable and would be unacceptable to her majesty&apos;s Government.50. Against this background the Government proposes to introduce legisla-tion for the election of a Constitutional Convention, to consider what provisions for the government of Northern Ireland would be likely to command the mostwidespread acceptance throughout the community there.51. The legislation will provide for the convention to be based upon the constituencies and the methods of election prescribed by the Northern ireland assembly Act 1973. It will accordingly consist of 78 members, elected on a multi-member basis from the 12 Parliamentary constituencies in NorthernIreland by the Single Transferable Vote system.52. The Convention will be required to make a report or reports on its conclusions which will be laid before Parliament. It will be dissolved on the date
of laying its final report, or six months from the date of its first meeting, which-ever is the earlier; but the dissolution may be postponed or further postponedby order subject to Parliamentary control for periods not exceeding threemonths at a time. Provision will also be made for re-convening the Conventionwithin six months of its dissolution, if it appears desirable that any matter should be considered or further considered.53. The Government propose that there should be an independent Chairmanof the Convention, a person of high standing and impartiality closely associatedwith Northern Ireland by birth or other connections. He will not be a memberof the Convention. The appointment will be made by Her Majesty the Queen.Provision will be made for him to have any necessary supporting staff, whowould also be available to assist any group or groups of members of the Con-vention if this was so desired. It will of course be open to any member or group in the Convention to obtain other advice from any quarter they wish.54. The intention is that the Convention will be entirely a forum for elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland. The Government will playno part in its proceedings but will, of course, be willing to make available factual information and to assist the Convention in any way which is likely to bringits deliberations to a successful conclusion.55. In the event of the Convention producing recommendations whichcommand majority and widespread support from its members the Governmentwill give the most serious consideration to them. In any event it may prove tobe desirable for the Government to test directly the opinion of the NorthernIreland electorate on their attitude to particular or to alternative proposals before any course is recommended to Parliament. The proposed legislation will therefore make provision for the Secretary of State to direct the holding of a referendum or referenda on questions arising out of the work of the Convention.56. In short, the Government proposes that the following steps should betaken in order to allow the fullest discussion of the future.(a) temporary arrangements&apos; to be made for the government of Northern(b) A consultative Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention to be elected,to consider what provisions for the Government of Northern Ireland wouldbe likely to command the most widespread acceptance throughout thecommunity there;(c) The Convention to have an independent Chairman and 78 member selected under the Single Transferable Vote procedure;(d) The Government to lay the Convention^ Report before Parliament andalso the results of any referendum.This course offers the people of Northern Ireland every opportunity to takethe lead in shaping their own future in accordance with the realities describedIrelandearlier.18
57. It has become clear during recent discussions in Northern Ireland that many people will welcome an opportunity of this kind. This belief has been strengthened by a new awareness in the Protestant and Catholic working classof their real interests and by their wish to play a real part in political activity.It is clear that adequate time for preparation is needed. Indeed, in recent months,various groups within the Northern Ireland community have shown an increaseddesire to participate in the political processes and a growing belief that they can best find for themselves political relationships which will be acceptable to them.The Government believes it essential that participation in these processes shouldtake place not only between like-minded groups, but equally between groups which hold apparently strongly opposed views. Some lime is required for political groupings to emerge and develop, to engage in discussion with other parties and interests, and to clarify but not foreclose their positions. TheGovernment considers that this process of discussion and consultation is a necessary preliminary to the holding of the election of members to the Con-stitutional Convention. It would not, therefore, propose to hold an immediateor early election and would aim to give about four weeks&apos; notice of an election.In the meantime Her Majesty&apos;s Government would hope that the process ofdiscussion and consultation leading to an election to the -Convention would develop on as wide a basis as possible.58. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that these proposals offer a newopportunity to all the people of Northern Ireland to contribute directly, and intheir own way, to the solution of their own problems. The need is for a jointand stable society. It can be achieved by the people of Northern Ireland withtheir awareness of the realities of the situation. Failure will bring defeat to all.Success will bring the only real victory.
