&apos;  PAY OF SCIENTISTS.   .    Note.by theMinister of State; Civil Service department in April this year the Pay Board&apos;-reported (Advisory&apos;Report No 3) onthe criteria and method for determining scientists&apos; pay which havebeen the sublet of a bitter dispute going back to 1971 between theOfficial Side and the Institution of Professional Civil Servants (IPCS),The two sides were committed in advance to accepting the Board&apos;srecommendations of which the most import-mt one was that in futurescientists&apos; pay should be determined by pay research rather than by.internal Civil Service relativities as favoured by the IPCS,2,     Sinoe it will not be possible to mount a pay research survey before-1 January&apos;1976, Ministers have agreed that scientists, whose pay has fallen badly behind because of the dispute, should have an immediatepay settlement outside Stage 3 by means of a consent.3m     In formulating an offer I had three main considerations in mind:-i.     it must be broadly defensible in relation to the Pay Board&apos;sReport,   We therefore updated as best we could the.last pay-research survey of 1 January. 1971?&quot; ii.   against the background of current constraints and particularly the consent procedure it must not be over-generous;iii.   on the other hand, a reasonably good offer is vitally   ..neoessary to counteract the bitterness which the dispute has      -engendered and which has already seriously undermined the morale.   .    and efficiency of Government scientists (and of those, much largerV numbers of scientists in &quot;fringe&quot; bodies whose pay is linked to civil Service rates).4.    My proposals, which were subsequently approved by Ministers, are set out at Annex A alongside :the IPCS claim together, with cost estimates(including consequential) and the percentage increases involved^1
5.    The IPCS reaction to this offer was strongly unfavourable.   On17 May they presented their case to the Prime Minister who undertookwithout commitment to consider their request to do something more for at least the HSO, SO and ASO grades.   They indicated that they would recommend acceptance of our existing offer for the PSO and SSO if we agreed to an extra.  200 at the HSO maximum and to their full claim for. the SO and ASO grades.6,     I had myself originally proposed to add an extra  150 incrementto the top of the ESO scale which Would have cost an additional  0,66m.for the Science Group ( 1.90m. with consequential) and would have raised the highest percentage increase at scale points from 12.5 percent to 17.7 per cent.   But this was opposed by the Secretary of Statefor Employment and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (though supportedby the main employing Ministers) on the ground that since, it did not result directly from updating the 1971 pay research evidence it wouldbe difficult to Justify as part of an interim settlement &quot;based on the pay Board&apos;s Report.7.     In my view this extra increment, though less than the IPOS arenow asking for, makes good management sense in itself and is essential if we really want to restore goodwill.   It would not prejjjdice thefuture application of pay research to scientists.   While I understand the objections of the Secretary of State for Employment and of theChancellor of the Exchequer, I doubt very much whether the Hdard*srecommendations are so clear that we could not defend this additionalimprovement as being broadly consistent with them if we wanted to.8.     In the light of the IPGS representations I think we should alsobe justified for the same reasons, in offering a little more to thelow paid grades of SO and -flSO (though again less than the IPCS claim).For the SO, I propose a one-ipoint scale shortening which would cost 0,08m, on the assimilation terms we would use ( 0,25m. with conse-quentials) and increase the maximum scale point rises for thisgrade from 10,9 per cent to 14.4 per cent.    For the ISO I propose an improvement in the rate of progression through the scale by
splitting it into a main scale and a Jimior scale.    This would costan additional  Ocllm. ( 0,31nio with consequential) and the maximumpercentage increase in the scale would rise from 12 per cent to14 per uent.9.    The problem of scientists1 pay is by far the most importantjustified pay grievance in the Civil Service and there are the best possible management grounds for doing all we legitimately can to solve it.     I therefore recommend strongly that, our offer should be improved as proposed in paragraphs 7 and 8 above0R civil Service Department22 Kay 19743
