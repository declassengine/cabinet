SECRETL The Prime Minister, accompanied by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Defence and the attorney general, met Mr Faulkner, Mr Fitt and Mr Napier at Chequers today.2.        There is no doubt that the Administration in Northern Ireland isnot at present in control of the situation on the ground.    The strikers areincreasingly demonstrating to the population that the essential servicesand supplies of food and fuel are in their control.3.        The best assessment that can be made is that:a. The argument is not about Sunningdale, the Council ofIreland, etc.    It i3 basically an attempt by-extremists toestablish an unacceptable form of neo-Fascist government.b. Moderate Protestant opinion is increasingly accepting the position of the extremists because it thinks they are winning.It will only swing back if evidence of firm government is shown.c. The extremists will probably seek to avoid a confrontationwith the troops, although if some essential services are restoredthere will no doubt be an attempt to disrupt others,4.        If we do nothing, the Executive will collapse over the weekend.On the other hand an attempt by the British Army in effect to run thecountry would require the commitment of unacceptable forces and wouldprobably fail.    Nor are the Northern Ireland Executive seeking such adisplay of force.5. Any course carries risks. But unless we are prepared toabdicate our responsibilities, the most promising action seems tobe:a. Full support by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for theNorthern Ireland Executive with no negotiation on constitutionalmatters outside the constitutional framework.    A copy of thePress notice released after today&apos;s discussions will be available at Cabinet.b. A major political and publicity campaign to make this clear and to bring home the meaning of thebasis on which power-sharingis established.c. Some action on the ground to show moderate opinion thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government and the Executive retain credibility,have the will to govern, and are capable of influencing events.The Executive have sought our agreement to the implementation of our contingency plans for oil distribution.    It would also be
SECRETnecessary to implement the gas contingency plans.    These couldbe introduced fairly quickly:  and do not necessarily commit us to,eg subsequent similar action with the power stations.    Thepossibility of further escalation cannot be excluded: but thesesteps seem the best hope of avoiding it.    No commitment wasgiven to the Executive this afternoon but the Prime minister unertook to discuss the matter with the Cabinet this evening.May 1974
