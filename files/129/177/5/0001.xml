DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 55 COPY NO       822 May 1974CABINETCONCORDEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The economic case against proceeding with Concorde is as strongas ever.    To complete 16 aircraft would cost at least  361 million - 245 million more than the cost of cancellation.    The balance of payments is unlikely to gain from such a programme, but would benefitsignificantly if the resources employed on Concorde were put to alternative use.2. Cancellation now would simply bring forward by two orthree years a degree of unemployment which would arise in any ;case when the 16 aircraft were completed.    The only serious problem would arise at Bristol where special arrangements, including higherredundancy payments, would mitigate the consequences.3. The Attorney General advises that unilateral cancellation bythe United Kingdom would now involve less risk of damages, and smallerdamages, than we expected when last in office.    There are good reasons why the French might not wish to take us to court.    If they did, we wouldhave a reasonable prospect of winning.    But even if we lost, the maximumdamages have been assessed at  150 million.    In any event, the total of the cancellation costs and the maximum damages are nearly  100 million lessthan the additional costs that we should incur if we built 16 aircraft.4. My colleagues are well aware that we shall be under severepressure to limit public expenditure for some years to come.    when we settle our social priorities for the next few years there will inevitably be acute competition for such resources as are available.    Any fundsdevoted to Concorde will necessarily mean that less is available for other purposes.    Moreover a commitment to the programme of 16 aircraft will invite further pressures for making a larger number to maintainemployment both here and in France and for further development to produce an aircraft which has more chance of becoming marketable.
secret,        Any proposal to nationalise the aircraft industry will be condemnedfrom the start if it is saddled with a project which we have publiclydemonstrated to be grossly uneconomic.    The principle of public ownership will be seen as an excuse for wasting public money.6.        Concorde is a very expensive prestige project.    If we donot have the courage to deal firmly with it now, the credibility ofour economic policy generally will be impaired.    Our decision wouldbe viewed overseas as a failure to face up to the realities of our present economic situation.7.        I therefore strongly urge my colleagues to accept that our aim mustbe cancellation and that this should be proposed to the French.    If theFrench do not agree, we should still be prepared to cancel unilaterally,in the knowledge that our legal position is reasonably secure,D treasury Chambers22 May 1974
