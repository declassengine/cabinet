S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 71 copy no 7 g12 July 1974CABINETALLOWANCES OF MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Top Salaries Review Body which was invited by the PrimeMinister on 31 May &quot;to review the current rates of allowances payable to members of the House of Commons, and to recommend the levels to whichthey should be increased&quot; has now submitted its report and we need toconsider whether to adopt its recommendations.2.        A copy of the report is attached.    There are four recommendations as follows:-i. Car Allowance   -   present rate i5 pence a mile- recommended rate 7. 7j ipence a mileii. Secretarialallowance -   present maximum  1, 000 pa- recommendedmaximum  1,750 pa   1iii. AdditionalCostsAllowance -   present maximum  750 pa- recommendedmaximum  1, 050 paiv. Londonsupplement        -   present rate  175 parecommended rate and    228 paa small change in therules governingentitlement3.        The recommended increases in car allowance and additional costsallowance result directly from corresponding increases in the equivalentCivil Service rates of allowance and I suggest that they be accepted.    the increases in percentage terms are large but as it is nearly 3 years since they were last reviewed they are well justified in relation to increases in costs.
SECRETARIAL ALLOWANCE4.        The increases recommended in secretarial allowance and therecommendations for London Supplement merit closer consideration.   Anincrease in secretarial allowance from  1, 000 to  1, 750 more thancompensates for increases in secretaries&apos; salaries since 1 January 1972,but the Review Body believes that Members of Parliament (MP) nowemploy more secretarial assistance and should be paid a larger allowanceon that account also.5.        I do not consider that this large increase in secretarial allowance will attract valid criticism.    The allowance is on a reimbursement basis and the increase will not therefore go in a Member&apos;s own pocket.    i therefore recommend that we accept this recommendation,LONDON SUPPLEMENT6,        The recommended increase in London Supplement from  175 to 228 corresponds with the increase awarded to civil servants serving ininner London from 7 November 1973 since the present allowance for MPswas pitched at precisely the same rate as the Civil Service inner Londonrate.    However, some Members may urge that they should be paid  400London Supplement following the recent Pay Board report which was notavailable by the time the Review Body completed its own report.    Thereare three grounds for limiting the increase to  228:-a. The Review Body has not recommended any increase in thelight of the then forthcoming Pay Board report - and wish to leaveopen the position for a complete re-examination next time.b. No Civil Service increase in London Weighting has yet been negotiated, nor have other public sector groups so far madesettlements.    It would be better if MPs were not in the lead inthis matter.c. Although the amounts of London Supplement for MPs and the inner London Weighting for civil servants were the same, the criteria for determination and conditions of entitlement weredifferent.    Furthermore since MPs are paid travelling allowance and the Pay Board figure of  400 includes an alement of  75 for the extra costs of travel to work, as well as special elements for&quot;wear and tear&apos;, the Pay Board recommendations cannot be saidto be automatically applicable to MPs.I therefore recommend that the increase to  228 in London Supplementshould be accepted.2
7.        Finally the Review Body recommends that those Members whorepresent constituencies in the Greater London area but who do not claimadditional costs allowance should have the option of being paid LondonSupplement instead.    The reason for this is that a few MPs livesufficiently near both to Westminster and their constituency to carry outall their Parliamentary duties from a single home in the London area.They incur the extra costs of living in London but are not entitled to LondonSupplement since this is payable only to those with constituencies in the inner London Education Authority (ILEA) area.    They have no need to claim additional costs allowance since they do not normally need to stayaway from bome^   Thus they receive neither allowance..   Few members are in this category but what they consider to be an unjustifiable anomalywill be rectified if we accept this recommendation.    Of course, a newboundary - the Greater London Council (GLC) area rather than the presentILEA area - will be created and some Members representingconstituencies just beyond the GLC boundaries may now feel that they tooshould be similarly treated.    But if this arises, it could be resisted onthe grounds thata. the Members concerned do not represent Londonconstituencies, and b. such Members do not necessarily incur the extra cost  .of living in the London area even though some may choose to do so.The Review Body&apos;s recommendation represents a useful concessionand I therefore recommend its adoption without further Extensionof it.10,       Subject to colleagues agreement, I propose to make an early announcement in the House and arrange for simultaneous publication of the review Body&apos;s report.   Resolutions will have to be moved subsequently,and provided that this can be done by the end of this month I propose thatthe effective date of the changes should be 1 August 1974.E privy Council Office12 July 19743

Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report, Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament (Cmnd U836 - December 1971).- 1 -&apos;   . IffREPORT ON MEMBERS&apos; OF PARLIAMENT&apos;ALLOWANCES&apos; I   &apos;    . :&apos;&apos;V   ;introduction.&quot;    Immediately after we were appointed in 1971, we were asked to review the remuneration (including allowances and expenses) and pension arrangements ofMinisters of the Crown, Members of Parliament, and other paid office-holdersin both Houses of Parliament.   Our report was accepted by the Government andwas published in December 1971&apos;&apos;&apos;.   The recommendations oh the remuneration offembersof Parliament were implemented with effect from 1 January 1972 andthose affecting Ministers of the Crown and other paid office-holders, togetherwith the new pension arrangements, were implemented from. 1 April 1972.   We havenow been invited to review the rates of allowances payable- to Members ofParliament to meet necessary expenses incurred in the course of their parliamentary duties.   We have not on this occasion been asked to look at thebasis on which they are paid, or at the level of salary.2.     In our first report, we described in some detail the system of remuneration for Members of Parliament.   Briefly, Members are paid a salary (at present 4,500 a year) and, to assist them in the performance of their parliamentary duties, they are provided with certain facilities, including free stationery,. &apos;  - &apos; II     ))postage and telephone usage in the House of Commons, and with certain allowancestowards defraying expenses.   Those expenses towards which no allowances are payable, as well as the excess expenses where allowances are payable, have tobs met out of income: tax relief is, of course, available provided that thenormal requirements under Schedule E of being &quot;wholly, exclusively andnecessarily incurred&quot; in the course of work, are met.   Members arc entitled to four allowances towards their expenses; car allowance,   (in lieu of free travelvouchers), which is of long standing; secretarial allowance, which has beenpayable since 1969; and, since 1971, subsistence allowance and London supplement.We discuss each of these in turn.Car allowance [/3.     Car allowance is payable towards the expenses for journeys by car in the performance of Members&apos; Parliamentary duties.   It is payable in respect ofjourneys between Westminster and constituency, Westminster and home, home and
5.     The object of the secretarial allowance when it was introduced was tocontribute to the cost of providing secretarial assistance.   At the outset in1969, the amount was fixed at a maximum of  500 a year.   In 1971, we found that&apos;nearly all Members either employed, or shared in the employment of, a secretary and that, while limited office accommodation and equipment was available&apos; in theHouse of Commons, Members had to provide all facilities in their constituencies.We also found that a number of Members made use, or shared in the use, of research assistant to supplement the service available from the House of Commonslibrary (which was fully extended and could not be expanded to provide additionalresearch assistance because of the accommodation limitations).   In thesecircumstances, v/e proposed that the conditions of payment of the secretarialallowance should be extended to cover both secretarial and general officeexpenses, and that part of the costs incurred in employing a research assistanton work undertaken in the proper performance of a Member*s duties should beadmissible under it .6.     The maximum rate payable currently is  1,000 a year (as we recommended in1^71); of this,  300 may be used towards the cost of employing a researchassistant.   In making our 1971 recommendations, we took account of the salarylevel payable to a personal secretary in the civil service, as well as of the* Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report, Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament (Cmnd ^836 - December 1971), paragraphs 43 to ^5*- 2 -constituency, and within constituency.   It also covers return journeys from home to rail station or airport, as well as journeys outside Westminster andconstituency to visit central and local government authorities concerned with?. Member&apos;s constituency problems.4,     The current rate is 5p per,mile.   It was fixed in November 1970.   When itwas first introduced in 196l, the car allowance was restricted to the equivalentcost of first class rail but, since 1969, it has borne a close relationship tothe &quot;standard rate&quot; of motor mileage allowance for the civil service.   Weconsider;that this remains an appropriate basis of comparison.   In November1970, the standard rate was 3*5p for cars with engine capacity below 1000 cc,4.5p for those with engine capacity between 1001 cc and Y?30 oc, and 5*0p for those with engine capacity of more than 1750 cc.   The corresponding amountspayable currently are 6.Op, 7.1p and 7*7p respectively.   We recommend that thecar allov/ance should be increased from 5p to 7*7p per mile.Secretarial allowance
expenses of providing office accommodation, stationery and equipment.   we also had regard to the fact that most Members required part-time secretarial assistance only; our inquiries at that time showed that 70 per cent of Membersemployed a secretary for less than 30 hours a week, and that the median periodof employment was 23 hours a week.   We have not carried out an inquiry intothe present amount of secretarial assistance, but we have evidence whichsuggests that it may have increased considerably since our previous review.Based on these considerations, we recommend thnt the secretarial allowancelimit should be increased from  1,000 to  1,750 a year.   We also suggest bhatup to  550 should be allowable against the cost of research assistance: our reasons for distinguishing;, between these two elements are set out in our 1971Report (paragraph kk).   In making this recommendation we are aware that a small1part of the increase must count against the Stage 3 pay limit.Additional costs (subsistence) allowance7.     We recommend the introduction of subsistence allowance to help defray theadditional cost of living away from home when engaged on Parliamentary duties.We found that this was the largest item of expense incurred by Members,particularly for those provincial Members who were not resident in London, andwe suggested a scheme that involved payment of a daily subsistence allowancebased on the &quot;regular&quot; visitor&quot; rates for senior civil servants (Class A(l))\life also recommended that provision should be made for the scale of these (payment to be adjusted in line with adjustments made from time to time in the relatedcivil service rate, and we understood that our recommendation was accepted.Under the scheme we proposed, provincial Members would be required to choose between being regarded as living and working either in London or in theirconstituency, and would receive the appropriate allowance towards the additional cost incurred in attendance at their other place of work.   While accepting our recommendation in principle, and after consultation with the House of Commonsauthorities, the Government decided against the introduction of a dailyallowance oh the grounds of its complexity and practical difficulty inoperation, and introduced instead an annual allowance (also subject to a limit).At the same time, the rate of allowance was made common for all provincialMembers regardless of where they lived, in order to meet Inland Revenueobjections to tax-free treatment of the allowance for Members whose real homeswere in London or in their constituency, but who chose for them not to be so^ Grades wit?i a minimum salary not less than that of an Assistant Secretary.- 3 -
- k -Confidentialdeemed.    Provincial Members are required to register with the authorities ofthe House their &apos;main home for the purpose of performing their parliamentary duties&apos; if they live either in London or in their constituency, and may claim the allowance towards the cost of staying away from home overnight whilecarrying out their Parliamentary duties at their other place of work; those whose home is in neither are eligible for the allowance, but must choose whether to claim it for living in London or in the constituency (but not both).   We&quot;understand that expenses in excess of the allowance for living away from thenominated home may be claimed as a deduction from income before tax, and that notwithstanding the position which we described in our 1971 Report (paragraph kO)in practice Inland Revenue may allow such claims.18.     Tho present maximum rate payable is  750 a year.   This is slightly higherthan the total of a daily subsistence allowance at the Class A(l) civil service&quot;regular visitor&quot; rate for London ( 5*25 in December 1971). for four nights aweek over &quot;$k weeks (the average period since 1964 in which the House of Commonssat in one year).   Adopting the same approach, but making use of the latest figures for the &quot;regular visitor&quot; rate for London ( 7.20) and the duration of theaverage Parliamentary session since 1971 06 weeks), we recommend that thesubsistence allowance for provincial Members should be increased from  750 to 1,050 a year.&apos;\- &apos; u.. - &apos;  -      ,London supplement9.     For London Members and for those provincial Members who elect to be treatedas resident in London, we suggested the payment of a London supplement of 175 a year, based on the amount of London weighting paid to civil servantswho work in the inner London area.   However, in making a common subsistence allowance payable to all provincial Members, the Government found it necessaryto restrict the payment of the London supplement to London Members only.   Theamount of London weighting for civil servants has been increased to  228 ayear with effect from 7 November 1973*   Accordingly, we recommend that theLondon supplement for London Members be increased now from  175 to  228 a year.10. We are aware that a limited number of Members who represent constituenciesIf &apos;within the area of the Greater London Council but outside the Inner LondonEducation Authority Area, incur the extra cost of living and working in thecapital without any recompense.   These Members carry out all their parliamentary duties.from a single home, but are unable to claim either London Supplement orsubsistence allowances.   Our 1971 recommendations for a differential structure of subsistence allowance would have permitted the payment of London supplement
in these circumstances.   We consider that there is still a case in equity foreuch payment now to these Members.   Although strictly this is outside our termsof reference, v/e see a strong case for rectifying the anomaly.   We make thisrecommendation now, but we consider that the arrangements as a whole should bere-examined on the next occasion-when remuneration is reviewed.Stage 3 Pay Code11.   V/e have taken the necessary steps to assure ourselves that our recommendations are in conformity with the Stage 3 Pay Code.Pi-, V .    ; &apos; . ,-.&apos;...-.(/. &apos;iBOYLE OF HANDSWORTHH W ATCHERLEYBEECHINGGEORGE COLDSTREAMANTHONY LLOYDSEEARMARK TURNEROFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICS27 June 197^- 5 -
