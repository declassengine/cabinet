DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 689 July 1974CABINETASSISTED AREA BOUNDARIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the -exchequer, The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy recently discussedpossible changes to assisted area boundaries, on the basis of the attached report by officials on proposals put forward to the Committee by the secretaries of State for Industry and for Wales.    Officials had recommended that no changes should be made for the present, but thatthe matter should be looked at again towards the end of the year in the lightof decisions on steel closures and of possible changes in the regional employment pattern.2.        It was generally acknowledged during the Committee^ discussion that there was a strong case for a fundamental review of assisted areapolicy at an appropriate time.    But the Committee were divided on whetheror not there should be some immediate changes in advance of such a review.Those who favoured immediate changes considered that the package should include the following 5 areas:-COPY NO      7 8Mersey sideNorth West WalesEdinburghC ardiff travel -to -workarea (excluding Newport)) From development area to) special development area) From intermediate area to) development area)Chesterfield To intermediate areaIf this package were adopted, the upgrading of Merseyside could affectShotton, but a decision on the latter&apos;s status would need to await the outcome of the review of steel closures.3. The following arguments were advanced in favour of immediatechanges:a. Each of the proposed upgradings could be justified on merits, since in each case the rate of unemployment, eithermale or total, was worse than in similarly graded areas.1
b. There would be clear political advantage to theGovernment in demonstrating its concern for these areas.c. The cost to public expenditure would be relatively low(up to  20 million a year for the changes listed in paragraph 2).4.        Against this, there were the following arguments:a. Upgradings without compensating downgradings would further dilute the effectiveness of regional policy aids, and makeit harder\to conduct a more fundamental review of regional policy.Each upgrading of one area tends to diminish the relativeattractiveness of another.b. The extra incentives that would be provided by the proposedupgradings would have little short-term impact on employment inthose areas.c. Because of the constraints on public expenditure as a whole,additional expenditure on assistance to these areas would inevitablyreduce the scope for other expenditure,5.        I invite the Cabinet to consider whether or not changes to assisted areas should be made on the lines set out in paragraph 2.D treasury Chambers9 July 1974P2
(confide ntjal)POSSIBLE CHANGES TO ASSISTED AREA BOUNDARIESREPORT BY OFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON REGIONAL POLICYINTRODUCTION--1.    At their meeting on 1 3 May the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policyinstructed the Official Committee to re-examine,on the lines indicated by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the upgradings of certain assisted areas which hadbeen proposed in memoranda by the Secretary of State for Industry and theSecretary of State for &quot;Wales, and to report to the Ministerial Committee by mid-June.    (EC(7U) second meeting item 2, EC(7U)6 and 7).   The re-examination shouldtake account of the points made at the meeting, including the possible repercussions on other areas and the progress made in the review of steel closures.background.    The powers to specify an area as a development or an intermediate area lie in Section 1(1) of the Local Employment Act 1972 (as amended) and those todesi.gjna.te a special development area in Section 1(h) of the Industry Act 1972.In exercising these powers the Secretary of State is to have regard to all thecircumstances actual and expected, including the state of employment and unemploy-ment, population changes, migration and the objectives of regional policies.   the coverage of the assisted areas is shown in the map at Annex A.3. Under the Industry Act regional development grants are payable in specialdevelopment and development areas in respect of capital expenditure on industrial buildings and plant at rates of 22$ and 20% respectively; regional developmentgrants are also payable in intermediate areas at the rate of 20% in respect ofexpenditure on buildings only (generally much the smaller part of total cost).These grants are automatic, but in addition the Secretary of State has very wideHHHHflMHMimpowers under the Act to give selective assistance to projects in all categories of assisted area which are likely to provide or maintain employment.   regional employment premium is payable in special development and development areas at therate of  1 .50 weekly for every adult male employed in manufacturing industry, withreduced rates for other categories of worker.ii.    Two points stand out.   The first is that it is the change from intermediatearea to development area status which confers the major benefits and is corres-correspondingly the most expensive to the Exchequer j   only limited assistance is givenautomatically in intermediate areas, while upgrading from development area to(confidential)1
(confidential)speoial development area merely increases the rate of regional development grant&quot;by 2$.   The seoond point is that selective assistance provides a powerful andflexible instrument which is particularly appropriate for dealing with the speci;problems of difficult areas,GENERAL CONSIHERATIOHS5*   The present classification of areas has remained unchanged since the majorreview of March 1972 and is therefore related to the economio situation as itwas then seen.   In the past two years unemployment in Great Britain has fallen by over a thirdj   all partB of the country have shared in the improvement, tlioug]in varying degrees.   The present pattern of unassisted, intermediate, development and speoial development areas is not necessarily therefore what would be reoomoie;if the system were being set up de novo at the present time.   There are obviousanomalies, with areas with relatively high unemployment and poor prospects &quot;being less favourably&quot; treated than others which are faring better.6*   Nevertheless there are substantial arguments against over-frequent changes,Incentives lose their persuasive effeot unless industrialists feel that theyoanrely on a reasonable measure of stability.   This was recognised in the previousAdministratioafs undertaking (in their March 1972 White Paper*)to maintain thesystem until 1978* and again in the reoent statement by the Minister for industry IThe main problem would be downgrading; there could be charges of breach of faithfrom industrialists who had embarked on schemes in the expectation that the later Istages would enjoy the same assistance as the earlier.   Consequently though itwould be reasonable in present circumstances to expeot that any upgradings couldbe matched by the downgrading of areas no longer in the same need of assistance,in praotioe substantial period of notice would have to be given of downgrading.This would defer any saving to the Exohequer.7*. If however, because of this difficulty changes are limited to upgradings, thiiis bound to dilute the effectiveness of the incentives offered at the same time as it increases the cost to the Exohequer. Extending the assisted areas, althoui.it may stimulate the development of local industry, will not add to the total amount of mobile industry available in the country as a whole; it will merely &amp;rits distribution. In the main one area&apos;s gain will be another&apos;s loss, and thisiis likely to be particularly marked if the extensions are large in relation to tlsize of the existing catergory; at present SDAs contain just over 9$ of the ei&quot;pl0!population but this would rise to 12-J$ if Merseyside were added.   Again Das and&apos;&quot;Industrial and Regional Development, Cmnd 4942a
(confidential)together include 21$ of the employee population, &quot;but if all the upgradings nowproposed were implemented the proportion would beoome 24$.   Upgrading of one areapressure from them for further changes, in addition to pressures from areas whichconsider their case for upgrading to be at least as strong aB those of the areasselected.   Given the variety of factors on which decisions about assisted area    &amp;status depend, it is seldom possible to prove conclusively that one area deservesselection while another does not; and it is particularly diffioult to do so whencircumstances have changed so muoh sines the system was established.   Steps taken to remedy one set of anomalies may oreate another.8*. The question whioh needs to be asked when examining the proposals for change is, therefore, not so muoh whether they are justified in themselves as whetherthe oase for them is so pressing; as to outweigh the general arguments against anychange.   The present map of the assisted areas was deliberately drawn on very broadlines, reflecting the circumstances of regions and sub-regions rather thanindividual localities; changes which produoed islands of one category in the middleof areas of a different category would be inconsistent with this policy.   On theother hand major ohanges ought to be preceded by a fundamental review.   At thepresent time pressure for ohange does not seem to us such as to make some sort ofrevision inevitable.i ITiming9.  There are three faotors whioh suggest that Ministers would be better placed to take decisions on regional strategy towards the end of the year.   The first isthat the general direotion of the economy should then be clearer; if risingunemployment were in prospect this might point to different conclusions than wouldBeem appropriate on the basis of recent trends.   Second, this would make it possibleto take the decisions when more is known about the proposals for the new industry bill and, if desired, to announce them as part of a single strategy.   Third, it ishoped that the review of the British Steel Corporations programme of closures willhave been completed by November, thus providing a further basis of fact on which totake decisionsJ it might also he possible to link the two sets of announcements.10.   The upgrading of unassisted areas to intermediate areas should not cause concern to the Commission sinoe it would not disturb their classification as central areas;and reolassifioation of Ms as SLAb seems unlikely to be controversial.   Reclassifi-demobilisation of intermediate areas as development areas would, however, need careful handling in the Community, though where this can be presented as remedying a seriousBust also be expeoted to have a shadow.effect on neighbouring areas and to generateEEC Aspects
(confidential)anomaly (as with Edinburgh) there seems no reason to suppose that either theCommission or our partners would oreate difficulties.   The Commission have indioathat they would be sympathetic to proposals to inorease assistance in the case of!areas affected by steel olosures; though there might be more resistanoe on their part to proposals to grant BA status for the whole of SE and NE Wales.  However,the uk Government have made clear that one of their important negotiating object!is to secure the adoption of rules flexible enough to allow the pursuit of the regional polioies they consider neoessary.CONSIDERATION OF PARTICULAR AREAS11. We have re-examined the case for the upgradings proposed by the secretaries of State for Industry and for Wales, taking account of the possible repercussion!on other areas and of the anomalies and pressures to whioh they might give me,In order to show up the anomalies we have made a quick survey of areas which havea male unemployment rate at least 1.5$ above or below the average for their typeof area. We have discarded those which were not regarded as serious candidates for change of status because they were too small or isolated or because a change jstatus would oreate a patohwork effect,as well as some areas where specialconsiderations obtained. The table at Annex B summarises the result. This tablegives the male unemployment rates for Maroh and May 1974* Cas weH as &apos;tne employepopulation) for each of the areas proposed for upgrading by the Secretaries ofState and for the areas identified in the course of our review, as well as notingsome special factors such as seasonal effectB. For purposes of comparison the tsalso Bhows the average male unemployment rates for each category of assisted areeIt should, however, be emphasised that unemployment is by no means the only rele\factor, though the fact that it oan be measured with some aocuraoy means that itthe one most often quoted.

The following paragraphs disouss both the areas suggested for upgrading bySecretaries of State for Industry and for Wales and certain of the others whiohseemed to us to warrant further consideration.Merseyside13* There is no doubt that the scale and severity of the Merseyside unemploymealproblem is matohed only by that of West Central Scotland- whioh is already an ^* Latest figures available are for May 1974?

CONFIDENTIAL

But it is difficult to believe that reclassification as an SDA - an extra 2% on regional development grants - would have any decisive effect in attracting new industry, given the width of the Secretary of State&apos;s powers to give selective assistance. Its value would be mainly psychological, as an earnest of government support for local authorities, trade unions and employers in their efforts to improve the unfavourable labour relations image of Merseyside which is mainly responsible for the area&apos;s failure to attract new industry. Moreover upgrading Merseyside would increase by some 37% (about 3/4 million) the employee population of the SDAs and, to the extent that it was successful in attracting more industry, it would adversely affect other SDAs, especially West Central Scotland which is less accessible than Merseyside. It could also have adverse effects and generate pressures for upgrading in the NW Wales DA and the NE Wales IA, and adjoining towns to the East.

Edinburgh

14. Edinburgh/Leith is the only part of Scotland not a DA and its position as a small IA well over 100 miles from the next IA is unique; this would limit the repercussions. Industry has been leaving the city for the surrounding DA,(mainly before it became an IA), though this seems to be in some degree typical of all large towns. Unemployment rates (total 3.4%, male 5.1%) are however below the average for development areas. Reclassification of Edinburgh would lead to pressure for similar treatment for Cardiff.

Chesterfield and Notts/Derby Coalfield

15. The Chesterfield area lies between South Yorkshire (part of the Yorkshire/Humberside IA) to the north and the Notts/Derby Coalfield IA to the south; local unemployment is only marginally below that in the latter, though considerably below that in the former. Chesterfield&apos;s position is undoubtedly anomalous and it has suffered as a result; but even so unemployment has declined locally over the past two years faster then the national average and job prospects are good. Giving IA status to Chesterfield could stimulate claims from other places in the Midlands, eg Cannock, Lincoln, Newark and Stoke.

16. Since the main argument for upgrading Chesterfield is its position between two IA&apos;s it is worth considering the alternative possibility of down-grading the IA status of the Notts/Derby coalfield. This is a small isolated IA where good progress has been made in attracting new industry in recent years and prospects for the future are good, with vacancies high in relation to the numbers unemployed. On the other hand unemployment is still above average for an IA.


(confidential)Cardiff/Newpar t17*   There are parallels between the case for up-grading Cardiff and that forEdinburgh.   But the main argument for upgrading is the employment outlook whichwill result from the closure of the East Moors Steel Works.   Closure would invollthe loss of 4600 jobs in 1976/771 virtually all at once.   Eventually the works nilhave either to be olosed or modernised, though the timescale oould be lengthened,If the works were modernised, there would still be a loss of some 2000 jobs, 0;the other hand unemployment is at present low at only 2.9$ (4.1$ male) and wellbelow the average for development areas.   Moreover the number of manufacturing vlin prospect in the Cardiff area - over 2,600 - is encouraging and shows that industrial jobs oan be attracted by the present range of incentives.   Selectiveassistance has been used generously in the area to attraot industrial projects,The SE Wales IA also includes Newport whioh is currently better placed than CardiJ(male unemployment 3.9$ and no known major factory closures in prospect) t Barry,1Cwmbran New Town and a surrounding rural area.   The application of the broadband)prinoiple would point to the uniform treatment of this whole area.   Cardiff scommunications with the Midlands and the South East make it attractive as a localfor industry, and in the longer term it stands to do well out of the Hardman extgon Government dispersal.   Up-grading Cardiff with its greater environmentalattractions could have implications for the surrounding areas, and attract projetjwhioh would otherwise have gone to the Welsh SDA and other areas less favourablyplaoed.Shotton18.   Unemployment at Shotton is ourrently low at 2.8$ (male only 3*0$) and thepresent position oould not justify upgrading.   (To consider Shotton alone would leave small areas to the west as isolated pookets and it would be appropriate to treat the whole of the HE Wales IA as one).   The present BSC proposals for the ending of steel making at Shotton would involve the net loss of some 6,000 jobsif basic oxygen steelmaking replaced the open hearth steel-making at least 2,possibly 3,000, jobs would still be lost.   There is little labour available at and industrialists are reluotant to /commit themselves to Shotton until they areoonvinced that they will be able to recruit.   Here again the result of the closijlreview should be awaited.North West Wales DAt9.   Unemployment is high at 7.1$* (9*3$ male) - above the average for SD&amp;b. Hgeographical remoteness makes it relatively unattractive to mobile industry(confidential)
(confidential)inadequate opportunities have resulted in a continuing drift of young people fromthe area.   The case for upgrading needs to he considered along with that forShotton and Merseyside since the upgrading of these two areas would reflect on therelative position of NW Wales.   But it seems unlikely that the limited advantages of SDA status would have much effect in attracting industrial projeots to a ruralarea such as this where the numbers of unemployed are relatively few and widelyecatteredf it is understood that the Anglesey Aluminium Company have had difficultyin reoruiting suitable workers.Mid and South Yorkshire\20.   Unemployment in the Yorkshire coalfield is well above the average for all IAsat 4*0 per cent total (5.1 per cent males) and vacancies are low in relation to thenumbers unemployed; further heavy job losses are in prospect.   Present plans for development of the Selby coalfield will require about 2,000 miners when build-up is completed.   The Coal Board expects most of these will transfer from other parts ofthe Yorkshire ooalfield.   In the Sheffield/Rotherham area, as in other steel areas,employment in the steel industry may deoline over the nextt10 years and the futureof the BSC Templeborough works is in question.   The number of jobs in prospect is however quite high.   All in all therefore, there would seem to be no present need to oonsider upgrading.North-East Scotland21.   Unemployment in this area - at 2.2 per oent total (2.8 per cent males) - is wellbelow the average for DAs and below the average for IAs:   it has fallen by 51$over the last 2 years oompared with a fall of 36$ in Great Britain as a whole.Downgrading to IA would save the payment of REP and of RDG on plant and machineryfor oil-related activities whioh need no Government incentives to locate in thearea (although it is estimated that under a tenth of the oil-related jobs in the region are in activities whioh qualify for these incentives). But although migrationfrom the area has been arrested, the oil boom has oreated difficulties for existing companies unconnected with oil, in the form of labour shortages and higher costswhioh threaten the longer term prospeots of the area.   The area is remote frommajor UK markets; retention of existing incentives would assist in strengthening the relative position of indigenous firms and so help to preserve a more balancedemployment struoture against the time when the peak of oil exploration has passed.The majority of the Committee consider that downgrading should only be entertainedas part of a far more fundamental review.South Wales SDA22.  tThe economic position in the South Wales valleys has improved in recent years(confidential)7
(confidential)with the introduction of new industries and the slower loss of jobs in coal-min^Average unemployment in the SDA as a whole is well below other SDAs and aboutaverage for all DAs.   The vaoanoies are low but jobs in prospeot are greater thanthe number unemployed.   The probable loss of jobs at the BSC Ebbw Vale works and the possibility of further job losses in ooal mining rules out the question odown-grading the eastern valleys.   But unemployment in the Neath, Maesteg andCymner areas is only 3.4$ and SDA status here seems hardly justified,CONCLUSIONS23* The primary choice seems to us to lie between making no changes in the nearfuture, whioh is what most of the Committee would advise, and making only limitedohanges. Major ohanges would produce in effeot a different system and should onlbe made after a fundamental review of the present one; this would in our opinionbe premature only two years after the present system oame into operation, Iflimited ohanges are in prospeot, Ministers may think that (for the reasons givenin paragraph 9) they would be better placed to take decisions towards the end ofthe year.24,   Upgrading of Merseyside, Edinburgh and Chesterfield, as originally proposedby the Seoretary of State for Industry, (cost to the Exohequer about  10 million a year), could be presented as designed in the main to remedy anomalies.  Even sothere would be reperoussions; not every one would aocept that these oases were sufficiently distinct to warrant speoial treatment and there would be claims forupgrading other areas, in particular North West Wales.   At the same time the secretary of State for Wales has suggested that the upgrading of SB Wales, NorthEast Wales and North West Wales would be a necessary corollary (at an estimatedextra cost of about  15 million a year).   The totality of these changes would substantially upset the balanoe of the present system and inorease the pressure for further ohanges.(confidential)
