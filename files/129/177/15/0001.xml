i DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTIRS -C(74) 65 COPY NO        811 July 1974CABINETNORTH SEA OIL POLICY: DRAFT STATEMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. I attach for the agreement of my colleagues the statement I proposeto make in ParHament at an early date about North Sea policy .    It hasalready been discussed in Energy Committee, and incorporates theCommittee?s comments,2.        We should consider the timing of the statement.    It is essentialto make it before the start of the Recess,    But I should advise against astatement this week unless there are overwhelming political reasons forone.    This is because:a. We want to minimise the chances of a debate before the recess,    The attitude of the other Parties is uncertain.    If we were defeated, it would make renegotiation more difficult.    Even if wewere not we should be under some pressure to define our attitude torenegotiation in more detail than would be tactically wise.   although I can see political advantages in having a debate and even beingdefeated,b. The presentation of these proposals to the companies andforeign Governments is very important.    It can make all thedifference to success or failure in the renegotiation, and we mustprepare it properly.    We should for example tell the United states administration, whose attitude will be crucial, a reasonable time before the statement is made,c. I should not be able to consult BP, as I have undertaken to do:to inform them the day before the announcement would not dischargethis obligation.3.        I should therefore prefer to postpone a statement until after this week.Its exact timing after that should depend upon Parliamentary and political considerations at the time.E G V Department of Energy1 July 1974SECRET
SECKEYDRAFT STATEMENT   BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR energy the Labour Party election manifesto expressed &quot;Labour determination to ensure not only that the North Sea and Celtic Sea oil and gasresources are in full public ownership, but that the operation of getting and distributing them is under full Government control withmajority public participation&quot;.   We also made it clear in theGracious Speech that it was our intention to ensure that as a resultof the exploitation of these resources maximum benefit is conferred onthe community, and particularly on Scotland and the regions elsewhere -such as Vales, which is well-placed to benefit from any Celtic Seadiscoveries - in need of development.   The statement I am about to makedeals with the steps we are to take to implement the first of these undertakings.   My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for scotland will shortly be announcing special measures designed to benefitScotland.Britain&apos;s oil is of course already publicly owned.   That was carriedout by the last Conservative Government but one under the continental shelf Act (1964).   It was therefore our task to work out a new structure and taxation arrangements which would combine our manifestocommitment with an assurance to the oil companies about the substantialrole that would remain to them.Accordingly, immediately on taking office the Government began a fundamental review of our Continental Shelf policy.   This review isnow largely complete and I thought it right to let the House knowstraight away of our main conclusions.   We have of course had verymuch in mind the excellent report by the Public Accounts committee under the Chairmanship of my Rt Hon Friend the Paymaster-General, andthe many representations which we have received from all interested parties since we came into office.The House will know of the new forecasts of oil production published by the Government in May.   We now expect our oil production to reach100-14Om tons in 1980 and 100-150m tons, or even more, throughout the1980s.   During the past year, the world price of oil has more thanquadrupled: the f.o.b. price of Middle Eastern oil, a year ago about32 a barrel, is now  9-10.   If prices remain high and with the highproduction now expected, profits on our offshore oil will be enormous.By 1980 we expect annual pre-tax profits, assuming the current priceof oil continues, and on a realistic estimate of output, to total over 3,000 million.   It might be substantially more.   Under present arrangements, tax and royalty would take a relatively small proportionof profits in the early years, and would never take much more than half.The result is that North Sea licensees would reap enormous anduncovenanted profits on their investment.   A half or more of the post-tax profits are likely to be remitted overseas; by 1980 the cost ofsuch remittances to our balance of payments could under present arrange-nients approach, or indeed exceed,  1,000 million annually.This shows that an intolerable situation would arise.   Prominentleaders in the oil industry themselves accept that a more equitablearrangement is essential.   It also shows how much is at stake in developing this major natural resource for the benefit of the nation.This is what the Government intend to do.   We. have two objectives:-   to secure a fairer share of profits for the nation and tomaximise the gain to the balance of payments.   This must mean
a &quot;big increase in Government revenue from our continental shelf.   On the other hand, the oil companies must have asuitable return on their capital investment;   we recognisethat the costs of exploration and development have been very heavy.-   to assert greater public control - essential if we are tosafeguard the national interest in an important resource, aresource which belongs to the nation.To achieve these objectives, the Government intend to take action under five heads.First, we shall propose legislation in an early Finance Bill to imposean additional tax on the companies&apos; profits from the Continental Shelfand to close various loopholes in the rules governing existing taxation on their profits.   My Rt Hon Friend the Paymaster-General will make astatement on the Corporation Tax aspects immediately following my statement.Secondly, we shall make it a condition of future licences that thelicensees shall, if the Government so requires, grant majority par t-ioipation to the State in all fields discovered under those licences.This will broadly follow the &quot;carried interest&quot; pattern successfullydeveloped in Norway.Thirdly, it is our belief that majority State participation in theexisting licences for commercial fields provides the best means for thenation to share fully in the benefits of North Sea oil without unfair-ness to the licensees since the State contributes its share of the costs.   Certainly this is the solution adopted with the consent of the oil companies in almost every other major oil and gas producingcountry in the world, not only those ;in the Middle East.   Indeed, asthe participation of the National Coal Board and British Gas shows,public sector participation has worked successfully in the BritishShelf, without injury to oil company interests.   I hope that thecompanies will recognise the strength of our views on this.   Ve want the oil companies to continue to invest in the North Sea on profitableterms.   We shall be very ready to listen to what they say and consider with them how our common interests can best be served.    I am sure theindustry will want to put to us their views at the earliest possible moment and to enter into talks with us on this basis and I shall beinviting them to do so shortly.Fourthly, we shall set up a British National Oil Corporation through which the Government will exercise its participation rights.   ThisCorporation will represent the Government in the present consortiaand also build up a powerful supervisory staff expertise that willenable it to play an active part in the future development, explora-tion and exploitation of the Continental Shelf.   It will also have powers extending to the refining and distribution of oil.   The mainoffice of the BNOC will be in Scotland.fifthly, we shall extend our powers to control physical production andpipelines.   Experience has shown that there are many weaknesses inour present system.   We shall, therefore, for current as well as futurelicences take power to control the level of production in the national interest.   This does not effect our determination to build up production as quickly as possible over the next few years.   The question of reducing the rate of depletion is unlikely to arise during this decadetot we believe that we should take the necessary powers now.   We shall
also take powers to receive royalty in kind, and to remit royalty incertain circumstances; to control the development of undersea pipe-lines, in the same way as we do on land; introduce tighter powers over exploration and development; and require licensees to provide more information about their activities than is now obligatory.   Allthese new proposed powers, together with existing powers, will enable us also to ensure that proper precautions are taken to protect the environment.We shall be discussing the detailed implementation of these and other changes with the companies.We intend to bring legislation on these matters, and on the establish-ment of a British National Oil Corporation, before Parliament as soonas possible.There are other matters which we are still considering, for examplehow the new arrangements will apply to gas, but the House will wish toknow the decisions \\re have reached so far.These are comprehensive and far-reaching proposals.   They show theGovernment1 s determination to act, and&apos;act quickly, to ensure that we get full national benefit from our newly-discovered wealth.   The oil companies are fully aware that the present system could not continue and will welcome the end of uncertainty which has hung over this operation for two years now.   I am confident that they will be readyto join with us in working out a new structure which they know will be.durable because it will be accepted by the people of Britain.DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY1 July 1974
