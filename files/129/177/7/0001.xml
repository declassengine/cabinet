DEVOLUTION WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOMSOME ALTERNATIVES FOR DISCUSSIONINTRODUCTION1. The Queen&apos;s Speech said that the Government &quot;will initiatediscussions in Scotland and Wales on the report of the Royal Corn-mission on the Constitution, and will bring forward proposals forconsideration&quot;. The purpose of these discussions is to produce a white paper and a Bill. The Prime Minister also made it clear that &quot;theGovernment will, of course, be considering all the recommendations inthe report, but it is in Scotland and Wales that the need for consultationsarises most immediately&quot;. (Hansard, 19 March 1974.) This paper isintended to provide the basis for these consultations which ,will be takingplace not only in Scotland and Wales but also in England.      112. Part I of the paper sets out in summary form the seven mainschemes of devolution put forward in the Majority Report and theMemorandum of Dissent. The Government will welcome any general orspecific comments on these schemes.3. Both separatism and federalism have been rejected, as the RoyalCommission unanimously recommended, but three of the schemes to beconsidered would involve major constitutional change. Of these the schemeof legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales (Scheme A) is describedfirst since this commanded most support from Commission members. It isalso the solution which most clearly distinguishes Scotland and Wales onthe one hand from England on the other and it also raises in the mostacute form issues about the representation of Scotland and Wales in the westminster Parliament and the future of their Secretaries of State. Thesecond and third schemes (B and C below) also envisage an extensivedevolution of power to elected assemblies. They were primarily designedto be applied uniformly to Scotland, Wales and the regions of England,but one of the issues for discussion is whether they can be considered inthe context of Scotland and Wales only. The remaining four schemes(D, E, F and G) all envisage the creation of bodies which are primarilyadvisory and consultative and do not, therefore, raise major constitutional issues, apart from the legislative functions included in Scheme E.4. The different schemes need not, of course, be adopted exactly asthey stand. Indeed, one of the objects of the consultations will be toconsider whether variations in the schemes would overcome some of theproblems they present and also, of course, whether any of the schemes,or possible variants of them, would be an improvement on the present stateof affairs. It is also for discussion whether the same arrangements wouldbe appropriate both for Scotland and for Wales.(&apos;) Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution, October 1973, Cmnd. 5460;Memorandum of Dissent, Cmnd. 5460-1.5150061
5.  Part II of the paper raises a number of specific questions about: (a) the more important practical problems which would need to be resolved in each scheme before it could be made to worksatisfactorily;(b) some of the political, constitutional and administrative implications of the different models.The Government would welcome detailed suggestions and views on these and similar issues, in order to help find a stable and enduring solution.6. Two crucial economic, issues stand out for discussion. One is whether in the area of taxation and public expenditure enough powers could be devolved to Scotland and Wales to enable Scottish and WelshGovernments to make full use of the other powers which the major schemes theoretically give them while at the same time leaving the UnitedKingdom Government with fully adequate economic and financial powersto cope with the problems of demand management and the balance of. payments, including public expenditure allocation and control, and counter-inflation policy. Another issue is that the Kilbrandon scheme for legisla-tive devolution would not give the Scottish and Welsh Governments any significant powers in relation to trade and industry because of therequirements for central control in this field and the obligations assumedunder international agreements. This conclusion has, however, beenquestioned in Scotland and Wales. Specific questions are posed on thesetwo important issues in Part II.7. None of the schemes would be incompatible with United kingdom membership of the European Economic Community, which is currently thesubject of the Governments policy of renegotiation. But, subject to the outcome of that policy, legislative devolution for Scotland and Wales(Scheme A in Part I) would require consideration to be given to arrange-ments for the handling of transferred subjects within the GovernmentsEuropean Community policies; and some account might need to be taken of Community membership in the implementation of any of the other major schemes.8. The Government propose in due course to publish their own proposals for Scotland and Wales in the form of a White Paper which they hope to have ready by the autumn. The present consultations, togetherwith the detailed studies which the Government has put in hand on all theschemes summarised in this paper, are needed to help the Government take decisions. In this connection the Government endorse the view expressedin paragraph 1112 of the Majority Report of the Royal Commission:  &quot;We would expect our Report to lead to public debate and the formulation of a more clearly defined public opinion. Only then willit be right for decisions to be taken. And since opinion is likely still tobe divided, and this is a matter requiring the exercise of politicaljudgement, the final decisions must be political.&quot;
Part ITHE SCHEMES RECOMMENDED IN THE MAJORITY report and THE MEMORANDUM OF DISSENTA. Legislative Devolution for Scotland and Wales9. Legislative devolution was recommended for Scotland by eight of thethirteen members of the Commission and for Wales by six members.(2)General description10. Responsibility for legislating on specifically defined matters wouldbe transferred from the Westminster Parliament to directly elected scottish and Welsh legislatures. In relation to the transferred subjects theselegislatures would make such laws and policies as they saw fit, and would carry out all aspects of administration. The ultimate power and sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament would be preserved in all matters, but itwouldAbe a convention that in the ordinary course this power would not beused to legislate for Scotland or Wales on a transferred matter without theagreement of the Scottish or Welsh Government^3). The United KingdomGovernment would also have the power, for use in exceptional circumstances,to determine, with the approval of the United Kingdom Parliament, that aBill passed by the Scottish or Welsh legislature should not be submitted for the Royal Assent. The Scottish and Welsh executives would be composed of Ministers drawn from their respective assemblies who wouldthen operate the traditional Cabinet system of government. It is the intention that the Scottish and Welsh Governments should have a large measure offinancial independence, especially in matters of expenditure, but would besubject to such restraints as are necessary in the interests of the economicmanagement of the United Kingdom as a whole.Main features of the scheme. 11. Legislative power in the following subjects would be transferredto the Scottish and Welsh legislative assemblies:  Local governmentTown and country planningNew townsHousingBuilding controlWater supply and sewerageAncient  monuments   and  historicbuildingsRoads (including the construction,use and licensing of vehicles)Road passenger transportHarboursOther environmental services (e.g.prevention of pollution, coast pro-tection and flood prevention)Education (probably excluding univer-necessities)Youth and community servicesSports and recreationArts and culture (including the Welshand Gaelic languages)(2)The proposals for legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales are outlined inparagraphs 1125 to 1153 of the Majority Report. The strengths and weaknesses of legislative devolution are discussed in more detail in paragraphs 733 to 826.(3) Majority Report, paragraph 1126.7150061 B* 2
Social work services (including, for Agriculture,   fisheries   and   foodScotland, probation and after-care) (except price support and someHealth other functions)Miscellaneous regulatory functions Forestry(including matters such as betting, Crown estatesgaming, and lotteries, obscene pub- Tourismlications, shop hours and liquorlicensing)12.  Legislative power in the following additional matters would betransferred to the Scottish Assembly only:  Police Legal matters, including law reformFire services Highlands and Islands developmentCriminal policy and administration (including crofting)Prisons Sea transportAdministration of justice13. In the subjects listed above the Westminster Parliament would normally cease to legislate for Scotland and Wales (though existing UnitedKingdom legislation in these fields would continue to apply initially). Butthe United Kingdom Parliament and Government would continue to beresponsible for the international aspects of transferred matters. It is alsoenvisaged that the Scottish and Welsh assemblies might have some limited powers in relation to consumer protection, road freight, civil aviation and broadcasting.14. The legislative assemblies in Scotland and Wales would each have about 100 members directly elected for a fixed term of 4 years by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, though in the moresparsely populated areas of Scotland the alternative vote system might beadopted. All matters relating to the franchise and to elections to the assembly(though not elections to local authorities) would be reserved to the UnitedKingdom Parliament.15. The Scottish and Welsh executives would consist of Ministersdrawn from their respective assemblies. Normally the leader of the majorityparty would be chief Minister (or Premier) and would form a Cabinet whichwould operate in accordance with the traditional Westminster principlesof collective and ministerial responsibility. Scotland and Wales would eachhave a separate civil service.16. Scotland and Wales would continue to be represented in the westminster Parliament, but their representation in proportion to population would be the same as for England. This would probably reduce thenumber of Scottish MPs at Westminster from 71 to about 57; and thenumber of Welsh MPs from 36 to about 31.17. The offices of Secretary of State for Scotland and Wales would disappear, but Scotland and Wales would each have a Minister with thespecial responsibility of representing its interests in the Cabinet.(*)(4) Paragraph 1148 of the Majority Report.
18. There are detailed proposals for finance which the Report says are open to modification.^) The chief object would be to give the Scottish and welsh Governments maximum freedom in expenditure. Each would have its &quot;fair share of United Kingdom resources&quot; and freedom to allocateexpenditure on the transferred services according to its own chosenpriorities.(6) Scotland and Wales might also have some limited powers of independent taxation, and perhaps a share of United Kingdom taxes. Butthe assemblies&apos; income would come mainly from United Kingdom subventions-tions. They might also be able to raise loans to meet capital expenditure.19. The determination of Scotland&apos;s and Wales&apos; &quot;fair share of UnitedKingdom resources &quot; would be in the hands of a nominated Exchequer board which would be independent of the Scottish, Welsh and United kingdom governments. Exceptionally the United Kingdom Government could reject the Board&apos;s recommendation with the approval of the United kingdom parliament.B.  A Scheme for Elected Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the English20. This scheme of intermediate level governments was the mainproposal in the Memorandum of Dissent signed by two members of theCommission^7)General description21. The scheme seeks to achieve a substantial measure of devolution of power from the central Government to Scotland, Wales and the english regions. It could, however, be considered for application to Scotland andWales alone. Under the scheme the United Kingdom Parliament and government would remain responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy on all matters, but directly elected Scottish and Welsh and english regional assemblies would be responsible for adjusting UnitedKingdom policies to the special needs of their areas and putting them intoeffect. The Scottish, Welsh and English regional Governments would be runon the local authority pattern with a functional committee structure and noton the Cabinet model as in the scheme of legislative devolution. They would assume control of all the regional outposts of central Government now operating in their areas including the Scottish and Welsh Offices in theirpresent form and the regional and local offices of other central Governmentdepartments.(8) Thus these outposts, which employ very substantial numbersof civil servants, would be completely &quot; hived off &quot; from central Government.(5) Paragraphs 679 to 693 of the Majority Report describe a scheme of regional financeintended to bring about the maximum degree of regional independence. Paragraphs 775 to 777discuss this scheme in relation to the problems of legislative devolution generally. Paragraphs1134 to 1139 apply it to the Commission^ specific proposals for legislative devolution inScotland and Wales.C6) Majority Report, paragraph 1134.O The scheme is summarised on pages xvi to xx of the Memorandum of Dissent and developed more fully in paragraphs 208 to 276.(8) The term &quot; regional&quot; includes where appropriate, the all-Scotland or all-Wales level.It does not mean the regional level of local government in Scotland; nor that Scotland andWales are to be equated with English regions.Regions
The &quot; intermediate level&quot; governments (j.e. the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments) would also take over completely the functions ofcertain ad hoc authorities operating in their areas (e.g. health and water authorities); and they would be given some supervisory responsibilities inrespect of the activities in their parts of the country of the various industrial and commercial authorities (e.g. gas and electricity boards). The &quot;inter-mediate level&quot; governments would not be limited to the specific functions or duties conferred on them by Parliament; they would have a general residualcompetence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas. They would have some independent revenue-raising powers and sufficient financial &quot; independence &quot; of central Government to give them the requisite degree of freedom to carry out their duties and responsibilities.Main features of the scheme22. The scheme envisages that the broad range of functions set out inparagraph 21 above would be devolved to an assembly and governmentin Scotland, in Wales and in each of, say, five English regions. Eachassembly would consist of about 100 members elected by the single trans-transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of fouryears. The executive of each government would consist of a numberof functional departments or divisions staffed by the authority&apos;s own civilservants. There would be departments or divisions for such functions asFinance, Education, Health and Social Security, the Environment, etc. each department or division would be controlled by a committee drawn fromthe membership of the assembly reflecting the balance of party strengths.23.  Each assembly would be able to make &quot; ordinances &quot;:  (a) to implement United Kingdom policies and legislation and to adaptthem to the special needs of the area; and(Jb) to give effect to their residual power to act for the welfare andgood government of the people in the area.(9)24. Each intermediate level government would have its own civilservice and a separate ombudsman. There would be no change in thefunctions of local authorities, although they would deal with the appropriateintermediate government instead of with the central Government as atpresent. They would have direct representation in the intermediate level governments.(10)25. The general financial arrangements are outlined at the end ofparagraph 21 above. A possible development of these arrangements isoutlined in Appendix B of the Memorandum of Dissent. It is designed togive the intermediate level governments a considerable degree of financialand economic independence of central Government; and to improve the ability of the central Government to achieve the major objectives of national economic policy such as full employment, regionally and nationally, and asatisfactory rate of economic growth.(9) These powers are subject to various safeguards which are set out in paragraphs 242to 245 of the Memorandum of Dissent.(10) Memorandum of Dissent paragraphs 212 and 254 to 255.
26. At the centre, the scheme envisages that Members of Parliament, by being relieved of a great deal of detail, would have time for a much greatershare in Government policy making including more influence on the decisions which United Kingdom Ministers have to take in the Council of ministers in Brussels; for these purposes MPs would need to be organised infunctional committees matching each of the main Departments of Govern-ment. The composition of the House of Lords might be altered to include members of the &quot; intermediate level&quot; governments.27. The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would remain as members of the United Kingdom Cabinet though their existing departments would be taken over by the Scottish and Welsh Governments. They wouldhave the special responsibility of safeguarding and promoting Scottish and welsh interests in all Cabinet decisions. A third Cabinet Minister wouldperform a similar function for the English regions. There would be no reduction in the number of Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster.C. Executive Devolution for Scotland, Wales and Eight English Regions28. This scheme was recommended by two members who signed theMajority Report^11)General description29. The scheme seeks to achieve a substantial measure of devolutionfrom the central Government to Scotland, Wales and the English regions.It is in essence a more restricted and less radical version of the scheme presented at B above. The United Kingdom Parliament and Governmentwould be responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy inall matters, but wherever possible would transfer to directly elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales and eight English regions the responsibility,within that framework, for devising specific policies and executing themand for general administration. The intention would be to promote themaximum amount of regional participation and variation consistent withthe general policy aims of the United Kingdom Government. The two members who support the scheme regard it as an essential feature that itshould be applied in a more or less uniform way throughout GreatBritain.(12) It could, however, like Scheme B above, be considered for application to Scotland and Wales only.30.  Its main differences from Scheme B are:  (a) The assemblies would have no independent revenue raising powers,(ft) The assemblies would not have a residual competence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas.(c) The assemblies would not have the wide ordinance-making powerproposed in Scheme B.(d) The functions of the assemblies would be limited initially and increased in the light of experience; they would not necessarily take over all the existing executive functions of the Scottish Office(u)The scheme itself is outlined in paragraphs 1154 to 1173 of the Majority Report;executive devolution in general is discussed at greater length in paragraphs 827 to 919.(12) Majority Report, paragraph 1155.
and the Welsh Office, nor necessarily all the other outposts of central Government departments operating in Scotland or Wales orin the English regions.(e) The assemblies would not necessarily effect a general take-over ofthe work of the various non-industrial, non-commercial ad ad hoc authorities operating in their areas.(f) The assemblies&apos; relationship with local authorities in their areasmight well be different from that envisaged in Scheme B (seeparagraph 35 below).(g) Scheme C does not recommend any changes in the institutions of central Government.Main features of the scheme31. Scotland, Wales and the eight English regions would each havean assembly of about 100 members directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of four years.Each assembly would administer with as much freedom as possible thelegislation and policies of the United Kingdom Parliament and Government.32. Functions would be conferred on the assembly by the amendmentof existing law and any new legislation relating to specific matters. acts of Parliament would lay down policy in broad terms, authorising theassembly to fill in much of the detail in some cases by statutory instruments.(13) Executive authority would be vested not in Ministers butin the assembly itself, which would delegate much of its authority tofunctional committees, as local authorities now do.(14) The transfer of functions would be a lengthy process, spread over many years. At first the assemblies would have a limited range of powers in matters such asstrategic planning, but these powers would be gradually extended as time went on.(15) Most of the existing executive functions of the Scottish and welsh Offices would be devolved. Almost all subjects would offer somescope for regional involvement.(16)33. The regional assemblies would not have any independent revenueraising powers. They would be financed out of United Kingdom fundsnegotiated direct with the central Government. Their total expenditure would ultimately be for the United Kingdom Government to decide. TheGovernment would also need to be satisfied that each assembly&apos;s proposed allocation of expenditure was broadly consistent with central policies.Subject to this the assembly would make its own expenditure decisions.(17)34. The scheme would not involve any change in Parliamentaryrepresentation, but it envisages that the separate offices of the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would disappear. There would be a minister with general responsibility for regional affairs.(18)(13) Majority Report, paragraph 1156.(14) Majority Report, paragraph 1165.(ls) Majority Report, paragraph 1160.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraph 1157.(17) Majority Report, paragraphs 1157 and 1163.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraphs 1168 to.1169.
35. The relationship between the regional assemblies and local govern-ment could develop in a number of different ways.(&quot;) Three possible waysare described: (a) local authorities could be completely subordinate to the regional government and it would be for each regional government to decide on the distribution of functions between itself and its local authorities;(b) local and regional authorities could each be autonomous in functionsallocated to them from the centre, and could work in parallel; localauthorities would remain accountable for the proper performance oftheir functions to the United Kingdom Government;(c) the relationship between local and regional government could dependon what Parliament considered appropriate in each separate field oflegislation.36. The precise relationship between the regional assemblies andad hoc bodies would depend on a detailed review.(20)D. Welsh Advisory Council37. Three members who signed the Majority Report recommend theestablishment of a Welsh Advisory Council.(21)General description38. The reasoning behind this scheme is that Wales has derived great benefit from the comparatively recent appointment of its Secretary of State,and that the economic and other problems facing the Principality can best be dealt with through the development and retention of that office. So thescheme aims to reconcile the continued existence of the Secretary of Stateand the Welsh Office in its present form with the widely expressed desire for a directly elected assembly to act as the voice of Wales. Accordinglythere would be a directly elected Welsh Council to advise the Secretary ofState and to scrutinise the operation of Government policies and( agenciesin Wales.Main features of the scheme39. The Welsh Advisory Council would be directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation and would consist ofabout 60 members. It would replace the existing nominated Welsh Council.It would have no legislative, executive or administrative powers. Its functions would be to scrutinise, debate and make representations to the Secretary ofState about Government policies and activities in Wales, including theactivities of the nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies operatingthere. It would inevitably be interested in, but would in no sense supervise,the activities of local authorities.(22)40. The Councils scrutiny would range over such matters as the Welsheconomy, employment, major road development and land use proposals,(&quot; Majority Report, paragraphs 831 to 833 and 1158.(20) Majority Report, paragraph 1159.(21)jThe^scheme is set out in the Majority Report, at paragraphs 1174 to 1183.&quot;* HiMajority Report, paragraphs 1175 and 1178.
public services and the Welsh language. It would also hold an annualdebate on the Governments expenditure proposals for Wales.(23) It would operate through standing committees and be financed from the UnitedKingdom Exchequer. It would also have the right to nominate some membersof ad hoc bodies operating in Wales.(24)41. The Secretary of State and other Welsh Ministers would on invitationattend the Council to explain policy, answer criticisms and receive advice.Officials of the Welsh&apos; Office would also be invited to report to the Counciland to answer questions on their activities. Members of Parliament fromWelsh constituencies might attend and speak, but not vote, at the Councilsplenary sessions.(25)E. A Scottish Council with Advisory and Legislative Functions42. One member who signed the Majority Report recommended theestablishment of a Scottish Council with advisory and legislative functions.(26)General description43. There would be a directly elected Scottish Council which would havethe same advisory functions as proposed for the Welsh Council and sum-marised at paragraphs 38 to 41 above. In addition, however, the Scottish Council would have some powers in relation to Scottish legislation. thus it would take the Second Reading, Committee and Report stages of scottish bills referred to it by the House of Commons. Unless a Bill was thenrecalled by the Leader of the House, the Scottish Council would be ableto give it a Third Reading, and submit it for Royal Assent without any reference back to the House of Commons and without any passage throughthe House of Lords.F. Regional Co-ordinating and Advisory Councils for the English Regions44. Eight members of the Commission recommended this scheme for english regional councils with advisory and co-ordinating powers.(27)General description45. The scheme is based on the view that it would not be right for theEnglish regions to be given any legislative or executive powers now exercised by central Government, and that it would be illogical (following the recent reorganisation of local authorities) for them to take over powers from local government. Yet at the regional level it is believed that there isscope for more effective co-operation between local authorities and a needfor more open discussion and democratic influence on those matters affectingthe region which are decided by central Government or by ad hoc bodies.(23) Majority Report, paragraph 1176.(24) Majority Report, paragraph 1178.(25) Majority Report, paragraph 1177.(26)The scheme is described in paragraphs 1184 to 1187 of the Majority Report. It isbased on the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Committee of the Conservative party which are discussed in paragraphs 966 to 975.(27)The scheme is summarised in paragraphs 1195 to 1209 of the Majority Report;paragraphs 920 to 965 discuss in more detail the implications of schemes of this kind.
To meet this need, and to give advice to the central Government on regionalproblems, there would be regional councils primarily composed of localgovernment councillors.Main features of the scheme46. There would be eight English regions (i.e. those that have alreadybeen established for economic planning purposes). Each region would havean advisory council,which would consist of about 60 members. Four-fifths of the members of each council would be members of the local authorities inthe region and would be &quot; elected &quot; by those local authorities to membership of the regional advisory council. One-fifth of the members would be nominated by the central Government to secure representation from industryand commerce, trade unions, education and other interests.47. The regional advisory councils would have no legislative, executiveor administrative powers.  Their functions would be to:  (a) take over the functions of the present nominated regional economic planning councils;(b) advise on Government spending in their regions;(c) advise and make representations to central Government about government policies and activities generally in their regions, includingthe operations of nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies(some of whose members they would nominate);(d) have a mainly co-ordinating function in the field of local government.48. Under (d) it is envisaged that the regional council would play an important part in the formulation of the broad economic and land usestrategy which would be the regional framework within which central andlocal government services would be provided. The structure plans of localauthorities would have to fit into this general strategy and would besubmitted for Ministerial approval through the regional council with itscomments. The council would by agreement promote and co-ordinate action by local government in the region. It would have no power of directionover local authorities in the region and would not itself administer services or undertake works.(28)49. In carrying out their functions the councils would ordinarily meet in public. They would elect their own chairmen.G.  A scheme for Co-ordinating Committees of Local Authorities50. This scheme is recommended for England by one member of theCommission^29)General description51. The scheme is based on the view that in England the best way ofdevolving power from the centre is to concentrate on strengthening thepower of the new larger local authorities. It is envisaged that if this were(z8) Majority Report, paragraph 1204.(29) It is outlined in paragraphs 1210 to 1214 of the Majority Report./     15
done the only need at regional level would be to co-ordinate the planningactivities of local authorities. Instead of the present voluntary co-operationbetween local authorities there would be established a formal system of regional committees. Each would consist entirely of indirectly elected representatives of local authorities and there would be no provision fornominated members. It would be mandatory for local authorities to submit their plans for the regional committee and obtain its comments before submitting them for Ministerial approval. The present economic planning councils would be abolished. It is envisaged that the scheme might be combined with regional committees&quot; of the House of Commons which mightvet regional plans and Government expenditure in the regions.(30)(30) The organisation of the House of Commons on these lines is discussed in paragraphs1050 to 1092 of the Majority Report.
Part IIPOINTS FOR DISCUSSIONA.  The Major Schemes of Devolution (A, B and C)52. Listed below are a number of specific matters on which theGovernment would particularly welcome comment. The questions posed are intended to be illustrative rather than comprehensive. For the sake of convenience they have been grouped together under broad functionalheadings.Finance53. The problem would be to give the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments under these schemes a sufficient degree of financial independence to make full use of the constitutional powers devolved tothem while preserving economic unity and leaving the United KingdomGovernment with fully adequate economic and financial powers todischarge their responsibilities for demand management, the balance ofpayments and the control of inflation. Some of the questions that arise,therefore, are:  (a) Would the financial proposals in the Majority Report and theMemorandum of Dissent give the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments sufficient independence of the centre to make full use of their constitutional powers?(b) Would it be possible to contain the expenditure of independentgovernments within determined limits?(c) Should Scotland and Wales have independent taxation powers; andif so, how extensive should they be and what form should they take?Would it be acceptable that levels of taxation might be higher insome parts of the United Kingdom than in others?(d) How might oil revenues affect the schemes?(e) Would the nominated Exchequer Board (in Scheme A) provide an objective and acceptable way of determining Scotland&apos;s and Wales&apos;&quot; fair share of United Kingdom resources &quot;? Are there acceptablealternatives?(f) Would it be practicable and acceptable to determine a &quot; fair share &quot;by trying to measure average United Kingdom standards in thedifferent services housing, health, education, etc. and then allocatingcentral Government resources to Scotland and Wales so that, if desired, those standards could be secured overall in the serviceslegislatively devolved? What sort of formula and machinery mightbe used for this?(g) Under Schemes B and C, would the intermediate level governments have effective room for manoeuvre in varying the balance of expendi-ture on housing, health, education, etc., in their parts of the countrywhen the central Government would remain responsible for broadpolicy in all parts of the United Kingdom?  Would the regional
communities want greater variations in standards than now exist, or would there be pressure for equality of standards throughout theUnited Kingdom?(h) How far would the answers to these questions about finance beaffected if the application of devolution under Schemes A, B and Cwere confined to Scotland and Wales only?Trade, industry and employment54. The main problem here is whether there could be any significantdevolution of powers in the trade, industry and employment fields to scottish, Welsh and English regional governments. Some of the questions that arise, therefore, are:  (a) Is it acceptable that in Scheme A there would be little devolution ofpowers in the trade, industry and employment fields? If not, what form might such devolution take and what services might be affected,on the basis that distribution of industry policy and industrial incen-tives need to be controlled on a United Kingdom basis and bearing that mind international obligations ?(b) An example of the kind of problem which might arise is that atpresent the salaries and conditions of service of certain publicemployees (e.g. in the National Health Service) in Scotland, Wales and england are kept broadly in line. Under Scheme A Scotland andWales would be able to define their own conditions of service andtheir own salary scales and structures:  (i) Is it acceptable that the present assurance of broad equalitybetween the different parts of the country should go?(ii) What problems would this create for local authorities?(iii) Alternatively, could the scheme for legislative devolution be altered so that the powers of the Scottish and Welsh governments were limited in such a way that they would not have the freedom to alter pay and conditions of service significantly from a standardUnited Kingdom level?(c) Under Schemes B and C the Scottish and Welsh and English regional governments would take over many or all of the trade, industry andemployment activities now undertaken in central Government offices in Scotland and Wales. Is this a practical proposition? Is it possiblein practice to give Scottish, Welsh and English regional governmentssignificant discretionary powers in these fields whilst maintainingcentral control of distribution of industry policy and the benefits ofan integrated United Kingdom market?id) What would be the relationship under the various schemes betweenthe Scottish, Welsh and English regional assemblies and the nationalised industries?(e) Would the scope for devolving trade, industry and employmentfunctions in Schemes B and C be affected if devolution in these fields, were confined to Scotland and Wales?
Local government55. The main problems here revolve round the likely impact of the threeschemes on the powers and functions of local authorities. For example:  (a) Under all three schemes local authorities would mainly be limitedto dealing with the Scottish, Welsh and English regional governments and would cease to deal with the United Kingdom Parliament and central Government departments. And the United KingdomGovernment, of course, would largely cease to have direct dealings with local authorities.  Is this acceptable?(6) Which is preferable of the three types of relationship betweenregional assemblies and local governrilent under Scheme C, described in paragraph 35 above?(c) Under Scheme A Scottish and Welsh Governments would have veryconsiderable legislative powers over the local authorities in their area.Thus, for example, a Scottish and Welsh assembly and governmentcould if they wished:  (i) absorb existing specific grants into the Rate Support Grant system for local authority services or abolish the system, in whole or inpart, and replace it by a system of specific grants;(ii) change the level of Rate Support Grant and the distributionformula;(iii) take to itself the determination of a variety of matters which arenow within the discretion of local authorities, or extend thepresent range of discretion of local authorities.What problems would any of the above points pose for local authorities?(Depending on what powers were developed by the central Government,similar questions might arise under Schemes B and C.)(d) Under Schemes B and C might the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments seek to compensate for their lack of legislativepower by exerting greater control over the activities of localauthorities in their area or by pressing to take over their functions?(e) As far as Scotland is concerned, the local government region ofStrathclyde is very much larger in population terms than any otherregion. What effect would this have on any of the three schemes?General political, constitutional and administrative, issues56. There is a very wide range of political, constitutional andadministrative issues that have to be faced. They would include thefollowing:  (a) What difficulties are foreseen when the Scottish and WelshGovernments are of a different political complexion from the UnitedKingdom Government?(b) Under Scheme A it would, in principle, be open to the Scottish and welsh Governments to exercise a wide range of legislative powers in a distinctive way e.g. it would be theoretically possible for themto re-cast completely the structure and powers of local governmentin their areas, they would be able to abolish private medical practice
or extend and increase health service charges, they would be able tointroduce educational policies quite different from the existing onesincluding, for example, charging fees for attendance at state schools,and they would be able to nationalize or denationalize road passenger transport. Would Scottish and Welsh Governments in practice belikely to exercise such powers; and if so would it be acceptable?(c) What difficulties are foreseen in making the veto power in Scheme Awork effectively?(d) Should all schemes be- based on proportional representation as recommended by the Royal Commission?(e) Under Scheme A is it acceptable to the people of England that whilethe Westminster Parliament would in general not be able to legislate for Scotland and Wales in matters of health, education, local govern-ment, etc., some 90 Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster would participate in legislation for England on these matters?(/) Under Scheme A is it acceptable to the people of Scotland and Walesthat their number of MPs at Westminster should be reduced? (Thisis not an essential element in legislative devolution, but it is includedin the majority recommendation.)(g) Under all three schemes is it acceptable to the people of Scotlandand Wales that their Secretaries of State would disappear in theirpresent form? Even if they were retained, they would have more limited powers and would not have the support of strong departments.(h) Is it acceptable that divergency of policies e.g. on housing, health,education, town and country planning etc. might arise to asignificantly greater extent than is possible at present?(0 Under Schemes B and C how, in practice, can one draw a distinctionbetween major policy making (which would be the responsibility of central Government) and subordinate policy making and administra-tion (which would be the responsibility of intermediate level governments)?(/) Under Schemes B and C would the United Kingdom Government inpractice be able to enforce its broad policies on a politically hostileintermediate level government?(k) How should regional governments be organised? Scheme A envisagesa Cabinet system of government and Schemes B and C the localauthority pattern.(/) Under Scheme B would the ordinance-making power of intermediate level governments lead to the development of separate andfundamentally different bodies of ordinance-made law in Scotland,Wales and the English regions which might seriously undermine the concept of the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom?(m) Under Schemes B and C would the central Government be undulyhandicapped in its major policy-making responsibilities when, since it would no longer be responsible for adnnmstering existing policies, itwould lack the practical knowledge that comes from that?(w) Is there a demand in England for an additional level of directly elected assemblies (as in Schemes B and Q, and would such bodiesattract electoral support?
(o) Would it be acceptable to apply Schemes B and C to Scotland andWales only? If this were done, would it be necessary for muchUnited Kingdom legislation to be enacted in two forms, one (merelylaying down broad policy) applying to Scotland and Wales and theother (in greater detail) to England? Would such an arrangement beworkable and acceptable?(p) Under Schemes B and C, it would still be necessary to enactspecifically Scottish legislation in the United Kingdom Parliamentbecause of the different system of Scottish law. How would such legislation be handled; which United Kingdom Minister would be incharge of Scottish Bills; and how would!he be advised and supported,given that the existing Scottish Office would be responsible to theScottish assembly?(q) Issues might arise which would lead to Scottish and Welsh legisla-tion being challenged in the courts on grounds of ultra vires. would it be necessary to establish a special constitutional court to dealwith these questions and, if so, how should it be composed?(r) To what extent would it be necessary to establish special machineryfor securing inter-governmental co-operation and consultation? Anincrease in the total number of public servants is likely. Would this be acceptable? How would the burdens on Whitehall and West-minster be affected?(s) What problems are involved in making the boundaries of such bodiesas regional health and water authorities and the Gas Councilcoterminous with the boundaries of Wales and the English regions?To what extent do the regional boundaries proposed in Schemes Band C accurately reflect regional sentiment?B. Schemes D, E, F and G57. The issues which arise under Schemes D, E, F and G are forthe most part of a different order from those so far presented. This is because although they all involve the creation of assemblies of various kinds those assemblies would be for the most part advisory and consulta-tive. They would not have specified powers either with respect to localauthorities or over any matters now the responsibility of central Govern-ment. Schemes D and E are for Wales and Scotland respectively whileF and G are for eight English regions.58. As far as Schemes D and E are concerned the points on which theGovernment would welcome comments include the following:  (a) How far would these schemes go towards meeting practical needs and fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Scotland and Wales?(b) Would enough able men and women be ready to face directelections and give up a substantial amount of time to serve on theScottish and Welsh assemblies envisaged in these schemes? Wouldsome degree of indirect election be acceptable?(c) Would the schemes be likely to increase the burdens on Whitehalland Westminster?
id) What problems are raised by the fact that the Scottish and welsh offices and the ad hoc bodies in Scotland and Wales would besubject to detailed questioning by the Scottish and Welsh assembliesbut would remain accountable only to the United Kingdom parliament and Government?(e) How, under these schemes, would the role and responsibilities of welsh and Scottish MPs be distinguished from the role and responsi-bilities of the Welsh and Scottish assemblies?(f) What problems are raised by the legislative role envisaged inScheme E for the Scottish assembly?59. As far as Schemes F and G are concerned the points on whichthe Government would welcome public reaction include the following:  (a) How far would these schemes go towards meeting practical needs and fulfilling regional aspirations?(b) Both schemes assume that as many functions as possible will be devolved from central Government to the new and enlarged localv  authorities.   What additional functions could be devolved?(c) Would the schemes increase or decrease the load on Whitehalland Westminster?(d) Would Schemes F and G strengthen local government and improveits relations with the central Government; or would they set up anadditional barrier between local and central Government?(e) Would the councils proposed in Scheme F be an adequate replace-ment for the regional economic planning councils? Would thelatter still be needed if Scheme G were adopted?CONCLUSION60. This paper is in no sense a substitute for the Majority report and the Memorandum of Dissent. There the schemes are presented in which more detail and the pros and cons of each carefully examined. Thishas already led to much public discussion particularly in Scotland andWales. The purpose of this paper is to carry these discussions a stage further. It is designed as a working document to concentrate discussionwith representative bodies and among the public at large on the practical problems which still have to be solved before any of the various schemesput forward by the Commission on the Constitution could become apractical proposition. And it aims, too, to focus particular attention onthe political and constitutional and administrative implications of the various schemes.61. Anyone who wishes to express a view should do so in writing assoon as possible. Letters should be addressed, as appropriate, to the scottish office or the Welsh Office or (in the case of England) to the Departmentof the Environment.June 1974Printed in England by Her Majcsty&apos;s Stationery Office3150061   Dd 502914  K160  5/74
