ICUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74)67 COPY NO   0 :,0 12 July 1974CABINET 11GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON COLLECTIVE BARGAININGAFTER THE ABOLITION OF PAY controls memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment.        I was invited (CC(74) 20th Conclusions, Minute 2) to circulate for clearance by my Cabinet colleagues a revised draft of the government statement to be made when the draft Order to abolish the statutory paycontrols is laid before Parliament.    The attached draft takes account ofcomments from my colleagues on the earlier version, which has beenshortened to the form of an oral statement, rather than a White Paper.The main changes have been to omit the rehearsal of measures already takenby the Government under the social contract, and the section on theeconomic outlook which is less appropriate for an oral statement.by me.2.        The draft is still rather too long for an oral statement and alsolacking in new substance.    My present view therefore is that a statement on these lines would be better made during the debate on the draft Orderlater this month, rather than as a statement when the Order is laid.This later timing would also make it possible for the statement to followrather than precede the proposed announcement by the Secretary of Statefor Prices and Consumer Protection of the arrangements for her reviewof the Price Code.3.        The draft Order is to be laid as soon as the Prices Bill receivesRoyal Assent - on present plans on or about Monday 8 July.    It could be debated in both Houses about a week to ten days later, subject to inter-vening consideration by the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation.This timing could slip by several days if we were to run into difficulties with the Prices Bill in the Lords, and I very much hope we can avoid this.4.        I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; approval to speak on the lines ofthe attached draft during the Commons debate on the draft Order, hopefullyin the week commencing 15 July.    A similar statement would be made inthe Lords debate.M department of Employment2 July 1974
(confidential)&apos; \: .  .... annex draft ORAL STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR employment on COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AFTER THE ABOLITION OF PAY CONTROLSI wish to make a statement on the preparations the Governmenthas been making for the abolition of compulsory pay controls.    Adraft Order under the Prices Bill has now been laid for thispurpose,  and subject to its approval by both Houses,  the statutorycontrols will have disappeared before the end of this month.TRANSITION TO VOLUNTARY SYSTEM -. In the interests of securing an orderly transition to a&apos;voluntary system we have tried, within the limits imposed by the counter-Inflation Act,  to mitigate the worst of the anomalies towhich the pay controls have given rise.    Consents have been issued in a number of cases.    Special reviews have been set up for the nurses and teachers;  and negotiations have been allowed to proceedfor Post Office workers and,  in the light of the Pay Board reporton London Weighting,  to deal with the special circumstances ofthose on national rates of pay who are working in London.    Thelong-standing problems of railway and London Transport pay willalso have to be resolved following the current arbitrations.With.arrangements made for these particularly hard cases&apos;,  theGovernment look to other people not to re-opeiv settlements but toabide by the guidance given by the General Council of the TUC thatthe 12 month interval before major increases should generally bemaintained.    Unless it is,  all our policies within the social contract on rents,  food subsidies, pensions and the rest,  will bein jeopardy and we would lose any chance of bringing theintolerable rate of inflation under control. . As to those whosuggest this might lead to a new freeze,  I would ask how they would deal with all the fresh anomalies to which, that would give rise.    Afreeze is not a solution and I say there is a better way.Certainly we must avoid a general wage explosion.    However,resumption of voluntary collective bargaining should better enableemployers and unions to make settlements suited to theircircumstances and conducive to the increase of output and efficiency.    Within the framework of this system and to help itwork more, effectively we propose to establish two new institutions:the Conciliation and Arbitration Service and the Royal Commissionon the Distribution of Income and Wealth.CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION service the Conciliation and Arbitration Service will be managed and developed by an independent Council,,includingrrepresentatives ofthe TUC and CBI.    It will provide conciliation and arbitrationservices which are freely and readily available both nationallyand locally and it will seek to develop and improve collective1(confidential)
bargaining machinery.    Both the TUC and CBI have welcomed thecreation of such a service and have agreed to give it their full support.    Arrangements for its establishment are well advanced andthe Government aim to have it in full operation by / 1 Septemberunder the chairmanship of  - %..    ^__^      .        .......royal^IOjiS SsfoF .................The Royal Commission has a different role.    The Governmentare determined to help create a fairer society and as a first step towards this we need to establish in a much more thorough and,comprehensive way than has been attempted hitherto, the factsabout the distribution of incomes and wealth of all kinds -earned and unearned.    The Government envisage the Royal Commissionranging over the whole field,  on the basis of references made toit by the government   producing reports of a factual nature whichwill assist and inform policy makers and those who are active incollective bargaining.    The Commission will thus have a wide     ,,educationai^and indicative function.    The Government intend toset it up./, at about the same time as the pay controls dire &apos;abolished,  under the chairmanship of ^jf&apos; &apos;&apos;TUC RESPONSE :&quot;With the .restoration of voluntary collective bargaining iiritsight the General Council on 26 June issued their report onCollective Bargaining and the Social Contract giving guidance  &apos;for union negotiators for the period after the abolition of statutory controls.    We warmly welcome this constructive responseby the TUC to the measures already taken by the Government.!In this report,  the TUC recognise that although thegroundwork is being laid for increasing consumption and living standards in the future,  the scope for real increases in consumption at present is limited,  and a central negotiatingobjective in the; coming period will therefore be to ensure thatreal incomes are maintained.    They suggest this will entailclaiming compensation for the rise in the cost of;iliving sincethe last settlement,  taking into account that threshold agreementswill already have given some compensation for current price increases.    Alternatively,  they suggest negotiating arrangements to keep up with the cost of living during the period of the new agreement.    They stress that it is important that the twelvemonth interval between major increases should in general continueto apply.    Within these central aims,   they recommend that priority should be given to negotiating agreements which will havebeneficial effects on unit costs and efficiency,  to reformingoutdated pay structures,   to improving job security and non-wagebenefits,  to eliminating discrimination against particular groups(for example by equal pay) and to attaining reasonable minimum standards,  including the target of a  25 minimum weekly rate.
(confidential)The General Council say they will be;,keeping : the situation     ^under review,  and will expect unions who have difficulty inconforming to the spirit of this policy to inform the general council of the circumstances and to seek their advice,  or to respond to an invitation to discuss the situation with them.THE GOVERNMENT1 S POSITIONHowever,  it is not possible to retain the proper balance inthe tuc&apos;s statement in a short summary.    I invite Members to readit as a whole.    The Government welcome it as an extremely important statement responding to the requirements of the national situation in a clear and helpful fashion.The CBI have issued no statement but I understand that theyhave welcomed much of what the TUC have said and,   in general,  theabolition of pay controls.    They have pressed only for theretention of the  12 month rule on a statutory basis.    But I haveto say to them that, while everyone is agreed that the 12 monthrule should continue to apply,  and the TUC have given itparticular emphasis in their recommendations,  it would be quiteout of the question to retain the Pay Board and the wholeapparatus of pay control,   simply on this one point.We recognise that the TUC guidance applies equally to thepublic and to the private sector and there must be no discrimination.As an employer,   the Government will seek to reach responsiblesettlements along similar lines through the existing procedures for determining public service pay.On the particular question of equal pay,  it is necessary to remember that the Equal Pay Act - introduced by an earlier Labouradministration - will come into force in December 1975.    Everyagreement or pay structure must meet the requirements of the Actby that date.    So all concerned with pay determination should bearin mind the need to make steady and orderly progress towards fullimplementation of equal pay by the end of next year.For months,   even years past,  the rate of inflation facing ushas presented grave dangers and growing tensions;  yet to attemp-jbto curb it too crudely or dramatically could produce massunemployment.    In the presence of these perils,  coupled with thehuge gap in the balance of payments and the urgent demand for more exports and investment,  there can be no room in the yearahead for a general improvement in the standard of life.    even with the measures for the fairer distribution of the national wealth which this Government is determined to pursue,  it willtake great exertion and intelligent co-operation throughout thewhole community to prevent the standard of life from falling andto ensure that the poorest are not hit hardest by the inflation.It is necessary to state these facts in order to be able tograpple with them..   3 &apos;(confidential)
however,  the removal of the pay controls and a return to asystem of consent is hot a negative measure.&apos;  This is somethingprogressive employers no less than the unions have wanted,  and it,can play a major part in enabling us to increase production,  avoicjindustrial disputes,  restore genuine collective bargaining and generally unleash anew the democratic vigour of our society.
