THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVEBNMENTC(74) 51 COPY NO 8122 May 1974CABINETCONCORDENote by the Secretary of State for industry i am submitting the attached paper as an aide memoire summarising the arguments I advanced at the Ministerial Committee on Concorde.A W BDepartment of Industry22 May 1974
ANNEXCONCORDE - AIT AIDE MEMOIREAttitudes to ConcordeNo member of the Cabinet now thinks Concorde should have been started;   and all would agree that it would be convenient if the project could end without unpleasant and expensive consequences.But it cannot be dealt with on that:basis because of the widefinancial, industrial, legal and international implications.The Gravity of the Decision  .Britain has already spent  545 million to date and if the highestdamages estimate,  150 million, were actually added to the  120 millicancellation costs it could cost  270 million to end it - making thetotal spend over  800 million for which Britain would have nothing/whatsoever ..
whatsoever to show.     Concorde having been maintainedunder Labour Governments for 6 years and Tory governments for another 6 could thus be an  8Q0 million write off with grave political consequences none could foresee., : \ V. IIThree Basic ChoicesVarious options were considered.   They reducedthemselves to three:-(1)     to probe the French under their newPresident to discover their attitude to all the options we have identified.All the evidence however sMll points toa determination by France to go on.(2)     To continue with the 16 at a total costof  360-400 million;(3)     to rupture the programme instantly andunilaterally by stopping all U.K. work at once at cancellation costs of -i20m witha risk of damages of up togi^cm making atotal of  270 million./Financial ..2
Financial AspectsNo-one doubts the cost and risk of continuation.All R&amp;D spent is finally lost, production losseswould be heavy, British Airways anticipate operatinglosses though this depends upon assumptions of farestructure and load factor. But the effective differencebetween continuing and selling the rest of the 16 orcancelling with full damages involves a figure that could be as narrow as  90 million spread over 5 years or  18 million a year. let that  18 million a year wouldmean the difference between a rupture or the full 16.Legal AspectsThe Attorney&apos;s opinion is that we could argue, and hope to succeed in arguing,that a fundamental change of circumstances affecting marketability might bepleaded in any arbitration for. damages if we ruptured theprogramme and the risk of these damages might, if we failed, amount to from  100- 150 million.The Attorney&apos;s opinion involves these risks:-/(D ..3
that 16 have already been authorizedby HMG, and therefore the Frenchcould argue that BMG was not onlybreaking its partnership with thembut also reversing its own viewduring a period when the prospectshad deteriorated,but not so much(since 1972) as to justify the argument about a fundamental change intwo years;if marketability is the key then it canonly be tested by entry into service as president Giscard   D&apos;Estaing said in theFrench Election and the British PrimeMinister (who knew all the facts) saidas recently as February 1974- during our election;if we threaten     rupture, subject to arbitration in our favour, the projectgoes on during a long arbitration bywhich time the 16 will be nearercompletion at costs approaching the full cost
(4)     if we rupture unilaterally and the arbitration takes place against thatbackground, the risks of maximum damagesof perhaps  150 million wpuld be run inaddition to  120 million cancellationcharges making  270 million in all.Anglo-French RelationsThese are of importance to us at this time, and point to completion of 16.     The least we should do is to resume the probe of French intentions on all the options -without reaching a secret decision first - as would have happened if the French elections had not occurred, before we reach our view..The Broad ChoiceThe decision we have to make is a broad political onetaking into account all these factors and some othersset out below, any or all of which we should bear in mindaccording to the weight we attach to them./(D ..5
6SECtETConcorde is the finest aircraft ever builtConcorde&apos;s flight test programme is well advanced, andthere is every likelihood that it will meet itsspecification in full.    If we go on, Concorde willenter service as the most thoroughly and seveaaLy testedcivil aircraft ever. !lThe finest skills in Britain and France have -HHflflDtflbeen poured into it for half a generationThe men and women did not ask to build it.   It was started and sustained by successive governments asan act of policy.   There is no guarantee that thesecpstly skills can be rapidly reabsorbed into useful work.All new technologies are costly to launchas with space, nuclear energy and defence technologywhich were never judged by economic criteria like this.Spin off may include land and1 sea applications for theOlympus 593-Supersonic travel is here to stayThe Russians expect the TU 144 to enter into servicenext year.   The U.S. will re-enter the market any day.Supersonic military aircraft are in service world-wide.&apos;.&apos;. //V.The huge available market for civil aircraft estimatedat  25,000 million from 1970-1985 will include a market for supersonics.
Future orders are really possible for ConcordeIranair is seriously interested.     Theconfirmation now of the 16 could produce more orders even before entry into servicewhen U.S. Mr Lines will face the competition for the first time - losing first classpassengers to British Airways and Air FranceConcorde.The Cancellation of Concorde would do irrepairabledamage to britain&apos;s credibility as a reliablepartner in collaborative ventures.350 firms now have 1,000 collaborativearrangements in operation.   All futureaircraft and engine projects of any size will becollaborative and our reputation heremeans hard cash everywhere.The reputation of British engineering wouldbe gravely damaged by a ruptureConcorde is the, only product Britain makes thatis supremely better than anything else on offerin the world.     Exporters of engineering products would be affected if Concorde went.
A rupture - involving an estirabed 154- thousand reAndanciesovernight would have no parallel in British-industrial experience.       The closures of railways, pits and steel works were alwaysphased after notice.     Big business nowusually plans a rundown.To lock the  gatesand stop work at a stroke - as rupture mustmean - would rightly condemn the Governmentto severe criticism at least and active, andat worst      sustained, industrial oppositionbecause the workers would see themselves as defending their skill and craft and thedignity of their labour.A rupture would involve flatly rejecting theadvice of the Trades Union Congress and^specially of the C.S.E.U. whose members are most concernedTrade union representations have all argued thecase for completing the 16 on broad grounds andnot on narrow employment grounds.   The gravity of their representations must be emphasized./do) ..
SECKET(10)      A cancellation by rupture would impose a severe psychological shock to the British nationWe shall never know precisely how our peoplefeel about Concorde uiitil it really is cancelled.I would estimate that after the steady decline of recent years in our fortunes this mightbe the final straw in self-derrgration.   Andif the French went on with it flying our Concordeunder the Tricolour alone the wound would notquickly heal.(11)      The political effects of cancellation wouldbe very ;seriousWe are a minority Government due for anotherelection.     No-one should suppose that theeffects of cancellation could be confined toBristol.   That City shocked and stunted by theblow would be up in arms and three seats willbe at risk.   But with UCS to remind uswhat a national and international impact therecan be and the Opposition launching a majorattack, the trouble will spread and persist.9
(12)      Common sense tells us to finish what we have started and see Concorde into service it is this argument to which I attach themost weight of all - and, it sums up everyargument above.   The British people know Concordeis a very expensive gamble.   But how are we toexplain to a nation that gambles  1,200 millionevery year that the risk of what might be as little as  18 million extra every year for; five years, justifies writing off perhaps over  800* million spent and to be spent to scrap an aircraft which Britain has devoted 12 years ormore to making,allwLthin  18 months of itsi.maiden commercial passenger flights?CONCLUSIONFor these reasons I think it would be wrong to rupturethe programme now.     Accordingly I recommend to my colleagues that: -(1)     I should be authorized to probe the intentions of the new French Government on all the options,in good faith, before we reach any decisionwhatsoever, secret or public;
^FfRETi^t ika ^ b^s. lj il(2)    I should, unless the French suggest or assent to cancellation by agreement, forthwith agree thatwe shall complete the 16 now in production, seekentry into service as soon as possible, ifnecessary by the end of 1975 with a joint Anglo/French fleet linking BA to AF for this purpose;and,(3)    I should announce this decision as soon aspossible to end the uncertainty, and give Concordethe chance it deserves to prove itself in service.A.W.B.DEPARTMENT GF INDUSTRY22   MAY 1974
