DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO    0 a6 future APPROACH TO PUBLIC SECTOR PAY negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. The attached note by officials considers the implications of thecoming voluntary pay arrangements for the Governments relationship withother public sector employers over pay negotiations.    Paragraphs 19-20contain their recommendations.2.        The recommendation that we should g*t Stage 3 settlements incurrent negotiations wherever we can accords with the line that we havetaken from the beginning that it is desirable to keep settlements in thecurrent pay round on much the same basis.    So does the recommendation that we should do all that we can to prevent any major breach of the12 months rule by the coal or electricity industries at the opening of the round in the autumn.    Exactly how we achieve this latter objective is something that officials will need to consider carefully with the employersafter the voluntary guidance is publicly known.3.        I am extremely anxious that we do not get involved in the detailedpay negotiations of other public sector employers.    That is their business and they must get on with it.    Nor must we do anything to suggest that weare discriminating against the public sector - or for it.    But the public sector is not like the private sector in its general relationship toGovernment and it would be absurd not to recognise this in relation to pay as we do to other aspects of their operations.    It is in their interest andours that there should be a close exchange of views well in advance of eachmajor pay negotiation, so that we can see where it may lead in terms ofimpact on related negotiations, prices, subsidy and possible industrialtrouble.4. ,       I therefore invite my colleagues to endorse the recommendations in the report, including the suggestion in paragraph 20 for meetings withthe nationalised industry chairmen collectively and with local authorityemployers.    When those meetings have set the scene, I propose to askofficials to make early arrangements to assess with the employersconcerned the prospects and problems in each of the major public sectornegotiations of the autumn.1C(74) 5818 June 1974CABINET

(confidential)FUTURE APPROACH TO. PUBLIC SECTOR PAY negotiations note by Officials;THE problem the TUC are expected to produce by the end of June guidance to unions on pay negotiations after the abolition of the statutorycontrols some time in July.    Unions will be asked to follow thisguidance in the public as in the private sector and,  as the TUCresponse to Government action under the social contract,  theGovernment will.presumably welcome the guidance,  announce theirown intention to follow it as an employer,  and invite other employers to do so too.2.      Two questions then arise(a) what should be the Government1s approach to the majorpublic sector pay negotiations due before the currentpay round ends in November? .       &apos;(b) what general relationship on pay negotiations should beimaintained between Government and other&quot;public sectoremployers, under the voluntary arrangements?COMING MAJOR PUBLIC SECTOR NEGOTIATIONS-     : - ;   ^ - &apos; &apos;[3.      Annex 1 lists the major public sector pay negotiations withsettlement dates in the period July to Decem er.    The first group are those who have yet to complete negotiations in this round.It would be desirable; to have these completed on Stage 3 linesso as to avoid, the possibility of anomalies arising between themand others who have so settled.    Government have earlier said    &quot;.&quot;that,  iu the interests of; a smooth transition, pay settlements in the rest of this pay round should be at a level which doesnot go beyond the many settlements already made.4.      Since the TUC will intend their guidance to run from the endof the statutory controls and will not accept, ;that Stage 3 should apply^to;negotiations thereafter,  this will mean trying to getas many&apos;as possible of these settlements :madecon1 Stage&quot; 3 linesbefore !the statutory controls end.    There are good chances ofthis&apos;with a number of those listed in the Annex, but hot perhapswith the local authority non-manual workers and police, whosehandling we shall have to consider when the TUC guidelines are known.1   If they purport to follow those guidelines, we must aim to rsee that they keep within them and do not use them to supportexcessively high settlements which get the new voluntary approachoff to a ta^ start&apos;/ &apos;   ^J^,,&apos;5.      From that point qf..view.,.the Government have already laidthe groundwork for&apos;treating, the fresh settlements which will comefor teachers, nurses.and Post Office staff as a backlog of the    pastrather than related to the voluntary approach.    We shall have to try to take a similar line with the rail and London Transportsettlements when the current arbitration hearings finish.    But    itmust be the objective to avoid re-opening other major public sectorsettlements eg for the electrical power engineers and especially(confidential)
confidential the miners.    If the latter were to have a fresh settlement from1 November,  this would put tremendous pressure on other, union .leaders to breach the 12. months, rule and wouldV in particular, make itimpossible to prevent the electricity, manuals from coming forward to September.    Two such breaches of the 12 months rule could wreckthe voluntary approach.6.      If the 12 months rule is held in these cases,  the first majortest of the voluntary regime in the public sector will come with* the&apos;r&apos;l&apos;6cal authority manuals in late-September/October. &quot;Thissettioment will set the tone, for the NHS ancillaries and watermanuals who normally follow their lead.    Along with the construction industry (which negotiates about the same time)  the local 1authority employers and unions, will therefore play a key role in establishing the voluntary regime.NEED FOR CLOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS ..7- This raises the question of the Government&apos;s relationship with the local authority and other public sector employers underthe voluntary arrangements.    It-.is- tempting&apos; to think that public sector employers - the government   nationalised industries andlocal authorities - can be left each to interpret the TUC guidancet^j unions and CBI guidance to employers in their separate negotia-tions.&apos; But we believe that there must be informal arrangementsfor close advance consultation between them oh major negotiationsfor the following reasons. v.. A,8*      First,  the Government are counting on the TUC to get unions to follow their guidance in both the public and private sectors,,but this requires that employers co-operate in not making offersinconsistent with that guidance.    The voluntary arrangements willnot be sustained if broken in the public sector  (which containskO per cent of those affected by nationally negotiated payagreements&apos;) V -,.  :1      -9.      Secondly,  any voluntary guidance is bound to leave room forinterpretation.    Comparability is a very strong force in the public sector and early settlements in one part of it exert substantialinfluence over the others.    It is therefore in the interests ofpublic employers to see,that they take much the same line in negotiation on pay issues where a particular interpretation couldbe repercussive. &quot;&apos; &apos;&apos; v10.    Thirdly,  there is the Government&apos;s position as financier and itsconcern with the impact on public expenditure. : Pay accounts forsome 30 perl cent of total public expenditure,  and for about half ofthe defence budget- and of expenditure on education, health and otherpersonal social&quot; services..    Movements in public sector pay can makea bxg: impact on public expenditure and the borrowing requirement in any one year (l per cent on all forms of &quot;public sector pay costs 150m in a full year)o    The pay of local authority employeesaccounts for about half of the total local authority expenditure and is thus.by far the major determinant of the rate support grant and of the level of rates.CONFIDENTIAL
(confidential)11,    And in the last resort the Government cannot stand alooffrom the conduct of particular public sector pay negotiationswhen there is a considerable risk that they may lead either toa high!-&quot;- inflationary settlement and/or to industrial actiondamaging to the community.PROPOSED RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS12.    l/ithin the voluntary situation we see therefore a need forthe Government to have a close relationship with other public sector employers in the following ways:(a) The Government will need to keep up to date information on what is happening to pay under the voluntary arrangements.It will therefore need to maintain a system of information about the timing,  progress and other inter-relationshipsof significant public (and private)  sector negotiations;and will need to secure information from public sector. employers  (as from key private sector employers),on thelevel of settlements ultimately made.    This will require an understanding with the employers concerned on a commonmethod of measuring the settlements,       .        .-:(b) On critical pay issues which repercuss throughoutthe public sector and where the voluntary guidance is notexplicit,  the Government will have to establish a commoni   interpretation for use by Government negotiators.     (Thekind of questions likely to need such interpretation areillustrated in Annex 2),    The Government should take the lead in informally and confidentially exchanging viewson. these, points of interpretation with-other public sector employers in the interests of avoiding repercussiveinconsistencies of approach. --  (c).-   Where pay has a significant impact on prices and/ora. Government financed deficit, pub7 i-c sector employers should consult the Government on the level,and nature of settlement likely to be necessary,   so that the implications for prices and/or    the subsidy can be taken into account.These requirements suggest that the Government should arrangeinformal,  confidential and advance consultation with other public sector employers on&apos;each major pay, negotiation well before itbegins.    This will also help the Government to see where industrial relations problems may arise and to consider how they might be averted.13.    It would be desirable to fit these consultations into asystem in which pay objectives could be looked at in relationto their&apos;impact on other aspects of the activities and finances of the public sector employer concerned.    For the foreseeable future- the..approach to this through the financial targets for nationalised industries is not available;  and the system of planning agreements will not apply in time to offer such a framework in the coming pay round (although corporate planning in some nationalised    industries already embodies much of the planning agreement approach).    It will, however, be necessary    tore-define the Government&apos;s position on nationalised industryprices, which will clearly have a bearing on pay,  and officialswill be considering this.(confidential)
&apos; &apos;,. -;   -\;;; confidentiall4o    In present circumstances we suggest that(a) arrangements should\ be made for advance informalconsultation,  for.the purposes suggested in paragraph12 above,, with the employer involved in any keypublic sector pay.negotiation.    Subject to thatconsultation - which should help to establish hispay strategy in relation to his other objectives -the employer would be left discretion to conducthis negotiationso    Unless damaging industrial actionproves likely,   there would be no detailed inter-vehtion by Government;  and that(b) in order to set pay in a wider framework&quot;, whendiscussion of the corporate plan next comes up in; eelch case or the planning agreement approach applies,the pay assumption made over the year ahead andtheir prioe/investment/subsidy implications shouldbe discussed as a forerunner td the exchanges at(a).re-actions of other public sector employers15o    The establishment of these arrangements will need careful handling, ,iAlthough public sector employers in deficit arelikely to want to seek advance confirmation from government before their - ay negotiations that they will be allowed eitherto raise prices or to receive an increased Government subsidy to cover the pay increase negotiated,  they are likely to besuspicious about a request for advance consultation on their negotiations lest this represent interference with theirmanagerial responsibility.    They have been restive in the pastabout Government intervention in the conduct of their pay negotiations and are bound to urge that we must not createany feeling of discrimination against the public sector  (though,as Annex 3 shows,  there has been no ground for&apos;a generalaccusation of this kind over the last 3 years).l6o    However,  it will be essential to avoid giving the impression,particularly through the exchange of views on the interpretation of the voluntary guidance,  that the Government, are trying to run a tighter policy for the public sector than applies , :        ;generally.    In relation to their own employees the Governmentwill no doubt want to state publicly that there will bo no discrimination;  and it will certainly be.- necessary,  in. framinginterpretation of critical issues, in the TUC guidance,. that this(a)  should be broadly in line with such confidential     7guidance on these issues as the TUC and CBI may be giving to unions and employers;   ,CONFIDENTIAL
(confidential)(b) should not be regarded as inflexible rules, but be.   capable of adaptation to particular cases:(c) should be confidential,  as as to allow room for manoeuvre in oases of difficulty.17-    We have to remember,  of course,  that in the last resortinterpretation of TUC guidance where it is hot explicit i&apos;slikely to emerge from the independent CAS through the settlements that they bring about through conciliation or.....arbitration.    Public sector employers ,and unions wi.il have access to the independent CAS like any others,  if they cannotreach a negotiated agreement,18.    LOCAL AUTHORITY EMPLOYERS.    The attitude of localauthorities will depend to- a large extent on the measuresagreed,  at Government instigation,  to strengthen the positionof LACSAE,  their national negotiating body.    Given the impactthat the current local authority non-manual negotiations andthe manual negotiations in the- autumn will have on public &apos;   (acceptance of the voluntary arrangements,  it will b;eextremely important to get&apos; local authority co-operationi    a reasonably consistent application of the TUC guidance.This will particularly be required iri handling the payrationalisation problems arising from the re-organisationof local government.    This problem extends to the NHS aswell,  and calls for central management by LAC SAB, with ;,Government guidance,  instead of allowing individual localauthorities to act separately.    Officials are consideringseparately what might be done on this particular problem.CONCLUSIONS19-    We recommend that(i)    the Government should try to get Stage 3 settlements in current negotiations before the statutorycontrols  end,   in order to avoid anomalies with thosewho have settled earlier.    Where this may not bepossible - as with the local authority non-manualsand the police - the Government should seek toensure that the negotiators keep within the TUCvoluntary guidance;(ii)    the Government should seek to avoid breaches of the12 months rule in the autumn by miners and electricity supply manuals and power engineers lest these wreckthe voluntary approach5(iii)      the Government should base their approach in pay negotiations as employer on the TUC guidance to unions.Officials should prepare guidance for Governmentnegotiators on pay issues where the voluntary guidanceleaves room for interpretation and where inconsistenttreatment would be repercussive in the public sector;(confidential)
CONFIDENTIAL(iv)    the Government should arrange-with nationalised industryand local authority employers the.confidential andadvance exchange of views oh the--likely level and natureof coming major public sector pay settlements.    these consultations should serve the purposes proposed in ... ,paragraph 12 above;  but when the time Comes the! Governmentshould try to set increases in&apos;pay in th*r wider frame-    . .work of discussion of corporate plans or planning/agreements.,    Officials will be considering the necessaryre-definition of the Government&apos;s&apos;position on nationalised industry pficesj  which will also be relevant,20o    If Ministers accept these recommendationsj  we suggest thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (accompanied by the &quot;Secretary, of.;State for Employment)  snould see the nationalised chairmen collect-ively to explain the basis on which the Government propose toproceed&apos;with them in the voluntary situation and to seek their &apos;      .,agreement to the consultations proposed.    The Secretaries of Statefor the Environment and for Scotland will also need to see re-presentatives of the local authority employers on the same basis. -These meetings would best take place when the TUC guidance hasbeen issued and before the Government issue the expected statement in July of the arrangements to apply after abolition of pay control.CONFIDENTIAL
