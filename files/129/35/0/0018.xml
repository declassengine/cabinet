J. N.-B.Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1,28th May, 1949.ANNEX AAide Memoire from the Government of the Irish Republic to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United kingdom. The Irish Government have considered the provisions of the IrelandBill&quot; which was presented to the British Parliament on the evening of3rd May, 1949, upon which date it was first published.2. It is noted that the preamble to the Bill states one of its purposes to be&quot; to declare and affirm the constitutional position and territorial integrity ofNorthern Ireland &quot; and that Section 1 of the Bill contains a provision declaring that &quot; Northern Ireland remains part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and of theUnited Kingdom&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and of the United kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.&quot;3- Immediately following upon its publication, Mr. MacBride conveyedverbally to the British Government the objections of the Irish Government andthe strong resentment which this measure would arouse.4. The Government of Ireland now wish again to register their emphaticand solemn protest against the re-enactment by the British Parliament of Legis-lation purporting to confirm the unjust partition of Ireland and to convey tothe British Government the deep resentment which this step has evoked amongthe Irish people at home and throughout the world.5.   The British Government cannot have been unaware of the feelings of deep concern and indignation with which these provisions would be viewed by.the Irish Government and people.   When press reports first suggested early in37083 ^        b
January that legislation of this nature might be introduced in the British Parlia-ment, the Irish Government stated their position in the matter in the clearestand most emphatic terms in the Aide Memoire of 7th January, 1949, to the BritishGovernment. That communication having stated the grave anxiety which theIrish Government felt at the suggestion pointed out how completely unjustifiablesuch action would be, and expressed the hope that &quot; nothing will be done&quot; byway of legislation or otherwise which could in any way be construed as pro-longing or strengthening the undemocratic anomaly whereby our country Jhasbeen partitioned against the will of the overwhelming majority of the irish people.&quot; No reply or comment in respect of this Aide M&amp;noire Was received bythe Irish Government notwithstanding the fact that in the meantime the urgent need for finding a solution of the problem of partition has frequently been urged by the Irish Government both in public statements, in informal communications with members of the British Government, as well as in the Irish Government^Aide Memoire of 8th February, 1949, on the subject of the Atlantic Pact.6. In the light of these circumstances and the British legislation wherebyIreland was partitioned being still on the British Statute Book, the Governmentof Ireland can only regard the enactment of the provisions referred to as an unnecessary provocation and gratuitous reassertion of the claim of the british parliament to intervene in Irish affairs.7. The British Government must already be familiar with the serious diffi-culties and grave dangers resulting from the enforced unjust and unnaturalpartition of Ireland. The step which the British Government is about to takemust inevitably increase enormously the existing difficulties and dangers bothinternally and from the point of view of the relations between Great Britain andIreland. For this consequence the British Government must assume full resppn-sibility.8. The taking of such a step at a time when friendly co-operation betweendemocratic nations is of such vital importance makes it even more difficult tounderstand the reasons which have prompted it. The importance of Anglo-Irishfriendship as an element of strength and cohesion in the democratic world has been frequently stated. For their part, the Irish Government have striven to&apos; remove the last obstacles which prevented the developing and strengthening ofsuch a friendship. It was their hope that the new concept of operation between states of the North Atlantic would, by affording the occasion for the friendlyexamination of the last remaining difficulty between the two countries, providea means for its solution. The views of the Irish Government on the matter were stated as follows in the two concluding paragraphs of their Aide Memoire of8th February referred to above, viz. : &quot; We feel, therefore, that the wisest andmost realistic approach to the question of North Atlantic security lies, so far asIreland is concerned, in ending a situation which threatens the peace of these islands and which may, at any moment, prove a source of grave embarrassment to both Britain and Ireland. Sooner or later, the question will have to.be solved.The Government of Ireland feels strongly that it is better to face the question in a realistic fashion and as a matter of urgency now, rather than to allow a situation to develop wherein a solution might be more difficult. The IrishGovernment is convinced that, far from rendering disservice to Britain, the bringing about of a solution of this question would strengthen Britain&apos;s defensiveposition and increase the security of the States of the Atlantic community. by offering their assistance and mediation, and by creating a situation wherein theproblem could be discussed, the participating nations would help to end anundemocratic and dangerous situation and in doing so would render an invaluableservice by strengthening the internal harmony and cohesion of the community of States in the North Atlantic.&quot; Instead of seeking to remove the sole.obstacle to Ireland&apos;s participation in the Atlantic Pact, the British Government now pro-pose to take a step marking a further disregard of Ireland&apos;s territorial integrity and a fresh denial of Ireland&apos;s right to national self determination. TheGovernment of Ireland deplores such a destructive and unfriendly attitude at atime when so much effort is being devoted to preserve fundamental rights andliberties and the democratic way of life. The fact that Ireland is a small nationdebarred by her exclusion from the United Nations Organisation from other means of redress makes it all the more necessary for the Government of ireland to reassert unequivocally the right of the Irish people to determine, democratic-ally, of their own free will, without outside interference, their own affairs.
9. But the Government of Ireland most strongly urges that, even at thislate hour, steps may be taken by the British Government on the lines indicatedin the Irish Government&apos;s Aide M&amp;noire of 8th February, 1949, concerning the atlantic Pact, the Irish Government would, however, press the view that if anysuch steps are to be taken they should be taken as a matter of urgency now, ratherthan to allow the development of a situation fraught with further difficulties and dangers.7 th May, 1949.ANNEX BAide Memoire from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom to the Government of the Irish RepublicHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have taken note of theviews of the Government of the Republic of Ireland set out in their Aide Memoireof 7th May regarding the Preamble and Clause 1 of the Ireland.Bill.In reply, they wish in the first place to emphasise that the declaration con-tained in the Ireland Bill with reference to Northern Ireland constitutes no new departure in policy. The Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 28th october last said : &quot; The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom hasalways been that no change should be made in the constitutional status of Northern-Ireland without Northern Ireland&apos;s, free agreement.&quot; On 25th November thePrime Minister made a statement recognising the close ties joining the irish republic and the United Kingdom, and the common desire of both countries thatclpse and friendly relations between them should continue; on the same occasion the Prime Minister repeated what he had said on 28th October about the positionof Northern Ireland.By an agreement signed on 3rd December, 1925, and later confirmed by legislation in both countries, the Governments of the United Kingdom and of theIrish Free State agreed to the present boundaries of Northern Ireland. The PrimeMinister&apos;s statements of 28th October and 25th November, and the declarationcontained in the Ireland Bill are designed to make it clear that except by dueconstitutional process Northern Ireland will not cease to be part of His Majesty&apos;sdominions and of the United Kingdom. It is not in doubt that a large majorityof the population of Northern Ireland at present desire that Northern ireland should remain within the United Kingdom. The Irish Republic has ceased tobe part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions, and recognition is given to that fact in the Ireland Bill. The United Kingdom Government are at a loss to understandhow they can legitimately be accused by the Government of the Irish republic of impairing in any way the co-operation between democratic nations by their proposal to declare, in the same Bill that Northern Ireland remains part of HisMajesty&apos;s dominions and of the United Kingdom, and that no change will bemade in her status unless the consent of the people of Northern Ireland,expressed through their Parliament, has first been obtained.It is open, as it always has been open, to the Government of the Irish Republicto provide evidence to the people of Northern Ireland that their interests lie with the people of the Irish Republic rather than with the rest of the UnitedKingdom. The United Kingdom Government will always be happy to see thedevelopment of good feeling between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Meanwhile, they are satisfied that no good would come were they to leave in doubt the right of Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom so long asthe majority of its people desire this.10th May, 1949.37083
. . , ANNEX C   &quot;   :Report from the United Kingdom Representative to the republic of IrelandDear Secretary of State, lQth May, 1949The Partition agitation has developed considerably in the last few days andI think you may care to have my own analysis of the position.2. Inevitably, Partition has always been a source of political grievance, andthere has been always a strong and real desire in Southern Irish hearts to see it ended. Rut I do not believe that, until the introduction of the Ireland Billin the House of Commons, there was any effectively active feeling in this countryabout it. Mr. de Valera had, during his sixteen years of office, registeredperiodical protests against it. Its use by the Costello Government as a reasonfor Eire&apos;s remaining outside the Atlantic Pact had carried little conviction inthe country. I am doubtful, despite the assertions of the Government spokesmento the contrary, whether there is even now any strong current of active feelingabout it. But the agitation which has been started consequent on the introductionof the Ireland Bill and which has been deliberately fomented by the anti-PartitionCommittee, on which Mr. Costello and Members of his Government andMr. de Valera all sit, is beginning to have a slight effect. And if it is kept upthe public may well come to believe that there is real justification for it, and theemotions of the younger, less stable, and more left wing elements may be workedon in a way that will lead to some incident, in itself of relatively small importance,but the consequences of which might be great.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have done their best to help the Irish Goverh-ment to keep things quiet if they so wished. The reply to the Irish Note of 7th May was conciliatory. The Debate on the introduction of the Ireland Bill, was restrained and friendly. But&apos; the response from the Irish Governmentalside was disappointing. Mr. Costello&apos;s speeches in the Dail (immediately afterreceipt of the reply to the Irish Note), and at the protest meeting on 13th May,were intemperate in tone, and designed to work up feeling through the country.They ignored the case on the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland side.On Doth occasions His Majesty&apos;s Government were subjected to much criticism,and while Mr. Costello&apos;s speeches have referred to the need for restraint, theyhave done so in terms calculated rather to familiarise their readers with the ideaof reprisals than to dissuade them from action. Mr. de Valera&apos;s utterances haveshown greater dignity and balance than those of the Taoiseach. Mr. MacBride,Mr. Norton and Mr. Dillon have been relatively moderate. In no case has therebeen any effort to deal with the case on merits. That is perhaps understandablesince all parties have their eye on the internal political battle and the nextelections. But great risks have been taken, and much damage done to thosegood relations between United Kingdom&apos;and Ireland which were so promising.4. As regards the tone of Mr. Costello&apos;s speeches, he had, I understand,a considerable practice at the Bar, and particularly in jury cases. I am told thathis technique in the speeches that he has made is completely reminiscent of hisbehaviour in court. His petulance, his refusal to see the arguments for the other side, his readiness to appeal to prejudice, his disposition to labour a weak point,his anxiety to play on the feelings of his audience, are all, it is said, part of hisnormal court manner. But, in court, when his duty to his client has been satisfied and the brief disposed of, that is the end of the business. If the explana-tion which I have just given is correct Mr. Costello fails to recognise the differencebetween the tactics and the phrases than can properly been adopted by an advocateanxious to move the feelings of a jury, and those appropriate to a Prime minister with a sense of responsibility handling before a public audience a great politicalissue. I feel no doubt that he and his colleagues realise the value to the irish republic of good relations with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. in personal discussion of political issues he is reasonable, fairminded, and ready totake a point in a friendly and understanding manner. It is the more to beregretted that on the platform his attitude should be so different.5. As I write the Government have aligned themselves on the Partition issuewith Mr. de Valera.   They have committed themselves to an uncompromising
-attitude; they have done much, by their speeches and their endeavour to raisefeeling in the Press and in the country, to spoil the good atmosphere that was developing between Ireland and the United Kingdom; if the agitation persistsafter the Bill -passes into law, they risk not only making the North still moreintractable, but stimulating incidents on the border, or against individuals in theSouth.6. To what is the attitude of the Irish Government and its apparent dis-regat-d of consequences to be attributed ?7. The short answer appears to be that the Government are not confident thaton any major political issue such as the repeal of the External Relations Act orPartition they can hold their own if Mr. de Valera starts a campaign. Theyhave, therefore, tried to protect themselves by taking the initiative. Over the external Relations Act thy did so at the cost of a breach of their election pledgesa breach which has been ill seen by a considerable number of their supporters,and which has tarnished Mr. Costello&apos;s reputation for political integrity. Fromtheir proposal to repeal the External Relations Act a, step which Mr. de Valerawhen in power had hot taken, and which from the Opposition benches he hadnot advocated-^these flowed immediately the Northern demand for a guarantee.But for the uncertainty as to the future resulting from the proposed repeal of :theAct, Jinked as it was in Dublin with declarations that the ending of Partition wasthe,next step, there could have been no justification for a Northern demand for aguarantee : and had it.been put forward it is difficult to believe that it could havebeen taken seriously.8. In the course of the debates on.the repeal of the External Relations act the Government committed themselves to Partitiomas the next step. The monthsthat followed were marked by the setting-up of the All-Party anti-Partition Com-mittee, and the collection of subscriptions designed to influence the elections inthe North. At a later stage the failure to end;Partition was put forwards as thepretext for Ireland&apos;s refusal to joint the Atlantic Pact. During these monthsmembers of the Government repeatedly expressed themselves as confident that theend of Partition was nearer than it had e.ver been.9. The Government had thus increasingly committed themselves on the issueof Partition. When the moment came for His Mai esty&apos;s Government to takelegislative notice of the guarantee promised to Northern Ireland by the PrimeMinister in October and November, 19.48, they had therefore no choice but to go atleast as far. as Mr. de Valera in their protests against the guarantee, and to asso-associate themselves with his attitude in the fullest and most emphatic manner,regardless of the consequences. Any endeavour to take a more reasonableline, to damp down public feeling and agitation, to deal with the issueon merits, or to weigh the considerations of which His Majesty&apos;s Government hadto take aceount, would at once expose them to the charge of being bad Irishmen,and worse patriots than the Opposition. The resultant. increase of prestige toMr. de Valera might well have disintegrated Mr. Costello&apos;s not too tightly-knitCoalition. The damage to its reputation in terms of the next election wouldhave been most grave. The Government&apos;s decision not to join the Atlantic Pacthad proved unpopular and hard to defend in a country so Catholic, and it was important for them to-urge that it was solely because of Partition. Finally, theneed to concentrate all energies on settling the Partition issue was and is a usefulanswer to critics of delays in the implementing of the Government^ social servicesprogramme, or its inability or failure to pursue other schemes of economic or social improvement. It was, I believe, in these circumstances that they took theline that they have taken.10. It remains to be seen whether they will even so be able to hold their ownagainst the leader of the Opposition. The All-Party anti-Partition Committee isreported to meet frequently. It may be assumed that whatever emerges from ithas Mr. de Valera&apos;s full approval and that he finds himself in effect in a positionto set the pace for the Government in the Committee. Mr. de Valera will gethis full share, and perhaps more than it, of the credit for any success thatthe anti-Partition campaign may produce. But if that campaign fails, or hasto be abandoned, the Government is likely to.get the discredit. In that event wemay hear more of the unwisdom of a policy which by repealing the external relations Act, in sharp contrast to Mr. de Valera&apos;s cautious retention of it, pre-cipitated the British guarantee to Ulster, and by leaving the Commonwealth
aggravated the difficulty of a friendly understanding with the North. There isalready being quoted in Dublin a remark attributed to a Northern Ministerabout the Costello Government &quot; First by repealing the Act they gave us theelection on a plate. Then they gave us the guarantee. What are they going togive us next? &quot;11. It is not surprising that in these circumstances the opinion is frequentlyexpressed that Mr. de Valera&apos;s long political experience and great astutenesshave enabled him without effort to manoeuvre the Government into a position inwhich in the hope of outbidding him they take the unpopular and embarrassingdecisions while he benefits by the false steps into which they have been led.12. It is difficult at this stage to judge how things will go. Government and opposition alike are committed to pressing the issue.13. I am sure that neither wants to see any resort to force, unwise as someof their speeches have been. Nor, on the best advice available, is there reason tothink that the extremer elements are yet either planning or equipped for foreignaction (the objectionable posters urging people to &quot;Arm to take the North,&quot; or&quot; Six Divisions, Six Months, Six Counties &quot; recently put up in Dublin are thework of the small Irish Fascist group and were at once removed by the Police).14. But without loss of credit they cannot let the agitation drop. They are committed by Mr. Costello&apos;s speeches and Mr. de Valera&apos;s support to doing all they can to injure His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; in their prestige and in their prideand in their pocket &quot; if Partition remains in being.   I would anticipate (a) continued lobbying for a round-table conference, preferably on theinitiative of another member of the Commonwealth;(&amp;) a campaign to mobilise Irish opinion in the United States and the Com-commonwealth countries by way of bringing pressure to bear on HisMajesty&apos;s Government.15. Action on these lines would at any rate satisfy public opinion in thiscountry that something was being done the man in the street is probably moreconvinced of the practical difficulties of a friendly and satisfactory settlementthan anyone is prepared to admit.16. But from our point of view it will be of the greatest importance, if a campaign such as I suggested in the United States and other commonwealth countries is likely to develop, that we should not let our case go by default. Thereare obvious objections to becoming entangled in a war of words. But Irishpropaganda will be insistent, it will not concern itself too closely with the factsor the merits, and it will have as its electioneering agents a vast number of Irishmen and women overseas, many of them traditionally hostile and suspicious ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government and reluctant to accept the good faith of the british people. I have no doubt thatxonsideration is already being given to this aspect ofthe matter. Material for use in dealing with such a campaign is under prepara-tion here, but if when it is received you wish it amplified in any way, the necessary arrangements will at once be made.Yours sincerely,(Signed) GILBERT LAITHWAITE.
