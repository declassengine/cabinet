THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT      1 9Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1949TOP secret copy No.31CP. (49) 13411th June, 1949.CABINETVISIT TO HONG KONG, 6th JUNE-9th JUNE, 1949Memorandum by the Minister of defence in view of the evident importance of possible developments in regard to hong Kong, as the Chinese Liberation Armies sweep southwards, I decided,with the Prime Ministers approval,&apos; to pay a quick visit to the Colony duringthe Whitsun recess in order to confer on the spot with the local civil and militaryauthorities and to inform myself by personal inspection about the circumstancesunder which its defence might have to be conducted in the event of armed attack.I left London on 2nd June and reached Hong Kong on the evening of 6th June.The return flight began on the evening of 9th June and I was back in the UnitedKingdom on 14th June. The three Commanders-in-Chief, Far East, Were in hong Kong during my visit. Some account of the journey itself and of other problems studied, at points en route is at Annex I, but in this report it is withHong Kong alone that I am concerned.2. The general background against which I had to study the problem ofthe defence of Hong Kong was provided by the Government&apos;s decision, which Iannounced in the House of Commons on 5th May, to send substantial reinforce-ments to the Colony and by the agreement in principle in the Cabinet on26th May (CM. (49) 38th Conclusions, Minute 3) to increase the size of thegarrison still further, but not to announce this decision pending consultation withthe other members of the Commonwealth and the United States. With such a strengthening of the garrison envisaged, and the expectation that the crisis mightbe reached in the late summer or early autumn, it was of particular importance for me to study the problem of the relations between the civil and militaryauthorities in the Colony.Instructions to the Governor3. At a meeting of Ministers the night before my departure from London(Gen. 294/1st Meeting), this problem, to which attention had been drawn by theGovernor himself in his signal No. 15 of 3rd May, was discussed. The problemhad been stated by the Governor in the following striking terms : &quot; Immigration control, registration of the population, compulsory mili-tary service and many of the elementary security measures which are in forcein most States to-day would, to all intents and purposes, kill our trade inorder to make the defence of its corpse more effective.&quot;Ministers appreciated this dilemma and accepted a proposal, agreed to by theChiefs of Staff, for its solution on the following lines : An overall commander of all three Services in. Hong Kong should be appointed; for the time being, atleast, the Civil Governors powers and functions should remain unimpaired, exceptthat he should be given instructions that, in the event of a clash of opinion between37157b
himself and the Commander, Hong Kong, as to the necessity for, &quot;or executionof, any security measures, the views of the latter should prevail. Formal instruc-tions to this effect, approved by the Prime Minister, reached me in Singapore,and on arrival in Hong Kong I made it my first business to acquaint the Governorwith the nature of the instructions of which I was the bearer.4. After dinner, on the evening of my arrival, I had! two hours&quot; private discussion with the Governor, Sir Alexander Grantham. He had received a warning telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies,-and I found &quot;himmost approachable and in general responsive and understanding. . I made itclear to Sir Alexander that we had a full appreciation of his experience and greatcapacity in Colonial administration and his special local knowledge of theproblems of Hong Kong, but that the possibilities arising from the rapid advanceof the Chinese Communist Forces made it imperative to ensure that any military or security measures could be taken without delays which would go far to render them ineffective, and might lead to disaster in circumstances which would gravelyaffect the whole of the position in South-East Asia. I indicated that it was felt that the cost in man-power and money of the additional reinforcements,which His Majesty&apos;s Government had approved in principle, would be the subjectof heavy criticism, and would indeed be unjustified if not supported in time byadequate security and intelligence provisions on the spot. It was difficult to reconcile in the minds of outside observers the complaints that the government statement of 5th May had proved to be inadequate in re-establishment of reason-able feelings of confidence in the Colony, with the hesitancy to adopt such measures as overall registration, improvement of intelligence as to existing cellsof Communist activity (and their potential expansion with continuing infiltration),and plans for comprehensive immigration control. In these circumstances HisMajesty&apos;s Government wished to obtain a machinery which, whilst retainingto the fullest possible extent the powers of the Governor and the advantage ofhis knowledge and experience, would prevent the ultimate defeat of militarydefensive measures by subversive activities known to have been so successfulelsewhere. In the plan set out in the instructions which I handed to him, theintention was to provide him with a Military Commander over all-military defence forces in the Colony, including local naval defence forces, of the required status and knowledge to obtain adequate discussion and agreed decisions to meet theproblems projected. For that purpose General Festing had been selected. I feltconfident that, with loyal co-operation from both sides, this could be made towork effectively. Having read the instructions the Governor at once indicated that he would be quite willing to do his very best to make the plan work, but pointed out that, if he were to do so, it would in his judgment be essential that,if on any matter which he considered to be of great importance to the welfare of the Colony there was disagreement, he should have a right of appeal to theSecretary of State for the Colonies. I said that obviously there could be no intention of preventing his normal free access to the Secretary of State, providedthat there was no delay in matters of urgent military necessity. There was alsothe question of the possibility of reference to the British Defence Co-co-ordination committee. Our discussion then ranged over a wide area in complete frankness,and I found the Governor&apos;s attitude to be generally most helpful. He asked tosleep on the question of appeal, and indicated that it was the one point in thewhole matter which might otherwise produce a situation in which he wouldhave no alternative but to resign. When he met me again at 9 a.m. on 7th June,Sir Alexander repeated that he was anxious to co-operate but submitted a formof words to be inserted in the instructions to safeguard his right of appeal tothe Secretary of State for the Colonies.He readily agreed to adjust the wording to meet points which I raised. i therefore wired at once to the Prime Minister for authority to accept this additionto the instructions. When I informed the Commanders-in-Chief of the action Ihad taken I found they fully agreed.5. The Prime Minister replied favourably to my signal subject only toadding a requirement that the Governor should inform the British Defence Co-ordination Committee in any case in which he exercised his right of appeal. Iwas thus in a position on the morning of my departure, 9th June, to transmitformally to the Governor, on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the instructions reproduced at Annex II.
Registration of the Population6. As indicated in the Governors signal No. 15 already referred to, regis-tration of the population was one of the obvious military security steps about which he was apprehensive in relation to the peculiar circumstances of Hong-Kong. Once on the spot I was able to appreciate much better the kind of pressures,and conflicting influences, to which the local authorities are subject. That thereis much local anxiety about, security was evident at the press conference whichI held, and from many enquiries made to me by prominent citizens. We haddirect evidence of the pull the other way in Nanking telegram No. 789 of 7th June;;together with the Shanghai telegrams to which it relates, in which it appeared that the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, holding the view that HongKong could be rendered untenable by means of a boycott and. internal unrest, repre-sented that the sending of reinforcements to the Colony had been given undesirablepublicity of a defiant and provocative nature. This was a good example of pressure from commercial interests, not in Hong Kong alone but on the ChinaCoast generally, which the Governor of the Colony cannot ignore.7. I had, however, had the advantage on the journey from Singapore to hong Kong of being able to read Sir Henry Gurney&apos;s despatch No. 5 of 30th May,setting out the experience gained in operations in Malaya, for the guidance ofother Colonial Governments. An extract from this despatch on the subject of registration is at Annex III. What Sir Henry Gurney had to say strengthenedme in the view that an improvement in internal security in Hong Kong would only be obtained by introducing registration at once as a preliminary step toinstituting, at whatever date proved to be necessary, a comprehensive controlof immigration. Such control could-only be introduced when registration hadbeen completed, or at least well advanced. The Governor was prepared to go-ahead with registration, but warned me that not more than 250,000 cases couldbe dealt with in a month, and that it would therefore require five months to break the back of the problem by registering 1,250,000; it would be eight months&quot;beforethe whole of Hong Kong&apos;s 2 million people could be registered. In this contextI had a discussion with the Commissioner of Police, who considered that it wouldbe virtually impossible to improve on this estimate of time since registration mustinvolve photographing and thumb printing every individual. American apparatusis required, which I think might have been ordered earlier, but the Governorpromised to see this was ordered at once. I still think steps should be taken to speed up the tempo of registration and I pressed this on the Governor just before leaving.Trading Position of the Colony8. Hong Kong lives by its trade, and the question how far it can standa siege is a subject of intense local interest. On the statistics available to me itwould seem that in 1948 almost four-fifths of Hong Kong&apos;s trade, both imports and exports, was with countries other than China. The problem is. therefore,,how far this entrepot business could be maintained if faced with an activelyhostile mainland and a boycott. In discussion with the Governor, I found that-it would not be satisfactory to accept the published trade statistics as a basis,for a final judgment on this issue. There is a large tonnage of unrecorded trade:and merchandise of all kinds which comes across the land frontier which neverappears in trade returns. A large part of this tonnage is food, and its cessationdue to blockade would be a serious matter. I saw for myself the kind of thing that goes on when inspecting the frontier area. On a peak in Chinese territorywe saw a lookout and below him a number of cattle and some, to all appearances,inoffensive peasants. On our side of the boundary armed members of the HongKong Police Force had them covered with rifles. The arrival of myself, theG.O.C.-in-C. and the G.O.C. in jeeps was obviously an unexpected factor in thesituation, but it was explained to me that the men on the Chinese side were onlywaiting their opportunity to smuggle the cattle over the border under cover ofdarkness. There would be little chance of preventing this. Further along thefrontier we came to the village which has grown up on both sides of the boundarystone and the frontier police demonstrated to me the immense difficulties thatwould attend any attempt to impose strict control at this point.9. But, quite apart from the question of frontier control, it is evident thatthe attitude of many of the commercial interests in Hong Kong will continueto be one of the most intractable factors in planning its defence.   The business
people want the best of both worlds. They want adequate defence providedfor their interests and persons, but nothing said about it, and to go on makingmoney, indifferent to the questions of principle which arise. Yet, while the shanghai Chamber of Commerce was complaining of publicity about reinforce-ments, I am informed that during my visit to Hong Kong the cross rate ofexchange in Canton for the Hong Kong dollar against the pound sterling improved by 1-50 dollars to 14 - 30. .1 was assured that my visit to Hong Kong was theprincipal element in this improvement. Yet no successful defence of Hong Kongcan be conducted which does not have regard to the dominating position of the trading interests in the Colony. The Governor is very willing to examine ways and means of expanding Hong Kong&apos;s trade with countries other than China,and I believe that this is one of the most important things that the civil authorities:Can do to help prepare Hong Kong to meet the Communist challenge. TheGovernor will, however, require further expert advice for this purpose and Ishould like to see suitable appointments to his staff made as quickly as possible.The Executive Council and the Local Defence Committee10. During my visit the Governor arranged for me to meet both these bodies.My meeting with the Executive Council on 7th June was most satisfactory. 1made them a short speech reminding them of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which I had announced in the House on 5th May and of the factthat the reinforcements we were sending provided solid evidence of our firmnessand determination. I was careful to avoid even hinting at the possibility of reinforcements additional to those already announced. There seemed to be nodisposition on the part of the members of the Council to adopt an attitude criticalcf His Majesty&apos;s Government apart from one of the Chinese members. I hada discussion with the Local Defence Committee on the following day which was attended by the Commanders-in-Chief.The Military Situation11. I held discussions with the Military Commanders on the spot, and eachCommander outlined to me the role which he envisaged his forces would play inthe defence of the Colony. The Army Commander made it clear that at thepresent time, with existing forces available (three battalions), the whole force would have to be deployed forward in the New Territories in defence of thefrontier, leaving only the Hong Kong Defence Force and certain administrative and specialist troops to look after the internal security of the Cities and Port.As the Hong Kong Defence Force is at present virtually non-effective the G.O.C.has decided to make use of the first reinforcements to arrive (The LeicestershireRegiment) to ensure the security of the base. /12. On the arrival of the 27th Brigade in July, there will be available for defence of the frontier one full brigade plus supporting artillery, leaving a brigadeavailable for internal security in the cities and as a reserve for counter-attack.When in September the garrison is increased to a Division plus a Brigade by the arrival of the 28th Infantry Brigade from the United Kingdom and the royal marine Commando Brigade from Malta, the G.O.C. intends to deploy two brigades forward for the defence of the frontier, with one in reserve. This force will be supported by artillery and tanks. This will leave one Brigade availablefor ensuring internal security in the cities and for beach defence, exclusive ofthe Guards Brigade in Malaya, earmarked for reinforcing Hong Kong if required.13.   As regards the Royal Navy, the main tasks envisaged are (a) To support the Army by bombardment and by bringing supplies if required;(b) to prevent an influx of refugees by sea.At the present time (b) above is the responsibility of the Water Police, andthe Navy are making arrangements for additional craft manned by naval personnel to be available. If the situation becomes serious, the Royal Navyintends taking over responsibility for the operation of all Coastal Patrol craft.14. The present R.A.F. strength in the Colony consists of the Flying-BoatSquadron for sea reconnaissance in co-operation with the Navy, and a SpitfireSquadron of nine aircraft, which is due to be increased to sixteen by the end
of the month. A second Spitfire Squadron is due to arrive during the third week in July. This will bring the total Fighter Force up to thirty-two Spitfires, whichwill be capable of operating either in the Air Defence or ground attack role.Early warning and fighter control radar have now been installed,: and the AirCommander expressed himself satisfied with the adequacy of these, though he pointed out that they would hot provide protection against low flying attack. he considered that the ultimate force should consist of three squadrons-the thirdsquadron to be a long-range fighter squadron. In emergency the fighter strengthcpuld be increased still further by flying in an additional Spitfire Squadron from malaya. &apos; &apos; /15. At present the only landing strip available at Hong Kong is Kar Takairfield. This airfield is very congested as it is used by all civil companies as well asby the R.A.F. In bad weather no diversion airfield is available and it has there-fore been decided to construct an emergency strip in the New Territory to theNorth-East of Kowloon which will be available for the Fighter Squadrons inthe event of bad weather at Kai Tak, and which appeared to me to be themost suitable site available. The pierced steel planking for making this stripis being shipped from Singapore.16. On the general question of reserve supplies for all three Services, I was assured that stocks of ammunition and food are now being built up to the necessarylevel. It was not clear that oil fuel and aviation fuel supplies were fully adequate for Naval and R.A.F. requirements and I asked for the position to be speciallyexamined from this aspect. The three Service Commanders expressed them-selyes as satisfied in all other respects with the arrangements now in hand for reinforcing the Colony and are confident that, when the final build-up has been achieved, our forces will be adequate to meet any threat from Communist China.Local Enlistment17. I had the advantage of a discussion with Colonel Ride, the CommandingjOfficer for the Hong Kong Defence Force, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of theUniversity. He confirmed the view held by many, that not enough had yet been said to establish local confidence, but seemed more satisfied as a result of our talk.Instead of meeting a small number of his recruits as he suggested, I persuadedhim to summon at 30 hours&apos; notice as many as possible of the Volunteers, and onWednesday, 8th June, I addressed over 500 of them at the local Headquarters,thanking them for their public spirit in coming forward to help and urging eachone to be a missionary to obtain recruits both for the Defence Force and the manning of essential services in any emergency. Colonel Ride informed me after-wards that he was delighted with the turn-out at such short notice, and especially with the favourable impression created. I shook hands with the majority ofthose who paraded, including considerable numbers of Chinese, and had manyindividual conversations with them. I was informed that the total number of volunteers, including those for essential services, now exceeded 2,000 and I amhopeful that, if there is a successful follow-up, satisfactory numbers will beenrolled.The Police Force and Internal Security18. My talks in the Colony included a discussion with Mr. D. W. Mackintosh,the Commissioner of Police, who was one of the party with whom I toured theNew Territories, and with the Superintendent of his Special Branch, Mr. Wilson.I formed the impression that Mr. Mackintosh&apos;s organisation was both efficient and reliable so far as regards normal police work in the detection and preventionof crime. This impression was confirmed by some of those in the Colonies bestable to judge, including the Chief Justice. Much, however, remains to be done to achieve a similar standard of efficiency in relation to political crime and sub-versive activity. The Commissioner was confident that he could at any givenmoment clamp down if the internal situation became difficult, though it seemedto me that this view was over-optimistic without the prior introduction of asystem of registration, which alone could cope with any large influx of population.19, The Governor has full confidence in the Commissioner, but is preparedto agree that there may be a case for considering sending out to the Colony an expert in Special Branch work who could advise on the improvement of theorganisation.37157 b 3
20. The Officer strength of the police force in British Officers is deficient,of 14 out of an establishment of 41.&quot; I understand that steps are in train to post additional Officers.  It is important that they should be sent out quickly.Development of Counter Propaganda21. It seemed to me from reading the local press and from the press con-ference that much more could be done by judicious counter propaganda, for thepopulation is no doubt subject to the influence of heavy Communist propaganda,both by press and radio. Our own broadcasting service might be re-examined.I was impressed by what I heard from the United States broadcasting service,which persistently puts the United States over, while as I listened, for example, in ceylon to a British Overseas Service broadcast it summarised newspaper editorialsin, no doubt, an impartial manner, but thereby leaving the impression, e:g., inrelation to our own dock strike and railway dispute, that nationalisation had failed and that the Government could do nothing about it. It seems of theutmost importance that the freedom and comparative prosperity of Chinese in hong Kong should be constantly placed in contrast with the daily lessening of freedom under a police State in China and the lower standard of life there.Public Relations22. This must largely be a matter for the Governor, who undoubtedly hasa most difficult task in view of all the conflicting interests contained in the mixed &apos;population and its activities. From his experience the present Public RelationsOfficer ought to be able to meet the position. He was attached for &quot; special duties &apos;&apos; during the late war to the Staff at Chungking and in a private conversa-tion with him (which unfortunately was too late for me to have a further discussion with the Governor) I learned that he considers it impossible for hissmall staff to do really effective work in the conditions under which they workand also that stringent economy had prevented the adoption of a project for a50,000 edition of a news-sheet, which, however, starting with 500, has risen to something over a thousand; copies of this news-sheet are posted at public open-air stations and fairly largely read. I rather gathered from the Governor,however, that the present Public Relations Officer would not &quot; set the Thameson fire.&quot; . &apos; jvS:;Personal Impressions and Conclusions [\t.,23.   I left the Colony firmly convinced of the importance of adhering to thedecisions already taken to send further reinforcements to Hong Kong.   I held that view before my visit because of the significance which it seemed to me HongKong would possess in demonstrating our will to resist aggression and in, let us hope, arresting the onward rush of communism in South-East Asia.   after examining the terrain itself I believe a military defence of Hong Kong can be successfully made, though I do not by any means minimise the difficulties.   Thehigh mountains on the Chinese side of the New Territories, which dominate thefrontier itself, undoubtedly impose handicaps on the defenders, but these are morethan offset by the difficulties which would confront a Communist Chinese armyagainst prepared positions and guns sited, trained and ranged. The circumstances in 1949 are wholly different from those of 1941, the memory of which still livesin Hong Kong.   There is no doubt to-day of our control of the sea; we shallhave an integrated scheme of land defence including air support on an adequate&quot;scale; and we shall have fighter defences backed by an early warning system which, even taking into account the limited depth and size of the territory, shouldbe able to deal effectively with such air attack as it is likely to meet.  I considerthat under these conditions the defence can succeed against the probable scale of attack.   So far as I have doubts they concern such things as water, food and fuel.   With regard to the last of these I specifically asked while in the Colonythat aviation fuel reserves should be checked to allow for the increased navy and Air Force reinforcements.   This is being looked into.   On transport andammunition reserves, the position is satisfactory.  The water provision is reason-ably satisfactory unless the population continues rapidly to increase.  Alternativesupplies, such as from condensation, should be considered.24. My broad conclusion is that we have justification for sober confidence in our ability to hold Hong Kong as long as our hands are free elsewhere andwe send the further reinforcements which have been earmarked for the Colony
ANNEX INote on Other Matters Discussed at Various Points en route during theMinister of Defence&apos;s Journey to Hong KongDay 12nd June Flight from Northolt to Fayid.Day 23rd June Flight from Fayid, via Aden, to Negombo, Ceylon.  &apos;Day 34th June in Ceylon.The Prime Minister of Ceylon, the Hon. D. S. Senanayake, together withthe Parliamentary and Permanent Secretary of the Ceylon Ministry ofDefence and External Affairs, had a conference with the Minister atNegombo. From this it appeared that virtual stalemate had been reached inthe defence discussions with Ceylon and later that day a formal letter fromthe Ceylon Government gave confirmation of the position..

V. A.17th June, 1949.
Days 6-87th-9th June In Hong Kong.Day 910th June Back in Singapore.The Minister discussed with the Governor the problem of Service labour relations in Singapore. There is apparently serious danger of a strikeunless adequate machinery for negotiation of grievances can be established.The Minister undertook to discuss this problem as a matter of urgency withhis colleagues and with the Secretary of State for the Colonies on his returnto London.Day 1011th June At Negombo.   Delayed by engine trouble.Day 1112th June Flight from Negombo, via Riyan and Aden to Fayid.Day 1213th June The Minister paid a visit to the British Forces at Aqaba.Later he inspected typical married quarters in the Canal Zone and wasgiven an impression of the conditions under which many married officers and.other ranks in the Canal Zone are living.The Minister subsequently had a general discussion with the Com-manders-in-Chief of the problems facing the Middle East Command.Day 1314th June Flight from Fayid, via Malta, to Northolt.ANNEX IIInstructions to the Governor of Hong Kong(Conveyed by the Minister of Defence on behalf of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies)Having regard to the threat to the security of Hong Kong, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to appoint a Commander to command all the Land,Air and Local Naval defence forces in Hong Kong. He will be responsible tothe British Defence Co-ordination Committee through the Commanders-in-Chief,Far East.2. In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under considera-tion the recommendations in your secret signal No. 15 of 3rd May, 1949, thatin present circumstances the Hong Kong Government should continue to take all possible measures of defence and security, provided they do not jeopardise the primary function of the Colony as a trading base.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully recognise that it is most important in.the interests of the welfare of the population of the Colony and of internal security that&apos; the commercial life of Hong Kong should be maintained to thefullest extent compatible with the developing situation. Nevertheless, havingregard to the threat to the security of the Colony from external aggression and/orinternal unrest His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that, in the event of any differences in opinion as to the necessity for, or execution of, any security measures, the views of the Commander, Hong Kong, should prevail providedthat, except in cases of extreme urgency, if the difference of opinion concerns amatter of great importance to the welfare of the Colony you shall have theright to refer the matter to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and shall be guided by his decision. In the event of your appealing to the Secretary of Stateyou should immediately inform the British Defence Co-ordination Committee.4. A copy of these instructions has been communicated to the Commanderdesignate.9th June, 1949.
ANNEX IIIExtract from Despatch No. 5 dated 30th May from Sir Henry Gurney,High Commissioner for the Federation of MalayaRegistrationThe natural complement to efficient information coverage is registration ofthe population. It is a comparatively simple matter for a political malcontentto disappear underground and to continue to work and to exert influence from ahidden base or bases when people go about their business with no ready meansof identification and move from place to place at will. But it is not so easy, infact it is difficult to remain out of sight of the police if a comprehensive and efficient system of national registration exists.The Communists in Malaya have shown a particular dislike for national registration. This was started here last July and finished in eight months. Thesystem provides every adult with an identity card bearing his photograph, and each card is issued against a thumb-print record. Photographers&apos; charges hadto be controlled and photographers became targets for the bandits. Registrationis not only of great help to the police in dealing with immigration and move-ments of individuals, but it can also, if properly put across, be made to give anadded sense of security to those who have nothing to fear from the police.Registration is made more effective if it is linked with the various contactsan individual may have with the authorities, e.g., he should be required to pro-duce his identity card when applying for trade licences, vehicle licences, passports,ration cards, &amp;c.An adequate staff is necessary and sufficient supplies of photographic-material.If registration of employment .can be included, so much the better.
