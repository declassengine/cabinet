SECRET Copy No.. 31C.P.0i9) 11.82UTH MAY.  19k9CABINETDEFENCE OP HONG Kong memorandum by the Minister of defence. The Prime Minister has circulated to the Cabinet amemorandum (C.P.(ij-9) 119) on the political considerations involved in meeting the threat to the security of Hong Kong andon the possibility of seeking moral and material support in itsdefence from other countries of the Commonwealth and the UnitedStates. The present paper deals with the military implications of the defence of Hong Kong against a large-scale attack byChinese Communist forces.2. Hong Kong may well become the stage for a trial of strength between Communism and the Western Powers.    If theChinese Communist Government are able to force our withdrawal from the Colony, not only would the blow to our prestigethroughout the world be irreparable, but the immediate reper-cussions in South-East Asia would add immeasurably to our defence burdens in that area.3. On 5th May (c.M.Ci+9) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 2) theCabinet approved the proposals in C.P.(^9) 100 for the despatch to Hong Kong of reinforcements which are calculated to enablethe garrison to secure the Colony against all threats other than an organised attack by Chinese Communist forces.    These threatsinclude: -(a) internal unrest, probably sponsored by Communist-inspired trade unions;(b) a large-scale influx of refugees in numbers beyondthe capacity of the Colony to absorb;(c) sporadic attacks by Chinese guerrillas.I).. When these reinforcements hove arrived - the lastbattalion is due on 19th July - Hong Kong will have a- numericalstrength of army;        2 Infantry brigades (k British, 2 Gurkha battalions)2k Anti-tank guns (6-pounders)36 Field guns (25-pounders)16 Heavy A*A* guns (3.7 inch)12 Light A*A. guns (Bofors)16 Tankstogether with ancillary units.Before they can be considered fully operational,recent reinforcements will require a period oftraining.28

Air Force:       1 Spitfire Squadron (16 aircraft)1 Flying Boat Squadron (5 Sunderlands)Fighter control and early warning radar,Navy: 3 Cruisers&quot;(Tor whole 6 DestroyersFar East 3 FrigatesStation) Local patrol craft.5* It was made clear in the report by the Chiefs ofStaff which the Cabinet considered at their meetingon 3th May that the above forces would not be enough to meet alarge-scale Chinese Communist attack should this materialise.Since the nature of the terrain is not an obstacle to infantry,and infiltration by junk and sampan is likely, it is notpossible from the information available to give any realisticnumerical estimate of the strength that the Chinese Communistsmay concentrate against Hong Kong.    It is, however, estimatedthat not more than about 40,000 Chinese Communist troops could be deployed at any one time in a land offensive-    Theymight be supported by an initial air effort of some 30-60aircraft (fighters and bombers).   The Chiefs of staff considerthat we must be ready by early September if we are to deal witha threat on this scale,  should it develop .6. The Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that if we make it abundantly clear, by the despatch of certain additionalreinforcements and by a suitable public announcement, that we intend to defend Hong Kong against aggression,  our defences maynever be put to the test;    and that if they were, they woul d be capable of holding the Colony provided adequate measures are taken by the Civil Government to deal with the threat to internal security.    The Chiefs of Staff therefore propose that authority should now be given to send to Hong Kong the following further reinforcements?-Army,: 28th Infantry Brigade (ex United Kingdom)Royal Marine Coiumando Brigade (ex Malta - tobe placed under Army command by theAdmiralty)together with supporting units.Air Force:       1 Fighter Squadron (16 Spitfires)1 Long range fighter Squadron (l6 Hornets).Navy; 1 Light fleet carrier4 Destroyers or frigates1 Replenishment aircraft-carrier1 Hospital ship.In addition it is proposed that a further infantry brigadeshould be earmarked for despatch if the threat to Hong Kongseriously develops.   For this purpose,  the Guards Brigade in malaya is conveniently placed and by September could probablybe spared,  if necessary, without undue effect on the banditcampaign.7. If a decision is taken this week, the abovereinforcements could all arrive in Hong Kong by early September,with tire exception of the Aircraft Replenishment Carrier, whichcould not be there until a month later.    The two fighter squadrons could,  in fact, arrive within 6 weeks of the decisionbeing- taken, provided their base maintenance and headquarterspersonnel could be flown out in aircraft diverted from the berlin airlift.

8. The arrival of reinforcements on the above scalewould bring the garrison of Hong Kong up to the followingstrength! -Army; 4 Brigades (9 battalions, 3 commandos)48 Anti-tank guns (12 17-pounders, 36 6-pounders)5k Field guns (25-pounders)16 gun Medium Artillery (5.5 inch)24 Heavy A.A. guns (3*7 inch)36 Light A.A. guns (Bofors)58 Tanks (52 Comets, 6 Light Tanks)together with ancillary units.From September the 2nd Guards Brigade to be earmarked to move from Malaya to reinforceHong Kong in emergency.Air Force:        .  2 Fighter Squadrons (32 Spitfires)1 Long range Fighter Squadron (16 Hornets)1 Flying boat Squadron (5 Sunderlands)Fighter control and early warning radar.Navy; 3 Cruisers(for whole 15 Destroyers (or frigates)For East 1 LiSi:1&quot;b fleet carrierStation) 1 Replenishment carrier (in October)1 Hospital ship24 Local patrol craft for Hong Kong.9. The despatch of these further reinforcements will,however, have serious implications elsewhere, of which theprincipal are as follows;-(a) The effect on Western Union of the despatch offurther relatively large British forces to theFar East may be very considerable.(b) It will be necessary to call up Section &quot;A&quot; of theArmy Reserve (2,220 strong).    (This was done forthe Shanghai crisis in 1926).(c) There will be no effective strategic reserve in theUnited Kingdom until another infantry brigade canbe fully formed and equipped.It will take some threw months to do this, duringwhich there will be nothing more than an oddbattalion to meet erne rgency calls for land forces.(d) It will be necessary to relieve the battalion of theCommando Brigade now at Aqaba by an infantry battalion from the Middle East.The Commando Brigade itself forms part of the forces available to come to the assistance of Transjordanif our Treaty is invoked.(e) The present army medical resources can provide theminimum peacetime medical cover for the strengthof troops that will be in Hong Kong.    If it has toprovide even a &quot;scaled down;i medical cover to dealwith operations it will entail the withdrawal of specialised personnel now employed in hospitals inthe United Kingdom;  ^this will involve closing downsome 2,000 out of 5,500 hospital beds, thereby throwing

If it has toprovide even a &quot;scaled down;i medical cover to dealwith operations it will entail the withdrawal of specialised personnel now employed in hospitals inthe United Kingdom:    this will involve closing downsome 2,000 out of 5,500 hospital beds, thereby throwing

an additional burden on the National health service.    Otherwise the medical resourcesnecessary will have to come from Section tfB&quot; ofthe Army Reserve or from outside those at present available to the army.    The possibility of approaching the other Commonwealth countries for assistance in this should be examined.(f) Our air forces in Germany will be reduced by &quot;!1 Fighter Squadron unless replacement is madeby a Squadron from the United Kingdom,  or,possibly,  by an American Squadron.(g) The despatch of lb Hornet aircraft to Hong Kongwill reduce the effective long range fighterforce in the United Kingdom by 50 per cent.An alternative,  if the Australians were agreeable,would be to move to Hong Kong lb of the 2l\. first-line R.A.A.F. Mustangs now in South Japan.There is certain to be some delay in getting an australian reaction to this proposal and itwould therefore seem prudent to make preparations to send the Hornets.(h)      The airlift required to move essential personnel and equipment for the Spitfire Squadrons fromGermany and. the Hornet Squadron from this country would entail the withdrawal from the Berlin-airlift of two Dakota Squadrons.(d)      There will be no operational British aircraft-carrier in the Mediterranean during August and september.(k)     The provision of the necessary shipping presents amost difficult problem.    Ways and means ofsolving it are under urgent examination.10. Until the Cabinet have given their approval to thedespatch of further reinforcements to Hong Kong on the scalenow proposed, an approach cannot be made to the shipping linosor to the other Commonwealth countries with a view to theirlending us further emigrant ships;    nor can ether essentialpreparations be begun for the despatch of the troops, aircraft and naval forces.11. The above proposals represent the maximum effort which the United Kingdom can reasonably make to secure thedefence of Hong- Kong.    Other members of the Commonwealth arc-also vitally concerned in arresting the spread of Communismsouth-eastwards in Asia.   Australia, New Zealand, India and pakistan may be prepared to lend us assistance - moral andmaterial - in making Hong Kong secure.    The way in whichthese countries could be of assistance in providing armed forces both now and if the emergency develops is under urgent consideration by the Chiefs of staff.RFC OMMENDATIONS12. The Cabinet are asked: -(a)      to authorise the early despatch to Hong Kongof the reinforcements outlined in paragraph above:

(b) to take note of the implications of sending thesoreinforcements as indicated in paragraph 9 above;in particular(i) the possible effect an Western Union ofthe despatch of relatively large forcotto the Par Eastj(ii) the need to call up Section &quot;A&quot; of theArmy Reserve;    and(iii)  the absence for a period of threemonths of any effective strategic reserve in the United Kingdom.(c) to ensure that immediate steps are taken to gain the moral support of the other countries of the Commonwealth so that at the appropriate moment we can ask them to give us such materialaid as they,  on the one hand, may be able toprovide, and we,  on the other hand, require.A.V.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.,20th May, 1949.
