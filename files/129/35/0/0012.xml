[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS HRITAK2JIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETG. P. (49)  1225-1 ST 1949COPY NO.3(CABINETEFFECT OP NEW SICKNESS AND INJURYBENEFITS UPON ABSENTEEISM IN COAL MINESMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power-Despite the conclusion in the Minister of Labour&apos;smemorandum   CP. (49) 85 that there appears in fact to havebeen no appreciable increase in time lost as a result of increased sick benefit introduced last July, I am stillgravely concerned with the marked increase in involuntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry.2. For many years past a great amount of regularinformation has been collected on the subject of absenteeismin the industry.     The statistics show, for each week of theyear, both the number of shifts worked and the number lost through absence (excluding holidays, disputes, transport difficulties, etc.), the latter being split up between those forwhich a reasonable explanation is given,  such as sickness orinjury (called involuntary absenteeism), and those for which no satisfactory explanation is offered (voluntary absenteeism).The figures for the last eighteen months are asfollows:-Percentage of shifts lost throv^h^j^qgnteeiamran./Peb.1948ur./Apl.1948flay/June-1948[uly/Aug.1948. .t./0ct.1 948[:&apos;ov./Dec.1 948fan./Feb.1949ir./Apl.1949Involuntary AbsenteeismJarne monthsj1949   &quot;      year5.4 8.21948      ____and   in previous   Change5. 25. 05. 56.46. 07.07.46.95. 1-5. 25. 54. 8j.45. 22. 81. 70. 20. 20. 91. 21. 62. 2-1-Voluntary Absenteeism1948   Same months and in previous Change19^9 year6. 05.85.46. 86.15. 15.65.68. 98.54. 65.75. 26. 05. 8- 2.9- 1.7+ 0.84- 1.0-i- 0.9- 0. 1- 0. 8- 0. 2

3* There are, of course, seasonal variations inabsenteeism rates, and the&apos;change in the number of possibleshifts per week brought about first by the introduction of thefive-day week in May, 1947,, and secondly by the-extended hourso.t working in November,  194/, also affect some of the figures.Nevertheless their trend is perfectly clear.     While voluntaryabsenteeism has shown, very little change in the last eighteen&apos;months,  involuntary absenteeism - i. e.  absence through sicknessor injury - has shown a sharp increase since July, 192+8, andin March and April of this year was over 2+0 per cent higherthan in March and April of 192+8.      That the latter figure isnot explained by the influenza epidemic in the early monthsof this year is shown by the figures for the first two weeks of May, when involuntary absenteeism was still 2 per cent higher than in the comparable weeks of 192+8.k- The same development is revealed by the figures forthe average number of miners away from work for the whole ofa week through sickness or injury.During the eight weeks ended 12+th May last, theaverage number absent was 2+9,600]   whereas a year earlier thefigure for the same eight weeks was only 32,500.      The increasein these twelve months is over 50 per cent.5. While a further statistical study is being made bythe National Coal Board with special reference to the workingof the Industrial Injuries Act, I submit that the figures given above suggest pretty definitely that the changes made-last July have had a most serious effect on attendance in the coalmining industry.      The increase of about 2 per cent in therate of involuntary absenteeism means that we are losinp; &quot;coalat the rate of about A+ million tons a year, while the numberof shifts actually lost is sufficient to cancel out the resultof two years&apos; efforts to Increase the man-power of the industry by extra recruitment.6. While further-inquiry is no doubt necessary before any proposals can be formulated for remedying the situation,I venture to put forward certain preliminary conclusions whichI have reached as? a result of talks in various coalfields withminers and their leaders and representatives of management at different levels:-(a) It is becoming generally recognised in the coal-fields that attendance has become worse, as a result.lt of what is usually described vaguely.as &quot;the Health Service&quot;.     after discussion it became clear that by this is meant -(i)    the corning into force of the industrial injuries Act;(ii)    higher sick benefits;    and(iii)    the National Health Service.But by far the most important, of these in mining is thought tobe the first.      The National Health Service is in itself onlyindirectly of significance.(b) Benefits payable to miners under the industrial injuries Act together with the operation of P. A. Y. E.   and theFive &quot;Bay Week Agreement are discouraging a return to work,tinder the old Workmen&apos;s Compensation system, the maximum corn-pen nation payable to a married man with children who wasinjured was i4.5s.Od per week for the first thirteen weeks ana5os.Od thereafter, the total amount paid being limited toJths of the difference-between the man&apos;s earnings before ana

after the accident.      The effect of the Industrial InjuriesAct of 19*4-6 and the Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Schemetaken together has been to increase the compensation payable to a married man with children to 88s. 6d per week for thefirst twenty-six weeks and 109s.6d thereafter.Under the new scheme, payment for the three days&apos;waiting period is made if the man is unfitted to return on the twelfth day, whereas it was not paid under the old schemeunless incapacity lasted four weeks;   moreover under P. A. Y. E.a worker receives a refund of income tax in respect of anyweek in which he is absent, while under the Five Day WeekAgreement an injured worker is entitled to a bonus paymentpro rata to the shifts worked in the week.      The position was put very pungently by a miners&apos; leader speaking in my presencea few days ago to a Delegate Conference in his area.      &quot;it takes&quot;, he said, &quot;the hell of a good doctor to cure a minorinjury when a man is getting over  6 a week while he is away from the pit. &quot;(c)    Increased benefits would perhaps not have had suchserious consequences if at the same time it had been possibleto tighten up t?ie granting of certificates for injury&apos;and sickness.      But, at least as regards-the former, the oppositeseems to be the case.      Previously, as compensation was payable by the employer, he was given the right to have the claimantmedically examined,  and in the coal industry this was generallydone by doctors employed by the.industry itself.      The employerno longer has the right of medical examination.      Although liehas to furnish a certificate that an accident has occurred,the extent to which an accident is followed by absence from work is settled by the doctor&apos;s assessment of the injuryreceived.      Compensation is paid by the State on the strengthof a medical certificate given by the men!s own panel doctors.The latter have no responsibility to the coal industry;    theyhave a financial interest in retaining the patients on theirpanel and may naturally have difficulty in granting or refusinga continuance of a certificate for a few days if a man main-tains he is unfit.      It is widely felt in the coalfields thatmedical supervision is not as close as under the old system and that this goes a long way to account for benefit being paid more frequently and. for longer periods than in the past.7. It may be that from a strictly medical point of view and so far as the general well-being of the workers is con-cerned, this increase in absence from work through sickness and injury is justifiable.      There is no doubt - that the old system operated harshly and some increase in absence was to boexpected as the result of the new schemes.      It may be toothat by giving greater attention tc the well-being of theworkers today, a dividend will be received in years to come inthe shape of a stronger and healthier labour force.     Thequestion must be faced, however, whether at the present stage in the nation&apos;s affairs, increases in absenteeism of theextent that are being experienced in the coal industry can be afforded..     It is not only the cost of the benefits themselves,serious as that may be;    it is the loss of coal arising fromthis increased absenteeism which is the most serious aspect ofthe matter.8. While the problem is one which is unlikely to be confined to the coal industry and any necessary modifications in the arrangements could probably not be applied to minersalone, the situation in the coal - industry is probably worse than anywhere else and is in itself so serious as to call, inmy view, for special attention.

9* I suggest; therefore that a Committee should be setup forthwith consisting of representatives of the Ministryof Labour, Ministry of Health, Ministry of national insurance, Ministry of Fuel and Power and the National coal board to investigate the whole matter and bring forward proposals, for remedying it.      The Committee should, i suggest, not merely sit in London but visit the coalfieldsto obtain evidence at first hand.      It should be asked toreport by the end of July.Ministry of Fuel and Power,S. VI t 1.31 ST MAY,  19kS.
