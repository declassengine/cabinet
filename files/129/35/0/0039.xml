fHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJBSTTS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1949- &apos; - -,v.-.: &apos;. Vr tf. -       Q confidential Copy NVJ.1CP. (49) 14911th July, 1949 : .CABINETINTERCHANGE OF STAFF BETWEEN FOREIGN SERVICE  and commonwealth RELATIONS office memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth relations on 16th May (CM. (49) 35th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet invited usto consider what arrangements might be made for an interchange of staff between our two Departments.Two years ago it was agreed between us that past practice in the matter ofinterchange of staff for overseas posts should be regularised, and that thereshould be a policy of reciprocal interchange of staff at the First Secretary and second Secretary level. As a result of this agreement, two officers of the foreign service are already serving in United Kingdom High Commissioners&apos; Offices,one at Ottawa and one at Canberra; similarly, two officers of the commonwealth relations Office are serving in Foreign Office posts abroad, one in the UnitedKingdom Embassy at Washington and one with the Delegation to the united nations at New York.Arrangements of this nature which, while providing for an interchange of experience between the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office,also provide admirable training for the officers interchanged, will continue inthe future. It is to be recognised, however, that the availability of suitablepersonnel places a practical limitation on the extent to which the policy can beextended.Apart altogether from this, somewhat special arrangements exist in Indiaand Pakistan, which provide that officers dealing with Asiatic problems havea first-hand knowledge of Eastern conditions. In these countries, a considerablenumber of officers of the Foreign Service are serving, either in the UnitedKingdom High Commissioners&apos; Offices at New Delhi and Karachi, or at the out-stations, e.g., Calcutta, Bombay and Lahore. The United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Pakistan (Sir L. Grafftey-Smith) and the Deputy HighCommissioner in India (Mr. F. K. Roberts) are senior officers of the foreign service. One officer of the Commonwealth Relations Office (Mr. G. E. Crombie)is serving in a Foreign Service post in this Counsellor at Rangoon.These arrangements in India and Pakistan are admittedly of a transitionalcharacter, due to the circumstances in which the United Kingdom high commissioners&apos; posts in India and Pakistan were established, and in particular to the uncertainty until recently as to the future status of these two Common-wealth countries. The position must clearly be reviewed as a matter both ofgeneral policy and of staffing policy. On the former, the Foreign Office take theview that their requirements are better met by posting officers to capitals than by-posting them to out-stations. On the latter, while each Department is faced atthe present time with staff shortages, both Departments recognise that the services in India and Pakistan must be effectively maintained, and that consequentlychanges must be gradual.It has already been agreed that a Mission should visit India and Pakistanin the autumn to inspect all United Kingdom High Commissioners&apos; establish -ments and the questions dealt with in the paragraphs immediately above will37254
fall to be considered by that Mission, which will be led by the Deputy Under-Secretary of State of the Commonwealth Relations Office (Sir Cecil Syers) andwill include a Foreign Service Inspector. Before the Mission leaves, it is intendedto discuss the problems that arise with the United Kingdom High commissioner in India (Sir Archibald Nye) who is visiting London for discussions in July.In short, the policy which the Cabinet had in mind is already in being and measures are in hand to ensure that its application shall he carried rait inthe most effective manner.The Prime Minister has been informed of these arrangements and liasexpressed his agreement with the views expressed in this memorandum.E. B.P. J. N.-B.Uth July, 1949.
