MIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)--------.-------------------------------------------------17?SECRET 1c. p. (49)  143 COPY NO.23RD JUNE,  1949CABINETCIVIL SERVANTS AND INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESMemorandum by the Home secretary at a meeting of the Emergencies Committee on 21st June(E. C. (49) 7th Meeting, Minute 1) it was agreed that I should arrange, in consultation with the Postmaster General and theFinancial Secretary, Treasury, for the submission to the cabinet of the question whether, in the event of an industrial dispute,civil servants should be allowed to refuse to undertake workdifferent from but analogous to that on which they areordinarily employed, on the ground that by doing this workthey would be taking sides in the dispute.2. The question has arisen in connection with the plans which the Post Office, in common with other Departments, aremaking in case there should be a railway strike.In normal times most long-distance letter mail iscarried by rail, but road vehicles driven by postmen, who are members of a manipulative grade, are used generally for con-surveying mail over short distances and in rural areas over longerdistances.      In a railway strike little or no mail could becarried by rail and, apart from the small amount that, might besent by air, all long-distance letter mail would have to becarried by road in order to maintain even a restricted postalservice.      The Post Office would be able to make available thenecessary vehicles for this purpose, but the Postmaster Generalconsiders that the Post Office staff of postmen drivers wouldprobably refuse to drive vehicles carrying letter mail normallycarried by rail, on the ground that by doing so they would betaking sides against the railwaymen on strike&apos;.      He believes that it would be inexpedient to contest this attitude on the partof the Post Office staff and he has accordingly suggested that,in the event of a railway strike, vehicles carrying letter mailnormally carried by rail should be driven by volunteer driversdrawn both from Post Office staffs and from outside sources.It might be necessary to supplement this provision by calling on service drivers, but the Postmaster General would.hope that thiswould prove to be unnecessary.An even more urgent problem than that of the conveyance of letter mails would be the provision of emergency transport tocarry telephonists to their exchanges in the event of a strikeinvolving London transport services.      An emergency scheme for thispurpose is ready to be brought into operation&apos;at short notice,but there is the same uncertainty as regards drivers as on the postal side.     The intention is to employ engineering workmen ona voluntary basis, as on the occasion of the recent Saturday busstrike, but, should an official- transport strike occur, engin-eering staff in the Post Office are expected to adopt the sameattitude as their colleagues on the postal side, i. e.  they cannotbe relied upon to y/ork the service on instruction.      Maintenanceof a telephone service from the very start is vital and could beeffected on an emergency basis (i.e.  Government calls only forthe first few hours) with skeleton staffs in position for some2h. hours.      It is calculated that this interval would be sufficientto allow the emergency transport service to be organised on thebasis of a general call for volunteers.

Some members of the Emergencies Committee share theviews of the Postmaster General, but others believe that nocivil servant, whatever his grade, has a right to refuse to dowork which is necessary to maintain essential services and isof a type analogous to that on which he is ordinarily employedon the ground that by doing the work he would be taking sidesin an industrial dispute, and they consider that it would be a grave mistake for the Government to do anything to imply thatthey recognised this right.3o The main considerations to be borne in mind are:-(a) In law civil servants are in the same position as other workers so far as the right to strike isconcerned.(b) The Government have taken the view that they wouldtake disciplinary action as employers against civilservants involved in a strike affecting certain essential services.      This view has hitherto beentaken in.relation to services of the most vitalcharacter such as those concerned with the mainten-ance of law and order.      Thus with the approval ofthe Lord President&apos;s Committee (L. P. (1+5) 45thMeeting, Minute 2) the. Attorney-General stated on12th February, 1946, in the debates on the TradeDisputes and Trade Unions Bill that some civilservants stood, by reason of the nature of their employment, in a particular relation to thecommunity and that in certain strike situations(e.g.  a strike of prison officers in disregard ofthe Whitley Council machinery) the Government wouldtake disciplinary action in the shape of instantdismissal without hope of reinstatement.(c) In recent times there have been very few strikes by civil servants and those that have occurred havebeen trivial in nature and short in duration.      Inthe general stoppage of 1926 no civil servants were called out on strike, but the Postmaster General wasthen faced with the same problems as are described in paragraph 2,On that occasion the Postmaster General wrote to the Post Office staff associations as follows:-&quot;Sir, - In reponse to your inquiries, I am directed by the Postmaster General to say that, in thelight of present circumstances, he is able tostate that Post Office servants will not berequired as a condition of service to performduties previously performed by railway or trans-port workers in the event of stoppage of workupon the railways or in the transport industry.Instructions have been issued accordingly, butit is. to be understood that this does not preventthe use of Post Office servants for loading and unloading vehicles used for the conveyance of mails normally sent by rail or by other means,or for duty for which any Post Office servantmay volunteer.It is possible that further developmentsmay necessitate a reconsideration of this assurance, in which case notification will be.sent to the Union.&quot;

(d)    The term &quot;civil servant&quot; covers a wide variety ofworkers and it is largely fortuitous that driversof Post Office vans are classed as civil servantswhereas engine drivers or stokers in gas works arenot. It may well seem highly anomalous to civilservants that disciplinary action should be taken against them to enforce the maintenance by them of. ; essential services normally run by other public servants against whom no such action is intended.On the other hand, once the principle that a civil servant may.withhold his services, whether in orderto press his own claims or in furtherance of a dispute in which he is not directly concerned, is admitted, it is hard to know where to draw the line.(e)    A distinction can be drawn between (i) requiring a civil servant to continue to discharge his normal. -    duties and (ii). requiring him to undertake, work ofa type.analogous to that on which he is ordinarilyemployed, the need for v/hich arises directly from astrike;    and there is also a difference according towhether the additional work is or is not connectedwith the maintenance of essential services.4. Applying these considerations to the practical problems with which/the Postmaster General is faced, I suggest that the choice lies between the following alternatives:-(1)    In the event of a railway strike the Postmaster......General should make it clear that the operation ofan emergency transport service for telephonists inLondon by engineering workmen is essential to the life of the community, and similarly that it is   *essential that postmen drivers should carry by roadmails which would normally go by rail.      He shouldalso make it clear that any worker who refused toundertake the work necessary for the operation ofthese services would be dismissed.Such a course of action involves the risk of a widespread strike among the Post Office staff, butit is a question whether this risk is outweighed bythe importance of maintaining the principle that inany industrial dispute in which they are not directly concerned civil servants, whatever theirgrade, should continue to discharge their normalduties and undertake any tasks analogous to their normal duties that they may be asked to perform inorder to maintain essential services.(2)   The Postmaster General should deal with the situationsolely on a voluntary basis.In 1926 recourse was had to voluntary driversand, although on the present occasion steps havenot been taken in advance t.o organise a generalcall for volunteers, the Postmaster General is reasonably confident that measures could very quickly be improvised.      The telephone service can,in his view, be maintained on a skeleton Governmentbasis without a break;    on the postal side therewould be a short interval before the emergency road  &apos;transport service started, but it must be recognisedthat there would be a serious stoppage of mailsfor a few days.

If the former of the foregoing alternatives is adopted there is,  in the view of the PostmasterGeneral, a serious risk of a general strike through-out, the Post Office,  resulting in the paralysis ofthe whole communications system of the country,including not only the postal, telephone and tele-graph services but also the system of private wiresbetween Government Departments.      The FinancialSecretary,/Treasury, shares the view that such a risk would.arise but thinks it would.be less likelywhere postmen drivers are asked to extend theirjourneys (where the work would be definitelyanalogous) than where other grades are asked toundertake similar work.Ja C E.Home Office, S.W. 1-. .23RD JUNE, 1949.
