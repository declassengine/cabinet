(49) 11th Conclusions, Minute 4 (*fc), we circulate, forthe information of our colleagues (i) a memorandum on the Soviet industrial potential prepared in theForeign Office (Annex A);(ii) a memorandum on the economic war potential of the U.S.S.R., prepared in the Ministry of Defence (Annex B).The first compares the economic resources of the Soviet bloc with those ofthe rest of the world under various groupings of countries, and makes certaindeductions as to the resources available for armaments having regard to otherneeds. The second examines current intelligence estimates of the U.S.S.R.&apos;military strength in the light of her economic resources and by comparison withthe United Kingdom.   We are jointly agreed on these two memoranda.2. Although the conclusions put forward in these papers are necessarilytentative, they throw an interesting light on Russia&apos;s military strength, bothpresent and future. It will be seen that the proportion of the national incomedevoted to armaments proper (as opposed to pay and maintenance of personnel)is not so very much greater in the U.S.S.R. than it is in the United Kingdom andthe United States (the figures being 8 per cent., 5% per cent, and 4 per cent,respectively). It would be wrong, however, to conclude from this that Russia is less of a menace to her neighbours than is commonly supposed. In the first place,she devotes a larger proportion of her total defence expenditure to the mainte-nance of service personnel than either the United Kingdom or the United States,with the result that, while only spending about 2^ times as much on actual arma-ments as we do, she maintains armed forces roughly 5 times the size of ours,amounting in all to about 4 million men. It must also be remembered that Russiahas at her disposal the resources of the satellite countries, whose forces havestandardised arms and training with the Red Army, making a greatly increasedtotal force. In the past, Russia has tended to rely on her overwhelming mass ofman-power : these figures seem to show that that is still her policy and that sheerweight of numbers must continue to be reckoned an important factor in herfavour. Moreover, although Soviet industrial production is at present greatlyinferior to that of the Western Powers, this disparity is likely to be sharplyreduced in the course of the next ten years. It is also probable that the Sovieteconomy, being more simple than that of the United Kingdom or the United

The purpose of this paper is (i) To set out all available information regarding the present and prospectiveindustrial potentials (with special reference to coal, oil, steel, chemicals and non-ferrous metals) of (a) The Soviet Union plus Satellites (including the Soviet Zone ofGermany, Finland and North China).(6) O.E.E.C. countries (other than the United Kingdom) including their dependent overseas territories.(c) The United Kingdom and its dependent overseas territories.(d) The United States, Canada and other parts of America not included in (b) and (c).(e) The rest of the world.(ii) To make what deductions may be possible therefrom as to the resources available for armaments in the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R.having regard to the needs of economic reconstruction and expansion and to the maintenance and development of standards of livingregarded as reasonable in each case.Summary of conclusions. The production of basic industrial commodities in the Soviet Union and states allied to it is substantially inferior to the production of these commodities in O.E.E.C. countries. Compared with the production of the commonwealth and the United States the inferiority of that of the U.S.S.R. is even more marked.This disparity between the &quot;Red Bloc&quot; and O.E.E.C. countries may largelydisappear by 1960, even if the latter can reach and maintain the industrial targetswhich they have set themselves for 1952-53. The U.S.S.R. will, however, evenin 1960 remain greatly inferior to the Commonwealth and the United States inproductive resources.3. No satisfactory estimates are available of the proportions of the basicindustrial commodities which are currently devoted to armaments production, hutit may be assumed that they are small, even in the U.S.S.R. It is possible thatthe U.S.S.R., owing to the less complicated structure of its economic system,would be able rapidly to switch a greater proportion of such resources to arma-ments production than could the United Kingdom or the United States.4. The industrial strength of the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom and theUnited States can, however, best be measured by their total industrial productionand national income. In this the U.S.S.R. has a preponderance over the UnitedKingdom of perhaps 50 per cent, as measured by national income, but producesStates, could be more rapidly and completely switched over to war production.Operating on interior lines of communication, and with a huge investment pro-gramme and organised fifth columns in most of the surrounding countries, Russiatherefore remains a formidable menace to each of her neighbours, and in spite ofher relative economic weakness she is far less open to economic pressure from outside than Germany was.3. We have not been able to find any inconsistency between current estimates of the U.S.S.R.&apos;s military potential and her economic resources so far as they are known. The latter appear adequate now for a major war of short duration;they may not be considered adequate before about 1957 to sustain successfully a major war involving a consistently high rate of wastage.E.

less than one-third as much as the United States. In spite of this the U.S.S.R.devotes a larger proportion of total output to reconstruction and expansion. Shealso devotes a proportion 60 per cent, higher than the United Kingdom to theproduction of defence goods* (8 as against 5^ per cent.). The proportion devotedto consumption in the U.S.S.R. is therefore correspondingly small. Nevertheless,considerable efforts are being made to increase the standard of living of the Russianpeople, although quality is inevitably sacrificed to quantity and the standard of consumption is far below the levels considered reasonable in Western Europe.5. In both the U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom the rate of economic expansion, as measured by the proportion of national income devoted to netinvestment, could be increased by 35-40 per cent, if there was no production ofarmaments.6.   The conclusion of this analysis is therefore mainly negative : (i) The relative economic weakness of the U.S.S.R. and its allies comparedwith the free world is not proportionate to the influence they are ableto wield abroad in other ways,(ii) The people of the U.S.S.R. have long been conditioned to a low level of consumption and a higher proportion of current output can thereforebe devoted to net investment and armaments than in the UnitedKingdom. There is no reason to think that this is causing economic difficulties inside the Soviet Union, especially as economic recovery isbringing some increases in standards of consumption to the population,and the existing regime is so powerfully backed by an iron dictatorshipthat political difficulties can be completely ruled out.Methods of Comparison7. The comparison of the industrial potential of the U.S.S.R. with that ofother countries can be conducted in three ways : (1) Direct comparison may bemade of the output of specific basic commodities : (2) Comparative estimates maybe made of the total volumes of output: (3) Comparisons.may be made of thedistribution of the national incomes of countries between various types of pro-ductive activity. It has been found that each of these methods throws some lighton the extent of armaments and other defence goods production in the U.S.S.R.in relation to the total economic effort. They will therefore each be considered in turn.Production of Basic Commodities8. Estimates of the production of basic industrial goods in various partsof the world in 1948 are given in Appendix I. The areas chosen are to someextent arbitrary (e.g., North China is included in the &quot; Soviet Bloc &quot; and SouthChina excluded), but virtually no difference is made in the general picture by making slightly different assumptions, since the production of these basic corn-modi ties by the &quot; marginal &quot; regions is negligible. The result which emerges isthat, judging by this criterion, the Soviet industrial potential is stillcomparatively small.9. A comparison between the output of basic commodities in the &quot; RedBloc &quot; and in O.E.E.C. countries shows that according to this criterion O.E.E.C.countries are relatively well placed.O.E.E.C. countries and their dependentOutput in 1948 &quot; Red Bloc &quot;        overseas territoriesCoal      ............ 100 115OilSteelCopper ...AluminiumNitrogen100 200t100 162100 180100 147100 250Sulphuric Acid ...... 100 188* Throughout this paper &quot; defence goods &quot; is taken to cover those goods and services coveredby defence expenditure other than the pay, allowances and maintenance of service personnel,f Including production of companies in the Middle East and elsewhere.
10. If, alternatively, we consider the combined resources of the Common-wealth, the United States and the rest of America (but exclude ContinentalEurope), the preponderance over the &quot; Red Bloc &quot; is still more striking : Commonwealth,United States&quot; Red Bloc &quot;        and rest of AmericaCoal      ............ 100 227Oil                           ...... 100 1,304*Steel     I:&apos;.       ......... 100 406Copper............ 100 590Aluminium      ......... AUU JaoNitrogen         ......... 100 300Sulphuric Acid         ...... 100 i&quot;11. So far as the immediate future is concerned, no significant change islikely to take place in this balance. Estimates for production in the &quot; Red Bloc &quot;can be made up to 1950 (the last year of the current Five-Year Plan). By thenSoviet production will have increased beyond the 1948 figures, but not at a ratesubstantially greater than that planned by O.E.E.C. countries. No reliable fore-casts are available of production in 1950 in America or in commonwealth countries other than the United Kingdom, but it is certain that the figures givenin paragraph 10 will not be significantly modified by 1950.12. If we look further ahead, the only Soviet figures available are the&apos;&apos; tentative goals &apos;&apos; set by Stalin in 1946 for Soviet production of coal, oil andsteel, which might be attainable &quot; after 3 five-year plans if not more.&quot; If we assume that these targets are attained in 1960, we can compare possible &quot; RedBloc &quot; production of coal, oil and steel in that year with the production ofO.E.E.C. countries in 1952-53 and of the United States and commonwealth in 1948.O.E.E.C.countries andtheir dependent   United States and&quot; Red Bloc &quot;   overseas territories   Commonwealth1960 1952-53 1948Coal   ...       ...          100 78 127Oil    ......         100 179t 774tSteel......          100 91 16013. These comparisons of industrial potential based on a few of the mostimportant materials do not, however, give much indication of the relative strengths of the military establishments which these groups of countries could support. Thisis partly because their basic materials are equally useful for war and civilian purposes and can relatively quickly be switched from the latter to the former, butalso because the minimum amount of each commodity which must be employed for non-armament purposes to keep an economic system alive varies greatlyaccording to the nature of that system.14. This may be illustrated by taking the case of steel. In 1940 the U.S.S.R.produced 18-3 million tons of steel, of which 800,000 was allocated to ammunitionproduction, leaving 17-5 million tons or 88 kg. per head for civilian and generalarmament purposes. In 1943 production had fallen to some 8 million tons,supplemented by imports which directly and indirectly increased supplies by -6 million tons. Of this no less than 2^ million tons was allocated to ammunition,leaving 9 million tons or about 70 kg. per head in &quot; unoccupied U.S.S.R.&quot; for civilian and general armament purposes. There is no reliable estimate of theconsumption of steel in armaments other than ammunition, although it may besaid that in war-time ammunition consumption of steel is over 50 per cent, oftotal armament consumption of steel. From this it may be deduced that steelconsumption to-day by the armament industries proper is not likely to be muchmore than 10 per cent, of total steel consumption for all uses.15. In general it may be said that economic systems which are more highlyindustrialised require a much higher consumption of steel per head of population* Including production of companies in the Middle East and elsewhere,t Including the production  of controlled companies.
if they are to be kept going. The following figures show steel consumption per head of population in certain countries.at various times : Steel Consumption per Head in Kilog.United Kingdom (1890) 100 United States (1890) 70 U.S.S.R. (1932) 36United Kingdom (1900) 120 United States (1900) 130 U.S.S.R. (1940) 95United Kingdom (1929) 220 United States (1929) 480 U.S.S.R. (1948) 90United Kingdom (1948) 300      United States (1948) 590      Europe, excludingU.S.S.R. (1947) 91So far as steel consumption goes, the U.S.S.R. to-day appears to be at the stage reached by the United Kingdom and the United States 50-60 years ago. while this implies comparative industrial weakness, nevertheless it carries with it acertain advantage. Since the system is better conditioned to carry on with a lowconsumption of steel, a larger proportion of output may, in case of need, more rapidly be switched directly to armament production.16. Similar considerations apply to the other basic industrial materials,although there are no reliable clues from which we can calculate the amounts of them which are used directly for armaments production in the U.S.S.R. Allthat can be said is that the comparisons given can do no more than indicate thetotal amount of certain types of industrial output which, given proper use and time, might be mobilised for war production.Comparisons of Total Output17. The effective economic strength of a country is best measured by its total output rather than by its output of selected basic materials, since such ameasurement takes account of the skill of its labour force, its trading position,and similar factors. Such a measurement may be either in terms of &quot; labourpower &apos;&apos; on the basis of the size and the efficiency of the labour force, or in termsof the value of output in terms of national currency. But this leads to great difficulties in making international comparisons, since assumptions have to bemade either about the relative efficiencies of labour or about the relative real value of currencies in various countries. However, Soviet statistics are frequentlymisleading and great care has to be taken in their interpretation. The statisticswhich follow must be regarded therefore as tentative, although it is believed thatthe general picture which they show is reasonably correct. In these paragraphs the comparisons will be limited to the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom and theUnited States.18. The industrial working populations of the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdomand the United States in 1948 are estimated to have been as follows (inmillions) : U.S.S.R.     United Kingdom   United StatesMining        ......... 0-8 0-8 10Construction......... 2-2 1-4 2-6Manufacturing industries ... 11-7 7-4 17-other industrial occupations and transport     ...... 15-7 8-9 30-6So far as manufacturing industries are concerned, it has been calculated that output per head in the United Kingdom was, before the war, just under halfwhat it was in the United States, and that this relationship has not substantiallychanged. In 1937 the Russians claimed that their output per head in industry had already caught up with that of the United Kingdom, but it is probablethat this claim, even if true, applied only to a limited range of products, andthe most commonly accepted American estimates give output per head in theU.S.S.R. at some 40 per cent, of that in the United States. Comparisons formining, construction, transport and services are not satisfactory owing to widevariations of conditions. Our estimates of comparative total outputs in maniT-facturing industries in 1948 are therefore approximately : U.S.S.R.      ...    :...........       iooUnited Kingdom      ...      ...      ...      ... 80United States............... 380
19. This table, however, over-estimates the net output of the UnitedKingdom, since a large proportion of its manufactures have to be exported in exhange for food-stuffs and raw materials which in the case of the U.S.S.R.and the United States are produced at home. Account can be taken of this factorif a comparison is made of net national incomes. Such a comparison can onlybe given with all reserve owing to the difficulty inherent in estimating the purchas-ing power of the various types of roubles used in Soviet national income statistics.*Indices of Net National Incomes in 1948Total Per headU.S.S.R.......... 100 100United Kingdom...... 81 243United States     ...... 354 468The Distribution of Resources20. In spite of the relatively low level of total output in the Soviet Union,its distribution between various uses provides for a high rate of investment expenditure at the expense of current consumption. In comparisons of national income distributions between the U.S.S.R. and other countries one of the diffi-culties in the past has been the estimate of the proportion devoted to armaments.Total defence expenditure has not been a very good guide, since this includes aconsiderable element of &quot; consumption &quot; corresponding to the pay, allowances, &amp;c,of Service personnel. It is, however, now possible to estimate from figurespublished for the year 1940 the amount of defence expenditure which excludes&quot;personal consumption of Service personnel&quot; i.e., armaments expenditureproper. Corresponding estimates have also been made for the United Kingdomand the United States.Percentage Distribution of Net National Incomes in 1948U.S.S.R. United Kingdom United StatesNet investment ......       21 15 11Consumption    ...       ...       ...      71 79^ 85Expenditure on defence goods        8 5-1 4Investment21. The high level of net investment in the U.S.S.R. has been the most striking feature of its economy ever since the beginning of the five-year plans in1928. This rate of investment, which is higher than the highest rate achieved in the United States during its period of greatest expansion, has made possiblethe emergence within less than a generation of the U.S.S.R. as a first-class indus-trial Power. There is no evidence that there is likely to be any decrease in this rate of progress in the near future. Nevertheless, by combining the totals inparagraphs 19 and 20 it can be seen that the total net addition to real capital inthe U.S.S.R. in 1948 was about half what it was in the United States, thoughdouble the United Kingdom figure. Even making allowances for cyclical fluctua-tions in United States economic activity it is clear that the task which the Sovietshave set themselves to catch up with the United States will be long and arduous.Consumption22. Large investments in the U.S.S.R. have only been made possible by holding down consumption. The tables in paragraphs 19 and 20 suggest thattotal consumption in the U.S.S.R. is no more than 40 per cent, higher than in theUnited Kingdom, and consumption per head only about 35 per cent, of the UnitedKingdom level. This is in large part due to the very low level of non-food con-sumption of the rural population of the U.S.S.R., but even the urban population has a much lower standard of living than in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless,it would be unwise to conclude from this that the Soviet authorities are not making very considerable efforts to increase the supplies of consumer goods. Interms of calories food supplies are quite adequate, though lacking the varietywhich even now is available to United Kingdom consumers.     The quality of* For an analysis of the national income in the U.S.S.R. see Appendix II.
textiles and housing accommodation is much lower in the U.S.S.R.; in Soviethomes overcrowding is severe and even in new houses the amount of space avail-able per head is only a quarter of that in the United Kingdom. Great efforts havenevertheless been made to increase the quantities made available.23. Some indication of the comparative efforts made since the end of the warby the U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom in satisfying certain basic consumerneeds is given by the following figures :  Production per Head in the Three Years 1946-8(Approximate figures)U.S.S.R. United KingdomNew urban houses built (sq. yds.) ... -968                   1-130Rural dwellings built or repaired ... -012                     -015Cotton textiles (sq. yds.)     ...... 45-56 88-0*Woollen textiles (sq. yds.)...... 1-84 18-0*Rubber footwear (pairs)   ...... -77 1-1Leather footwear (pairs)    ...... 1-99                    . -* Includes a certain amount of exported made-up industrial cloth.24. The available evidence suggests that the present distribution of resources in the U.S.S.R. enables the authorities to supply the civilian population with an increasing quantity of consumer goods (doubtless of low quality), and to establish a standard of living still far below the standards of Western Europe butapproaching Soviet pre-war standards and likely substantially to improve in thefuture.Expenditure on Defence Goods25. The figures given in the tables in paragraphs 19 and 20 indicate that expenditure on defence goods in the U.S.S.R. in 1948 was about 2^ times as great as in the United Kingdom. This expenditure supported armed forces roughlyfive times as great. Although precise comparison is impossible it seems that theU.S.S.R. is forced to spend a higher proportion of its total defence expenditureon the maintenance of service personnel and a lower proportion on defence goods.In each case expenditure on defence goods is a relatively small proportion ofnational income, although net investment could be increased by 35 per cent, ifarmaments could disappear, and an additional burden is that the man-powerneeds of the armed forces mean the withdrawal from productive employment ofabout 4 per cent, of the labour force in each country.Conclusion26. The analysis of the national incomes of the U.S.S.R. and the UnitedKingdom indicates that their distribution between various uses is not so widelydifferent as is sometimes supposed. The fact that the United Kingdom has a&quot;mature&quot; economy and the U.S.S.R. a young and expanding one is itself a reason for the greater proportion of resources devoted to consumption in theUnited Kingdom. Another reason is the greater proportion of old persons inthe United Kingdom population. In each case the proportions devoted to consump-tion seem to be reasonable given the standards of living to which the peoples of the two countries have been accustomed. The residue could in the absenceof international fears be entirely devoted to reconstruction and expansion, andfor this there is clearly larger scope in the U.S.S.R. than in the United Kingdom.The proportions of this residue which each country devotes to arms production is roughly similar.Economic Intelligence Department,Foreign Office,10th May, 1949.

The Long-Term Programmes for theO.E.E.C. countries and their dependent overseas territories bring the total 1952-53. production for the rest of Europe and dependent overseas territories to 285 million tons and for the United Kingdom and dependent overseas territories to258 - 4 million tons.oil the oilfields under Soviet influence are not capable of the expansion possiblein those under Western control. The Soviet Five-Year Plan sets the 1950 targetat 35-4 million tons and with slight expansion in the other countries of the Bloc,brings the area target to 44 millions. Expansion of French controlled oil(especially in Iraq) accounts for the rise in the other Continental countries to6-4 million tons and in United Kingdom and Anglo-Dutch controlled production to 101-2 million by 1952-3. In this latter expansion that of the Middle Eastplays the most significant part as it does in the rise in United States controlled and other American production to 475 million tons, estimated for 1951.SteelThe importance attached by the U.S.S.R. and its satellites to the restorationand expansion of steel production is illustrated by the 1950 target of 34-5 million tons, an importance also realised by O.E.E.C. countries, where by 1952-3 produc-tion by the Continental participants is to be 40-7 million tons, and in the UnitedKingdom 17 millions.Non-Ferrous Metals and ChemicalsThe plans for the U.S.S.R. and Soviet-controlled countries indicate that by1950 the production of copper, nitrogen and sulphuric acid is to be about one-thirdhigher than in 1948 and that aluminium output is to be no less than 80 per cent,higher. The O.E.E.C. Continental countries are planning slightly higher rates of increase, to be achieved by 1952-3. No figures for the United Kingdom areavailable, but probably increases will be at a rather lower rate than in the other.E.E.C. countries. The 1948 figures give an unrealistic figure of non-SovietAsian production, as the Japanese potential is far higher than the figuresindicate.
Appendix II to Ajstnex A -The National Income of the U.S.S.R.Official figures for the Soviet national income require three types of adjust-ment before they can be made comparable with United Kingdom and United Statesfigures. These adjustments involve (a) consideration of the various kinds of&quot; roubles &quot; used in Soviet accounting; (b) estimates of services excluded from theSoviet concept of national income and included in the British and American;(c) choice of a factor for conversion of roubles into sterling ;and dollars.2. Soviet national income figures are officially given in terms of roubles of1926-27 value. These are unsatisfactory since the prices for agricultural products in 1926-27 were far below normal in relation to industrial products.Soviet budget figures and other important statistics are, however, given in currentroubles. There has been an additional complication since 1940 because currentroubles are used only for wages, consumers&apos; prices, &amp;o, while transactions betweenState enterprises and the pricing of intermediate products have been kept in termsof pre-war (1940) roubles. In this paper estimates for the Soviet national incomeare made in roubles of 1940 value.3. Figures for the gross national product and net national income for 1940in terms of 1926-27 roubles (including armaments expenditure exclusive of con-sumption of service personnel) can be obtained from M. Voznesenski&apos;s book &quot; TheWar Economy of the U.S.S.R. during the Patriotic War.&quot; The non-agriculturalitems have been multiplied by the factor 1-5 to convert into 1940 roubles, this factor being calculated from the average of certain known changes in industrialprices. Gross and net agricultural production in terms of 1940 roubles are thosecalculated by P. A. Baran (Review of Economic Statistics, November 1947).Finally, following Baran&apos;s calculation, an addition of one-ninth is made so as toinclude services excluded from the Soviet national income concept. these calculations lead to a net national income in 1940 of 282,000 million roubles at1940 prices. The figure may be checked with one of 303,000 million roublescalculated by Baran using an entirely independent method. .4. Estimates for 1948 in terms of 1940 roubles can now be obtained. Figuresfor the gross production of industrial producer and consumer goods can be calculated from plan figures, and those for agricultural by comparing 1940 and1948 harvest results. Figures for transport and services are estimates based onthe 1940 figures. Armament expenditure on defence goods in 1948 is calculatedby assuming the cost of maintaining service personnel to be the same as in 1940.since the size of the armed forces was roughly the same.5. The gross national product and the net national income of the U.S.S..R.in 1948 in billion roubles of 1940 purchasing power are, therefore, as follows :  Gross National Product, 1948Industrial producer goods       ...   168   Savings        ...       ...      ......     61Industrial consumer goods       ...     78   Expenditure on defence goods   ...     23Agriculture        ...      ...       ...   11.1   Personal Consumption of :- Services and transport   ...       ...   125      Industrial goods  ...      ...   78Agricultural goods ... 78Services and transport   ...   54- 210Purchase^byenterprises of : Industrial goods  ...      ...   84Agricultural goods ... 33Services and transport   ...   71- 188Gross  product       ...      ....   482 Gross expenditure     ... 482National Income, 1948Net investment     ...       ... 61Consumption        ...      ... ---      210Expenditure on armament gocis        ...      ...      ...        23
6. In order to convert &quot; 1940 roubles &quot; into dollars, Baran&apos;s estimate of 9-73(1940) roubles = l (1940) dollar has been taken as giving a reasonably likelyapproximation. If an allowance is now made for the change in United Stateswholesale prices between 1940 and 1948 this gives 4-67 (1940) roubles ^1 (1948)dollar. In terms of dollars of 1948 purchasing power, therefore, the figures forthe national incomes of the U.S.S.R., United Kingdom and United States in 1948are :   Million dollarsU.S.S.R................      63,000United Kingdom     ............      39,000United States ............    223,000ANNEX BEconomic War Potential of the U.S.S.R.This paper examines current intelligence estimates of the U.S.S.R.&apos;s military strength in the light of her economic resources and by comparison with the UnitedKingdom.Current Soviet military strength2. The following table compare^,, n very summary form and in purelyquantitative terms, the current military strengths of the U.S.S.R. and the UnitedKingdom, the figures for the U.S.S.R. having been provided by the joint intelligence Committee.*U.S.S.R.

For the current maintenance and gradual re-equipment of these forces theoutput of certain selected military items is estimated as follows : Monthly OutputAircraftof which Military types ...      ...      .......Tanks and self-propelled gunsMotor vehicles!Co-relation of military and economic potential5. It is argued that, when the industrial capacities of the two countries arecompared, the defence effort of the U.S.S.R. as estimated above represents a burdenbeyond her capabilities, or at least disproportionate to the resources she has avail-able for the maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion of her civilian economy.It has been pointed out, for instance, that the Russians are apparently maintainingarmed forces about five times as large as our own, are producing about six times* Including 275,000 coast defence troops,t Estimated for 1949.% Load carriers only.
as many aircraft and thirty-three times as many tanks; yet this effort, it isargued, is backed by an industry whose output of basic commodities such as steel,coal and power is not much in excess of that of the United Kingdom and whichis having to devote a larger effort to the repair of the ravages of war. Thefollowing paragraphs suggest some of the reasons why this paradox is moreapparent than real.Nature of the Military Effort6. Several factors tend to reduce the apparently much greater economicburden which the current Soviet military effort represents. A simple comparison of military strengths takes no account of such factors as differences in the technicalquality of equipment, in the training, standard of pay, rations, allowances and welfare in the forces, and the effort devoted to research and development. Someof these, particularly maintenance and pay of the forces, are markedly lower inthe U.S.S.R. than in this country.7. Moreover, the disparity in absolute numbers in the armed forces virtuallydisappears when these are expressed as a percentage of the populations of thetwo countries (roughly 2 per cent, in each case).The Comparison of Overall Economic and Industrial Capacity8. Annex A attempts a comparison of the economic strengths of the U.S.S.R.and United Kingdom. It concludes that, as measured by national income, theU.S.S.R. has a preponderance of some 50 per cent, over the United Kingdom, and,as measured by the output of manufacturing industries (calculated from labourdistribution and applying a relative efficiency factor), a preponderance of about25 per cent, over the United Kingdom. So far as this kind of comparison goes,it shows that the argument in paragraph 5, above, considerably underestimatesthe U.S.S.R.&apos;s economic and industrial power.The Comparison of expenditure. Annex A further calculates that expenditure in the U.S.S.R. in 1948 on defence purposes other than the pay and allowances of the armed forces, thoughsomething over twice as great as in the United Kingdom, was still only about per cent, of the national income as against the 5\ per cent, in this country. Thepercentage devoted to armaments proper would, in each case, be smaller still. Theconclusion from these figures is that the burden of defence expenditure in theU.S.S.R. in proportion to total resources is not markedly greater than it is inthis country.The Comparison of Output of Basic Commodities10. A direct comparison of the output of basic commodities in the U.S.S.R.and the United Kingdom shows that the U.S.S.R.&apos;s present output in absolute terms is, in several instances, about equal to, or little greater than, that of theUnited Kingdom. The limitations of this form of comparison as a criterion ofindustrial effort and war potential must, however, be strongly stressed. Twoexamples, coal and steel, may be taken.11. Coal. It is true that the calorific value of the United Kingdom&apos;s coaloutput in 1948 was appreciably greater than the U.S.S.R.&apos;s output of hard andbrown coal and peat. Nevertheless, there was little difference in the amountsavailable for home use in the two countries, and because of differences in theconsumption pattern the industries of the U.S.S.R. actually received about24 million tons (or 40 per cent.) more than the industries of the United Kingdom,despite the fact that the Russian railways required three times as much.12. Steel. The U.S.S.R.&apos;s output of steel is now at an annual rate approach-ing 20 million tons, and is planned to rise to 25 million tons in 1950. This compares with the current output in the United Kingdom of about 15 million tons.13. The comparison of the availability of steel for home consumption, how-ever, shows that the U.S.S.R.&apos;s position is relatively even more favourable, theUnited Kingdom&apos;s supplies being reduced by nearly 2 million tons on foreign trade balance and the U.S.S.R.&apos;s increased by the considerable imports providedby reparations and by dismantling of machinery, machine tools, railway track, &amp;c,in the Soviet Zone of Germany.
14. In any case the amount of steel consumed in the U.S.S.R. directly inarmament production is not large. The estimated output of armaments of all types could, it is considered, be met from about 2J million tons of steel ingots,or a little over 10 per cent, of availabe supplies. It has not been possible.to obtain an authoritative comparable figure of United Kingdom consumption in armamentmanufacture, but in any case the figure for the U.S.S.R. does not much exceed the ingot equivalent of the United Kingdom&apos;s net exports of crude and finished steel.15. A further comparison may be made between current Soviet productionand German production of steel in the three immediate pre-war years. Thefigures for Germany (in million tons) were as follows : 1937      ......       .............      19-81938      ..................      22-61939      ..................      22-5By 1950 the U.S.S.R. will have surpassed these figures.16. Although it is generally accepted that steel production is as good asingle yardstick of industrial strength as any, the irreducible civil requirementsof countries with widely differing standards of living vary so much that it is avery uncertain measure of military potential; Japan exerted a formidablemilitary effort on the basis of an annual production of a mere 8 million tons.The Comparison of Installed Machine Tools17. A further possible method of comparison is by numbers of installedmachine tools.   Here the only available up-to-date figures are : U.S.S.R. ......      1,500,000 (1950 plan)United Kingdom        ... 900,000 (estimate for 1949)Germany ......       1,737,100 (1945)The bare figures do not, however, allow for differences in quality and efficiency.It is probable that the application of this factor would reduce somewhat the apparent superiority of the U.S.S.R. over the United Kingdom. A large numberof Germany&apos;s machine tools have been removed to the U.S.S.R. however, and.these were of the highest quality.The Comparison of the Chemical Industries18. In any comparison of the chemical industries the best single measureis output of sulphuric acid.   The relevant figures are as follows : U.S.S.R.  Million tons1940-41 ............ 4-01948 (estimated) ......... 2-61950 (Plan)      ............ 5-united Kingdom (1948)     ......... 1-55Germany (1938).........       ... 2-25Comparison with the Last War19. The table in the Appendix shows the output in 1943 and 1944 of air-craft, tanks and self-propelled guns and artillery in the U.S.S.R., United States,United Kingdom and Germany, together with the steel output in each case.Although allowance must be made for differences of types, particularly in aircraft,as well as for the indirect contribution made by Lease-Lend, the achievements of theU.S.S.R., while still suffering from the loss of industrial capacity through invasion,are impressive. Particularly striking is the fact that her output in 1943 of tanks and self-propelled guns was three times, and of artillery two and a half times, thatof the United Kingdom at a time when her steel supplies (i.e., her own outputplus Lease-Lend) were only 70 per cent, of the United Kingdom&apos;s domestic production. Obviously she could not have achieved these results if she had attempted a naval effort comparable to that of her allies or had devoted so muchof her industry to the material requirements of combined operations and strategicbombing. But these results were achieved when her steel production was lessthan half what it is to-day.
The Comparison of the Standard of Living20. The widely differing standards of living in the two countries are reflectedthroughout in the much smaller allocation of current resources in the U.S.S.R.to the needs of the consumer. (The Foreign Office have calculated Soviet con-sumption per head as only 35 per cent, of the United Kingdom&apos;s.) Althoughthe amount so allocated may be appropriate to the maintenance of a standardto which Russian people are accustomed, it allows a much larger allocation to capital re-equipment.21. To take a single example, the output of motor vehicles in the twocountries in 1948 compared as follows (figures in brackets being the 1950 plan) :  U.S.S.R. United Kingdom(In thousand units)Cars ......... 8-4   (65-6) 334-8Lorries and buses......      209-8 (434-4) 173-2Tractors    ...      ......        55-5 (112-0) 117-3Thus, although the total output of vehicles in the U.S.S.R. was less than half that of the United Kingdom, the U.S.S.R. was able, by neglecting almost entirelythe passenger-car demand, to produce rather more load-carrying vehicles thanthe United Kingdom.The Foreign Trade Requirement22. The United Kingdom is obliged to export a substantial proportion ofthe products of her manufacturing industries in order to import consumernecessities, particularly food. In some industries, notably the engineering indus-tries, this proportion is very high (e.g., locomotives about one-third, passenger carsover two-thirds, commercial motor vehicles one-half, metal working machine toolsone-third). The U.S.S.R. is under no such compulsion. Her foreign trade isa fraction of our own and, such as it is, its pattern is the reverse, i.e.,, primarilyan export of food-stuffs and timber against an import of capital equipment.The Future23. The future military capabilities of the U.S.S.R. must be judged againsteconomic capabilities very different from what they are to-day, as the following figures of output in 1948 compared with the plans for 1950 and 1960 show : Coal (million tons)Steel (million tons)   ...Power (million kWh.)Oil   (million tons)   ...Motor vehicles (thousand units)24. The &quot; 1960 &quot; figures may be regarded more as aspirations than targets,but if anything like them is, in fact, achieved, the U.S.S.R.&apos;s resources in, forexample, steel, will be twice the greatest production of steel ever available tothe Germans during the last war at the limit of their territorial expansion, andmore than four times what was available to the U.S.S.R. herself in 1944 from her own production and from Lease-Lend.Requirements in War25. The task of the Soviet economy in peace in relation to its armed forces isto maintain and gradually to re-equip them. Allowing for the necessary amountof obsolescence, wastage is infinitesimal compared to war conditions : damaged or obsolete material can be recovered; production of ammunition, which in warmakes heavy demands on steel, can be kept at a low level; and almost the wholeof new production is a net addition to the reserves of equipment.26. In war not only have the forces to be expanded rapidly, but they haveto be supplied at a rate sufficient to meet operational wastage. The adequacy ofthe Soviet, or any other, economy in war therefore depends on the scale, duration* These (with the exception of the figure for motor vehicles, which is an intelligence estimate)are the figures set by Stalin in 1946 as those which should be attainable &quot; after three Five-Year Plansif not more.&quot;1948	1950	1960*210	250	50017-7	25	6063-8	82	29028-6	35-4	60218	500	1,000
and intensity of the war, about which it is only possible to make assumptions.Wastage rates, however, are almost infinitely variable. Germany&apos;s greatestmilitary successes were gained at little cost in industrial effort; and her forces were shortest of equipment when her armaments production was at about itspeak.27. The most that can safely be said about the U.S.S.R. is that her economy to-day could certainly sustain a war, even a major war, of short duration. Thereis some doubt whether it could yet successfully sustain a prolonged major warinvolving a consistently high rate of wastage. There seems little doubt that itshould be in a position to do so within eight to ten years&apos; time. These assessmentscan, of course, take no account of the possible effects of Allied action against their economy.Conclusions28. Although there is no satisfactory method by which a country&apos;s war potential can be precisely calculated from its economic capabilities, the abovecomparisons strongly suggest that (a) the U.S.S.R.&apos;s present defensive effort as estimated is not beyond her economic resources and does not represent a markedly greater burdenupon her economy than does our own;(b) whether the present economic resources of the U.S.S.R. would be adequate for war depends upon the scale, nature and duration of the war andspecifically upon the rate of wastage it imposed;(c) the U.S.S.R.&apos;s economic resources are adequate for a war, even a major war, of short duration; they might well not be adequate before 1957for a prolonged major war involving a consistently high rate of wastage.Ministry of Defence,26th May, 1949.Appendix to Annex BWorld War IIOutput in UnitsOutput	.
