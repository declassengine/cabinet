HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET &apos;C. ?. (u10) 133 COPY NO.   J I22ND JUNE,  19U9CABINETBOMBING OF BRITISH&apos;SHIPPING IN THE YANGTSEMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty the British merchant ship &quot;Anchises&quot; was bombed and machine-gunned by Chinese Nationalist aircraft on the morning of 21st June, at the mouth of the Whangpoo river.She ran aground and suffered casualties.     She was againstrafed on the morning of the 22nd.2. The Nationalist Government have proclaimed a blockade of Communist held ports;    this v/e hold to be illegal,but they have in fact carried out several bombings of Shanghaiduring the last few days, without inflicting much damage;    asthe Communist forces have little or no anti-aircraft defence,greater boldness may be expected in the future.3* At the time of the bombing a British warship,H. M. S.  &quot;Black Swan&quot;, was stationed at an anchorage in the Yangtse river, with instructions that she might intervene toprevent Chinese warships interfering with British shippingoff the mouth of the Yangtse.     But if she cannot do this without using force, she is to report before taking action.She is not allowed to go up the Whangpoo river, a tributaryof the Yangtse on which Shanghai is located.k* When the &quot;Anchises&quot; was bombed, &quot;Black Swan&quot; movedup river to assist her, but finding her inside the Whangpooshe considered she could not help in accordance with her present instructions, and returned to the anchorage.     Theresult is the unsatisfactory situation in which a British shipmay be attacked and put in urgent need of assistance, with aBritish warship close by, and yet debarred from renderingsuch assistance.5. I feel, therefore, that there is an urgent need toamend the instructions to the British warship to make itclear that she is not forbidden, and indeed that it is herduty, to provide salvage or other humanitarian assistance toBritish shipping, even if this means going into internalwaters.6. Two issues will have to be made clear if the presentinstructions are to be amended on the lines proposed above..7. First, warships do not have the right of entry intointernal waters, and the Communist authorities at Shanghaihave announced that warships may not come to Shanghai (orpresumably enter the Whangpoo River) without their permission.This announcement is quite valid, as a normal- rule, but itcannot be justified, either in international law or in humanityif it is a question of a warship entering for the urgent dutyof assistance to damaged or distressed ships.

8. But, secondly, it will also Be necessary to securethat a warship carrying out these humanitarian tasks is notherself attacked by the forces on the bank, so leading to afresh incident.   . To meet this, I suggest that prior, not if i-cation of our intentions should be given to the Communistauthorities in Shanghai, explaining their clear justificationand asking them to agree that in such circumstances their forces will not molest our ships.9* The question also arises of retaliation againstthe Nationalist aircraft.      The Commander-in-Chief has nowissued orders that h. m.   Ships on Yangtse Patrol should fireat aircraft in the following circumstances:-(a) for self-defence;(b) at aircraft which have attacked British orother neutral merchant vessels whetherinside or outside territorial waters.He has been informed that this point is also being laidbefore Ministers, but I would ask my colleagues to endorsethis order.H.Admi r a It y, S. W. 1.22ND JUNE, 1949.
