? If . -    138 ?(THIS DOCUMENT IS THIS ?RO?ERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) ^|SECRET? C.x^(U9) 136 CO,JY NOM17TH JUNE, 19U9? $ ?CAB I NETHONG KONG:.   ATTITUDE OF OTHER 0OMMONlf/EALTH COUNTRIES| Memorandum by the Secretary of State for j||On 26th May (C.M.(/4-9) 33th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Cabinet invited me to inform the Governments of the other^^fl Commonwealth countries of the development of the situation inHong Kong, and of the decision to reinforce the garrison stillfurther;   and to ascertain whether those Governments would beprepared to support a policy of defending Hong Kong againstaggression by Communist forces from the mainland, and if needbe, to make at the appropriate stage public declarations insupport of that policy*   Instructions to approach otherCommonwealth Governments in this sense were despatched toUnited Kingdom High Commissioners on 27th May. &apos;2. The purpose of this paper is to indicate the response j^Hof other Commonwealth Governments to this approach. The^^fl present position may be suiimarised as follows*-J (a)   Canada.   The preliminary view of the CanadianI Prime Minister vms strongly critical of our intention toI retain Hong Kong on the ground that it would be regarded inI North America as wrong in principle to endeavour to maintainBritish rule by force in a Colony v/hich was geographicallypart of China.    It should be emphasised that this wasMr. St. Laurent&apos;s first reaction only:    he promised to studythe question and let us have a more considered view later.In the meantime, the Acting High Commissioner has been asked| to put certain further considerations to the Canadianauthorities, but it seems improbable that any final indication, of the Canadian Government&apos;s attitude will be forthcoming beforethe Canadian General Election on 27th June.(b)   Australia..     In the first approach made toMr. Chifley/ Itie agreed that Hong Kong must be defended againstany threat in the near future and supported the UnitedKingdom&apos;s decision to reinforce the Hong Kong garrison.(He has agreed to the use of the &quot;Georgic&quot; for carryingreinforcements and it is possible that an Australian troop-ship may be provided.)   But he was unwilling to commitAustralia further, even on this short-tern policy, because offears that if it is persisted in over a longer term it maylead to a major clash with a fully organised Communist China,with which (in Mr  Chifley&apos;s view) we shall, have, at anyrate in the long run, to come to terras.   Mr. Chifley thoughtthat we should attempt as soon as possible to reach agreementwith the Chinese Communists by means of direct negotiations,and that until such negotiations are shown to be impossible,nothing should bo done which might discourage the ChineseCommunists from preserving and cultivating China&apos;s contactsH . I
II If 1 - 139 Iwith the West#   our preliminary comments on Mr* chifley&apos;s ^|message, dealing particularly with his suggestion for ^|approaching the Chinese Communists, have already been tele- Hgraphed to the High Commissioner at Canberra and a further\ reply will be sent as soon as Ministers have considered the ^|policy- issues involved*iiS regards material assistance, Mr* Chifley in his Hreply of lst June said that he felt that the Australian H-^p- Cabinet ;iv/ould not be prepared to send material support to meet ^|a full-scale attack on Hong Kong,  for this would most likely ^|involve full-scale war v/ith the Chinese Government11 .Nevertheless, in an interview v/ith the High Commissioner on ^|llth June, Mr* Chifley hinted at the possibility of ships H^^fl I and. aircraft being sent from Australia, and said that if the ^|United Kingdom made enquiries these would be looked into verycarefully.   The advice of the High Commissioner was that weshould be unwise in these circumstances to make a formal &apos;^^fl request at the moment*    In accordance with his own suggestion^^fl he v/as therefore instructed to ascertain from Mr* Chifley^^fl v/hether the Australian Government would be prepared to entertainfavourably a request for certain specified types of assistance, ^|if the United Kingdom v/ere to make it, or alternatively whetbprI Australia was likely to volunteer an offer*The High commissioner has now been informed byMr* Chifley that at its meeting on 14th June there v/as Hstrong feeling in the Australian Cabinet against offeringanything in the nature of rqal military assistaiace to theUnited Kingdom at Hong Kong, since this v/ould involve the riskof Australian forces becoming involved in ua shooting waru j^^fl and the view was expressed (v/ith even greater force than inMr* Chifleyfs first message) that the right course is to cometo early terms v/ith the Chinese Communists*   Mr* Chifley hastold our High Commissioner that in the light of the AustralianCabinet* s viev/s, he would prefer not to receive a request Hfrom us for land forces, aircraft or warships, since thereply v/ould&apos; clearly be in the negative*   On the particularquestion of releasing the Mustangs at present in Japan,^ Mr* Chifley said that he certainly did not want to join in H^^fl an Approach to General MacArthur for the release of these Haircraft, v/hen Australia was now virtually alone in providingnyuwa-w,wr Commonv/ealth forces in Japan* H&gt;^^?w^c-v&lt;j^ g|| Australian authorities v/ould, however, if HW        * desired, readily look into the question of making available Hmaterial such as amm&apos;unition and medical supplies, as distinct^^fl from personnel*   Mr* Chifley also.asked for a full statement Hof the United Kingdom*s requirements of medical personnel* HThis the High comraissioner is supplying*   Mr* Chifley has, Hhowever, emphasised that^my medical personnel would have to Hbe volunteers* H* Mr* Praser has serft a personal message to HMr* Chifley stressing that Hong Kong is vital to Australia Hand New Zealand and must not be allowed to x&apos;all, and fI informing him of New Zealand1 s intention (see (c) below) HJ to give material assistance to the United Kingdom* HMr* Chifley&apos;s reply to this makes the Australian Iattitude a good deal sharper on a number of points*   It Hreveals Mr* Chifley&apos;s embarrassment at the effects that an H^^fl announcement of New Zealand help would have, and shews H^jkd       that he has asked Mr* Praser to ^consider most carefully ourviewpoint before you reach a final decisions   While the Hmessage recognises &apos;that &quot;the British are entitled and bound to III   * / I
I f 140 Iendeavour to retain Hong Kong, and that, for this purpose,some shew of force may be desirable, it somewhat inconsistentlyargues that there is a dangeri of over-simplification if thequestion is regarded as one of making Hong Kong the point tohold back Communist aggression in the Par East#   Finally, themessage makes it clear for the first time that thej Australian Government have it i|i mind to take ;;positive action&quot;J to bring the Chinese question, so far as it involves any9 I threat of aggression against Hong Kong, before the SecurityI Council i so that ^conciliation may replace force:&apos;.(c) Mew Zealand*     The High Commissioner reports thatMr. Fraser is realistically alive to the vital importance ofdefending Hong Kong and wholeheartedly accords his moral supportto this policy.   As regards material assistance, the NewZealand Cabinet have agreed that if the United KingdomGovernment require them, three frigates should be placed atour disposal, and Mr* Fraser has indicated that a fourth maybe available.   A study is being made- at Mr. Fraser&apos;s instance,of the possibility of a New Zealand air contribution also,and the possibility of obtaining medical assistance is alsobeing taken up.(d) South Africa.   Dr. Maian has told the HighCommissioner that United Kingdom policy in regard to HongKong has the moral support of the Union\ Government.   Sir EvelynBaring has commented thc.t &quot;as in the days of General Smuts,the Union Government will be prepared to support generallyany line we may v/ish to take on the advance of Communism inthe Far East, but will not offer material* help&quot;.(e) India.     Pandit Nehru&apos;s reaction is on the wholemore favourable than we expected.   He appreciates the necessityfor precautionary measures against an armed attack, though hethinks one unlikely.   Should this occur, however, he promisesthat he and his colleagues will examine the ^situation^^fl sympathetically.   Meanwhile he strongly endorses the policyof &quot;giving no offence to the new Chinese Gowrnment&quot;.Moreover, the upsurge of nationalism throughout South-East Asiacannot be ignored, and Pandit Nehru trusts that the futureof Hong Kong will be viewed by the United Kingdom Governmentin the same spirit of imaginative statesmanship that theyhave shov/n in dealing with problems elsewhere in Asia. Froma conversation which the High Commissioner has had with theSecretary of the Indian Department of External Affairs, it isclear that (in view of the position of the French andPortuguese territories in India) the Indian Government wouldhave to reserve liberty of action if the Chinese Communists,instead of taking offensive action, decided to place a demandfor the cession of Hong Kong before the Security Council.Sir Archibald Nye reports; moreover, that in view  &gt;f theprobable attitude of thg Indian press and public, the lesspublicity v/hich can be given to the matter the better, sinceFandit Nehru and Sir Girja Bajpai would find it difficult inpublic to maintain as friendly an attitude towards the problemas they are able to do in private.(f) Pakistan.     Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan has assured theHigh Commissioner that the United Kingdom Government&apos;s policyin regard to Hong Kong has his complete personal sympathy^-and that he can see no reason to fear that the Pakistan:Government would say or do anything embarrasses...* &quot; the UnitedKingdom.   He emphasised the strength of the lUfted Kingdom&apos;sposition under the charter.I . H
11   - I 141 I(g)   Ceylon*     Mr* Senanayake welcomes the determination II of the United Kingdom Government to make Hong Kong a &quot;bastion II against Communist aggression*   He hopes, however, that we shall II exercise great restraint in dealing with internal unrest in IIHong Kong, since it would be embarrassing for his Government III to support what might seem repressive measures carried out by II I ^ a Colonial l?ower .   Subject to this, however, he has undertaken^^|)|V to make such public expression of support ;:as is possible at |^^|I the appropriate moment in the light of future developments51. I5* The results of our approach to the otherI Commonwealth countries about Hong Kong are, thus, broadlyas &apos;follows:-(i)   We have secured a large measure of support forour policy of taking the precautionary measures required toI strengthen Hong Kong against internal disturbance or possiblearmed attack, while on the other hand carefully refrainingfrom striking a provocative attitude*   Some doubt has beenexpressed whether the Chinese Communists will wish to launcha major attack on Hong Kong at all*(ii)   Provided that our present policy is maintained,we have good grounds for hoping that no statements will bemade by spokesmen for other Commonwealth countries which mightembarrass the United Kingdom Government in their handling ofthe Hong Kong situation*   The Hew Zealand and South AfricanGovernments would be willing to express their moral supportfor as in public if it becomes expedient to ask them to doso and, in favourable circumstances, other Governmentsmight also be willing to do so,I (iix)   The Now Zealand Cabinet have already agreed to makethree (or possibly four) frigates available,  if the need shouldarise;   and other ways in which New Zealand might assist areI ? being explored*   After consulting the Australian Cabinet,Mr* Chifley has made it clear that Australia is not preparedto offer land forces, warships or aircraft, though it ispossible that some assistance may be forthcoming in respectof volunteer medical personnel*(iv)   But while there is general support among Common-wealth countries for our policy of taking the precautionarymeasures required to resist aggression, it is clear that(there is a wide measure of concern at some of the longerterm aspects of the problem*   These may be considered underthe two heads of: -;   (a)   future policy towards Chinaj(b)    the &quot;Colonial11 aspect*(a)   Future policy towards China*     In the discussionsv/hich took place with Mr* St* Laurent, the Canadian Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs made, the point thatI the Chinese Communists had so far been behaving well; thatwe should be establishing relations -with thera;    and thatI evidence was lacking that Conanunisin in China was the same- asthe Russian brand*   Mr* St* Laurent himself also emphasisedI that the Canadian Cabinet would wish to form an opinion Iespecially from the angle of how things would shape in theSecurity Council in the event of a clash*   The attitude ofthe Prime Minister of Australia has been described above*In effect, he considers that the main endeavour to secureII* I
I 142 Ithe future of Hong Kong should be &quot;by positive means, based..on relations between the seemingly new Government and theWestern countries&quot;;   and that we should enter at once intodirect negotiation with the Chinese Communist authorities, witha view to reaching a clear understanding with them about HongKong&apos;s future.   Pandit Nehru, while admitting that aggressionmust, of course, be resisted, suggests that :ipolicies may be)   0 so framed as to avoid the possibility of such a situationarising&quot;.   He personally doubts whether the ChineseCouimunists would wish to take action that v/ould mean war witha great power, and foresees many developments in the nexttwo or throe months which will progressively change theinternal and external situation of China.(b)   The &quot;Colonial&quot; aspect..     But more important is thereaction of Commonwealth countries to what may be termed the&quot;Colonial&apos;- aspect of the problem.   As will be seen from thefirst reactions of Mr. St. Laurent, this clearly weighs heavilywith the Canadian Prime Minister, though we should hope to be^^fl able to shake him out of some of his misconceptions.   It wasonly to be expected that, in viev/ of their repeated pronounce-ments against &quot;Colonialism&quot;, the three &quot;new&quot; Members of theCommonwealth should feel some hesitation on this score ingiving full support for our policy;    on the whole, however, ?their replies are realistic, and are quite as satisfactory aswe could have expected.   Nevertheless, any announcements aboutour long term policy for Hong Kong will need careful handlingfrom this point of view.   Pandit Nehru has himself raised thepoint,  and has made it clear that he expects the UnitedKingdom Government to follow a no less enlightened policyin relation to Hong Kong than that already adopted in regardto India, Burma and Ceylon.   Moreover, as regards immediateaction, the Prime Minister of Ceylon has warned us that his fl^fl^^fl present attitude of warm support for our policy might provedifficult to sustain if there were to be any mishandling ofwhat might appear to be internal unrest, &quot;since the relation-ship of a Colony to any metropolitan power is repugnant tothe sentiments of Asiatic peoples&quot;.   I suggest that thispoint needs careful watching, and that the Secretary of statefor the Colonies may wish to bear it in mind in any _instructions&apos; sent to the Governor on measures to deal withlocal unrest.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.I.,17th June, 1949.m * I
