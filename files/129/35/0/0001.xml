THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1949Copy No. 31CABINETTHE IEISH republic memorandum by the Prime MinisterNow that the Ireland Bill has passed the House of Commons, I should beglad if Ministers would take steps to ensure that their Departments clearlyunderstand the basis of Government policy in respect of the new Irish republic and keep its implications in mind in the course of their day-to-day administration.2. From 18th April, 1949, the Irish Republic ceased to be a member of theCommonwealth. She will therefore be excluded from the established system of commonwealth consultation, and will no longer be entitled to receive information or assistance which is given as a matter of course to Commonwealth countries.It follows that she cannot be a member of any Commonwealth Committee, and she has already withdrawn from the two such Committees on which she was represented (the Commonwealth Liaison Committee for the European recovery programme and the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux); Departments con-trolling the business of any other bodies of this kind should consult the Common-wealth Relations Office if at any time the Government of the Irish Republicshould seek to send representatives to their meetings or to obtain any special facilities or information from them. From the point of view of preserving ttespecial privileges of other Commonwealth countries, it is important that: theIrish Republic should not appear to be retaining any of these benefits of Common-wealth membership.Departments need not withhold from the Irish Republic scientific informa-tion which would normally be made available to a friendly foreign country.  Theadvice of the Ministry of Defence should, however, be obtained before communi-cating to the Irish Republic information about defence research.37040SEGRETCP. (49) 11118^ May, 1949
3. Although the Irish Republic has left the Commonwealth and renouncedallegiance to the Crown, the Governments of the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries have recognised that, in view of the bonds of history andblood between those countries and the people of Southern Ireland, it would be inap-propriate that they should treat the Irish Republic as a foreign State or its citizensas Jforeigners. The Ireland Bill accordingly provides that references in earlierstatutes to His Majesty&apos;s dominions shall, if they hitherto extended to Eire, be interpreted in future as though they included the Irish Republic. And theBill also reaffirms section 3 (2) of the British Nationality Act, 1948, which hasthe effect that Eire citizens who are not also British subjects are treated in thiscountry as though they were British subjects.The Bill has the effect that, in all Acts of Parliament and subordinate legis-lation enacted up to 31st December, 1949, references to His Majesty&apos;s dominions,to British ships or aircraft, or to British subjects will automatically includereferences to the Irish Republ^. and to its ships, aircraft or citizens. There-after, in all new legislation anu subordinate legislation it will have to be madeexplicitly clear whether or not the legislation includes references to the irish republic or to its citizens. Separate instructions will in due course be issued tothe legal branches of all Departments regarding the terminology to be used forthis purpose in subordinate legislation.4. As part of this policy by which the United Kingdom and the irish republic do not regard one another as foreign countries, the existing tradepreferences between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic will be continued on a reciprocal basis.Supply Departments which charge higher rates for supplies and services rendered to foreign Governments than are charged to Commonwealth Govern-ments should accord to the Irish Republic any preferential rates which theyaccord to Commonwealth countries.5. The Ireland Bill formally recognises the title &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;as the name attributed to Southern Ireland by the law there in force. There willbe occasions on which Departments will find it impossible to avoid using the term&quot;Republic of Ireland &quot;-for example in joint declarations made on behalf ofthe two Governments, in Avhich the Dublin authorities will insist on the use ofthat term. On such occasions as these, where it would be embarrassing to take any other course, the formal description may be used. It is, however, open to criticism as a description of a part of Ireland; and its frequent use by WhitehallDepartments would give offence in Northern Ireland. It is therefore important that Departments should use, wherever possible, the alternative description&quot;Irish Republic.&quot;The term &quot; Ireland &quot; should never be used in official documents or cofre-spondence in relation to the South: it should be reserved for use where a reference to the island as a whole is intended. Similarly, the adjective &quot; Irish &quot;should not normally be used except in relation to the island as a whole; &quot;irish republican &quot; or &quot;of the Irish Republic &quot; should be used (e.g. Irish Republicanships, Army of the Irish Republic, people of the Irish Republic). But, since this
phraseology (particularly if often repeated) may be clumsy at times, it will be permissible on occasion to use the term &quot; Irish,&apos;5 if the context makes it clearthat the reference is exclusively to the Irish Republic. In draft agreements,,for example, it should be possible to include an interpretation clause early in theAgreement denning &quot; Irish &quot; as meaning &quot; of the Irish Republic.&quot;United Kingdom delegates at International Conferences should be.instructedspecially to avoid referring to &quot; Ireland &quot; when references to the Irish Republicare intended, to make it clear that they represent His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and to use the fulltitle of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in any formaldocument.The use of the term &quot; Eire &apos;&apos; should be discontinued. As a geographicaldescription of the South, &quot; Southern Ireland &quot; may be used as an alternative to&quot; the Irish Republic.&quot;6. The Commonwealth Relations Office will continue to be responsible forlandling the relations between the United Kingdom Government and thejrovernment of the Irish Republic.. C.   R.  A.   &apos;10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,18th May, 1949.
