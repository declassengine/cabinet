S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1, ......25th May, 1949ECONOMIC REPORT: I.-Man-PowerDespite a further fall of 30,000 in the total working population during March,the number in civil employment recovered to the same level as in January. Thiswas made possible by a reduction of 10,000 in the Armed Forces and of another10,000 in the number of men and women on release leave and by a fall in thenumbers unemployed in March.. 2. Total man-power in the manufacturing industries declined slightly inMarch. A reduction of 6,000 brought the number employed in metals, engineering and yehictes down to the same level,as.at the end of December 1948. There wasa gain of 3,000 persons during March in the clothing industry but no.change intextiles. There has been no significant change during the first quarter of this year in total employment in building and contracting or in distribution. The rise of ,000 during March in professional, financial and miscellaneous services brought the number employed back to the end-1948 level.3. The number of persons registered as unemployed declined from March to april from 340,400 at 14th March to 324,900 at 11th April when the rate was equivalent to about 1 - 6 per cent, of the total number of employees insured underthe national insurance schemes. The fall in unemployment was confined, for bothmales and females, to those wholly unemployed for more than two weeks. The risein the number of persons wholly unemployed for less than two weeks was due mainly to school-leavers.4. The more detailed quarterly analysis prepared by the Ministry of Labourshows that of.the total of 242,061 wholly unemployed males at 14th March, 1949,33 per cent, had been unemployed for not more than four weeks and 15 per cent,had been unemployed for more than a year. 44 per cent, of the females had beenunemployed for not more than four weeks and 4 per cent, for more than a year.58 per cent, of the males and 71 per cent, of the females, who were wholly un-employed at 6th December, 1948, had found work or ceased to register by the middleof March.Copy No.37042b
II.-Production .5. Since the middle of 1948 the index of total industrial production has been maintained at about 6^ points (or 5^ per cent.) above the level of the correspondingmonths a year earlier. The index rose in February to 131 compared with 123 inFebruary 1948. For the manufacturing industries the index rose to 133 inFebruary. The index for chemicals and allied.trades rose to 133 in February; 10 points greater than in February 1948. The index for textiles and clothingincreased to 136 6 points above the level attained in October and November. Theindex of total industrial production in March is provisionally estimated at 130compared with 119 in March 1948 which was affected by the Easter holiday.Interim, Index of Industrial Production_(Average 1946 ^ 100)	All industries			Manufacturing industries					Points			Points	1947-48	1948-49	increase	1947-48	1948-49	increase3rd Quarter......	109	115	4-7	110	118	4-8October	120	126	+6	122	128	+6November	123	129	4-6	123	131	-f8December    and						January	117	123		117	125	:-f8 &apos;February	123	131	4-8	124	133	. .-f9March	119	130	+ U	121	133	4-12Coal6. The output of deep-mined coal recovered after the Easter holiday to4-07 million tons in the last week of April. Average weekly output in Marchand April was 4 per cent, greater than in the same period of 1948. In the first two weeks of May average weekly output declined to 3,782,000 tons. An averageof 183,000 tons a week was lost through disputes. In the third week of May,output recovered to 4,087,000 tons.Output of Deep-mined Coal(Weekly averages)_	1947-48 Th. tons	1948-49 Th. tons	Change : Per cent.November       .........	4,000	4,094	, 4-2-4 m.December and January	3,760	3,864	4-2-8February       ...       ......	3,915	4,092	4-4-5March and April       ......	3,775	3,927	+4-07. Compared with a year ago there has been no increase in the number ofworkers effectively employed at the coal face.

Textiles &apos; &apos;8. Cotton. The output of cotton yarn rose steadily from 18-91 million lb.in the second week of March to 19-71 million lb. in the second week of April.After the Easter holiday production increased further to 20-14 million lb. inthe first week of May. Total production for the first four months of this yearamounted to 320-4 million lb. or 2-7 per cent, less than the target for the period.Output of woven cotton and rayon fabrics faijed to rise in March and total production for the quarter fell slightly behind the target.9. Wool. Deliveries of worsted yarn and of woven cloth fabrics during thefirst quarter of 1949 just exceeded the targets.10. Rayon. A record output of 24-8 million lb. of rayon yarn and staplefibre was achieved in March 16 per cent, more than in January and twice as great as in 1937.   The target for 1949 is 300 million lb.Iron and Steel11. The output of steel ingots and castings for the first four months of theyear was equal to the target and about 6 per cent, greater than output in thecorresponding period of last year. Average weekly production of pig-iron in Marcha.nd April was 179,000 tons a week compared with an average of 180,000 tons aweek in March and April of 1948. Stocks of pig-iron have fallen from 479,000 tonsin October to 434,000 tons at the end of April, but are forecast to recover to aboutthe October level by the end of June. Stocks of scrap have been falling slowlysince the beginning of the year but rose to 495,000 tons in the first week of May.Motor Vehicles12. The output of passenger cars rose to a new high level of 7,535 a week in March and the record number of 5,288 a week was produced for export. Theincrease was confined to small cars up to 1,600 c.c, 75 per cent, of those produced in March being for the export market. Production for export of both medium and large cars was lower in March than in February. In April the number of passenger cars produced for export declined reflecting to some extent difficultiesin export markets.13. The value of exports of passenger cars to Canada recovered to  459,000in March-equal to the average of  460,000 a month achieved in the last quarterof 1948. Exports to the United States, however, fell further from the monthly average of  634,000 to which they had risen in the last quarter of 1948 to  82,000in April.Export of all Passenger Cars (including chassis)(Monthly averages)  thousand	Total to all	To	To	countries	United States	Canada1948 1st Quarter......      ....	.....    4,575    .	286	522nd Quarter...	5,582	360	2513rd Quarter...      ...      ...	4,697	593	4334th Quarter......	5,233	634	4601949 January      ...      .....	5,325	325	306February	4,543	186	386March        ..........	6,134	103	453April............	5,272	82	45914. Production of commercial vehicles also reached a record level of 4,139a week in March. The number produced for export rose to 2,129 a week, of which1,092 were vehicles of under 15 cwt. In April production for export declined toan average of 1,778 a week.III.-Building15. The number of new permanent houses (excluding aluminium houses)completed rose to 19,338 in March.  Construction was begun on 18,280 new houses37042 b 2 -
so that^the number under construction fell by 1,058 to 185,533 a reduction of46,057 since March 1948. Building activity in April was affected by the Easterholiday.IY.-External Trade16. Exports rose in March to a new record of  160 million, estimated at162 per cent, of the volume in 1938. In April, however, they dropped sharplyto  137 million or 140 per cent, of the volume in 1938, Even when allowance ismade for the different number of working days in the month the rate of exportappears to have been below that in March; but it is too early yet to say whetherthis represents a significant check to the rising trend of exports. Exports of metal goods were  10-1 million less, and textiles  5-5 million less than in March.Imports, on the other hand, fell only by  2 million to  188 million and thevisible adverse balance of trade (exports and re-exports (f .o.b.) less imports (c.i.f;))almost doubled to  45 million in March.17. There has been no further improvement in the value of our exports tothe United States since the beginning of 1948. Exports to Canada and New-foundland rose to a record level of  8 - 2 million in March, but the average for thefirst quarter of 1949 was no greater than the average of the last quarter of 1948.British Exports to the Western Hemisphere(Monthly averages)		Total to Western Hemisphere	To United States	To Canada and New-foundland	Per cent, of total U.K. exports							To Western Hemisphere	To United States	To Canada and New-foundland		  million					1938		6-9	1-7	2-0	17-7	4-4	5 01947	...	14-9	4-0	3-7	15-7	4-2	3-91S48	1st  Quarter	20-5	5-8	5-1	17-4	4-9	4-4	2nd Quarter	20-3	5 1	5-8	15-6	3-9	4-5	3rd Quarter	21-8	5-7	6-2	16-1	4-2	4-6	4th Quarter	25-5	5-6	6-9	17-6	3-9	4-71949	January	26-5	5-9	5-8	16-7	3-7	3-6	February ...	21-8	4-5	5-9	15-5	3-2	4-2	March	25-5	5-4	8-2	16 0	3-4	5-1Y. Balance of Payments18. The gold and dollar deficit in March showed a heavy increase (as was expected) over the relatively low figures for January and February, and resultedin a deficit of  82 million in the first quarter of the year. The increase was brought about by the high net expenditure of both the United Kingdom and theRest of the Sterling Area, particularly in the United States. Colonial receiptsshowed a small net decrease, comprising a substantial fall in Malaya partiallyoffset by a rise in British West Africa. Payments to third countries were morethan twice those made in February (but slightly lower than the January figure)largely because Egypt drew $ 10 million (half her year&apos;s ration). The sterling-area deficit with Switzerland increased, causing a higher settlement of $6 million;the April settlement (in respect of March) was $ 7 million, and the loss of goldis expected to continue at approximately this level for some months. The settle-ments with Belgium in respect of February and March were $5 million and$9 million respectively. The gold and dollar deficit in April was again high, at 37 million.19. E.C.A. reimbursements during March were higher, and included a largeitem for machinery deliveries in 1948. Letter of Commitment purchases increased,and the United Kingdom started to use the new E.C.A. cheque system to obtaincertain commodities.   Cash and non-cash receipts under E.R.P. by the United
Kingdom and the Irish Republic during the first three months of 1949 were asshown in the table below : E.R.P.

There were further drawings by India of $8 million on the international monetary Fund, by the United Kingdom of f 10 million on the Canadian Credit,and increased receipts under the South African Gold Loan Agreement. But eventhese resources, coupled with the increased E.R.P. receipts, failed to prevent a reversal of the upward trend in reserves which started last November. Thereduction in the total United Kingdom gold and dollar holdings was  3 million during the month of March, and a further substantial reduction of  11 milliontook place in April.21. Sterling liabilities in respect of the rest of the sterling area fell by 10^ million in March, but this was more than offset by a rise of  11  million in respect of the non-sterling area. March was the second month in successionwhich had shown no significant change in the level of total sterling liabilities.India&apos;s sterling fell by  41 million, but South Africa&apos;s holdings reinforced bysterling drawings on the Gold Loan showed only a moderate drop. Gold loandrawings by 24th May amounted to  35 million out of the total of  80 million.VI. Stocks -22. In judging how much our balance of payments has improved duringthe last 18 months it is important to know whether or not we have been replacingour stocks of imported or mainly imported commodities, that is, whether theimprovement in our balance of payments has been made possible by &quot; disinvest-ing &quot; in stocks or whether we have been able to build them up.23. Figures of total weight in tons of stocks of food, animal feeding-stuffs,raw materials and petroleum products are not a reliable guide for this purpose,since any change measured in tons may be the net result of increases in stocks of commodities having a relatively low price per ton and reductions in stocks of other commodities costing much more per ton.24. Table 12 in the Appendix gives for the first time a measure of changesin the volume of stocks since the end of 1947, computed by valuing stocks of eachcommodity at constant f.o.b. prices. The table shows that the volume of total stocks of food and animal feeding-stuffs (excluding stocks on farms), stocks of rawmaterials (excluding stocks of pig-iron and steel which are mainly home produced)and stocks of petroleum products, was only very slightly lower at the end of 1948than at the end of 1947. Small movements of this magnitude in the index during1948 cannot be regarded as very significant owing to the changes in the relativeprices of commodities during the year. The index of stocks of food and animal feeding-stuffs fell by 2 per cent., though this was not significant. Stocks of rawmaterials declined by 7 per cent., due almost entirely to a 20 per cent, fall in stocks of textile materials.   Stocks of petroleum products rose by 44 per cent.
25. Preliminary figures for 1949 show that the index of the volume of total stocks (December 1947 = 100) declined further to 93 at the end of March 1949compared with 95 at March 1948. This fall in the first quarter of 1949 reflectsmainly the seasonal fall in stocks of food and feeding-stuffs and raw materials.The index is forecast to rise to 96 at the end of June, when it will be two pointsabove the level at June 1948Index of Volume of Stocks in the United Kingdom(December 1947     100)		Food and	Raw	PetroleumEnd of month	Total	feeding-stuffs	materials	products1946 December	101	95	100	1691947 December	100	100	100	1001948 March   ...	95	96	95	92June	94	91	95	114September	96	94	95	133December	97	98	93	1441949 January ......	96	98	91	139February	95	.   96	90	150March	93	93	87	161Forecast				April	93	92	88	167May      ......	95	96	89	166June	96	96	91	16226. In interpreting these figures of changes in the value of stocks it shouldbe remembered that they relate to total stocks held by importers, wholesalers and manufacturers; they do not include retail stocks or work in progress, both ofwhich almost certainly rose in volume during 1948.YIL- prices import and Export Prices27. The index of export prices (1947 = 100) which declined from 113 inJanuary to 112 in February was unchanged in March. The index of import prices has been constant at 118 since January. Since March 1948 the terms oftrade have deteriorated by about 4 per cent.Retail Prices28. The interim index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100) was unchangedin March at 109 compared with 106 at March 1948. The index has now beenconstant at 109 since last November. The index of food prices declined by one point to 108 in March compared with 109 in March 1948. The trend of clothingprices continues to rise though less rapidly than in 1948.Wholesale Prices29. After remaining almost unchanged since May 1948, the Board of Tradersindex of wholesale prices (1938 = 100) rose sharply by 2-7 per cent, in Aprilfrom 217 to 223 the biggest increase since January 1948. This rise was duealmost entirely to the limitation or removal of subsidies. The index of cerealprices rose by 12 per cent, owing to increases in the maximum prices of animal feeding-stuffs. The index of iron and steel prices rose by about 9 per cent, afterthe removal of the subsidies on imported ore, scrap and pig-iron. This was partly offset by reductions in the prices of cotton, wool,, lead and zinc and theindex of industrial materials and manufactures increased by 1 - 8 per cent. Englishprices of copper, lead and zinc, which lagged behind American prices when theywere rising in 1948, are now higher than the American prices.
Prices in the United States30. Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices (31st December, 1931 = 100)fell further from 355 on 12th April to 344 on 13th May. Wholesale prices of farm products have remained fairly stable since February, but non-ferrous metalsprices have fallen heavily. The price of lead declined from 21-5 cents a lb. inFebruary to 14-0 cents a lb. on 6th May; the price of zinc from 17-5 cents a lb.in February to 12-0 cents a lb. on 9th May, and the price of copper from23-5 cents a lb. in March to 18-0 cents a, lb. on 9th May.VIII. Wages and Earnings31. The. latest Earnings Enquiry of the Ministry of Labour shows thatthe average weekly earnings (including bonus, overtime, &amp;c.) of adult men in theindustries covered by the Enquiry rose in October 1948 to 137s. lid., or 100 percent, greater than in October 1938. The rise in average weekly earnings of menbetween October 1947 and October 1948 amounted to 9*. 10d., compared with arise of 7s. 4d. between October 1946 and October 1947, and was not much belowthe rate of increase each year between July 1940 and July 1943. Women also received bigger increases in weekly earnings last year.. Changes in Average Weekly Earnings in Manufacturing and Certain OtherIndustries			Men s.   d.

Between April 1947 and October 1948 average weekly earnings of all workers covered by the enquiry rose by 13 per cent. About one-half of this increase was due to a rise in rates of wages for a normal working week. Average hoursof work (including overtime) increased by less than 1 per cent, during this period.33. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)was unchanged in April at 108 for the fourth successive month.34. Increases in wage rates which became effective in March and Apriladded approximately  220,600 to the weekly wage bill of about 1,281,000 workers.The main increases were in agriculture and amounted to an addition of about 127,000 to the weekly wages of 757,000 workers.35. A feature of some recent claims is the demand for extra holidays with pay. The claims for an extra week&apos;s holiday with pay in the coalmining and electric cable-making industries have been rejected. Paid holidays have been extended from one to two weeks in the flour milling trade and in the clothing and allied trades. The unions in the engineering and shipbuilding industries havelodged claims for an additional week&apos;s holiday with pay and similar claims havebeen made in the cement industry and in the retail drapery, outfitting and foot-wear trades.36. The National Union of Railwaymen has now submitted new claims forIds. Od. per week increase and payment of time and a quarter for Saturdayafternoon rate. The previous claim for 12s. 6d. a week increase was rejected onarbitration.IX.-European Recovery ProgrammeElections37. The annual elections for the Council and Executive Committee of theOrganisation took place on 13th April. The Council (of which all participating countries are members) re-elected Belgium to the Chairmanship.    The Irish
Republic and Austria were elected to the First and Second Vice-Chairmanshipsrespectively. The United Kingdom was re-elected to the Chairmanship of theExecutive Committee, with France in the Vice-Chairmanship of the ExecutiveCommittee. The other countries elected to the Executive Committee were Italy,the Netherlands, Greece, Norway, and Portugal. Switzerland, Sweden and turkey ceased to be members.Congressional Hearings38. The Authorisation Act has now been passed by Congress. Neither thefigure of $1,150 million for the April-June quarter nor the figure of $4,280million for the year July 1949-June 1950, were cut during the passage of theBill, although the $150 million for long-term projects was deleted, TheAuthorisation Act, has, however, to be followed by the Appropriation Act andin the Administration^ submission to the Appropriations Committee the totalof $5,430 million has been cut to $5,272 million &quot;because of price declines.&quot;Present indications are that this figure will probably be further reduced duringthe passage of the Appropriations Act.Division of A id for 1949-5039. Directions for the preparation of revised programmes for the year1949-50 have been agreed at O.E.E.C., and the revised programmes are due to besubmitted by participating countries on 25th May.United Kingdom Allotment of Aid for 1948-4940.
