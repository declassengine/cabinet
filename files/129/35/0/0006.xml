May 1949CABINETREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCENote by the Chancellor of the exchequer in the absence of the President of the Board of Trade, I circulate herewith,for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum by the parliamentary secretary, Board of Trade, on the report of the Committee on Resale price maintenance.The recommendations in this memorandum were discussed with the Presidentbefore he left for Canada, and they have my support.\ R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,19th May, 1949.SECRET Copy No.     31CP. (49) 11619th May, 1949ANNEX .REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESALE PRICE maintenance memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Trade   &apos;1. Following a decision by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (47) 8thMeeting, Minute 2), the President of the Board of Trade appointed a Committeeto enquire into resale price maintenance. This practice is used by manufacturers and trade associations to ensure that, whatever the channels of distributionthrough which a particular article has passed, it shall be sold to the retail customerat a price which has been fixed in advance by the producer. The committee&apos;terms of reference are at Appendix A.2. The Committee has now reported and the report is to be published as a command paper on or about 2nd June. The main conclusions and recommenda-tions in the report are at Appendix B.3. The report, which is unanimous (with one qualifying note referred to inparagraph 6 of this paper), does not condemn all forms of resale price main-tenance outright. It finds that resale price maintenance, if operated reasonablyand flexibly by individual manufacturers, has certain substantial advantages forproducers, distributors and consumers alike; it is useful as an aid to the eon-tihuous flow of planned production and as a means of preventing drastic anduneconomic price-cutting, in particular the use of the so-called &quot;loss-leader&quot;technique by which retailers slash the price of some popular and well-advertisedbrand of goods (often to less than wholesale price) as a bait to attract customersfor the other goods they are offering for sale.4. The Committee&apos;s first recommendation, therefore, is that no action shouldbe taken which would deprive an individual producer of the power to prescribeand enforce resale prices for goods bearing his brand, provided that this power is not used to obstruct the development of particular methods of trading, to impede37054 b
the distribution by another manufacturer of competitive goods, or to deprive the public of improvements in. distribution. The Committee go on to recom-mend that the appropriate Government Departments should invite consultations with the principal national organisations in trade and industry to consider themost satisfactory means of ensuring that resale price maintenance is administeredin such&apos;a way as to maintain an adequate distribution of goods and at the sametime to provide for such price reductions as are justified by low cost distributionor by a regular policy of distributing surplus profit to the customer&apos;; ,&apos;: ;5. The Committee&apos;s second main recommendation deals with collectiveaction taken by trade associations to enforce resale price maintenance. Themethods used by trade associations are described in the body of the report; they include fines, loss of privileges, special discounts for retailers who buy only from members of the association and, in particular, &quot; common stop-lists,&quot; by the useof which a distributor who cuts the price of one price-maintained article auto-matically loses his supplies of all the products of all the association members.The Committee see no justification for these collective measures, which in theiropinion have impeded the development of economical methods of trading andprevented the reduction of distributive costs and prices. They recommend, there-fore, that steps be taken to render illegal the application of sanctions whichextend beyond the remedies open to an individual producer for any breach ofresale price maintenance conditions. 16. We consider that the broad principle of these conclusions should be strongly endorsed by the Government Their implementation is essential tothe free growth of new and.more economic methods and should make a realcontribution to the reduction of distributive costs over a large field of consumer goods. It is true that there are arguments for abolishing resale price maintenancealtogether, as indicated in Mr. Henry Smith&apos;s qualifying note to the report(reproduced as Appendix C). There is insufficient evidence, however, to showthat resale price maintenance, if reasonably administered by an independentmanufacturer, has enough harm in it to justify its abolition. The possibilityof complete abolition should not be ruled out, but it is fairly certain that anyattempt at the present time to overthrow completely a system which undoubtedlyhas certain advantages and which is so deeply, rooted in the present distributivestructure would do more harm than good.7. There is reason to believe that the publication of the evidence containedin the report, and a firm indication of the Government&apos;s intentions will, in them-selves, have a salutary effect and will lead at the very least to a halt being called to the development of new collective resale price maintenance associations. Thereis a good chance that discussions of the kind recommended by the CommitteeWill produce substantial results. The purpose of these discussions, to which, inconsultation with the Minister of Food, the President of the Board of Tradeproposes to invite representatives of the Federation of British Industries, NationalUnion of Manufacturers, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, theCo-operative Movement, and other national organisations concerned, will be toensure that resale price maintenance by individual manufacturers is reasonablyand flexibly operated, and that it is limited to its proper functions, in particular the prevention of &quot;loss-leader&quot; selling. It will be made clear from the startthat if resale price maintenance is to be allowed to continue at all, discrimination against Co-operative Societies must cease, and the public must be allowed toreap the benefit of new techniques of low-cost distribution, especially self-servicemethods, by way of lower retail prices. These discussions will it is hoped resultin agreement on a code of behaviour for individual manufacturers who wish tomaintain resale prices for their branded goods.8. It is too much to hope that persuasion and education can be fully effective in abolishing collective resale price maintenance, but the nature of the action required for this purpose will depend to some extent on the success of the dis-cussions referred to above. At some point we must expect to have to employstatutory means to deal with collective resale price maintenance, and these might take the form of either (a) An order under Defence Regulations such as that set out in L.P. (46) 232,and approved at a meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on.27th September, 1946 (L.P. (46) 31st Meeting, Minute 3) prohibitingdiscrimination against Co-operative Societies.
This method would not be suitable for dealing with the whole&quot;gamut of collective resale price maintenance activities and there are,in any case, obvious political objections to using Defence Regulationsat this time as a weapon of industrial policy.(b) References to the Monopolies Commission.Three cases (electric lamps, builders&apos; castings and dental goods)in which collective resale price maintenance agreements play a sub-stantial part are already under investigation by the Commission, and inview of the Commission^ heavy programme of work, we propose to await their first reports before referring any new cases. Some other cases where distributive trade associations play a big part (including in particular the Proprietary Articles Trade Association, which is virtually the founder of resale price maintenance associations), should at some point be referred to the Monopolies Commission on accountnot only of their resale price maintenance elements, but also of the many other restrictive practices involved, and action against such bodies following Monopolies Commission reports would doubtless havea salutary effect on other trade associations of a similar kind. Butthis method of dealing with the problem would undoubtedly be slow,since it could only proceed trade by trade, and if industry felt that noother means would be employed it is improbable that they would go far to put things right before references to the Commission were made.(c) Special legislation, which might deal not only with resale price main-tenance but also with other restrictive practices in the distributive trades for example, &quot; loyalty rebates &quot; (by which associations attemptto prevent distributors from handling the products of independentmanufacturers) and &quot; trade lists&quot; (in which restrictive definitions ofwholesalers and retailers who may be supplied by association members are used to restrict entry into the distributive trades).Such legislation, while difficult to frame and fit into the presentlegislative programme, could be introduced early in the lifetime ofthe next Parliament.9. A decision which of these statutory means to use, if and when education and persuasion prove ineffective, need not be taken until we see how the report is,received and what action industry may itself take on it. Moreover, a public declaration of the Governments intention to make collective resale price main-tenance illegal would place the Monopolies Commission in a most invidiousposition. The Commission is at present charged with the task of investigatingcertain industries in which resale price maintenance plays an important part,and they have the statutory duty to report on the effect on the public interest ofthese and other arrangements in the industries concerned. It is perhaps improb-able that their conclusions on the resale price maintenance aspects of theseindividual cases will be any different from those of the Lloyd Jacob Committee,but if the Government were to announce that they had already made up their mindson one of the principal points on which the Commission had been asked to advise,such a course could hardly fail to damage the Commission^ status with industry,while the Government would be open to attack on the grounds that within a year of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act coming on the statute book theywere by-passing the Act&apos;s main instrument. Furthermore, in view of what issaid in &quot; Labour Believes in Britain &quot; (Chapter III, paragraph 6 (&amp;)) about actionto deal with minimum prices in the distributive trades, the next parliament would be the appropriate time for abolishing collective resale price maintenance.10. The President of the Board of Trade feels, therefore, that while theGovernment should welcome the broad principles of the reports recommendations,we should avoid committing ourselves to action to make collective resale price maintenance illegal until after the Monopolies Commission has reported on thecurrent batch of cases in which this practice is of importance. By that time--and the Chairman of the Commission has been asked to give priority to the investi-gations into these cases industry&apos;s reaction to the report will be clear, thediscussions designed to implement the Committee&apos;s first recommendation Will bewell under way, if not already concluded, and it should be very much easier thanit is at present to see exactly how and when the outlawing of collective resale price maintenance should be tackled.37054
11. The President of the Board of Trade proposes, therefore, subject to hiscolleague&apos;s views, to make a statement in the House, immediately after publicationof the report, on the lines of the draft at Appendix D. This makes it clearthat: (a) The Government accept the broad principles of the conclusions andrecommendations of the report.(6) Discussions with the trade organisations concerned will be initiated toensure that in future individual resale price maintenance should onlybe operated reasonably and flexibly, and that in particular discrimina-tion against Co-operative Societies must cease and provisions must bemade for the public to reap the benefit of self-service and other low-cost shops.(c) Industry itself should take heed of the report&apos;s evidence, conclusions andrecommendations on the subject of collective resale price maintenance,but if this process of education and persuasion fails, the Governmentwill take action to ensure that the general public do not suffer fromthe private restriction of price competition.J. E.Board of Trade, Millbank, S.W.1,Uth May, 1949.APPENDIX ATerms of Reference of the Committee on Resale Price Maintenance&quot; to consider the practice by which minimum wholesale and retail prices ormargins for the resale of goods are fixed by producers, and its effects on supply,distribution and consumption, and to report whether in the light of presentconditions, and particularly of the need for the maximum economy and efficiency in the production and distribution of goods, any measures are desirable to prevent or regulate its continuance.&quot;APPENDIX extract from the Committee&apos;s ReportConclusions and Recommendations159. Our enquiry has revealed a conflict between two apparentlycontradictory aims the need on the one hand to encourage the development ofmore economical methods of distribution and the reduction Of retail prices andon the other hand to maintain the quality, continuity or production and readysupply to the public of established British brands.160. We are satisfied that the elimination of price competition over thegreater part of the distributive trades is not consistent with the need for themaximum efficiency and economy in production and distribution so necessary inthe present economic circumstances. Bearing in mind, therefore, the probablecontinued growth of branding and standardisation, we have been concerned to find some solution which would mitigate the harmful effects of resale price maintenance as now in operation and guarantee a substantial degree of flexibility in the distributive structure.161. In arriving at our conclusions we have drawn a distinction betweenthe fixation and maintenance of resale prices by an individual manufacturer andthe collective administration of resale price maintenance schemes. The effectsupon the public interest of these two methods of maintaining prices and theirimpact on the economy are, in our opinion, different.162. We take the view that the manufacturer of a branded article remainsresponsible for the quality of the goods sold under his own brand; he cannot,
therefore, be indifferent to the terms on which his goods are sold to the public.Our evidence has shown that well-known branded articles are particularly liableto be used as loss-leaders by distributors and we are satisfied that their use inthis way has not brought any permanent advantage to manufacturers, distributorsor the shopping public as a whole. Resale price maintenance offers a convenientmeans of protecting brands against misuse by distributors in this or other ways.163; We recommend that no action should be taken which would deprivean individual producer^ of the power to prescribe and enforce resale prices for goods bearing his brand.164. Producers are not, in our opinion, entitled to use resale price main-tenance to obstruct the development of particular methods of trading, to impede the distribution by another manufacturer of competitive goods or to deprive thepublic of the benefits of improvements in distribution. Public policy requiresadequate distribution of goods with provision for such price reductions as are justified by low cost of distribution or by a regular policy of distributing surplusprofit to the customer.165. We recommend that the appropriate Government Departments should invite consultations with the principal national organisations in trade andindustry to consider the most satisfactory means of ensuring that this policy ismade effective.166. We can find no adequate reason to justify a manufacturer either ininterfering with the terms on which the distributor disposes of another manu-facturer&apos;s goods or in surrendering any part of his interest in the resale pricesof goods bearing his brand for this purpose. Collective price maintenance schemesappear to us to have led to the comprehensive regulation of competition in the distributive trades and to have impeded the development of economical methodsof trading and prevented the reduction of distributive costs and prices. Associa-tions of traders designed to bring their collective power to bear to maintain their members&apos; prices are, in our view, undesirable and we note that theCommission set up under the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry andControl) Act, 1948, has already been asked by the Board of Trade to investigatetwo of the industries from which we received evidence.167. We recommend that steps be taken to render illegal the application of sanctions which extend beyond the remedies open to an individual producer forany breach of resale price maintenance conditions.APPENDIX CNote by Mr. Henry Smith -    -1. I support the recommendations adopted by my colleagues, as I considerthat they represent a marked advance from the present position. I cannot,however, without some reservations, accept their interpretation of the evidence given before us, nor admit the whole of the logic by which they reach their conclusions.2. In my opinion the criticism of resale price maintenance which some ofour witnesses presented, and which is set out in 51 to 109, is entirely convincing.Whether enforced by an individual manufacturer or by a trade association, itinevitably leads to retail prices being higher than they would otherwise be in areas and under conditions where distribution costs are low, and to an unnecessaryproliferation of retail outlets. The recommendations of our report, if adopted,will lessen these evils, but will, in my opinion, only remove them if it provesimpossible for resale price maintenance to be operated without the support oftrade associations.3. I am satisfied that the manufacturer of a branded article is interested inhis product being sold to the public on terms which maximise the continuity and stability of production, and that he often believes that this is most easily achieved* We use this word to include manufacturers, wholesalers, growers, importers, &amp;c. (see foot-note (1), page 1). Our recommendations chiefly relate to manufacturers and others who markgoods with their own brand.
by fixing a uniform selling price. The selling price which he chooses is, however,in my opinion, likely to be that which will maximise his profits. I do not meanby this that he will seize upon every opportunity ruthlessly to exploit the public,regardless of the consequence to himself or them, nor that no other considerationswill influence his conduct, but that one may in general expect that self-interest,however enlightened, is likely to provide his dominant motive. The producer ofa branded product enjoys to a certain extent a private market, and can thus choose the price which he will charge, at the expense of losing sales or increasingadvertising costs if he sets a higher rather than a lower price. The fact that wehave not encountered a perfect monopolist engaged in exploiting the public (towhich reference is made in paragraph 115) does not surprise me, nor does it lessen the weight of the argument. Having chosen the retail price most attractive tohim, if the manufacturer is free to maintain it by withholding supplies fromdistributors who do not accept his decision, his opinion is substituted for theimpersonal forces of the market.4. The public are interested in paying no more than the necessary costof distribution, including fair competitive profits to the distributor. As the costs incurred by distributors are not uniform, the public interest is in conflict with that of the manufacturer in uniform prices. But certain aspects of thesetwo interests, that of the manufacturer and of the public, may coincide if theeffect of price competition is to disrupt the continuity of production to such an extent as to increase the cost of production by more than it reduces the cost of distribution. Here I distinguish between ordinary price competition, in whichthe distributor expects a share in his overhead costs to be provided by all sales, andthe use of loss-leaders, of which the name is self-explanatory. If competition of the former kind is in operation, and the basic assumption of a free enterpriseeconomy is that it is normal. I believe that the public interest is served by itsfree play. Competition of the latter type may be against the public interest: bothmay cause embarrassment to the manufacturer. If, however, a distinction isto be drawn between the two, the responsibility should not be left to the manu-facturer, whose interest is not necessarily identical with that of the public.5. I am impressed by the evidence presented by manufacturers to the effectthat the use as &quot; loss-leaders &quot; of branded goods of which the normal retail price- has been widely advertised may break down the continuity of production uponwhich low-cost production largely depends, although I am not convinced that thepractice of selling at uniform retail prices does not contribute to the problem by providing a background against which price-cutting is obvious, and thus strate-gically effective. I cannot, however, accept the implied view of my colleagues thatthe two contradictory aims of reducing distributive costs and maintaining thesupply of branded goods cannot be subjected to comparative evaluation. Theinfluence of resale price maintenance is continuous and actual, while the disturbingeffect of price competition upon the sale of branded goods may only operateoccasionally. This is of particular importance in the circumstances of the presenttime when we are faced with an apparently intractable shortage of labour in the basic industries at the same time that the absorption of labour by distribution is a cause of concern. Moreover, on the evidence presented to us I would hold that theeffect upon the continuity of sales is the same whether price competition be&quot;legitimate,&quot; i.e., reflecting low costs of distribution,, or &quot;strategic,&quot; i.e.,resulting from sales below cost intended to attract custom. Thus to accept inprinciple the right of the manufacturer to determine retail prices is also to denyin principle the usefulness of competition in the distributive trades.6. It is only because I do not think that legislation designed to limit the useof loss-leaders would be easy to frame, or practicable to operate, that I am preparedto support the recommendations of my colleagues that resale price maintenanceshould be allowed to continue in a restricted form. But I consider that the evilconsequences of resale price maintenance in its present form greatly outweigh the evil consequences which might result from an extension of even the most recklessprice competition by distributors.In my view even the power left to the individual manufacturer by theseproposals may prove to be more harmful to the public interest than would be thecomplete restoration of free price competition in the distributive trades.
APPENDIX DDraft Statement in the House of Commons : Resale Price MaintenanceQ: To ask the President of the Board of Trade when the report of theCommittee on Resale Price Maintenance is to be published and whether he hasany statement to make on it.A!.- The report was published to-day and I take this opportunity of thankingthe Chairman, Mr. Lloyd Jacob, K.C., and his colleagues, for their most valuablework.Resale price maintenance is a feature in some of the cases now referred to the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission; its effects in these instancesand its connection with the wider arrangements which the Commission areinvestigating will doubtless be fully considered. It is, however, by its cumulative effect on the national economy rather than by its impact on individual tradesthat a practice so widespread as resale price maintenance must be judged, andit is only by a comprehensive review that industry can itself be guided. this special Committee was therefore set up in advance of the legislation under whichthe Monopolies Commission has now been established.The report, which is unanimous, reaches two main conclusions. First, no action should be taken which would deprive an individual producer of the powerto prescribe and enforce resale prices for goods bearing his brand, provided this power is not used to obstruct the development of particular methods of trading,to impede distribution by another manufacturer of competitive goods, or to deprive the public of improvements in distribution. Secondly, steps should betaken to render illegal the application of sanctions which extend beyond the remedies open to an individual producer for any breach of resale price maintenanceconditions.The Government accept these conclusions in broad principle.I propose, therefore, in consultation with the Minister of Food to adopt theCommittee&apos;s suggestion and invite the principal trade organisations concerned toconsider the most satisfactory means of ensuring that resale price maintenance byan individual producer is exercised in a reasonable manner and is limited to its proper functions. In these discussions I shall make it clear that discriminatoryrestrictions against consumer dividend or discount systems employed by theCo-operative Societies and others must be abolished, and that the public must beallowed to reap the benefit of low-cost methods of distribution (in particular self-service shops) by way of reduced retail prices.The Committee&apos;s second main recommendation, for the abolition of collectiveresale price maintenance, is based on evidence of the existence of a widespreadsystem of trade association controls, whose scope, complexity and cumulativerestrictive effects may surprise even those with long experience in the distributive trades. This evidence should convince manufacturers and traders that their own interests, as well as those of the country, will be best served by freeing distributionfrom the many self-imposed restrictions and controls described in the report.I hope indeed that in the next few months we may see industry organising some&apos;&apos; bonfires &apos;&apos; of its own. I must make clear, however, that, although we have every reason to hope for the co-operation of industry in this matter, the Governmentare fully determined to ensure that the general public shall not suffer from theprivate restrictions of price competition.
