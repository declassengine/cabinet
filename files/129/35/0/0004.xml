Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 31CP. (49) 114ltith May, 1949CABINETTHE HAVANA CHARTER FOR AN INTERNATIONAL TRADEORGANISATIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the question of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ acceptance (i.e., ratification)of the I.T.O. Charter has necessarily remained in abeyance for the past year,pending action by the United States&quot; Government to recommend the Charter toI Congress. President Truman has now, however, sent a Message to Congressi strongly recommending acceptance of the Charter: it is to be expected that,I after hearings in the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees, i.e., probablyI during June or early July, a vote will be taken in Congress on a joint Resolution1 of both Houses authorising the Administration to accept the Charter. A copyI   of the Presidents message is attached (Annex A).I 2.   The time has therefore come for us to consider recommending the Charter* to Parliament, which would, of course, commit the United Kingdom to membership of the I.T.O. On the assumption that the United States accept the Charter (andwe have made it clear that our own acceptance is in any case conditional on theirs)this action on our part is likely to ensure the completion of the project for anInternational Trade Organisation. There is little doubt that the necessary numberof acceptances (eighteen) would be forthcoming from other countries, including some of the other major trading countries. These are likely to include some, ifnot all, the other members of the British Commonwealth. The Australian Govern-ment have already secured Parliamentary approval to acceptance subject only to aceptance by ourselves and the United States, and the Canadian Government areexpected to seek the approval of their Parliament in the near future.3. We have, of course, already gone a very long way towards committing ourselves finally to the I.T.O. project. It will be recalled that the long processof international negotiations which have brought us to the present stage beganwith the bilateral discussions with, the United States in 1945, resulting in thepublication by the United States Government of the &quot; Commercial PolicyProposals&quot; (Cmd. 6709): we associated ourselves with the United States insponsoring these proposals and undertook to endeavour to carry through thenecessary international discussions to a successful conclusion (Annex B, Part 1);and the Prime Minister made a statement to the House of Commons to this effect(Annex B, Part 2). A Preparatory Committee of seventeen nations was set upto consider the proposals : the result of its first session (London, autumn 1946,reported to Ministers in O.E.P. (46) 10, dated 23rd December, 1946) was the prepara-tion of a first draft of the Charter. This was further considered and revisedby the Preparatory Committee at Geneva in 1947; every point in the revised draft was consistent with the decisions of Ministers. At the same time, the countriesbelonging to the Preparatory Committee carried through multilateral tariff negotiations : the results of these are embodied in the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade which, with the approval of Parliament, we are at presentapplying provisionally.   The final stage in the drawing up of the Charter wasI   the World Trade Conference at Havana in 1947-48, in which 62 countries    (virtually the whole world except Russia and some of her satellites) took part.I   Here it was found necessary to make certain concessions to meet the point of1 37047
view of the &quot; under-developed countries,&quot; and the whole situation at the crucialstage of the Conference was reported to the Cabinet in CP. (48) 84 and consideredby them at their meeting on 15th March, 1948. The Cabinet decided (CM. (48)22nd Conclusions, Minute 2) to authorise the United Kingdom Delegate at HavanaI \ to sign the Final Act of the Conference without reservation, and to make clear in his final statement to the Conference the significance of this action, while making clear also that His Majesty&apos;s Government had authorised him to do soon the understanding that they would insist on the administration of certain provisions of the Charter in a manner fully satisfactory to them (Annex B,Part 3). Subsequently, with the approval of my colleagues, I laid the Charterbefore Parliament (Cmd. 7375) and announced that His Majesty&apos;s government intended to recommend the Charter to Parliament in due course if circumstance were then favourable (Annex B, Part 4).4. The qualification &apos;; if circumstances were then favourable &quot; was intended to provide for reconsideration in the event of two contingencies, viz : (a) Grave adverse developments in the balance of payments situation,.e.g.,rejection of E.R.P. by Congress, which would render it impossibleto accept even the very qualified obligations of the Charter relatingto non-discrimination in import and export restrictions, or(b) rejection of the Charter by the United States Administration or Congress.The former of these contingencies has not occurred; the difficulties of our balanceof payments situation, serious as they are, remain of that order of magnitudewhich we have always envisaged as compatible with the rules of the Charter,provided these are reasonably interpreted. (A first test of whether they will infact be reasonably interpreted will be taking place very shortly at Annecy, whenthe question of South Africa&apos;s proposed new import restriction system is discussed by trie Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade : i assume for the purposes of this paper that the outcome of this&quot; test will be satis-factory). Moreover, acceptance of the Charter is now, at long last, likely to carry with it supersession of the non-discrimination clause (Section 9) of &quot;the 1945United Kingdom-United States Financial Agreement; this point is dealt with more fully in paragraph 9 below.5. As regards the acceptance or rejection of the Charter by Congress, the outcome is likely to be in doubt certainly until the Congressional Committees have reported, and possibly until voting on the joint Resolution actually takes place.The balance of informed opinion at present tends to the view that the oddsare fairly strongly, thought not overwhelmingly, in favour of acceptance by congress.6. The time, therefore, is ripe, or nearly ripe, for a final decision by HisMajesty&apos;s Government on recommending the Charter to Parliament. There are thus two questions, viz. : (1) whether or not to do so, and (ii) the timing of action.7. The question of timing is discussed more fully below : the course whichI suggest is that, if we are to recommend the Charter to Parliament, we should put down a Resolution approving the Charter not later than about Whitsun.We have, therefore, about a month in which to decide whether or not to go forward to the completion of the I.T.O. project. 1 would strongly recommend to mycolleagues that we should, in fact, do so. As our previous exhaustive considerationof the details of the Charter has shown, there are so many imponderables asto make it impossible to draw up a hard and fast balance-sheet of the probabledirect losses and gains in trade which we should incur by accepting the Charter;all that can be safely said on this score is that the Charter will probably not affect our trade greatly in the short run (though it is to the I.T.O. project thatwe owe the Geneva tariff bargain, which certainly is to our immediate advantage)and that in the long run we are more likely to gain than to lose from promotingmultilateral international co-operation in the trade sphere. But on the broadplane of general international relations, the arguments for acceptance are strongindeed. It is a remarkable fact that, in these very difficult years, it has beenpossible for nearly 60 nations representing almost the whole non-Communistworld to reach agreement on the text of a Charter which (despite its manyimperfections and compromises) contains real substance and the possibility of creating an I.T.O. with real influence. It is a real encouragement to the peoples of the world to have faith that effective international co-operation is a practicable
possibility and not an unrealisable ideal; and in particular, since it is so largelythe result of a United States initiative, upon its fulfilment depends in no smallmeasure the continued support of the American people for their Governmentsendeavours to strengthen and revitalise the whole free world. If we reject the charter, there will be no I.T.O.; we shall have struck a real blow at the faith ofprogressive opinion throughout the world in international co-operation and placeda potent weapon in the hands of the forces of isolationism in the United States.8. My colleagues will no doubt wish, before taking a decision of considerablemoment on this very complex subject, for an interval of time in which to weighlip in their minds the advantages and disadvantages of acceptance or to examineonce again some of the difficult questions which have arisen during the evolution of the Charter. I suggest, therefore, that the Cabinet might discuss this subject on my return from Canada. (I regret that, owing to the uncertainty of the UnitedStates Governments time-table for the Charter, I have had to circulate this paperjust before my departure; if there are any points on which my colleagues wishfor further information in my absence, the Secretary for Overseas Trade, and appropriate officials of the Board, will, of course, be glad to provide whateveris required.)Section 99. I have referred above to Section 9 of the 1945 Financial Agreement withthe United States. My colleagues will recall that we have for long been-trying to secure agreement with the United States that this will be superseded by the much more flexible non-discrimination rules of the Charter (while avoiding any counter-claim from the United States that we should undertake new obligations,in lieu of those of Section 8 of the Financial Agreement, to achieve convertibilityof sterling by some fixed future date). We have now learned from the UnitedStates Government that they are prepared to meet our wishes. This they proposeto do by announcing unobtrusively during the Charter hearings that it has beenagreed between the United Kingdom and United States Governments that, fromthe date of entry into force of the Charter, Section 9 will be superseded by the charter rules. They hope to secure Congressional acquiescence in this statementwithout discussion, by getting it embodied in the House and Senate Committeereports; we cannot therefore regard the arrangement as secure until Congresshas actually approved the Charter, and meanwhile should minimise any publicityon the subject. If and when it is secured, it should be of considerable value tous. It will enable us to discriminate in favour of soft-currency sources (inparticular the sterling area Commonwealth countries) to whatever extent our balance of payments justifies; this will not greatly affect our balance of payments,since we already have a private understanding with the United States enablingus to discriminate covertly to the extent necessary to secure our essential supplies,but it will remove the risk of this understanding breaking down through fallingprices and political pressures in the United States and, by permitting opendiscrimination, will considerably ease the administrative burden on our import licensing machine.Procedure and Timing10. Assuming that we decide to recommend the Charter to Parliament, it remains to consider the question of procedure and timing. As regards procedure,statutory authority for acceptance of the Charter will not be required, nor willany specific legislation be directly involved. (Legislation may, in my view, be needed at some stage to deal with the point that duties on foreign products cannotbe increased unless a similar increase is made on Commonwealth&apos; goods. But thisis a point which need not be emphasised in a debate on the Charter : it is underseparate consideration in connexion with our general import policy, and I shallbe bringing it up for a decision in that context.) Authority to accept the Chartercould thus be obtained simply by Resolution of both Houses, which might bephrased on the following lines : &quot; That this House approves the proposed acceptance by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, on behalf of the United Kingdom, of the Havana Charter for anInternational Trade Organisation.&quot;Opportunity would, of course, have to be offered for full debate.37047 b 2
11.   As regards timing, there are two separate stages to be considered, viz. : (i) the putting down of the resolution and(ii) the actual debate.It seems desirable that our general aim should be to make our action to acceptthe Charter follow closely on action in the United States, for two reasons.First, from the point of view of our international prestige, we ought to join withthe United States, as we did at the beginning of the I.T.O. project, in giving a clear lead to the rest of the world; secondly, the sooner we act, the sooner will the Charter enter into force by receiving the necessary number (20) of acceptances,and the sooner, therefore, shall we be relieved of our Section 9 obligation. i suggest, therefore, that we aim at securing Parliamentary approval of the Charterbefore the summer adjournment; in this event, the Charter is likely to enter intoforce about the end of the year.12. If we time our action on this basis, and procedure in the United StatesCongress follows the time-table we expect, our Resolution should be put downround about Whitsun, i.e., before Congress has voted on the Charter. This,I suggest, is in fact highly desirable. If Congress subsequently rejects the charter, we shall have lost nothing by having put down our Resolution; in the sphere of international relations, indeed, we shall have gained considerably by placing on the shoulders of Congress the full onus of killing the I.T.O. project,and making it clear that the United Kingdom for its part would have beenready to go forward with this ambitious and far-reaching plan for international co--operation in the economic sphere.13. The actual debate on the Charter in Parliament should not, of course,take place until it is known that the United States will accept the Charter,i.e., probably in July. This will thus leave an interval between the putting down of the Resolution and the debate, during which we could usefully stimulate someinformed public discussion on the underlying issues of the Charter, directed, forexample, to helping public opinion to realise that the limitation of imperial preference which has been so much emphasised in the Press is only one feature of.a document which also contains other notable features which are to be welcomed,e.g., the provisions about international co-operation in the field of full employ-ment policy, and the limitation of quantitative restriction, which hit our exportsso hard before the war and is becoming a more and more serious impediment toour trade in a number of countries.The General A yreement on Tariffs and Trade14. Acceptance of the Charter will place us under the obligation to&quot; accept,&quot; i.e., ratify, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade : we are atpresent applying this provisionally, i.e., with the right to withdraw at sixty days&apos;notice, whereas when we have ratified it we shall be unable to withdraw untilthe end of next year, or possibly (if we accept certain proposals now underdiscussion at the Annecy Conference a point on which I may need to seek theviews of my colleagues shortly) until about three years from now. The GeneralAgreement,&apos; of course, is an integral part of the I.T.O. project, and I suggestthat we might announce our intention&apos; to accept it when opening the Charterdebate, so that the authority of Parliament for accepting it and the Chartercan be obtained simultaneously.H. W.Board of Trade, Millbank, S. W. 1,10th May, 1949.
ANNEX a text of President Truman&apos;s Message to Congress&quot;I submit herewith, for the consideration of the Congress, the Charter foran International Trade Organisation prepared by a conference of the united nations which met in Havana in 1948, together with a memorandum from theSecretary of State. The Charter is designed to do two things : to establish a code of international conduct to guide nations in dealing with the fundamentalproblems of world trade, and to create an agency, within the framework of theUnited Nations, to help implement this code.We have learned through bitter experience how necessary it is for nations to approach jointly the task of improving the conditions of world trade. Duringthe 1930&apos;s many nations acted independently, each attempting to gain advantageat the expense of others. The result was a vicious circle, with restrictions byone nation provoking more serious restrictions by other nations in retaliation.The end result was a tremendous drop in the volume of international trade which made the general depression worse and injured all countries.Since the recent war, though some nations have again acted unilaterally,there has been a general resolve to prevent the vicious circle of restrictions andto achieve progressively freer trade. To gain this objective, action by manynations is necessary. No one nation alone, and no small group of nations can have enough impact on the network of obstructions that has been built up.The United States&apos; programme of reciprocal trade agreements has been ashining beacon of co-operative action to reduce tariff barriers, and it is vitally necessary that the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act be extended in full force.But it is clear that trade agreements alone are not enough. These agreementsdo not touch certain important obstacles to the expansion of trade. Besides,cartels and many other devices have important effects in limiting trade orcreating disadvantages for one country as compared with another. What is needed is co-operative action to attack the whole range of obstacles that standin the way of broadening international trade.The Havana Charter is a major step towards achieving that objective. Itwas agreed upon by the representatives of fifty-four nations after more than two years of preparatory study and negotiation.The Charter establishes an international organisation which is essential tocontinuous and effective international co-operation in the field of trade. Thenations accepting membership in the International Trade Organisation commit themselves to abide by fair and liberal principles of trade. They agree to take no action which may injure another nation without first making genuine effort to reach a constructive solution through consultation, either directly between themselves or through the organisation. They agree to work together continuouslyto achieve progressively greater trade and to settle differences with respect to national policies that affect the flow of international commerce.The Charter is the most comprehensive international economic agreement inhistory. It goes beyomH&quot;ssgiae generalities and deals with the real nature of theproblems confronting us in the present world situation. While it does not includeevery detail desired by this nation&apos;s representatives, it does provide a practical,realistic method for progressive action toward the goal of expanding world trade.The United States can be proud of its leadership in this constructive actionto help the nations of the world work their way out of the morass of restriction and discrimination that has gripped international trade ever since the first world war. The alternative to the Charter is economic conflict and shrinking inter-national trade.This Charter is an integral part of the larger programme of international economic reconstruction and development. The great objectives of the european recovery programme will be only partially realised unless we achieve a vigorousworld trading system. The economic advancement of under-developed areaslikewise depends very largely upon increasing the international exchange of goods and services. Thus, the Charter is an effective step toward the growth of produc-tion and toward the maintenance of employment and economic stability.   It is
fundamental to the progressive, expanding world economy so vital to the increasingwelfare and prosperity of the people of the United States. The great structure of international co-operation that is being erected through the United Nationsmust rest upon a solid foundation of continuous co-operation in economic affairs.The Charter for an International Trade Organisation is a necessary part ofthat foundation, along with the special arrangements that have been made in the fields of money and credit, transportation and communications, food and agriculture, labour and health.As an essential forward step in our foreign policy, I recommend that theCongress authorise the United States to accept membership in the international trade Organisation.&quot;ANNEX BStatements on the CharterThis A annex contains: (1) The joint statement by the United States and the United Kingdom issued at the same time as the United States &quot; Proposals for consideration byan International Conference on Trade and Employment.&quot;(2) An extract from the statement by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons on 6th December,&apos; 1945, regarding the &quot;Proposals&quot;(Cmd. 6709).(3) An extract from the statement by Mr. S.

Joint statement by the United States and the United Kingdom regarding theunderstanding reached on Commercial Policy6th December, 1945.The Secretary of State of the United States has made public to-day a docu-ment setting forth certain &quot; Proposals for consideration by an international conference on Trade and Employment.&quot; These proposals have the endorsement of the Executive branch of the Government of the United States and have beensubmitted to other Governments as a basis for discussion preliminary to the holding of such a conference.Equally, the Government of the United Kingdom is in full agreement on all important points in these proposals and accepts them as a basis for international discussion, and it will, in common with the United States Government, use its best endeavours to bring such discussions to a successful conclusion, in the light of theviews expressed by other countries.The two Governments have also agreed upon the procedures for the inter-national negotiations and implementation of these proposals. To this end theyhave undertaken to begin preliminary negotiations at an early date between themselves and with other countries for the purpose of developing concretearrangements to carry out these proposals, including definitive measures for the relaxation of trade barriers of all kinds.These negotiations will relate to tariffs and preferences, quantitative restric-tions, subsidies, State trading, cartels and other types of trade barriers treated inthe document published by the United States and referred to above. Thenegotiations will proceed in accordance with the principles laid down in that document.
2. Extract from the Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of commons on 6th December, 1945&quot; . . . . The Secretary of State of the United States has made public to-days document setting forth certain &apos; Proposals for consideration by an international conference on Trade and Employment.&apos; These proposals have the endorsement of the Executive branch of the Government of the United States and have beensubmitted to other Governments as a basis for discussion preliminary to the holding of such a conference. Equally, the Government of the United kingdom is in full agreement on all important points in these proposals, and accepts them as a basis for international discussion, and it will, in common with the UnitedStates Government, use its best endeavours to bring such discussions to a successful conclusion in the light of the views expressed by other countries.The two Governments have also agreed upon the procedure for the inter-national negotiations and the implementation of these proposals. To this end,they have undertaken to begin preliminary negotiations at an early date between themselves and with other countries, for the purpose of developing concretearrangements to carry out these proposals, including definitive measures for the relaxation of trade barriers of all kinds. These negotiations will relate to tariffs and preferences, quantitative restrictions, subsidies, State trading, cartels andother types of trade barriers treated in the document published by the UnitedStates and referred to above. The negotiations will proceed in accordance withprinciples laid down in that document3. Extract from the Statement by Mr. S. L. Holmes, Acting Leader of the United-Kingdom Delegation, at the Final Plenary Session of the United nations conference on Trade and Employment at Havana on 23rd March, 1948&quot; .... It will be within the knowledge of many delegations here that theGovernment of the country which I represent have felt it necessary to weigh most carefully the question whether they could autho^-e me to sign this Final Act.As I have explained on other recent occasions, tne signature of an instrument of this sort on behalf of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland is something to which, according to our tradition in these matters, nomean significance attaches. The Government of the United Kingdom much regret that neither in its general balance nor in its detailed provisions is the DraftCharter wholly satisfactory to them.The Government believe that the Charter as now drawn goes too far in the relaxation of control over quantitative restrictions for developmental purposes and that closer control would, in the end, have helped, and not hindered, thecountries at whose insistence these provisions have been redrafted. But still less satisfactory to the Government of the United Kingdom is the final form of thearticle providing for new preferences. We believe the contribution we have made towards general agreement and in fulfilment of the original Proposals from whichthis Charter sprang, by way of limiting and providing for the reduction andeven the elimination of preferences we enjoy, to be a very considerable contribu-tion. Yet at the same time as we are to accept these provisions we have beenasked to accept another provision opening up the prospect of a new range of preferences in the interests of economic development on the accidental basis ofgeography. In accordance with the footnote to the article, however, the Organisa-tion is not bound by a narrow interpretation of region in its study of newpreferences which conform to the purposes and the terms of the article, provided a sufficient degree of economic integration exists between the countries concerned.I.am now in a position formally to withdraw my reservation on this article. ButI must make it clear that the Government of the United Kingdom will look tothe Organisation to interpret the article, with the footnote forming part of it, asauthority equitably to consider such proposals as might be put forward for newpreferences between particular component territories of our economic group.They will expect such proposals to be considered on the same basis as proposalscovered by the article for preferences with the same end in view between othercountries.   This they regard as the object of the footnote.   They will feel it
necessary to watch the administration of this article very carefully so that thereis no unfairness between the treatment of the British Commonwealth and that ofother economic groups.I must also refer to the article dealing with exceptions to the rule of non-discrimination. This has provided one of the most difficult and complicatedproblems of the conference. The matter is one of vital concern to countries likeour own, whose economies have been subjected to such violent strains in the achieve-ment of common victory in a long and terrible war. For some years to come, such countries will require latitude to depart from the strict rule of non-discrimination.This, in a certain measure, is provided by the article in question. The UnitedKingdom, in common, we believe, with many other countries, will need to make full use of this latitude in the efforts which, at the cost of great sacrifices to herpeople, she is now making to secure another victory and to bring nearer thecommon aims behind the Charter of restoring convertibility and full multilateral trade. Without the United Kingdom, one of the world&apos;s greatest markets andone of the world&apos;s greatest exporters, those aims could not be achieved. Thisarticle is designed to meet the immediate position; we shall have to take full advantage of its provisions.I have emphasised the fact that signature of the Final Act of this Conferenceon behalf ,of the United Kingdom is a decision not taken lightly by the Govern-ment of my country; it is a decision the importance of which will not, I hope, be lost on the other countries here represented. But, while it signifies that my government intend to recommend this Charter in due course to the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom, their ability to do so when the time comes will necessarily depend upon circumstances not fully within their own control. These will include in particular the general balance of payments position in which the UnitedKingdom then finds herself and also finds other countries upon which her economylargely depends and whose economies depend largely upon her own.....&quot;4. Extract from Statement by the President of the Board of Trade in the Houseof Commons on 15th April, 19494&quot;. ... I have made available in the House to-day the documents resulting fromthis Conference. One of these papers reproduces the text of the Havana charter of the International Trade Organisation which was authenticated by the FinalAct of the Conference. Apart from certain points to which the United kingdom delegate made reference in the final plenary sessions of the Conference, the effectof the Charter generally does not materially differ from the Geneva draft, whichhas already been laid before Parliament as Cmd. 7212, but hon. Members will no doubt wish to have the opportunity to study it. Although His Majesty&apos;sGovernment hope in due course, if circumstances are favourable, to recommend the Charter to Parliament with a view to acceptance, it is not their intention todo this in the immediate future.
