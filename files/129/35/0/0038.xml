4) a      .     /..&apos;-----    199THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret . P. (49)  1488TH JULY.  1949THE LONDON DOCK strike memorandum by the Attorney-general at the Cabinet meeting on 7th July I raised a questionwhether, in the then existing circumstances, the proclamation ofa state of emergencj&apos;- would produce any manifestly useful result,since the action then contemplated under the emergency powerswas to order the Port employers, on behalf of His Majesty, towork all ships now idle, a course which, without compelling the dockers to resume work on the two disputed Canadian ships, wouldenable them to go back to work on all the other ships now idle,this being something which they are in any event anxious to doand would do, if permitted, without the need to declare any state of emergency.2. Since then the situation in connection with the stoppage has shown a possibility of deteriorating in a manner which may leave the Government little alternative to invitingHis Majesty to proclaim a state of emergency, and I have beenasked by the Emergencies Committee to explain the action whichI suggest might subsequently be taken.3. There is no power under the ordinary law or under theEmergency Powers Act to introduce anything in the nature ofindustrial conscription by compelling men to work, although there is, of course, a power of direction under Regulation 58Aof the Defence Regulations.     But under the Dock Labour Schemedisciplinary machinery is provided by Articles 16 and 17 which enables the local Board (subject to appeal) to suspend a registered dock worker or to dismiss him summarily and removehis name from the register for misconduct.     Moreover, underthe ordinary law an action for damages v/ould lie in the county court against a dock worker who broke his contract of employ-ment.      Apparently the local Board and the employers respectivelyhave neglected to use these powers because of the repercussionswhich they feared might follow from them.      I express no opinionwhether these fears were well founded, although the exercise ofthe powers could hardly have produced more calamitous conse-quences than those resulting from the decision by the port employers on 27th June that they v/ould not thereafter work anyships on which work had not been started at that date, a matter to which I refer later.4. &quot;    It is, however, possible that, whatever might have beenthe repercussions had the local Board operated Articles 16 and17 of the Scheme or the employers brought actions for damageson their own initiative, these repercussions would not occur ifsimilar action were taken on the direction of the Government.I therefore suggest that if a state of emergency is proclaimedthe initial action to be taken should be broadly as follows(a)   A Port Emergency Committee should be appointed forth-with with power to act on behalf of His Majesty(Article 1 of the draft Regulations).      It is ofimportance that that Committee should consist of copy NO. 3CABINET

administrators of standing rather than mere experts,and that it should be independent of the bodies itwill have to control.(b) That Committee should direct that work on unloading orloading all ships now idle should at once be resumed and that the Port employers, acting on behalf of HisMajesty, should call for labour for this purposeunder the Scheme.(c) That Committee should further direct the Dock labour board to operate all provisions of the Scheme,including the disciplinary provisions of Articles16 and 17.(d) In the result calls would be made for labour in theordinary course.      If, on such calls being made inrespect of the two disputed Canadian ships, the men called did not report, the local Board would presumably dismiss the individuals concerned andremove their names from the register.      If this were followed, in selected cases, by summonses claimingdamages being issued out of the County Court themen might realise the serious consequences which their action was bringing on their own heads.5. I should add that it is doubtful whether a directionin the terms suggested in paragraph U(c) above would itself be legally enforceable.      I do not think that matters.     The men would know that the disciplinary provisions of the Scheme werenot being operated, as they might otherwise think, at the whimof local Boards in whose members they had no confidence but atthe insistence of the Government on the part of the community,it is, indeed, possible that other powers vrtiich the Regulationspurport, to give may not be strictly intra vires the Act.      Ihave advised that this risk should be taken and that theRegulations should cover matters on which action is requiredwithout undue regard to the niceties of the law.      In anemergency the Government may have, in matters admitting of legaldoubt, to act first and argue about the doubts later, ifnecessary obtaining an indemnification Act.      Ho such necessitywould, however, arise in connection with the present matter,since the local Boards would be operating their powers under theScheme ,and the fact that they were doing so following a possiblyultra vires direct ion from the Port Emergency Committee would beimmaterial.      The important thing, as it seems to me, is that theLabour Scheme&quot; must be worked.      Indeed, it may be thought by someunfortunate to have to use the sledge hammer of emergency powers or even to condemn the Dock Labour Scheme when little seriousattempt seems to have been made to operate the Scheme or theordinary law.6. If the action suggested under paragraph h turned out to be ineffective, consideration might have to be given todirecting labour under the Defence Regulations.7. It may be useful to take this opportunity of dealingwith certain other matters which have been raised in the present discussions.8, The right to withhold one&apos;s labour - i. e. the rightto strike - is an individual right which is in no way conditional upon the approval of the Executive of any particular Trade Union.strike exists when any body of men in fact acting in concertcease work.      There is nothing in the Dock Labour Scheme, nor Iapprehend could there be, which limits the right to strike.The Scheme does not create any penal obligation to obey orders:its terms simply form the contract of employment.      It is a

usual incident of any employment that orders should be obeyed,and the Dock Labour Scheme is not peculiar in this.      On theother hand strikes often have taken place because the ordersgiven create conditions of work which are -unacceptable to theworkmen, and not infrequently such strikes involve breaches of contract.      Legally there is no distinction under the Schemebetween a refusal to work a particular cargo because,  e.g.  itis dangerous, and a refusal to work it because it is con-sidered &quot;black&quot;.      The only remedy in either case is to rely on the disciplinary provisions of the Scheme or to claimdamages for breach of contract.9. I expressed a view on Thursday as to the extent towhich the present stoppage is to be considered a lockoutrather than a strike.      The information on which that view was based now appears to have been inaccurate.      As I am nowadvised the sequence of events has been as follows:-(a) In April and May the seamen on two Canadian, ships,berthing respectively in the Surrey and Royal groups of Docks, struck work, they believing, rightly orwrongly,that on their return to Canada they wouldnot be re-engaged unless they joined the Seamen&apos;international Union instead of the Canadian Seamen?union.      This action may have been illegal and/or abreech of contract.      It was none the less a strikeconstituting a trade dispute.(b) Thereupon stevedores alleging that this was a rightwhich had always been recognised refused to work thetwo ships involved, treating them as in dispute.Incidentally they appear then to have been and nowto remain wholly misinformed as to the status of thetwo competing Unions, believing that almost allCanadian seamen belong to the Canadian Seamen&apos;union.(c) The stevedores&apos; action no doubt constituted a strike,but the Port employers and the Labour Boardacquiesced in the position until 27th June.(d) On 27th .June the Port employers announced that, whilework would continue on ships then in course ofloading or unloading, no labour would be requisitionedin respect of ships on which work had not begun.This amounted in effect to an announcement of a lock-out in respect of future ships.(e) Neither employers nor workers gave notice under theConditions of Employment and Arbitration Order(1305).(f) On the same day that a lockout was announced thestevedores withdrew from ships in the course ofworking.(g) Subsequently a certain number of stevedores in otherdocks struck work in sympathjr.(h) It follows that there is a strike in relation tocertain of the ships and a lockout in relation to others.      It is therefore not possible in law togive unqualified support to the view that thepresent stoppage is a strike, but the legal right toexercise emergency powers does not, of course,depend on this consideration.-3-

10. It was a Bleed whether the Emergency Powers Act, 1920,provides all the powers which may in fact be required.      It isclear that the Act does not enable men to be compelled to workand there is some doubt whether it enables Regulations to bemade overriding statutory enactments made since 1920.      On thewhole, I think it does enable action to be taken which is inconsistent with the existing statute or common lav/, althoughit does not admit of the direct and permanent amendment orrepeal of the law.      The Act is also possibly deficient in notenabling powers to be delegated under the Regulations permittingorders and directions of legislative effect to be given bysubordinate officers.      But it may be thought inexpedient toask Parliament for further powers at present, especially as there still are certain powers under the Defence Regulations.Moreover, for the reasons stated in paragraph (5)9 I do notsuppose that&apos;the Government will feel called upon to be tooastute in discovering in advance possible legal limitations onthe generally wide powers which the Act does create.H.
