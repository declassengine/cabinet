 95IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITiu\TNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&apos;SECR E TCP. (k10) 1U79IE JULY.  19A9COPY NO. iCABINETREPORT OP THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE PRESSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMr. Eden has announced the intention of the Oppositionto provide time for a debate on the Report of the Royal Commissionon the Press and the House will expect the Government to give ita lead.2. It seems to me. that the Royal Commission has fully justified its appointment by the first-rate&apos; survey of the british press which it has produced]    this has the additional merit ofbeing extremely readable, and it is to be hoped that it will beas widely studied as possible.    There is much indeed to be said for the view that it would be in the public interest that thereshould be periodical inquiries into the Press say at ten yearly intervals;   we have come to take it for granted that the B.B.C.should be the subject of such inquiries, and. if the B.B.C. is a monopoly, the Press is unique among our great institutions inenjoying a virtual monopoly of freedom from outside public criticism.centred on the statement in paragraph 348 of the, Report;&quot;It is generally agreed that, the British Press is inferior tonone in the world&quot;.   In fact, the Royal Commission has giventhe Press - notably the popular newspapers - much less than aclean bill    and if additional evidence is needed of the validity of some of its criticisms, this is provided by the vray in whichmost newspapers have handled the serious complaints made by theRoyal Commission on such matters as political bias in presenting,news, lapses of taste,  sensationalism and inexcusable inaccuraciesand errors of emphasis.   As was stated by the &quot;Observer&quot;    (3rd July);&quot;Almost every popular newspaper summarised the findings of theRoyal Commission in a manner favourable to themselves.   No one who relied on these papers for his information could have guessedthat much of the Commission^ report was unfavourable to our industry or profession&quot;.   The &quot;Observer&quot;&apos; was also unusual, though not unique, in publishing in full the severe criticism which theCommission made of a story by its Political Correspondent and inadmitting the validity of the criticism.3. No impartial reader could deny that, on balance, thereport is distinctly critical of large sections of the Presson important aspects of their activities.   I think, personally thatthe Commission has let the Press down lightly, that seme of itscriticisms might have been sharper, and that its approach to someof the major problems of newspaper ownership and control isunduly timid.    I think it would, have been justified by theevidence in making more positive recommendations, but its analysis of the present state of affairs seems to me on- the whole balancedand sound, and v/e can hardly come forward with alternative proposals.    In all the circumstances,  therefore, I think that thereport is one which the Government should in general accept.-1-

4* The Royal Commission has made the followingspecific proposals: -(i)   That the Press should establish a General Councilconsisting of at least 25 members representingproprietors, editors and other journalists, andhaving lay members amounting to about 20$To of thetotal, including the Chairman.   The lay members should be nominated jointly by the Lord chief justice and the Lord President, of the Courtof Session, who in choosing the other lay members should consult the Chairman.   The Chairman, on whom a heavy burden of work v/ill fall, should be paid.(ii)   The law should be amended as follows:(a) Powers of inquiry similar to those of theBoard of Trade under sections 172 and 173of the Companies Act, 1948, should be conferred on the Registrar of friendly societies in respect of any societiesregistered under the Industrial andProvident Societies Acts which publishnewspapers or periodicals or engage inthe business of a news agency.    (Paragraph 614)*(b) Chain newspapers should be required to carryon the front page a formula clearlyindicating their common ownership.(Paragraph 610).(c) If local monopolies in a considerable area,whether rural or urban, should be foundnot to be within the purview of the monopolies commission, the Monopolies and restrictive practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948,should be amended to bring newspaper monopoliesin areas of this size within its scope.(Paragraph 608).(iii) That, the present agreement in the industry to t*e rainfrom non-journalistic forms of competition should be prolonged indefinitely.5. The actual establishment of the proposed general council of the Press would be a matter for the Press itself, butI think that we should say that we favour the recommendation and hope that the Press will give effect to it:    if the Press doesnot act, we must consider the matter again.    It seems to me right that, as proposed, it should contain representatives ofproprietors, editors and other journalists and have a substantiallay element including the Chairman.    It may be true that withoutthe laymen the Council would be more likely to command the loyalsupport of the Press, but it is desirable to include laymen bothin order to avoid the risk that the C0&quot;^cil might take too narrowa view of its responsibilities and in order that it should enjoy the confidence of the general public.The Royal Commission proposes that the lay members,including the Chairman, should be nominated jointly by the lord chief Justice and the Lord President of the Court of Session;it should be made clear that the Government cannot say whether theLord Chief Justice and the Lord President of the Court of session would be prepared to assume the proposed responsibility, andtheir attitude inight very well depend upon the final shape ofthe scheme.

It may be suggested that the Government shouldfinance the Council on the ground that if it were financed by thePress it would not be sufficiently independent: . the same question would arise if the Press v/ere unwilling to assume theresponsibility.   I am sure, however, that wo should be extremelychary of suggesting Government financing.   It would be bound tobe represented as evidence of a desire for Governmental inter-ference, and it would presumably open the door to parliamentary questions and other Parliamentary discussion.6. On the questions requiring legislation, I do notthink that we need or can go further than that, while we are notprepared to commit ourselves finally, we would be sympathetically .disposed to legislation to give effect to the GommissionVsrecommendations at a convenient opportunity *7. We should endorse the recommendation that the agreement to refrain from non-journalistic forms of competition should be prolonged indefinitely.   We should also endorse the hope of theRoyal Commission that the large chains will grow no larger,(Paragraph 350).8. There are two other matters mentioned by theCommission on which statements may be expected from theGove rnment sp oke sman *(i)    The Commission devoted a section to government information services (paragraphs 536 to 5k3) *   It reachedthe conclusion that the evidence &quot;does not suggestthat up to now any harmful influence is being exertedon the Press through the medium of the government information services;   but if newspapers get out ofthe habit of finding their own news and into the habit of taking all or most of it unquestioninglyfrom a Government department they are obviously insome danger of falling into totalitarian paths.Future developments therefore need to be carefully watched.i!The reference to totalitarianism may be somewhatexaggerated, but I think that we can accept andendorse the Commission&apos;s observations.    It suggestselsewhere (paragraph 654-) that the properrelationship between the Press and government information officers is one of the matters whichthe proposed General Council might properly take upon behalf of the Pressj    I see no objection to this and theremay be much to be said for it.(ii)    The Royal Commission naturally emphasises the--     desirability of further increases in the supply of newsprint as soon as the economic position allows, and,in particular, expresses the hope that considerationvail be given as supplies increase to the possibilityof lifting the present restrictions on the use of newsprint for new papers (paragraph 603).   We can nodoubt say that we are anxious to do everythingpracticable in both respects when the circumstances permit.9.I ask the Cabinet to agree that the government spokesman in the. forthcoming debate should be authorised to state the point of view of the Government on the linos suggested above.H.M.&apos;Privy Council Office, S.W.I.,9th July, 1949.-3-
