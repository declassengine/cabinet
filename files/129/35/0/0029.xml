THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTREACTIONS  TO  THE   COMMONWEALTH   DECLARATION   OF27th APRIL, 1949Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations . My colleagues will wish to be informed of the reactions in the various countries concerned to the Commonwealth Declaration issued at the conclusionof the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in April. On the whole, theDeclaration has been given &quot;a good press&quot; in all Member&apos;countries of theCommonwealth. It has been welcomed as an amicable and generally acceptablecompromise solution to a difficult problem and as renewed evidence of the strengthand flexibility of the Commonwealth association. The least enthusiastic publicreactions have been in Pakistan, where there has been considerable criticism inthe press of the Declaration itself, and of Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan for acquiescing in an arrangement which, it is considered in some quarters, has been acceptedby the Other countries concerned only in order to retain Indian goodwill in viewof the present unrest in South-East Asia and the Far East. Indeed, as the pakistan Prime Minister expected, the Declaration has given rise to a consider-able demand in the press that Pakistan should declare itself an Islamic Republic.In India there has been very wide public support for Pandit Nehru&apos;s speechesdefending the Declaration. The only criticisms which have been maintainedthere have come from a few papers on the extreme Left.2. In order to gain a comprehensive picture of public reactions to theCommonwealth Declaration, my colleagues may like to read the annexed twosummaries of press and public reactions in Commonwealth countries, which havebeen prepared in my Department. The first of these (Appendix I) covers reports received during the first fortnight after the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting; thesecond (Appendix II) covers the subsequent period up to the end of May.3. The Prime Ministers of the other member countries of the Commonwealth,have all made statements, in Parliament or elsewhere, since the issue of theDeclaration.. The main points in these are referred to in the summaries.4. In Canada, Mr. St. Laurent read the Declaration in the House ofCommons on 27th April and it was warmly welcomed by the leaders of the twoOpposition Parties. Although some Conservative papers have expressed mis-givings lest the Crown link be weakened, the general attitude in Canada has been one of satisfaction and it is perhaps significant that there seems, so far, to havebeen no tendency to introduce this subject into the Canadian general election campaign.5. In Australia, Mr. Chifley spoke briefly about the Declaration in theHouse of Representatives on 18th May. I understand that a debate will takeplace there later. In the meantime, Mr. Menzies, the leader of the Opposition, has expressed his disapproval of the Declaration. He is reported as saying that thePrime Ministers have thrown away all the elements which made the British.Commonwealth of Nations a united people.Printed for the Cabinet.

6. In New Zealand, Mr. Fraser made a brief public statement on his return from London and promised a further statement in the House of Eepresentativeswhen it reassembles at the end of June.7. In South Africa, Dr. Malan made a long statement in the House of assembly on 11th May. Extracts from his speech, and from the speech by Field-Marshal Smuts in the debate which followed, are annexed (Appendix III). Itwill be noted that Dr. Malan said that he believed that South Africa&apos;s best chance of unity was &quot;when we become a Republic,&quot; but that at the presentmoment there were other vital issues which must be solved, and in order to beable to solve them South Africans must seek unity and stand together. But,whether they believed in the Crown link or were republicans, all sections in SouthAfrica were agreed that they wanted to remain in the Commonwealth, providedno restrictions were placed on their freedom.8. In a statement issued at the conclusion of the Prime Ministers&apos; MeetingField-Marshal Smuts reiterated the misgivings he had expressed in a similar statement a fortnight earlier and said that in the change now made there was&quot; implicit permission, if not encouragement and invitation,&quot; to the other Membersof the Commonwealth like South Africa with strong republican movements oftheir own to follow India&apos;s example, with consequences which might strain theCommonwealth to the limit. Speaking in the House of Assembly on 11th May,Field-Marshal Smuts said that he appreciated the reasons why the PrimeMinisters had decided as they did about India, but he hoped that India&apos;s case would be treated as an exception.9. In India, Pandit Nehru, on 16th and 17th May, submitted the declaration to the Constituent Assembly for &quot;ratification.&quot; Pandit Nehru&apos;s speechesopening and winding-up the Constituent Assembly debate are annexed(Appendix IV). These speeches are remarkable for their friendly tone; I thinkmy colleagues will agree that the Prime Minister of India has explained to hiscountrymen India&apos;s new relationship with the Commonwealth with true states-manship, and in a way most likely to help both India and the other countries concerned to implement the decision of the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting with easeand goodwill.&apos; It is worth noting also that the Indian Constituent Assemblyadopted the Prime Minister&apos;s resolution to ratify the Declaration by an over-whelming majority.10. On his return to Pakistan, Mr. Liaquat A li Khan broadcast, on 25th May,to the people of Pakistan about his visit to this country and the Middle East.The part of that broadcast which was devoted to the outcome of the Common-wealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting is annexed (Appendix V). From what mr. Liaquat Ali Khan said it seems likely that the Pakistan ConstituentAssembly will debate the Prime Ministers&apos; Declaration and its implications forPakistan in due course. The Constituent Assembly is not, I think, due to meet (until October.11. On his return to Ceylon, Mr. Senanayake expressed himself as pleased,on the whole, with the outcome of the Meeting. To a press conference he saidthat he thought the consensus of opinion in Ceylon found her constitution andrelationship with other Commonwealth Members satisfactory.12. I propose to bring to the attention of my colleagues any further reportsof significance which I may receive about developments relating to the PrimeMinisters&apos; Declaration of April, 1949, and the texts of any further statements ofspecial importance made about it by Ministers in other Commonwealth countries.P.

APPENDIX I summary OF COMMONWEALTH PRESS AND PUBLIC reactions to THE COMMONWEALTH DECLARATION AS RECEIVED INLONDON AT 11th MAY, 19491.   canada the Declaration, read by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, wasgreeted with loud applause, and the leaders of the Progressive Conservatives,the C.C.F., and the Social Credit Parties made statements warmly welcoming it.The Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto press gave the Declaration a virtuallyunanimous welcome and regarded it as a tribute to the adaptability of british political thought. Relief was expressed that India had agreed to recognise TheKing as Head of the Commonwealth. The English language Press stressed thefact that the position of the Crown in other Commonwealth countries remains unchanged. Mr. Pearson, Minister for External Affairs and Canada&apos;s Representa-tive at the Conference, broadcasting from London soon after the Declaration hadbeen published, said that it strengthened the Commonwealth association and,above all, maintained a firm bridge, through that association, between the East&apos;and the West. He said that to Canada the Crown meant no impairment ofher freedom, but on the contrary- symbolised the continuity of her historicaldevelopment and the depth and strength of her democratic roots.2.   australia the Canberra, Sydney, and Melbourne press gave a very favourable opinionof the Declaration, which they regarded generally as a reasonable compromisein a difficult situation. Alongside tributes to the statesmanship which broughtabout the agreement, some doubts were expressed whether India would accept the responsibilities as well as the privileges of Commonwealth membership.Mr: Menzies, Leader of the Opposition, speaking personally, said that theDeclaration damaged considerably the family relationship under the Crown. Inhis view the decision was indicative of a process of retreat and disintegration,and was disturbing to millions of British people. He thought, however, thatno Australian could dispute India&apos;s right to become a republic. The Leader ofthe Liberals deplored the dropping of the word &quot;British&quot; and the weakening of the Crown link. The Prime Minister, on his return to Canberra, said thatwhile he regretted that India&apos;s decision to become a republic had made it necessaryto hold a Conference in London to discuss India&apos;s future relationship with theCommonwealth, he felt that in all the circumstances the agreement reached wasin the best interests of the British Commonwealth.3. New zealand the press generally was favourable to the Declaration and praised thestatesmanship and typically British ability to compromise which produced soquick a solution to this difficult problem. The omission of the word &quot; British &quot;was regretted, but satisfaction was expressed that the sovereignty of the Crownhad been fully maintained so far as New Zealand is concerned. There was generalagreement as to the advantage of retaining India within the Commonwealth.Mr. Nash, the Acting Prime Minister, voiced the Government&apos;s congratulations to Mr. Fraser for his part in the Conference. Mr. Doidge, National Party,expressed bewilderment at the seemingly paradoxical decision to maintain are public within a monarchial framework a decision which he described asfarcical, and possibly tragic in its consequences. In a statement in London, thePrime Minister said that New Zealand would have preferred to continue theexisting Commonwealth ties and form of association. It was, however, obviousthat conditions suitable to one member were not necessarily equally acceptable to others, and the Declaration represented the maximum amount of agreementpossible.   New Zealand&apos;s allegiance to the Crown remained unimpaired.4. South Africa -The press generally expressed satisfaction that a formula had been foundwhich permits India to remain in the Commonwealth, though there was an under-37154 B 2
tone of criticism that India had been allowed to &quot;get away with it.&quot; Therewas some doubt as to whether, in view of the new Commonwealth decision, SouthAfrica&apos;s present position, as a member of the Commonwealth considering herselffree to declare herself a republic if circumstances should demand, would continueto satisfy the more fervent nationalists. Moderate elements were in favour ofthe new Commonwealth concept. Field-Marshal Smuts expressed considerabledoubts about the Declaration and said he thought the Crown had been reduced toa vague symbol. He thought the Declaration was so worded as to leave other commonwealth countries free to go the way India had gone. This, he said, wasnot &quot;a natural evolution &quot; but \&apos; a leap in the dark,&quot; and he felt that graverisks had been taken in agreeing to such a step. Dr. Malan, on his return toCapetown, said that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; decision had beenunanimous, and he was glad that it had been so well received by all commonwealth countries, including South Africa. If the Commonwealth had been kept on arigid basis it would have been doomed. The change which had now been made would keep it alive.5.   india the Declaration had a very good press, except in the more extreme left-wing quarters, though there was a tendency to adopt a policy of &quot; wait and see.&quot;Hopes were expressed that the agreement would have the effect of increasedBritish help for India in the industrial sphere, and of easing the Indian-SouthAfrican issue. To Pandit Nehru was attributed a leading part in the Conference,and Mr. Attlee also had a good press. Sardar Patel, Deputy Prime Minister,meeting the press on the day of the publication of the Declaration, acknowledgedthe co-operation and assistance received from the other countries of the Common-wealth in finding a solution to India&apos;s special problem. He assured his hearersthat India&apos;s future status would be republican in both internal and external affairs. On the other hand, India&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth would continue unbroken, though her recognition of The King would be limited tohis position as a symbol of a free association of independent nations. He hopedthat members of the Commonwealth would welcome the new association in a spiritof friendliness and goodwill. India would not use the word &quot; British &quot; before&quot; Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; The Indian Socialist Party&apos;s view was that thiswas the greatest mistake committed by the Congress Party since partition, andthat the Socialists would take the first opportuntiy that came to them of undoingwhat they described as a great national blunder. The Declaration was described by Mr. Sarat Chandra Bose, President of the Socialist Republican Party, as a&quot; great betrayal.&quot; Pandit Nehru, speaking at a meeting in London on 2nd May,challenged criticisms of the Declaration which had been made in the Indian press,and added : &quot; I feel that this agreement to which I gave consent is a good thingfor India, for England, for the Commonwealth and for the world.&quot; referring to allegations that the Declaration tied India to follow the policies of other powers, he said : &quot; Our policy of non-alignment remains as it was. It has not changed in the slightest. It is to the interest of the Commonwealth that this ishould be so.&quot;6.   PakistanAlthough first reactions to the Declaration were not clearly defined, theopinion was expressed in a number of quarters that India had &quot; stolen a march &quot;on Pakistan, and that the ultimate result would be to hasten the time whenPakistan would also seek complete independence in some form or other. Therewas no direct criticism of the Declaration, but a certain amount of jealousy ofthe Commonwealth recognition of India&apos;s special position. Other points madeincluded a request for further clarification of the position of The King, and ofthe phrase &quot; Head of the Commonwealth&quot;, and the view that Pakistan should become an independent Islamic State, though not necessarily outside the Common-wealth. There was a general tendency to reserve considered comment for thePrime Minister&apos;s return when a full-dress debate on the Conference is expected in the Constituent Assembly. Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, in a statement in London,said that as a result of the Declaration it would henceforth be open to any memberof the Commonwealth to&apos;take the step which India had taken. Pakistan had full freedom to shape its own constitution and choose the form of its futurerelationship with the Commonwealth.
7.   CeylonThe Declaration had a good press in both the English and vernacular papers,and satisfaction was expressed that a solution to the problem had been amicablyand unanimously reached. The general reaction was one of quiet acceptance ofthe new Commonwealth decision and satisfaction that the family circle remainedunbroken. Editorial comment contained praise for the adaptability of theCommonwealth to changing circumstances, and the suggestion that by the Declara-tion the Commonwealth had added to its stature. There was no indication thatCeylon is other than happy to continue without reservation her membership ofthe Commonwealth. Mr. Senanayake, on his return to Colombo, said that while he personally regretted that India had found it desirable to modify its Common-wealth relationship, he fully recognised her right to decide her own form of constitution. He said that while he had stated in London Ceylon&apos;s independence and right to secede from the Commonwealth, he thought that the consensus ofopinion in Ceylon was content with her present position and relationship to other commonwealth countries.8.   United KingdomAlmost without exception the press was warmly in favour of the Declaration,and tribute was paid in many quarters to the Prime Minister&apos;s skilful andstatesmanlike contribution to it. Some doubts as to the true meaning of theDeclaration were expressed by a few papers. After the text of the Declarationhad been read in - the House of Commons on the day of its publication,Mr. Churchill voiced the general feeling of the House, that the undoubted answer to the question : &apos; &apos;Do we wish India to remain of her own free will and desirewithin the Commonwealth or not?&quot; was &quot;Aye.&quot; He went on to say that hewas unfeighedly glad that an impassable gulf had not opened between the newIndia and the Commonwealth, and thought the step would be a help to all infuture. He did not feel that the majesty of the Crown or the personal dignityof The King had been impaired by the condition under which India was continuing membership of the Commonwealth. The Liberals expressed satisfac-tion at the Declaration. Mr. Morrison, speaking for the Government, welcomed the general support given to the Declaration, and said that the more all parts ofthe House could march together on Commonwealth matters, the better it was foreverybody.Information Department, Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, S.W. 1.11th May, 1949.APPENDIX ii summary OF COMMONWEALTH PRESS AND PUBLIC reactions to THE COMMONWEALTH DECLARATION AS RECEIVED INLONDON AT 31st MAY, 19491. canada the press in Newfoundland, the Maritimes, and the Western Provinces took the same general line as the Ottawa and Toronto press (reported in the earliersummary). Some Conservative papers expressed misgivings about the weakening of monarchical ties, and doubts were expressed in some quarters about the con-stitutional meaning of the phrase &quot; Head, of the Commonwealth.&quot; There wasalso a tendency in some press comment to regard the Declaration as havingreduced the Crown link to the status of a vague symbol and the family of nations to a mere collection of independent States. The predominant note, however, wasone of satisfaction that India is to continue within the Commonwealth, whichstands to gain strength by her membership.
2. australia the press was generally favourable and regarded the Declaration as a mani-festation of goodwill. There was, however, a certain amount of questioning asto what India&apos;s future position would involve, and whether she would accept anyobligations, especially in the realm of defence.In Parliament on 18th May, Mr. Chifley reiterated the view that the new relationship with India was in the best interests of the British Commonwealth,and that the new position taken up by India would not change in any respect the relationship of the other Commonwealth countries to the Crown or to each other.In particular, Australia^ allegiance to the Crown would remain unaltered. Heconfirmed the Opposition assumption that beyond what had been made public, no new arrangement or obligation, expressed or implied, had been arrived at in theLondon discussions. Mr. Menzies maintained his criticism of the London Con-ference which, he said at an Empire Day rally at Melbourne, had produced a formula which reduced the status of the Crown from &apos;&apos; pulsing reality to a heart-less lawyer&apos;s document.&quot; He deplored the way in which the commonwealth prime Ministers had thrown away all the elements which had made the BritishCommonwealth of Nations a united people.3. New zealand the press in general continued to be favourable to the Declaration. TheOpposition press, with very few exceptions, appeared to have taken its cue fromMr. Churchill. There were suggestions in press quarters that in the light of theDeclaration it might be possible to bring Eire and Burma into the Commonwealthfold, and perhaps also other independent countries. Mr. Fraser, on his return from London, described the results of the Conference as more successful than hehad dared to hope. He stressed that in London he had made it clear that NewZealand could not agree to any diminution of her bond of allegiance to the Crown,and he described New Zealand&apos;s concept of Commonwealth relationship as &quot; notmerely independence, but independence with something of great value added.&quot;JEe felt that the willingness of other members of the Commonwealth to meetIndia&apos;s special requirements would strengthen the bonds of friendship and understanding between India and the rest of the Commonwealth. In the onlyOpposition comment of note, Mr. Doidge criticised the London Declaration as having destroyed the concept of common Sovereignty, and deplored the fact thatthe Throne was no longer the granite rock upon which the British Constitution isbuilt.4. South AfricaSome press comment suggested that in present world conditions it made littlesense to argue whether South Africa&apos;s interests were best served by being a republicinside the Commonwealth or a republic outside it. In a statement in Parlia-ment on 11th May, Dr. Malan said that he believed that the greatest unity wouldbe obtained in South Africa by that country becoming a republic, but that all sections in South Africa were agreed that they wanted to remain in the Common-wealth provided no restrictions were placed on their freedom. He described theCommonwealth as a &quot; living organism &apos;&apos; and the work of the Conference as&quot; constructive.&quot; It was not true to say that the Commonwealth was disinte-grating; the Conference had revealed the unity and power of the Commonwealth.Field-Marshal Smuts said that he was satisfied with the Prime Ministers&apos;Declaration except for the arrangement made about India. He hoped that thiswould be regarded as exceptional and not as a precedent to be followed by SouthAfrica, for if the Commonwealth were to be a force in world politics, it was important that the common allegiance of its members should, as a general rule, bemaintained. In a further statement on 12th May, Dr. Malan stated that he didnot contemplate the establishment of a South African Republic within the life ofthe present Parliament, and that &quot; even if we are a republic, we shall remain amember of the Commonwealth.&quot; Mr. Strydom described the objective of theNationalist Party as a republic outside the Commonwealth. He hinted that there might be an intermediate stage in the achievement of this policy, in doing whatIndia has done before taking the final step.5. india with a very few exceptions the press supported Pandit Nehru&apos;s defence ofthe Declaration on his return to Delhi, and praised both his part in the London
discussions and his frankness in dealing with, criticism. The ConstituentAssembly &apos;s ratification of the Declaration was warmly welcomed editorially.Criticisms were maintained by a very few papers of the extreme left wing. Ina broadcast from Delhi on 10th May, Pandit Nehru said that his impression since his return was that the vast majority of the Indian people welcomed the Londondecision. The Declaration left India free to follow her declared foreign policyof avoiding alignment with any Power bloc and of fighting imperialism andracial discrimination, and indeed would enable India to pursue that policy in greater measure and with greater influence. He had entered into no secret commit-ments. He felt convinced&quot; that in agreeing to the Declaration he had adhered to all his past pledges, and that the action he took in London, so far from injuringIndia in any way, had kept her honour bright and enhanced her position inthe world. Pandit Nehru also spoke in the Constituent Assembly on 16th and17th May on the motion to ratify the Commonwealth Declaration. He emphasised that the Declaration did not imply any diminution of India&apos;s sovereignty. Assp-ciation with other countries did not mean agreement with their policies, and he had agreed to India&apos;s continued membership of the Commonwealth as being beneficial to India and to world causes which India wanted to advance. In a worldwhere so many disruptive forces were at work, the break-up of any association was not a thing to be encouraged. His approach to the London Conference was as representative of an India which had washed out all the bitterness of the past,and which had faith and confidence in her own future. He attached value tothe Declaration as &quot; a method which brings a touch of healing with it.&quot; he felt it was important that India would now enter upon her republican statuswith the goodwill of many others, and without leaving a trace of bitternessbehind. He felt that Gandhi would have approved the manner in which this step had been taken. He commended the Declaration to the House as a harbingerof good relations and as an indication that India was willing to act in a generousspirit in the cause of peace. The Constituent Assembly ratified the LondonDelcaration on 17th May with only one dissentient vote.6.   Pakistan, After initial fairly favourable reactions, the press became increasinglycritical of the Declaration, and much of its comment was coloured by obviousjealousy and suspicion of India&apos;s special position. The view was widely expressed that the United Kingdom, under pressure of the Communist threat to South-east asia, had given way to India&apos;s demands in order that India should stand asa bulwark against the &apos; Red &apos; flood. The general opinion that Pakistan hadbeen out-manoeuvred by India gave rise to a number of demands in the press that Pakistan should declare herself an Islamic Republic as soon as possible.This critical and suspicious attitude merged into a press campaign against mr.. Liaquat Ali Khan, who was accused of having gone beyond his brief in allowing himself to succumb to the persuasions of the other commonwealth prime Ministers. Mr. Liaquat A li Khan, in a broadcast on his return to Karachi,defended his action in London, and stressed that the Declaration left Pakistancompletely independent in internal and external affairs. In the London discus-sions he had not involved Pakistan in any commitments, and he had endeavoured to correct the impression that Pakistani membership of the Commonwealthwas something which could be taken for granted. As regards the future therewere three courses open to Pakistan; to retain the status quo, to follow India&apos;sexample, or to sever all connection^ with the Commonwealth. It was for theConstituent Assembly to decide between these alternatives.7.   CeylonThe press continued to react favourably to the Declaration, and notice wastaken of Mr-. churchill&apos;s acceptance of its terms. Mr. Senanayake, in a state-ment issued to the press after his return from London, pointed out that it was unnecessary for Ceylon to seek a new definition of her relationship to the crown and the Commonwealth, since that was already fully covered by Ceylon&apos;sConstitution. Ceylon&apos;s independence, and her right to secede, were beyond doubt.India&apos;s republican status would not affect the principles of Ceylon&apos;s relation-ship to India. He said he was very glad that the Commonwealth Prime ministers had been willing to adopt a formula whose phraseology enabled India to continuewithin the Commonwealth, while leaving unchanged the close Jies of relation-ship in respect of the rest of the Commonwealth.   The great majority of the
press echoed these sentiments and showed itself in favour of maintaining Ceylon&apos;?present link with the Crown.8.   United KingdomConsidered press comment continued to be favourable to the Declaration.News and statements from other Commonwealth countries, and especially reports from India about the discussions in the Constituent Assembly, were prominentlyfeatured. Broadcasting on Empire Day, Mr. Noel-Baker, Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations, said that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers hadparted at the end of the London Conference with common agreement that theproblem which they met to discuss had been solved solved with vision and faith.The Commonwealth had proved how flexible it was, and how a special problem could be solved by give and take. Mr. Anthony Eden, in an article, said itwas heartening news that India was to continue her membership of the Common-wealth, and he thought that the Declaration could have a decisive influence onthe course of history in Asia. He described the London decision as a rare example of what goodwill and good faith in discussions could achieve.Information Department,Commonwealth Relations Office,31st May, 1949.APPENDIX IIIEXTRACTS FROM SPEECH BY Dr. the Hon. D. F. MALAN, PRIMEMINISTER OF SOUTH AFRICA, IN SOUTH AFRICAN HOUSE of assembly, 11th MAY, 1949..... -Dr. Malan explained to the House the problem of India&apos;s future association with the Commonwealth to deal with which the Prime Ministers of the Common-.   wealth had met together in London in April 1949.   He went on to say: &quot; Now I should like to explain from what standpoint I approached this matter as the representative of this House and as the representative of South Africa.In the first place, the reply to this question as to now I approached this matter was given by me, partly at any rate, when I had to make a statement of policyin the Senate before my departure. In that speech I think I explained this position with the greatest possible clarity at my command. The attitude thatI adopted there was that the members of the Commonwealth were free and independent nations and that there could be no meddling in any way with thatfreedom and independence of the various members of the Commonwealth. our policy is to protect the freedom and the independence of the separate membersof the Commonwealth. That was the first point. The second point was thatthat freedom and independence of the separate members of the Commonwealthincluded the fullest right to determine their own destiny; it implied something that was mentioned years ago, a factor that played a great role in internationalor inter-Commonwealth discussions, namely, that every one of the separatemembers of the Commonwealth possesses to the fullest degree the right todetermine its own destiny. That was the second point. But the third point was this, that as long as the Commonwealth remained faithful to its owncharacter and as long as the Commonwealth did not impose restrictions on thefreedom and independence of its members or closed the door to further constitu-tional development on the part of the separate members of the Commonwealth,so long would we in South Africa remain a member of this closer circle of sister-nations known as the Commonwealth. I adhere to the attitude&quot; that I had explained here on a previous occasion, and at the conference I also approached the whole question that was under discussion from this point of view.&quot;Dr. Malan said that if the other members of the Commonwealth had said&quot;no&quot; to India&apos;s request to remain in the Commonwealth as a Republic the implications would have been that the other members of the commonwealth would have lost India&apos;s goodwill which would have had harmful results in the sphere of trade and not only the Commonwealth but all the anti-CommunistWestern Power would have lost an important foothold in Asia.   In addition,
particularly in the light of recent developments in Burma and Ireland, India&apos;sleaving the Commonwealth might have created the impression that the Common^wealth was disintegrating, that it was no longer a powerful force and that also would have been unfortunate in view of the Communist threat.&quot; Hon. members have seen the declaration that was issued towards the close of the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference. That declaration is self-explanatory. it means in the first place that the reply that was given to India was in the affirmative. Although India is becoming a republic she will remain a memberof the Commonwealth. What is the significance of this in relation to othermembers of the Commonwealth which are not republics? In that respect theposition remains unchanged. No change has come about as far as their positionis concerned. It further means that we will now have this position in the Common-wealth. The King will form part of the government of all the members of theCommonwealth except in the case of India. In our own South Africa Act, theGovernment of the country is described as consisting of The King, the senate and the Assembly. That is also the position in the case of the other membersof the Commonwealth, but in the case of India The King will not form partof the Government of India.   He does not form part of India&apos;s Constitution.&quot; Another matter that arises from the declaration is this : The relationship of the individual members of the Commonwealth towards the commonwealth as a whole remains unchanged, that is to say, any country that is a member ofthe Commonwealth retains the freedom that it has enjoyed hitherto in practice;the individual member of the Commonwealth is not bound by any policy laid down at the Commonwealth Conference or Prime Ministers&apos; Conference, or at theImperial Conference as it was known before. They bind themselves to consultone another and, as far as possible, to co-operate with one another. We can take it that to that extent they bind themselves morally. But nevertheless every member has the fullest right to differ from the other members and even to goso far as to oppose one another at international conferences; it has the rightto adopt a different attitude as we have seen in the past at San Francisco, forexample, in the case of Australia, and as we have seen time and again at inter-national conferences. That freedom of every, individual member of the Common-wealth remains intact, and that is of the utmost importance, because it means that the highest authority vests in the members of the Commonwealth themselves,and that every one of them remains a free and independent unit, a free and independent State. In no single case is the fate of any member determined from outside; it is not determined by another country as was the case years ago inthe days of the Empire. It is not determined either by the various countriesacting jointly or by any particular country from outside. Every member-state as the supreme authority in its own country, has its own destiny in its own hands.That freedom on the part of every individual member of the Commonwealth inrelation to the Commonwealth itself also remains unchanged.&quot; There is another thing that remains unchanged and that is that there neednot be any uniformity amongst the members of the Commonwealth with regardto such matters as immigration, or the granting of citizenship. This is nothingnew. This has been the position for many years. South Africa has its ownimmigration laws. Those laws differ completely from those of England. Forexample, England allows people from India, members of the Indian race, toenter England. There are no restrictions, but there are restrictions in SouthAfrica. Restrictions of this nature are also imposed by other members of theCommonwealth. Australia adopts the policy of &quot;White Australia,&quot; that isto say, that Australia, just like South Africa, does not allow inhabitants fromabroad, who are not Europeans, to enter the country. There is no uniformitybetween the various members of the Commonwealth. That position also remains unchanged. Every member of the Commonwealth has the fullest right to decide for itself what the composition of its population will be and to what extent it is prepared to grant or to refuse citizenship to others. That position, in any event, remains unchanged. That is the meaning of the declaration that was issued at the Conference.&quot;* * * * * *&quot; .... I had certain objections to the words &quot; head of the Commonwealth.&quot;My objection was this, that in describing The King as head of the Commonwealth37154 c
it might give rise to misunderstanding, misunderstanding in this respect thatit may create the impression that there is a super-State; that the Commonwealthis a super-State and that the individual members of it are, to a certain extentat any rate, in a subordinate position.&quot; I explained to the conference that it was necessary, particularly in the caseof South Africa, that there should be no misunderstanding with regard to thismatter, because in South Africa the Statute of Westminster had been submittedto Parliament for approval and because at that time there had been an importantdifference of opinion with regard to its interpretation. One school of thoughtmaintained that the Statute of Westminster meant that the rights of the various members of the Commonwealth were tantamount to this that they had theright to secede if they wished to do so; that they had the right to remain neutralin the event of war, and in the event of any member of the Commonwealth beinginvolved in the war; or that the Crown was not divisible; in other words, thatone member of the Commonwealth take South Africa as an example--would regard The King not only as King of South Africa and part of the Constitutionof South Africa, but would also regard him as King of England or other member-States of the Commonwealth. There was a difference of opinion with regard tothe interpretation. That difference was of a serious and important character.Parliament was called in to take a decision in connection with this matter and atthat time Parliament placed this interpretation upon it that there was no super-State either in name or in practice. This was a matter in regard to which there wasa serious difference of opinion in South Africa, as far as this interpretation was concerned. We have come a long way since those days. I do not think thereis any member in this House to-day, and I do hot think there is anyone whois acquainted with the facts, who still maintains that there is a super-State or that we have not got the right to remain neutral or the right to secede. Inthe meantime that right to secede has been exercised by Ireland and it is nowagain being exercised by India and no one denies their right to do so. Thereis no one to-day who adopts that attitude, and I must say that I was pleasantlysurprised to find at the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference that there was not a singlemember at that conference who still accepted that erroneous interpretation thatwas placed upon the Statute of Westminster.&apos;&apos; One and all emphasised that there is no super-State, that the Commonwealthcannot be described as a super-State and that those rights to which I have referredare part and parcel of the rights of every individual member of the Commonwealth.I was pleasantly surprised to learn this, but nevertheless, with a view to possiblemisunderstanding, I deemed it necessary to ask the Conference to put that inter-pretation in black and white. This resolution was then unanimously passed, that where the expression &quot; the King is head of the Commonwealth &quot; is used, it mustnot be interpreted to mean that it alters any of the existing rights of the various members of the Commonwealth, and that The King although he is indicatedas head of the Commonwealth fulfils no constitutional function as this. I feelthat the resolution that was adopted there has once and for all put this matterbeyond any doubt and that this position will never be misinterpreted again inthe future. I believe that this is the. first time that the position has been statedauthoritatively.&quot;* * * * * *&apos;&apos; I say that the solidarity of the Commonwealth has been tested and it hasstood the test. That has been demonstrated here in the clearest fashion. Thequestion arises why that is so ? That phenomenon and it is a noteworthy and important phenomenon requires an explanation. The only explanation I can give is that in the first place there are common interests between the various members of the Commonwealth, and it is in that light that they see the position.Furthermore, they have a common or general outlook on life. There are some members who are closer to each other than others, but politically they have acommon outlook; even in the case of India which is otherwise perhaps furthestremoved from the other members of the Commonwealth, she has decided to modelher constitution on the lines of the British constitution and our constitution inthis country. In other words, India will be a Republic but she will be a democratic republic and her method of parliamentary government will largely remain thesame as it was before. Moreover, as I have stated here before, India, like therest of the world, is to-day taking her stand with the anti-communist countries. She regards communism in Asia or communism which is trying to gain a foothold in India also, as a danger, just as we regard it as a danger.
Well there are common interests; there is a general, common outlook.   It was felt that the nations of the Commonwealth were standing together and that if at all possible they want to remain together. But the main reason, in my opinion,why the Commonwealth can remain together, in spite of the changes and develop-ments which have taken place, is that the Commonwealth has shown an ability to adapt itself to changing conditions in a changing World.   In other words, what i have said here implies that it respects freedom, not only freedom for all themembers jointly but freedom for every member as distinct from the Common-weaith.  It has the quality of adaptability.  We have seen that during our timein connection with South Africa as well.   In our younger days most of us livedin this country under the domination of an Empire a British Empire.   Thatmeant that the executive power was vested in one centre overseas.  The remainingcountries in the Empire were subject to the will and the domination of that one central authority.  But during our lifetime we have also seen the British Empiretransformed along peaceful constitutional lines into something else, a community of free independent nations, as far as the Dominions are concerned, linkedtogether by certain bonds, but where the one Dominion, either with regard toits domestic or with regard to its external interests, did not occupy a subordinateposition in relation to any other.   The British Empire had such a degree ofadaptability that it converted itself into something practically new.  That sameability to adapt itself to new conditions in a changing world has been revealedagain at this conference and in the decision taken there.  It has often been said-I believe my hon. friend oh the other side of the House has often emphasisedit in much stronger language that the British Empire is not an organisation;that there is no such thing as a British Empire except England and her colonies;that the Commonwealth is not an organisation; that it is a living organism anda living organism cannot continue to live unless it has the ability to adapt itselfto new circumstances.   And the fact that the Commonwealth has again shownthat it has the ability to adapt itself and has shown that it is not an organisationbut an organism, made it possible for it to exist - and to remain in existence inthe past; it makes it possible for it to remain in existence to-day.   If there hadbeen any rigidity in the basis of the Commonwealth it would have collapsed long ago.   This is a matter that must undoubtedly be taken into consideration in expressing an opinion with regard to the important step that was taken in this case.   In other words, let me put it this way : Where it has been necessary from time to time in the past to loosen the bonds holding the Commonwealthtogether, the Commonwealth has always succeeded in rising to the occasion. Whatdoes that prove to us ?  The step that was taken at the Conference goes to showthat what is described in the preamble to the Statute of Wesminster, namely,that the Commonwealth is based on a common allegiance, in other words, thatall the members must and in actual fact they do recognise the Crown and forma link with the Crown, is not the only bond holding the Commonwealth together.I go further and say that it is not even the most important bond holding theCommonwealth together.   I do not want to detract in any way from the valueof the bond, of common allegiance in certain cases.   I do not want to detract inany way from the importance of the role that The King plays in some member-countries of the Commonwealth; but I do want to say with regard to the Kingshipin England where The King is head of the State, where he is continually in touchwith his people, where he continually comes into contact with them and is inevery respect one of them, that the bond there differs from the bond elsewhere.I also want to concede that the Kingship in the case of some other member-countries of the Commonwealth is a unifying force.   I refer more particularly to those members of the Commonwealth with a homogeneous population and ahomogeneous population of British descent. I refer more particularly to Australiaand New Zealand.  I accept the fact that there the Kingship plays an importantrole in promoting unity.  But there are other member-countries of the Common-wealth that are in a different position.  I take South Africa by way of example.The population of South Africa is not uniform. South Africa has a history whichdiffers completely from the history of other members of the Commonwealth, andin these circumstances the Kingship cannot constitute the same bond of unity.I am not only referring to unity in relation to the world outside, but unity inthis country, within our own borders.   Oh the contrary, that link is frequentlymaintained at the expense of unity amongst your people.
&quot; That was the position in the case of Ireland. Ireland&apos;s circumstances were quite different from those of other States of the Commonwealth. For 700 yearsthey struggled for their freedom. They have their whole history behind them.This led to discord in Ireland and unity was only brought about in Ireland when she took the step that she eventually took and when she severed that link. Inthe case of India one found the same thing. Whilst that outside link existed,the link with the Crown, India was unable to achieve unity. I am not referringnow to India and Pakistan because there were other reasons that led to discordbetween them. But eventually India achieved unity again; I think this stepthat she has now at last taken in severing her link with the Crown has broughtunity to India. The only conclusion that I want to draw from that is thatthe link of common allegiance to the Crown is not the only bond holding theCommonwealth together. There are other bonds as well those I mentioned a mount ago which are stronger than the bond of Kingship, and I think thepresent trend of events has demonstrated that most clearly. I want to concludeon this note. What has been done in this case will not result in breaking up theCommonwealth; on the contrary, it will build up the Commonwealth; it willpreserve the unity and the power of the Commonwealth, and the impression thatthe world would have gained and undoubtedly did gain that the Commonwealthwas in the process of disintegrating is now being removed. The unity of theCommonwealth, and with it its strength and its power in the world, has been maintained and, in my opinion, strengthened.&quot; As far as South Africa is concerned, there have always been two schools of thought, not only in recent years, but for years and for generations, namely, the republican idea on the one hand, and the other conception, on the other hand,that we must be linked up with a nation overseas. We have failed to reconcilethose two standpoints ana we will not and cannot succeed in reconciling them.But I can say this with regard to these opposing standpoints, that my opinion has always been and I want to record it here that the greatest unity will beobtained in the case of South Africa, too, when we become a Republic.&apos;&apos; I want to add to what I have said on previous occasions that at the presentmoment there are other issues, important issues of vital importance to this countryin respect of which the population of this country English-speaking andAfrikaans-speaking and members of all parties hold the same view to a largeextent. These are urgent problems that must be solved and in order to be ableto do so, we must seek unity and stand together. But one thing is certain andthat is that the declaration issued at this Conference has brought us closer together than we have ever been before perhaps, as far as our different standpointswith regard to the constitutional position are concerned. There are some of us who are republicans; there are others who believe in the maintenance of the link with the Crown, but I make bold to say that in reference to one matter thatthat side of the House and this side of the House, all sections in South Africa,are agreed upon and that is that we want to remain in the Commonwealth if norestrictions are placed on our freedom; if our right of self-determination is not affected.JJ, Jf. &apos; -V*w -9? tv &apos;A? -Jv&quot; If a war breaks out in which we are threatened by the communistic danger,we shall be able to present a more united front than we have ever witnessed inthis country, but whatever the future of South Africa may be in the constitutionalsphere, however much we may differ with regard to the question of a Republic,or the retention of the link with the Crown, on one point we are now agreed and stand together, and that is that whatever the circumstances may be we wouldlike to remain in the Commonwealth for reasons that I have already indicated.$fa $fa $fa $f? $fa $faEXTRACTS FROM SPEECH BY FIELD-MARSHAL THE right on. J. C. SMUTS IN SOUTH AFRICAN HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY,11th MAY, 1949About the Declaration issued by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting in London on 27th April, 1949, General Smuts said : &quot; I find one part of that declaration very satisfactory; it is quite satisfactory as far as I am concerned. I am not satisfied with the arrangement that has beenmade with regard to India and I have given expression to my feeling about thataspect of the action that was taken at the conference.   But from a larger point of
.... &apos; . . .       - .view, with the exception of India, it may be said that that declaration is an affir-mation of the Statute of Westminster. Looking at the terms of this declaration,as I shall do in a moment, I find that there is no revolutionary departure, as Ifeared, from the position that was declared legally at the time when the Statute of westminster was passed both in London and There, and in other parts of the Com-commonwealth. The exception refers to India, but for the rest of the position remainsas it was. I should like just to refer to the Statute of Westminster to show whatwas the Commonwealth link as laid down in the Statute of Westminster, and Ishall then proceed to show that so far as the great bulk of the Commonwealth is-concerned, with the exception of India, no change has been made. The preamble to the Statute of Westminster states the case in these terms: &quot; &apos; The Crown is the symbol of the free association of the members of theBritish Commonwealth and they (i.e., the members) are united by a commonallegiance to the Crown.&apos;The Statute of Westminster therefore lays down as the basis, the foundation forour Commonwealth, two principles; the principle of free association, of which TheKing is the symbol in the Commonwealth; and the other, the common allegiance tothe Crown. That is our existing law, that is the existing position. Coming nowto this Declaration I have read it in order to see whether, apart from the case ofIndia, any change was made, and I find the situation remains identical to what itwas under the Statute of Westminster. The relevant part of&quot; this importantDeclaration reads : &quot; &apos; The Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, NewZealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Ceylon, whose countries areunited as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and owe alle-giance to the Crown, which is also a symbol of their free association, have considered the impending constitutional changes in India.&apos;It uses the very language, the very terminology of the Statute of Westminster.Then it refers to the exception that has been made for India and it goes on tosay-&quot; &apos; The Governments of other countries of the Commonwealth (i.e.,excepting India) the basis of whose membership is not hereby changed. . . .&apos;accept the position now with regard to India. It is therefore clear that follow-ing the documentary evidence, both the Statute of Westminster and theDeclaration now made, that the Prime Minister is absolutely correct in his state-ment that there is absolutely no change in the position here. The language of boththe preamble of the Statute of Westminster and of this Declaration are identicalin terms, leaving aside the exception in regard to India. I think that isimportant, because this consideration of the facts taking both the Statute of westminster and the new Declaration together show there is no revolutionarychange in regard to the constitution, the Basis of Commonwealth unity, the basisunder the two documents. In both cases it is a dual foundation that is given forthe Commonwealth. There is the free association of which The King is thesymbol, and there is the common allegiance to the Crown. These are the two points and they continue unaltered for the Commonwealth. Therefore with theexception of India there is no change whatever in the situation. The change ismade in regard to India and India alone.* * * * * *&quot; I have been critical of the way that India has been treated. The PrimeMinister has given a very elaborate and very illuminating exposition of the reason why India was dealt with in this way, why this exceptional treatment has been accorded to India. And one can understand that position quite fully. The worldposition to-day is such, the position of India is such, the strategic, the economic,and the political position of India in the world&apos;s structure is such that there musthave been almost overwhelming considerations in favour of giving her an excep-tional position which would still keep her within the ambit of the Commonwealth.I understand that we all appreciate that. What I feared was this; that theabolition of the common allegiance in the case of India would loosen the bondswhich keep us together. They are not bonds of subordination, none whatever.We all know that within our system we have the fullest liberty and freedom ofdevelopment, of self-determination, as the Prime Minister says. But even so, TheKing is something of a reality in our system, even if he does not exercise functions,
even if he has no executive power as head of the State he is something real, he isnot a mere nonentity, a mere symbol. There is something more, and that is duelargely to this common allegiance which the rest of us have retained. We do not want to make the concept of the Commonwealth something which is quite unreal,something which is merely symbolic, something which is merely a matter oflanguage and has nothing behind it. We have the case in history of the HolyRoman Empire, which continued to be called the Holy Roman Empire hundreds of years after it had ceased to exist, after it had become merely a name and therewas nothing else behind it. We are very anxious, all of us, to see that the Comrmonwealth does not degenerate to that position, that it becomes mere verbiage, a mere term with no real meaning behind it, and my fear has been, and it is ananxiety I still feel, that the disappearance, so far as India is concerned, of thecommon allegiance, does weaken the position very considerably. India doesremain as a member of the Commonwealth on the ground of free association, butthe other ground which holds for us she has abolished, and it does not apply to her.I am most anxious that it should not take place, this process of destroying bothbonds and that those two bonds which hold us together as a reality should notdisappear. I am very anxious that the exception which has been made in the caseof India should not become a precedent for other cases.tjtf *y- jt jl *v-vv &quot;7r -A* -/v&quot;&quot; I fully agree with what the Prime Minister has said, that we have growntogether. In the process of the years in spite of different points of view, in spiteof the different character of the various members of the Commonwealth, there hasbeen a growing together as an organism, and in a sense a greater feeling of unity and of strength which belongs to this system; and I should be very sorry to seeIndia the case which is quite exceptional used as a precedent and followed inother cases, too. I am pleased with and I acclaim the work the Prime minister has done. He must have felt like the other Prime Ministers there that the case foraccommodating India in the Commonwealth in some formula or another must havebeen overwhelming, and it has been done. It has been done quite cleverly by stillusing the language of the Statute of Westminster, the identical terms of theStatute of Westminster, without applying the Indian formula to the othermembers. We have now on record once more the confirmation of the position under the Statute of Westminster. I am glad of that. I think that is the realmeaning and significance of what has been done, that not only has an exceptionbeen made for India but the position for the rest, for the Commonwealth as awhole minus India, has remained absolutely identical. The same language hasbeen used as in the Statute of Westminster, and therefore there is no departure from that.&quot; The Prime Minister has referred to our case in South Africa. We must remember what is the position in South Africa, with its situation in the Common-wealth. I do not think it is a handicap on us that we are two European races inthis country. I think that is going to add to the stature of South Africa in thefuture. We are not a community embodying only one point of view, but we bringtogether different points of view, different traditions; and this mixture of the pastwith the future, this mixture of various elements we have brought into the commonpool, must lead to something greater, more distinguished and more unique in thefuture than has been the case in the past. There will never be anything common-place about South Africa, because it has brought together these strong virile races,and although we have passed through periods of contention I think those periods of contention have probably helped us to develop our strength and create a promisefor the future we otherwise would not have had.&apos;&apos; But look at our history, our constitutional history. We were two conqueredrepublics and two other old colonies and we came together in the South AfricaAct and formed the Union of South Africa. We accepted that bond of The Kingwhich now still holds our Commonwealth together to a very large extent. we came together under the Crown with the common allegiance. We came together in a legislative union on that basis. &apos; We formed a Parliament in which The Kingis a constituent element as set out in terms of the South Africa Act. Therefore,looking back at our whole history, not only the Statute of Westminster but manyyears before, we see how this bond has held us together and has been approved andacclaimed by all sections of our people. The South Africa Act without a doubt isthe grand bond that has held us together. It is the miracle that has happened inour country. We came together on that basis, and I think it will be a sorry dayif we should depart from the basis on which we became united then the common
allegiance, the kingship. Whatever our past may have been we accepted that. Onthat all South Africans were agreed and are still agreed, and we look upon theSouth Africa Act as a sacred document in our history and nothing ought to bedone which will destroy the value of that document for us.There has been this urge in us, at least among large sections of our people,in favour of the republic.&quot; And it is quite intelligible. Looking at the past of South Africa you canwell understand it, and I personally feel the strength of that sentiment, of thaturge, which is a great factor in our history. But, Mr. Chairman, we still comeback to this point that in spite of it all, in spite of the dual past, in spite of TheKing and the republic we came together, we accepted the situation in the SouthAfrica Act, and under the common allegiance we have been together now since1910. I do not think anything should be done to disturb that situation. It isnot a question of liberty. We can be just as free and we are just as free andsovereign a State with the kingship as we would be with a republic. It is not thequestion of liberty, it is a question of keeping the people of South Africa together on the lines on which they have developed and on which they have formed a state which has forged ahead and re-created this country and made something veryworth-while of our people.I therefore come to this point. The position is quite clear. There is no difference really in the exposition which the Prime Minister has made of the con-stitutional position from the view which I myself hold and which I have been trying to explain to the Committee. We have now to consider the question of thefuture and I do think that it is just and fair that the Prime Minister should tellus about the future and what the policy of his party is.^ ^* , .- $fc&apos;-&quot; Let us deal with the problems which face this country at the present timeand that will trouble our country for years to come. That is the point I want to urge. I do not think that there is very much difference between the expositionwhich has been given by the Prime Minister and myself about the whole positionin the Commonwealth, but I do ask him and his party to realise how difficultthe situation becomes for us if we go back on what we have done in the pastin the South Africa Act, in the Statute of Westminster, and what we have donenow again in London in the declaration which affects the Statute of Westminster.I want us to reflect how much harm we can do to this country and how muchwe can distract the attention of the people in this country from the practical problems which really ought to receive our most concentrated attention andhandling. I would therefore ask the Prime&quot; Minister, if possible, to make adeclaration which will ease the situation in this country and make it possible for people wholeheartedly to work together in the years to come. We must treatIndia&apos;s case as something apart; not as an example to follow. We have a situationnow which will demand all our strength in this country and I hope we shallconcentrate on that situation.&quot;APPENDIX IVSPEECH BY PANDIT NEHRU, PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA, in indian CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ON 16th MAY, 1949, as reported BY THE HINDUSTAN TIMES ON 17th MAY, 1949Pandit Nehru said : &quot; I have the honour to move the following motion:--i&apos;&apos; Resolved that this Assembly do hereby ratify the declaration, agreedto by the Prime Minister of India, on the continued membership of indian the Commonwealth of Nations, as set out in the official statement issued at the conclusion of the Conference of the Commonwealth Prime ministers in London on 27th April, 1949.&quot;Commending the decision to the House, Pandit Nehru said : &quot; If we aredissociated from the Commonwealth, for the moment we are completelyisolated. We cannot remain completely isolated and so, inevitably, by stressof circumstances we have to incline in some direction or other.  That inclination
in some direction or other will necessarily be a give-and-take affair. In other words, it will involve commitments far more than there are now. Therefore, inthat sense, we are freer to-day to come to friendly understandings with othercountries and to play the part of a bridge for mutual understanding betweenother countries.&quot;Pandit Nehru said he had been often asked, &quot; How can you join a Common-wealth in which there is racial discrimination and there are other thingshappening to which we object ? &quot; He admitted that this was a fair question andwas a matter which necessarily must cause &quot;some trouble in our thinking.&quot;Nevertheless, it was a question which did not really arise. &quot; When we have an alliance with a nation or with a group of nations,&quot; Pandit Nehru explained,&apos;&apos; it does not mean that we accept their other policies. It does not mean that wecommit ourselves in any way to something that they may do. In fact, ourcountrymen are carrying on at the present moment a struggle in regard to racial discrimination in various parts of the world. One of the major questions beforethe United Nations at the instance of India has been the position of Indians inSouth Africa, and may I for a moment refer to the passing of a resolution at theUnited Nations General Assembly yesterday and express my appreciation and myGovernments appreciation of the way our delegation has functioned, and our appreciation of all those nations of the United Nations almost all, in fact, barringSouth Africa which finally supported this attitude of India? .&apos;Foreign Policy&apos;&apos; Now one of the pillars of our foreign policy, repeatedly stated, is to fight against racial discrimination and to fight for the freedom of suppressednationalities. Are we compromising on that issue by remaining in the Common-wealth? We have been fighting on the South African-Indian issue and on other issues even though we have been a dominion of the Commonwealth. But it wouldhave been a dangerous thing for us to bring that matter within the purview ofthe Commonwealth, because then that very thing to which you and I object mighthave taken place, i.e., the Commonwealth might have been considered some kindof a superior body which judges and which sometimes acts as a tribunal or in a sense supervises the activities of its member nations. It certainly would havemeant, a diminution in our independence and sovereignty if we accepted that principle. Therefore, we were not prepared and we are not prepared to treat the Commonwealth as such or even to bring the disputes between member nations of the Commonwealth before that Commonwealth body.&quot; We may, of course, in a friendly way discuss these matters. That is adifferent matter, but we are anxious to maintain the absolute independence of our country and of other countries in the Commonwealth.&quot; If we are to adopt the attitude that we are not going to associate ourselves with a country because we disapprove of certain policies of that country, then there would be hardly any association for us with any country because we maywell disapprove of something or other that that country does. Sometimes it sohappens that the difference is so great that you cut off relations with a country or there is a big conflict. But you cannot argue that because you do not agree witheverything that the Soviet Union does you cannot have representation there or that you cannot have a treaty with the United States because you do not agreewith some of its policies. That is not the way nations carry on their foreign work or any work.&quot; We join the Commonwealth obviously because we think it is beneficial tous and to other causes in the world that we wish to advance. Other countries ofthe Commonwealth want us to remain there because they think it is beneficial tothem. It is mutually understood that it is to the advantage of the nations in theCommonwealth and, therefore, they join, but at the same time it is made perfectly clear that each country goes its own way. It may be that that way sometimes goesso far as to make the Commonwealth link break. Well, then it breaks and therethe matter ends.&quot; But in the world of to-day, where there are so many disruptive forcesat work, where sometimes we are often at the verge of war, I think it is nota thing to be encouraged to break up any association with anyone. Break up the evil parts of it, break up anything that may come in the way of your growth,but otherwise, it is better to keep a co-operative association going which might do good in this world rather than bad.
&quot; This declaration is no new move. It is a complete reorientation of some-thing that has existed in an entirely different way, -Suppose we had been cutoff from England completely and we had then desired to join the Commonwealth,it would have been a new move. Suppose a new group of nations wants us tcjoin them and we joined them, that would have been a new move from whichvarious consequences would have flowed. In the present instance, a certainassociation has been existing for a considerable time past. A very great changecame in the way of that association on 15th August, 1947. Now another major change is contemplated. Gradually the conception is changing, yet that certainlink remains in a different form.&quot;Referring to the discussions that preceded the signing of the declaration,Pandit Nehru said : &quot; I am afraid I am a bad bargainer. I am not used to the ways of the market place. I hope I am a good fighter and I hope I am a goodfriend. I am anything in between. And so, when you have to bargain hardfor anything, do not send me.&quot; I think it is far better to gain the goodwill of the other party, to cometo a decision in friendship and goodwill, than to gain a word here or there at thecost of ill-will. So I approached the problem in this spirit. The Prime Ministersalso approached it in that spirit. It is possible that if I had tried my hardest,I might have got a word here or there changed but the essence of the declara-tion could not have been changed because there was nothing more for us to get out of the declaration.India&apos;s Approach&apos;&apos; I preferred not to do so because I preferred creating an impression and I hope a right impression that the approach of India to these and other problems of the world was not a narrow-minded approach but was an approachbased on faith and confidence and strength in her own future and, therefore,India was not afraid of any country coming in the way of that future. Theworld was interested how this very knotty and difficult problem which appearedinsoluble could be solved.&quot; It could not be solved if we left it to eminent lawyers. Lawyers have their use in life but they should not be spread out everywhere (Laughter). Itcould hot have been solved by extreme narrow-minded nationalists who cannot see to the right or to the left and who live in a narrow sphere of their own and,therefore, forget that the world is going ahead. It could not have been solved by people who lived in the past and could not realise that the present is different from the past and the future is going to be still more different. It could nothave been solved by any person who lacked faith in India and in India&apos;s destiny.&quot; I wanted the world to see that India did not lack faith in herself, that india was prepared to co-operate even with those with whom we had beenfighting in the past, provided the basis of co-operation to-day was an honourablebasis, was a free basis, and a basis which might lead to the good not only of our-selves but of the world. That is to say, we would not deny that co-operation,simply because in the past we had had to fight and thus carry this trail of ourpast karma along with us.   We had to wash out that past with all its evil.Past Pledges&quot; As I sat there at the Conference table, I remembered that day, when19 years ago, we took a pledge on the banks of the Ravi at a midnight hourand I remembered the pledge repeated year after year on 26th January, inspite of difficulty and obstruction. And I remembered that day when, standingat this very place, I placed before this House the Objectives resolution. Twoyears and five months have elapsed since that happened.&quot; In that resolution, we defined more or less the type of free Government orRepublic that we are going to have. Later, this subject came up at the Jaipursession of the Congress. Not only my mind but many minds were struggling withthis problem, trying to find a way out that was in keeping with the honour anddignity and independence of India and yet also in keeping with the changingworld and the facts as they were, something that would advance the cause ofIndia and the cause of peace in the world and yet something which would be strictly and absolutely true to every single pledge that we had taken.
&quot; It was clear to me that whatever the advantages might be of any associa-tion with the Commonwealth or with any other group, no single advantage,however great, could be purchased by a single iota of our pledges being given up, because no country can make progress by playing fast and loose with theprinciples which it has declared. I stand before you to say in all humility thatI have fulfilled that mandate to the letter (cheers).&apos;&apos; All of us have for many years passed through the valley of the shadow.We have passed our lives in struggle, sometimes failure, sometimes success, andall of us have been haunted by the dreams and visions of those days, the hopes that filled us and the frustrations that often followed those hopes. Yet we have seen that even out of the prickly thorn of frustration and despair, we have beenable to pick up the rose of fulfilment. So let us not be led away by considering a situation in terms of events which are no longer there.Touch of Healing&apos;&apos; The value I would like this House to attach to this declaration is that it isa method which brings a touch of healing with it. In this world which is sosick and which has not recovered from so many deep wounds caused during thelast decade or more, it is necessary that we touch upon the world&apos;s problemsnot with passion and prejudice and with too much&apos; repetition of what has ceased to be but in a friendly way and with a touch of healing. I think the chief valueof this declaration and what preceded it was that it did bring a touch of healingin our relations with certain countries. We are in no way subordinate to themand they are in no way subordinate to us. We shall go our way and they shallgo their way. But our ways unless something happens will be friendly ways.At any rate, attempts will be made to understand each other, to be friends with each other and to co-operate with each other and the fact that we have begunthis new type of association with a touch of healing will be good for us and goodfor them and, I think, good for the world.&quot;   (Loud cheers.)Features of the DeclarationAPandit Nehru asked the House to notice that in the first paragraph of thedeclaration, dealing with the present position, the Commonwealth was referredto as the British Commonwealth of Nations. In subsequent paragraphs, how-ever, it was described as the Commonwealth of Nations. Further, while in thefirst paragraph there was the question of allegiance to the Crown, which existedat present, subsequently there was a reference to The King as the symbol of thatassociation. The reference was to The King and not the Crown. It was a smallmatter but it had a certain small significance.So far as the Republic of India was concerned, she had nothing to do withany external authority or with any King and none of its citizens would owe anyallegiance to The King or to any other external authority.He was placing the declaration for the approval of the House but therewas no question of any law being framed in accordance with it. There was nolaw behind the Commonwealth itself, not even possibly the formality which accompanied normal treaties. It was an agreement hy free will to be terminatedat free will.It had been made perfectly clear that The King had no functions at all. Hehad a, certain status but the Commonwealth itself as such had no body, it had noorganisation to function and The King also could have no functions. Therewere hardly any obligations in the nature of commitments. An attempt had beenmade to produce something which was entirely novel. There was absolutelynothing behind the declaration except what was placed before the House.Nature of CommonwealthOne of the objects of this kind of Commonwealth association was to create a status which was something between being completely foreign and being of onenationality. Obviously, Commonwealth countries belonged to different nations,they were independent and there were independent nationalities.   Normally,
either they had a common nationality or they were foreign. There was no inter-mediate stage. Up till now, in the British Commonwealth of Nations, there wasa binding link which was allegiance to The King. That would snap when Indiabecame a Republic.&quot;If we desire to give a certain preference or a certain privilege mutuallyby treaty to any one of those countries,&quot; said Pandit Nehru, &quot;we would normally be precluded from doing so because of the most-favoured-nation clause, that is,that country would be as much foreign as any other country. We wanted to takeaway that foreignness, keeping in our own hands what, if any, privilege orpreference we should give to any other country in the Commonwealth.&quot; I do not know how we shall proceed to deal with the matter. It willbe for this House to decide at a later stage. At one time there was talk of a commonwealth citizenship. It was difficult to understand what the contents of a commonwealth citizenship might be, except again that we would not be completelyforeign to one another. There is no longer any consideration of that business andI think it is as well that we left off talking about something which could not be easily denned. But the other fact remains, the fact that we could take the rightto ourselves, if we so chose, to enter into treaties or arrangements with theCommonwealth countries assuring certain mutual privileges and preferences.&quot;SPEECH BY PANDIT NEHRU, PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA, in indian CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ON 17th MAY, 1949, as reported BY THE HINDUSTAN TIMES ON 18th MAY, 1949The Prime Minister, replying to the debate, appealed to his critics not to look at the question in a party spirit.&quot;I think,&quot; he said, &quot; it should be possible for people who differ considerably in regard to internal policy to have more or less a unified foreign policy. It is exceedingly difficult to have any common approach about anything with thoseindividuals or groups who think&quot; in terms of other countries and not of India atall as the primary thing. But, with people who think in terms of India&apos;s inde-pendence and progress, there should be no great difference in our foreign policy.&quot;:. Pandit Nehru said that the London decision fulfilled and did not go against&quot; any pledges of ours.&quot; It did not come in the way of India going forward toher natural destiny of a sovereign independent republic. Indian freedom, and independence were in no way touched. The republic that the House had decided upon would come into existence without any commitment which might tie it downin any way.&quot; We would have achieved that, of course, in any event,&quot; Pandit Nehruadded, &apos;&apos; but we have achieved that with the goodwill of many others. To achieveit with the goodwill of others, who perhaps are hit by it, is some achieve-ment. It shows that the manner of doing things is a manner which does not leave a trace of evil, hatred, bitterness or ill-will behind. On the other hand, it startswith a fund of goodwill, and goodwill is always precious from any quarter.Therefore, I had the sensation, when I was considering this matter in London,that in a small measure perhaps I had done something that would have met withthe approval of Gandhiji. I am thinking more of the manner of it than of the thing done.&quot;Two TestsOne of the tests by which the decision should be judged was whether it helpedor hindered India in making rapid progress. India had, in a sense, solved thepolitical problem but was faced with many economic difficulties. They were herdomestic concern, no doubt, but the world could help or hinder any policy thatshe might adopt. &quot;Iam prepared to go ahead even without external help,&quot; hesaid, &quot; but obviously it will be a far more difficult task and it will take a much longer time. During these critical years that face us it is important that we make good economically as we have done politically. We have to see whetherthe London decision generally helps us to gain strength and to build ourselvesup in the near future or not.&quot;
Another test, Pandit Nehru said, was whether in the world, as it was to-day,it helped in the promotion of peace and the avoidance of war. No Governmentdare allow its country to be unprepared for contingencies. &quot; We have to prepareourselves, unfortunately,&quot; he added, &quot; unless we are brave enough to followcompletely the policy that the Mahatma laid down. But it is not so much aquestion of my being brave or your being brave but of the country being braveenough to follow and understand that policy. I do not think we have been brought up to that level of understanding and behaviour and, indeed, we talk about thatgreat level when in the last year and a half we have seen the lowest depths ofbehaviour in this country.  So let us not take his name in vain in this connection.&quot; Nevertheless, I think that in a sense India is partly suited to contribute to peace because, in spite of our being rather feeble and rather unworthy followersof Gandhiji, we have imbibed to some slight extent what he told us.      :     ^&quot;I do submit that what we have done in no way, negatively speaking,injures us or can injure us. Positively, we haye achieved politically what we wanted and we are likely to have more opportunities of progress in this waythan otherwise we would have had in the next few years, and, finally, in the worldcontext, it is something that encourages and helps peace to some extent.&quot;Fight against EvilPandit Nehru pointed out that the&apos; London decision in no way bound this or any other country. It was open to the present House or the next parliament at any time to break the link if it chose not that he wanted that link to be broken, but he was merely pointing out that the future had not been bound downin the slightest degree.Some members of the House and some outside the House had opposed hismotion, he said. &quot; They have been totally unable to come out of that cage ofthe past in which all of us had lived, even though the door was open for themmentally to come out. Some of our friends have been good enough to quote from my speeches delivered fifteen or twenty years ago. If they attached so muchvalue to my speeches, they might have listened to my present speeches a little morea carefully. (Laughter.) The world has changed. Evil still remains evil and goodis good. Imperialism is an evil thing and wherever it remains it has to be rooted,out. Colonialism is an evil thing and wherever it remains it has to be rootedout.   Racialism is an evil and has to be fought.   All that is true.&quot;If you talk about British imperialism and the rest to-day, I do not saythat you are 100 per cent.-wrong because there is a bit of it left, but fundamentallyyou are wrong, because there is no capacity for imperialism, even if the Willwas there. It simply cannot be done. The French are acting imperialistically in parts of Asia. They may, but the fact remains that their capacity for doing itis over. They may carry on for a year or two. The Dutch may do it elsewhere,but if you look at it in the historical way, all these things are hangovers of something given up. Essentially, that particular aspect cannot be done becausethey have no strength behind them to do. It may last even a few years and,therefore, we have to combat it and to be vigilant, but let us not think as if Europeor England were the same as it were fifteen or thirty years ago. It is not. Norare we. We have to look at these problems in a big way. If we are a big nationin size, that will not bring bigness to us unless we are big in mind and heart and understanding and action also.&quot; You can take if from me that you may perhaps gain a little here and therewith your bargainers and hagglers of the market place, but if you act in a bigway the response to\you is very big from the world. Good always draws, goodfrom others and a big action which shows generosity of spirit brings generosityfrom the other side.&quot;I, therefore, commend this resolution to the House and hope that it willnot only approve it but accept it as a harbinger of good relations, of our acting in a generous way towards other countries^ and towards the world and thusstrengthening ourselves and strengthening the cause of peace.&quot; (Loud and prolonged cheers.)
APPENDIX VEXTRACT FROM A BROADCAST TALK BY THE HON. Mr. LIAQUATALI KHAN, PRIME MINISTER OF PAKISTAN, ON 25th MAY, 1949The object of the Commonwealth Premiers&apos; Conference recently held in ,London was to consider the constitutional changes which India wanted to bringabout&quot;in her constitution vis-a-v&apos;is her relations with the Commonwealth. TheIndian Constituent Assembly some time back had decided that the future constitution of India would be on a republican basis. The Government of Indiaalso informed the British Government that in spite of India becoming a Republicshe did not desire to break her relations with the Commonwealth. The Conferenceof Commonwealth Premiers was thus called to consider this issue and its decisions are fully known to you. But these decisions are viewed by some people with grave doubts and misgivings and it is necessary for me to explain their significance in greater details.It is not possible in this brief talk to throw light on the successive events which brought into existence the Commonwealth. It is equally impossible to statehow the British Empire, which, on behalf of England, dominated over othercountries forcibly, gradually came to assume the form of the Commonwealth asit exists to-day. At this stage it is necessary to stress that all the members ofthe Commonwealth are completely independent in their internal as well asexternal affairs. In fact, the unity of purpose which has been agreed upon by-all the Commonwealth countries is based on those very ideals which the united nations have set before them. These ideals are to further peace, prosperity and progress in the world and to remove differences likely to arise between various countries by peaceful means so that more friendly relations may.be establishedamong them. No member-country of the Commonwealth is either subordinate ofor dependent upon any other competent member, nor does it acknowledge any responsibility which it has not voluntarily accepted.In this Conference it was agreed to let India shap6 its relations with &quot;theCommonwealth on a different footing, viz., to break its constitutional relationwith The King of England. But India at the same time would continue to remain as before a member of the Commonwealth on the basis that the British King isthe symbol of the unity of the Commonwealth. In other words, India remainingas a Republic has accepted The King as a symbol of unity as well as the Headof the Commonwealth. It was clearly stated in this conference that Pakistancould, if it wanted, change its relations towards the Commonwealth in the same way as India has done.Now there are three courses open to Pakistan. Firstly, to continue its existing relations with the Commonwealth; secondly, to reshape its constitutionalrelations with the Commonwealth in the same way as India has done; and,thirdly, that it may sever all connections with the Commonwealth. The ConstituentAssembly of Pakistan, which is drafting the future constitution of our country,is fully competent to adopt any of the three courses stated above. The ConstituentAssembly is the representative body of the people of Pakistan and as such hasfull liberty to take a decision on this issue. It was on this very ground that i expressed my satisfaction over the decision of the Commonwealth Conference.In view of our being in a position to adopt whichever course we like, I fail to see the basis for any misunderstanding. The Government of Pakistan, ormyself while in England, have not made any commitment binding the ConstituentAssembly in any way. On the contrary, it has been clearly stated that theConstituent Assembly of Pakistan can take whatever decision it chooses.This time when I was in England I had occasion to meet many political leaders, proprietors and representatives of newspapers and other leadingpersonalities. As a result of these meetings, I gathered that most of the people in England believed that, whatever shape events might take, Pakistani relationwith Great Britain would remain unchanged. Therefore, I considered it necessaryto point out to those who held this view that they were entirely mistaken andthat Pakistan could not rest content with mere words, unless those who professedfriendship with her gave practical proof of their sincerity. Pakistanisincerity towards her friends was genuine and therefore she expected to be paidback in the same coin by those who sought her friendship.
