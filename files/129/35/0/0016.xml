Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (49) 12624th&quot; May, 1949CABINETSCIENTIFIC policy note by the Prime minister wish to remind my colleagues of the arrangements which have been madefor making advice on scientific policy available to the Government.2. The Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was set up in accordance withthe recommendations in the second report of the Committee on Future scientific policy, dated 16th October, 1946, with the following terms of reference :-&quot; To advise the Lord President of the Council in the exercise of his responsibilities for the formulation and execution of Government scientific policy.&quot;3. The Defence Research Policy Committee was set up by a decision of theDefence Committee at their meeting on 5th July, 1946 (D.O. (46) 21st Meeting,Minute 1), and its terms of reference were amended on the establishment of theMinistry of Defence to read : -&quot; To advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters connected with the formulation of scientific policy in the defence field.&quot;.4. These two bodies are under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Tizard and both have done much useful work in securing the greater assistance of science inthe solution of our civil and military problems. I would ask my colleagues to review the extent to which their Departments have availed themselves of this machinery and to take steps to ensure that policy matters having a scientificaspect, and especially all major questions of scientific organisation in Government,are referred whenever necessary for the advice of the appropriate one of thesetwo scientific bodies. In any case of doubt Ministers ought not to hesitate to consult Sir Henry Tizard personally.C. R: A.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,24th May, 1949.37079
