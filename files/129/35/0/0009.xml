S E C R E Tr:. ?. (u10) 119gj-j-TH MAY,  19^-9CAB INETHONG Kong memorandum by the Prime minister on 5th May the Cabinet authorised the despatch to hong Kpng of reinforcements sufficient to secure the Colonyagainst internal unrest t sporadic attacks by guerillas.They were, however, unwilling that this decision should be announced in terms implying a long-term policy of maintainingHong Kong as a British Colony.      This unwillingness was basedpartly on military advice that Hong Kong could not be success-fully defended against a full-scale attack, by a first-classPower, and partly on the knowledge that public opinion inother countries (including some of the Commonwealth countries)would be unfavourably impressed by any declaration of our intention to hold Hong Kong indefinitely as a Colonialpossession (CM. (i+9) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 2).The decision to send these reinforcements was announced by the Minister of Defence, in debate in the Houseof Commons on 5th May, in the following terms:-&quot;While, as I have made clear, we havescrupulously endeavoured to avoid being involved in thewar on the&apos; Chinese mainland, we are no less resolute inour attitude as regards territory for which we hold adirect responsibility.      Hong Kong has long had atradition of neutrality and non-interference in thepolitics of China, and supporters of the Kuomintangregime and the Communists alike have enjoyed the benefits which have thus been provided, subject to their obeyingthe law and doing nothing to damage relations between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of China.His Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently maintained apolicy of strict non-interference in the civil war inChina, and, in pursuance of this policy, a very vigilantwatch is being kept in Hong Kong, and steps have been,and are being, taken to deal with any breach of theconditions under which Chinese nationals, whetherKuomintang or Communist, are allowed to reside there andwith disturbance of the peace, however caused.      It wouldnot be in the public interest to give details at thisstage. &quot;........&apos;.............&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to take further measures for the protection of Hong Kong.      Itshould be clearly understood that in reaching thisdecision His Majesty&apos;s Government have been moved solely by the desire and determination to prevent the presentunsettled conditions in China from endangering the welfare and safety of the people of Hong Kong, or hampering the peaceful pursuit of legitimate trade through Hong Kongwith China.      Towards-this end, substantial reinforce- ^ments to the garrison are accordingly being sent and will include elements of all arms - land,   sea and air.&quot;.........COPY NO.-1-iil3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

2. Since then the Communist forces in Southern China havemade substantial progress, and the risk of an armed attack againstHong Kong has increased.      The Chiefs of Staff have advised thatthe threat of such an attack may develop at any time after theend of September next and that,  if it is to be resisted, weshould be ready to meet it from the beginning of September.The Chiefs of Staff have also advised that it should be possiblesuccessfully to repel such an attack if it is decided now tosend to Hong Kong the further reinforcements described in thememorandum by the Minister of Defence (C. P. (k10)  118).3. Together with the Ministers most directly concerned Ihave discussed this situation with the Chiefs of Staff, theCommissioner-General for South East Asia and the Comrrkmders-in-Chief of the Land and Air Forces in the Par East.      The military implications are discussed in the paper submitted by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (1-1-9) 118).      My paper is concerned with thepolitical considerations;    and the proposals in the following paragraphs are put forward after consultation with the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relation;;,h. All the advice that we have received from the authori-ties on the spot is that any failure on our part to meet this threat to the security of Hong Kong will damage very seriouslyBritish prestige throughout the Far East arid South East Asia.The peoples of this area remember clearly how Hong Kong was over-run by the Japanese in the last war;    and,  unless they are con-vinced of our determination and ability to resist this new threat to Hong Kong, the whole common front against Communism in SouthEast Asia, and especially in Slam and Burma,  is likely to crumble..0h the other hand, a clear indication of our determination to resist such an attack might well succeed in deterring the communists from making the attempt.In the light of the views expressed in the Cabinet&apos;sjrlier discussions,  I have considered with the Foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations&quot;how best wecan present to world opinion a decision to defend Hong Kongagainst such an attack.      We are agreed in recommending that thisshould be presented as a decision to resist aggression.&quot;      Theright to resist aggression, wherever it may occur, is clearlyrecognised in the United Nations Charter and I therefore proposethat we should base on this right our determination to resistaggression against Hong Kong.      If the Communists decide to stagean attack, on Hong Kong, we should then be in a position to appealto the Security Council of the United Nations, and would beentitled to the support of the nations who are signatories of the charter.      I do not look to the United Nations for any materialsupport - the Soviet Union would certainly veto any resolutionfor remedial action - but I base my proposal on the fact that theUnited Nations Organisation offers the best opportunity ofmobilising world opinion and in particular our friends in supportof our resistance to aggression.Approach to other Commonwealth Countries and the United States.6. Immediately the decision has been taken to send thenecessary reinforcements to Hong Kong and to resist Communistaggression by armed, force should it take place, we should notify the other members of the Commonwealth and the United States ofour decision and of the basis upon which it rests.      The factthat this decision is in accordance with the terms of the united nations Charter should, we hope,  commend itself to those powervho attach importance to the United Nations Organisation and *yyit stands for.

7. V/e should be able to obtain strong statements of support from at least the majority of the other commonwealth prime Ministers,,      It would be important,, particularly inrelation to the older Commonwealth countries, that we shouldmake clear our intentions of defending Hong Kong and our ability to do so.      If they are to be asked to support our policy by public statements, they must know exactly what the full irnpli-cations of that policy are.      The attitude of the differentmembers of the Commonwealth varies and it may be convenient todeal with the countries individually.8. Australia and Hew Zealand.      Australia and NewZealand are the Commonwealth countries most directly affected and. incidentally are the only ones who are likely to be able and willing to send material help at an early stage.      They would feel that their own security was directly threatened by theloss of Kong Kong and both are likely to support a robust policy on our part.      The Prime Minister of New Zealand has already sent a message .saying that the possible fate of Hong Kong is amatter of immediate moment.      He has said that a second expul-sion from this area at this particular time could not fail tohave tlie most damaging consequences and he has asked to beinformed of the present position and of the plans which havebeen drawn up for the effective defence of Hong Kong.      our high Commissioner at Canberra has also reported that the generalcomment in Australia has been that Australia is vitally con-cerned in the retention of Hong Kong and must support a firmUnited. Kingdom policy there.      At the same time there is inAustralia the background of Malaya in the last war with the arrival of the Australian troops in time to become Japaneseprisoners of war.      Our High Commissioners in Canberra andWellington have already been asked, to communicate the apprecia-tion in C. P. (49)  100 to the Australian and. New Zealand G-overn-rnent s.      It is  recommended that this should now be followed upby an early approach to the Prime Ministers of Australia and NewZealand., lotting them know fully the considerations of policy-set out above and informing them of trie action we ourselvespropose to take by way of further military reinforcements.      Inthis approach we would seek their support for our general policy,-with a view to making, at the appropriate moment, any requests for material assistance which are recommended in the separate paper which is being submitt ed by the Minister of Defence.9. Canada and South Africa..      The general attitude ofCanada and South Africa to a policy on the lines proposed islikely to be similar to that of Australia and New Zealand, thoughboth Canada and South Africa are less directly affected and, for different  reasons, would not be likely to send material help.Both are, however,  likely to support a policy of resistance to aggresion and both would be powerfully impressed by the need to resist the Communist threat.     It may be hoped therefore that both Canada and. Couth ^friea would give strong moral support toour -policy.10. There is a particular consideration, however,  in thecase of Canada.      The fate of Canadian troops in Hong Kong inthe last war has still not been forgotten and this remains a subject of controversy in the Canadian Parliament, whereMr.  Drew, the Loader of the Opposition, has been at pains tokeep t-he issue alive.      The Canadian General Election is due on27th. June and the Canadian Government may be reluctant to make-any public statement while electioneering is still on.      On theother hand,  if the United States were to agree to support our policy, Canada would find it much easier to do so.

1 -]. India.      The attitude of India is crucial in thismatter.      If we could be assured of India&apos;s moral supportopenly expressed by Pandit Nehru, the effect must be important.On the other hand, refusal on his part to endorse our policy,with, or indeed without, any overt statement, would be highly dangerous, in relation to Hong Kong and the situation in SouthEast Asia generally.      It may be difficult to obtain any public declaration of support from Pandit Nehru in view of his per-Bistent attacks on &quot;Colonialism&quot;, of his frequently repeatedannouncements of neutrality and of his refusal to join up with either an Eastern or a Western bloc, but we should clearly make every effort.     Sir Archibald Nye has boon asked to come toLondon for consultation as to the best way of making an approach to the Government of India and it is hoped that he will be ableto handle the matter personally with Pandit Nehru on his return.12* Pakistan and Ceylon.      Similar considerations to thoseaffecting India apply also to Pakistan and Ceylon and the actionto be taken in relation to them would follow on that taken inthe case, of India.13* United States.      It is not possible to estimateaccurately what United States reactions will be to a request for moral support of a policy of defending Hong Kong against aggression.      In the past American opinion, swayed to a largeextent by sentiment and by the large missionary element in american contacts wit?:. China, tended to be sympathetic to theview that Hong Kong should be returned to China.      The growingmenace of Soviet Russia and the Communist - advance in China have,it is believed, modified American opinion,  and the United StatesGovernment may He prepared to afford moral support to a short-term policy of resisting aggression against Hong Kong as partof the general resistance to trie advance of Communism which theyfavour.      A message  should be sent to the United States stressingthis aspect of the situation as well as the fact that our decision is in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.It Is doubtful whether the United States would be prepared tofurnish material support for Hong Kong, but the message might include a request to the United States to consider whether theywould be willing to fill the gaps which will be created inGermany (and possibly also in. Japan) by a decision to send to hong Kong some Commonwealth elements from the forces ofoccupation in those countries.Summary of Recommendations.My recommendations to the Cabinet may be summarised asWe should now decide to defend Kong Kong- against armed attack by Chinese Communist forces.This decision should be presented as resistance to aggresion in accordance with the United nations charter.We should see!-, moral support for this policy from all theother Commonwealth countries and from the United States.We should also ask, at the appropriate moment, formaterial assistance from Australia and hew Zealand onthe linos recommended by the Minister of Defence in-C. P.-(49.) 11S*We should ask the United States Government to considerwhether they would be willing to fill the gaps created in Germany (and possibly Japan) by the withdrawal of commonwealth troops for the defence of Hong Kong.O. i\. ii.14.follows:-(a)00(c)(d)(e)Downing Street.
