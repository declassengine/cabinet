On the Sunday itself, the Railway Executiveissued the attached statement (Annex A).      This explains why they had not previously expressed views in public and goes onto set out the Railway Executive&apos;s case.      It was augmented bya note (Annex B), explaining, the significance of lodging-turnsand the history of the&apos; dispute.This statement and the accompanj^ing note were well. were extensively used.

This the Union were unwilling to do, and on Tuesday, in order to assist in thesettlement of the&quot; dispute, the Railway Executive proposed tothe II. TJ. R.  and to the other Unions representing railway workersdiscussions on the lower-paid grades, without insisting on the prior withdrawal of the 10s. Od claim.      The Unions have responded to this overture, and talks on this new basis will now proceed,without prejudice to the original claim. -To complete the picture I should remind my colleagues of the &quot;go slow&quot; movement at London Road, Manchester, NineElms, and Southwark.      These stoppages took place without warning, and the N. U. R.  was asked to deal with them.

SUNDAY.RAIL STOPPAGE:RAILWAY EXECUTIVESTATEMENTThe Railway Executive greatly regret the inconvenience and delay which has been caused to the travelling public in the Eastern and North Eastern regions of British Railways today (Sunday), by a large number ofdrivers and firemen not reporting for duty.At a meeting between the Railway Executive andthe Union leaders on Thursday last ( 26th May), an assurance was given that the Unions would advise their members totake duty on Sunday, but this has unfortunately been ignored,In previous statements on this subject, thoRailway Executive have been most anxious to ovoid anyexpression of fact or comment which might prejudicenegotiations or which might hamper the Unions in theirdealings with their members.     In view of what hastranspired this weekend, however, the Railway Executiveconsider it only fair to the travelling public that theyshould be made aware of the following facts in connectionwith the refusal of certain enginemen in the North eastern and Eastern Regions to undertake &quot;lodging turns&quot;, which isthe cause of the irregular stoppage of Sunday work:-1.   The working of &quot;lodging&apos; turns&quot; is a long-establishedfeature of main line railway practice, recognised and confirmed by Notional Agreement between theformer railway companies and the trade unions.2.    It is essential to the efficient and economicalworking of long-distance railway traffic,  and isparticularly important at the present time whenBritish Railways are striving to restore pre-warstandards of service and to provide the mostcomfortable travel for passengers and the mostexpeditious transit of freight.ANNEX    &apos;A&apos;

3. Lodging turns affect only a small proportion ofthe staff and are not in any way excessive intheir frequency.     (Out of 5,1+30 drivers and firemen at 12 depots concerned with expressservices on the King&apos;s Cross and Edinburgh route,only 96 men, or 1.8jo, are involved in lodging.Average frequency of lodging for the 96 men isequal to about one, night per week) .h. The Railway Executive have not sought to introducefresh lodging turns without adequate notice being given through the men&apos;s accredited representatives,nor without proper lodging accommodation being available.     Expenses allowed for lodging haverecently been increased.In expressing regret for the inconvenience caused to the public by the irregular obstruction, by a section ofthe staff, of the reasonable application of a necessary and agreed principle, the Railway Executive&apos;point out thatto. abandon this principle would be to subordinate the.efficiency and economy of the public service to the personalfeelings of those railwayrnen whose duty it should be to operate that service in the public interest.(&quot;What the Dispute is About&quot;;       A factual memorandum explaining the operation of the &quot;lodging turn&quot; system,and of the staff arrangements and allowances inconnection therewith, is attached for information).-2-

IllANNEX  &apos;bf&quot;LODGING TURNS&quot;:    WHAT THE DISPUTE IS about what constitutes a &quot;Lodging .Turn&quot; ;&apos;   Agreementwith Trade Unions; i Frequency of Lodging Turns.Lodging Allowance;, r HostelsWhat is a &quot;lodging turn1&apos;?All workings of locomotives and their crews are based on motive power depots.   As far as possible, the workingof engine crews is so designed that the men start their turnof duty at their home depot and return there by the expiry oftheir recognised turn of duty - between 8 and 9 hours.    Thisis achieved,  either by working an outward trip to a point fromwhich they can return with the same or another locomotive tothe starting point by the time required, or by working a longeroutward trip and then returning to their home depot aspassengers.There are many, instances where the outward tripshave to be kept uneconomically short if the men are to workanother train home within the time required, while to bring menhome as passengers when they are being paid for working iswasteful of both money and man-power.   Moreover,  the stoppingof long-distance trains intermediately for the sole purpose of changing enginemen slows down traffic, wastes line capacity,and, by reason of the ample margins which have to be allowed in order to ensure that a train shall not be held up waiting fora relief crew, is again -wasteful of man-power.    In the case of long-distance passenger trains which may bo already fullyloaded with through passengers, the convenience and comfort ofthe public may be affected by the unnecessary congestion caused in trains that would not otherwise stop.For these reasons, the practice of working loco-motives over as long distances as practicable by a single crew,who lodge at the end (or at a convenient stage of) the journey,and return home next day, is an important factor in sound railwayworking;    the same principle also applies to the postering ofguards.Arrangement covered by long-standing agreement the long-established principle of &quot;lodging turns&quot;was confirmed by the National Agreement (1919) with the TradeUnions, and prior to the outbreak of war in 1939 the system wasin widespread use.   As a temporary expedient during the war,however, ,the former railway companies greatly reduced thenumber of lodging turns, according to the circumstances of eachroute,  in order to spare men the anxiety of being away from home during enemy air raids, and owing to war-time difficultiesin feeding&quot;and private lodging arrangements.With the return of more normal conditions, and withthe extensive provision of railway hostels,  the railwaycompanies and latterly the Railway Executive have sought to restore lodging turns where necessary in order to assist therestoration of more efficient and economical working, the latteraspect being particularly important in view of the higher costs of labour and materials, and the shorter working week, introduced in 1947.

In May, 19U.8, ttio Railway Executive met the TradeUnions concerned (the National Union of Railwaymen and the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen) and undertook a now lino of approach.   This had two main features:(a) willingness to consider reduction of lodging turns on slow-moving trains,  and (b) the definite statement that lodging turnson high-speed long-distance non-stop trains, both passenger and freight, were an essential feature of railway working, andthat if the Railway. Executive were to provide the facilitiesnecessary to the travelling and trading public,  certain freshlodging turns would be needed on those types of train.The Railway Executive have been prepared to discuss with the Unions the operation of the arrangement of the lodging-turns before putting them into operation.The fear of redundancyIt is felt that much of the opposition to lodgingturns arises,from the fear that any large extension of suchturns will create redundancy.   The Railway Executive state,however,  that the working of lodging turns does not in itself of necessity lead to redundancy.Frequency of lodging turnsAn essential principle in framing lodging turns isthat the men should be away from home as short a time aspracticable consistent with proper rest at the &quot;away&quot; terminal.In a typical case (one of the turns which the G-ateshoad men have refused to work) the crew would have been 7 hours 27 minutes,on duty on the outward journey;- 13 hours Ud minutes resting inLondon;    and 7 hours 20 minutes on duty on the return trip -a total time of 28 hours 32 minutes away from home.For the purpose of engine working, .the crews arearranged in.&quot;links&quot;, the duties of the men in each &quot;link&quot;changing weekly in rotation, and, by agreement with the men,the lodging turns are confined to specified &quot;links&quot;.    Thus, atthe two depots (He a ton and Gfateshead) primarily involved in thepresent dispute, only 26 men out of an aggregate of 92h wouldhave been required to work, lodging turns.   The average frequency of lodging wotild have been 8 nights away from home in 6 weeks in the case of the Hoaton men, and 7 times in 7 weeks in thecase of the Gateshead men.Enginemen&apos;s payEnginemen working long distances receive additionalpayment beyond &quot;their normal pay.   They are paid on &quot;mileage&apos;1&apos;rates,  the first IhO miles being considered equal to 8 hours,and subsequent mileage- at the rate of 15 miles equalling one-hour&apos;s pay.Lodging allowanpeIn addition to pay,  each man receives a speciallodging allowance to cover cost of-hostel accommodation andmeals;&quot; this allowance is based-on length of time away from home.   Within the past three weeks the Railway Executive havenegotiated an amendment to&quot;the national Agreement,  grantingincreased lodging allowances, the N.U.R. and A.S.L.E.E. beingparties to this amendment.    In the case of the Heaton andGateshead lodging turns now under- discussion,  the allowance would be 9s. per man for each round trip.The normal charge in railway hostels is Is. per bedand Is. for each main meal.

Hostel. AccommoclationNormally men booked on lodging turns are acoomr.10-.dated at official railway hostels,  equipped with modernconveniences and suitable amenities for relaxation andrefreshmentse   Where.suitable hostels are not available and private accommodation has to be used for new turns, thedifference in cost is paid by the Railway Executive.It was proposed that the Heaton and dateshead men would lodge at the official British Railways Hostel atKentish Town, N.\7.

ENGINEMEN &apos; S LODGING TURNS DISPUTEThe following announcement was made by theRailway Executive tonight  (Tuesday)At the meeting today (Tuesday) with the National&apos;Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and. Firemen, the Railway Executive put forward proposals for joint action with the two Unions, which theExecutive hoped might lead towards the immediate cessation of unofficial withdrawals of labour by motive power staffon Sundays in the Eastern and North Eastern Regions ofBritish Railways..The &quot;proposals made &quot;by the Railway Executive were(1)    Exhibition to staffs at motive power depots coneerneof a notice setting out the conditions underwhich lodging away from home will apply on theEast Coast route.      This notice would have been signed jointly on behalf of the Railway executive and the Trade Unions.(2)    Formation, of a small committee of Union and Executivrepresentatives to examine all rosters whichiinvolve additional lodging.      (East Coast turnsof duty to be examined first).(3),   Representatives of the two Unions and of theExecutive to address meetings of local representatives of the staff concerned in thearea involved.The meeting held to-day (Tuesday) Between theExecutive and the Unions was adjourned to enable the union representatives to consider these proposals.      Subsequently,however,  intimation was received from the N.U.R.  that they&quot;regretted their inability to take any further action atthis juncture.&quot;In these circumstances,, the- Railway Executive, have proceeded on their own initiative with the followingannouncement to the staff concerned in order to remove any possible misapprehension of a largo scale extension of thelodging -principle.      This announcement to the staff will bedisplayed tomorrow  (Wednesday) at all motive -power depots inthe affeet0d area;-&quot;The Railway Executive desire to advise allenginemen. and guards concerned that&apos; the -principleof lodging needs to be operated under the conditions set out below.      In coming to this decision theyare not intending to disturb any existing lodgingarrangements but in re-introducing lodging on theEast Coaotroute they will be governed by thefollowing conditions only,, which will NOT beextended.

1.      Long distance travel, &quot;by passenger train,giving a through.:.non-stop service,thereby earning the appreciation of the travelling public, and creating prestigefor the industry.2.      Long distance movement of important freight traffic,  convoyed by fitted or partiallyfitted freight trains, ensuring a fastover-night service, with a one claydelivery.3.     To cover special workings,  such as excursions,-   where owing to the short lay-over time,particularly on Sundays, it is not &quot;possibleto provide adequate relief&quot;.N.U.R. WAGES CLAIk. DEVELOPMENTSAs regards the N.U.R. claim for 10s. a weelcincrease in wages and salaries,  the Railway Executiveyesterday (Monday)  offered to resume negotiations with theN.U.R. and the other railway trade unions who are signatories to the various agreements affecting rates of pay and condition:of service.      The Executive gave to the Unions a broadindication of the extent to which they are prepared to discussboth minimum rates and other outstanding matters.     This offer of a meeting has now been accepted by the N.U.R.  and it ishoped, to arrange it this week.
