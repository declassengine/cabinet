THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1949SECRETCP. (49) 144&amp;h July, 1949Copy No.31CABINETMEAT: SOURCES OF SUPPLY OTHER THAN ARGENTINAMemorandum by the Minister of food on 10th March (CM. (49) 19th Conclusions, Minute 5 (3)), the Cabinet asked me to prepare a paper setting out what steps could be taken to make the UnitedKingdom less dependent upon Argentine meat supplies. I give below a survey of the whole field of possible sources of meat supply throughout the world.Introduction2. Before the war the United Kingdom consumed something over 2 million tons of meat a year. Of this, total, about half came from home production^ ,and-half from overseas. About 90 per cent, of our imports were drawn from theArgentine, Australia and New Zealand: of these countries the Argentine was by far the largest supplier.We are now getting only about 75 per cent, of our pre-war supplies. The maindecrease has been in home production, which has fallen from a pre-war averageof over 1 million tons to 720,000 tons in 1948. Imports have fallen from over1 million tons to 875,000 tons in 1948. The following table illustrates theposition:-Sources of the United Kingdom&apos;s Supplies of Carcase Meat and OffalSupplying country:Australia  ...New Zealand       ...CanadaArgentineUruguayBrazilChileDenmarkUnited StatesMiscellaneous%:&apos;-/v&quot;-&apos;.-&quot;.&apos;       &quot;&apos;   -Total imported   ...      ...United Kingdom home productionTotal supplies......   .  ..:3.   With the increase in population, the impact of full employment, and themore equitable distribution of wealth, the potential effective demand for meatjat present prices is estimated at. up to 2,500,000 tons a year.  Thus the suppliesof approximately 1,600,000 tons which we received in 1948 represent only.about two-thirds of the total meat supplies which we would like to have.37233war average	1947	1948Thousand tons (bone-		-in)202	178	150263	358	3676	...18	20438	445	31042	12	1631	2	111	6	62	30	312	55	...&apos;12	2	21,019	1,106	8751,096	719	7202,115	1,825	1,595b
4. Well before the. end of the war it was clear that, owing to the ploughing up of grass and the reductioh/of flocks and herds in the war areas, there wouldbe an acute&apos; shortage of meat. So far as our principal overseas suppliers were^concerned (Australia, New Zealand and Argentina), it was realised that the basisI for increasing production would have to be found in assurances that they could expect a continuing and unlimited market in the United Kingdom for many years at fair prices. In order to give the necessary assurances, the system of long-term contracts was started with Australia and New Zealand as long ago.as .1944. InOctober of that year we signed four-year contracts with those countries? We tiavesince signed a seven-year contract with New Zealand and extended the Australiancontract for two years pending signature of a new long-term contract (we havefifteen years in mind).Contracts were agreed for shorter periods with Argentina and Uruguay andthe periods would have been extended if relations with those countries had developed differently.Home Production . : &apos;,&apos;5. Home-killed supplies continue to be some 300,000 tons a year below thepre-war average. The reasons for this are well known. Apart from the ploughing up during the war of much of the grassland to grow more grain, they includethe heavy losses of livestock during the severe winter of 1946-47, the prioritygiven to increased milk production, and the continuing shortage of imported feeding-stuffs. But we have touched bottom: and from now on we can hope fora steady improvement under the Government&apos;s programme of agricultural expan-sion and ^guaranteed prices, calf-rearing schemes and the/&quot;like, especially withthe more intensive development of our grasslands and with the natural.liking ofthe British farmer for livestock production. The June 1948 census showed some very promising signs of recovery: Thus 200,000; more calves were reared.thanin the previous twelve months, there was&apos; a1 recovery in breeding ewes, the lambcrop was exceptionally good, and breeding sows and gilts increased, from 162,000:at June 1947 to 270,000 in June 1948..6. The following table,gives, particulars of home production (excluding fatstock from Southern Ireland) before the war, in 1947 and 1948, and the targets for 1952-53^ ,United Kingdom Meat ProductionExpansionProgrammePre-war TargetsAverage    1947       1948     1952-53Thousans tons carcase weigh-Up)Beef and Veal......      ...      578        497        493        636Mutton and Lamb        ... 195 117 124 162Figmeat (excluding bacon and self supplies)   ...      ...      ...      173 14 20Total   ...      ...      ...      946 628 637 853:Note.(a): excluding offal. &apos;J&apos;-7. If we could expand the pig population by increasing the feeding-stuffsration, it would be the quickest way of increasing home meat supplies. The totalanimal feeding-stuffs in the form, of &quot;concentrates&quot; which are. available in1948-^49 amount to some 8 million tons, which is on the way to a restoration ofthe pre-war supply of between 11 and 12 million tons. The level in 1949-50will of course depend upon the supplies obtained from the US.SR. and Argentina.The Irish Republic   - ,      ,8. Our principal imports from the Irish; Republic are; stores, and .the recently improved prices to British farmers will be reflected in the prices whichthey will be able to-pay for these stores. An increase in the numbers&apos; shipped&apos; tothe United Kingdom to be fattened is highly desirable. Last year we receivedonly 282,661 head against an average of 492,928 in 1934-38.  But we have taken
special steps -to secure an improvement. I agreed with the Eire ^Governmentlast year to pay the same price,- both for their cattle sent here as fat cattle andfor: their store cattle fattened here, as we pay for United Kingdom bred cattle(after allowing for the pre-war subsidy). In return the Eire authorities agreedto limit their exports to continental Europe to 10 per cent; of their total exports.During the first quarter of 1949 imports of fats and stores from Eire were 99,812head as compared with 86,146 in the first quarter of 1948.Supplies from Continental Europe9. \ Most continental European countries, in particular Belgium, Holland,Italyj Spain, Portugal^ Switzerland and Western Germany, are net importersof meat. In 1948 they took from South America upwards of 170,000 tons which otherwise would have come to us. Even France bought in South America lastyear. Whenever we discuss trade with a European country we ask whether anymeat is likely to be available; not only do the quantities generally turn out to be negligible, but the country in question has seldom the necessary facilities forprocessing and transporting any meat that might be available.The quantity of mutton and beef available from Europe is never likely to be substantial, except perhaps in the case of France (see below). Pigmeat is more promising.- -Frayice t        -10. - As regards France, we have reached agreement upon measures whichwill permit the import of meat while ,at the same time safeguarding the health of bur own herds. Unfortunately no more is likely to be available for the nextfew months than about 2,500 tons of frozen pork now, with some thousands oftons later in the year. We are arranging for trial consignments to be seht overand these will be used for making sausages, &amp;c. We shall do everything we canto encourage further imports, not only of pigmeat, but of beef also, but -the quantities will not be considerable for some time. The French authorities havesuggested that they may be able to export annually perhaps 20,000 tons from ayear hence;, rising up to 120,000 tons in four years, but experience has taught usto be rather wary of. such estimates. - 1Denmark . 111. Denmark undertook to send- us 11,000 tons of beef during 1948. Sofar she has been able to supply only 3,000 tons, and future prospects are nothopeful. , &apos;.&apos; (   &apos;\^;&apos;^;-;-;;;i&apos;;^;^:1 -/     &apos;Iceland . &apos; -Ad &apos; &apos;12.: During the war we received small quantities of mutton from this source(1,900 tons in 1943 and 1,700 tons in 1944), but the quality was poor and theprice exorbitant. No substantial quantities can be looked for in the future, butwe shall take any that is available at satisfactory prices.Yugoslavia ,13. For some time the Yugoslavs have been saying that they would liketo. develop meat production for the United Kingdom and they aim to export30,000&apos; tons a year of beef, veal, mutton and lamb in four or five years&apos; time.But this year meat is so short in Yugoslavia that we can count upon very little of the 1,500 tons of carcase meat provided for in the 1948-49 agreement, nor can we expect much in 1950. The Yugoslavs are also planning to send us up to10,000 tons of pigmeat as bacon by 1952-53. No additional supplies of pigmeatcan be secured unless we are prepared to substitute pork for other carcase meat.Roumama14. As the result of persistent enquiries en our part, the Roumanians havenow indicated that from 10,000 to 15,000 tons of meat, some of which would becanned, might be available for early delivery to the United Kingdom. But thequestion whether these supplies can be secured is likely to turn upon our ability to concede the rights for which the Roumanians are asking in relation to exports from the United Kingdom. At the moment it seems probable that serious dimcul-ties will arise. The matter is now being discussed and possibilities will be followedlip with vigour, but at this stage we cannot he optimistic.37233 b 2
Turkey15. Suggestions that small quantities of meat may be available from Turkeyare being investigated and one of our meat experts may go out to Turkey shortly to look into the possibilities.Western Hemisphere16. Throughout the Americas there is a steady increase in local consumptionof meat with no corresponding increase in production. The surplus availablefor export is therefore steadily shrinking, and it seems probable that in futurereally substantial quantities can come only from Argentina.17. Canada. During some of the war years Canada supplied us with usefulquantities of meat and in 1945 sent us as much as 100,000 tons. Owing to the dollar difficulty we stopped buying and the Canadian surplus has been going overthe border into the United States, where production has not been equal to localneeds. Furchases cannot be resumed in Canada unless the dollar difficulty isovercome, and then only on the basis of a fairly long-term arrangement, since the canadians could scarcely be expected to close the border into the United Statesagain for a short period.18. United States of America. During the war years we also obtained con-siderable quantities of meat from the United States an average of 115,000. tonsof carcase meat and 91,000 tons of canned meat from 1940 to 1945. .But home production has not been sufficient for domestic needs since rationing was aban-abandoned. In 1948 the United States bought no less than 190,000 tons carcase weightequivalent in competition with us in South America, all in the form of canned meat.&apos; Moreover, dollar difficulties apart, the supply prospects make it unlikelythat we shall be able to buy any beef or mutton there for some time. But therewill probably be a surplus of pigmeat in the United States in the fairly nearfuture, probably in the autumn, and some supplies even earlier. Out of the$50 million which, at their meeting on 24th March (E.P.C. (49) 9th Meeting,Minute 5, Conclusion 2), the Economic Policy Committee agreed should be spenton food for current consumption, we have bought some 4,500 tons of pork and^0,000 tons of canned beef stew of Mexican origin at a cost of about $10 million.19. Mexico. When we learned in March 1947 that the United States hadprohibited the importation of Mexican cattle for veterinary reasons we imme-diately sent an expert to find out what was the prospect of our purchasingsupplies of meat there. He reported favourably, but unfortunately we were pre-vented from completing a contract by the dollar crisis which arose a little later in that year. Two of my officers paid a second visit to Mexico a few months agowith the Simon Mission in an endeavour to buy the meat under a bilateral agree-ment involving no expenditure of dollars. But the Mexican Government havebeen dilatory. However, they have now agreed to send over a purchasing mission to ascertain what they could obtain in exchange for meat, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer has personally invited the Mexican Finance Minister to come toLondon himself. Given favourable conditions, it is believed that quantities ofthe order of 10 or 20,000 tons could be bought from Mexico in the first year andthat this might be built up to 100,000 tons in the course of a few years. Mean-while, as mentioned above, we have bought 20,000 tons of Mexican canned beefstew from the United States Department of Agriculture for distribution on points.20. Guatemala. At one time prospects from Guatemala seemed promisingand we signed a contract with a local company under which we agreed to take anymeat made available for shipment. But the &quot;price we have been paying is rela-tively high and quantities disappointingly small. Moreover, the Guatemalanshave now put an embargo upon all meat exports and no supplies are being received at present.21. Nicaragua. Suggestions have been made that meat is available inNicaragua. But our enquiries have shown that there are no suitable processing,arrangements and that in any event the surplus of cattle is consumed locally.22. Brazil. Before the war Brazil used to send us from 30,000 to 40,000tons a year, and in one of the war years sent as much as 80,000 tons of carcase meat together with fair supplies of canned meats.   There has, however, been a
virtual prohibition of export, except of small quantities of canned meats andfrozen offals, for several years, as Brazilians cannot now produce enough to satisfytheir increased local demands. We have a meat expert stationed in Brazil whois in the closest touch both with Brazilian officials and with the representativesof the exporters, and we are satisfied that if the situation should alter he will notlose any opportunity of getting supplies. There is now some hope that a smallsurplus of carcase meat, perhaps 10,000 tons, may become available this year.23 1 Uruguay. Uruguay used to send us about 40,000 tons of carcase meat and some canned meat before the war, and maintained fair supplies during thewar. Latterly our arrangements with Uruguay have not been very satisfactory as she has tried to move in parallel with Argentina, though never ceasing toprofess her friendship for us. Like Argentina, she has seized opportunities of selling meat to continental buyers at higher prices than those at which she hadcontracted with us, and like Argentina she defaulted on quantities which.sheundertook to sell to us. She contracted to sell us 34,000 tons in the year to mid-February 1949, and has only delivered 17,000 tons; she has since let us havethe rest, but as she might now have been delivering further quantities against anew contract her default means an actual loss of meat to us. The country has suffered from drought, but this does not justify failure to fulfil our contract. In1948 Uruguay shipped no less than 62,000 tons (carcase weight eqivalent) to otherdestinations. Discussions have begun in Montevideo in preparation for the negotiation of a contract for further supplies which may amount to-40,000 tonsin a year. -24. Paraguay. Paraguay does not ship carcase meat, but only cannedmeats, and we purchase from her all that she will sell to us. In 1948 we receivednearly 4,300 tons, or just over half her exports.25. Chile.-The only supplies available from Chile come from Patagonia,where before and during the war we used to get about 10,000 tons of carcase meat.The quantity available for export has fallen to about 6,000 tons, mainly owingto increased local consumption, but under our contract with the shippers wepurchase the whole of the exportable surplus.26.&apos; Falkland Islands. The highest exportable surplus from the falkland islands so far has been about 800 tons per annum, a quantity which has apparentlynot attracted sufficient interest to induce private enterprise to set up a freezingplant. I understand, however, that the Colonial Development Corporation nowhas a project for doing so. Meanwhile we have done all we can to encourage the shipment of sheep on the hoof to the freezing works on the mainland.27. Elsewhere in South America, and particularly in Colombia, Ecuadorand Venezuela, we hear from time to time stories about immense possibilities this is particularly true of Colombia but no definite proposals have ever beenmade for developing these sources, apart from the establishment some years agoin Venezuela of a packing plant which has fallen into disuse because of lack ofsupplies.  Venezuela in fact now imports limited quantities of meat.Southern Commonwealth Countries28. New Zealand. The export of meat to us from New Zealand hasincreased substantially since before the war, from about 260,000 tons to360,000 tons, and under our recent long-term contract, which covers a period of seven years, New Zealand has agreed to take such measures as are necessary toincrease the rate of export to us at the end of the seven years by another50,000 tons. In view of progress so far, we do not feel quite sure that we shall receive the extra quantity, but there is every evidence that all possible efforts willbe made.29. Australia. There is little prospect of additional supplies of meat from australia during the next year or two, &quot;but in the long run she provides animportant source for substantial additional imports. We have been urging uponthe Australians for several years the need to increase their production, and duringthe past year the Australian Government have put in hand the preparation of plans for big developments. The Australian Prime Minister reported on theprogress of these preparations during his visit in the spring, and it was clearthat only very slow progress had been made. His Government had approved some minor proposals costing about  1 -5 milion, which should result in the production
of an extra 10,000 tons of meat annually eight years hence around Wyndham, inthe northern part of Western Australia, but comparatively little progress hadbeen made with the preparation of their plans for Other areas. Moreover, there appeared to be something of a tendency to reduce the scale of the developmentsproposed, and the Australian estimate of the extra production which would resultten years hence from all their plans for new areas was little more than 50,000 tons.In addition, however (and both the Australians and I attach great importance tothis), at least as much extra exports might obtained from increased productionin the settled parts of Australia. On the other hand, Australians home demands for meat are almost certain to increase steadily with her increasing population,30. During his visit Mr. Chifiey emphasised the need for negotiation ofan agreement guaranteeing a market for Australia^ meat in the United kingdom for a really long term (say, 15 years) in order to establish the conditions underwhich producers, as well as&apos; the Commonwealth and State Governments, could give greater impetus to plans for increasing production. With the agreementof the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I therefore informed Mr, Chifley that wewere prepared to enter into negotiations for such an agreement, in return foran undertaking by the Australian Government to promote development schemes which offer good prospects of increased supplies of a magnitude to be agreed with us. I have in mind that we should press for the adoption of plans toincrease exports by 50,000 tons annually after five years and by an additional50,000 tons annually after ten years. Mr. Chifley has arranged for the investi-gations in Australia to be expedited, and I hope that the Australian plans willbe available in sufficient detail to provide the basis for the negotiation of theproposed agreement in about three months&apos; time.Africa31. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has now set up a working party on supplies of meat from the Colonies^- among which the African Colonies seemto offer the greatest promise. My Department is represented and we shallco-operate in the inquiry to the full. Over much of Africa production is atpresent greatly restricted by endemic diseases, and although during the past few years I have made many enquiries, I have so far found very little promise of supplies. If meat could be produced for export in quantity in AfricaI have little doubt that we could deal satisfactorily with the restrictionson imports which are at present imposed for disease control purposes. But thestandard of living in many parts of Africa is now improving as the result ofdevelopment schemes of many kinds. In consequence the demand for meat is increasing and in the West African Colonies is already becoming a drain onour canned meat supplies from Australia and New Zealand. Any moderateincrease in Africa&apos;s production might therefore largely be consumed locally, andit might be a considerable time before we benefited.32. Sudan. After consultation with officers from the Sudan GovernmentI sent an expert there but, as in the rest of Colonial Africa, there seems littlepossibility of export except for small quantities in canned form until the diseasedifficulties have been overcome.33. Abyssinia. There have been frequent references to vast possibilities in Abyssinia, but the control of disease appears to be a more difficult problemthere than almost anywhere else.34. Union of South Africa. As regards South Africa we are repeatedlyassured that there is no exportable surplus. Indeed, the Union imports small quantities of canned meats both from Australia and South America.35. Madagascar. France is the normal market for meat exported fromMadagascar. During the war, when the island was cut off from France, we obtained small consignments from this source, but they amounted to less than2,000 tons in all. The exportable surplus varies very considerably, but even in agood year is estimated to be no more than 6,000 to 9,000 tons of carcase meat and perhaps 7,000 tons of canned meats. Exports of meat are now rigidly controlled and the bulk of them are again going to France. Prices are high and the meatgenerally of poor quality. There are prospects that small quantities may continueto find their way from Madagascar to our Colonies in the vicinity, e.g., Mauritius,
on a trader-to-trader basis, thus reducing to some extent Colonial demand onAustralian supplies, for which we have to provide. We cannot hope for morethan this.Asia &apos;/-&apos;.-./.&apos; ; ;::36. There are no facilities anywhere in Asia for processing meat for exportso far as we have been able to ascertain; nor are there any likely possibilities ofexportable surpluses except, perhaps,&quot; a faint chance in India and Pakistan.We are at present investigating suggestions that have been made about theproduction of beef in Pakistan and of pigmeat in India.Conclusions37. I should be misleading my colleagues if I left them with the impression that there is very much chance of finding alternative sources of supply within,say, five years from now for much of the meat which has come to us fromArgentina. The proposed Australian developments, although of great potentialimportance, are expected to provide only 100,000 tons ten years hence. Even ifArgentina sends us under the new Agreement an annual quantity of 400,000 tons,and if home production achieves its target, we shall still need in 1952 over300,000 tons more than is at present in sight. There is nowhere in the worldterritory which offers anything like the same prospect of increased supplies asdoes Argentina. Moreover, costs of production in Argentina are low. A great part of that country is situated in a latitude which is friendly to the continuousgrowth of the most luscious pasture. Linseed Cake and coarse grains are availablein the country in large quantities to supplement the grass. Cattle can graze allthe year round without shelter. The ports are equipped to freeze, handle, and ship enormous quantities of meat. Vast areas are still only partly used. Inthis paper I have made scarcely any reference to costs and prices, and in the short term they can almost be ignored. But in the longer run they are of primarysignificance. For costs and prices determine the volume of our goods which haveto go to pay for meat supplies. The more cheaply we can-buy our meat, the morewill be available in goods (and the resources which produce them) for the satis-faction of other needs. Recently we have been taking only 20 per cent, of thetotal Argentine production of meat. An increase by 20 per cent, in that production could give us all we need.Our best hope of sufficient meat lies in that development of our trade with argentina for which the new Agreement provides. The expansion during the nextfew years of our exports to the Argentine, of engineering and other scarceproducts which she can no longer afford to- buy in the United States could produce more meat for us more quickly than developments, however attractive, incompletely new areas.J.
