DOGukSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BlhTTAMTIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSS E C R E TiVVii fiAY.CABIN7ETIMPORT LICENSING REGTRICTIOHGmemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Intra-European Payments Scheme will come underreview at the forthcoming meeting of the Ministerial Consulta--tive Group of the 0. E. E. C.      The United States authorities havebeen pressing strongly the suggestion that drawing rights underthe scheme should be made transferable or convertible in orderto make progress towards the liberalisation of European trade which is one of the main objectives of Marshall Aid.      This isunacceptable to us since it would involve us in risk of loss of dollars to ether countries.      But if we are to resist American-pressure suecassfully Wo must ourselves make constructive proposals for liberalising trade and to stimulate economic and competitive production in Europe.2. .-. fundamental condition for any relaxations of UnitedKingdom controls on imports from Europe is that they should beextended within a short  time if not at once bo the sterling commonwealth countries.      This involves our being able to count on the early supersession of the non-discrimination undor-takings in Section 9 of the Anglo-American Loan Agre.C5rn.ont by themore flexible provisions of the Havana Charter&quot;:    without this we could extend the relaxation only to &quot;war-shattered&quot;countries within Europe and to the Colonies.      A similarsituation exists with Canada.3, Until recently it was thought that proceedings in theUnited Goatee Congress which would have given us this assurancewould have taken place within a few weeks.      but it now appearsthat any decision by Congress may well be delayed until the;autumn or the beginning of next year and with it the prospectof any early release from our Section 9 obligations.L&apos;r, In order to seek a way out of this dilemma theEconomic; Policy Committee on 26th May (E. P. 0. (b-9) &quot;19th Mooting,Minute 2.) authorised an approach to the United States Govern-ment with a view to finding out what they are prepared to doand What constructive suggestions they are prepared to make,explaining that we are ready and anxious to take the initiative in relaxing import controls but that we can only do so if v/eare free to extend them to the whole of the sterling area andthat this depends on being released from cur obligations underSection 9 of the Loan Agreement.      An approach to the canadian government about our non-discrimination obligations to thenwas also authorised.      These approaches are now being made.&apos; &apos;j. An official \- orking Party has recently reported onthe relaxations in our import licensing restrictions whichcould reasonably and equitably be made without involvingmaterial inereason in dollar or geld expenditure or losses indollar earnings.      The relaxations recommended would generally:take the form of Open General Licences for imports of specifiedgoods from specified countries.      These would include germany which, as the principal engineering country, v/ill give rise tospocial problems of its own,  especially in relation to the copy PO.   0
engineering; industry.      The relaxations would apply to a range of goods of all classes covering a large part of our trade on private account from soft currency countries.6. has repeatedly been explained to manufacturers andproducers,  quantitative control of imports, though it has anadventitious protective effect, can be justified only ifnecessary to safeguard our balance of payments:    thus, when we.justify the removal of these import controls, as we shall haveto do, as no longer required on balance of payments grounds, woshall have to have an answer to those who enquire whether theymay present a case for increased tariff protection.      Theobject of this proposal is to get a general liberalisation oftrade.      If there are any c uses of particular hardship v/e mustbe prepared to consider what measures should be taken to meet their special difficulties, e. g.  by the adjustment of tariffs.7. Apart from the pressure we ore under from the UnitedStates Government to liberalise trade within Europe, there arcthe following further very powerful reasons in the interests ofour own economy for going as far as we can in this direction:--(a) /i reduction of licensing controls, by increasingcompetition, will reduce costs and improve thequality of our own products and so stimulate our competitive power in world markets.(b) The net effect of freer competition within Europe andthe sterling area should be to reduce prices to theconsumer.(c) The burden of administrative work on the CivilService and on industry will be reduced.(d) The rigidities and distortions which are the result of present bilateralism in international trade will bereduced.fi* V7e should propose to take the load in introducingimport relaxations without bargaining for similar relaxationsin our favour, though v/e should make it clear that we could not continue them on the initial scale unless other countries agreudto act similarly except in so far as their balance of payments position prevented it.      Our import controls will not be dis-mantled and the adjustment or re-imposition of controls on particular goods or in respect of particular countries will beable to be made if circumstances warrant.9. For all these reasons there is a strong case forrelaxing import controls over as wide a front in terms of commodities as wo can reasonably justify on grounds of domestic policy, and there is therefore much to be said for proceeding at once on the sort of scale (subject to adjustment on particular items) recommended in the official Working ?arty&apos;s report.      ido not, moreover, think that anything substantially loss thanrelaxations on this scale would enable us to answer Americancriticisms on our European trade and payments policy, and indeed it is by no moans certain that these will suffice.
