CABINETIRELAND bill memorandum by the Lord Chancellory the Home secretary and .the- Secretary of St.ate foF Commonwealth RelationsOur colieagj.es should be aware of the action we propose to take to meet a point raised by Viscount Simon inproceedings on&apos;the Ireland Bill in the House of Lords on26th May,    The proceedings were adjourned in order that LordSimon&apos;s point might be considered, and will be resumed on 30th May.2. The effect of the British Nationality Act, 1948, isthat a person who on 31st December, 1948,  was both a british subject and a citizen of Eire ceased to be a British subject on 1st January, 1949, unless his father was born in the UnitedKingdom.    Such o person- however, may, if a &quot;citizen of Eire&quot;,claim under section 2(1)  to remain a British subject, on theground of his associations with the United Kingdom or theColonies *3* We have always held that a person born in southern ireland before 6th December, 1922, was not a citizen of Eireon 31st December&apos;, 1948, unless -(a) he was domiciled &quot;in Southern Ireland on 6th December, 1922;    or(b) he was permanently resident in Southern Ireland on or after 10th April, 1935;    or(c) he registered as a citizen of Eire.Accordingly, we have considered that a person born in southern ireland before 6th December, 1922, who was at that datedomiciled in Northern Ireland and had thereafter permanentlyresided in Northern Ireland and was not registered as a citizen of Eire, was not a citizen of Eire on 31st December, 1948, andtherefore, under section 12(4) of the British Nationality Act,automatically he came a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies on 1st january&apos;, 1949, with the result that he hid no need to make a claim under section 2(1) as a &quot;citizen of Eire&quot;in order to remain, a British subject.4. In the House of Lords on Thursday Lopd Simon argued,on the strength of an opinion obtained from a member of the staffof the High Commissioner for the Irish Republic, - that though aperson born in Southern Ireland who had acquired an English orScottish domicile before 6th December, 1922, was not a citizen of Eire, a person whose domicile had been in Northern ireland on 6th December, 1922, was regarded by the Government of theIrish Republic as a citizen of Eire and could not,  therefore,have become a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies on1st January, 1949.    The Government of the Irish- Republic havebeen asked whether they agree with this view and they havereplied that they do.5. V/e consider it essential to put beyond question curview that a person born in Southern Ireland before 6th December,1922, but domiciled in Northern Ireland on that date,  is just asCOPY NO.

much a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies as a similarperson who was domiciled in England or Scotland.      we accordingly propose, after consultation with the Attorney-General, that the Lord Chancellor should.move the followingnew Clause in the resumed Committee proceedings on the1 Ireland Bill:-&quot;So much of subsection (h) of section twelve ofthe British Nationality Act..  194o, as prevented a personbecoming a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies ifhe was at the date of the commencement of that Act a citizen of Eire, and so much of subsection (1) of sectionthirteen of that Act as prevented a person remaining aBritish subject without citizenship, if he was at that dated citizen of Eire, shall not be deemed to have applied toany person born before the sixth day of December nineteenhundred, and twenty-two unless either -(a) he was, on the said.sixth day of December,domiciled in the part of Ireland which nowforms the Republic of Ireland;    or(b) he was, on or after the tenth day of Aprilnineteen hundred and thirty-five, and beforethe date of the commencement of that Act,permanently resident in that part of Ireland;or(c) he had, before the date of the commencement ofthat Act, been registered as a citizen of eire under the laws of that part of Irelandrelating to citizenship.&quot;6. V/e also propose to send a message to the Governmentof the Irish Republic before the Committee proceedings begininforming them that this new Clause is to be moved.J..P. J.
