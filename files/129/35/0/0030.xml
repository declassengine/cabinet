THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS government cc Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1949SECRETCP. (49) 14022nd June, 1949CABINETANGLO-NORWEGIAN FISHERY dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe ProblemHis Majesty&apos;s Government have made repeated efforts to obtain settlement by agreement of the dispute about Norwegian fishery limits. Norway, on theother hand, has shown reluctance to come to any agreement or to accept a modus vivendi pending such agreement. Norwegian fishery cruisers have arrestedBritish vessels fishing in areas regarded as being part of the high seas. Thereis some danger that British skippers may take retaliatory action if a speedysettlement cannot be achieved.Recommendation2. I therefore recommend that, unless a decision to accept the modus vivendiis forthcoming from the Norwegian Government by the end of July, the case should be referred for decision to the International Court of Justice at TheHague, preferably by agreement with the Norwegian Government, but if necessaryunilaterally. In CP. (49) 9 of 13th January last I informed my colleagues of theadvice given by the Law Officers on this matter.Considerations3. In CP. (48) 257, dated 8th November, 1948, I dealt with the dispute between the Norwegian Government and His .Majesty&apos;s Government aboutNorwegian exclusive fishing limits. Following a discussion in Cabinet on15th November, 1948 (CM. (48) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 4), I was invited to (1) obtain from the Law Officers a formal Opinion on the strength of theBritish case in the dispute;(2) explore the prospects of securing a satisfactory settlement of the disputeby negotiation, while meanwhile maintaining the status quo;(3) take all necessary preliminary steps for a reference of the matter tothe International Court, so that there would be no avoidable delay. in presenting the case if negotiations broke down and if the cabinet decided, in the light of the Law Officers&apos; Opinion, that the case shouldbe submitted to the Court.4. In accordance with the decision at (2) above, discussions between British -and Norwegian officials took place in January, 1949, at which proposals were.drawn up for submission to both Governments. These defined a new line, knownas the &quot; Yellow Line,&quot; as the limit of exclusive Norwegian fishing rights. Itwas suggested that this line might form the basis of a lasting agreement betweenthe two Governments. It was further suggested that, until the matter was finally settled either by agreement or by a decision of the International Court,the &quot; Yellow Line &quot; should be adopted by both parties, without prejudice to theirlegal rights, as a temporary modus vivendi, to remain in force until a final settlement was reached. - By this means it was hoped to avoid furtherincidents on the fishing grounds during the interim period while a settlement was being reached.37184Copy No. 3
5. I reported the position in CP. (49) 9 dated 13th January, 1949, and attheir meeting on 17th January (CM. (49) 4th Conclusions, Minute 3) the cabinet agreed that, subject to the views of the United Kingdom fishing industry, the&quot; Yellow Line &quot; should be accepted as a modus vivendi pending further consulta-tion with the Norwegian Government.Representatives of the fishing industry, at a meeting on 17th January,expressed their willingness to accept the &apos;1 Yellow Line &apos;&apos; both as a modus vivendiand as a permanent settlement.6. Agreement on a modus vivendi was of particular urgency in view of thedanger of clashes occurring in the disputed areas, and His Majesty&apos;s government informed the Norwegian Government before the end of January of their willing-ness to accept the &quot; Yellow Line &quot; for this purpose. In spite of constantreminders, however, the Norwegian Government have failed to reach a decision and the question still awaits consideration by the Norwegian Storting. I havemyself raised the matter with the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs atthe time of his visit here in February and again in May. On the latter occasionhe intimated that he had encountered more opposition in Norway than he had expected, but that he still intended to press for a decision from the Stortingbefore it rose in July. Since then, however, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Oslohas reported that M. Lange has already made a further attempt to secure actionin the Storting without any success. It appears, in fact, that opposition to theconclusion of any kind of settlement has increased in the Storting. His Majesty&apos;ambassador now considers that there is practically no chance of the Stortingaccepting even the proposed modus vivendi.7. Meanwhile Norwegian fishery protection vessels continue to interceptour trawlers in waters which we regard as high seas and in which they havebeen accustomed to fish regularly in the past. The patience of our trawlerskippers is thus being severely tried, the more so as His Majesty&apos;s fishery protec-tion vessels are under instructions not to intervene to protect them from arrest.To do so would involve a resort to force, which might adversely affect our case if the matter comes before the International Court, quite apart from its effecton our relations with Norway. We are therefore confining ourselves to lodginga protest with the Norwegian Government in every case that occurs and reservingour full rights to claim compensation. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment clearly cannot abstain indefinitely from exercising their legitimate rights in these waters. Another fishing season is approaching and at present theinterests of our trawlers are being prejudiced, since in practice they are beingexcluded by intimidation from valuable fishing grounds. There are signs thatthe Norwegians are consciously trading on our forbearance in this matter andfeeling in the United Kingdom&apos; industry is beginning to run high. Moreover, thelatest incident, the arrest of the Lord Nufft,eld on 5th May, has evoked consider-able publicity in this country and it is being asked whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are taking adequate steps to protect our trawling interests.8. It is clear, therefore, that the present unsatisfactory situation cannotbe allowed to continue much longer. The Norwegians, however, show no sign ofbeing ready to accept, either as a modus vivendi or a permanent settlement, theproposals which were submitted to them at the beginning of this year (see para-graph 4 above) and which represent the utmost limits of concession to whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government could go. In these circumstances I consider, afterconsultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, that the time has come for His Majesty&apos;s Government to seek a definite solution of the question by informing the Norwegian Governmentthat, unless they come to a decision on the proposed modus vivendi by the end ofJuly, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be obliged to refer the whole case to theInternational Court for settlement. They should further be informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would prefer to do this by means of a special agreement(compromis) agreed with the Norwegian Government, but that failing agreement for this purpose they would do so by unilateral application. If His Majesty&apos;ambassador were able to make a communication in this sense to the norwegian government at an early date, it might even now enable the Norwegian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs to overcome the reluctance of the &quot;Norwegian Parliament toagree to any concession.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,22nd June, 1949.
