HIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 1CP. (49) 1317th June, 1949CABINETSOCIAL SERVICES IN WESTERN europe note by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith a Report by the Official Committee on Social services in Western Europe summarising the work done in the last year to give effect to article II of the Brussels Treaty.2. The Report is in the nature of a bird&apos;s-eye view, and much detail hasbeen omitted in order that a clear picture may be given of the chief matters whichhave been the subject of Five-Power discussion in the social field. Much of thework is unspectacular and calls for steady and patient effort in progressingtowards our long-term objectives, but I fully share the view expressed by theOfficial Committee as to the encouraging nature of the results so far achievedand of the promise which they give of increased future co-operation in this wide field.3. I am also in general agreement with the Committee&apos;s conclusion as to future procedure. It is important, in my view, that the Official Committee should&apos; remain in being and meet periodically, so that the British representatives on thevarious social committees and sub-committees under the Brussels Treaty shouldtake stock of the position, exchange ideas and arrive at a common view on thequestions which are of concern to a number of Departments. I accordingly recommend that the Official Committee should be authorised to continue toexercise these functions of co-ordination and review.4. The relationship of the Brussels Treaty machinery to any correspondingmachinery which may be set up under the Council of Europe poses a numberof difficult questions which are under examination but cannot yet be answered.However, the basic points made by the Committee in paragraph 15 of theirReport will, I think, be generally accepted.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W.1,7th June, 1949.SOCIAL SERVICES  IN WESTERN EUROPEReport of the Official CommitteeIn the year which has elapsed since the first report of the Committee(CP. (48) 131) was considered by the Cabinet (CM. (48) 35th Conclusions,Minute 9), there have been important developments in this field and we have thought it useful to review the position in order to take stock of the progress made and to make recommendations where this seems appropriate and desirableregarding the future.37118 b
2. In our first report we recommended, among other things, that real progress could best be made in the near future by working for broad equality of treatment in the various services and their development along corresponding lines; thatinitially action in this field could best take place among the Brussels Powers;that it was not necessary or desirable at this stage to establish a permanent organunder the Brussels Treaty for dealing with social questions as a whole; and that consideration should, in the first instance, be concentrated on a number of specificsubjects regarding which we made certain suggestions.3. The developments in this first year of activity have, in fact, been onthe lines recommended by us and subsequently approved&quot; by the Cabinet. Thediscussions have been between the Brussels Powers and within the framework of the Brussels Treaty. In general, the objective has been to secure or encouragebroad equality of treatment in the various services and their development alongcorresponding lines rather than to attempt at this stage to establish uniformity in matters of internal administration and so on. In certain fields, particularlyhealth and social security, the immediate objective has also been to establish closelinks between the National services and this has already achieved some notableresults to which reference is made in paragraphs 5 to 13 below. No permanentorgan has been established under the Treaty for dealing with social matters, butit has been found convenient to establish three main Committees reporting tothe Permanent Commission (1) The Committee on Conditions of Work and Social Policy with, among other sub-committees, special sub-committees on social security andman-power questions;(2) The Health Committee; and(3) The War Pensions Committee.Other fields are being covered by ad hoc committees or sub-committees. We wouldmention in particular the committee which is to deal with the question of the rehabilitation and resettlement of the disabled. This committee was firstestablished as a joint sub-committee of the three main committees, but has nowbeen given the status of a full Committee. In the following paragraphs we give some account of the subjects which the principal Committees have covered or are proposing to cover.Committee on Conditions of Work and Social policy. As its first task this Committee has conducted an examination of theposition of the Brussels Powers in relation to the Conventions adopted by theInternational Labour Conference. This examination is nearly complete. It hasshown that there is a substantial harmony in the social legislation of the BrusselsPowers in the field covered by the Conventions. Although it has not, so far,resulted in the ratification of any additional Conventions, certain of them arebeing re-examined with this in mind. The examination has, moreover, enabled the Five Powers to agree upon a common line to be taken in the revision ofparticular Conventions and to discuss ways and means of harmonising their viewson future Conventions and Recommendations. A discussion has already takenplace on certain matters which are on the agenda of the forthcoming session ofthe International Labour Conference. When the examination of the InternationalLabour Conventions is complete it is proposed to proceed to an examination ofthe Recommendations adopted by the Conference.5. Of the other matters which up to the present have occupied the Committeethe exchange of student trainees is perhaps the most important. There is generalagreement that an increase in the movement of student trainees between the fivecountries is most desirable and, while complete agreement has not yet been reached on the best methods of securing this, it has been agreed that the Five powers should take immediately certain steps directed towards this end. Thus in thecase of the United Kingdom it has been agreed to draw the attention of the british employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congress to the importance attached by the Government to this matter, to consult them on certain specific proposals which have been put forward for encouraging and stimulating theexchange of student trainees and to invite their views generally on the mostpracticable ways of achieving progress.
6. The Committee has given some thought to its future work.. It has beguna study of the employment service organisation in the five countries; the nationalrepresentatives are preparing statements on the labour inspection services in their countries; information is to be collected about the statistical data available onwhich certain comparisons regarding cost of living, level of earnings, &amp;c, might be based; and suggestions have.been made concerning other matters which theCommittee might profitably consider. .^&apos; Social Security Sub-Committee &apos;7. Article II of the Brussels Treaty contains, among other things, a specificpledge that the High Contracting Parties will endeavour to conclude as soon aspossible Conventions with each other in the sphere of social security. Theexistence of machinery under the Brussels Treaty has been of positive assistancein the negotiation of such Conventions or &apos;: reciprocal agreements.&quot; The presentposition, so far as Great Britain is concerned, is that an agreement coveringshort-term sickness, maternity, death, long-term sickness, old age and industrial injury insurance, and the corresponding French benefits, was reached with Franceshortly before the Appointed Day, i.e., in June 1948. This agreement is to beput into operation by means of a supplementary agreement which it is hoped to conclude shortly. Arrangements are also being made for the necessary admin-isfrative machinery (which must meet the requirements of both schemes)&quot; to be setup and operated by the respective authorities. The substance of a somewhat similar agreement, but including unemployment insurance, has been successfullynegotiated with Belgium, and the formal document is being prepared. A furtheragreement with the Netherlands on similar lines has reached the same stage, andthere have been preliminary conversations with Luxembourg. When the arrange-ments are complete their general effect will be to ensure that when a person movesfrom one country to the other he can retain in one way or another the rights hehas acquired from his insurance in the first country and can receive benefits inthe second country proportionate to those acquired rights. This is, in itself, a notable example of co-operation on a Five-Power basis and one which will increasein practical importance as the present-day restrictions on movement diminish.Moreover, to the extent, that the social security schemes of the different countries can be linked together by these agreements there is removed one of the main dis-advantages of having separate national schemes existing side by side and differingnot only in matters of detail but even in general principles.8. These bilateral agreements, together with those concluded amongst them-selves by other countries in the group, will form a network which should in itself be sufficient to deal with the great majority of the cases that will arise. Never-theless, a further step is already under active consideration in the Social SecuritySub-Committee, viz., the production of multilateral agreement designed to givethe nationals of any one of the Contracting Parties the benefits of any of the bilateral agreements existing among them, and also to apply the principles ofthese agreements in cases where such nationals are insured in more than two ofthe countries.9. The sub-committee has also considered the International Labour Con-ventions relating to social security and has discussed common problems in thesocial security field arising out of the work of the International Labour Organisa-tion. The I.L.O. is to review the various social security Conventions in the lightof modern developments with a view to securing the adoption by the Conferenceof a revised social security code. It is the hope that despite certain differences of principle, the Five Powers will be able to agree on the line to be adopted at thevarious meetings at which these questions are to be considered.10. Mention should also be made of the setting up of a sub-committeerepresenting the Social Security Sub-Committee and the Public Health Com-mittee which has started to discuss the possibility of conventions for economicand medical assistance for indigent nationals of the five countries resident ineach other&apos;s territories.The Health Committee11.   This Committee has been able to agree upon a series of measures whichwill be of practical benefit to the Five Powers.   The most striking of these is the37118 B 2
agreement which has been reached on the health control of sea and air transport.Under the agreement maritime health declarations are not to be requested fromships sailing between the ports of the Brussels Treaty Powers. Similarly, whilethe efficiency of the present air transport control measures has been maintained,the formalities regarding air health declarations are to be simplified and theresult of this action is that the five countries may be considered as one singleterritory for this purpose also. In addition, a system of direct contact betweenthe public health administrations of the Five Powers has been established withthe object of securing the mutual and rapid exchange of information, particularly as regards protection against epidemics; a programme for the exchange of medical and para-medical personnel has been drawn up for 1949; plans have been dis-cussed for the pooling of certain therapeutical resources in order that patientsbelonging to any one of the five countries should be able to benefit from methodsof treatment available in any of the other countries; and a number of other ques-tions, including the health control of food-stuffs and drinking water, are now tobe examined.Committee on War Pensions12. War pensions differ in a number of respects from other social services.In particular there are no International Conventions on the subject and sincethe great majority of war pensions are in respect of disablement sustained duringservice with the Armed Forces, the State concerned&apos;will normally accept pensionliability wherever the person concerned (or dependant) lives. It follows that thereis only a limited scope for reciprocity agreements. Nevertheless, there is room for closer co-operation in this field by the exchange of information and by the explora-tion of possible methods of increasing reciprocity in the treatment of the severelywar disabled. These questions are being pursued. Mention has already been madein paragraph 4 of the special Committee which is to consider the related subjectof the rehabilitation and resettlement of the disabled.13. This Committee has made a detailed study of the main war pensionsprovisions in the respective countries and there has been a wide exchange of useful information about pension systems. These studies have not yet beencompleted. A number of minor recommendations on the harmonisation of certain points of pensions procedure have been agreed in principle, but as regards theharmonisation of the important differences in the main war pension provisions,e.g., basic rates, the Committee has met with difficulties which so far have provedinsurmountable.General Considerations14. The activities of these various Committees show that the machinery ofthe Brussels Treaty has been a means of securing closer co-operation between theFive Powers and while it is recognised that the development towards uniformstandards of social services in the respective countries is a long-term process, itis clear that certain practical steps have already been taken in that direction. Ifaccount is taken of the relatively short period of time over which these develop-ments have taken place they cannot but be regarded as satisfactory. And it isimportant to recognise that under the impulse provided by the Brussels Treaty,the habit of close consultation between the national services and Departments has begun. Once the habit has formed, it can be expected to yield further importantdevelopments of a co-operative nature in the social and related fields.15. In these circumstances we would not wish to recommend at the present stage any change in the existing machinery through which social matters are discussed between the Brussels Powers. This machinery has been the result ofdevelopment according to the needs of the situation and is sufficiently flexibleto allow7 for further adjustment as the need arises. In due course it will undoubtedly be necessary to consider how the machinery should be adapted inorder best to fit in with the broader structure now envisaged in the Council ofEurope. This is a difficult matter which it is understood will shortly be engagingthe attention of the Permanent Commission and the Consultative Council of the brussels Powers. Some considerable time is bound to elapse before the Secre-tariat of the new organisation in Strasbourg can be created, and it is too early
yet to foresee how the Council of Europe&apos;s machinery will operate. In thesecircumstances we would wish only to express the hope (i) that enlargement of scope to a ten- or twelve-Power basis should stillpermit the close co-operation of the Brussels Powers on all socialquestions which are. specially appropriate for treatment on a five-Power basis;(ii) that the direct contacts and links which have been established betweenthe various national services and departments in the last year should in no way be weakened, nor the habit of close consultation betweenthem lost as a result of whatever similar arrangements may be madeunder the Council of Europe; and(iii) that full advantage would be taken of the experience gained and theinformation compiled in the last year in those fields which it is decidedcould usefully be explored under the aegis of the Council of Europewhen it is in effeotive operation.16. However, the existing machinery under the Brussels Treaty may be adapted in the future, it will remain necessary that from time to time there shouldbe an overall review on the lines of the present review of the position that hasbeen reached in the social field, and it is also clear that there should be in existencemachinery whereby the United Kingdom members on the various Committees canbe kept informed of developments in the various subjects and through which theycan discuss problems which are of concern to more than one Committee. some such matters have already been discussed by us on the Committee on social services in Western Europe, and a common line has been agreed. One suchquestion which is of more than ordinary importance is the need for securingappropriate publicity as the need arises for the achievements of the co-operation in the social field which now exists between the Brussels Powers. It is suggestedthat the Committee on Social Services in Western Europe would be the most convenient method of securing the necessary co-ordination between the interested departments, and it is recommended that continuing arrangements of this kind should be established.-Principal Conclusions17. (1) The progress made in co-operation between the Brussels Powers inthe social field is satisfactory.(2) We do not wish to recommend any change in the present method by whichconsideration is given to social questions within the framework of the brussels Treaty. We suggest (paragraph 15) three points for con-sideration in relating the arrangements to any broader structure underthe Council of Europe.(3) It is essential that continuing machinery should be maintained for theco-ordination of United Kingdom policy on the various Committeesand for the circulation of information between the various Depart-ments concerned. It is proposed, that the Committee on social services in Western Europe should be regarded as the appropriate body for these purposes.
