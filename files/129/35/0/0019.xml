(49) 12921st May, 194931CABINETPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF CIVIL SERVANTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet agreed on 5th February, 1948 (CM. (48) 11th Conclusions,Minute 7), that a Committee should be set up to consider the political activitiesof Civil Servants. Their report has been received and a copy is attached. TheCommittee&apos;s recommendations are summarised on pages 30-32.The Committee recommend one big change, namely, that complete freedom in political activities should be granted to the Post Office Manipulative grades(207,000), to other Minor and Manipulative grades (50,000) and also to allindustrials (i.e., another 200,000 in addition to those in the Service Departmentswho already have this freedom). For the most part, however, the Committee&apos;sreport is devoted to bringing the existing rules and practice up to date andcodifying them in a form appropriate to present-day conditions.In my view the report is a good and sensible document. Moreover, it isunanimous (save on one very small point) and it comes from a strong and impartialCommittee representing all shades of political opinion. No doubt there are somewho would wish that the Committee had gone further on certain points. But inmy view the Government should decide either to adopt the report as a whole as it stands or to reject it. My recommendation to my colleagues is that the report should be accepted.I also recommend that the report should be published and that the Govern-ment should state at the time of publication that they have decided to accept its recommendations.R.

87REPORTTo the Rt. Hon. Sir Stafford Cripps, K.C., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer.I. introduction. In reply to a Parliamentary Question by Mr. H. E. Randall, M.P., onthe 25th February, 1948, asking you whether you had considered the repre-sentations made by the staff side of the National Whitley Council on political activities by civil servants, and whether you had any statement to make, you said:  &quot; Yes. The Government recognise that there is a case for considering whether the present rules require modification. But in a difficult andcontroversial question of this nature they wish to have the advice of anindependent body of opinion and I propose therefore to set up a Committeefor this purpose with the following terms of reference:  &apos; To examine the existing limitations on the political activities (both national and local) which may be undertaken by civilian Governmentstaffs, and to make recommendations as to any changes which may bedesirable in the public interest&apos;.&quot;2. You announced the membership of the Committee in the House ofCommons on the 14th April, 1948. In inviting us to serve, you told us that,whilst the Government agreed that there was a case for investigation, theywould be totally opposed to any radical change in the non-political status of the Civil Service. We were subsequently given to understand that the phrase &quot;civilian Government staffs&quot; in our terms of reference was to be interpreted as meaning the Civil Service; we have accordingly confined out enquiry within that limit, and have not touched upon the position of the staffs of the nationalised industries nor of the local government service. Forthe purposes of our task, we have worked on the basis of the definition ofcivil servants adopted by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (1929-31)(the &quot; Tomlin Commission &quot;), namely &quot; those servants of the Crown, otherthan holders of political or judicial offices, who are employed in a civilcapacity, and whose remuneration is paid wholly and directly out of moniesvoted by Parliament.&quot;3. The political activities with which we have concerned ourselves, as willappear later in the Report, may be briefly summarised under the following headings:  (1) Parliamentary candidature and service ;(2) Other political activities in the national field, both party and non-party in character, by(a) individual civil servants ;(b) members of Civil Service staff associations ;(3) Participation in local government, especially membership of local councils.4. We had our first meeting at the Treasury on the 18th May, 1948, andhave held fifteen full-day sessions since that date. At the outset we issued a press notice inviting evidence from anyone who desired to give it. In thecourse of our sessions, we have heard oral evidence from a number of wit-nesses, including ex-Ministers who have been members of the Civil Service,Heads of Departments, representatives of Civil Service staff associations,5
political theorists and individual civil servants who have wished to submit their views to the Committee. There is a list in Appendix 1. We have also received written evidence from various sources, including information aboutthe practice of the Commonwealth Governments and of other countires overseas, and the views of Local Government Associations in England andWales ; the names of those who have provided us with such, memorandaare given in Appendix 2. We take this opportunity of recording our gratitude to all those bodies and persons who have kindly assisted us in the dischargeof our task.II. PRESENT position. The Civil Service is made up of many grades engaged on a great variety of work. The non-industrial Civil Service at present numbers approximately450,000 members of the Administrative, Executive, Professional, Scientific,Technical, Clerical and Typing grades, together with some 275,000 classified as members of the Minor and Manipulative grades. The great majority ofthe latter are employed in the Post Office, many of them as postmen andtelegraphists, but some of them on Counter Clerk duties. The industrial civil Service numbers about 400,000 persons ; it includes skilled and unskilled workers in the naval dockyards and Royal Ordnance Factories, buildingoperatives, printers, drivers, and labourers, as well as the staff of theEngineering and Factories Departments of the Post Office, and many othermanual grades. A detailed analysis of the various classes is given inAppendix 3.6. The existing rules governing the political activities which may be under-taken by all these staffs are as follows: (i) Parliamentary candidature and service7. Civil servants are generally disqualified by statute from sitting in theHouse of Commons. Since the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, Parlia-ment has passed a series of enactments to avoid the conflict of duties which might be expected to arise if members of the House of Commonsoccupied positions as servants of the Executive. The law on the subjectof &quot; placemen &quot; and &quot; offices of profit &quot; is complicated and in many respectsobscure. It is, however, clear that Parliaments consistent policy has been to prevent members of the House of Commons from holding posts of thekind usually filled by civil servants. This principle has long been accepted as a fundamental feature of the British constitution.8. Apart from the rules which Parliament has laid down regarding itsown composition, the Civil Service also has its disciplinary regulations pro-prohibiting Parliamentary candidature without prior resignation. These regula-tions have not always been comprehensive. A Treasury Minute of 1884,arising out of questions in Parliament at that time, said that the usageof the Public Departments had been for a civil servant seeking a seat inthe House of Commons to resign his office as soon as he issued an address to the electors or in any other manner announced himself as a candidate;and it declared this usage to be binding in the Treasury and in all otherDepartments which depended upon the Treasury for the regulation of theirdiscipline. Later, in 1910, the rule was embodied in an Order in Councilapplicable to all His Majesty&apos;s civil establishments. In 1924 the Chancellorof the Exchequer appointed a committee under the chairmanship of LordBlanesburgh to inquire into the position. The Blanesburgh Committeeunanimously recommended that the existing ban on Parliamentary candidature
without prior resignation should be maintained for the whole of the non-industrial Civil Service. They further recommended that industrial employees in the Service Departments (who, like all industrial civil servants, had hitherto been treated on more or less the same lines as non-industrials in the matterof Parliamentary candidature) should be free to stand as Parliamentary can-candidates without resigning. The Committee was divided on the questionwhether the latter freedom should be extended to industrials employed inother Departments.9. The Government adopted those recommendations of the BlanesburghReport which were unanimous, and to give effect to them the Servants ofthe Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order, 1927, was made (Appendix 4),providing that &quot; No person employed by or under the Crown to whom this order applies shall issue an address to electors or in any other mannerpublicly announce himself, or allow himself to be publicly announced as a candidate or a prospective candidate for election to Parliament until he hasretired or resigned from such employment.&quot;10. Under Clause 2 (c), exemption from the Order was granted to &quot; personsemployed in an industrial capacity in establishments under the Admiralty,Army Council or Air Council, being establishments certified by the treasury to be establishments of an industrial or predominantly industrial character,other than persons employed in such supervisory grades as may be specifiedin regulations made by the department concerned and approved by theTreasury.&quot;11. As a result of this proviso, there are at the present time some 200,000civil servants in industrial establishments certified as exempt from the Order.There are also over 60,000 employed in establishments formerly under theArmy Council or the Air Council and subsequently transferred to theMinistry of Supply who, strictly speaking, became formally subject to theprohibition upon transfer to that Department, although the Ministry has never taken steps, we understand, to enforce the Order in regard to them.In the case of the remaining 130,000 or more working in other industrial establishments, the ban on Parliamentary candidature is generally enforced.12. The position of civil servants who are Peers of Parliament was notreferred to by the Blanesburgh Committee, but is regulated by TreasuryCircular No. 11 of 1928, which accords with the spirit of their Report.Civil Servants who are Peers may attend in their place when their officialduties permit, but may not take part in debate or vote in the House ofLords until they have retired or resigned.13. During the 1939-45 war many of the normal rules governing employ-ment in the Civil Service were in abeyance, and several Members ofParliament and Parliamentary candidates temporarily filled Civil Serviceposts. Shortly before the General Election of 1945, the Coalition Govern-ment reviewed the position and decided that temporary civil servants might,notwithstanding the 1927 Order, be permitted to appear before a selectioncommittee and, if necessary, to address a subsequent adoption meeting,whether held in public or not. They were not, however, permitted to appear on any political platform or to take part in any political propaganda oractivity while they remained in the Civil Service, and, if adopted, they were required to resign from the Service not later than the announcement of thedate of the General Election. This relaxation of the normal rule appliedexclusively to the 1945 election.14. The pre-war rules are now again in force.7
(ii) Other political activities15. The main forms of political activity in the national field, other thanParliamentary candidature, which we have had in mind and to which we shallrefer in this Report as &quot; other political activities &quot; are:  (a) holding office in party political organisations, whether national or local;(6) speaking on public platforms on party political matters;(c) writing letters to the press or publishing books or leaflets on party political matters ;(d) canvassing.16. There exists no universal regulation governing these matters comparable with that for Parliamentary candidature. Civil servants may vote and belong to political parties, but the only all-Service rule on the extent to whichthey may engage in general political activities apart from the overridinglimitations imposed by the Official Secrets Acts is a general exhortation of long standing that &quot;civil servants are expected to maintain at all times areserve in political matters and not put themselves forward prominently on one side or the other.&quot; This rule applies only to non-industrial staff. It ispromulgated in the manual of instructions issued by the Treasury to allEstablishment Officers. Some Departments reproduce it textually in their staff Rule Books ; others have adopted slightly different forms of the rule, aswill be seen from the examples given in Appendix 5. Other Departmentsagain rely on the Handbook for the New Civil Servant, a general publicationfirst issued by the Treasury in 1946, which, in a section on conduct, says that&quot; a civil servant must not take any part in political controversy.&quot; The Hand-book also contains the following relevant extract from the report of a Boardof Enquiry which was set up in 1928 to look into allegations which hadbeen made about the conduct of certain civil servants; and in addition thepassage is included by most Departments in their office instructions:  &quot; There are spheres of activity legitimately open to the ordinary citizenin which the civil servant can play no part, or only a limited part. He isnot to indulge in political or party controversy, lest by so doing he should appear no longer the disinterested adviser of Ministers or able impartiallyto execute their policy. He is bound to maintain a proper reticence in discussing public affairs, and more particularly those with which his own department is concerned.&quot;A Treasury Circular of 1928 instructed Departments to draw the attentionof all members of their staffs to this Report, to incorporate its statement of principles into their rules, and to bring them specifically to the notice ofeach new entrant.17. We have made enquiries into the extent to which civil servants arenow in fact aware of these rules. Apart from one or two new departments which are in the process of drawing up their regulations, the practice of mostDepartments is to issue either a copy of their staff rules or the Handbook forthe New Civil Servant, or both documents, to new staff ; some, but not all,draw specific attention to the general code of Civil Service conduct and require new entrants to sign a statement that they have read these instructions.Since 1939, however, on account of the greatly increased intake of temporary staff and the shortage of paper, a number of Departments have restrictedthe issue of personal copies of such booklets to established staff. Althoughthe rules in one form or another are generally available in all Departments,there may now nevertheless be a number of civil servants who are unaware of them.
18. The detailed application of the rules has always been left to Depart-ments. The Post Office alone has specific regulations; thus since 1923 theyhave allowed all but their most senior grades to take part in canvassing. TheTreasury, when consulted, has, we understand, taken the line that at least the first three activities mentioned in paragraph 15 are incompatible with the rule requiring a reserve in political matters. But varying interpretations ofthe code between one Department and another have led to some uncertainty as to what in fact is allowable and what is not.19. All industrials are completely free from restrictions on all &quot;other&quot;political activities, subject only to the ban on the use of official premises forthese purposes and to observance of the Official Secrets Acts.. (iii) Local government activities20. The only general instruction on the subject of participation in localgovernment by civil servants refers to candidature and service on local councils and is contained in a Treasury Circular of 1909 which left it tothe Head of each Department to determine &quot; whether, and, if so, upon what conditions, an officer of his Department may become a candidate for, orserve on, any local council provided that the duties involved . . . shall not conflict with the personal performance of the officers duties to his Depart-ment&quot;. The Blanesburgh Report recommended that the matter remain one for departmental regulation, pointing out that, whilst the objections to parliamentary candidature did not necessarily apply to local governmentcandidature, it would clearly be wrong to allow candidature in the Depart-ments whose duties consisted largely in the regulation of local authorities.Since the extent to which Departments have contact with local authoritiesvaries greatly, the detailed rules now in operation vary considerably fromDepartment to Department, the Departments which have close contacts with local authorities being more restrictive than others. For example the Ministryof Health, which stands in a special relationship with local government, barsparticipation by all save minor and manipulative employees and typinggrades; the Ministry of Labour forbids its staff to serve on county andborough councils ; whereas the Post Office permits local government candi-dature freely provided that it does not conflict with departmental duties.The regulations of some of the principal Departments are quoted inAppendix 6.21. All industrial civil servants are allowed to take part in local govern-ment activities without any restrictions.22. Departments also have complete discretion as to the amount of &quot; timeoff&quot; which they allow to their employees for local government work. Inreply to a Parliamentary Question on the 20th November, 1945, the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury said: &quot; The existing rule is that service on alocal council should not interfere with a civil servanfs performance of hisCivil Service duties. I do not feel able to give a fresh general instructionon the matter, since circumstances, and particularly the amount of absenceinvolved, vary widely. But I am willing to consider on their merits, in con-sultation with the employing departments concerned, any cases in whichit is thought that time off is being unreasonably refused &quot;. We understand from the Treasury that they normally regard one day or two half-days amonth of special leave with pay as reasonable for non-industrial civil servants.In the case of industrial staff, it was agreed in September, 1947, on the JointCo-ordinating Committee for Government Industrial Establishments that 12days&apos; special leave a year with pay, taken either in whole days or halfdays, might be allowed for this purpose at the discretion of Departments.
III.   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS23. Most of the rules and practices governing participation in political activities are of long standing and date from a time when conditions werein many ways different from those obtaining today. Even since the changesrecommended by the Blanesburgh Committee were implemented rather morethan twenty years ago, the functions of government have greatly altered.It is worth noting here the main developments which have affected thecharacter of the problem confronting us.24. First there has been an immense extension of administrative action.With it, the number of civil servants has increased from about 335,000 non-industrials and 125,000 industrials in 1935 to more than 700,000 and 400,000respectively today. Thus over 1,100,000 people are affected by the presentenquiry. At the same time the Civil Service has been brought into much moreintimate association with the life of every citizen, since the growth has been most pronounced in the field of social services and in the sphere of economic affairs where Government Departments now have to take a far more prominentand vigorous line.25. Secondly, a feature of this extension has been the delegation of powersof both a legislative and a semi-judicial character to civil servants. an increasing amount of administrative action today is done under regulationrather than directly under Act of Parliament.26. Thirdly, whereas in the early years of this century only a few central departments had local officials, there are now many local officials, who, inthe eyes of large numbers of citizens, represent the State. These, as well asthose employed centrally, may, moreover, possess considerable discretionarypower to give decisions affecting the life of the community.IV.   THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST CHANGE27. We understand that the Staff Side of the Civil Service National whitley council have for some time expressed dissatisfaction with the existing situa-tion and have repeatedly made representations urging the removal of the limitations at present imposed upon the political activities of civil servants.We accordingly began our enquiry by inviting evidence, both written and oral,from the National Staff Side who represent all the principal staff associations of the non-industrial Civil Service. We gave them a second hearing beforecompleting our Report. We have received in addition a memorandum andoral evidence from witnesses on behalf of the Association of First DivisionCivil Servants, representing the Administrative grades; we saw themseparately because, although they reaffiliated to the National Staff Side in1948, they had been unaffiliated since 1926. We have also heard a deputa-tion from the Trade Union Side of the Joint Co-ordinating Committeefor Government Industrial Establishments representing the industrial CivilService.28. The National Staff Side in their evidence sought the abrogation of the servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order, 1927. In their view, civil servants, because of their experience of the administrative machine,were particularly well qualified for service in Parliament, and it was bothinconsistent with the natural rights of the civil servant as a citizen, andharmful to the public interest, if he were not allowed to offer himself for thisother form of public service and to serve the community for the time being in another capacity, without being expected to sacrifice his career, securityof employment, and pension rights. The Staff Side therefore proposed thatno civil servant of any grade should in future be prevented from standing
as a candidate for election to the House of Commons and that axivil servantwho was adopted as a Parliamentary candidate should be given the followingfacilities to carry on his political work and at the same time retain his positionas a civil servant:  (a) After adoption as a candidate: up to one month in all of specialleave without pay to nurse his constituency, the period to count for incre-ment and pension, and not to be regarded as breaking continuity ofservice.(b) On contesting an election: one month&apos;s special leave with pay,counting equally for increment and superannuation.,(c) On entering Parliament: special leave for the period of his member-ship, without pay or reckonability for pension, but counting for incrementand not to be regarded as breaking continuity of service.The civil servant would have an unfettered right to stand at his own willand should be free to return to his Civil Service career when he wished.,29. On political activities generally, the Staff Side representatives pressed for the removal of all specific instructions and prohibitions exemplified in existing staff rules, believing it to be wrong in principle, out of tune with current thought, unwise in present-day. conditions, and unnecessary in practice,to prescribe detailed lines of conduct for civil servants in the matter of civilrights. They had no objection to a general convention under which civilservants were expected to behave with discretion,&quot; but they rejected the second part of the existing exhortation that a civil servant should not &quot; put himselfforward prominently on one side or the other.&quot; They proposed, as an alter-native, a new convention in the following terms:  &quot; Civil servants are free to engage in party political activity and it is left to their discretion and good sense to do so with due regard to theirrank, the functions of their Department and their duties in it, on theunderstanding that an officer who by grossly negligent or wilful action orcomment on a matter of party politics creates an intolerable position forhis Department will be liable to disciplinary action.&quot;30. The Staff Side witnesses objected to any interpretation of the conven-tion by way of departmental rules, arguing that the matter could safely beleft to the discretion of each civil servant, who could be relied upon to avoid creating an intolerable position for his Department or giving any real cause for disquiet to the public ; in their view, the risk of this was so slight thatthe time had come to remove all restrictions and to rely on the good sense of- the individual. They accordingly proposed that civil servants of all gradesshould in future be under no disability as to the public expression of their political opinions, except that they should observe the provisions of theOfficial Secrets Acts, and should be required to maintain a proper reticencein matters dealt with by their own Departments and be liable to disciplinary action for indiscreet or ill-judged action.31. As regards participation in local government, the Staff Side thought itincompatible with the rights of the civil servant as a citizen that he shouldbe required to request permission from the Head of his Department to stand for election. They suggested that he should only &quot;notify his intention&quot; to stand, it being then open to the Head of the Department to raise objection in certain exceptional circumstances where there was a special relationship between the officers work and local authorities. If the civil servant desiredto proceed with his candidature notwithstanding any such objection, it wouldbe open to the Departmental Whitley Council to discuss the difference of
opinion and endeavour to resolve it, e.g. by suggesting the transfer of thecivil servant to different work. It would be expected, however, that, ifelected, a civil servant would observe &quot; a proper reticence&quot; over matters with which his Department was concerned, and disciplinary action might be appropriate if he palpably failed to do so. The facilities for a civil servantserving on a local authority should include special leave or time-off with pay as reasonably necessary to enable him to perform his local government duties,and should extend to continuous leave with full pay if necessary in exceptional cases.32. In concluding their evidence the Staff Side observed that the sub-stantial and permanent growth of the Civil Service in recent years made it essential to allow the greatest possible freedom in the exercise of civil rightsby civil servants. They wished, in particular, to record their very strong objection to the reply given by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to a parliamentary Question on the 27th March, 1947, in which he had saidthat he would &quot; regard as improper any public criticism by a civil servantof policy for which a Minister whether of his own or of some other Depart-ment is responsible.&quot; The Staff Side regarded this as a new restriction which,if observed, would preclude any civil servant of any rank in any Departmentfrom joining openly, whether in a personal or in a representative capacity,in the discussion of a great many matters of public interest not involvingparty politics, unless he wished to do so in support of the policy of theMinister concerned ; such a departure would constitute a loss to the national life and was wholly objectionable from the point of view of the individual.33. The Association of First Division Civil Servants gave evidence whichwas limited to their own class, but in other respects was similar in tenorto that of the National Staff Side. We understood the gist of their case tobe that they wished the general position to remain much as at present sofar as the Administrative Class was concerned, but they did not think thatany regulations were required to ensure this result.34. Representatives of the Trade Union Side of the Joint Co-co-ordinating committee for Government Industrial Establishments gave evidence on behalfof industrial employees of the Crown on the question of Parliamentary can-didature. They submitted that the 1927 Order in Council was anomalousand required amendment. They urged that all industrial civil servantswithout distinction should be eligible for candidature for political officewithout being required to resign from their employment. They also urgedthat, if elected to Parliament, industrial civil servants should be grantedunpaid special leave for the duration of their office as members of Parlia-ment with protection of seniority and pension rights and with automaticreinstatement in their previous posts without limit to the length of their absence. They thought the existing arrangements under which industrialselected to Parliament were required to resign from the Service was a deter-rent which, prevented some of the best men from undertaking this publicservice.35. In considering the evidence given by the representatives of the staff associations, we have not attempted to make an accurate estimate, evenwere one possible, of the strength of feeling among civil servants in favourof greater political freedom, because we consider that the question shouldbe settled on its merits and in the light of the principles which we have adopted. It is, however, our duty to record that most Heads of Depart-ments in their evidence were not aware of the existence of any appreciabledissatisfaction among their staffs on this matter. Among official witnesses,those from the Post Office alone told us that any attempt to enforce evenall the existing restrictions rigidly might cause discontent; it is perhaps
91significant that they spoke for a Department employing the largest numbersof staff in the minor grades. Having heard a number of witnesses from different Departments and various grades, we are led to conclude that suchdemand for relaxation as exists will be found chiefly in the lower grades.36. Moreover, most of our witnesses other than those representing theStaff Side organisations, whilst they saw no objections to meeting this demand in the case of the lower grades, spoke against the extension of any such (.concession to the rest of the Service. The general tenor of the evidence fromsenior officials was to the effect that, whilst they were not antagonistic toall change, they were strongly opposed to taking any risk of creating apolitical Service. Whilst they wished to accord all possible liberty to civilservants in the exercise of ordinary citizen duties, they believed that the overriding consideration must be to maintain both the existing reputation of the Service for political neutrality and public confidence in its freedom from all possibility of bias. The Staff Side proposals were in their viewincompatible with this prime necessity. If civil&apos;servants, other than those employed in certain minor grades where the same considerations did notapply, were allowed freely to engage in politics, to stand for Parliament, toreturn to the Service after sitting as M.P.s, and thus to declare their adherence to one party or the other, the public&apos;s belief in their impartiality and Ministersconfidence in their ability to give equally loyal service to whichever party was in power would rapidly be destroyed with disastrous results to theService and to the country. No countervailing advantages would be derivedfrom such a development, and the small loss of freedom which civil servantsvoluntarily accepted upon entering the Service was insignificant in com-parison with the vital importance of preserving so great an asset as a non-political Service. Heads of Departments were agreed that nothing should therefore be done to weaken the traditional reputation of the Service forimpartiality, and this attitude was shared by a number of individual witnessesboth from within and outside the Service. They were emphatic in their belief that there was, especially among the higher ranks, an important bodyof opinion which would look with concern upon any substantial departure from the established practice.V. GENERAL PRINCIPLES37. In the course of our enquiry we have endeavoured always to relate our recommendations to certain principles which we think should be generally acceptable. There are two such principles which we think vital, the first ofwhich tells in favour of the removal of restrictions on civil servants&apos; political activities, the second in favour of their retention. In framing our recommenda-tions we have constantly tried to find a balance between these two conflictingprinciples:  (i) In a democratic society it is desirable for all citizens to have a voice in the affairs of the State and for as many as possible to play an active part in public life.(ii) The public interest demands the maintenance of political impartialityin the Civil Service and of confidence in that impartiality as an essential part of the structure of Government in this country.38. Both these statements of principle need some expansion. The grant ofthe maximum freedom of speech and political activity to all citizens is, webelieve, the ideal to be aimed at in a democratic society. The fact that theCivil Service contains a larger proportion of the population than ever beforeand that it includes a highly educated and intelligent section of the community
makes it obvious that civil servants should not be excluded from full citizen-ship except insofar as other overriding considerations of public interest renderthis unavoidable. For the purposes of our enquiry, however, we have been obliged to distinguish between(a) the free expression of a man&apos;s party-political views in private or^through the ballot-box, and(b) their expression in public for the purpose of propagating the ideas ofa political party.The first is a right universally exercised to-day and though it may here benoted that revenue officers were disfranchised in this country from 1782 to1868 no modern&apos;democratic government could properly interfere with thatright. The second is also a right for the ordinary citizen, but it is in practicerelinquished by many. It is not in our view a right which cannot justifiablybe limited or withheld in certain circumstances by other considerations ifthese are sufficiently important to the public interest as a whole. In theproblem before us this public interest must always be the criterion. it involves, in the words of the Blanesburgh Committee&apos;s Report, &quot; the necessityof maintaining, without possibility of question, the public confidence in thepolitical impartiality of the Public Service.&quot; This need is, we think, axiomaticand will not be disputed. On the contrary, we believe it will be generally agreed that the efficient and smooth working of democratic governmentdepends very largely upon maintaining that confidence and on peoplebelieving that, notwithstanding political change, the Civil Service will givecompletely loyal service to the Government of the day. We think, moreover,that the extension of the functions of the State in the last few decades greatlyincreases the need for maintaining the impartiality of the Service. We have worked upon the assumption that this confidence must be maintained even at the cost of certain sacrifices. Entry into the Civil Service is a voluntaryact and there can be no reasonable complaint if the conditions of serviceinclude some restrictions (as is the case in certain other professions andemployments). The public interest demands, at least amongst those employees of the State who correspond with the common conception of the Civil Service,a manner of behaviour which is incompatible with the overt declaration of party political allegiance.39. This incompatibility is obvious in the case of the Administrative Classwho are the advisers of Ministers and assist in the making of policy. their role in the formulation of policy decisions and their close relationship with ministers clearly require an attitude of mind with which the public advocacyof party political views would be inconsistent. The characteristic which has long been recognised in the British administrator and extolled as a specialvirtue is his impartiality, and, in his public capacity, a mind untinged by political prepossession. Differing in type and mental attitude from thepolitician or the party-man, the civil servant conceives it his duty to advise on the basis of the facts set before him. He does not advocate a particularsystem of political doctrines. Even if his personal sympathies attract himtowards a political party, he does not express those sympathies in public.There is, however, more involved than the mere repression of party views.The Administrative civil servant voluntarily enters a profession in which his service to the public will take a non-political form. It will consist in the wiseand accurate estimation of the reasons for and against a particular course ofaction, formulated not for the purpose of influencing the public mind, butfor the benefit of those who actually have to take decisions. The deliberatechoice of a profession in which he knows that his service to the public willtake this form gives a bent to the mind. It is very unlikely that a civil servant formed by years of training and the exercise of administrative
functions would hold clear-cut party views in the sense of being a consistentsupporter of the entire programme of one party, even if on the whole hissympathies lay with it.40. This impartiality is never questioned by Ministers, by the public, or byother civil servants. In present conditions a Minister coming into a Depart-ment is able to rely on entirely loyal service to his ideas from all civilservants alike. He has no reason even to consider whether any particularcivil servant is, or is not, in sympathy with his political views. He is indeedable to assume that, whatever the civil servanfs sympathies, they would not affect his advice on the facts in any given case. The disadvantages ofdeparting from this position are obvious.41. Only a very small proportion of the Service is, however, in close contact with Ministers. Those who are responsible for advising Ministers amongsta variety of other duties are to be found mainly among the higher Adminis-trative ranks. The whole Administrative Class numbers only about 3,500men and women, most of whom are stationed in Headquarters departments in the Whitehall area. The Departments in which these Administrative staffswork are, however, composed of civil servants organised in divisions orbranches, and made up of members of the various classes Professional,Executive, Clerical and Typing who work together as teams. All of the mare, in differing ways appropriate to the responsibilities of their rank, engagedat different stages on the same blocks of work, and each contributes in varying degree according to his status towards the decisions made by theAdministrative officers or towards the submissions made to Ministers. Therequirements of the work demand this grouping, and a real sense of unityexists amongst the members of these different grades who work together aspart of a single organisation ; we are satisfied that the same basic principlesapply to all of them alike.42. Outside the Whitehall Ministries the Civil Service is a very large andwidely spread body of men and women who are engaged not in advisingMinisters but in the conduct of practical business. They are employed invarious Headquarter branches, such as those of the Admiralty at Bath andthe Ministry of National Insurance at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and in regional and local offices all over the country. In the latter, to a greater degreethan in Whitehall, the work brings all ranks down to quite junior officialsinto intimate relationship with every section of the community. The dutiesperformed by them are broadly of three types, although each merges intothe other:  (a) duties involving the exercise of a large measure of discretion ;(b) duties which, while requiring powers of interpretation in givencircumstances, are closely governed by Acts of Parliament, regulations ordepartmental instructions ;(c) duties of a partially or wholly routine character.In these cases, the essential factor is the relation of civil servants withthe public rather than their relations with the Minister. First the workof these civil servants must in fact be completely impartial. Secondly, thepublic as a whole and the Press must be satisfied in their own minds thatno suggestion of political bias enters into their treatment of individuals.Public opinion is a sensitive barometer reacting sharply to any breaches ofthe traditional impartiality of the Civil Service. The importance of these considerations can hardly be exaggerated today when vital decisions on claims for social benefits, assessment to tax, liability to various forms of nationalservice, entitlement to certain rationed commodities, and many other aspectsof daily life are being taken by officials often of humble rank.  Whether we
consider the man-in-the-street seeking employment, the professional-manapplying for a supplementary allowance of petrol, or the member of thebusiness community dealing with the various economic controls now operated by the Civil Service, the life of every citizen is being directly and acutelyaffected by all grades of the hierarchy. In these circumstances, public faith in the non-political and impartial attitude of the Civil Service as a whole would be quickly shaken if individual civil servants were known or evensuspected, rightly or wrongly, to be not in fact detached from party allegiance.43. There is finally to be considered the harmful effect upon the Serviceitself if the political allegiance of individual civil servants became generally known to their superior officers and colleagues. If a Minister began toconsider whether A, on account of his party views, might be more capableof carrying out his policy than B, the usefulness of B would be limited andthe opportunities of A would be unfairly improved. This would become known, and a tendency to trim the sails to the prevailing wind would be one consequence. Another would be a cynicism about the reasons forpromotion very damaging to morale. If it be thought that we have exagger-ated this risk, we would point to the experience of those countries whichare suffering from the consequences of taking a course different from ourown. The danger is, we believe, a real one. It may result from only smallbeginnings, but, once begun, it produces a snowball effect, which is difficult,if not impossible, to check. Once a doubt is cast upon the loyalty ofcertain individuals or upon the equity of the promotion-machinery, an atmosphere of distrust may rapidly pervade an office and affect the arrange-ment of the work and damage the efficiency of the organisation.44. For all these reasons we are in complete agreement with the views expressed in paragraphs 10-11 of Ch. il of the Report of the MacDonnellCommission, 1914. We consider that their remarks are as true today aswhen they were written:  &quot;In the first place, we have little doubt that complete liberty ofpolitical action for all officials alike would inevitably result in frequentconflicts between the desires and interests of the officer as a citizen andhis duty as an official, and that such conflicts could not fail to have a disastrous effect on the morale of the public service. ... It would, wethink, be disastrous if the feeling should arise that the effectiveness ofa legislative policy were in any degree dependent upon the political biasof those administering it.Speaking generally, we think that if restrictions on the political activitiesof public servants were withdrawn two results would probably follow.The public might cease to believe, as we think they do now with reasonbelieve, in the impartiality of the permanent Civil Service; and ministers might cease to feel the well-merited confidence which they possess atpresent in the loyal arid faithful support of their official subordinates ;indeed they might be led to scrutinise the utterances or writings of suchsubordinates, and to select for positions of confidence only those whosesentiments were known to be in political sympathy with their own.If this were so, the system of recruitment by open competition would prove but a frail barrier against Ministerial patronage in all but the earlier years of service ; the Civil Service would cease to be in fact an impartial,non-political body, capable of loyal service to all Ministers and partiesalike ; the change would soon affect the public estimation of the Service,and the result would be destructive of what undoubtedly is at present oneof the greatest advantages of our administrative system, and one of themost honourable traditions of our public life.&quot;
45. It follows, in our opinion, that the principle hitherto observed in tlheCivil Service, that a civil servant maintains a certain reserve in political matters and does not put himself forward prominently on one side or theother, is plainly right for that part of the Service popularly associated withthe phrase &quot; white collar workers.&quot; The practice of reticence in public isnecessary to the maintenance of this attitude. Nothing crystallizes viewslike the expression of them in controversy, and it would be harder everafterwards for a civil servant to advise his Minister or his senior officers ina sense contrary to the party line if he had once publicly declared hisadhesion to party doctrine. He must regard his powers as an advocate asbeing always at the service not of a party doctrine but of an administrativeideal. There is, of course, also the consideration that, even if he could keephis party views absolutely separate from nis judgment of a particular ques-tion, as some contend he can, it would be almost impossible for him to convince other people that he had done so.46. We have considered the argument advanced by the Staff Side that civil servants themselves can be trusted to exercise political rights in a waynot detrimental to the public interest. This might seem an attractive sug-gestion, but in our view it relies too much on the traditional Civil Serviceattitude to public affairs which has been formed by decades of training and experience under the present convention. It does not follow that ifthe convention were modified civil servants would act and speak with thesame reticence and wariness which they show at present. An announce-ment that civil servants were free to engage in political activity wouldfundamentally alter the point of view of the Service, at all events of itsyounger members. It would undoubtedly be a shock to public opinion,accustomed as it is to.the tradition of a nonnpolitical Service. The Staff Sidethemselves appear to realise the risks inherent in such a change, as theydo not exclude the possibility that individual civil servants, if allowedcomplete freedom, might create an intolerable situation for their pepart-ments and become liable to disciplinary action. A few bad cases whichattracted public attention would reduce public confidence in the Service asa whole. But in our view it would be inequitable to penalise an officer Whoerred in ignorance, and difficult for a Department to take disciplinarymeasures against him if he used his discretion unwisely. It seems to us thatit is in the interests of the individual as well as the Department that thereshould fee some protection against the creation of an intolerable situation,both by a general code of behaviour and, where the need arises, by explicitprohibitions. We see nothing derogatory in the existence of such rules.Moreover, if no rules existed, departmental case law would be bound to grow up out of decisions on individual cases; such decisions would oftenhave to be sought by the staff themselves. We think that many civil servantswould welcome some guidance in advance,47. We have also considered the argument that a feeling of frustrationmay arise among civil servants whose work is of a general routine character,and that this feeling of frustration might be overcome if opportunity weregiven them to embark upon a political life without abandoning the CivilService. We reject this argument. Admitting that there must be &quot;misfits&quot;in all professions, we do not think that this difficulty in the case of the CivilService could best be rectified by an attempt to allow members of it to pursue simultaneously both a political and a Civil Service career. It is better that such misfits should leave the Service altogether. A number of our witnesses have, however, pointed out that the loss of pension under presentsuperannuation arrangements may impose a severe penalty on the older
civil servant who wishes to make a change of career. They have drawn attention to the fact that the cases in which a civil servant might wish to resign in order to take up politics would be very few, and that the transitionwould be made easier by the introduction of a system of proportionatepensions. This suggestion raises issues wider than the scope of our inquiry.We think it right to state, however, that in our view there could be no reasonable sense of grievance except possibly in the case of the sacrifice ofpension in respect of long years of service. Such cases of difficulty will be largely met if the Governments present proposals become law, for, followingan agreement reached between the Official and Staff Sides of the national whitley Council, they&apos; have introduced a Bill for the improvement of theexisting Superannuation Code. Under the proposed reforms, a civil servantwill be able to retire voluntarily at any time after reaching the age of 50without sacrificing accrued pension rights ; in all cases other than those of retirement on compassionate grounds, the accrued pension and additional allowance will be payable at the normal minimum retiring age usually 60.The escape to politics or other fields will thus to this extent be facilitatedin future for those who desire to make the break.48. Our general conclusion is that to preserve the attitude of detachmentin all civil servants in whom its absence might adversely affect the publicservice is so important as easily to outweigh any hardship felt by individuals who are deprived of the freedom to propagate political views among their fellow citizens. It will certainly justify maintaining the deprivation in somecases in which the risk is only slight. The public service should, in our view,consistently be given the benefit of any doubt. Any weakening of the existingtradition of political impartiality would be the first step towards the creationof a &quot; political&quot; Civil Service. As will be seen from Appendices 1 and 2,we have informed ourselves carefully of the effects of such trends in othercountries (and in this country in the past), and nothing in this evidenceencourages us to favour any step, however small, in that direction. Eventhe smallest move down that slope might eventually lead to the evils ofthe spoils system. Though it is impossible to measure accurately the possible effects of changes in the present system in this country, we are convinced thatany such change would be fraught with dangerous possibilities, and that itwould be a retrograde step, detrimental to both the public interest and theinterest of the Civil Service itself. The British Civil Service with its greatreputation and power has a substantial bone in its mouth ; the reflection inthe water, even if it suggests a political flavour, is only a reflection, after all.VI. APPLICATION OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES49. We now turn to consider how far the general principles which we haveenunciated are applicable to the various classes of the Civil Service.50. It has been argued before us that, since the&apos; functions and respon-sibilities of civil servants vary greatly, different rules can, and indeed should,be imposed upon them according to the nature of the duties which theyperform. The principle of political impartiality, runs this argument, doesnot apply to all parts of the Civil Service, because there are clearly staffs whoexert no influence on policy and whose political activities can have no effect upon the reputation and efficient working of the Service. We have endeavoured to determine how far this line of argument can be followed.IB
51. Two possible approaches have presented themselves:  (i) First, it has been suggested that it would be desirable to differentiate between various Departments, allowing those more closely concerned withpolicy matters less political freedom than the others.(ii) Secondly, it has been argued that a distinction should be drawn between senior officers on the one hand and subordinate grades on theOther on the ground that in the case of the latter a far greater measure of freedom could be allowed without danger to the public interest.52. We have examined the first proposition and have reached the con-clusion that, so far as national politics are concerned, no such simple methodof differentiation would be workable, even if it were thought desirable.53. On the other hand, we have come to the conclusion that it is bothpossible and necessary to draw a horizontal line of demarcation through thewhole Service, putting above the line those who, because of the nature oftheir work, must be excluded from party-political activity, and putting belowit those to whom freedom to engage in political activities could be grantedwithout prejudicial consequences. Even this form of differentiation cannotbe applied entirely without exceptions, to which we shall refer later, but we regard this approach to the problem as the most satisfactory. We shalldescribe the two parts of the Service as that &quot; above the line&quot; and that&quot; below the line.&quot;54. For the purpose of this method of treatment, we have analysed theCivil Service into the following main groups on the basis of their approxi-mate numbers in January, 1949:  Administrative,    Professional,    Scientific,    Technical,Executive, Clerical and Typing Grades...      ......   451,000Minor and Manipulative grades excluding the Post Office    56,000Post Office Manipulative grades   ............   220,000Industrials     ......................   408,000(i) Industrials55. Looking broadly at the above groups, we think that we can at oncedivide off the Industrial Civil Service from the Non-industrial. The industrialgrades are composed of more than 400,000 men and women engaged on allkinds of industrial processes: 280,000 of them work in Royal Naval Dock-yards, Depots and Factories, in War Department workshops, repair shops,and storage and similar establishments, in R.A.F. Maintenance Units, inthe Royal Aircraft Establishment and in Royal Ordnance Factories.  Of theremainder, half are employed in the Engineering, Factories and StoreDepartments of the Post Office, and most of the rest are labourers underthe Ministry of Works and the Forestry Commission.   They do not differ from the industrial population of the country as a whole and belong to thesame Trade Unions as their fellow-workers in outside industry.  The public would, we believe, regard it as somewhat artificial to consider this large body of workers as forming part of that Civil Service in the sense in whichthe term is commonly accepted.  From the point of view of political activi-ties, we think it will be generally agreed that they present no real difficulty,and we propose therefore to deal with their position first, turning after-wards to the much more difficult problem of the rest of the Service, andexamining how far, if at all, it may be treated on similar lines.
56. All industrial civil servants are already completely free from restric-tions on political activities, other than Parliamentary candidature. Industrialemployees in predominantly industrial establishments under the service departments can stand for Parliament without resigning, but have to resignif elected. We consider that industrials employed in establishments trans-ferred to the Ministry of Supply should have their position in this respectformally regularised by bringing them into line with the Service Depart-ments, and we think that the existing distinction between establishmentscertified under the 1927 Order in Council and uncertified establishmentsmight be abolished. The objections felt by members of the BlanesburghCommittee to extending the same rights to all industrials seem to us tohave lost their force now that industrial staffs are more highly organised and now that Departmental industrials have probably greater cohesion with industrial employees in other Departments than with other grades in theirown Department. We therefore recommend that all industrials be allowedto stand for Parliament without resigning, unless and until elected. Weconsider that special leave should be granted for a period of one monthprior to the date of the election.57. A number of witnesses have urged that a necessary corollary to thisproposal would be the guarantee of reinstatement to a successful candidatewho is subsequently defeated at a later election. They have also pointedout that the grant of established status to a far larger proportion ofindustrials than was the case in the past is an important new factor in thesituation. Whilst we recognise that a measure of reinstatement would be reasonable we do not think that it should be automatic, since there mightbe cases where an industrial had given only a short period of service beforeentering Parliament, or where his absence had been.so long that he had losthis skill and could not be readily&apos;fitted in to the cadre of his establishment.We therefore recommend that, in the case of permanent employees, thereshould be a right to reinstatement where a man has had ten years&apos; serviceprior to his election and has not been absent in Parliament for more than five years. In all other cases, sympathetic consideration should be given,wherever possible, to applications for permission to return to employmentin the Service.(ii) Minor and Manipulative Grades (other than those employed by thePost Office)58. We have next considered whether any groups of civil servants at presentclassified as non-industrial may be treated for the purposes of political activity in the same way as the Industrial Civil Service. This leads usnaturally to consider the Minor and Manipulative grades, and we shalldeal first, for convenience, with those employed outside the Post Office. Thesenumber about 56,000. The majority are messengers, porters and cleaners,and there are smaller numbers of Ordnance Survey mapping staff, progress-men and other non-industrial supervisory staff in the Royal OrdnanceFactories, clerks of works, storeholders and barrack- and station-wardens,museum attendants, park-keepers, launch-crews, and other miscellaneousgrades listed in Appendix 3. Their duties are roughly described by theirnomenclature and there is little which is discretionary in their work. Inmany ways they are closer to the industrial grades than to the non-industrial,and there would be very little, if any, scope for damage to the publicinterest if they were allowed to be active in support of one or other of thepolitical parties. The evidence which we have heard has established to oursatisfaction a case for assimilating all these grades (with certain small but important exceptions mentioned below) to the position which industrials
now enjoy in the sphere of political activities generally and which we have recommended they should all enjoy in future in regard to parliamentary candidature.59. We do not advise, however, that this recommendation should extend to the Constabularies employed by the Service Departments. They differ from other Minor and Manipulative grades in forming a disciplined as wellas a uniformed force, and, although not so intimately concerned with public order as the ordinary civil Police, they are, as far as concerns our enquiry,in much the same position. The possible effect on the confidence placed in them if they were allowed to take an active part in politics is obvious ;it would not be long before the suspicion arose that political affinities wereaffecting their judgment in the discharge of their duties. We do not, there-fore, think that this body of men should be excepted from the generally recognised rule that a policeman should play no part in politics.(iii) Post Office Manipulative Grades60. The largest numbers of Manipulative civil servants are to be found inthe Post Office who employ approximately 220,000 men and women in thesegrades. Apart from some 13,000 messengers, paperkeepers, and cleanerswho correspond with the general grades employed elsewhere, the greatmajority are classified in grades peculiar to the Post Office telegraphists,telephonists, postmen and sorters. Most of them are performing duties similarto those of the Minor grades in other Departments and their work is largelymanipulative in the literal sense. For political purposes they cannot be dis-distinguished from the preceding category.61. There are however among them some 20,000 Counter Clerks whoseduties are in some &quot;respects not far removed in character from those of ClericalAssistants elsewhere or from those of some of the officers dealing with thepublic in Food Offices and Employment Exchanges. Were it not for thefollowing considerations (1) that there is considerable intermixture ofgenuinely manipulative duties with themiinor clerical work ; (2) that the PostOffice staff are engaged in business transactions with the public rather than with the discretionary administration of regulations ; (3) that the classification of all these staffs together as Minor and Manipulative is of very long standing,we should have felt that a line had to be drawn through the class leavingabove the line those whose duties approach the clerical. As it is, we are ofopinion that the position of Post Office Manipulative staff, with the exceptionof the supervisory grades mentioned below, should be assimilated to theposition of industrials. We are aware that this conclusion may appeardoubtful in the light of the experience of certain countries in which the postal services have tended to become part of a spoils system. The widespreadcharacter of the service and the continual contact between some of its staff and the public make it attractive from the point of view of those who may wish to reward supporters of their party. In this country, however, we feelthat reliance can be placed upon the strong position of the Civil service commission, the well established tradition of non-political appointment andpromotion and the attitude of the Unions, to prevent any development ofthis kind.62. The supervising staff referred to in the preceding paragraph numberabout 8,000 on the postal and telegraph side and 4,000 on the telephone side.The evidence submitted by the Post Office was to the effect that it would bedifficult both in logic and in practice to distinguish between these supervisorsand the rank and file, since, under Post Office practice, a number of thelatter are paid allowances for doing part-time supervising duties and there
is a regular system of substitution (known as &quot; acting up &quot;) by which membersof the basic Manipulative grades from time to time cover temporary vacancies in one grade above. The Post Office therefore submitted that only HeadPostmasters (who are classed as Executives), and Postmasters and AssistantPostmasters (who are classed as Minor and Manipulatives) should be placedabove the line.63. If this suggestion were followed, ail the remaining supervisors in thePost Office Minor and Manipulative grades would be given the benefit ofthe relaxation proposed for Minor and Manipulative staff generally. we agree that the three senior grades referred to by the Post office should be excluded, but we see some difficulty in adopting the rest of their proposal.The other supervisory grades include such ranks as Chief Superintendents,Superintendents and Higher Grade Supervisors in charge of telegraph and cable rooms, of wireless establishments and of telephone exchanges, and of counter and Writing staffs, and inspectors in control of sorting offices.Although these are described in the Civil Service Staff Record as Minor andManipulative grades, we do not accept the term as a proper description oftheir duties. These higher supervisory grades exercise considerable responsi-bility, often of a managerial kind, and the importance of their duties is reflected in their salary scales, many of which range above  500 a year andsome of which exceed  800 at the maximum. Although we all wish to grantpolitical freedom wherever it can be given without detriment to the publicinterest, we have not been able to reach unanimous agreement that all these officers should be placed below our line of demarcation. The majority of usfeel that it would be anomalous to treat them in the same way as the rank and file and that to do so would provoke the risk of repercussions upon othergrades elsewhere in the Service. The rest of us, favouring as simple a lineas possible, consider the Post Office as sui generis and think that a compara-tively small anomaly in this case would be unlikely to cause difficulties inother Departments. We have not attempted to draw a line through this groupother than that proposed by the Post Office, but it may be that one drawnimmediately above the first-line supervisory grades would, if practicable, offer a reasonable solution to the problem.64. If our proposals are accepted, all Minor and Manipulative civil servants(apart from the exceptions referred to above) will be put into precisely thesame position as industrials. They will enjoy the freedom already possessed by industrials to engage in all forms of political activity, national and local,and they will receive in addition the concessions which we have recommended for ail industrials. They will thus be at liberty henceforth to stand for parliament without prior resignation and will be given the opportunity ofreinstatement, after serving in Parliament, on the same terms as we have proposed for industrials in paragraph 57.(iv) The Rest of the Civil Service65. We are now left with those classes which correspond with most people&apos;sidea of the Civil Service the Administrative, Executive, Professional, Scien-scientific, Technical, Clerical and Typing. All these, after much examination,. we have included in that part of the Civil Service above our line of derhar-cation. We have considered whether a line can be drawn through thisupper group, those below it being given more freedom than those above it.It may be admitted that there is great difference between the various dutiesof all these grades, and that many individuals within them (such as, forinstance, certain scientific staff working in research establishments or clerksemployed in offices remote from policy-making) could perhaps be safely
allowed more political liberty. We have, however, met very formidabledifficulties in trying to draw any such distinctions, and we have been im-pressed by the following arguments which have been put before us:  (i) All these grades from Administrative to Typing form an entity. their members work together in each office as part of a single organisation.It would be quite unrealistic today to think of Executive Officers andClerks merely as carrying out the orders of Administrative staff; it wouldbe equally artificial to distinguish between clerical and typing staff because etheir duties tend to be less differentiated than in the past and their pay-scales are closely interlocked. An avenue of promotion exists throug hall these grades. All form an integral part of a homogeneous whole, andto draw a line through them would be arbitrary and would create a false distinction. Moreover, the team-spirit amongst them is strong, andsuch a line would be contrary to the traditions of the Service and, webelieve, to the wishes of the Staff Side and the staff themselves alike.(ii) The increasing interchange of staff between Departments would makeit difficult to give exceptional treatment to staff employed for the timebeing on routine duties remote from politics.(iii) Promotion might bring an individual into a position in which hewould have to relinquish political activity which might previously havebeen unexceptionable and, though such renunciation might be perfectlyfeasible, the individuaFs past associations might well continue to beremembered.(iv) From the point of view of public confidence, no clear distinctioncould be drawn between different grades, since the public might attach importance to the views of even a very junior official especially oneemployed in a Whitehall Department.(v) Large numbers of quite junior staff (especially in the clerical grades)have now frequent contact with the public and are taking decisions, witha greater or less degree of discretionary power, which intimately affectthe lives of the average citizen.66. We have accordingly reached the conclusion that, if exceptions weremade in certain cases, though they might benefit a few individuals, theywould have a wholly disproportionate effect upon public confidence, and thepossible damage done to the public service v/ould be immensely greaterthan any corresponding gain which could accrue. For these reasons we donot think that any distinction should be made between the Administrative,Executive, Professional, Scientific, Technical, Clerical and Typing Classes onthe basis of their grading or duties, and we recommend that all, without exception, should be placed above the line of demarcation.67. We now propose to consider under the following headings the natureof the. limitations which must continue to be imposed upon all those gradesabove the line of demarcation which we have suggested:  (A) Parliamentary candidature and service.(B) Other political activities in the national field.(C) Public affairs of a non-party character.(D) Activities as members of staff associations.(E) Participation in local government.
(A) parliamentary candidature and service58. We recommend that the existing rules forbidding civil servants to standibr Parliament until after resignation from the Civil Service be retained inthe case of all those above the proposed line. We see no reason for modi-fying the present position in this respect. In our view it would be impos-sible to reconcile with the Service tradition of impartiality the idea of a civil servant &quot; above the line &quot; becoming a Member of Parliament and laterreturning to the Service. In the case of officers working in close contact with ministers this proposition appears to us to be self-evident. It is incon-ceivable to us that an Administrative officer should be granted special leave to fight an election, sit as a Member of Parliament and later return toserve under a Minister whose policies he had either denounced or sup-ported in public. The same arguments would apply even were he unsuc-cessful in his candidature. For the reasons given in paragraphs 65-66 we find the drawing of a line of distinction between the Administrative andother Classes in this group both impracticable and undesirable. Werecommend no relaxation of the present rule for any of them.69. We recommend that the irule which has existed since 1920, underwhich civil servants who are peers of Parliament may attend in the Houseof Lords when their official duties permit but may take no part in debatenor vote, should be maintained.(B) other political activities in the national field70. Political activities of a party character should in our view be treatedbroadly on the same lines as Parliamentary candidature and we therefore -recommend no relaxation of the existing code. At the same time itsobscurity is unsatisfactory and requires clarification. In our attempts toredefine the convention, we have endeavoured to keep a balance betweennot leaving civil servants in doubt as to what they may do on essentialpoints and on the other hand laying down a very detailed code which wouldprobably be more restrictive than is necessary. We would accordinglyfavour the substitution of a rule on the following lines for the presentvarying ones:  &quot; Civil servants employed in the minor and manipulative grades (withcertain exceptions) or in the industrial grades are free to engage in political activities subject to the following overriding considerations:  (a) They must not participate in such activities while on duty, while on official premises, or while wearing official uniform ;(b) They must observe the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts.Members of all other grades must maintain a reserve in political matters.So far as national politics are concerned, they must abstain from any public manifestation of their views which might associate them prominentlywith a political party. They may not:  (a) Hold any office (such as that of president, chairman, secretary,treasurer or committee member) in any party political organisation,national or local; &apos;(b) Speak in public on matters of party political controversy ;(c) Write letters to the press, publish books or articles, or circulateleaflets setting forth their views on party political matters ;id) Engage in canvassing in support of political candidatures.&quot;
(C) public affairs of a non-party character71. Though we are convinced that it is imperative that civil servants abovethe line should not take part in party political controversies, we should be lothto recommend the curtailment of the free expression of opinion by any citizenon matters which can be regarded as only incidentally or partially party-political in nature ; these are numerous now that the activities of governmentimpinge upon the life of the citizen, directly or indirectly, at almost every point. We would instance the case of a national beauty spot threatened bysome Government proposal to construct, for example, a factory or a bombingrange. Many such matters have no party political connection. We should think it wrong for a member of the Department concerned to commentpublicly on a proposal of this kind. On the other hand, we should not thinkit wrong for a member of another Department to express his views in printor on a public platform, even though they were in opposition to theGovernments proposal provided that the matter was one of public interest,that the civil servant wrote or spoke in his private capacity, and that he observed a becoming moderation.72. We have been given to understand that, after the Financial secretary had stated in the House of Commons that he would regard as improper any public criticism by a civil servant of policy for which a Minister whetherof his own or of some other Department was responsible, the National staff side received an assurance that he had no intention of changing the position which had existed hitherto. None the less, we feel bound to record that the reply (which remains the latest Ministerial pronouncement on the subject in Parliament) appears to have given a general impression of having imposed a new restriction. If it wrere observed to the letter, civil servants would be deprived of some of the privileges of criticism normally exercised by the citizen, without, we believe, any corresponding advantage to the Service.We consider that there should be no rule forbidding them to express opinionson questions of public interest, except where their own Department is directly concerned, or where the matter has become one of party controversy. Inour view, an adequate safeguard would be given if the convention of reservewhich we have proposed were maintained among civil servants in suchmatters. If they were in doubt, they should seek the views of the Head oftheir Department through their Establishment Officer.73. In this connection, we think that a reference would be appropriateon the question of participation by civil servants in outside conferences. Thepresent rule laid down by the Treasury is that civil servants are not toaccept in their official capacity invitations to attend conferences convenedunder the aegis of political organisations. In the case of conferences wherethe subjects discussed do not possess a political aspect, however, civil servantsmay be permitted to attend, provided that the Head of the Department is satisfied both as to the character of the conference and as to the advantagelikely to accrue to the Department. But the rule normally limits them toattending only as observers, and, where they are allowed to take part in discussions, it may be only to the extent of intervening on questions of fact.The object of this rule is apparently to ensure that officers attending con-ferences should so conduct themselves that there is no ground whatever foran impression to be gained that their Department has been associated withthe conclusions reached in the discussions.74. We understand that the Treasury favours a liberal interpretation ofthe rule, wherever possible, except where the subject of discussion is stillin the realm of unresolved or undisclosed policy, and also that more latitude
is generally allowed where temporary officials receive invitations connected!with their outside experience or previous activities. Nevertheless, it hasbeen represented to us that certain Departments have put an unduly restric-tive interpretation upon this rule, the phraseology of which perhaps lendsitself to an interpretation of this kind. Our own view is that nothing butgood can result from greater contact between civil servants and the rest ofthe community. In this connection it must be remembered that the CivilService nowadays contains a large number of scientists and technicians who should be able to make a contribution to learning by writing or taking partin discussions and conferences. Restrictions upon the attendance of civilservants at outside conferences, if applied too rigidly, go beyond the require-ments of political neutrality. Within the framework of our proposals for ensuring that neutrality, and subject to the observance of the Official secrets acts and the code of reserve proposed, we recommend that there should be greater freedom in this field of professional and non-political public affairs,where civil servants can learn much and contribute much, the only safeguardrequired being that they must make it clear that they speak for themselves and not for their Departments.(D) activities as members of staff associations75. For a number of years there has been a tendency on the part ofcertain Civil Service staff associations to take some part in political con-,troversies and for their delegates to make speeches of a party character attheir annual conferences. Instances of this kind occurred even while theTrade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927, was in force, although Section 5of that Act prohibited established civil servants from belonging to associationswhich were associated with political parties or from being members of asso-ciations affiliated to organisations containing non-civil servants. Such utter-ances have sometimes been made during discussions of highly controversialpolitical topics (such as the foreign policy of successive Governments) andhave attracted a certain amount of publicity. In a number of cases theyhave been delivered by paid officials of the association, but some have beenmade by serving civil servants.76. It is clear that the traditional attitude of the authorities has been oneof reluctance to concern themselves with proceedings at association con-ferences or with the activities of civil servants acting as association delegates.They have therefore ignored a number of speeches made on such occasionswhich were inconsistent with the general rules governing the political activitiesof civil servants. We imagine that this attitude by authority has been basedon the view that association activities are best left to the control of the associations concerned and to their sense of responsibility and propriety, andthat it is only in the last resort that there should be any interference in association affairs. No doubt in extreme cases, notwithstanding this generalpolicy, the authorities might feel it necessary to intervene.77. We can see some reason for this attitude in view of the encouragementgiven to the staff to organise themselves in associations, and the usefulnessof associations for the purpose of joint discussion of conditions of work.We understand too that, although there have been some examples of speechesat association conferences which could not be reconciled with the existingrules, the associations generally have shown restraint and good sense in thesematters.78. If the Government adopt the recommendations which we are putting forward and accord freedom in political matters to all industrials and tothe great majority of members of the Minor and Manipulative Grades, no
problem of the present kind as regards association activities should arise in the case of associations representing those grades.79. The position of civil servants &quot; above the line &quot; is different. Underthe law as it now stands, it remains open for associations of these classesof civil servants to affiliate not only to the T.U.C. but also to a party political organisation. We do not discuss in detail the advantages and the disadvan-tages which are consequent upon the repeal of the 1927 Act, a course decided upon by the Government as recently as 1946. Nevertheless, we feel obligedto point out that, if civil servants &quot; above the line &quot; accept the position of delegates to a party political conference, they may well be involved in a conflict of loyalties. As delegates they may be instructed, for example, toattack the general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government; as civil servantsit would be their duty to abstain from criticism of this nature. In the cir-cumstances we do not recommend that any new prohibition should be imposed upon serving civil servants who are delegates to conferences atwhich political matters are discussed, but they should understand that theywould be expected to pay regard to the rules embodied in paragraph 70 offcrnr recommendations as a general guide to the way in which they should conduct themselves; and it should be understood that disciplinary action may follow if a delegate by his speeches creates a situation embarrassing forthe Service.80. We wish to make it clear that nothing in our foregoing remarks applies to the discussion of questions affecting conditions of service or other normal trade union matters, which is on an entirely different footing.(E) participation in local government81. We have reserved for final consideration the difficult question of participation in local government, and especially service on local Councils,by that part of the Civil Service &quot; above the line &quot;.82. There has been a substantial change in the character of local govern-ment since the issue of the Treasury Circular of 1909 which left it to Depart-merits to settle whether, and on what conditions, members of their staffsmight take part in local government activities. Our witnesses have testifiedto the fact that in recent years local elections have been conducted to an increasing extent on party political lines. Although in a number of areas,particularly in country districts and on a number of authorities such asParish Councils, the party lines do not yet operate, it is undeniable thatin many others candidates have little or no chance of being elected unless they run on a party ticket, and, when elected, they have to accept a partywhip. Thus local government tends nowadays more and more to be organised on party political lines corresponding to those of national govern-ment, and, if this trend continues, it seems likely that within a few years,all local government may be run on a purely party basis. There would belittle, if any, distinction between Parliamentary and local elections in theindication which they gave of candidates&apos; political opinions. We doubt,however, whether this position has yet been reached.83. There is much to be said for treating participation in local governmentin the same way as participation in national politics. If this policy were adopted, the whole of the Civil Service &quot; above the line &quot; would be debarred from taking part in local government where their participation necessarilyinvolved them in party affiliations. It would then remain open to civilservants of these grades to stand in local elections and sit on local Councilsprovided that they did so as Independents and avoided any overt adherence to a political party.
84. For various reasons, however, we have felt averse from advocating thiscourse unless it were found to be inescapable. Ideally an arrangement per-mitting only Independent candidature would offer the only solution. Butwe are compelled to recognise that the number of places in which anIndependent would stand any chance of election is diminishing, and, even ifhe succeeded in his candidature, it would not always be easy for him tomaintain his independence afterwards. Most of us believe that a rule whichpermitted Independent candidature only would be difficult to administer and often hard to comply with. Some of us believe that it would be unrealisticand that any regulation so conceived would be in effect an illusory con-cession. We have regretfully reached the conclusion that the problem should not be resolved in this way.85. Moreover, in our enquiry, we have been impressed by a numberof other considerations. In the first place, the arrangements which haveexisted for the last 40 years have permitted a number of civil servants to engage in local government, and, although the total is not great in com-parison with the size of the Civil Service as a whole, it is not negligible.Witnesses have told us that civil servants can make a valuable contributionto the work of local Councils without causing any loss of confidence in theimpartiality of the Service. We should be sorry io recommend bringing toan end an arrangement which has not given rise to abuse and indeed,we think it would be impolitic and vexatious to do so. Secondly, we havebeen impressed by the argument that it is highly important to maintain thestandard of local government. Its efficiency depends in large measure uponthe unpaid work of public-spirited men in their leisure time ; civil servants,by their experience and educational qualifications, are well equipped tocontribute to local administration, and it would be a loss to the country if local authorities were deprived of the skilled assistance of those few civilservants who can give the time necessary for this work. Thirdly, civilservants who are at present active in local government have said in evidencethat their official work has benefited from the experience which they have acquired in local administration. For, in spite of the frequent necessity ofa party label in contesting an election, it remains true that there is aconsiderable sphere of useful day-to-day administration where party issuesdo not predominate and where the civil servant, after election, can play a useful role. Finally, we have been influenced by our first principle inparagraph 37 that there is an intrinsic gain in allowing freedom wherever possible.86. The imposition of a rule forbidding party candidature would reducethe number of those who could reasonably hope to secure election and therebydiminish the advantages to which we have referred. On the one hand, wethus have the fact that in the past the existing system has resulted in a certaingain both to the Civil Service and to local government itself. On the otherhand, there is the fact that, though any loss of reputation of the Service forimpartiality seems so far to have been negligible, the possible future loss in a changed and still changing situation may be of a quite different orderof magnitude. We feel it impossible in present circumstances to make a recommendation of a permanent nature. That, however, is not necessarilyto say that some radical change is necessary at this moment. We havereached the conclusion that the existing arrangements should continue, foran experimental period of five years, subject to the substitution of a general rule for the whole Service in place of departmental rules. During that periodwe recommend that as much freedom as possible should be granted to civilservants who may wish to engage in local government, and at the end of
that time we recommend that the position should be reviewed. During thisexperimental period, the situation should be governed in the following way.87.. Civil servants above the line of demarcation who wish to take partin local government should be aware that permission to do so would besubject to their being able to abide by the following rule. If they feel ableto comply with its provisions, they should apply to their EstablishmentOfficer for permission from the Head of their Department to stand for local office.&quot; Civil servants above the line may become candidates for election or may accept co-optation to local Councils provided that the permission ofthe Head of their Department is first obtained. Whilst standing for election,canvassing, and serving on such Councils, they are bound by the conven-tion requiring a reserve in political matters and they must avoid becoming involved in national party political controversy. This is not, however,intended to preclude them from speaking in public, writing to the press, orcirculating leaflets setting forth their views, so long as they confine them-selves to local issues and act with the moderation expected of their profes-sion. They may not engage in canvassing for or overt support of other party candidates for local government office.&quot;88. Heads of Departments should retain their discretionary power to grantpermission to members of their staff &quot; above the line &quot; to stand for local office. But they should consult together and with the Treasury in order tosecure a greater degree of uniformity in the exercise of their discretionarypower, and when considering applications they should take into account such considerations as whether, owing to the rank and duties of the applicant,embarrassment might be caused to the Department, whether the applicantproposes to sit on a Council in the same area as that in which he works,or whether the demands likely to be made upon official time would be excessive and detrimental to efficiency.89. Heads of Departments should at the same time draw up a list of those departments whose staff, either wholly or partially, on account of their special relationship with local authorities or the exceptional nature of their work,should be excluded from participation in local government.90. As regards the question of &quot; time off &quot; to enable successful candidatesto discharge their local government obligations, we understand that thereis no dissatisfaction with the existing practice, under which special leavewith pay is normally given up to a maximum of 12 days (or the equivalent)in a year subject to departmental discretion, and we consider that this is reasonable.91. We recognise that experience during the next five years may show that local government politics have become so closely identified with national party politics that it is no longer possible to maintain the distinction which wehave drawn and that it may then be necessary to withdraw the liberty whichwe have recommended. It is for this reason that we have recommended thatthe position be reviewed in five years&apos; time.VII. GENERAL92. In the course of hearing evidence, v/e have met the argument that civilservants are not always fully conscious of the implications of their positionin relation to politics when joining the Civil Service. Our own investigationslead us to believe that all but a very few understand the existing rule, andthat hardly any are deterred from entering the Service by the restrictions
now imposed. Nor do we think that those few who are deterred would necessarily make the best civil servants. We recommend, however, in orderto avoid any doubt or ambiguity, that a full statement of the rules be sentto all successful candidates for the Civil Service when appointment is offered to them.93. We suggest that this statement might be on the following lines:-(1) Civil servants employed in the Minor and Manipulative grades (withcertain exceptions) or in the Industrial grades :These are free to engage in political activities, national and local, subjectto the following overriding considerations:(a) They must not participate in such activities while on duty, while on official premises, or while wearing official uniform ;(b) They must observe the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts.(2) Members of all other grades :These must maintain a reserve in political matters.So far as national politics are concerned, they must abstain from any public manifestation of their views which might associate them prominentlywith a political party. They may not:  (a) Issue an address to electors or in any other manner publiclyannounce themselves, or allow themselves to be publicly announced,as candidates or prospective candidates for election to Parliament until they have retired or resigned from their office ;(b) Hold any office (such as that of president, chairman, secretary,treasurer or committee member) in any party political organisation;national or local;(c) Speak in public on matters of party political controversy ;(d) Write letters to the Press, publish books or articles, or circulateleaflets setting forth their views on party political matters;(e) Engage in canvassing in support of political candidatures;They may become candidates for election, or may accept co-optation,to local Councils provided that the permission of the Head of their Depart-ment is first obtained. Whilst standing for election, canvassing, andserving on such Councils, they are bound by the convention requiring areserve in political matters and must avoid becoming involved in nationalparty political controversy. This is not, however, intended to precludethem from speaking in public, writing to the Press, or circulating leafletssetting forth their views, so long as they confine themselves to localissues and act with the moderation expected of their profession. Theymay not engage in canvassing for or overt support of other party candi-dates for local government office.VIII.   SUMMARY OF conclusions. The political neutrality of the Civil Service is a fundamental feature of British democratic government and is essential for its efficient operation.It must be maintained even at the cost of some loss of political liberty by certain of those who elect to enter the Service. Our problem has been to reconcile the preservation of the existing confidence in the traditionalimpartiality of the Service with the grant of freedom to exercise ordinarycitizen rights to as many employees of the State as is compatible with the reputation of the Service for political impartiality.   (Paragraph 37.)
2. We think that a distinction can be made for this purpose between thosegrades whose participation in political activities might imperil public con-fidence and the efficiency of the Service, and those whose activities wouldinvolve no such risk.   (Paragraph 53.)3. We accordingly recommend that a line of demarcation be drawn belowthe Administrative, Professional, Scientific, Technical, Executive, Clericaland Typing grades and, apart from certain exceptions, above the Minor andManipulative and the Industrial grades. Those below the line would be permitted greater liberty than those above it.   (Paragraphs 64-65.)4. The Service Departments&apos; Constabularies, although classified as minor and Manipulative grades, should be placed above the line. (Paragraph 59.)The majority of us consider that Post Office supervisory Minor andManipulative grades should also be above the line.   (Paragraphs 62-63.)5. All members of the grades &quot;below the line &quot; should be permitted to stand for Parliament without resignation unless they are elected, and onemonuYs special leave should be granted for the period of candidature. we also recommend that civil servants &quot; below the line &quot; who become Membersof Parliament should be entitled to reinstatement if they cease to be M.Ps.after an absence not exceeding five years and if they have had notless than ten years of service prior to their election ; in other cases applica-tions from civil servants &quot; below the line &quot; for permission to return shouldwherever possible be sympathetically considered.  (Paragraphs 56-57.)The existing ban upon Parliamentary candidature should continue to applyto civil servants &quot; above the line.&quot; (Paragraph 68.) The rule under whichcivil servants who are peers of Parliament may attend in their place when their official duties permit but may not vote or take part in debate shouldalso be maintained.  (Paragraph 69.)6. All grades of the Civil Service &quot; below the line &quot; should be completelyfree to engage in all other forms of political activity, both national andlocal, subject only to the maintenance of overriding considerations such asthe Official Secrets Acts and the ban on political activities while on duty or in official premises. (Paragraph 64.)7. All the grades &quot; above the line &quot; should continue to maintain a reserve in political matters. In national politics they should abstain from any public manifestation of their views which might associate them prominentlywith a political party. They should not (a) hold office in any party political organisation ; (b) speak in public on matters of party political con-troversy ; (c) write letters to the Press, publish books or articles, or circulateleaflets setting forth their views on party political matters; id) canvass insupport of political candidatures. (Paragraph 70.)8. In the sphere of public affairs which are not matters of party con-troversy, civil servants should be given more latitude to play their part inthe normal activities of citizenship, so long as they do so in an unofficialcapacity and observe the code of reserve. (Paragraphs 71-74.)9. We draw attention to the tendency apparent over a number of years for the delegates of certain staff associations at conferences to make speechesof a political nature inconsistent, in the case of serving civil servants, withthe existing rules of conduct. If our recommendations are adopted, no suchproblem will arise in the case of associations representing grades &quot; belowthe line.&quot; We consider that members of associations representing grades&quot; above the line&quot; may be trusted to pay regard to our general recommendations.   (Paragraphs 75-80.)
10. Despite the growing tendency of local government to be run on party political lines we are averse from treating it at present in the same way as national politics. We recommend the substitution of a general rule in place of varying departmental regulations. (Paragraphs 81-86.) Civilservants &quot; above the line &quot; wishing to stand for local office should seek the permission of their Department. (Paragraph 87.) Permission should be grantedwherever possible, subject to the applicant being able to comply with theconvention requiring a reserve in political matters and avoid becoming involvedin national party political controversy ; this does not, however, precludehim from speaking in public, writing to the press, or circulating leaflets setting forth his views, so long as he confines himself to local issues and acts withmoderation. (Paragraph 87.) Heads of Departments should consult together to secure greater uniformity in the exercise of their discretionary powers.(Paragraph 88.) They should also draw up a list of those Departments whosestaffs, either wholly or partially, must be excluded from taking part in localgovernment. (Paragraph 89.)11. The whole position in regard to participation in local governmentshould be reviewed in five years&apos; time. (Paragraph 91.)12. A statement of the rules governing political activity should be sentto every successful candidate when he is offered an appointment in the CivilService. (Paragraph 92.)13. The results of these recommendations, if accepted, would be asfollows:  (i) To increase from about 200,000 to about 666,000 (out of a totalof approximately 1,136,000) the number of civil servants having a rightto stand for Parliament without resignation unless elected;(ii) To give complete political freedom to the same number ;(iii) To maintain the existing limitations upon the rest of the CivilService, subject to variations in detail.We wish to express our appreciation of the many and most valuableservices rendered to us by our Secretary, Mr. F. C. Newton, of the Treasury.His familiarity with the earlier history of this subject and his capacity for handling large bodies of evidence have contributed in high degree to thesuccessful performance of our task..

Hankey.APPENDIX other POLITICAL ACTIVITIESEXAMPLES OF EXISTING DEPARTMENTAL RULESAPPLICABLE TO NON-INDUSTRIAL GRADESTreasury rule, adopted by Admiralty, Ministry of Food, Scottish Home Department,and certain other Departments: -&quot; Civil servants are expected to maintain at all times a reserve in political matters,and not put themselves forward prominently on one side or the. other.&quot;Ministry of Agriculture: &quot;It is a well-understood rule that civil servants should refrain from taking an overtpart in public political affairs.&quot;Board of Customs and Excise : &quot;In view of the nature of the work of the Department, the Board expect officersof all ranks to exercise a reserve in political: matters and not to engage in active participation, in the work qf any ppliticaj organisation.&quot;Foreign Office:-.&quot;No member of the Foreign. Service, may engage in any political activity, whichmight in any way conflict with the interests of the Service of be inconsistent: withhis position as a member of the Foreign Service.&quot;Ministry of Education :-&quot;It is a well-understood rule of the Service that civil,servants; should;refrain from,taking an active share in party politics, or engaging publicly in political,controversy.&quot;Ministry of; Health:-&quot; No member, of the staff may engage in any other occupation or undertaking whichmight in.any way conflict with the-interests of the Department or be inconsistent withhis position as a public servant.&quot;
104Home Office: &quot;Officers of the Department are required to act discreetly in all matters in which their conduct may become the subject of public criticism. They may not take a prominent part in party politics or in any public discussions with regard to the publicconduct of Ministers or the policy of the Government.&quot;Central Office of Information: &quot;An officer of the Ministry may not take a prominent party in party politics orin any public discussion with regard to the public conduct of Ministers or the policyof the Government.&quot;Board of Inland Revenue : -&quot; No serving officer of the Department ... may become a Parliamentary candi-date, nor may he publicly support the candidature of any person standing for election to Parliament. Officers stationed in the provinces are under a special obligationto abstain from taking an active part in public matters of a contentious character.&quot;Ministry of Labour and National Service: &quot; A civil servant is also expected to refrain from taking any prominent part in politics, and to maintain a proper reticence in discussing public affairs, particularly those with which his own Department is concerned.&quot;Post Office :-&quot;(a) Officers of the Post Office are eligible to be placed on the ParliamentaryRegister, and to vote at a Parliamentary Election. Nevertheless, it is expected of them as Public Servants that they will at all times maintain a certain reserve in political matters, and not put themselves forward on one side or the other. (For Sub-Postmasters only: &apos;This is especially the case with Sub-Postmasters, whose study itshould be to retain the confidence of their neighbours and carefully to avoid doing anything that may lend colour to the suggestion that in the discharge of their officialduties they are influenced by political or party motives.&apos;)(b) In pursuance of this general principle the following regulations have been laiddown:  (i) No officer shall serve on a Committee having for its object to promote orprevent the return of a particular candidate to Parliament or to promote the interests of a political party.(ii) No officer shall support or oppose any particular candidate or party atany time either by public speaking or writing.(iii) No notice soliciting votes for any particular candidate shall be exhibitedeither within or without any Post Office or other buildings under thecontrol of the Department; and within such buildings no memorial oraddress with a party object shall lie for signature or be exhibited.(iv) Any officer who observes that a mail cart has affixed to it a placardsoliciting votes for a particular candidate should report the fact withoutdelay.(v) No officer shall, when in uniform, take part in any demonstration of apolitical or party character.(c) These regulations are not regarded as necessarily precluding Post Office Servantsfrom undertaking canvassing work at Election times when they are not on duty andare not in uniform. It is, however, obvious that in the case of certain of the more responsible grades, active canvassing would be incompatible with their official posi-tion, and whilst the Postmaster General prefers to leave this question to the discretionand good sense of the staff, he must reserve to himself the right to specify certaingrades the members of which may be forbidden to undertake political canvassing.&quot;Ministry of Works : &quot;Officers of the Ministry are required to act discreetly in all matters in which their conduct may become the subject of public criticism. They may not take a prominentpart in party politics or in any public discussion with regard to the public conductof Ministers or the policy of the Government.&quot;War Office:-&quot; An official will not engage in any activity which would in any way tend to impairhis usefulness as a public servant or which might conflict with the interests of theDepartment or be inconsistent with his position as a public servant.&quot;The Air Ministry has an identical rule, and the regulation has also been adoptedby the Ministry of Supply.
&quot; A Handbook for the New Civil Servant&quot; issued by H.M. Treasury to all Depart-commitments , contains the following paragraph : &quot;. . . A civil servant must not take any open part in political controversy,even if he is not thinking of standing for Parliament. This does not mean thatyou may not have your private political opinions, that you may not vote at an election, or even that you may not belong to a political party; but it does mean that you must not do anything which might cause the general public, who do not know you, to doubt whether you can be an impartial servant. It makes no difference, of course, which political party you adhere to; the party which forms the Government to-day may be in opposition next year, or next week, and if your loyalty to the Government is not doubted now it may be doubted then.&quot;APPENDIX 6LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIESEXAMPLES OF EXISTING RULES APPLICABLE TO NON-INDUSTRIALGRADESGeneral&quot; It will rest with the Head of each Department to determine whether, and if so, uponv/hat conditions an officer of his Department may become a candidate for, or serve on,any Local Council, provided that the duties involved in such candidature or service shall not conflict with the personal performance of the officers duties to theDepartment.&quot;   (Treasury Circular of 15th November, 1909.)Admiralty&quot;The permission of the Board must be obtained if any officer serving under theAdmiralty wishes to stand as a candidate for membership of a County Council,municipal body, etc.&quot;Air Ministry&quot; (a) Civilians employed in Air Ministry establishments may not hold municipalappointments or parochial offices, or any public situation, except as stated in sub-paragraph (b).(b) They may become candidates for, or serve on, a,&quot;County Council, DistrictCouncil, Parish Council, Borough Council or an Education Committee. Withregard to these appointments the policy is to allow civilians reasonablefacilities for serving, even although the hours of meeting of Councils or committees may conflict with the working hours of the establishment; butthe Air Ministry reserve the right to require a civilian to retire from anysuch Council or Committee if it is found that his membership requires himto be absent from official duty during ordinary working hours and that this involves serious inconvenience to the public service.&quot;Central Office of Information&quot; 1.

They are not allowed to becomecandidates for other Councils or accept municipal office except with the consent of thePermanent Secretary.&quot;Post Office&quot; An officer of the Department may become a candidate for, or serve on, any County,Municipal or Local Council provided that the duties involved in such candidature or service do not conflict with his duties in the Department.

Such leavemay be taken in half days.&quot;(b) Civilian staff at War Department Outstations:&quot; Employees may serve on a local council on the understanding that member-ship of such public body does not interfere with the efficient performance oftheir duties as employees of the War Department, and that the usual times of meetings do not conflict with working hours. If, however, a meeting has tobe held during official hours, leave may be specially granted, provided thatthe work of the establishment will not suffer through the absence of the employee concerned. . . . Employees may not hold municipal or parochialappointments or any similar offices without War Office sanction.&quot;
