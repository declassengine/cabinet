(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROx3ERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET^| C.P.Qj.9) 135. COPY NO .3.118TH JUNE, 1949CABINETHONG KONG - POINTS RAISED BY THEUNITED STATES GOVERNMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies1. In accordance with the conclusions of the meetingof the Cabinet on Thursday, 26th May (CM. (49) 33th Conclusions,Minute 3)  an Approach was made to the United States Governmentto inform them of the development of the situation in HongKong and of the decision to reinforce the Garrison stillfurther, and to ascertain whether they &quot;would be prepared tosupport a policy of defending Hong Kong against aggressionby Communist forces from the mainland, and, if need be, tomake, at the appropriate stage, public declarations in supportof that policy.&apos;&apos;2. Mr. Acheson has now put forward to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment a number of points about Hong Kong.   He asks howwe would propose to act if the Communists used all measuresshort of arraed attack to secure the retrocession of Hong Kong;I I what would be the extent and possible duration of the protectivemeasures &apos; which might be necessary on our partj   and how farBritish economic interests in Kong Kong would be willing toplay their part.   The State Department also wish to know whatwe hope might come from an appeal to the United Nations,particularly in view of the fact that the Chinese Communistsare not represented there and are not even an establishedGovernment.    (See Annex I - telegram from Foreign Secretary).3  It will be recalled that, in the course of thenegotiations preceding the conclusion in 1943 of a treatyabolishing extra-torritoriality in China, the Chinese Govern-ment made a request for the rendition of the New Territories.His Majesty&apos;s Government, while refusing to consider thisrequest in connection with extra-territoriality, intimatedI that, if the Chinese Government desired that the questionof the lease of these Territories should be reconsidered,that was a matter v/hich, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, should be discussed when victory was won. TheChinese Governraent thereupon reserved their right to raisethe question later.4  In the summer of 1946 Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shekreferred informally to the desirability of finding an earlys lution of &quot;the Hong Kong problem11 and, in succeeding months,consideration was given at the official level to the lineson which negotiations with the Chinese might be pursued shouldthe matter go to that length.   One of the plans which wasI considered contemplated the possible rendition of the greater Ipart of the New Territories, but with conditions as to thecontrol of public utilities there (e.g. water supplies and air ^^flI fields), which would preserve the viability of the Island and II Kowloon, which would remain British.   In the event, however, II the Chinese Government, did not revert to the matter, and no^^MmQ further consideration v/as given to it.-1-
19 I 113315  Since then important changes have occurred.   At theIJ time when negotiations were contemplated it was hoped thatthere would be a stable and friendly Government in China,which would play an effective part in the deliberations of theUnited Nations.   Now, insofar as a stable Government of Chinimay emerge, it seems certain that it will be Communist, orCommunist-controlled, and sympathetic to Soviet Russia ratherthan to ourselves,   in such circumstances, I feel that it isH^l&apos; no longer practicable to consider the New Territories apartfrom the rest of the Colony,   To conclude any arrangement withI a Communist Government on any such basis as that mentionedabove would inevitably place the Colony in an increasinglyprecarious position, shorn of defence in depth and withoutany real assurance that conditions which, would be essentialto such an arrangement would be faithfully observed.6. The now situation, therefore calls for re-examination:-(a)   It is desirable that any line taken should beacceptable to India, Australia, New Zealand and other membersof the Commonwealth.^^fl (b)   The United States Government are not likely&apos; to viewwith favour any uncompromising statement regarding our futureI possession of Hong Kong.   They may stand with us againstU aggression, but their public is unlikely to discard the viewthat Britain should remain in China only with the agreementof the Chinese Government.j (-o)   We may well be faced with a request from aComraunist Government of China to enter into negotiationsi about Hong Kong.   This is a matter which will require most^^fl 1 careful consideration, and my colleagues will no doubt agreew that we should embark upon it without further delay.(d) Since in any event the lease of the New Territoriesexpires in l S years and the life of Hong Kong, e.g. its watersupplies, airport facilities, etc., depends in no small part1 I f/ on those Territories, it is the more necessary that we should^^fl [l  review our policy for the future of the Colony.(e) Any public reference now to the possibility of future^^fl 11                 negotiations, or any hint which might leak out that such av4 possibility is being considered, would have the most damagingeffect on morale in Hong Kong at a time when we are endeavouring,.by the despatch of reinforcements and in other ways, tostrengthen and maintain morale in support of our policy ofresistance to Communist aggression*7  I have consulted the Governor of Hong Kong aboutI points raised in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;stelegram (Annex I), and I annex a copy of his reply (Annex II).He points out that civil disturbances in Hong Kong would havea prejudicial effect even on that part, of its trade (now &amp;0%)which is conducted with countrie-s other than China. Nevertheless,the Governor considers that,  in the circumstances envisagedby Mr. Acheson, it will be possible to hold the position^^fl in Hong Kong indefinitely]   and that upon the lifting of theblockade and boycott, and the cessation of internal unrest,I the economic recovery of the Colony would probably be rapid.H # I
Hi - I8. Having regard to the necessity of sending anearly reply to Mr* Acheson&apos;s enquiries, and to the risk ofleakage from the State Department, or from one of the otherCommonwealth. Governments, who, no doubt, will have to be madeaware of our correspondence with the Americans, I suggestthat the reply to Mr* Acheson should take the following lines-^^HM ^ (a)   No positive :!assurance:? was given to the Chinese ^^flGovernment in 19^2.   But in 19^3 they were informed that, ifthey desired that the lease .of the New Territories should bereconsidered,  :ithat mm a matter which, in the opinion of His1    Majesty1 s Government, should be discussed when victory was^^^M won.;r   The Chinese Government thereupon reserved their rightto raise the question later.   This indication of the willing-ness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to discuss these matters afterthe war presupposed the existence in China of a stable, unified,democratic and friendly Government*   These conditions do not^^^H now exist, and it is impossible to forecast when they arelikely to arise*   But it is assumed that it will be some time^^^1 before a Government of china emerges with which we could^^^H contemplate discussing the future of Hong Kong, or even of the^^^M New Territories*   Above all, we should certainly not be^^^H prepared to discuss these matters under a threat of duress*(b)   Nevertheless, we recognise that we are likely to befaced with a request from a Comi&apos;aunist Government of China^^^fl to enter into negotiations about Hong Kong before these con-^^^M i ditions are established*   We are now considering what our^^^| I/ fbfiftiS&apos;--* I attitude should be to sueh a request*^^^M (c)   If the Chinese Communists should try to force our^^^fl hands by fomenting internal -unrest and/or by applying an^^^M economic boycott or blockade, it is our intention to maintain^^^M order, the essential public services and the economic life^^^H of the Colony*   In this connection, it is to be noted thatover 80^0 of the trade of Hong Kong is now with countries other(d) Even allowing for the fact that, in the conditions^^^M envisaged, it would be necessary to rely on seaborne imports ^^fl^^^H to feed the population of Hong Kong, we see no reason to^^^M doubt our capacity to maintain these conditions for as long^^^H as may be necessary*(e) (The reply to the State Department&apos;s questionas to what we hope might come from an appeal to the United^^^M Nations is a matter which. I understand, is under considerationby the Foreign Secretary.):V-It will be observed that this* dees not include a reply to*-vvw*. *u,**   Mr* Acheson&apos;s enquiry as to the attitude of the British economic^^^J interests in the circumstances which he envisages******  9# In View 0f        terras of paragraph 5 of the Governor&apos;stelegram, my colleagues will, no doubt, agree that it will be .better to avoid giving an explicit answer in any written^^^H communication to the State Department* ^^fl^^^J Colonial Office, S*V;/*1&gt;,^^Hl I       , 1 18th June, 194-9*IE   ~3~ ^fl?

HI I 135 IANNEX II TELEGRAM TO FOREIGN OFFICE FROM FORE I ST\m SECRETARY^^^M (prom Council of Foreign Ministers, Paris(United Kingdom Delegation))^^Hl No* 113 ^|Sth June, 19U9Repeated to WashingtonAt Mr. Acheson&apos;s suggestion I. arranged for Mr, Barclay^^^H to call on him this morning to hear some points which the^^^H State Department wished to put to us about Hong Kong.2. Mr. Acheson said that in the view^ of the UnitedStates Government it was unlikely that the Chinese Communistswould launch a full-scale military attack on Hong Kong.(If they did, the position would he clear ani the United Stateswould certainly back us in every way they could.   What seemed^^^^ much more likely however, was that the Communists wouldin due course demand the retrocession of Hong Kong or at anyrate the surrender of the new territories.   If we refuse,they would probably apply an economic boycott or blockade and^^^H create the greatest possible amount of disturbance byinfiltration.   Mr. Acheson mentioned that the State Depart-^^^H LI rnent view was that the Communist authorities would back their^^^fl demands by quoting the assurance given to thelChinese Govern-^^^fl ment in 19U-2 that His Majesty1 s Government woSLd be ready^^^1(1 after the war to discuss- the terms of the leasts of the newterritories.3  In the circumstances, the United States Governmentwere anxious to know how we would propose to act ix1 the-Communists used all measures short of armed attack, whatwould.be the extent and the possible duration of the protectivemeasures which might be necessary on our part aid how farwould British economic interests in Hong Kong be willing to^^^Hl play their part?^^^fl i+t The State Department also wished to know what we^^?1 : hoped might conje from an appeal to the United Nations,particularly in view of the fact that the Chinese Communistsare not represented there and are not even an established^^^H government.H Mr. Acheson said it would helv&gt; to clarify American- Hth;m]d~ng on this whole problem if we could give him some sort^^^H of (anser) to these questions.^?1 ?
II I- 136 II ANNEX IITELEGRAM FROM GOVERNOR,  HONG KONG,TO THE SECRETARY OF &quot;STATE FOR THE COLONIES^H)     l^th June, 19^9-Repeated to Commissioner General.Your telegram No* 707*If the Communists were to institute blockade andboycott and instigate internal unrest (it is possible thatIblockade or boycott might be instituted without concurrentprovoking of internal unrest) I consider that with garrisonstrengthened by reinforcements that are coming we could holdour position here indefinitely*12* Emergency Regulations would be introduced and suchaction as seemed necessary v/ould be taken under them*   They fl^|v/ould include such things as mobilisation of Defence Forceand Special Constabulary closing the border controlling cityapproaches strict immigration control registration rationingessential food and fuel supplies etc*   In the likely event ofunemployment developing with rise in food prices it would benecessary to distribute food at subsidised prices in order H^lto keep the population quiet*   This v/ould necessitate importingpossibly from without adequate supplies of meat, flour tinnedvegetables and other essentials* 3H3  It is impossible to forecast how long this state fl^lof affairs would last as it v/ould depend on how long communistswould be prepared to keep it up.    It would have progressively^^fl serious effect on the economy of the Colony as we should loseall our trade with china during the Emergency whilst trade BHwith other parts of the world would also fall off as merchantsv/ould be reluctant to send their cargoes to a port where there&apos;was civil disturbance*   Another probable result of theblockade and boycott would be that many Chinese would leave |H^^fl the Colony v/hilst trouble lasted though it is possiblethat Comraunists might refuse to allow Chinese who wish toleave the Colony or whom we wished to push out to enter China*If many Chinese could leave would be a good thing*   Upon liftingof the blockade and boycott and cessation of internal unresteconomic recovery would probably be rapid*i . Counter blockade by us or China might inconveniencethe Communists who would have to look elsewhere for goocfe they |^|would normally import from here in particular oil.   But suchcounter measures would be unavailing if (?unless intended)the U*S* Governraent and others with oil joined in denyingcommodities concerned to the Chinese Communists*5* I anticipate that British firms would be willing toAj   pl^y their part at first but if the Communists link boycott of11  Hong Kong with action against British firms in China it is II |I  likely that some of the firms would press for a compromiseI  J   settlement with the Comraunists*H) # -5- I
