(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.CU9)  120 COPY No2j23RD MAY, 19k9CABINETHONG Kong memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 9th May (c.M.(49) 33r&apos;d Conclusions, Minute 2(5))the Cabinet asked me to circulate a factual appreciation of thepresent situation in Hong Kong for the information of mycolleagues c2.     Facts about Hong Kong(i)      The Colony consists of (a) the island of Kong Kong(approximately 32 square miles),  (b) part of the KowloonPeninsula (approximately 3 square miles) and (c) the NewTerritories (approximately 359  scuaro ; tiles).   A map is annexed,(a)by China for 99 years in lo9cr  to meet the Colony&apos;s defence needs.The length of the land frontier is 12 miles;    that ofthe sea frontier is approximately 200 miles.(ii)     PopulationThe estimated total population of Hong Kong is1,800,000.    The non-Chinese elements are as follows:-British subjects (United Kingdom andother Coinmonwealth countries)  ................ 6,500British subjects of Portuguese race ............. 3?000United States nationals *......................... 250Dutch and Scandinavian........................ 200French...............................-.......... 100Other non-Asiatics .. *........................... 500Indians....................................... 2,000Fi1ippinos .... ................................. * 200Stateless....................................... 200Total  ... 12,950(iii)     When ceded to us Hong Kong was a barren rocksBritish enterprise bias turned it into one of the most important and thriving ports and Markets of the world.    Even whenconditions in China were at their best,  it was a comparativehaven.of settled lav/ and order where traders (not least among them the Chinese) could conduct their business and thrive asnowhere else in China,  except in the treaty ports (especially,of coarse, Shanghai).    This trade has been of great benefit notonly to Europe and America, but also to China and to othercountries of the Far East.    The only stable basis for inter-national trade in the Far East has always been sterling.    Thex Treaty of Nanking 18*4.2.s Peking Convention i860./     Peking Convention 1898.-1

Hong Kong dollar1 circulates not only in the Colony hut also overgreat areas in South China, to the great advantage not only oftraders but of the general population in that area.   Even beforethe Cor,anunist advance, inept administration- in Shanghai had ledto the beginning of a flight of industry to Hong Kong, and toa serious decline in shipping business.(iv)      Hong Kong TradeEvery month Hong Kong handles about  20,000,000worth of goods,  of which it consumes or produces less than threeper cent.    In other words, Hong Kong&apos;s business is bringing in other people&apos;s goods and sending them out again.    It providesstorage, insurance, banking and shipping facilities for thistransit trade,  and the Colony has no other major economic role.The total value of capital invested in Hong Kong isprobably of the order of  250,000,000.    Perhaps one quarter ofthis was invested by persons resident,  and companies registered,in the United Kingdom.    The remaining three-quarters representslocal investments.    Of this a half is probably non-Chinese(mainly British)  capital,  and. the remainder Chinese.    The total amount of British capital invested in Hong Kong may thereforebe of the order of  156,000,000.For the purposes of comparison it may perhaps besaid that British investment in Shanghai is of the order of 250,000,000.(v)     British Interests in China in relation to Hong KongBritish interests in China fall into two classes:-(a) Import-export firms,  distributing firms, banking,insurance, agency and shipping firms.    As far asit is possible to generalise it may be said that up to 90$ of the total business of these firms is directly or indirectly dependent upon Hong Kong;(b) Industrial, utility and. social enterprises inChina (e.g. cotton, mining, public utilities,hotels,  hospitals,  schools) to which Hong Kongis of negligible importance except as indicatedin the succeeding paragraph.    This second categoryprobably represents the greater part of british property in China.A number of companies operating entirely in Chinaare registered in Hong Kong under Hong Kong lav/ as &quot;Chinacompanies&quot;.    This enables them to maintain their capital in hong Kong dollars.    Communist action to compel registration in China in a currency with little or no practioal value would presumably wipe out a large part of the value of the shares of those companies, which at present is probably sane millions of pounds.    Even companies with little interest in Hong Kongunder (b) of the previous paragraph, have a considerable interest in Hong Kong from this aspect.(vi)     Shipping and IndustriesHong Kong lies roughly midway on the 2,500 mile runfrom Singapore to Japan.    It is one of the finest natural harboursin the world and has been developed, as a free port and littleelse.    Its industries are ship-repair and ship-building (up to10,000 gross registered tons) and. its services include registry,insurance,  agency, bunkering, banking etc.    About 200,000 g.r.t.of British shipping is based on Hong Kong.

In 1921. at the peak of its prosperity, entrances andclearances were k3^ million g.r.t., and by 19k8 these hadrecovered to 22 million g.r.t.In addition there have been important recent developments in light manufacturing industries, the products of which are being exported in considerable quantities tothe United Kingdom.(vii)     Water supplies the Colony&apos;s water supply is derived SOji fromreservoirs on the island and k-Qfyo from the New Territories bypipeline under the harbour.   Kowloon is wholly supplied fromthe New Territories.   The present supply is insufficient for theincreased population, and hours of supply have to be limitedduring the dry months.   The possibility of increasing-reservoir capacity on the island has been examined, but anysoheme would be expensive and inadequate.   A project in theNew Territories to provide approximately 30,000,000 gallons per day at a cost of approximately  k,000,000, which is consideredthe only practicable_scheme, is now under consideration.(See also paragraph 3(h) below.)3.     Development projectsWe have on hand certain major development projects,for which the continued retention of the New Territories is ofparticular importance.   These include:-(a) The projected modern airport near Deep Bay in theNew Territories, for which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas promised an interest-free loan up to  3*000,000](b) The proposed extension of the water supply catchmentareas in the New Territories to supplement existingsupplies, already inadequate, for Hong Kong island and Kowloon;(c) Projects for the development of agriculture and fishing at an approximate cost of  500,000 from theColonial Development and Welfare Vote;(d) The future replanning of the cities of Victoria onHong Kong island and of Kowloon on the basis of areport prepared by Sir Patriok Aborerouble with assistance from the Colonial Development and welfare Vote;(e) The rehabilitation of the Hong Kong University isin progress.   The Hong Kong Government are makinga grant of  250,000 towards this and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has promised a similar amount.   the precise use to which these grants are to be put isstill under discussion.k.     Attitude of Chinese Government towards Ho^g, KongThe population of china generally know/s little of hong Kong, but there is a strong irredentist sentiment among theeducated, and. semi-educated with a handy rallying cry forrendition which has an obvious mob-appeal.   No ChineseGovernment,  therefore,  can afford to be other than basically anti-British over Hong Kong, and there is no reason to suppose that a communist Government of China will be less so than any other, andgood reason to think that its particular ideology and inter-national affiliations may make it more so.   We must expectsooner or later increased rather than decreased Chinese pressure for the rendition of Hong Kong.

5*     Position of Communists in Hong KongHong Kong, &quot;being geographically and racially a partof China, has no politics of its own but reflects the politicsof China,   Immigrants from China far outnumber the Hong KongChinese, who themselves have an eye over their shoulder onChina.   Hong Kong provides a home of refuge for any party inChina out of power, and, in accordance with Hong Kong&apos;stradition of neutrality and non-interference in the politicalaffairs of China, supporters of the Kuomintang regime and ofthe Comraunists have alike been allowed to reside in Hong Kong-provided they obey the law and do not behave so as to damagerelations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governmentof China.   With the retirement of Chiang Kai-shek: and the defeat of the National Forces in North China, Kuomintang influence in Hong Kong, has greatly declined..   More important, Communistsinside Hong Kong have left for China, and Communists in Hong-Kong have so far shown little signs of attacking theadministration.It has,  however, now been reported that an attempt is being made to unify the command, of the communist irregularforces in South China and to establish a liaison office in hong Kong.   Hong Kong Communists have received a ChineseCommimist Party Directive to mobilise peasants,  intellectuals,overseas-Chinese businessmen, etc., for the purpose of supporting the southward drive by the main Conmiunist forces.6.     Action in Hong Kong in anticipation, of the emergency(i)     Pood SuppliesThese are at present adequate.   A stock of rice,estimated at six months&apos;  supply, is held, and the Colonyhas been stock-piling certain commodities which might runshort in an emergency.(ii)     Police force the Police Force in Hong Kong has recently been greatly expanded, and its strength is now double that of 1941*(iii)     Possible refugee influxMeasures have already been concerted to close theland frontier of Hong Kong with military assistance to prevent a serious influx of refugees.    The necessary material (barbed wire, pickets, etc.) is available locally.   Measures are alsoin hand to establish, with the assistance of the naval authorities,  coastal patrols by sea and land to prevent, asfar as possible, any influx across the sea -frontier.(iv)     Measures against subversive activitiesThe Government has also taken power to enable it tocontrol more effectively subversive activities.    It has notonly enacted the Illegal Strikes Ordinance, but has takenpowers which have enabled it to close Communist controlledschools such as the Tak Tak College.    In connection withoutspoken attacks on British and American policy in Communist-controlled newspapers in Hong Kong,  the Governor has recentlysought guidance on the question of closing these organs downin the last resort, thoup;h he appreciates that this could notbe done if it were to conflict with His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;general policy or embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in any negotiations.   This matter is still under consideration.

With, the concurrence of the Foreign Office theGovernor has been authorised, to enact legislation to provide forthe compulsory registration of all local societies, under whichall Triad Societies and all local branches of foreignpolitical parties would become unlawful.   The Governor regardsthis as an essential measure, not only to forestall a demand forthe establishment by the Chinese Communist Party of an office in hong Kong, but also to control the infiltration, underrespectable disguises,  of Communists.   There is no intentionof suppressing political activity for the benefit of theColony, but only political activity which has no relation tothe Colony and merely projects external troubles and quarrelsinto the life of Hong Kong.   The proposed legislation wouldbe non-discriminatory.   Parties immediately affected would bethe Kuomintang,  the China Democratic League and the K.M.T.Revolutionary Committee, together with a number of smallerChinese political parties.    (The Communist Party has nobranch in Hong Kong, though the majority of the public utilityand waterfront labour unions are under Conxaunist influence).Similar legislation is already in operation in Singapore andwill shortly be enacted in the Federation of Malaya.7.     Attitude of the local populationMy colleagues are aware of the representations which were made to me by the Governor of Hong Kong and theCommissioner-General, South East Asia, supported by a Signalfrom the Commanders-in-Chief, Singapore, before the debate on 5th May as to the serious effect on the morale of thepopulation of Hong Kong, both British and Chinese (andespecially the latter, on whose attitude to us we are sovitally dependent), if we did not make it abundantly clear thatwe are determined to maintain our position in Hong Kong.   Ina despatch which reached me after that debate, the G-overnorinformed me that speculation on the part of the highlyintelligent and critical public opinion in the Colony hascentred not so much on what has been said in the variousstatements which have been made in the course of the past fewmonths, as on the significance of what appears to have beenpurposely left unsaid.   The plain fact is that,  so long as thereis airy doubt in the minds of the Chinese population of our determination to maintain our position in the Colony, or, inother words, so long as there is a fear that Britain may ultimately abandon Hong Kong,  they will not commit themselvesto wholehearted co-operation with us in the defence of theColony.    The future risks to themselves would be too greatto permit them to do so.The Governor has also reported, that, for reasons of this kind, of a total population of nearly 2 millions,probably not more than 10,000 persons, including the police force and. the permanent Government service, would prove willingto   commit themselves by giving the Government their active andwholehearted support in the preservation of internal order and the operation of the minimum essential services, upon whichall   else depends.A.C.J.Colonial Office, S.W.I.,23rd May, 1949.
