THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1949Copy No.CABINETDESPATCH OF CABINET AND CABINET COMMITTEE business during THE SUMMER HOLIDAYNote by the Prime minister propose that during the six weeks from 1st August to 10th Septembermeetings of the Cabinet and its Standing Ministerial Committees should bereduced to the minimum.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to consider forthwith: whether there are any matters on which they will have to obtain decisions from the Cabinet orfrom a Cabinet Committee before the middle of September, and to make everyeffort to bring these matters forward for consideration by the end of July.3. Problems relating to our balance of payments will doubtless need to beconsidered by Ministers collectively during this period, and meetings of theEconomic Policy Committee may have to be held for this purpose. I propose,however, that other urgent business which would ordinarily have been handled by a Cabinet Committee should be dealt with in this period by the Cabinet itselfif it should be meeting for other purposes. If any such business should ariseduring&apos;the period 1st August to 10th September, the Minister concerned should communicate with the Cabinet Secretariat, who will advise how it can best be handled.4. I am making arrangements to ensure that a nucleus of Ministers willbe available for any meetings of the Cabinet or Economic Policy Committee whichmay have to be held.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,7th July, 1949.SECRETCP. (49) 1467th July, 19493724-1
