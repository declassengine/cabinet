THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1949Copy No.CABINETABBREVIATIONSNote by the Prime minister the increasing use of initials for example, I.E.P.S. for the intra-european payments scheme and similar abbreviations for example, ECOSOC for economic and Social Council imposes an unnecessary strain upon busy Ministers,who cannot be expected to be familiar with all these abbreviations.If it is necessary that such abbreviations should be used in papers circulatedto the Cabinet or its Ministerial Committees, the full title should always begiven on the first mention, with the abbreviated version following in brackets.Thus, if the first mention takes the form : &apos;&apos; the intra-European payments scheme(I.E.P.S.) . . . .,&quot; it is permissible that, if necessary in the interests of brevity,subsequent references should be to &quot; I.E.P.S.&quot;I recognise that some inconvenience might be caused if this rule were applieduniversally to all official documents. These abbreviations are doubtless a usefulform of shorthand for officials immersed in the technicalities of a particularsubject. But, even those officials should remember that some of their documents telegrams, in. particular are circulated for information to a wider circle whichwill include Ministers and others who are less familiar with these technicalities.All responsible for drafting such documents should therefore keep this pointin mind, and should be sparing in their use of these abbreviations in contextswhere their meaning is not obviously apparent.I should be glad if Ministers would give instructions accordingly.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,ldth July, 1949.confidential cp. (49) 150ISth July, 194937262
