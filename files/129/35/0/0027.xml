(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by trie President off the Board of trade at their meeting on 30th May (CM. (49) 39thConclusions, Minute 3) tho Cabinet approved the proposals outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (49) 124 asto the line he should take at the meeting in Paris of the consultative Ministerial Group on the subject of intra-Europeantrade and payments.   My colleagues will know that the consultative Ministerial Group endorsed the chancellor&apos;s call for liberalisation of intra-European trade, and approved forconsideration by the Council of O.E.Pu.C a statement&apos;setting-out the principles on which participating countries should beinvited to proceed.   This statement, of which I attach a copy(Annex A) is due , to be published on 20th June.2. The publication of this statement is likely to exciteinterest in industry and the Press.   Following the discussion at the Economic Policy Committee (E.P.C.(49) 21st Meeting,Minute 4) the Secretary for Overseas Trade explained theposition confidentially to the Consultative Committee for industry, on which both sides of industry are represented!   butI feel that a public explanation is needed to inform the country generally, and I propose, if my colleagues see no objection,to make one in the House in the form of a Written Answer to aQuestion.    (By giving a written answer we can hope to avoidSupplementary Questions on the subject of powers to maketariff adjustments, which the Consultative Committee for industry rather surprisingly did not raise.)3. I hope that my colleagues will approve, for notonly is the Paris statement one on which the House might properl;expect the Government to make a spontaneous announcement, butI feel that we should appropriately take some credit for this important initiative that we have taken in O.E.E.C., where,as my colleagues will be aware,  there has been some tendency to accuse us,  quite unjustifiably, of dragging our feet.4* I feel that it is important to make clear in this announcement that our ability to liberalise our importpolicy in the sense proposed must depend on our resolvingsatisfactorily the problem arising from our obligations underthe non-discrimination, clauses of our financial agreements withthe United States and Canada.    It is far from certain thatthe United States Administration, with whom we are nowdiscussing this problem, will be able to find a satisfactory way to overcome it.   In that event, we should be obligedto mark time in our import policy, and we should find it moredifficult to explain this if we had missed the opportunityS E C R E TCP.

at the outset to draw attention to this problem.   Further,if we &apos; did not make a reservation on this point in ourannouncement, the United States authorities would be quick todraw the moral that we are not serious in maintaining that asolution of the non-discrimination problem is essential if weare to go ahead with our import relaxations, and our chances of getting a solution would thus bo prejudiced.   On the otherhand, we do not wish to spot-light the problem in such a way as to invite public discussion which might prejudice theconsideration now being given to it in Washington and Ottawa.I have thought it wise,  therefore, to arrange for the UnitedStates and Canadian authorities to be consulted as to the formin which this point could, in their opinion, be bestpresented.5. Subject to the results of this consultation,I propose to give a Written Answer to a Question nextWednesday in the terms of the attached draft (Annex B) andI seek my colleagues&apos; concurrence.H.W.Board of Trade, 3.W.I.,18th June, 1949.

ANNEX &apos;A*TEXT OF RESOLUTION BY- MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIVEGROUP OF O.S.S.C.. 4th JV^^ivhv &apos;   &apos;The Chairman of the Council, on the advice of the consultative Group of Ministers, considering Article 4 of theConvention for European Economic Co-operation, dated ifeth April,19ho, considering paragraph 322 of the interim report on theEuropean Recovery Programme, considering Principle IV of theplan of action for 1949/50 approved By the Council on the2bth March, 1949, proposes:1.     That participating countries shall forthwith takethe necessary steps for the iprogressive elimination of quantitative import restrictions between one another, in orderto achieve as complete a liberalisation of Intra-Europeantrade as.possible by 1951.2.     That, for this purpose, they shall be invited to abolish such restrictions unilaterally as fully as their economic and financial position would permit.Note: These arrangements are without prejudice to the rightof participating countries to extend to non-participating countries, if they so wish,  the measures of relaxation thatthey are prepared to take.  &apos;3*     That participating countries shall report to theOrganisation for European. Economic Co-operation not later thanthe 1st October, 1949, on the measures which they have adoptedunilaterally and on those which they intend to adopt beforethe end of the year and subsequently.    The Organisation will- examine whether each country is making a contribution to the desired&apos;objective appropriate to its economic position.   Atthis examination account will be taken of all domesticarrangements likely to restrict the capacity of privateimporters to obtain the freed goods.4*     That,  should all or some of the participating countriesagree on a list or lists of products which have been or areto Be freed, they might agree that these should be consolidated-for. a definite period.5.     That, in making such agreements, the participating countries shall take full account of the provisions of other international agreements, especially the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Havana Charter, once this hasbeen ratified.6.      That, until quotas are completely abolished,  .creditor&apos; countries should, as far as possible, relax theirremaining quantitative restrictions in cases where such,relaxation should be o&apos;f particular importance to debtorcountries.7.     If in any case the internal economic or financialpolicies of a participating country are inhibiting action forthe liberalisation of trade as undertaken -under paragraph!above,  then representations can be made to O.E.E.C. and discussions thereon shall take place between the parties concerned.

8.     Those proposals are made on the assumptionthat suitable arrangements will be made in the field ofintra-Suropean payments,9.     It is desirable that corresponding action should so far as possible be taken in the field of tourism andother services.

ANNEX  &apos;BTIMPORT LICENSING ^^V7^NX-*DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND ANSWERQ* To ask. the President of the Board of Trade whether he will make a statement as to the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the matter of liberalising intra-European trade.A* Yes, Sir.   His Majesty*s Government have, during recent months, been considering the possibility of asubstantial step forward in the liberalisation of inter-national trade through a concerted effort by CE.E.Ccountries to relax their quantitative import restrictions.Such restrictions were instituted as a means of safeguarding the^balance of payments and not as a means of affordingadditional protection to producers.    If they are continued theyare liable to operate in a purely protective manner andso to the disadvantage of consumers.   His Majesty&apos;s government accordinly believe that it should be possible for both theUnited Kingdom and other countries to take steps to relaxprogressively their restrictions on imports from sources outsidethe hard-currency area to the fullest extent consistent withsafeguarding their balance of paymentsj    such steps wouldconsiderably expand, the volume of trade between such countries to the benefit of consumers and exporting industries in allthe countries.   V/e should&apos;wish to make such relaxations of ourcontrols in the United Kingdom apply to imports from all countries with whom our balance of payments and commercial arrangementsrender this possibles  including in particular the countries of Western Europe and of the sterling area..  The matter is oneof especial importance in relation to trade between thecountries of Western Europe, which have inevitably been compelled to introduce particularly rigorous import controls.My right honourable Priend the Chancellor of the Exchequertherefore submitted proposals for thus liberalising trade tothe Ministerial Consultative Group of O.E.E.C. and these arenow being placed before the O.E.E.G, itself.2. I should make it clear that certain other matterswould have to bo dealt with simultaneously with any startupon the relaxation of United Kingdom import controls.Pirst.    Our payments arrangements with other countries,and &quot;in particular the future system of intra-European paymentsnow under discussion in O.E.E.C., must be such as to avoid any increased disbursements of gold and dollars by the UnitedKingdom.Second.    It would clearly be quite unjustifiable andimpossible for us to discriminate against imports from countries outside the O.E.E.C., and. particularly other commonwealth countries in the sterling area, by withholdingthese import relaxations from them when this is not justified by balance of payments considerations.    This raises certaindifficult questions on our international obligations withregard to non-discrimination, which are at present underdiscussion with other Governments concerned.

Third. &quot; Flow far we can go must depend on the extent towhich other countries feel, able to follow our lead and relaxrestrictions on their imports from us within such limits as their balance of payments may sot.3. In deciding upon the list of goods that can be freely imported, we shall have to bear in mind the existencein certain cases, owing to severe raw material shortages.orto the need to put exports first,  of severe limitations onthe quantities of goods which certain of our industries orefree to put on the home market.    It would obviously beinqeuitable to permit producers in other countries to sellwithout restriction in the United Kingdom market so long-as United Kingdom producers ore subject to severe limitations of this kind;    and in such cases we could relax import controlonly as and when the restrictions on our own producers couldbe relaxed.4:. It is not possible at this stage- to say precisely what action may result from our initiative or how far it may go, but I thought the House would wish to be informed atthis stage of the steps that we have taken.
