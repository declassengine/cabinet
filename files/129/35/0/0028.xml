THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT 151Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1949SECRET Copy No.   31^  $ C.P. (49) 138I 21.S-; June, 1949CABINETSECURITY OF ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL INFORMATIONABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOMNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of DefenceThe Joint Intelligence Committee recently drew attention to the dangersinvolved in the disclosure of economic and industrial information about the UnitedKingdom which might be of military value to a potential enemy; and their^^fl proposals for controlling the publication of such information were endorsed bythe Chiefs of Staff.We thought it advisable to arrange for these proposals to be examined in thefirst instance by a working party of officials representing all the Departmentsconcerned. The working party has now made a report which we circulateherewith for the consideration of our colleagues. We are in agreement with therecommendations made in it.21st June, 1949.
SECURITY OF ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL INFORMATIONABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM I^^^^H Report by Official Working Party^^^^H We were asked to consider in detail the implications of the proposals in the^^^H Joint Intelligence Committee&apos;s report of 27th November, 1948 (J.I.C. (48) 122), A^^^^H for controlling the publication of economic and industrial information about the T^^^^H United Kingdom, and to seek to secure the greatest measure of agreement between^^^^b the Departments concerned on the general lines of future policy in this matter.^^^^H 2.   The Working Party included representatives of the Central Economic^^^H Planning Staff and Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Defence (including the \^^^H Joint Intelligence Bureau), Scottish Office, Ministry of Health, Board of Trade,^^^^M Admiralty, and the Ministries of Transport, Town and Country Planning, Supplyand Fuel and Power.  Representatives of the Security Service and of the War^^^H Office and Air Ministry attended for the discussion of specific aspects, of the^^^H 3.   In their report, the Joint Intelligence Committee drew attention to the^^^H value of economic intelligence to a potential enemy, and to the intensive efforts^^^^M made by the Soviet and Satellite Governments to obtain economic and industrial^^^H information about this country.  While they recognised that it was impracticable^^^H in peace-time to prevent the publication of all the strategic information which^^^H v?ould enable an enemy to assess our general economic readiness and potential for^^^H war, they nevertheless thought that something might be done to safeguard our^^^H position by further scrutiny of Government-sponsored publications, and in^^^H particular by safeguarding information about strategic stocks.   In the field of^^^H operational information, the Committee recommended that an appeal should be^^^H made to certain firms and public authorities of the highest importance to our war ^^fl^^^H potential fo safeguard information which might be of special value to a potential ^^fl^^^H We submit our recommendations under the two main heads of strategic and^^^H operational intelligence.^^^H {Strategic Intelligence^^^H 4.   A note on the principal classes of published economic statistics is^^^^M attached as Annex I to this paper.  The position, and our recommendations, may^^|H be summarised as follows:-^^^^M (i) Munitions Production^^^H No information of any strategic significance is published about employ-^^^H ment in, or production of, munitions.^^^H No information about food stocks is published, with the exception of^^^H stocks of raw sugar held in bonded warehouses.^^^H (iii) Raw Materials^^^H We assume that no information will be published about any type of^^^H strategic stock which the Government may decide to hold.^^^^m Commercial stocks of certain raw materials are known to and published^^^^M by the trade, and there are strong economic reasons against interference with^^^H commercial practice in this matter.^^^^M (iv) Electricity and GasWe consider that it would be advisable for defence reasons to cease the^^^H publication of detailed information about individual undertakings, though^^^H it must be recognised that information published in recent years by the^^^H independent undertakings has disclosed the pattern from which there can ^^fl^^^H be little deviation for many years to come, and that some release of informa-^^^H tion of this kind is of value to engineers and scientists.^^^H It is essential to maintain the publication of statistics for the country^^^H as a whole and for the principal regions.
(v) External tradeOnly commercial trade in munitions is recorded S,nd it will appear ill^^Ht  I the.corresponding trMe account of foreign countries.  Nd ifif&amp;&apos;rffiatibri aboutfissionable materials or about supplies to United Kingdom forces&apos; abroadI is published.1^ (vi) TransportI  Mr No objection is raised to the statistics at present published.(vii) Petroleum ^^flComparatively little information is published about petroleum, except inregard to imports; , More information is,, however, made available to theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation and the EconomicCo-operation Administration and, since the main statistics are collected bythe petroleum industry itself, these are known to a limited number of personsin the industry.The Ministry Of Fuel and Power is, at present, reviewing its policy on^^H|  I the publication of petroleum statistics with the object of reducing the riskthat information which is not published by the Ministry may be releasedI through the above channels. It is also considering the possibility of excludingfrom the Trade and Navigation Accounts cargoes brought in for thepurpose of strategic stock-piling, and at our suggestion this question has beenreferred to the Revising Committee on Trade Accounts.I Operational Intelligence5. The control of operational information presents much greater difficulties. ^^flI           Experience has, however, showfi that firms are normally disposed to co-operate in- the adoption of security precautions and to welcome advice on the subject. Thepresent safeguards are as follows:- .I (a) Officers of the Security Service, on behalf of the Admiralty and Ministryof Supply, visit from time to time firms holding secret GovernmentI contracts in order to advise them on the implementation of theircontractual obligations to safeguard the secret information theyI acquire. ^^fl(&amp;) There is a limited press censorship of air photographs of Key PointsI through the Defence (D) Notice procedure.  With a view to stoppingthe source of such photographs, the Ministry of Civil Aviation areI considering the issue of an appeal to air survey and charter firms,and possibly to air-crews and passengers.I (c) There is no public sale of Government maps, plans or charts of Key Points.The treatment of Key Points in published maps, plans and charts isI subject to security instructions agreed inter-Departmentally andfollowed by the Ordnance Survey.  These instructions are about to be ^^flI extended to cover Government air photographs and air photo-mosaics.(d) Security guidance on similar lines has been given to local planningauthorities in order that information about Key Points may not bedisclosed in surveys and development plans, to which by statute acertain amount of publicity has to be given.6. The Joint intelligence Committee pointed out that it was illogical toI         ,, restrict security safeguards to firms engaged on secret work, and they thereforeproposed that certain other firms and public authorities whose activities wereI of major importance to the war potential should be asked to agree voluntarilyto suppress certain types of information about their operations. We think thatI no serious difficulty should be encountered in securing the co-operation of theinterests concerned provided that we can define with reasonable precision theI type of information which they should refrain from publishing, and are able togive them a convincing explanation of the reasons why such publication may bedangerous.7. In their report, the Joint Intelligence Committee suggested that the KeyI             Points Lists held by the Ministry of Defence should be taken as the basis fordetermining what firms, local authorities, &amp;c, should be approached.   In these ^^flI 37172 B 2
Lists, Key Points are graded in three categories according to their importance^^^B for the war potential, and a summary showing the numbers in each category asat 31st December, 1948, is given in Annex II. We agree with the Committee&apos;ssuggestion, but we consider that we need concern ourselves at this stage only withthe Key Points in Category I.8. Nevertheless, there still remains the need to ensure that we do not makeunreasonable demands on the firms or public bodies concerned. Some firms control _Mnumerous factories, only some of which are listed as Key Points; not all the ^?^?^?l^^^h products even of factories listed as Key Points have a bearing on our war poten-tial. We must be sure that we do not ask such firms to suppress information, thesecrecy of which is not strictly necessary to the protection of the Key Points,and which may be very important to their normal commercial activities. Wethink that the solution is to be found by emphasising, in our approach to each ]concern, the need for safeguarding not so much Key Points as key commodities.9. If this criterion is adopted, it will be necessary to review the list of KeyPoints in Category I in order to determine the firms to which the initial approachshould be made. In doing so, it will be important to bear in mind that some ofthe most vital operational information concerns the primary producers, and thatthe most serious leakage of information, and the one which can be stopped withthe least inconvenience to industry generally, relates to any heavy concentration(or even monopoly) in the manufacture of a single component or raw material onwhich vital war industries depend.10. We therefore suggest that the aim should be to secure the co-operationof the undertakings concerned in the following arrangements:-(i) the following information should so far as possible be excluded from allpublic announcements, advertisements and other publicity material, .including articles written for- technical and trade journals- IWmS Generally(a) Such photographs, plans and details of buildings, processes andequipment as might identify and emphasise the more vulnerableparts of the undertaking and/or the precise position of the IFor factories(b) Statements which would clearly indicate in which of a numberof factories belonging to one company vital production is carriedout or key plant operated.(c) Information which would reveal that production which is part ofour war potential is wholly or mainly dependent either forcomponents or raw materials on a single United Kingdom &apos;source of supply.(d) Precise figures from which could easily be deduced either thecapacity of individual factories for a vital war product or^^^B their relative share of the total capacity.^^^H For petroleum refineries(e) Storage capacity. I(/) Details of production of different petroleum products.For gas works^^^1 (g) Capacity of units for gas-making and by-products.(A) Details of areas supplied by Key Point gas works and major^^^B industrial consumers served.^^^H (i) Lay-out of producing plant and gas-grid systems.For Electric Power Stations^^^fl (;) A list of details for suppression to be agreed in consultation withthe British Electric Authority.^^^H For other public utilities (ports, railways, water-works, &amp;c.)^^^H (k) Capacity.
I &apos; S - 1 153 I(ii) Senior members of the staff of the firms and public utilities concernedshould be warned not to make available information under the aboveheads to any organisation or individual not having a bona fide needfor it, and unless the information will be adequately safeguarded.(iii) Precautions should be taken to ensure that existing documents, plansand photographs giving information of the type referred to under (i)above are kept in a reasonably safe place and under adequate super-vision by responsible persons.(iv) Special precautions should be taken in the case of research and experi-mental work of vital importance.11. There seems little doubt that operational information of value to apotential enemy is published from time to time in technical and trade journals.In so far as such articles or photographs are published with the knowledge of thefirms and public authorities concerned, the action suggested in the preceding para-graph should ensure that care will be taken in future to avoid the disclosure ofvital information by this means. But publication may take place without pre-vious reference to the firm or authority involved, and we think that it may benecessary to consider whether an attempt should be made to secure the collabora-tion of the editors of the main technical and trade journals, and even of theleading advertising firms, in the adoption of voluntary arrangements comparablewith those which it is proposed to ask certain firms and&quot;public authorities to adopt.But this should clearly not be done until the consultations proposed in para-graph 10 have taken place; and we suggest that this question should be furtherexamined by the new Committee proposed in paragraph 13 below in the light ofthe views expressed by industry on the matter.12. We think that the suggested approach to industry can best be made,not by the various sponsoring Departments, but by the Security Service who, asindicated in paragraph 5 (a), already have experience in the application of securityto industry in a similar field; and we recommend that this should be done bypersonal consultation at the appropriate level rather than by letter. But, underthis procedure, the Security Service- would, of course, look to the Departmentsconcerned for advice on the selection of firms and for information and guidance HHon the handling of these we think that this procedure can appropriately be appliedto the socialised industries also.13. If our recommendations are adopted, points of difficulty may arise fromtime to time on which Departments may wish to obtain an agreed view; it mayalso be found necessary to consider, in the light of practical experience, whetherthe policy we have proposed needs to be modified or reviewed. There is at presentno machinery suitable for undertaking this work, and we recommend that a newinter-Departmental Committee should be set up for this purpose.Summary of Conclusions14. Our recommendations are therefore as follows:-(a) Strategic IntelligencePresent practice in regard to the publication of economic statistics shouldbe modified or reviewed as proposed in paragraph 4 (iv) and (vii)(b) Operational Intelligence(i) Undertakings concerned with Key Points in Category I of theKey Points Lists should be asked to agree voluntarily to suppresscertain types of information about their operations (paragraphs(ii) The main emphasis should be laid on the need for safeguarding keycommodities (paragraphs 8 and 9).(iii) The co-operation of the undertakings concerned should be soughtin the application of the safeguards set out in paragraph 10.(iv) The suggested approach to the concerns affected should be made bythe Security Service, after consultation with the various sponsor-ing Departments (paragraph 12).
^^^H (c) A new inter-Departmental Committee should be set tip for the coiisidera-^^^H tioh of issues of policy or practical problems arisitig out of these^^^H recommendations (paragraph 13).^^^h Signed on behalf of the Working Party,S. E. V. LUKE.Cabinet Office, S.W.I, I11th June, 1949. \M9ANNEX IStrategic IntelligenceA great amount of information about economic and industrial conditionsis now published which necessarily gives some indication in very broad terntsof our economic potential for war purposes. So long as we are dependent onMarshall Aid and are committed to participating in a joint recovery programmeunder the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation, the publication ofdetailed economic information is inevitable, and it is the declared policy of theGovernment to make this information available. . We are required to providethe Organisation of European Economic Co-operation with figures of supplies,consumption and stock changes for a wide range of commodities and forecastshave been given up to 1952. Moreover, it is essential that industry and tradeshould have comprehensive and detailed published statistics, as in the United _States, in order that the highly complex economic system Of this rountry, stillbased primarily on private enterprise, should function smoothly. Many firms nowhave their own statistical sections and are persistent in demands for detailedstatistical information.2.   In examining the statistics published at present, attention has, therefore,been directed principally to published information about munitions productionand stocks, and to information about the capacity of particular public utilityRll undertakings and port installations.Munitions production8. No figures are published at present of employment on munitions ormilitary aircraft. Regular monthly figures are published by the Ministry ofLabour showing the number of persons employed in the principal industries, buta single figure is given in each case for motor vehicles, cycles and aircraft andfor all kinds of marine engineering. Figures of the number of operatives employedin each trade have been given in the Census of Production for 1935; althoughfigures of employment in the Aircraft Trade were given they related to thetrade as a whole and no distinction was made between civil and military aircraft.4. A considerable amount of information is published monthly of theprincipal products of the engineering and other industries. No information,however, is published of the output of munitions, military aircraft or navalproduction and repairs. In the Census of Production information is collectedand was published before the war showing the number and value of aeroplanesproduced, but military aircraft were not distinguished. It is not thought thatthe Census of Production reveals anything of importance from the point of view^^fl of security. The Board of Trade will, in any case, consult the Joint IntelligenceCommittee before publishing any statistics which might possibly be objectionable.The detailed reports of the Census of Production will inevitably be published onlyafter some considerable interval.5. With the exception of stocks of dutiable articles in bonded warehouses,figures for which are published each month in the Trade Accounts, figures ofstocks of food are not published. Estimates of these stocks have been made bythe Economist from the published figures of imports, exports and consumptionbut these vary in their degree of accuracy and the error will no doubt increaseas time passes.? #|9 l
I 154 HRaw Materials. 6. Stocks of some of the principal raw materials (other than petroleum) arepublished regularly in the Monthly Digest of Statistics. For some raw materialssuch as rubber, and for some of the non-ferrous metals such as tin, regular and-comprehensive statistics are published by trade associations and other bodies.I . (a) Rubber$ $ 7.   Since July 1948 Government stocks of natural rubber have not beenpublished. From the figures of imports, exports and consumption it is possibleto make a rough estimate of total stocks, but the inaccuracy of such estimates willprobably increase with time. It is doubtful, however, whether it is either prac-ticable or wise to suppress information about imports or consumption. It wouldbe useless to suppress figures of imports unless the supplying countries agreed tosuppress the corresponding figures from their trade accounts. Moreover, accurateand complete information about production, consumption and stocks of rubber isessential both to the Malayan producers and to consumers, and the suppression ofsuch information might seriously endanger supplies of natural rubber. Theunknown size of the United States Government&apos;s holding of rubber is said atpresent to be exerting a depressing influence on production of natural rubber.(&amp;).Non-ferrous Metals8. There are Government-held stocks of all non-ferrous metals (copper,lead, zinc, tin, aluminium and magnesium). These are, however, held only becausethe Ministry of Supply controls imports and distribution and are not ear-marked,like rubber, for non-commercial purposes. Figures are published in the MonthlyBulletin of the British Bureau of Non-ferrous Metal Statistics, in the MonthlyStatistical Bulletin of the International Tin Study Group and also in theMonthly Digest. Annual figures only of aluminium and magnesium stocksrelating to the end of 1947 were recently published in the last issue of the AnnualAbstract. Again&gt; it would be possible, in the absence of stock figures to make-estimates of varying degree of accuracy from the published information. As withrubber, the provision of comprehensive statistics about the principal non-ferrousmetals is of the greatest importance to the industries concerned.Electricity and Gas9. In June 1948 the Electricity Commission published a return of engineer-ing and financial statistics relating to authorised undertakings for the year 1946.This return gives particulars for each undertaking of the system of supply, plantinstalled, with figures of maximum load, load factor, units generated, units pur--chased in bulk, units sold and the number of consumers of electricity, particulars^^fl of capital raised and expended.   A return published this year gives particularsof units generated and sent out for each undertaking. A similar annual returnrelating to gas undertakings for the year 1946 was published by the Ministry ofFuel and Power in 1948. Summary information about gas and electricity up tothe year 1947 was published recently in the Ministry of Fuel and Power&apos;s Statis-tical Digest, but no details were given of individual undertakings.I External Trade Statistics10. Stores for the naval, military and air forces carried on Governmentvessels and captured enemy military equipment imported by Government Depart-ments are excluded from the recorded figures of imports. Similarly BritishGovernment-owned stores exported for British Government use abroad areexcluded from the statistics of exports.   From 1st January, 1947, imports offissionable materials are no longer recorded in the Trade Accounts.  From 1946, .^^Himports by-Government Departments of munitions and exports to any Governmentare included under the appropriate Import and Export List headings. Thusimports and exports of aeroplanes are recorded, but no distinction is drawnbetween civil and military types.   The possible suppression of the figures ofexports of civil aircraft has already been raised by the Ministry of Supply withthe Joint Intelligence Committee. Exports of war vessels are given in the monthlyTrade Accounts, but no analysis by type is revealed.11. The suppression of information given in our Trade Accounts will ingeneral be of little value unless arrangements can be made to suppress the corres-ponding figures recorded in the Trade Accounts of foreign countries.
???fl ^1Transport^^^H 12.   No objection is raised to the published figures relating to railways.^^^^1 shipping and civil aviation.   Lloyd&apos;s Register gives complete details of everymerchant vessel registered, but this is regarded as essential to shipping.13. Statistics of shipping movement at United Kingdom ports are published^^^^1                  monthly in the Board of Trade Journal.   Figures for tankers are not givenseparately.   Figures are given for groups of ports, but not for individual ports.^^^H Petroleum Products14. Comparatively little information is published about petroleum products.^^^H For each of the main products figures of imports and of the quantities of imported^^^H hydrocarbon oils retained for consumption are given in the Trade Accounts.^^^H Aviation spirit is not distinguished but is included in motor spirit. Similar^^^H figures for each year are given in the Ministry of Fuel and Power&apos;s Statistical^^|H Digest together with figures of the quantities refined and distilled from imported^^^H crude oils and produced and refined from indigenous petroleum. No figures of^^^H stocks are published and it would not be possible to estimate the level of stocks^^^H from the other published figures. The figures of stocks circulated within^^^H                  Government Departments are marked Top Secret.^^^H 15.   No information is published of the consumption of petroleum productsby the Services.ANNEX II^^^M Key Points Listed by K.P.I.D./(J.I.B.), 31st December, 1948H Factories ^^fl^^^H Cat. 1 Cat. 2 Total Emergency316 635 951 823Non-FactoryCat. 1        Cat. 2        Total Emergency^^^H , Compressed Gases  (Oxy- ^^fl^^^H gen,   Hvdrogen andNitrogen)     ...      ... 3 3 6 4Docks and Harbours    ...       35 10 45 90Electricity...  ^JBj    ???       85 58 143 27Food ......... 115 188 303 100 |?
