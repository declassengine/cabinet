SECRETCP. (k10)  11720TH MAY.  1949TELEGRAPH bill memorandum by the Postmaster-general at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting&apos; on 19th May(CM.(49) 36th Conclusions, Minute 2), I was invited tosubmit a further memorandum showing how the proposedtelephone rental increases could best be imposed in thevarious classes of contract by notice to individualsubscribers,  and the extent to which revenue would be lost by adopting this procedure for introducing the increases.2. The normal procedure would bo to send, byregistered post as is required by the Telegraph Regulations,a notice to each subscriber terminating his agreement oragreements on a certain date.   The notice would specify theagreements by their dates..    It would be accompanied by afresh agreement form; on which would be entered in detail the items rented, the addresses where they were installedand the rental at the new rates, together with a request forthe form to be signed and returned to the Post Office.Business installations are ever 40?o of the whole, and ofthese a large number will have many items - in the biggestcases running to thousands.    Questions as to the accuracy ofthe entries would have to be answered and failures to return the forms would have to be followed up.    In this connection,it is material that subscribers are only supplied with acopy of the contract on request.   Paced with new and detailed contracts,  they would, undoubtedly, in many cases,set about a check-up of the accuracy of the items set out and a study of the unfamiliar conditions of the contract.Considerable correspondence and delay would inevitablyfollow and in addition failures to return the forms wouldhave to be followed up.    This full procedure, includingensuring that a contract is returned before the operationof the new charges, was estimated, to take on the averagetwenty minutes of staff time for each agreement.   Theestimate is necessarily conjectural so far as thesubscribers&apos;  reactions and consequential correspondence isconcerned:    on review it is,  in fact,  felt to- be too low.3. Since the previous paper was prepared,  the questionwhether this long procedure can be reduced has been examined further.    It is now considered that a simpler process could produce an effective contract.    That process would be tosend out individual notices of termination of agreement in uniform terms which would,  (a) refer in general terms to thesubscribers&apos; agreements for telephone service withoutdetailing or identifying them,  (b) terminate subscribers&apos;agreements as at a uniform named date or at the date ofexpiry of the initial term,  (c) state, in effect,  that asubscriber wishing to continue to receive service after thedate mentioned must complete a simple tear-off form whichwould write into his new contract the terms ana. conditionsCOPY NO. 1CABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

of the terminated contract, save that as. regards charges,items hitherto subject to surcharge would become subject toincrease of 33i:/S over the basic charges in theterminated agreement.   Under this method the subscriber would receive no details of the lines and apparatus, nor would hebe given the actual figures of his new rental, etc.   a notice on these lines could,  I am advised, be devised whichwould be legally effective, but the arrangement can only be worked at the expense of continuing the conditions ofexisting contracts,  including the rather unsatisfactoryprovisions for making changes in charges, which I have alwayshad in mind to alter if we were faced with the renewal of contracts without legislation.    (I am, in any case, goingto pursue this point for future new contracts-,.)    It isestimated that it would reduce the average staff time required to 15 minutes for of,  say, 18,000 man weeks,resulting correspondence would be increased or reducedunder this method is problematical,each agreement, making a totalilthough the guest ion whether4* For the purpose of this shorter method sane3,000,000 notice forms would be required, differing inprinted detail for the 56 telephone areas of the countryand also for various categories of subscribers.   these could not bejlevised, printed, addressed and distributedbefore 30th June.   Consequently the higher rates of chargecould not be brought into force on 1st October.   nor would,any attempt to deal,first with the 3 months noticesubscribers get over the difficulty.   Since it is imperative to adhere to a quarter day for the rate change,the earliest operative date would be 1st January, 1930.5. In view of the objections raised at the cabinet meeting -to the proposal to send out a general notification of increased charges until legislation had received theRoyal Assent, it is, of course,  impossible to adhere even under the legislation method to the date (1st October)proposed in the Bill for the increase in rentals to operategenerally.   The Bill would have to be altered to makethe date 1st January, 1930, the same date as under the short procedure set out above.6. The substitution of 1st January, 1950, for 1st1st October, 192+9, would mean that the Budget receipts fromthe increase in rentals in 1949-50 would come down from 1 million to about  400,000.7. I should, I think, makesubscribers would in fact be fiincreases.   Accounts are for a hrental charge being three monthsmonths in advance - but accountsto roughly half the subscribers.(a)    accounts sent out early inJanuary, 1950, to, say,1,500,000 subscribersclear the dates on whichst called on to pay thealf year&apos;s survice -in arrear and threeare sent out each quarterThe:&apos;foct is as follows:3 monthsat new r3 monthsadvance rental.tesarrear rentalat old rates.(b) accounts sent out early inApril, 1950, to remaining1,500,000 subscribers(c) accounts sent out early inJuly, 1950, to subscribersat (a)6 months rental at newrates6 monthsrates *&apos;ental at new

8, In other words, it is not until-July, 1950, thatall subscribers will have felt the full effect of thenew rotes.9. If the proposed legislation is not proceeded with,,a rather difficult situation arises in regard to HullCorporation, which would be statutorily bound under theAct of 1940 to collect the 15% surcharge from theirsubscribers for the Exchequer.   This arrangement has long been felt to be unfair to Hullj   in the case of thePost Office, this quantum of surcharge is now absorbed by costs, i.e., it cannot be regarded as war taxation.The Corporation are, of course, aware of the chancellor sstatement in his Budget Speech of the intention tointroduce legislation for raising telephone charges and theyhave been informed that the Bill would repeal the 1940Act as it applies to them.    I think that we should, in any event, relieve Hull Corporation by a short Bill.W.P.POST OFFICE HEADQUARTERS, E.C.I.,20th May, 1949.-
