ES DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret copy NO. HGmP*(k10) 11316 Til MAY, 19U9CABINETGREECEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsStatement of problemMy colleagues will be interested to know; that theSoviet Representative at the United Nations General Assemblyhas made proposals in New York to the Minister of State and toMr. Rusk of the United States State Department for a settlementof the Greek civil war on the basis of the rebel peace offer of20th Aprilo   These proposals contemplate a cease-fire under the auspices of the Great Powers, a general amnesty &quot;on both sidesSi,fresh elections under the supervision either of an ad hoc bodyrepresenting both sides or of a United Nations commission, andthe eventual &quot;normalisation&quot; of relations between Greece and her northern neighbours.2. The proposals are quite unacceptable as they stand.They place both parties to.the civil war on a basis of equalityand they would, if accepted, enable the communists by means ofrenewed infiltration and trickery to retrieve their fortunesfrom the low level to which the determination of the Greekpeople has consigned them.    It would, however, in my opinionbe a mistake to return a completely negative answer to theSoviet overture since, apart from anything else, there is always the possibility that it may reflect a genuine desire on thepart of the Soviet Government to compose their differences with us in this part of the world,  if only for temporary tacticalreasons.   Because of this possibility it seems essential toreach agreement with the United States Government on what ourminimum requirements would be for a general settlement in thearea concerned before any substantive answor is returned.    Ihave therefore instructed H.M. Ambassador in Washington to askMr. Acheson whether he would be willing to take the opportunityof our meeting in Paris for the Council of Foreign Ministers tojoin me in making a detailed study of our position in the balkans and I have instructed the Minister of State to send an interimand non-committal reply to the Soviet Representative^R e c recommend t i on. Assuming that Mr. Acheson accepts my suggestion,I shall be glad of authority to examine with him in Paris the besmethod of making use of the Soviet overture so as to achieve notonly   a cease-fire in Greece but a general settlement of outstanding Balkan problems.

A.   GreeceU* Military operations have not been going too wellfor the rebels;    the difficulties of supplying them have been increased by the defection of Yugoslavia;    and communist influence among the Greek population as a whole has dwindled,partly as the result of successful police action in destroyingsecret comimunist organisations and partly as the result of a genuine popular revulsion against the traitorous role of theGreek Communist Party.    The object of the Soviet Government isno doubt to enable them to recover from this unfavourablesituation and to prepare the way for a nev\T lease of life for theGreek Communist Party.    Having failed &quot;to destroy the GreekState by force from wi without, the Soviet Government would now liketo regain the opportunity of subverting it from within by&quot;lawful&quot; infiltration.   They may also wish to have their handsfree to deal with Yugoslavia and may even be activated by fearof an entente of some kind between Yugoslavia and Greece.5. The Soviet proposals are unacceptable as they standbecause:(i) tlie Greek Government would rightly refuse to agreeto take part in any scheme which placed the rebeljunta on the same juridical basis as themselves;(ii)    they would, rightly, insist on a rebel surrenderbeing a prerequisite of any settlement;   and(iii)   Soviet representation in any international bodysupervising an amnesty accompanying the cessation of hostilities or supervising new elections would,unless special safeguards were devised, give- the Soviet Government endless opportunities of makinga genuine and favourable settlement impossible.St The Greek Government would have to be persuaded t(. Lonif it could somehow be made innocuous.7. Our aim should therefore be to endeavour, withoutappearing unreasonable or obstructive, to exclude the SovietGovernment from participation in the supervision of a cease-fire,general amnesty or elections.   At most, we might concede the principle of Soviet participation in the supervision of newelections provided that the Western powers were satisfiedthat conditions under which a fair and free election could beheld had first been achieved in Greece.   At best, many monthsmust pass before any such conditions could exist.8. Dr. Evatt, President of the United Nations Assembly,is also continuing his attempts to conciliate Greece and hernorthern neighbours.    These broke down last November mainly because the Yugoslav Government were unwilling to conclude a frontier agreement with Greece.   A contributory cause may well have been Greek insistence on reserving the right to raisethrough the appropriate channel their claim to Northern Epirus.The present position is understood to be that the Greeks willinsist on no explicit reservation on this point in any draft agreement to be discussed with Albania but will not agree to anytext which even by implication might suggest that their claimhad been foregone.Background and considerations

B.    Other Balkan Pr obi ems:(i) Yugoslavia9* Since the breach between Tito and the Cominform, thescale of Yugoslav assistance to the Greek rebels has steadilydwindled.    This was noted in the September report of the united nations Special Committee on the Balkans and has been publiclyindicated by the recent removal of the rebel radio station fromYugoslav territory.   Cominforra attacks on Yugoslavia, whichhave included stirring up Macedonian aspirations-to inde-pendence,  have brought Yugoslavia to the point of being anxious for a settlement with Greece,  though she finds it difficult toreach agreement with the present Greek Government.10. There is a risk that the settlement of the civil warin Greece with active Soviet &quot;assistance1&apos; would lead to increased Soviet pressure on Tito,  and in any general Balkansettlement it might be well to demand from the SovietGovernment the cessation of economic and political pressure onTito by the Cominform and to suggest that he should be allowedto reach his own modus Vivendi with the Western Powers, and with greece.(ii) Albania11. Albania has been the principal Soviet base forassistance to the rebels, although material can now only reachthat country from the Soviet orbit countries by sea and air.The internal position of the country is unstable and discontentedelements might at some stage overthrow the Hoxha government.Albania maintains no relations with any of the Western Powersexcept Prance and Italy and by the recent Hague Court decision was held responsible for the mining of the two British destroyers in the Corfu Channel in October, 1946.   She is the weakest ofthe satellites and one of the most intransigent towards Greece.12. The Greek Government maintain their claim to northern Epirus (Southern Albania) but declare that this willbe pursued through appropriate international channels.   any settlement reached between Greece and Albania as a result of dr. Evatt&apos;s negotiations or any other discussions would have totake this claim into consideration.   It might, however^ benecessary for the United States Government and ourselves to try to induce the Greeks to abandon this claim as the price ofobtaining a settlement with Albania.(iii)   Bulgaria13, The Greek Government have made successive attempts to resume relations with Bulgaria since the signature of the peace treaty;    these have been rebuffed and twisted into propagandaadverse to Greece.    Bulgaria has failed (except for one smalltoken delivery) to carry out her obligations in respect of reparations to Greece or oven to discuss questions of claims and restitution as laid down in the Peace Treaty.   Bulgariahas also foiled to observe other provisions of the Peace Treaty(e.g. human righto) and, as has been established by successivereports of the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans,has furnished assistance to the.Greek rebels.14. Our optimum demands in a general settlement wouldbe for the cessation of aid by Bulgaria to the rebels, the resump-tion of diplomatic, relations with Greece and the discussion of reparations and restitution under the Peace Treaty.    It would be

unrealistic to insist on Bulgarian compliance with the more general articles of the Peace Treaty which diplomatic action by the Western Powers has so far failed to enforce *(iv)   Cyprus15. Communist activity in Cyprus is able to profit fromthe desire of the Greek population of the island for union with greece.   The ultimate object of the communists is to impedeor deny the use of the island for strategic purposes.    It isknown that the United States Government are concerned atcommunist activity on the island.    In any general settlement ourposition must be made clear.(v)    Turkey16. Cessation of Soviet pressure on Greece might be accompanied by the renewal of .pressure on Turkey for the cession of bases on the Straits,  together with a revival of claims on the north-eastern provinces of Turkey.   Turkishpublic opinion is apprehensive, particularly in view of the omission of Turkey from the Atlantic Pact, although they have theUnited States&apos; and our guarantees.   We may see some intensificatioof the war of nerves against Turkey.17. Any general settlement in the Balkans would require a soviet guarantee that no further pressure on Turkey would beexerted.(vi)   General18. It will be noted that in the foregoing paragraphsoptimum demands on the Soviet Government have been formulated.It would be a matter for discussion with the United states representatives what our minimum requirements would be in eachof the areas mentioned above.E .B .Foreign Office, S.W.1.,16th May, 1949.



THE HAVANA CHARTER FOR AM INTERNATIONAL TRADE ORGANISATIONCP. (h-9) 114 dated 10th May, 1949The United States Government did not after all ratify the Havana Charter.    The passage on procedure and timing in the memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade is therefore out of date.Until it is known what action the United states administration will be taking the matter will lie dormant.In any case the president of the Board of Trade will need to circulate a fresh memorandum when the time comes toraise the subject again.
