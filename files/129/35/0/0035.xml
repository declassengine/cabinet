Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1949&apos;SECRET Cof No. 31CP. (49) 145Qth July, 1949CABINETTHE DOCK LABOUR INDUSTRY AND THE NATIONAL dock labour board memorandum by the Minister of transport. I have expressed to the Cabinet from time to time my grave concern aboutthe. frequent disputes in the dock labour industry, often involving considerable and costly delays to ships and cargoes, and sometimes necessitating the use ofService personnel to handle essential cargoes, with consequent interruption oftraining. As a result of previous consideration of these problems by the Cabinet,it was decided (CM. (48) 45th Conclusions, Minute 1) to invite the Foreign Secre-tary to discuss with the Minister of Labour and myself means of improving theorganisation of the Board and of forestalling further industrial disturbances in the docks. I am not aware that there has been any discussion affecting theorganisation of the Board, although, arising out of a London dispute of June,1948, an enquiry into the amenities provided for dock workers was carried out bythe National Dock Labour Board and a report was prepared, which, after con-sideration by the Lord &quot;Presidents Committee, is being examined by an inter-Departmental working party.2.&apos; I now feel that the question of the organisation of the dock labourindustry and the Board requires examination in the light of recent experience and to facilitate consideration of the matter I have prepared, and annex, someparticulars of disputes which have occurred since 1st January, 1948, and theestimated losses involved (Annex B.) The statement, which does not necessarilycover all disputes which resulted in delays to shipping, shows a total loss of3,673 ship days since the beginning of 1948. The most serious of these disputeswere (a) the one at London in June, 1948, which started over the payment for handling of a &quot; dirty &quot; cargo, and which eventually evolved into a strike againstdisciplinary action taken under the scheme; (b) the further strike at London inApril of this year arising from the dismissal by the Board of ineffective workers;and (c) the recent stoppages at Bristol and Liverpool and now London in sympathy with the strike of Canadian seamen. It was the June, 1948, strike at Londonwhich led to the declaration of a state of emergency under the Emergency powers act, 1920, and is the only instance since the present Government took office inwhich it became necessary to take powers under the emergency machinery.3. A disturbing feature of these disputes is the willingness of the men to strike, not primarily against the employers, but in defiance of their own unions and of the National Dock Labour Board, which, as my colleagues will be aware,has a governing body consisting of members nominated by the two sides of theindustry, with an independent Chairman and Vice-Chairman appointed by theMinistry of Labour after consultation with both sides of the industry.4. There would not appear on the surface any good reason for discontentin the dock labour industry. The industry, as a result of the introduction ofdecasualisation during the war and the placing of decasualisation arrangements on a permanent basis under the existing dock labour scheme, enjoys substantiallyimproved conditions. The wages earned compare favourably with those of other major industrial groups, particularly in respect of over-time and piece-workrates, which are more applicable to a casual industry than to one in which thereare guaranteed weekly wages.   The average weekly earnings of dock workers in37237 this DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
October 1948 were  7 19s. 2d., which compared with  8 5s. 9d. for adult (male)workers in the coal-mining industry,  7 6s. Od. in the engineering ship-building, &amp;c, industry, and  6 10s. 7d. in the building contracting industry, and(in April 1948)  6 17s. lid. in the railway industry. These earnings by dockershave been achieved during a period when surpluses of labour have been in theneighbourhood of 15 per cent, on the average, and by a labour force about 16 percent, of which are over sixty years of age. Many of the dockers, of course, earn a great deal more than the average figure, either because they obtain more regular employment or work at piece-work rates on particularly favourable cargoes. Itis not uncommon for dockers to earn as much as  15 in a week of full employment.5. The readiness of the dockers to come out on strike arises largely fromthe casual conditions which existed before the war, when solidarity among the dockers was the natural reaction against the dangers of exploitation of theworkers in an over-manned industry. Traditionally, moreover, the dock workersbargain over the rate of payment in respect of any difficult or unusual cargobefore starting work on it, and this has often meant that particular ships, aswill be seen from Annex B, become sources of dispute between the employersand the men. It will be appreciated in this connexion that the Dock Labour board are not themselves employers of labour. They are the suppliers of labour to the master stevedores, master porters and others, but they also provide the machineryby which payment is made both in respect of the work done and in respect ofperiods when no work is available. (A brief note on the relationship of thevarious interests concerned in the utilisation of dock labour is attached as annex A.) Although the scheme does in fact ensure that dock workers haveregular payments regardless of whether work is available or not, the dock workerstill seems to think of himself as having the freedom of the casual worker to choose the work he will do and the conditions under which he will do it. Thereis, in fact, adequate industrial machinery for settling questions of payment andconditions of work, and the Dock Labour Scheme provides means of settlingdisciplinary questions and gives rights of appeal to suitably constituted bodies,but dockers will frequently strike and be supported by other dockers without waiting for the arbitration machinery to work or in defiance of the decisions reached. Sometimes impatience with the arbitration machinery is understandable,as considerable time may elapse before decisions of arbitrators can be given.fj. A distressing feature of the present situation is that the improvements which have been made in the status and earnings of the dock workers have notinstilled in them the spirit of co-operation that might reasonably have been hoped for. Broadly speaking, the men seem unable to develop a sense of loyalty to theBoard, to the stevedoring employers or to their own Trade Union leaders. Theywill readily listen to malcontents who try to exploit any cause of friction, andthey accept fresh leaders for nearly every unofficial stoppage of work.7. The strike leaders who instigate and sustain these unofficial stoppagesare, generally speaking, men who have ho regard for the repercussions oi their actions on the country&apos;s trade and on the community. Their activities may wellbring a whole port to a standstill, resulting in serious loss to shipowners and. traders, and hampering the country&apos;s economic recovery; but despite all the losses which they cause, these unofficial leaders incur no penalty for their misdeeds.8. It is not too much to say that the dock workers claim the benefits ofdecasualisation without being willing to give up practices appropriate to thecasual system. The failure to achieve any fundamental change in the mentalityof the dock worker as a result of several years of decasualisation must, in part,be attributed to the fact that the shortage of shipping and commodities has made it inexpedient for the Government or employers to face any major or prolongedstoppage in the industry and strikes have therefore been undertaken by the dockworkers with relative impunity. In the ordinary way the National Dock labour board make their payments on the Thursday or Friday following the week inwhich the money has been earned and, in consequence, dock workers who strikedo not immediately feel the loss of wages. Moreover, under the P.A.Y.E. system,they are generally entitled to some repayment of income tax in the first week ortwo that follows a period in which there have been no earnings. The consequenceis that there is a tendency for the dock workers, for the reasons indicated, totake a light-hearted view of any strike which does not last more than a week or so.   In particular, a strike started and finished just before a holiday period
often has the losses compensated for by high earnings during the holiday perioditself, when rates may be- double those earned on ordinary working days.9. A serious weakness of the present scheme is the joint administration bythe employers and employees, which is not paralleled in any other industry..&quot; Works Councils &quot; on which there is joint representation by employers and employees are, of course, a common feature of many industries to-day, but the function of these Councils is mainly advisory and I know of no other instance inthis country in which the representatives of the workers share with the employers&apos;representatives the actual management of the undertaking as they do in the docks scheme. Under this system of management, the trade union representatives on the Board cannot effectively advocate or take such action as would be appro-priate to employers, while they lose the confidence of the dock workers as tradeunion representatives because they appear in the role of employers.When the Bill for the Dock Workers (Regulation of. Employment) Act, 1946,was in preparation, my Ministry were instrumental in obtaining its amendmentso as to allow of schemes being prepared which could be administered by port authorities locally without national control or joint administration by employersand employees. When the time came, however, for the Act to be put into force,a scheme on these lines was, in fact, advocated by the employers but it did not meet with the approval of the trade unions, who preferred a joint scheme on thelines of that then in operation under the Dock Labour Corporation, and it was this latter type of administration which was adopted..    10.   For some time there has been a feeling among employers that dockworkers should, in return for the benefits they receive, accept their responsibilitiesunder the Dock Labour Scheme, which has been freely negotiated by their leaders and. in the administration of which they are represented.   Not all the strikeswhich I have listed in Annex B to this memorandum are strikes directly in breach of the Dock Labour Scheme, but it is a feature of the recent disputes at Avonmouthand Liverpool, which will be fresh in my colleagues&apos; minds, that employers haveinsisted on their rights under the scheme to obtain labour to work all ships, andin my view this is a reasonable request, for it seems to me most desirable thatthe dock workers should not be allowed to refuse to accept the requirements of thescheme designed by the Government primarily for their benefit.11. It would, of course, be quite wrong to overstate the case and to suggestthat the effects of the present scheme have been wholly negative. Past experienceindicates that there is no cause for supposing that conditions in the industry would have been better if the scheme had not been established or that there wouldhave been less unrest among the dockers under the old system; the disputesprobably would have been much more serious. The problem with which we are faced is that the National Dock Labour Board was set up to remedy the grievancesof the dockers and to create settled conditions in the industry and, despite all the care which has been put into the preparation and administration of the scheme,it has to a considerable extent failed to achieve this object. While there canbe no question of going back to the conditions of casual labour which existed in pre-war days, some revision or modification of the present arrangements is,,in my view, urgently needed if we are to avoid a succession of these costly andirritating unofficial strikes.12. I am certain that, unless something is done now to place the dock labour Scheme on a more workable basis, there will be a progressive deterioration-tion in the conditions which now exist in the docks and which may lead to a major dispute of a most dangerous character. I have considered, therefore,whether or not the time has come to ask for the Dock Labour Scheme itself tobe the subject for review.The following are some of the proposals which I consider deserve examina-tion: (i) The Minister of Labour is so closely identified with the Dock labour board that the question arises whether his conciliation functions arethereby weakened and whether it would be an advantage if the Minis-ter of Transport were substituted for the Minister of Labour as theMinister responsible to the Government and Parliament for the dock labour Scheme and the appointment of the National Board. this change would require legislation.37237 b 2
(ii) Reference has already been made to the difficulties which arise fromthe fact that the National Board is mainly, and the Local Boardsare wholly, made up of representatives of the Unions and employersconcerned. An alternative method could be to change the constitutionof the National and Local Boards by reducing the number of union and employer representatives, increasing the number of independent members of the National Board, and adding independent members to the Local Boards. (To make this more acceptable, it might bepossible to select some of the independent members from panels nomi-nated by both sides.) Boards so constituted might be expected toreach quicker and firmer decisions on questions of policy, and be moreready to take decisive action.(iii) The relations between the National and Local Boards might be re-examined. In particular it may be necessary to consider the relationsbetween the National Board and the Local Boards on disciplinarymatters. It is probably true to say that the present Boards have failed, not in minor disciplinary matters, but in the application of discipline to groups. With Boards constituted as in (ii) above, andwith a properly controlled delegation to Local Boards, it may be hopedthat discipline would be more likely to be secured.(iv) The machinery for appeal from disciplinary action should be examined.There may be a case for imposing automatic sanctions for breaches of the scheme by registered dock workers. Under the present scheme,every registered worker is assumed to have accepted the obligations of the scheme and is required, if available for work, to carry out the directions of the Local Board and accept any employment in connec-tion with dock work for which he is considered suitable. When a registered dock worker is available for work and fails without adequate cause to comply with the conditions of the scheme, he losesentitlement to attendance money in respect of the appropriate pay-week and renders himself liable to suspension or dismissal by theLocal Board, although there is a right of appeal to an Appeals Tri-bunal. These penalties do not seem sufficiently certain or drastic inthe case of men who deliberately flout the scheme from which theybenefit, and the scheme might be amended to provide for the automaticdismissal of any man who does not observe its provisions to the extent,  :       of refusing work for which he is available and suitable.(v) It might help to bring about more settled conditions in the industryif there were an extension of the system under which dockers are attached semi-permanently to a particular stevedoring employer as&quot;weekly workers.&quot; Such workers are registered with the national dock Labour Board but have a guaranteed period of regular employ-ment with&apos;the employer concerned. At present they represent about16 per cent, of the total registered dock labour force. The advantageof this system is that it gives the docker a greater sense of continuityin his work, and an extension of this arrangement might foster a spiritof loyalty to the employer. This is a proposal about which the Unionswill probably be divided,(vi) Another practice which seems to warrant encouragement is the volun-tary joining together of men in gangs who regularly work as a unit,though not necessarily for the&apos; same employer. This fosters teamspirit and self-discipline, and is not open to the criticism sometimesmade against the &quot; weekly worker &quot; system that the men attached to particular stevedoring companies always get the most profitable andcongenial jobs to do, leaving the unpopular jobs for the &quot; daily men.&quot;13. It will be seen that practically all the proposals set out above involve some change in the scheme which would require either the agreement of the two sides of the industry or, alternatively, fresh legislation to impose the suggestedalteration in the machinery. I think they deserve examination and probably thebest way of dealing with the matter would be for a working party representingthe Ministries of Labour and Transport, the Board, the Employers and the TradeUnions, the British Transport Commission and independent Port Authorities toconsider in detail these suggestions together with any other proposals whichmight be put forward, and to endeavour to devise a scheme of administration
which would minimise the present causes of friction. Particular attention would need to be given to the procedure for dealing with redundancy and the elimination of ineffective Workers from the industry, :14. If, as a result of the deliberations of the working party, it is decidedto make any modifications in organisation and procedure under the scheme, i recommend that any proposed change should be preceded by a propaganda cam-paign designed to explain that its purpose is to ensure that the scheme is workedhonestly and effectively by both sides of the industry. In any such campaignwe should need the fullest co-operation of the Trade Unions. The Union leaderswould benefit themselves no less than the scheme by the restoration of the- men&apos;confidence in their leadership, especially if it could be made clear to the dockworkers that they cannot indefinitely claim the benefits of the schemes withoutaccepting its obligations.A.

ANNEX AFunctions and Relations of the Organisations concerned with theOperation, &amp;c, of the ports the organisations concerned with the operation, &amp;c. of a port are many anddiverse in character.   A brief summary of their functions is given below.A. The Port authority in most cases the port authority is a statutory body, but whether statutory ornot the authority&apos;s main function is the provision and maintenance of the docks,quays, locks, sheds, warehouses and cranes and certain other equipment for theloading or discharge of goods. They receive their funds from the dues whichare raised on the ships and cargoes making use of the ports.B. National Dock Labour board a statutory body which is the &quot; legal employer &quot; of some 75,000 registeredport transport workers in the most important ports of Great Britain. The porttransport workers, usually knoWn as dock workers, are engaged by the masterstevedores or master porters, who obtain their labour from the National dock labour Board, for the loading and discharging of ships, and the movement orstorage of cargoes within the dock estate. The Board obtains its funds by raisinga levy on the stevedoring employers.C. The National Association of Port EmployersAn association of stevedoring employers. The employers range in size fromthe Manchester Ship Canal Company to one-man firms. All stevedoring workin Manchester is performed by the Canal Company, whilst in London there are about 800 employers.D. The National Joint Council for the Port Transport industry a. Council composed of representatives of the stevedoring employers and theTrade Unions in which the dock workers are organised. The Council deals with matters of national importance to the industry, and provides the industrialmachinery for the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment,including hours of work, holidays with pay, &amp;c. There are local joint committees in the individual ports.E. Trade UnionsThe dock workers are organised in several trade unions, of which the largestis the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union. Negotiations between the unions and the Employers are carried out without the intervention of any other organisa-tion which may be interested in the operation of a port.F. ShipownersThe shipowners themselves have their own organisations, such as the Chamberof Shipping and the Liverpool Steamship Owners&apos; Association. Shipowners arenot responsible in any way for the operations of a port, but merely use the portsas a means of unloading and loading cargoes. They are sometimes engaged instevedoring work.G. Appeal TribunalsWhere a registered dock worker available for work fails to comply withany of the provisions of the scheme, the Local Dock Labour Board may (a) determine that for such period as it thinks proper he shall not beentitled to any payment of attendance money;(6) suspend him without pay for a period not exceeding seven days;(c) give him seven days&apos; notice of termination of employment, or(d) dismiss him summarily.If aggrieved by the decision of the Board, the docker has a right of appealto an appeal tribunal. The tribunal is appointed by the Local Dock Labour Boardon the nomination of the Port Joint Committee and usually consists of an employer,a dockers&apos; representative and an independent chairman. The decision of thetribunal is given by a majority vote.
