Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1963C. (63) 24 Copy No.    **219th February, 1963CABINETTHE FUTURE OF SHORTS OF BELFASTMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster general  think there are increasing reasons for concern about the future of Shorts,Belfast. This company belongs to neither of the two main aircraft groups whichare our &quot; preferred instruments &quot; for Government aviation orders. It does not forma viable unit within the current shape of the British aircraft industry. Thus, tomaintain employment at Shorts at anything like its present level, it will be necessaryto distort the pattern of Defence production, and place unacceptable additionalburdens on the Defence Budget. This approach to the problem does not seem tome to be in the long-term interests of the company, their workpeople or the NorthernIreland economy, and will give rise to continual friction.2. In my view the answer to the problem of Shorts does not lie in proposalsfor placing orders for aircraft which cannot be fully justified on their merits. Thiswill not in the long run improve the position of the company, and it will leave anunduly large slice of the Northern Ireland economy dependent on a single firm withdubious prospects in an uncertain field.3. I should much prefer a more forward-looking approach, and to find a realanswer to the problem of Shorts by taking bold and imaginative measures whichwould provide alternative employment for the Shorts labour force, and which wouldbe of permanent benefit to the Northern Ireland economy. The rundown of Shortslabour force will not, on present forecasts, present a very serious problem until 1965.If we start now with the sort of action I have in mind, we can make sufficient progressby 1965 to enable us to cope with this rundown.4. I think that the most satisfactory means of providing new employment forthe Shorts workers would be to develop the Shorts site as a trading estate. Thiswould need very substantial assistance from public funds, to which I am in principleprepared to agree.5.   I therefore propose:(a) that we should now decide in principle that, subject to consultation withthe Northern Ireland Government, the Shorts site should be redeveloped,with the necessary Government assistance, as a trading estate, and thatShorts should in due course cease to manufacture aircraft (the firm mightstay in business in a small way as an engineering concern with perhapssome interest in missiles);(b) that discussions be opened with the Northern Ireland Government with aview to working out with them the steps necessary to give effect to thisdecision.J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,18th February, 1963.12115THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
