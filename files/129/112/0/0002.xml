THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. January 1963C. (63) 2 Copy No.      5 28th January, 1963CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE AND OTHER benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceArising from the meeting of the Cabinet on 3rd January (C.C. (63)1st Conclusions, Minute 2) I set out in this memorandum figures comparing thecost and effect on contributions of raising the single rate of national insurance benefits by 7s. 6d. and by 10s. Od. The figures I give are based on the latestcosting work, subject only to minor adjustments.Rates2. I think the married rates should go up under the two plans by 12s. 6d.and 16s. 6d. respectively. The new rates would be 65s. Od. (single) and 105s. Od.(married) in the one case; and 67s. 6d. (single) and 109s. Od. (married) in the other.The figures below make provision, in both cases, for consequential increases inother national insurance and industrial injuries rates and in war pensions.Increase of Expenditure3. The following table summarises the approximate total increase in benefitpayments (including national assistance and war pensions) and in Exchequer costunder the two plans on different assumptions about the accompanying increase in national assistance for single householders:(i)	(ii)	(iii)	(iv)   -National insurance	National assistance	Total increase in	Exchequer Share of increase	increase	benefit payments	column (iii)s.    d.	s.    d.	  million	  million7    6	5    0	169	2910    0	6    0	222	37Contributions4. The changes in the graduated part of the scheme would be the same under either plan. The extra cost of a 10s. Od. increase would be met by a higherincrease in the flat-rate contributions which everybody pays (attracting  8 millionextra from the Exchequer).5. To finance a 7s. 6d. increase, the minimum contribution (i.e., that for anemployed man earning no more than  9 a week, of whom there are now very few)would go up by 9d. each for employer and employee. The new joint contribution(including industrial injuries and the national health service) would be 20s. 8d.(employee^ share .1 Is. 4d.).6. To finance a 10s. Od. increase, the minimum contribution would go up byIs. Id. a side to 21s. 4d. (employee&apos;s share 11s. 8d.).
1. In either case the man earning over  15 a week and not contracted outof the graduated scheme would also pay higher graduated contribution, but wouldearn more graduated pension.8.  The effect on contributions is further illustrated in the Annex.N.
