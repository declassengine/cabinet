REVIEW OF FUTURE AGRICULTURAL POLICYDraft Paragraphs for the White Paper on the Annual Review, 1963Note by the Chairman of the Economic (Steering) CommitteeThe Minister of Agriculture informed the Economic Policy Committee on13th February (E.A. (63) 7th Meeting, Minute 2) that he wanted to point the wayto a future change of agricultural policy in the White Paper on the Annual Review,1963, to be published on 13th March. The attached draft paragraphs for theWhite Paper have been prepared by officials and considered by the EconomicSteering (General) Committee.2. The White Paper has to strike a balance between maintaining freedomof action and allaying the fears of farmers. The farmers, for their part, are unlikely to be satisfied, even for the time being, with anything less than an assurance that the system of guaranteed prices developed under the AgricultureActs will be maintained. But an assurance in these terms would restrict theGovernment^ freedom of action in various ways and might be regarded in europe as an indication that the United Kingdom was not going to pursue a trulyEuropean policy.3. The crux lies in the way in which the Agriculture Acts are referred to.The majority of the Economic Steering Committee preferred the shorter version of paragraph 3 of the attached draft as giving the greater freedom. But theMinistry of Agriculture thought that the minimum formulation which might be acceptable to the National Farmers&apos; Unions would have to include the parts in square brackets. They consider that there would be ample scope for radical changes in the present system of support without overriding the Agriculture Acts.4. The Ministry of Agriculture also disagreed with the rest of the steering committee about referring in the White Paper to the sort of questions which will arise in the Governments further consultations with the unions. The majoritythought that any statement on this point would be either uninformative orprejudicial, and preferred to stop at the end of paragraph 4. The Ministry ofAgriculture thought that a passage such as paragraph 5 would give Ministers aline on which to stand in Parliamentary debates and would also make it easier for them at a later stage to make radical changes in policy, within the scope ofthe Acts, if they so desired; and on the latter point they have proposed alternativedrafts which suggest, (a) changes in the direction of limiting subsidy by referenceto quantities of produce, and (b) changes both in that direction and also towardsshifting the cost of subsidy from the taxpayer to the consumer.(Signed)     W. ARMSTRONG.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,1st March, 1963.
ANNUAL REVIEW, 1963Draft Paragraphs for White paper. The experience of recent years has shown a need for changes in thearrangements for agricultural support, in order(a) to bring under more effective control the cost of agricultural support,whilst maintaining broadly the present balance between home-grown and imported food; and(by to give the producer a greater incentive to get as much as possible of his return from the price at which he markets his produce.2. A start has been made in this year&apos;s Price Review. The changes in theguarantee arrangements for eggs and pigs are described in paragraphs X and Yabove. The Government has also announced its intention to change the deficiency round system for fatstock (see paragraph Z).3. While the fundamental objectives* of the Agriculture Acts and the general principle[s] of support [developed under those Acts] will be preserved, there willhave to be further changes in the system.4. Consultations with the unions will now go forward on measures designedto achieve the aims set out above. These measures must take account of thepossibilities of making arrangements for the import of agricultural products whichwould be fair alike to producers and consumers and to exporting and importing countries, through such means as international commodity agreements.Additional paragraph suggested by the Agricultural Departments[5. It will be necessary to consider whether more should be done in the context of our general trading policies to prevent domestic market prices from being undermined. It will also be necessary to examine [the possibilities of relatingthe cost of agricultural support more directly to production that is nor in excessof what it is in the national interest to produce at home.] [whether it is practicable and desirable to control the liability of the Exchequer by transferring in some part to the consumer the cost of agricultural support, and by relating that support more directly to production that is not in excess of what it is in the national interest toproduce at home.]]* These objectives are: To promote and maintain a stable and efficient agricultural industrycapable of producing such part of the nation&apos;s food and agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom and of producing it at minimum pricesconsistently with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agricultureand an adequate return on capital invested in the industry.
