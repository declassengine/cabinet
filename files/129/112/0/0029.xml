Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1963C. (63) 29 Copy No.     5226th February, 1963CABINETFINANCING OF UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING OPERATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe BackgroundAt its Sixteenth Session last December, the General Assembly formallyendorsed the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice that united nations costs in the Middle East and the Congo were &quot; expenses of theOrganisation &quot;. The effect of this was to affirm the obligation of members topay their share of these costs as assessed by the General Assembly and theirliability to lose their vote if their total arrears (including arrears on these costs)exceeded two years&apos; subscriptions as provided for in Article 19 of the Charter.2. The endorsing resolution was adopted by a large majority, even thoughnearly 70 members had at that time paid nothing at all towards the cost of one or both the operations. The majority was obtained mainly because the sponsors ofthe endorsing resolution (including the United Kingdom) had agreed to supportanother resolution appointing a Working Group of 17 to study the question of financing peace-keeping operations and payment of arrears, and to report to aSpecial Session of the General Assembly to be called not later than the end ofJune 1963. It was tacitly understood that the purpose of this latter resolution wasto ensure that future peace-keeping costs were apportioned fairly bearing verylightly on the poorer countries and thus minimising the chances that they wouldbecome vulnerable to the penalty provided for in Article 19.3. The Working Group began its meetings in New York at the end ofJanuary and is required to produce its report by 31st March. It is now in recessin order to allow time for informal exchanges of view; but it will resume on 4th March and it is likely that by then opinion on the kind of recommendation tobe made to the Special Session will have crystallised around one or two ideas.4. It is already clear that there is much common ground among the membersof the Working Group. Apart from the French and the Soviet bloc representatives,who are of course the principal defaulters, there is widespread feeling thatassessments for 1963 and future years should, as in the past, be compulsoryand should be apportioned, not on the scale of assessments used for the regularbudget, but on a special scale designed to spare the needy.5. It is on this point of the criteria to be taken into account in fixing thespecial scale for any future operation that differences of opinion have been expressed so far. There is also a certain division between the United States, whowould like the Working Group to confine its recommendations to the financing of current operations in 1963, and others, such as Canada and the representativesof the poorer countries, who want to see a procedure laid down for coveringpeace-keeping costs in future years.6. The United Kingdom representative has confined himself to generalitiesso far and we are therefore not committed to the advocacy of any particular course of action. He has, however, been instructed to seek, without commitment,the reaction of the United States and other friendly delegations to certain ideas.It is on these that I now wish to inform my colleagues and invite their comments.2145
Financing in 1963:    &apos; xu?       ;       ,7. It is going to be very difficult to avoid compulsory assessments on a specialscale to pay for the Middle East (U.N.E.F.) and Congo (0,N.U.C.) operations in1963. The only conceivable way of doing so would be to commit ourselves to asystem involving large voluntary contributions from ourselves as well as others.Even if practicable, which is very doubtful in the United Nations context, I assume that this would be politically undesirable. There would be strong oppositionhere to any suggestion that we should buy more bonds and this would be truein the United States if Congress were asked to approve a second purchase abovethe $100 million already authorised. Up till now, the arrears which have brought the Organisation close to financial collapse are those of the so-called politicaldefaulters: the Soviet bloc and France, who are assessed to pay 27 per cent onthe regular scale.8. There is no evidence so far that these countries will be persuaded by theInternational Court of Justice (I.C.J.) opinion to pay either their past assessmentsor their assessment for 1963. Indeed, the French have informed the Secretary-General that they will even withhold from their subscription to the regular budgeta sum corresponding to their share of the annual repayment and servicing costs of the bonds, on the ground that these were an indirect and improper means of paying for the Congo operation. As they will not pay, at least this percentageof any further compulsory levy (and more if a special scale of assessment is used)will remain unpaid and the United Nations deficit will be increased accordingly.In these circumstances and in the light of our misgivings about the O.N.U.C.operation, it is tempting to say that, as from now, if others do not pay, we willnot pay either. To do so would, I think, be a tactical error, at any rate for thisyear. By joining the defaulters now we should be acting in a way directly contraryto our vote on the I.C.J. ruling and we should be impaling ourselves on the hookwe have helped to prepare for the Russians and those who follow their example.Unless they pay up the Russians will lose their vote in 1964. When that happenswe shall be on the best ground to refuse to continue payments. While, if as Isuspect a majority in the United Nations tries to allow the Russians to vote inspite of their default, we could question the desirability of continuing membership of an organisation which was so conducted. We would then have a lot of support.9. My conclusion is that as we cannot breach an obligation which we havelately affirmed, we shall have to pay compulsory assessments, and we might aswell pay with good grace the $4^ million which will be our share of U.N.E.F.and O.N.U.C. costs. Feelings about the conduct of the Congo operation are stillstrong, but I think we can justify our decision on the grounds that U Thant isturning over from a military to a civil programme, and that our agreement issolely in respect of 1963, pending a satisfactory arrangement for future years andfuture police operations.Long-term Arrangements10.   The broad alternatives seem to be:(i) A general peace-keeping fund to be built up by annual compulsoryassessments additional to normal subscriptions.This has its attractions, and at one time was favoured by the americans. But it might result in too much power accumulating inthe hands of the Secretary-General and tempt an Afro-Asian majorityto make occasions to use it. It might involve us in automatic financial support of operations of which we disapproved. And, even supposing that these difficulties could be met, there is little reason to suppose thatthe Russians or French would pay up additional annual subscriptionsto such a general fund.(ii) A system of wholly voluntary contributionsThe disadvantages of this are obvious. It would conflict with theprinciple of collective responsibility of United Nations members, and let the Soviet bloc and the French off the hook completely. If sufficientfunds were made available in any particular case, Western contributorswould probably be accused of buying the United Nations.
(iii) A part-compulsory, part-voluntary systemAn effective solution must include some compulsory element. Ifthis is too large, there would be no hope at all of Soviet or french -operation, and the result would again be a substantial shortfall inreceipts. The voluntary element must therefore be considerable. Thishas the advantage of enabling us to refuse support for operations whichwe disapprove but cannot effectively veto. The procedure would be something like this. The Security Council, or the General assembly on the advice of the Secretary-General, would estimate the cost of a given operation for the year ahead. We would pay a percentage. Wewould accept the obligation to provide a percentage related to thepercentage of our general assessment and adjusted to take acount ofability to pay. This we would be obliged to subscribe but everythingover that would be &quot; voluntary &quot;.11. I therefore seek the consent of my colleagues to instruct our representative on the Working Group that it should continue to explore with the American andother delegations in New York the possibilities of finding on this basis a long-termscheme on which the major Powers could agree. It is clear that the problem isa thorny one and the answer will not be easy to find; but, in view of the financialcrises that peace-keeping operations have caused in the past and may again causein the future, I think it important that we make all possible use of the opportunityprovided by the meetings of the Working Group and the Special Session of theGeneral Assembly to devise a method of financing more acceptable and more efficient than anything tried so far.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,25th February, 1963.
