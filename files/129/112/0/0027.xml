[THIS DOCUMENT is THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)c^cmut. COPY NO. ^5225th February, 1963.CABINETORGANISATION FOR.DEFENCENoJ^by^the Prime MinisterSince the end of the war, we have been moving gradually towards amore centralised direction of higher defence policy, in terms of the form-ulation of strategy, the control of operations and the allocation of resources.    The arrangements described in the poet-war Y/hite papers on the &quot;Central Organisation for Defence&quot; have achieved a good deal inthis respect.     But they have not gone to the root of the matter.    L feel sure that, by maintaining a basic form of organisation which is not sufficiently flexible to adapt itself to the current needs of defence policy,we are missing successive opportunities to increase both the efficiency of our Forces and the economy of their administration.After discussion with the Minister of Defence, I invited him tore-examine this problem of central organisation, with the help of suchindependent and professional advice as he might see fit to take.    during his enquiry he commissioned General Lord Ismay and Lieutenant-general sir Ian Jacob to prepare for him a study of the main issues involved.    Acopy of their findings is attached to this Note.I have been re-assured to find that two individuals, who speak with the authority derived from a long and intimate experience of theworking of the central machinery for the direction of defence policy,have reached conclusions which are very similar to our own estimate ofwhat is needed.     The choices which they offer us are for discussion;and, in certain respects - e.g. the question of uniform - we should bewell advised, I think, not to depart too radically from tradition.    But,on the main issue of our machinery for framing and executing our defencepolicies, I hope that the Cabinet will endorse in principle my own viewthat the time is now ripe for a further and substantial advance in thedirection which the Ismay/jacob report suggests.H.M.Admiralty House, S, W. 1.25th February, 1963.
CONFIDENTIAL \THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 government copy No.78HIGHER DIRECTION OF DEFENCEReport by General Lord Ismay and Lieutenant-General Sir Ian JacobMinister of defence in accordance with the request that you made to us early last month, wesubmit herewith the results of our study of the central organisation for Defence.We have taken as our starting point the Prime Minister^ Minute No. M 330/62of 9th December, 1962, but we thought it right to range further afield and to try to present as far as possible a complete review of the essentials of defence organisation.2. In Part I of our study, we invite attention to what we believe to be serious shortcomings in the machinery for the higher direction of defence policy,and we make recommendations as to how the position could be improved. Themeasures which we propose are of a purely domestic character, and would costlittle or nothing: they might indeed at first sight seem almost trivial. But we are convinced that their adoption would do much to dispel the discord, uncertainty and malaise which undoubtedly exist at the present time.3. The second part of our study deals with the question of reorganising themachinery by which the Cabinefs defence policy is put into effect at presentrepresented by the Ministry of Defence, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and ministry of Aviation.4. Broadly speaking there are three choices which we have set out in sections A, B and C of Part II of our Report:A. To adjust the existing system, leaving its basic outline unchanged.B. To extend the Ministry of Defence to include as subordinate departments the three Service Ministries, the latter to be radically changed by ageographical redistribution.   The three Services to remain intact.C. To achieve a completely integrated, functionally organised, Ministry ofDefence, with the three Services retaining their identity in units andformations while being fused together in their higher organisation.5. We do not recommend choice A, which we believe to be inadequate topresent needs and to the developing climate of opinion.6. We recommend choice B, not only because of its intrinsic merits but because it is a considerable and logical step towards choice C, which we regard asthe inevitable aim. Indeed we would suggest that if Her Majesty&apos;s government decided to adopt choice B, they would be well advised to announce that they were doing so with a view to the eventual attainment of choice C.7. In the time available we have not been able to go into more than theessential outlines of reorganisation. After a decision in principle has been made,a good deal of careful planning will be necessary to ensure that the schemeadopted is executed with close attention to detail. We feel confident, however,that no insuperable difficulties will be found to vitiate our proposals or to prevent them being fulfilled.(Signed)ISMAY.IAN JACOB.20th February, 1963.
PART ITHE HIGHER DIRECTION OF defence. The responsibilities of the Cabinet in regard to Defence are never-ending.Perhaps the most important and certainly the most complicated of these is to decide the overall defence policy which is to govern the size, character, equipment anddisposition of our armed forces. Having made their decision they must keep theirpolicy under constant review and make such adjustments as changes in the situation may render necessary. And all the time they must ensure that, at every stage, policyand action are kept in step the one with the other. In addition to the long term policy the Cabinet has to be prepared to deal at a momenfs notice with unexpectedproblems that suddenly flare up in remote parts of the world such as the recentemergencies at Kuwait and Brunei.2. The difficulties which confront the Cabinet in discharging these responsibilities are aggravated by the multiplicity of interests which have to be takeninto account. As a general rule, defence problems whether in the long or short termcannot be resolved on military advice alone: there are many other voices whichmust be heard, particularly those of the Foreign Office and Treasury. This being so it is essential that there should be some central and independent mechanism towhich all the strategic, political and economic considerations which have a bearing on the problem can be marshalled, examined, and brought into focus the one withthe other.  Only thus can properly balanced solutions be reached.3. We trust that we shall not be thought to be harking back to the bow-and-arrow era instead of looking forward into the space age when we suggest that thereare useful lessons to be drawn from the experiences of the Committee of ImperialDefence. Only a few of its features need be mentioned.4. The Committee was set up nearly 60 years ago because there were &quot; nomeans for co-ordinating defence problems or for dealing with them as a whole &quot;;and because machinery was required which could obtain and co-ordinate &quot; for theuse of the Cabinet all the information and expert advice required for the shaping ofNational policy in war and for determining the necessary preparations in peace &quot;.5. The Prime Minister was &quot; invariably President&quot; and had &quot; absolutediscretion in the selection or variation of its members &quot;. In practice the PrimeMinister of the day used to nominate a panel of Ministers and Officials who receivedall papers, and attended all meetings at which subjects with which they were concerned were to be discussed. The Committee held regular meetings once a week.6. The Committee worked through a system of sub-committees of which therewere a very large number. Some of these were standing: some ad hoc. Some wereministerial: some official. Some were partly ministerial and partly official; therewas no fixed rule. The only purely military committees were the Chiefs of staff committee, which was set up in 1923, and its offspring the Deputy Chiefs of Staff,the Joint Planning and the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committees. It may be useful togive examples of the kind of sub-committees which were set up from time to time todeal with long-term and short-term problems.7. In 1933 the Chiefs of Staff in their Annual Report to the C.I.D. drew attention to the parlous state of our defences, and a high power officialsub-committee called the Defence Requirements Committee was set up to examinethe whole position and make recommendations to the Cabinet. It had the Secretaryto the Cabinet in the Chair and the members were the Head of the Treasury, thePermanent Under-Secretary to the Foreign Office and the three Chiefs of Staff.8. In the 1920s Iraq was a Mandate, and there were spasmodic troubles there.These concerned not only the Colonial Office, and the Air Ministry who had assumed military responsibility for the country, but also the Foreign Office by virtueof their interests in Palestine and Egypt, the Indian Office by virtue of their interestsin the Persian Gulf, and the War Office in view of the possibility of the need forreinforcements. The C.I.D. therefore set up two Middle East Sub-Committees, theone ministerial, the other official. The former were convened only for problems ofgreat importance. It is to be noted that although many of these enquiries culminatedin the issue of orders for military action, the Chiefs of Staff Committee, as such, was never used as the forum for discussion.
9. The Committee of Imperial Defence had a small permanent Secretariat,entirely independent of all Departments and directly responsible to the PrimeMinister. It was located in the same building as the Cabinet Secretariat with whom they worked hand in glove, and the Secretary of the Cabinet was the recognisedHead of the office. Lord Balfour described the C.I.D. Secretariat as &quot; the keystoneof the whole edifice &quot;; and he may not have been far wrong. In any case it isnoteworthy that the two similar National Defence Committees which were set uptowards the latter part of the 19th century, without permanent secretariats,withered away.10. The keystone of the Committee of Imperial Defence was flexibility andelasticity. It could bring into consultation the best brains in the country wherever they might be, industrialists, scientists, members of the Opposition (either from thefront or back benches), Ambassadors, retired officers of the fighting services andso forth. When in 1929 the Committee of Imperial Defence discussed the questionof a channel tunnel, there sat round the same table one Prime Minister and threeex-Prime Ministers, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald in the Chair together with lord balfour, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lloyd George.11. It is, of course, true that the Committee of Imperial Defence was advisoryand consultative. But no Cabinet was likely to disregard advice that came from a body which had the Prime Minister as Chairman, and many of the principalMinisters of the Crown as members. Thus it had a distinct entity of its own, andan authority that was recognised throughout Whitehall, and the BritishCommonwealth.12. On the outbreak of the Second World War the Committee of ImperialDefence went into suspense, and the supreme control was vested in the WarCabinet in accordance with preconcerted arrangements made by the C.I.D. Onthe conclusion of hostilities it was decided (see Cmd. 6923 of October 1946) thatthe Committee of Imperial Defence should not be restored in its original form,as had been done after the First World War, but that there should be a new post of Minister of Defence and a new Department called the Ministry of Defence.At the same time it was categorically laid down that there should be a DefenceCommittee which would &quot; take over the functions of the old Committee ofImperial Defence &quot;. It was also emphasised that the Prime Minister must &quot; retain the supreme responsibility for defence &quot; and that the Minister of Defence shouldhave two distinct entities, the first as Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee;the second as overlord, so to speak, of the three Service Departments.13. The writers of this Report both took a hand in drafting the White Paperquoted in the preceding paragraph, and we had every expectation that not only would the Committee of Imperial Defence continue in a new form and under anew name, but also that its well tried techniques would be preserved. Ourexpectations have not been fulfilled and the situation is likely to deteriorate unlesspositive action is taken.14. It is of course true that the Prime Minister has continued to be Chairmanof the Defence Committee, and that less than five years ago he nominated the panel of regular attendants (cmnd.. 476 of July 1958). It is also true that thereare a large number of sub-committees engaged in the co-operation of departmental action in the event of war. On the other hand the Defence Committee has norecognised permanent Secretariat such as served the Committee of ImperialDefence: it does not hold regular meetings: it has not, so far as we have been ableto ascertain, made a practice of bringing into consultation the best brains of thecountry wherever they are to be found: and we are doubtful whether the C.I.D.technique of having specific problems hammered out by sub-committees of appropriate composition has been copied to any great extent.15. But the greatest handicap under which the Defence Committee laboursin these days is that it is not being entrusted with the work that it was set upto perform.   Cmd. 6923 of October 1946 reads as follows:&quot;21. The appointment of a Minister of Defence will relieve the PrimeMinister of that part of his general responsibility for national defence whichis concerned with the inter-relation of the three fighting Services and their supply. There remains, however, the organisation for national defence inits broader aspect, etc.&quot;
16. It is therefore clear that it was intended that only the purely militarycommittees, such as the Chiefs of Staff and its offspring, should be under the aegis of the Ministry of Defence, and that only those problems which could be decided on military considerations alone should be taken by the Ministry of Defence.Whenever Foreign Office or Commonwealth Relations Office or Colonial Officeinterests had to be taken into account, the problem was to be collectively discussed in the Defence Committee and its subordinate committees, as &quot; the sole authorityfor co-ordinating all departmental action in the sphere of Defence &quot;.17. We find however, that there has grown up a tendency for all matters with a predominantly military flavour to be discussed and settled in the Ministryof Defence. Perhaps this is due to the increased authority that has been grantedfrom time to time to the Minister of Defence and in particular to a misunderstanding of Part III of Cmnd. 476 of July 1958; perhaps it is due to the propinquity of hisMinistry to the Cabinet Office; perhaps it is due to a failure to recognise thatthe Minister of Defence has two entirely separate identities, and that his responsibilities as Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee (for whose meetingshe should be briefed by the Secretary of that Committee) are distinct from his responsibilities as Minister of Defence. Be that as it may we are assured thatthe Chiefs of Staff have more and more become a forum into which all sorts of problems, some of which have a considerable political content, are thrown. Forexample the Brunei problem which is highly political, and affects both theCommonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office, has been handled underthe aegis of the Chiefs of Staff.  This is obviously wrong.18. The Prime Ministers Personal Minute No. M 330/62 of 9th December,1962, speaks of reforms to &quot; expedite decisions on major strategy &quot;, and &quot; simplify the machinery in London for the higher direction of operations&quot;. We are confident that very considerable improvements can be made in both directionsby reviving and slightly reinforcing the structure of the Defence Committee. Andwe would emphasise that immediate effect can be given to our proposals, irrespective of any changes that may be made in the Ministry of Defence and the service departments.19.   Our recommendations are as follows:(a) All Departments should be reminded that all Defence problems, except those which are based on purely military considerations, should bereferred to the only recognised co-ordinating authority namely theDefence Committee or to subordinate committees set up by theDefence Committee.(b) Attendance at Defence Committee meetings should not be absolutelyconfined to those mentioned in paragraph 4 of Cmnd. 476 of July 1958.Other officials such as the Chief Scientific Adviser, Ministry of Defence,might be invited by the Prime Minister to attend as required.(c) In view of the exceptional complexities of the defence situation, which are brought about by the breakneck speed of the advance of science, thesometimes unexpected behaviour of allies, and so forth, there shouldbe established a high-power Defence Policy (Official) Committee,composed as follows:The Secretary to the Cabinet (Chairman)The P.U.S. of the Foreign office the Permanent Secretary of the treasury the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of defence the Chief of Defence staff the Chief Scientific Adviser, Ministry of defence the terms of reference should be to frame an overall Defence policy for consideration by the Defence Committee and thereafter to keep it under continuous review.(d) It should be recognised that the Minister of Defence has two distinctresponsibilities. On the one hand he is Deputy Chairman of the DefenceCommittee, and acts for the Prime Minister as necessary. In this capacity he is briefed by the Secretary of the Defence Committee.On the other hand he is the Minister of the principal military department and is briefed by his own departmental officers.
(e) There should be a small permanent Secretariat with a military officer of major-General or equivalent rank at its head. This officer would havedirect access to the Prime Minister. The Secretariat would be partlymilitary and partly civil and would be part of the Cabinet Secretariat.(/) The Defence Committee should meet regularly.PART IITHE MILITARY ORGANISATION20. The organisation we are here concerned with is comprised within theMinistry of Defence, the three Service Departments, and the Ministry of Aviation.The only organism which falls outside these Departments is the Joint IntelligenceCommittee which is based on the Cabinet Office.21. We have been at pains to discover the defects in the present organisation which have given rise to the feeling that changes should be made. The first,almost universal, complaint is that the present system does not produce for the guidance of all concerned a consistent overall defence policy. It is a criticism which should not be made of the Ministry of Defence and its military machine,but of the arrangement for the higher direction of defence, on which we havemade recommendations in Part I of our Report. Beyond this, we have foundnearly everywhere a general malaise, the symptoms of which have varied to someextent in the Ministry of Defence on the one hand and in the Service departments on the other.22. We have heard from people in the Ministry of Defence three maincriticisms of the present state of affairs. They are:(a) The Ministry of Defence does not have sufficient control to enable theDefence Budget to be a real synthesis rather than a proportionalcarve-up of the cake.(b) At a time when money and resources are severely limited, and costs are constantly rising, narrow Service interests prevent in nearly everyfield the formation of an effective central policy based on the objectiveexamination of the facts.(c) The Defence Research and Development programme cannot, under thepresent system, be effectively devised and controlled.23. The lack of confidence in the present system which is apparent in theService Departments is less easy to define. It can be expressed in general terms as a doubt whether the Ministry of Defence is properly set up to carry out itstasks efficiently.24. Apart from the general propositions contained in the Prime Minister^Minute, and the plan put forward in his Paper by the Chief of Defence Staff, wehave received a number of other suggestions for improving the machinery in whole or part. A number of experienced people, however, have told us that it isnot so much a drastic reform of machinery that is required as that the existing machinery should be more efficiently exploited. They point to the fact that theMinister of Defence already has ample powers, and although certain improvements in different parts of the present organisation would be desirable, they considerthe basic organisation should remain unchanged. We have thought it rightourselves to take this point of view into account, and we have accordingly setdown in this Report three possible organisations:(a) An adjustment of the existing system, leaving its basic outline unchanged;(b) An extension of the Ministry of Defence to embrace the service departments;(c) A single Ministry and fully integrated Services.We have had to deal somewhat separately with the special problem of research,development and production of aircraft, guided missiles, electronics, etc.25. Before going further, we would like to emphasise the extreme difficulty and complexity of the problems that have to be solved by the defence organisation.It is highly improbable that any revised system will ensure more than partialsuccess in solving them.  It is all the more important, therefore, to be sure that
the present dissatisfaction is attributed to the right causes, and that changes in organisation shall only be made if a real improvement can be confidently expected from them.A.-Adjustments to the Existing Organisation26.  The tasks that the military organisation has to perform are as follows:(1) The preparation of military appreciations and plans.(2) The formulation of military advice as a contribution to the framing ofthe Governments overall defence policy.(3) The conduct of military operations.(4) The framing of the military budget.(5) The direction of research development and production of weapon systems and equipment.(6) The administration of the Services.27. Under the system brought into effect by Cmnd. 476 of July 1958, theMinister of Defence has complete authority on all the above matters except (6),where responsibility rests on the Service Ministers and the respective Service board or Councils. The Minister of Defence has no authority, however, over theexecution of the programme of research development and production which comes within the responsibilities of the Minister of Aviation.28. The Minister of Defence has a staff partly military and partly civil,operating under his three principal advisers, namely the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, the Chief of Defence Staff, and the Chief Scientific Adviser.This staff operates largely on the long-established method of bringing together the responsible people from each Department concerned, and with their assistance,working out matters for decision by the Minister. An important principle of thepresent system is that as far as possible the Minister of Defence and his seniorstaff should concentrate on the framing of policy, leaving the tasks of management and administration to the other Departments. This is a very important point, wellrecognised in large industries, and it would be unwise to make changes whichwould load on to the Minister of Defence any management functions which canbe decentralised. If the present system is to be preserved, we would not suggest any change in the responsibilities of the Minister of Defence.29. The first question to be considered in the existing organisation is theposition of the Chief of Defence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff together with the subordinate joint staffs who work for them in the Ministry of Defence. It is thesewho are responsible for the first three tasks mentioned in paragraph 26 above.The Chief of Defence Staff occupies a post created in 1958 with duties set outin Cmnd. 476 of that year. He is the principal military adviser of the Ministerof Defence. He is chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The White Paperfurther states:&quot; The agreed collective advice of the Chiefs of Staff Committee will betendered to the Minister of Defence by the Chief of the Defence Staff. Whereit is not possible for him to tender agreed collective advice, he will reportto the Minister the views of the other members of the Chiefs of staff committee and will be responsible, as the principal military adviser of theMinister, for tendering his own advice to the Minister in the light of thoseviews.&quot;For many years and all through the war the Minister of Defence was served bya Chief Staff Officer who was a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, though not chairman. There are a number of experienced. people who would like to revert to the old system. They feel that there were positive advantages in thefact that the Chief Staff Officer to the Minister of Defence was not chairman ofthe Committee and did nothing to detract from the collective importance and authority of the three Chiefs of Staff. The Chief Staff Officer was not the military adviser of the Minister. The Chiefs of Staff themselves were that. Thus the time-honoured principle that advice should only be given by those holding the full responsibility for their Services was observed. The creation of the post of a Chiefof Defence Staff, who is to some extent empowered to give advice independently of the Committee, runs counter to the principle and to some extent depresses thestanding and authority of the three Chiefs of Staff.
30. We do not lightly brush aside these opinions, which have a good deal-of weight. But we consider it only logical that the system of having a unifiedcommander in charge of all three Services in overseas theatres should be reflected in our organisation at home, and we consider that to abolish the appointment ofC.D.S. would be a retrograde step. Apart from his duties as Chairman of theChiefs of Staff Committee, he is the focal point in the conduct of operations, andthe authority responsible for issuing orders to commanders overseas. He is also available to represent the Government on all the allied military committees and conferences that are held from time to time.31. The selection of the right man for the job is a matter of great importance.It is not a post that should be filled by rotation between the Services, or on theprinciple of &quot; Buggins&apos; turn &quot;.32. In his paper the Chief of Defence Staff expresses dissatisfaction withthe working of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and attributes the difficulty to the inevitable Service loyalty of each Chief of Staff. On many important issues he feels that the opposing viewpoints expressed in the Committee make it impossiblefor objective military advice to be rendered to the Minister. His proposedsolution is a drastic one, involving the disappearance of the C.O.S. Committee as now known. We do not support his recommendation, and consider that so longas there are three Services it is essential that the CCS. Committee should remain,and that each Chief of Staff should in the last resort have access to the Ministerand to the Prime Minister as laid down in Cmnd. 476 of 1958.33. We would observe here that disagreement and strong controversy inthe Chiefs of Staff Committee is nothing new. There were many issues in the last40 years which divided the Chiefs of Staff as deeply, if not more deeply, thanthose with which they are now struggling. On many matters agreement caneventually be reached within the Committee and collective advice tendered. Theimportant point in our view is that when issues of first-class importance arise and a sincerely held difference of view appears, the alternatives, after full discussionleading to a clear definition of their nature and implications, should be brought up to the Defence Committee for decision by Ministers.34. Two further changes would, we believe, ease matters considerably.The first arises from Part I of our Report. There should be a considerable reduction in the present diverse load of business that reaches the agenda&apos; of theChiefs of Staff if the Defence Committee as originally conceived is revived and functions on the lines explained in Part I of this Report.35. It is difficult for us in the time available to examine in detail theorganisation of the Ministry of Defence. Nevertheless, we have the strongimpression that there should be an amalgamation and a streamlining of the Chiefsof Staff Secretariat and CD.S.&apos;s staff. The important thing is that the wholeof the Chiefs of Staff Committee, including C.D.S., should be working on thesame information, should be served centrally by the same staff and should not beregarded as separate authorities.36. We have no comments to make on the present Joint Planning Staffsystem. We would urge, however, that if there is to be no change in the basicstructure of defence organisation, there should be nevertheless a spreading ofthe principle of joint staff working into military fields where it does not yet exist.There should also be a strengthening of the operational team recently established in the Ministry of Defence, so that control of the many minor operations thatbecome necessary in different parts of the world can be more speedy and efficient.37. We now turn to the civil side of the Ministry of Defence, and to thefourth task mentioned in paragraph 26, viz. the framing of the military budget.A good system seems to have been worked out for the annual forecasting ofexpenditure. In outline, this is that early in the calendar year defence policyis reviewed and adjusted. This process is followed by an examination of the costs of the resultant Service programmes. An attempt is made to compile a firmestimate for the following financial year, and then to forecast with less precisionthe likely costs in the subsequent four years. The results of this examination arethen looked at, any necessary adjustments are made, and a defence budget targetarrived at for the following year and five years ahead.
38. This system does not work as well as it should. There is the initialdifficulty over the Governments defence policy which we have already dealt with;there is the continual failure on the part of the Ministry of Aviation to provideapproximately correct figures for the major programmes of development, with consequent alarming distortions of the budget; and there is the difficultyexperienced by the Ministry of Defence in successfully synthesising the budgets ofthe three Services and arriving at a firm ceiling based on realistic figures. It isthe latter point with which we are here immediately concerned. The difficulty is this. Each Service Department naturally tends to submit an estimate which itcan justify but which contains an element of fat, which can be sacrificed whenthe squeeze comes. The Ministry of Defence find it difficult to get beneath the surface here and do more than add the three estimates together and then cutthem proportionately if the total is too big. Nobody feels very happy about this system. It is suggested by some that the staff of the Ministry is not strong enough. This may well be so, but it is not possible for us to form an opinionon the question. We would merely say that it is of great importance that theMinister of Defence should use his powers to satisfy himself, and that perhaps atougher attitude is called for. The situation would be considerably helped webelieve if there were a greater interchange of civil servants between the service departments and the Ministry of Defence.39. Coming on to the fifth task, the direction of the research and development programme, there are grave misgivings about the present situation. this programme, directed to the production of new weapons for the Services, takeson increasing importance with the advance of defence technology. It requiresincreasingly a long-term view of military weapons requirements, for a decade oreven two decades ahead. And because of the technical uncertainties, the costof projects making up the programme is specially hard to predict, even a short time ahead.40. These features will inevitably present difficult problems of planning andcontrol under any form of organisation. But a number of criticisms of the presentsystem have been put to us, of a kind which organisational changes might do something to improve:(i) The R. and D. programme is not at present directed to any deliberatelyconceived pattern of military objectives.(ii) There is no satisfactory relationship between the R. and D. and production programme and the resources likely to be available for it or for thedefence programme as a whole, with&apos; the result that there are periodiccrises, cuts in production orders, and wasteful cancellations.(iii) The passage of information from where the work is done to the central policy-forming machine takes too long so that there is a danger ofpolicy being based on out of date financial and technical information.(iv) The present size and shape of the aircraft industry play too dominant apart in decisions on military requirements in its field, and tend toinflate the cost of development.(v) Operational requirements are formulated separately by the three Servicestaffs to meet their own needs, and then either are not reconciled, sothat the programme is overloaded with overlapping development projects, or are reconciled only at a late stage and with muchunnecessary effort.(vi) Operational requirements frequently aim so high, to the extreme limit of theoretical feasibility, that estimates of development cost are seriouslyunreliable, and the equipment is finally produced too late, and at too great a unit cost, to meet the original Service need in full, or to find the overseas markets necessary for an economic production run.41. We believe that the reorganisation of the Defence Committee machineryproposed in Part I, and in particular the Defence Policy (Official) Committee, will help substantially to meet the first two criticisms, by enabling firm strategicobjectives to be worked out for at least a decade ahead, and ensuring that thetotality of these objectives, when translated into a force pattern or into resources,is within the financial limit which the Government accepts as reasonable. Wefully recognise that this will not make the path entirely smooth weaponrequirements cannot always be deduced logically from strategic objectives, and
in any case political and technical changes may occur to alter the requirements;also costs may be found to have risen above the accepted level of resources. Butonce a framework is established, it should be easier to keep the programme underreview and reach clear decisions in the light of changing circumstances.42. A considerable strengthening of the apparatus within the Ministry ofDefence, under its Scientific Adviser, is undoubtedly called for. There must be a concentration here of staff as follows:(a) To enable the Defence Research Policy Committee (which might well berenamed the Defence Research and Development Committee) to operate effectively, there must be an adequate staff in the Ministry to serve it.(b) The formulation of operational requirements is a process of vital importanceto the programme of development. At present waste of effort and resources results from the fact that each Service tends to begin the formulation of operational requirements separately. The operational requirements staffs should be brought together to work in the Ministryof Defence on the same general system as that which has been built upin the Joint Planning Staffs.(c) The study of problems centred on the future of war should be continuouslyundertaken. A Defence Forward Studies Staff should be created, andthe Operational Research Staffs of the three Services should be brought together to work closely with it.(d) A Weapons Systems Evaluation Staff should be created. This Staff wouldprovide evidence on the relative cost / effectiveness of weapons systems.43. The detailed organisation will require to be worked out carefully to ensurethat the composition and placing of the staff here outlined will be effective for thepurpose envisaged. There will no doubt have to be a mixture of staff posted to theMinistry of Defence, and of staff drawn in to work from the three Services andfrom the Ministry of Aviation.&apos;44. In the Ministry of Defence all these aspects of the military programmecome within the responsibility of the Chief Scientific Adviser, and his duties willbe considerably expanded by these suggested additions. The question arises whetherit is the proper function of the Scientific Adviser to perform these duties. We donot subscribe to the view that scientists are inherently incapable of administration,but as in .other walks of life one may find that it is a misuse of high calibrespecialists to burden them with a wide field of duties which includes, as here, thedirection of a partly specialised and partly military staff, and the drawing up ofoverall control of a large development programme, with considerable financial responsibility. It has been suggested by some that the Chairman of the defence research and Development Committee should be a top rank Civil Servant or military man or an outside man experienced in engineering management, and thatthe Chief Scientific Adviser should work closely with him while remaining free tokeep in touch with his scientific colleagues in the world outside and with the work being done in his research establishments. Under such an arrangement, the C.S.A.could take the chair of a Research Sub-Committee, for which task first class scientifictraining is an essential qualification.45. We do not make any recommendation on this point because we believethat the arrangement appropriate at any time must largely depend upon the men available, and their aptitudes. The scientists of the requisite attainment for the job of C.S.A. may be quite at sea in a large executive job. Others may be wellsuited for it. It is for the Government, we suggest, to review the position when a new holder of the post of C.S.A. is to be appointed, and to decide.46. The final problem in this field is that of the Ministry of Aviation itself.We are much struck by the extreme dissatisfaction, expressed on all sides of thedefence organisation, with the present arrangements. We intend to deal later inthis report with the question of whether the Ministry of Aviation should exist atall, but here, where we are assuming merely adjustments in the present situation,the point that has struck us particularly is the complete absence of any representationof the Ministry of Defence on the Research and Development Board of the Ministryof Aviation. The figures we have been given indicate that, leaving out of account the work done by the Ministry of Aviation in connection with airports and groundinstallations of that nature, three-quarters of the expenditure of the Ministry of
Aviation falls within the defence budget. There should clearly be strongrepresentation from the Ministry of Defence on the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s research and Development Board, and we do not think the proposal in the Minister of aviation&apos;s paper of 20th December goes far enough. The representatives shouldbe in every respect full members of this Board so that they can ensure that in all matters under consideration the preponderance of military influence should bebrought to bear.B. An Extension of the Ministry of Defence47. So far, we have suggested a number of measures which would, we believe,considerably improve the situation if it should be decided to leave the basic structureunchanged. We have, however, worked out the main lines of a more radicalreorganisation which we believe would not only be more effective but would pavethe way to what we regard as the inevitable final shape which the defence machinerywill assume. In doing so, we have not only taken into account the views of a largenumber of men working inside and outside the existing machine, but we have looked to see whether anything could be learned from the system which has been developedsince the war in the United States.48. The reorganisation that we have worked out here can be briefly described as the creation of a single Ministry of Defence, having subordinate Departments,Navy, Army and Air. An essential feature of the plan is that the three Servicescontinue to exist intact. In this plan we reject the idea of functional organisation as suggested by C.D.S. in his paper, but we lay strong emphasis upon a geographicalredistribution of the total Defence Headquarters.  Our reasons will appear shortly.49. We would like here to make a general observation. In our view there aretwo separate functions that any large organisation has to perform. The first is themaking of policy and the overall planning of future development. The second isthe management of those organisations through which the policy is executed. Anyreorganisation must ensure that these functions are distinguished and separated.Those responsible for the second must certainly participate in the first, but the detail,inseparable from the second, must not impede the creation of the policy. In any large group of companies it will be found that the central organisation, which hasoverall control, does not, as a rule, interfere in, or concern itself with the detail of,the management of the subsidiary companies. It draws into itself the Heads of thecompanies to assist in framing policy. It also has certain central organs which canbe used to assist the subsidiary companies with particular problems, or which canserve the main Board in the task of assessing present information and future trends.50. The analogy with a group of companies is not directly applicable in all respects to the case we are here considering, because the three Services have to operate together and have to be much more closely linked than the separatecompanies of a group. Nevertheless, there is a good deal to be learnt fromcomparison with outside practice, and it would be most unwise, in what we regard as an intermediate stage of the kind we now describe, to allow the Minister ofDefence to be drawn into the detailed administration of the Services.51. The organisation that we believe would be most suitable would be one inwhich the Minister, or the Secretary of State for Defence, assumed completeresponsibility for the whole military organisation but worked through acomparatively small central staff and three separate Departments, one for the Navy,one for the Army, and one for the Air. A Junior Minister, either Minister of state or Under-Secretary, would be at the head of each of these Departments. TheSecretary of State for Defence would also have a Minister of State as his Deputy.An essential feature of the plan would be that it should be recognised in parliament that the Secretary of State would only deal with questions of major importanceinvolving the three Services the Junior Ministers answering for all detailedquestions affecting their own Services.52. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence wouldbe the senior civil servant of the Ministry, but each Service would have its ownaccounting officer. Similarly, each Service would have its professional Chief ofStaff who, together with his colleagues from the three Services, would form, as now,the Chiefs of Staffs Committee under C.D.S.53. Each Service Department would require what can be described as a management Board, having approximately the same composition as the existing
Board of Admiralty, Army Council and Air Council. They might be called Navy.Army and Air Boards respectively, in order to emphasise the break with the oldorganisation. In any case, it would be made clear that they were in all respectssubsidiary to the main Defence Board, which would consist of the Secretary of Stateand his Junior Ministers, supported by such Advisers as might seem necessary.54. An essential feature of this plan is a drastic geographical redistribution.Each of the Service Ministries at present has considerable portions of its staff inpremises distinct, and sometimes remote, from their main Headquarter building.It is thus evident that it is possible to separate out what might be described as thecore of each Ministry which would be that part now housed in each Headquarterbuilding, shorn of any inessentials who are now disposed there to fill up the space.These three core organisations, together with a central core of the Ministry ofDefence, should be located in one building, the accommodation in which should beso allocated as to bring into close proximity those parts which should be in constanttouch. For example, the Secretary of State for Defence should have closelysurrounding him not only his own three Chief Advisers but the Junior Minister,the Chief of Staff, and the P.U.S. of each of the three Departments. Similarly, theNaval, General and Air Staffs should be situated adjacent to each other, and so on.55. The geographical distribution of the outlying Departments is also of greatimportance. Here again, the three Services should have similar Departmentsbrought together into one building. For example, the three Service PersonnelDepartments should be in one building, together with a small Secretariat from thecentral staff of the Ministry of Defence. This would enable the work of thePrincipal Personnel Officers Committee to be greatly eased, and close proximitywould breed a much better co-ordination of the problems of manpower andconditions of service.56. We do not believe that there are any insuperable difficulties in carryingout this plan. The creation of some vast Pentagon building is not required, as thenumbers that constitute the core of each Department are not very great. It seems probable that the new Government office now occupied by the Air Ministry andthe Board of Trade would be large enough for the hard core mentioned inparagraph 54 above. The present isolation of the Minister of Defence and thecompartmentation of the Service Ministries are major obstacles to the &quot; growingtogether &quot; of the Services and to the breaking down of out-of-date rivalries; and webelieve that any reorganisation which did not include this geographical redistributionwould lose half its value.57. We would like here to explain why we think that while three Servicesexist it would be inadvisable to organise the Ministry of Defence on a functionalbasis. We regard it as essential that there should be a perfectly clear chain of command and apportionment of responsibility both within the Ministry and theServices, and in the eyes of Parliament. This would not in our view be achievedunder the kind of functional organisation proposed by C.D.S. Under his schemethere would be nobody below the Minister of Defence himself who could take responsibility for some occurrence in the Army which did not solely concern afunctional Junior Minister, and few problems can be so subdivided. The greatmajority of disciplinary, organisational and administrative questions that arisewithin a Service are peculiar to that Service and affect more than one function.It is essential therefore that there should be at the head of that Service an authority which can handle these problems without burdening the Minister of Defence.They are the day-to-day management problems of a Service and in our view mustbe dealt with by a management board having on it the responsible functionariesof that Service. Otherwise all these problems would end up on the agenda of theDefence Board, and would absorb most of the time of the Secretary of State for defence.58. Similarly, as long as there are three Services we regard it as essential thatthere should be a professional head of each who is responsible for advising theMinister and the Government both in his individual capacity, and in his corporatecapacity as a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.59. If the geographical redistribution that we recommend is carried out webelieve that a good deal of the present difficulties would diminish and eventuallydisappear. The conception of the three individual Service Ministries, each in itsown fortress, would be brought to an end.   The principal people who together
must work to devise military policy would be close together and constantly in contact, and the Joint Staffs, whether planning, operational, administrative planningor logistical, would live close together and would grow closer together as time went on. The stage would be set for the eventual organisation which we refer to inSection C of this paper.60. The central core of the Ministry of Defence would not differ greatly fromits present form, adjusted as we have recommended in Section Although no doubtcloser examination would show that some changes would be necessary. Thecreation of a staff to handle more effectively the overall Budget might well be oneof these changes. The bringing together of the Service Departments as what mightbe termed the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Secretary of State would make it possible for him to do what is often done in large organisations outside, namely,to detach a team from his expert central organisation to comb through someportion of a subsidiary so that the main board can be satisfied that extravagancesand inefficiencies are brought to light.61. We now come to one of the most difficult questions with which we haveto deal, namely, the Ministry of Aviation. The Ministry of Aviation is thesponsoring Department for the aircraft industry, is responsible for the civilCorporations and civil aviation ground services, and conducts research,development and production of aircraft, missiles and electronics for both militaryand civil purposes. Figures that we have been given seem to indicate that of the research and development programme, three-quarters is attributable to military purposes and one-quarter to civil purposes. Nobody that we have spoken to inthe Ministry of Defence or in the three Services regards the present position asin any degree satisfactory. The majority regard it as essential that some part, ifnot all, of the Ministry of Aviation should be brought under the Minister ofDefence. Indeed, they go so far as to say that unless this is done no other partof the reorganisation will be effective. The reason why the present arrangementarouses such strong feelings is that the defence authorities feel completely baffledin dealing with a middleman who appears to conduct their affairs not onlyinefficiently but without a single-minded regard for defence interests. The research and development programme keeps on getting out of control financially. A goodexample of this is the case of the T.S.R.-2, the cost of whose development has risen from an estimate made last May of  137 million to an estimate made now of 175-200 million. It is generally admitted that some responsibility for the weakness of the overall R. and D. programme lies in the Ministry of Defence and we have referred earlier to measures designed to improve this situation. None of thesehowever affect the main contention in regard to the Ministry of Aviation. Thedefence authorities also feel that political and civil aviation interests are injectedinto the defence side of the work done by the Ministry of Aviation and that theDefence Budget gets loaded with greatly increased expense on this account.62. It has always been found that an organisation which places in a separatedepartment the development and procurement of weapons and equipment gives rise to difficulty. The user does not feel sufficiently in control of getting what he requires, and is not in direct touch with the designer and maker. The lessonslearnt from using equipment are with difficulty communicated to the maker. Forthese reasons the Admiralty have always built their own ships and made theirspecialised equipment and the responsibility for designing and procuring Armyequipment has now been transferred back to the War Office from the late Ministryof Supply. It is only the extreme complexity of aircraft and electronic devices andthe overlapping of the requirements of the three Services and of Civil Aviation that have justified the creation of the separate Ministry of Aviation. The usualdifficulties are just as evident in this case as they have been in the past elsewhere.63. Nevertheless, we do not believe that this is the main cause of the trouble.The fact is that the development of new aircraft and missiles which, because theyare to come into service 7 or even 10 years hence must embody the mostadvanced scientific knowledge, is inevitably a very expensive operation, the cost ofwhich cannot be closely estimated in advance. We doubt whether matters wouldbe greatly improved in the field of estimating by any change in the arrangement of Departments. Any proposal of this nature would have to rest mainly on other grounds.64. We recognise the force of the criticisms made bv the defence authoritiesbut we also recognise the strength of the case made by the Ministry of Aviation
for retaining their organisation intact. It is very hard to see how any separation of the whole process of research, development and production of these highlycomplicated systems of equipment, military and civil, could be made. We find ftdifficult to make a definite recommendation on the question, though it seems tous that there is one solution which is worthy of serious consideration.65. As things now stand the Ministry of Aviation, which is the GovernmentDepartment responsible for all aspects of civil aviation, acts on an agency basis for the defence Departments. This would appear to us to be a case of the tailwagging the dog. We do not see why it should not be possible to reverse thesituation, that is to say, to place the whole of its research, development and production work in a Department parallel to the three Service Departments underthe Minister of Defence, and to allow this Department to do the civil research,development and production work on an agency basis, for whatever other ministry was given the responsibility for the welfare of the aircraft industry and for controllingcivil aviation on behalf of the Government. This would appear perhaps to burdenthe Minister of Defence with an additional responsibility outside the field ofdefence, but we doubt whether the result would be so harmful as the present arrangement appears to be to the conduct of the defence budget and to the achievement of well-equipped armed forces.66. The great merit of such an arrangement would be that responsibilityfor his R. and D. and procurement programme would rest firmly with the Ministerof Defence, who would be able to satisfy himself, as with his other Departments,that the work was being tackled efficiently, and that knowledge of the progress ofthe programme was continuously available throughout his organisation.67. We cannot firmly recommend that this proposal should be carried out as it involves matters outside our terms of reference, but we believe that it shouldbe seriously considered.68. In either case we see no reason to make any alteration in the presentresponsibilities of the Navy and Army Departments respectively for the procurement of warships, tanks, vehicles and other military stores.69. Finally we would point out that if the scheme of reorganisation set outin this section of our Report is carried out the adjustments suggested in Section A,where still appropriate, should be included. The decision taken with regard tothe Ministry of Aviation does not affect our proposals for strengthening the research and Development Committee staff and for making the other additions to the central staff of the Ministry under the Chief Scientific Adviser.C. A Single Ministry and Fully-integrated Services70. None of the proposals that we have so far put forward constitute, inour opinion, the optimum in defence organisation. We believe that this would only be achieved when the Services are fully integrated. It would then be entirelypossible for a single Ministry of Defence to be organised on a functional basis withthe realisation, over a number of years, of very considerable economies. We must first, however, make it clear what we mean by the integration of the Services.71. When the integration, or unification, of the Services is mentioned, it oftenconjures up in the mind of the hearer a picture of the destruction of tradition andof units with long and glorious histories. It seems to be thought that the officersand men of the armed forces would merge into some kind of anonymous amalgam.This, of course, is a totally erroneous picture. What is meant can be described as follows.72. The quality which the nation must demand of its armed forces isprofessional skill. This must take two forms. First, tactical and technical skill.Sailors must be first-rate sailors both in the handling of their ships and in theuse of their weapons. Soldiers and airmen must be similarly adept at theirrespective trades. Secondly, strategical skill. This consists of the ability to look at warfare as a whole and to apply tactical and technical skill in the most effective way. What we want, therefore, is a system which will allow both forms of skillto develop to the full. If we examine the Services as they are now constituted we find just what we need within each Service, but not in the relationship betweenthem.  Let us take two examples.
73. A ship has a complement which consists very largely of specialists.Among the junior ratings and ranks there are a few who perform general duties,but the majority are assigned to particular tasks for which they receive special training superimposed on the basic training which all sailors are given. But when you reach the top of the hierarchy on board the ship you find the captain, a man who may earlier in his career have been a specialist in gunnery, or navigation, or air, but who now takes a general view and seeks to apply the power of his ship and the various skills of all on board to the best advantage.74. Similarly, in the Army the other ranks, after basic training, join one ofthe arms, cavalry, artillery, infantry, etc., and stay there for their whole service.The others, after a general education at a military college, also join their selectedarm of the Service. There they normally remain, except when they join officers from other arms on courses, at Staff Colleges, etc., until they reach the rank of lieutenant-Colonel. Then, those who are promoted Colonel cease to belong totheir arm, but go on to one list. This does not mean that when a senior jobrequiring specialised knowledge and training has to be filled it is given to anyoneon this list, regardless of his previous career. As a general rule an officer whohas spent his regimental career in the Royal Engineers would be selected to fill the post of Chief Engineer of a Corps, and so on. But all the Commands and higher staff posts are filled impartially by taking the best man. The only provisousually made is that the man selected must have had training at a Staff College.If you want to fill the post of Director of Plans at the War Office, or Chief of Staffof a Corps, you do not consider whether it should be filled by a Gunner or an infantry man; you choose from the list the man whose qualities and experiencefit him best for the job.75. These two examples are sufficient to show that each Service has developedwithin itself a system which provides for specialisation where it is wanted, and yet ensures overall unity in direction. The specialists are free to give theirenthusiasm full rein, and to press their own point of view. But they are all partof one Service, and are guided and governed by men who have graduated fromthe ranks of the specialist into a broader company.76. We have not yet achieved for the three Services in combination a system which is comparable to that which each Service has evolved for itself. Thespecialisation is there, it is true, but there is not that junction in the higher ranksthat alone can give the strategical skill we are after. We have glimpses of thepossibilities in the appointment of Unified Commanders in the Far East and middle East, but in general we have our triumvirates of specialists whereverinter-Service affairs have to be dealt with. It is rather as if a ship was commandedby a committee consisting of the Gunnery Officer, the Major of Marines, and theEngineer Officer, each of whom had under him one-third of the crew.77. There are several reasons why we should not allow this situation to persist. In the first place, the tasks of the three Services are not nearly so clearlydifferentiated as they used to be. The Navy flies, the Air Force devotes muchof its efforts to crippling the enemy&apos;s army and to transporting our own, and all three Services are equally committed in an amphibious operation. Secondly,the advance of scientific discovery has produced ideas and weapons which do notfit neatly into the picture of three separate Services. They tend to unify warlikeoperations, and it is more important than ever before that objective minds should examine the application of science to war. Thirdly, the nation can no longerafford the luxury of duplication and the waste which comes from adding together the demands of the three Services.78, An integration of the Services which we believe to be inevitable and desirable would follow the pattern sketched out above for each Service. Recruitswould enlist and serve throughout their time as sailors, soldiers or airmen,according to their choice. The Navy, the Army and the Air Force would remain,so far as their formations and units were concerned, as at present. Regimentswould preserve their customs and traditions. The Navy would still revere thememory of Nelson and recall with pride Taranto and Matapan. Battle of Britainday would lose none of its significance for the Air Force or the nation. officers would belong to their own Services until they reached the rank beyond that ofunit command. There would be no change in the uniforms of the men or theofficers up to this point. However, on promotion to Rear-Admiral, Major-General
or Air Vice-Marshal, the picture would change. They would be promoted, no matter what their previous Service, to the same rank of the Armed Forces of theCrown. From that moment on, they would cease to be one-Service officers,and although a good many specialist appointments would naturally be filledappropriately by officers with the right Service background, an increasing numberof posts would be filled impartially by taking the best man, regardless of his service origin. When this situation has been in existence for a few years, wewould arrive at the result so many people desire. The body of senior officers ofthe Armed Forces would be looking at war as a whole, and the harmful partof the present inter-service rivalry would be eliminated.79. The man who became C.D.S. after, say, 10 years of unification would indeed be as capable of exercising supreme authority over the whole field as theC.I.G.S. at present is over all arms of the Army. The single Ministry wouldbecome a reality, the planning and operational staffs in it would look much thesame as at present, with naval, land and air specialists in their old ranks anduniforms, but they would be directed by men who did not have to think whether any proposal prejudiced the future of their Service, but who were free to dealwith a proposal objectively as a problem of warfare.80. For this ultimate solution to be successful, it is essential that the singlelist of senior officers of the Armed Services should be a reality, which means a new list of ranks and a single uniform. The single list, in the form proposed inhis paper by C.D.S., will only go a part of the way towards what is required.You will not get the objective thinking and the real amalgamation of interests at the top if you leave men holding the present Service ranks and wearing theirold uniforms. We realise that this presents a considerable difficulty, but webelieve that it is one which must be surmounted in the national interest.81. This proposal is a bold one and arouses two objections, one sentimentaland the other real. The sentimental one is obvious, but is unlikely to carry muchweight with the younger school of officers, who will undoubtedly perceive thereal advantages open to them under the scheme. The real objection is this. Thescheme, in effect, equates a Service to an Arm of the Service. An integratedsystem of this kind can be applied to the Army, for example, because all unitsfight on land. Can it be applied to the whole of the Armed Forces when theyconsist inevitably of three such different Branches, the sea, land and air? Webelieve that although this objection has considerable force, the development of modern weapons is changing the situation to the point where it should not prevail.82. It will be seen that the geographical redistribution of accommodationthat we have urged in Section B of our report leads directly and easily towards an integration of the kind here described, and to the easy achievement of afunctional Ministry. The two would go together. Indeed we would recommendthat if the Government adopts the scheme in Section B, they should announce itas a step towards the ultimate solution. The later steps would have to be carefullyworked out, but we do not believe that many years would elapse before the goalwas achieved. We would then have a single Defence Council; a single Chief ofStaff, with a fully integrated staff serving him; a single Defence Councillor foreach of the main functions, and a single channel of advice to the Government.None of this can be achieved until then.February 1963.
