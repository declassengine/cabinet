Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1963C. (63) 4 Copy No.   5 214th January, 1963CABINETBRITISH POLICY IN RELATION TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THEFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDMemorandum by the Ftrst Secretary of StateFollowing my statement on Central Africa on 19th December, suggestions were made in Parliament that the Government^ action in regard to the secessionof Nyasaland was in breach of pledges given by United Kingdom Ministers at the1953 Conference on Federation. References were made to the confidential records of this Conference and it was suggested that these should be made public. On thesame day the Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky, used quotations fromthese records in the course of a speech to the Federal Assembly. The opposition in both Houses subsequently pressed for the publication of the confidential records of the Conference and this pressure will no doubt be resumed when parliament reassembles.2. In deciding how to handle this situation (which has also attracted someattention in the Press), the pressure of political and public opinion at home may bethe deciding factor. I also think, however, there is much to be said for setting the record straight and for removing the impression which may gain ground both here and in Central Africa, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have acted in bad faith and are sheltering behind the confidential nature of the Conference records.3. We can only do this by publishing relevant parts of these records, whichin my view would have to be covered by a commentary designed to make clear the scope and purpose of the discussions which took place, and to set them against their historical background. The most convenient way to present this material would be in the form of a White Paper. I attach the draft of a White Paper whichI have prepared, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor.4. If my colleagues consider that we should publish a White Paper of thiskind, we have to consider the question of timing. I think my colleagues felt, when raised this orally at the last Cabinet, that if we so decide this should be after myforthcoming visit to Central Africa. All four Governments in the Federation took part in the 1953 Conference and my visit will provide an opportunity of consultation with them. If we are pressed in Parliament during my absence itcould be said that I would make a statement on my return.5. I ask for the views of my colleagues on whether we could publish a white paper on the lines of the draft and, if publication is to take place, when.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W. 1,11th January, 1963.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
Draft White Paper
DRAFT WHITE paper. In his speech to the Federal Assembly on the 19th December, 1962,the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (Sir roy welensky) asserted that the Government of the United Kingdom, in acceptingin principle that Nyasaland should be allowed to withdraw from theFederation, proposed unilaterally to act in defiance of undertakings in 1953that the Federation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would be permanent. He further asserted that pledges were given byBritish Ministers to the effect that no change in the Federation wouldbe made by the United Kingdom Government without the consent of theGovernments of the Federation, the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland.2. The Federal Prime Minister, in support of his allegation that suchpledges were given, quoted from the verbatim record and Minutes of the1953 Conference on Federation. These were confidential documents anduntil the Federal Prime Ministers speech on the 19th December, 1962, hadbeen treated as such. Her Majesty&apos;s Government regret this departure fromestablished practice.It is not possible to answer charges of broken pledges based on the partial disclosure of confidential documents without reference to thosedocuments. In the circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decidedthat they have no alternative but to publish in full the relevant parts of theverbatim record and Minutes of the meeting of the Conference held on the19th January, 1953.   These are contained in Annex A to this paper.3. It will be seen from the verbatim record and the Minute that thesubject under consideration was the effect that the insertion in the proposedConstitution of a provision (eventually Article 99) for its review not beforeseven and not later than ten years after its inception would have on the credit and finances of the Federation. It was in this context that the questionof secession and &quot; voluntary liquidation &quot; came to be discussed, and discussedsolely in relation to what might happen at the review. The expectationwas (as the then Colonial Secretary subsequently expressed it in the Houseof Commons on the 24th March, 1953) that the review conference wouldnot &quot; decide whether the Federation has succeeded or failed, or whether itshould be abolished or continued &quot; but rather &quot; make such alterations in the detailed working of the Constitution as experience has shown to be necessaryduring the first decade of its life &quot;.4. It will be noted that in their initial remarks United Kingdom ministers had in mind the position of the four Governments (i.e., those of theFederation, the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland) vis-d-vis each other. Theywere speaking in the light of the intention that any amendments to theConstitution at a Review Conference of the kind envisaged would be secured by agreement between those four Governments. The position of the UnitedKingdom Government was first referred to by the present Minister of justice of the Federation (then a Southern Rhodesia delegate) when, in answer toa question asked by the then Colonial Secretary, he stated that theConstitution could not be upset without the intervention of the UnitedKingdom Government.Both Secretaries of State present then referred to the undeniable powerof the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate in whatever way it might1961B*
think fit for the Federation and the present Minister of Justice of theFederation himself endorsed this view. The United Kingdom Ministersemphasised that the United Kingdom Government could be relied upon notto act irresponsibly.5. The verbatim record shows that the remarks of the United kingdom ministers (which were of course made in good faith) were far removed fromany kind of pledge on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that her majesty&apos;s Government would not in any circumstances agree in principle tothe secession of a territory from the Federation and not legislate with regardto the Federation without the consent of the Federal Government and of thethree Territorial Governments. Such a pledge would have given to theFederal Government and each of the Territorial Governments a permanentveto whereby any one of them could insist on the indefinite perpetuation ofthe Federation as established in 1953, whatever might be the views of theother three Governments or of the United Kingdom Government on whatever pthe developing and changing circumstances might be.6. In the new circumstances that have arisen, namely the expressedwish of the majority of the inhabitants of one territory, a territory forwhich Her Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibility remained unimpaired bythe establishment of the Federation, to withdraw from the framework of theFederation, the remarks of United Kingdom Ministers at a discussion as tothe effect of the inclusion of a review provision in the Constitution on the credit of the Federation cannot be construed as a pledge precluding her majesty&apos;s Government from acting as they have.7. A pledge not to effect a change in the Federation without the consentof the four Governments would have vitally affected the relationship ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government with those Governments. If such a pledge hadbeen given, there was no reason and no justification for secrecy. As theLord Chancellor said in the House of Lords on the 19th December, 1962:&quot; In all the public documents and in all public announcements . . .one can find no indication in any contemporaneous document of theexistence of such a pledge.&quot;The verbatim record does not reveal that any such pledge was given in privateon the 19th January, 1953.8. The Federal Prime Ministers -as3crtafcion that Her Majesty&apos;governments action in relation to Nyasaland is in breach of undertakings given in 1953 regarding the permanency of the Federation is also not justified.It certainly was the purpose of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in endorsing theFederal scheme in 1953 to create a stable and lasting form of association between the three territories. This was clearly and publicly stated at the time.Her Majesty&apos;s Government however did not give, and were in no position togive, any undertaking or guarantee as to its permanency.9. In support of his accusations the Federal Prime Minister attached importance to the fact that the Constitution contains no provision conferringa right of secession: and quoted from the 1953 Conference records (see annex B) a statement by the then Commonwealth Secretary (Lord Swinton)endorsing the view that no such provision should be made.  This same view,
and the reasons for it, was also stated publicly in the House of commons on the 24th June, 1953, by the then Colonial Secretary:&quot; I think that to introduce into this marriage which we are about to solemnize opportunities for the parties to seek divorce before theyare joined together and to emphasize these opportunities would be veryimpolitic.&quot;It is not however to be inferred from the absence of such a provision that theconverse was the case, that in no circumstances could any provision forsecession be contemplated. If that had been the intention, it could havebeen provided for by a provision of the kind contained in the Preamble tothe Commonwealth of Australia Act, 1900:&quot; Whereas the people of New South Wales, etc., have agreed to unitein one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth . . .&quot;No such provision is to be found in the Rhodesia- and Nyasaland FederationAct, 1953, or in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (Constitution)Order in Council, 1953.10. Pledges were given by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relation tothe safeguarding of the protectorate status of the inhabitants of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland, and with regard to preventing amalgamation ofthe territories except in certain circumstances. These pledges were embodied in the Constitution. In the House of Commons on the 27th July, 1953, the then Colonial Secretary made this clear when he said:&quot; The effective way, which we have adopted, is to safeguard the protectorate status of the Northern Territories by constructing the federal constitution in such a way that these Territories remain separate anddistinct political entities independent of the Federation within theirrespective spheres, and continue to be under the responsibility of theSecretary of State for the Colonies and, too, subject to the authority ofHer Majesty in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. This, I can assure the House, the Federal Constitution certainly does. I say in the clearest terms that it will not be competent to interfere with theconstitutional position of either of these Territories, or, for that matter,of Southern Rhodesia.   So much for the Protectorate status.The effective method of preventing amalgamation except in certaincircumstances is to secure, as the Federal Constitution does, that her majesty&apos;s Government and, in certain circumstances, Parliament, have thelast word on constitutional amendments. This Government and futureGovernments will be under an obligation not so to amend it unless theyare satisfied that a numerical majority of the people concerned are infavour of it. These intentions are clearly set forth in the Preamble, thefourth paragraph of which makes it quite clear that without a numericalmajority of the people amalgamation is ruled out. The effective safeguard,however, is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament have the lastword on constitutional amendments.&quot;11. If any pledges of the character now alleged by the Federal PrimeMinister had in fact been given, there is no reason why they should not also have been embodied in the Constitution.3
ANNEX ACONFERENCE ON THE FEDERATION OF SOUTHERN RHODESIA,NORTHERN RHODESIA AND NYASALANDI.   Extract from the Verbatim Report of the Thirteenth Meeting held oiifMonday, 19th January, 1953Mr. Eastwood: There is one point. You remember we were dealing with!the Constitution the other day we dealt with this revision, not before seven Band not later than nine years. It has been suggested that that is a possible flloophole for secession and if not secession it might mean voluntary liquidation, IffCould anything be read into it at all. Is it likely to be inferred by the financial iworld?Mr. Lyttelton: I have not got the words in mind. I do not think you can jreview a Constitution off the map.  It is a question of review.Mr. Welensky: A review of the whole Constitution.Mr. Eastwood: Does that infer that there could be a possible voluntary!liquidation.Mr. Lyttelton : I should not have thought it went as far as that.Mr. Eastwood : I hope not.Mr. Lyttelton: The point being that the review was not earlier than the piseventh or later than the ninth and the Constitution would put into the field oilf;discussion total liquidation of the Constitution.A Delegate : A suggestion has been made for a review of the working of:the Constitution.Mr. Lyttelton : I think that would perhaps be safer.Mr. Hopkinson: I think this is very valuable.Mr. Eastwood.: I do not want to convey anything which might impedeour credit.Mr. Welensky : . . . the review.  This may envisage the complete break-upof the Federation.Mr. Unsworth : The working of the provisions of the Constitution.Mr. Lyttelton : You might knock them all out one by one.Lord Swinton: You would not, would you, because the Constitution willbe enacted to get a constitutional amendment. Supposing the actual reviewsaid on the whole those who are conducting the review, all four Governments,that certain variations in the Constitution are desirable. The way I imagimthat those alterations would have to be put into force should be, would it not by amendment to the Constitution passed through the Federal Assembly, ithat not so?Mr. Welensky : Yes.
Mr. Lyttelton: Nothing can liquidate the Constitution unless all four are agreed on it. I think in those circumstances that working of the constitution would be more sensible. I do not think you can add the other without theagreement of all four Governments.. Mr. Whitehead: Might I suggest that I do think there is a certain financialrisk in this. People are bound to ask what is going to happen if they cannot agree when this review body meets. Would it be possible to say whatamendments may be desirable at the end of the period of freezing?Mr. Lyttelton : My only comment on that is that you are already talkingabout credit and finance. You are talking with instructed people and not with public opinion uninformed. We must have an assurance from the lawyers that anything that is put in in this thing does not abrogate what I consider to bethe present position which is I think that without the unanimous consent ofthe four Governments in fact the Constitution could not be liquidated, andtherefore whether you are going to borrow your next 25 millions this is an argument which we hope they will understand but I do not think the electorateof Aldershot will quite frankly.  I think that is the answer.Lord Swinton: I think it is all right and I think after all there has been agood deal of trouble in getting this in. Our anxiety was that we all thoughtthat it was a good thing to have a review and that you did not put it in theearly years because then people might try to make it not work the thing willhave been working for at least seven years.Mr. Welensky: If you added the word &quot; working &quot; it would improve thematter, would it not?Lord Swinton : I am not sure that &quot; working &quot; would because you do wantamendments to come in.Mr. Welensky: What is the actual wording now, does anybody rememberit off-hand?Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray : In not less than seven nor more than nine years from the said date there shall be a Conference consisting of representatives ofthe Federation, the three Territories and the United Kingdom, chosen by therespective Governments for the purpose of reviewing the Constitution of theFederation.Mr. Lyttelton : I think it is quite safe from the credit point of view, PrimeMinister, I think we might leave it as it is.Mr. Welensky: I think we lose sight of one thing, that other than for theLegislative List other amendments can be made, so we are not interfering withthat. It is only the Legislative List that is frozen. The unfreezing applies tothat, but the review, as I understand, is going to be a review of everything now.Mr. Lyttelton : I think it has attractions as it is.Mr. Whitehead: If you are satisfied and the legal people are satisfied weare quite happy.Mr. Lyttelton : I think the position is that you cannot upset the Constitutionwithout agreement, can you?5
Mr. Greenfield: You could not do so constitutionally without the intervention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government here.Lord Swinlon : That is a risk you always run in a sense, that it would bepossible I suppose for Her Majesty&apos;s Government if they could persuadeParliament to do it to pass an Act of Parliament tomorrow morning to takeaway the whole of responsible government from Southern Rhodesia and thewhole of the functions which would be given to the Federation. You cannotlegislate against the United Kingdom Parliament going off its head.Mr. Lytlelton : That is Mr. GreenfiekTs point, it is the other way round.He means that as long as it requires the intervention of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment the lender is safe. Nobody is safe from the SovereignGovernment repudiating its obligations. In this case there would have to be four people to do it.Mr. Greenfield : In this case it is &quot; The Lord giveth and the Lord takethaway.&quot;Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray : If I might suggest a further form of words,something like this: &quot; When reviewing the working of the Constitution and considering any alterations in matters of detail . . .&quot;Mr. Lyttelton : That is right off the point, there are no details in a constitution. 1 am afraid that will not do at all. We are proposing to leavethese words as they are, all we are asking the lawyers for is an assurance that, with the concurrence of each and all of the Governments concerned,major alterations could take place in the Constitution.Lord Swinton : Is there anything ready for us for tomorrow, for a plenary?Mr. Lyttelton : Yes, a report by the Finance Committee on mattersoutstanding.   There will be a plenary at 2.30 p.rn. tomorrow.(The proceedings were then adjourned.)10 Carlton House Terrace, S.W.1,27th January, 1953.II.   Extract from the Minutes of the Thirteenth Meeting held on Monday,19th January, 19533.   Review of Constitution(Previous reference: C.A.F. (53) 12th Meeting, Minute 3)Mr. Eastwood suggested that the clause providing for a review of theConstitution after not less than seven years, which the Conference had accepted at their 12th Meeting (C.A.F. (53) 17) might impair the financialcredit of the Federation.The general view expressed by delegates was that, since any proposalto terminate the Constitution could only be put into effect with theconcurrence of the Federal Government and all three territorial governments, and of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, it
7was unlikely that investors would consider the proposed review clause areflection on the permanence of the Federation.The Meeting:Agreed that no amendment was required in the wording of the draftclause in paragraph 2 of C.A.F. (53) 17.
ANNEX extract of Statement from the 1953 Conference Record by the thenCommonwealth Secretary (Lord Swinton)&quot; I know no Federal Constitution within the Commonwealth, or indeedI think outside it, in which a secession clause is to be found, and there must bevery good reason for that, particularly when one remembers that there havebeen both within the Commonwealth and outside it, great jealousies of Stateand provincial rights when federation took place, yet great as those sectional,and provincial interests were territorially, never was such a clause inserted inthe Constitution measures except, which is delightful, Mr. Hopkinson (nowLord Colyton) reminds me, within the Soviet Union. It would be right to describe a claim to secede as a precursor of liquidation . . . there is oneabsolutely overriding economic objection to this which rules it out from thevery start. The Federation has got to raise (loans) on federal assets and federalsecurities. Make no mistake about it if you doubt my words ask anybodyin the City of London Federation could never raise a penny of money byloan if it were not known whether Federation was to continue, and thereforewhatever views you take about what I may call the moral side of the thing,there is an economic argument to which there can be no possible answer . . .&quot;8
