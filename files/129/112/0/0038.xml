(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)52C.(63) 38 COPY NO.__15th March, 1963CABINETFUTURE AGRICULTURAL, policy note by the Secretary of the CabinetThe attached memorandum which has been circulated to theEconomic Policy Committee by the Minister of Agriculture is circulated for the information of the Cabinet.(Signed)    BURKE trend cabinet Office, S. W. 1.5th March, 1963
FUTURE AGRICULTURAL policy memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the Committee is to consider for inclusion in the forthcomingWhite Paper on this year&apos;s Price Review a draft prepared by officials ( C, (63)33 ) of paragraphs dealing with the broad outlineson which agricultural support is to be reshaped.    I would like themto consider the alternative draft attached.2.     The changes I have made in my alternative ares-(a) I do not think it is enough for us merely to say that we intend to retain the &quot;fundamental objectives of the Agriculture Acts andthe general principles of support&quot;.     This will give rise tospeculation, anxiety and much questioning as to whether this doesnot mean that we intend to scrap the Acts and incorporate the objectives and general principles of them in fresh legislation.    Thisis not what Ministers intend and to let it be thought that they do would be political masochism.   A flat statement that we intend tomaintain the Acts - which is what I suggest - would not precludeminor amendments if they were found t* be necessary.(b) Paragraphs 1(b) of the official draft sets out as an aim to givethe producer a greater incentive to get as much as possible of his return from the price at which he markets his goods.    I think weshould also say we intend to give him an opportunity to do so, i.e.by preventing his efforts being frustrated by imports atexcessively low prices.(c) I am sure that we have got to be definite about our,intentionto consider both the limitation of the Exchequer&apos;s commitinent bystandard quantities and as a quid pro quo to prevent this objectivebeing frustrated by the erosion of the market price by imports.Not only therefore do I think that we must retain the paragraphproposed by my officials, but we must make it more definite on our intention to deal with imports at unreasonable prices.3.     Whether we refer to the possibility of transferring part of thecost of support to the consumer depends on the view which we takeabout the political expediency of mentioning this possibility at thepresent stage.C.S.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,London, S.W.1.4th March, 1963
CONFIDENTIAL ,        ^^PJPENDIX&apos; &apos;ANNUAL   REVIEW,  1963Draft paragraphs for White paper.     The experience of recent years has shown that, whilst the agriculture Acts should he maintained, changes are required in thearrangements for agricultural support.     The aim should he to bringunder more effective control the cost of this support whilstmaintaining broadly the present balance between home-grown and imported food, the producer being given a greater opportunity andincentive to get as much as possible of his return from the price at which he markets his produce.2.     A start has been made in this year1a Price Review.     The changein the guarantee arrangements for eggs and pigs are described inparagraphs X and Y above.     The Government has also announced its intention of making changes in the deficiency payments system forfatstock (see paragraph Z) .3.     Consultations with the Unions will now go forward on further measures designed to achieve the aim set out above.     These measuresmust take account of the possibilities of making arrangements forthe import of agricultural products which would be fair alike to producers and consumers and to exporting and importing countries,through such means as international commodity agreements.4.     It is the Government&apos;s intention to consider whether moreshould be done in the context of our general trading policies toprevent domestic prices from being undermined by imports at undulylow prices.     It will also be necessary to examine the possibilitiesof relating the cost of agricultural support more directly to production that is not in excess of what it is in the national interest to produce at home.Note.Alternatively, if my colleagues think it politic to mention the possibility of transferring part of the cost to the consumerthe last sentence above could read -It will also be necessary to examine whether it is practicableana desirable to control the liability of the Exchequer bytransferring in some part to the consumer the cost of agricultural support, and by relating that support more directly to productionthat is not in excess of what it is in the national interest toproduce at home.
