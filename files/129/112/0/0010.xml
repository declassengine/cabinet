0.(63) 10TELEVISION ADVERTISEMENT DUTY AND LEVY onINDEPENrJENT^TEFEVlSION PrBgRAJMLME&quot;&quot;&quot; ^contractors  &quot;Memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralCOPY NO.   (CABINETTelevision Advertisement Duty (T. A. D. ), which is a flat-rateduty of 11 per cent on advertising revenues, bears very heavily onthe smaller television programme contractors and in some cases isaffecting their services or even jeopardising their existence.    the television Bill will make effective, as from 1964, an additional levy on the contractors designed to ensure economic rentals.     provided this levy is adapted to bring in additional money equivalent to therevenue from T. A. D. , the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreedto abolish the latter as from 1964.2.   For.the Chancellor of the Exchequer, T.A. D. was an assuredand firm, source of income.    In order to replace it with somethingequally firm, and secondarily to avoid the difficulties inherent in alevy on profits, which further study suggests may be very real, theChancellor of the Exchequer and I now consider it essential to change the basis of the levy under Clause 7 of the Television Bill fromprofits to gross advertising receipts, on which T.A. D. itselfoperated.    A sliding scale, with a &quot;free slice&quot; before the levybegins, is envisaged to help the smaller companies.3.   I must announce a decision on this either before or during theSecond Reading debate on the Bill and, if my colleagues agree theprinciple, the Chancellor and I will concert together with regard tothis.    I should sa.y on Second Reading that we propose to amendClause 7 at Committee Stage.4.   In order to remove uncertainty it is also desirable to include,if possible in the Bill, the scale of levy to be applied.    We visualisethat it should be such as to recoup T. A. D. and obtain 50 per cent of overall current profits.    A scale on these lines is attached.Provision will be made for varying the scale from time to time by regulations laid before Parliament in draft for affirmative resolution.5.   We have suggested that the levy should be related to grossadvertising receipts (like T.A.D.) and not to total income.    Thiswould exempt from the levy the income the programme companiesSEiCRETIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
make from programme sales (at present this is  3 million).    Thisshould be an incentive to companies to produce good programmes which they can sell.    Two of Pilkington1 s objectives were &quot;to apply the incentive of profitability to the production of the best programme and &quot;to provide real competition in programme production betweenthe programme companies&quot;.6.   I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement.J.R.B.General Post Office, E.C.1.4th February, 1963.-2-S EC RET
