Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1963C. (63) 15 Copy No.    528th February, 1963CABINETPOLICY FOR EAST-WEST trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn his memorandum C. (63) 13 the Foreign Secretary has analysed the various points of friction which our trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc causes in our relationswith the United States. Before we consider these in detail we should, I suggestlook afresh at our trade policy with the Soviet bloc and decide whether, in thelight of the collapse at Brussels, we should modify it.Existing policies for East-West trade . Our policy for the last five or six years has been to promote the growth of East-West trade subject to three conditions: first that we did not becomeexcessively dependent on bloc sources of supply; secondly that we did not allowbloc imports to disrupt British industries and markets; thirdly that we enforcedstrictly the strategic embargo. Trade has steadily grown during the last fiveyears, although the rate of growth has levelled off in 1962. In 1958 our importsfrom the Soviet bloc amounted to  102 million and exports to the bloc were 46 million; in 1962 the comparable figures were imports  158 million and exports 111 million. This represents percentage increases of 55 and 144 respectively.Our imports from China have risen from  19 million to  23 million but exports have fallen from  27 million to  8 million. This fall is due to the Chinese need to import foodstuffs to the exclusion of almost all else. Despite these increases,our imports from the Sino-Soviet bloc are still only about 34; per cent of our total imports and our exports only 3 per cent of our total exports; we cannevertheless claim some modest success with the policy we have pursued.The factors limiting the growth in East-West trade. Our exports to the bloc are in fact limited by the extent to which theycan earn sterling which they use for purchases both in the United Kingdom andin the sterling area. In practice their earnings are nearly always inadequate andthe Russians regularly sell a certain amount of gold. Bloc policies are by traditionstrictly bilateral and the agreements which they have concluded with other tradingpartners tend to reinforce the rigidity of this bilateralism.4. For the foreseeable future it seems likely that the bloc countries willprovide a useful market for our capital goods industries; there are many things that they will want to import rather than manufacture themselves. But our potentialsales are limited to the extent that they earn sterling. They can only earn moresterling if we are prepared to import more from the bloc. As it may be increasingly difficult to find outlets elsewhere for the heavy end of British industry, it isimportant to consider whether we should modify our import policy.5. In short, in our trade with the bloc we find it easy to pay by exports ofthings we make well for goods that we need to import. By contrast, our traditionalsuppliers in the Commonwealth for foodstuffs and the Middle East for oil have tended to become more restrictive in their attitude towards imports of our goods.2081THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT

I do not suggest that there is a case for a radical review of our East-west trade policy. The political considerations which make it inadvisable to link ourcommerce too closely to the bloc remain, and the differences between their economicsystems and ours make it necessary to continue the existing framework of bilateral agreements and quotas. There are also political and economic difficulties inabsorbing more of the agricultural products of the bloc at the expense either ofother traditional suppliers, particularly the Commonwealth, or of domesticagriculture.7. Nevertheless I suggest that there is scope for making some modestincrease in our imports from the countries of the bloc without causing ourselvesundue embarrassment or exceeding the bonds of prudence. Moreover the pressure of public and parliamentary opinion is growing and we shall find it increasingly difficult to defend to responsible leaders of industry policies which deny themopportunities for legitimate expansion of trade. If we do increase Our importswe must expect that the bloc countries will want to spend their sterling on capital goods, particularly those of advanced design, for which we need orders. We already have some token quotas for our consumer goods but the bloc Governments haveshown reluctance to use them fully and it is hot worthwhile to try and force more on them. It is inevitable however that in selling capital goods our firms will need to draw to some extent on United States know-how of which the sale to the blocis subject to restriction.Policy towards imports from the bloc8. Our imports from the bloc countries fall into three categories: rawmaterials and basic foodstuffs on Open General Licence; manufactured goods which are imported under quota; and the &quot; sensitive &quot; foodstuffs and materials which are admitted only under licence (e.g., butter, bacon, oil).9. There is relatively little scope for further stimulation of imports whichare already under Open General Licence. These tend to rise and fall with thelevel of activity in the economy. It is possible that we could procure some increase by encouraging firms to conclude long-term contracts with bloc suppliers but the overall effect would be modest.10. It has been my policy to allow steadily increasing imports of manufacturedgoods. In practice these have been concentrated mainly on consumer goodssince the bloc countries are either unable or unwilling to supply capital equipment which meets the standards required in British industry.11. The real scope for an increase in imports is afforded by oil and agricultural products. - On oil I have already expressed my views. Where we have heavysurplus capacity in industries located in areas suffering, from unemployment, it makes sense to take essential-imports in exchange for additional exports. on agriculture the Soviet Union is already a supplier, and is potentially a large supplier,of wheat and coarse grain. The Eastern European countries are ready and indeedanxious to send us increased quantities of meat and of dairy and horticulturalproducts. Any increases in our purchases of these goods would result in animmediate increase in our exports. Larger imports of sensitive products such asbacon and strawberry pulp, though marginal in terms of quantities, will cause trouble with our domestic agricultural and horticultural industries, but we cannotavoid this if we are to exploit the opportunities of the bloc as a market for thecapital goods on which we depend for our living.12. I aim convinced that economically it would be sound to work for anincrease in Soviet bloc trade in both directions. Bloc imports will certainly beno more expensive than our supplies from traditional sources. Moreover- wehave some assurance that our exports will go up pan passu with our imports.
Special position of China13. Unlike the other Communist countries, China has not agreed to havebilateral trade negotiations with us. Our exports have fallen in the past two yearsowing to the Chinese need to import foodstuffs following bad harvests. Thereare indications however that their foreign exchange position is improving andthat they are now ready to buy a wide range of engineering goods. The breachbetween China and the Soviet bloc will lead the Chinese to seek more of their requirements from Japan and the West. Most of what the Chinese can export to us (except textiles) has free access to our market -and they also earn substantialamounts of sterling in other markets. Expansion of our exports from the presentlow level (of  8 million) to the 1960 level (of  31 million) or more is quite on thecards.14. I believe therefore that it should be our policy to encourage expansion oftrade with China within the limits set out in paragraph 2. We should encourage thekeen interest already being shown by our industrialists in this market and help themto take advantage of the substantial export opportunities which may offer. I shalldiscuss trade generally with the Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade when,as I hope, he visits this country shortly.Handling of United States objections15. In present circumstances, when we must export whenever we can onthe largest practicable scale, it is important that the United States should bebrought to show a greater understanding of our point of view than they have in thepast, and to refrain from public criticism. We should therefore make it clear thatwe cannot accept their pressures for restriction simply because they have afundamentally different approach to East-West trade. Any increase in our exportsto the bloc will be predominantly in capital equipment of modern design and willsometimes involve the use of United States patents and &quot; know how &quot;. We should therefore explain to the United States that it is our intention to expand exportsto the Soviet bloc countries, excluding only goods which are embargoed collectivelyin the Co-ordinating Committee (COCOM) which we shall, of course, continuestrictly to enforce and ask for them understanding of the need for this policy in ourpresent situation.16. We should, I consider, be ready if need be too remind the United states authorities that their own trading policies have restrictive aspects which are widelyresented in Britain. They have, for example, behaved badly on wool, glass, carpets,and whisky and in their &quot; Buy American &quot; and shipping policies. Pin-pricks about our trade with the Soviet bloc will only exacerbate British public opinion whichresents United States interference in our freedom to trade and regards the UnitedStates as &quot; preaching freedom but practising restriction &quot;.17. I shall be visiting the United States early in March and I propose to take this opportunity of explaining our policy to the United States Administration andthe feeling about it among responsible leaders of British industry.summary the bloc offers possibilities of a sizeable increase in our exports, say from thepresent 3 per cent to about 5 per cent. It is not the answer to our export problem,but is a valuable and growing market, particularly for the heavy end of the capital goods industry which is so depressed. We can secure this increase only if we are willing to take more of their agricultural produce, some of which is sensitive, andaccept modest imports of oil. We should, in my view, be willing to do this. Weshould explain our intentions to the United States Administration and ask fortheir understanding of our needs.F. J.
