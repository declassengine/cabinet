ItHIS document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)copy no.13th February, 1963CABINETSATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State form affairs in their paper on satellite communications, the Minister of aviation and the Postmaster General have recommended that weshould be prepared to negotiate with the United States and othercountries with a view to participation in a world-wide system, andthat we should only seek to establish a separate system, in conjunctionwith Europe and/or the Commonwealth, if we are unable to extractsatisfactory terms from the United States.2.     I v/elcome this proposal.    I do not think that a separateEuropean-Commonwealth system in competition with a United Statesone is in fact a feasible primary objective.    Even if the financial burden were judged acceptable and we were able to enlist support fora separate Commonwealth-European system, (which is unlikely) Iwould nevertheless be opposed to it on political grounds, since itcould only lead us into conflict with the United States, who are determined to establish a single system as soon as possible.    hi these circum-stances, a rival would be unlikely to achieve commercial success.3.      The acceptance of full international co-operation in theestablishment of a United States-led system need not mean leavingto the United States an undue measure of control.     No country canestablish a satellite communications system on its own, and a majorexercise in international co-operation will be required.    Our interestlies in seeking to persuade other countries, particularly those inEurope and the Commonwealth, to join us in using our bargaining power to ensure that the arrangements for design, construction,ownership and management are from the start such as to guarantee that, as other countries develop their technical potential, they willbe able to play a full part in the provision, as opposed to the mereuse, of a global satellite communications system.    The extent towhich we are able to achieve this will depend to a large extent on the institutional arrangements for the establishment of the system and itis only by giving a lead to the rest of the world that we shall be ableto reconcile our United States, Commonwealth and European interests.4.      The Minister of Aviation and the Postmaster General recommendthat we should now take the lead in trying to formulate E^aropeanviews.    Many of the questions that we shall need to discuss both with our European partners and subsequently with other countriesdo not come within the competence of Postal and TelecommunicationsAdministrations.    Apart from our European Launcher Development
Organisation and defence interests, there are strong foreign policyinterests involved in the establishment of a satellite communicationssystem.    These may be summarised as follows:-(a)    Unite^-Naj^n.s.      The General Assembly and its Committee onthe Peaceful Uses of Outer Space are certain to take alively interest in the development of plans for the establish-ment of a satellite communications system.    These plans are unlikely to be accepted without question, and under-developed countries in particular, if they think that the plans do not give sufficient consideration to their own requirements, may well suggest that the system should beestablished, owned and operated by the United Nations itself.This will need careful handling.(k)    Tjie Soviet Union.     It is obvious that the Soviet Union could make an important technical contribution to the establishmentof a global system.    Both we and other countries have taken the line in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Spacethat United States-Soviet co-operation will provide the best,if not the only, basis for full co-operation in the exploitation of space.    If the Soviet Union are not invited to co-operate in establishing a world-wide system, they are likely torepresent the system as an instrument of capitalist imperialism.This could make a considerable impact on the under-developed countries in the United Nations.     We need todiscuss this problem with other Governments.(c)    Technical Assistance and Political Considerations.     many countries will not be able to afford the ground stations, etc. ,they will need to participate in the system.    Much technical assistance and financial aid will therefore be required.Moreover, the principal participators will all be concerned to ensure that the system will adequately serve the countries with which they have the closest links.    We shall have our commonwealth interests in mind and the French will fight for full coverage of the ex-French territories in Africa.    Thepolitical objectives of the various principals are likely to be mutually inconsistent and, even if they can be reconciled,to conflict with the economic objective of setting up a system which will give the best commercial return.5.     It is obvious that considerations such as these will need to betaken into account right from the start, if we are not to set off on the wrong foot.    They cannot be left to the ad hoe Committee which theConference of European Postal and Telecommunications Administrationshas set up to study the problems involved in European participation in the establishment and management of a single global satellite communications.    Full inter-governmental discussions will berequired, and here we can take an initiative which will emphasise theleading part we wish to play in co-ordinating European policy.
I therefore recomrtiend that w.o sb.oiT.ld- invite selected european governments (Belgium, France, West Germany, Holland, Italy,Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway) to discuss the wholequestion at a Conference in London in, say, April or May of thisyear.    The object of Such a Conference would be to reach agreement on objectives, to identify the problems that will arise in the pursuit of these objectives, and to consider what steps will be needed inorder to resolve these problems.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,13th February, 1963
