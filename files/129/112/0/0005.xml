A. C. N.J. E. P.14th January, 1963.AnnexPOPULATION PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Health&quot; As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children. . . .Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.&quot;Psalm 127Preliminary figures of births and deaths for 1962 will be published in a fewdays. They will show that births in Great Britain at 945,000 were the highestfor any post-war year except 1947, which was the peak of the post-war &quot; bulge &quot;.We think our colleagues will wish to be aware of the far-reaching changes in the prospective future size and composition of our population which have been takingplace in the last few years.2. In 1955 the expectation was that this country would have a static andageing population during the rest of the century. To-day, mainly because of theunforeseen but steady and rapid increase in births which has occurred every year from 1956 onwards (in Scotland from 1954) (see Appendix) the expectation isthat we shall have a much larger and a somewhat younger population than was previously anticipated. The magnitude of the change in the outlook may be illustrated by the following facts (England and Wales only):(a) Size of population.- In 1955 it was estimated that the population ofEngland and Wales would be 46-4 million in 1975 and in 1995. Theestimate now is that it will be 51 - 6 million in 1975 and 60 million in 1995.CONFIDENTIAL
confidential(b) Age of population(i) In 1955 it was estimated that persons of retirement pension agewould rise from 14-3 per cent of the population to 18-3 per cent in1975 and 18-9 per cent in 1995. Now it is estimated that they will rise only to 16-5 per cent in 1975 and fall to 15-1 per cent by 1995.(ii) Children up to .15, instead of falling from 22-5 per cent inVf^      1955 to 19-9 per cent in 1975 and 19-2 per cent in 1995 are now expected to rise to 24-7 per cent in 1975 and 25-1 per cent in 1995.(iii) The total of persons over retirement pension age, or under15, which was 36-8 per cent of the population in 1955, is now expectedto rise to 40-2 per cent in 1995, instead of only 38-1 per cent as was expected in 1955.3. How long the upward trend of births, which has now continued for sevenconsecutive years (nine in Scotland), will go on, no one can say; nor whether,when it stops, it will be succeeded by a downward trend again.4.   The immediate causes of the rise in births sO far are that:(a) A higher proportion of people are marrying.(b) Those who marry are marrying earlier.(c) The interval between marriage and first birth, and between subsequentWhether people are also going to have more children does not yet appear. Wepersonally think it unlikely that the above causes can be at work without producingat least some increase in size of families. The estimates of future populationquoted above assume only that the trend noted so far will continue for the next two or three years and then level off.5. The deeper causes are obscure and will long, if not always, remain so.No doubt rising prosperity is among them; but we guess that there are alsoprofound psychological causes, and perhaps physiological ones too. But there isno mistaking the importance of the consequences. We must now changesubstantially our assumptions about the future of the country in ways which cannot but have implications for many of our policies, economic, social and political.births, is shortening.M.
