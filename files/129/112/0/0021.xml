THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1963C (63) 21 Copy No. 4 414th February, 1963CABINETTHE TELEVISION LICENCE FEEMemorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe paragraphs of the first White&apos; Paper on Broadcasting (Cmnd. 1770) dealingwith British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) finance are in the Annex.2. Majority opinion on the Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting and television was that the licence charge to viewers should not be increased untilearly 1965, and that with effect from 1963-64 the proceeds from the present  4licence charge, including the  1 excise duty, should go to the B.B.C. The FinancialSecretary reserved the Chancellor^ position pending discussion by the Cabinet,who noted the position for further examination.3. Nothing was said about B.B.C. finance in the second White Paper on broadcasting (Cmnd. 1893). But a decision is now urgent. The B.B.C. will havea deficit of about  1 million at the end of March and, without more money, thiswould amount to  17 million by March 1964. This exceeds their present borrowing powers of  11 million.4. The B.B.C. who seem to think they can hector the Government intodoing as they wish ask for the proceeds of a  5 licence from 1st April, 1963, and say they could then get by until about 1967-68 without a further increase.Alternatively, they ask for a  4 licence from April 1963, followed by an increase to  6 in 1965, supplemented by fairly heavy borrowings meanwhile.5. What is clear is that the minimum need is for the B.B.C. to have an extra 1 per licence in 1963-64.  This can be done either by(i) the Exchequer forgoing the  1 Excise Duty: or(ii) the public paying  1 more.6. Whichever course is adopted the licence fee itself, now  3, must be raisedthrough the machinery of regulations laid before each House of Parliament, whichare subject to the negative resolution procedure. This, allied to the time needed to produce the new licences and forms, brings us to August 1963, assuming we can get our preparations started by the end of this month.7. If, therefore, the Chancellor were willing to forfeit the  1 excise duty therewould be no need to increase the licence fee until 1965.8. The Chancellor has told me, however, that he is unwilling to part with theTreasury pound, but he naturally appreciates that we must consider the political implications of increasing the licence fee.9. As I understand it, the Chancellor^ view is that additional televisionfacilities should be paid for by the viewers themselves and not by the taxpayer. Thisis one of the difficulties, since the additional facilities will not even begin to appearuntil the spring of 1964, and then only in certain parts of the country. And, ofcourse, nearly all viewers are taxpayers and nearly all taxpayers are viewers.2103
10. There is no doubt that even an increase of  1 in the fee would do us.political damage out of all proportion to the impost. Whenever an increase hasbeen hinted at in the Press the public reaction, especially that of elderly people,has been violent.11.   I should value the views of my colleagues.J. R. B.Post Office, E.C.1,14th February, 1963.AnnexEXTRACTS FROM WHITE PAPER ON BROADCASTINGCmnd. 1770, July 1962Finance59. The proposals for more hours for sound broadcasting, a secondtelevision programme, a start to colour, Welsh and Scottish television, and moreeducational programmes for adults on the present television service will meanincreased B.B.C. expenditure. The Government accepts its responsibility to seethat the B.B.C. can secure sufficient income to finance adequate services.Borrowing60. The Government accepts the Committee&apos;s recommendations that theB.B.C. should have power to borrow up to  10 million for temporary bankingaccommodation, and up to  20 million for capital purposes, the latter subject, as now, to the approval of the Postmaster-General. It agrees that borrowing wouldbe an appropriate means of meeting a fairly short-term need for high capitalexpenditure over a limited period.
