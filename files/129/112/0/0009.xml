confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1963C. (63) 9 Copy No.   5231st January, 1963CABINETTHE SINO-SOVIET dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Sino-Soviet dispute has recently reached a phase of unconcealedbitterness: although the present series of polemical exchanges was begun last summer by the Chinese, the Russians are now deploying a heavy battery of counter-arguments. The nominal targets are still for the most part &quot; Albania &quot;or &quot; Yugoslavia &quot; or &quot; dogmatists &quot; and &quot; revisionists &quot; without specification. Butdirect references to the real protagonists are now at last being made on either side.2. My colleagues may like to be reminded of what the Sino-Soviet dispute,now in its sixth year, is really about. The fundamental issue is the correct strategy for expanding Communism, both against the West and in relation to the&quot; under-developed &quot; sector of the world. China and the Soviet Union remaincommitted to the long-term aim of establishing the Communist system throughoutthe world. They differ increasingly on how this should ved; and interwoveninto the complex skein of the dispute are also a struggle for authority in the worldCommunist movement and many issues of practical policy, national interest and personal rivalry.3. The Russians maintain that the correct method of achieving the long-termaim is summed up in Khrushchev&apos;s interpretation of &quot; peaceful co-existence &quot;.Starting from the premise that Communism is inevitably bound to triumph inthe end, they argue that capitalism can be replaced without war or violentrevolution, as Communist economic successes open the eyes of people throughoutthe world. History should be given a helping hand at every safe opportunity bystrong pressure upon Western interests. But the risk of major war must be avoided. For major wars would inevitably be nuclear, and nuclear wars would cause fearful devastation to Communist and capitalist countries alike. The maincontent of the recent Pravda article was an impassioned plea to the Chinese to cometo their senses on this subject.4. In practical terms this means that the Russians wish to conduct thestruggle against &quot; Imperialism &quot; as they have done in the case of Berlin, withoutpushing it so far as to involve a significant risk of nuclear war, though they may,as over Cuba, miscalculate about what is a significant risk. Vis-a-vis the Chinesethey maintain that this policy has already brought the world Communist movementa series of successes, including &quot; the frustration of American plans to attackCuba &quot;. The Russian policy may carry with it the need to negotiate with theUnited States in pursuit of certain limited and tactical agreements; it may also require expressions of a desire for friendly relations with the United StatesGovernment. The Russians regard the resulting association of &quot; Communismand peace &quot; in the minds of the rest of the world as of enormous propagandavalue to Communism.5. The first corollary of the Russian policy is a determined effort to build upthe Soviet and bloc economy to a point where its strength and prosperity canact as an attractive model to other countries. Khrushchev&apos;s recent stress on theimportance of economic competition with the West reflects this intention. Thereare other corollaries. It is not only direct conflict with the West that must be avoided, but &quot;local wars&quot; which could escalate into a major war. This means that the Russians are cautious in encouraging &quot; national liberation movements &quot;CONFIDENTIAL
against newly established Governments in Asia, Africa and Latin America, andthat they are willing to give a good deal of latitude to what they would describeas &quot; national bourgeois &quot; Governments.6. All this runs clean counter to Chinese ideas of priorities in foreign policy.Thf Chinese have more to gain themselves from an aggressive policy, and less to lose; they think that in the present balance of world power the Russians could afford to press harder on the Western Powers. They are particularly concerned that UnitedStates nuclear strength should not be allowed to deter the Communist bloc from amore active policy of spreading revolution. They would like to see the Soviet Unionpositively encouraging Communist Parties prepared to resort to violent action, andbelieve that in many areas this could be done with much less risk of escalation thanthe Russians believe. Although we have no direct evidence, the Chinese give the strong impression that Africa and Latin America are areas where they believe thatthe Russians could be more active. On the modalities of revolution, the Chinesestress that constitutional transition to the Communist system is exceptional: it will normally require the violent overthrow of bourgeois regimes. To take a case in point, India highlights this divergence: the Chinese contend that the Russians arenot only prolonging the life of a reactionary bourgeois regime with unduly largemeasures of aid, but actually support that regime against the Chinese who shouldbe their brothers in &quot; Socialism &quot;.7. Although the latest exchanges do not reveal any substantial new issues ofpolicy, they have thrown into relief the problem of whether there is to be a singlecentre of authority and interpretation within the Communist world, and where itshould lie. The Russians are clearly most concerned at the increasing evidence ofthe Chinese intention to set themselves up as an orthodox minority in conflict with abacksliding majority constituting the great bulk of the world Communist Parties.They say that this puts the whole monolithic structure of the Communist movementin greater jeopardy than ever; if it is applied to the movement as a whole it can alsobe applied to individual Communist Parties with endlessly divisive results.8. The latest round took place at the East German Communist Party Congresswhich ended on 21st January, and which Khrushchev himself unexpectedly attended.Neither the Russians nor the Chinese budged an inch on any major issue in dispute.Khrushchev offered the Chinese unity on the basis of tolerance of their internaldeviations, but capitulation to his terms on bloc external strategy. He must haveknown that this offer would be unacceptable. The Chinese also called for unitybut have made it equally clear that they will not compromise on their principles;they have added their own unacceptable condition that the Russians should firstadmit they were wrong in attacking Albania. In the meantime Khrushchev hascalled for an end to public polemics and for a breathing space before any conferenceof world Communist Parties (for which the Chinese have appealed) is held, so thattempers can cool down. The Chinese say they would welcome an end to publicdiscord but would like to see the Russians practising what they preach first. If the truce had any hope of life, it has probably now been extinguished by yet anothersalvo from Peking.9. A state of impasse has therefore been reached between the two parties.It is difficult to foresee how the dispute will develop. A continuing deterioration of relations seems likely but it is impossible to judge its pace. In the meanwhilea number of links and commitments between the two giants in the economic and strategic fields will probably survive for reasons of mutual interest.10. We should not assume that the intensification of this dispute will of itselfneutralise the immediate dangers and tensions which exist in the world to-day. Wedo, however, benefit from the dispute because of the damage it does to the imageof Communism; and if we cannot do much directly to exploit it, we can ensure thatit receives informed publicity, so that the issues involved are correctly understood as widely as possible. A number of Communist Parties have made it clear thatthe mere fact of publicity is distressing to them.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,31st January, 1963.CONFIDENTIAL
