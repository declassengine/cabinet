summary the paper points out that the best method of exploiting space com-munication cannot be fuLLy assessed unLess the worLd&apos;s communicationneeds are known. Methods of predicting the number of circuits re-quired over international routes are suggested and these methods are considered to have sufficient accuracy for initial planning.It is deduced that the countries with thegreatest need of space com -munication are those with substantial ocean carried trade. The UnitedStates of America, United Kingdom, Japan and Germany would benefitgreatly in that order and the largest terminaL station would be thatserving the United Kingdom - European teLephone network. The heaviestintercontinental space traffic may be expected between Europe and africa.At least 87 separate routes requiring one or more circuits will be involved of which 53 wilL need ten or less circuits. Systems which can offer 600 or 1000 channels but only between two points, do not seem tobe appropriate for the world&apos;s requirements.

The telephone which, is now 85 years old has enjoyed uninterruptedgrowth in nearly all its phases since its invention in 1876.    There are pre-sently 125 million telephones in the world and the number is increasing at separately of 6% per year.    It is safe to predict that this growth will continue formany decades.     Half the world&apos;s telephones are still in one country (theUnited States of America) and if the whole world reached a parallel level of telephone development there would be some 3,600 million telephones or30 times the present total.     At the present rate of growth this would takejust less than 100 years.     Telephone communication clearly has extraordinarypotential growth.Each of the existing 125 million telephones is connected to its ownlocal exchange which is in turn linked to other exchanges by junction andtrunk circuits.     The present level of telephone development has only been achieved by a proportionate development of these interconnecting circuitsand there has been no serious technical impediment to the provision of suchlinks.     In highly developed countries they are in the main available inadequate numbers and even in the less developed countries their provision is proceeding apace.The development of long distance international telephone circuitsrequired to link the complex networks of individual countries has provedmuch more difficult.     To give an example, a commercial telephone service was opened between Boston and San Francisco, a distance of 2,400 miles, in1915.     Yet the first international telephone circuit between Britain and theUnited States (a low frequency radio link) did not become available until 1927and high grade transatlantic circuits did not become available until 1957,eighty-five years after the telephoned invention and forty-two years after theopening of the first Boston to San Francisco connection.It is clear that the natural commercial development of this most valuable branch of telephone communication, valuable in terms of contribu-tion to world trade, in terms of international understanding and in sheermonetary return, has been retarded.     The hold up has been caused by thetechnical difficulties of providing the necessary circuits.     The first difficulty,only solved.in the last decade, has been the provision of efficient long distancesubmarine telephone cables.     The second is the inherently severe limitations of short wave radio as a carrier for long-distance telephone service.It now seems certain that space communication can remove nearly allthe limitations of existing long-distance radio systems and that the provisionof many hundreds of high grade long-distance telephone circuits via spacesatellites is an imminent possibility.     Much thought is being expended on thesubject which is potentially one of the most rewarding to which man has everset his hand.     The problem, however, is a very complex one and to suggestit is anything less will be to render a disservice to its solution.     There are
many variables. The satellites may be active or passive. They may be placed in orbits of differing height and shape. They may take up positions in "stationary" orbit. They may use any frequency from 1,000 - 10,000 Mc/s and they may employ a wide variety of bandwidths and modulation systems. With so many variables there are undoubtedly many systems which can be made to work. Indeed this is not a field in which the technical choices are necessarily clear cut. Before an assessment of the potential value of a space communication system can be made therefore and before the merits of different proposals can be compared with any degree of confidence, it is going to be necessary to evolve a clear view of where the many hundreds of circuits which can be provided are required and where their provision will be economic.

This poses a relatively new problem. Until recently circuits have been so difficult to provide that development has concentrated on routes where the need is very great and the economic value unquestioned. It is safe to say that there are very few long distance international routes currently provided with enough circuits. The many hundreds of circuits possible via space make it essential to make a broader approach to the problem and in fact to carry out an overall assessment of the world&apos;s international telephone communication needs. Unless this is done in the first place, space communication planning will not be soundly based.

How are we to establish the need for world-wide telephone circuits Internally, within the boundaries of any one country, telephone growth between any two centres is estimated by examining the existing traffic between the two centres and by studying its growth in the preceding twenty years. Future growth is then estimated by projection making due allowances for industrial and commercial factors special to the centres being examined and by considering in addition, trade trends. Such a method is reasonably satisfactory between, say, London and Glasgow where there has been a well established trunk route for 36 years.   Unfortunately it breaks down over most international routes because the existing facilities are rudimentary or even non-existent. You cannot plot growth where there has been none. If Graham Bell had been asked in the 1870&apos;s to predict the telephone growth of the 20 or 40 years which followed, he could only have hazarded a wild guess and the probability is that it would have been a gross under-estimate. Clearly another approach must be made.

First, let us begin by establishing where space circuits will not be wanted.  Space circuits may technically be as short as wished but since the value of a circuit is a function of its length it is clearly desirable to employ space facilities for long haul circuits. In practice it is likely that space will be used for routes of length greater than 1, 000 miles. Circuits of less than 1, 000 miles will generally be better provided by surface cable, surface radio links or submarine cable.

Similarly, non-international trunk routes within a single country&apos;s boundaries are not likely to be provided by space circuits, since it can be assumed that the population centres in any one country will be linked by road and rail alongside which it will be sensible to lay cable or provide microwave
More specifically, space circuits will not be appropriate internallywithin the continent of Europe nor between Europe and the United Kingdomsince highly developed surface systems exist linking these areas and thesesystems are being continuously expanded. Similarly, space communicationcircuits are not likely to be justified in the North American Continent wheregood surface communication facilities exist or will soon be provided.More positively space communication can play a major role in providinginternational telephone circuits over the following routes:-1. Across the Atlantic linking the United Kingdom and Europe to north America:On this route the demand for circuits will be high.   Space willhave to compete however with recently provided submarine cableswhich are proving efficient, highly profitable and which are beingexpanded rapidly.2 . Between Europe and Africa:The linking of Africa to Europe with a highly efficient telephone service is perhaps one of the greatest contributions that space com-munication can make to international progress.   There are fiftyseparate telephone networks in Africa. With a few exceptions theyare connected to Europe via erratic part-time radio circuits whosenumber, quality and reliability are far below present needs. some have no telephone connection to Europe at all and connections betweenthe different African networks are either rudimentary or non-existent.Yet Europe and the United Kingdom draw much of their raw materials from Africa and send in return great volumes of manufactures.   the african Continent is expanding and emergent, yet the Continentsinternational telephone need cannot readily be improved by conven-tional means.   Here is a role of the greatest importance for spacecommunication.3. From North America to South America and from Europe to south America:Space communication has clearly an important role to play overboth these routes though it may on some sections have to justifyitself economically against surface routes in the former case and submarine cables in the latter.i4. From the United Kingdom - Europe to the Middle East :Here again communication facilities to Middle East countries are rudimentary and the need for modern circuit provision is great.There could, however, be some competition from surface routes tothis area.
Note. 1.   On these routes satellites may have to be used two or three timesover to effect connection and development may therefore be slowerdue to higher operating costs.   Transmission delay also becomes a problem on these routes.North America to Far East:Both these routings stand greatly in need of circuits.   The Asiantelephone networks are poorly connected to the West and interconnect-tion is equally poor.   Space communication can play a major role inconnecting up the many territories in this area and in linking them tothe American and European networks. (1)6. From the United Kingdom and Europe to Australia and New zealand and North America to Australia and New Zealand:Space communications will have a role to play over these routesbut it will be in competition with round the world telephone cablesalready scheduled.Having defined the main areas which space circuits may be expectedto connect, how are we to estimate the relative heed between these different areas ?   Since growth rates cannot be studied effectively, how are we toestimate the relative and absolute level which telephone traffic might achievebetween the many countries of the world in question?   It is probable thatreasonably reliable estimates can be evolved from two criteria, first inter-national telegraph statistics and second international trade statistics.   Thelatter are readily available in great detail, the former are not so readily available but given time these too can be obtained and analysed.TELEGRAPH COMPARISONSLong-distance international telegraph circuits have been well estab-lished for many decades.   The technical difficulty which has until recentlyretarded the introduction of the telephone submarine cable, namely the dif-ficulty of providing submerged amplifiers, did not retard the developmentof the international telegraph cable which is almost as old as the telephone.It is a curiousity in a history of relentless telecommunication progress thatan efficient telegraph system linking Europe to the furthest corners of the earth was established in the 1890&apos;s, whereas we are still many years av/ayfrom achieving its full/ telephone equivalent.International telegraph traffic is still growing at least as fast as world trade which suggests that demand is still greater than supply:   neverthelessmost countries in the world now have reasonable non-delay telegraph services.   The telephone is clearly a much more valuable service than the telegraph and if we can establish an approximate factor expressing theeconomic regard in which it is held in relation to the telegraph, it should be
possible to begin to form estimates of the potential international telephone 1 fj J traffic by relating it to existing international telegraph traffic.First of all, if we look at internal telephone/telegraph earnings oftwo important countries we find they are as follows:-1.        U.S.A. (1959) Telephone $8, 000 million^U.S.A. Telegraph $260 million a ratio of 30 : 1(2)2.        United Kingdom (1957) Telephone  160 millionUnited Kingdom Telegraph  4 million a ratio of 40 : 1Clearly in the internal communication systems of these two highly developed countries, the public demand for the telephone is valued verymuch higher than the telegraph by a ratio of between 30 or 40 : 1.   However,internal telephone figures are weighted by a large volume of private localtelephone traffic which cannot have any equivalent in telegraph revenue and.we should be well advised to look elsewhere for a more rigorous relationship.For this purpose we need the telephone/telegraph earning ratio for pairs of countries where both services have been on a well developed &quot;on-demand&quot;basis for a substantial number of years.     There are, significantly enough,only a few countries in this happy situation.    Many countries are separatedby great distances or formidable geographical barriers.    If ocean intervenesit is only recently, as we have stated, that submarine cable telephone service has become possible.     Further, telephone development between many countries has been artificially retarded by two periods of prolonged war andaftermath.     However, there are a few pairs of countries where one might expect to find a natural settling down between the telephone and telegraph services and it is suggested that some of these are as follows :-U.S.A. and CanadaGreat Britain and FranceGreat Britain and BelgiumGreat Britain and HollandGermany and SwitzerlandNorway and SwedenStatistics so far obtained show the following trend:-United Kingdom - France Telephone to Telegraph 3.6 : united Kingdom - Belgium Telephone to Telegraph 5.2:united Kingdom   -    Holland     Telephone to Telegraph      5      : 1These figures suggest that on the reasonably well developed routes between Britain and France, Belgium and Holland, the communicating publicvalue the telephone service at between 3.6 and 5.2 times the value of the telegraph services.    As figures become available for the other countriesNote 2.   It is   interesting to note that these figures are 1.5 and 1 per cent respectively of the Gross National product of each country.   Further,the ratios of 30 and 40 to 1 are curiously near the ratio of the band-widths of a telephone to telegraph circuit, viz: 30 to 1.
cited, a more mature assessment of this ratio can be established:That the telephone service is fundamentally more valuable than the telegraph service given equal development of both, is something that can scarcely be questioned.   Examination of the telephone/telegraph earningsex. United States of America and ex. United Kingdom show however, thatthe expected relationship is completely reversed and telephone trafficproduces only a fraction of telegraph traffic revenue.   Thus:Total U.S.A. revenue from International . .Telephone   Traffic (1959) = S38 million^3)Total U.S.A. revenue from InternationalTelegraph Traffic   (1959) ^ $84 million total United Kingdom revenue from InternationalTelephone Traffic   (1957) ^    3 million (3)Total United Kingdom revenue from InternationalTelegraph Traffic (1957)  8 millionThus the total value of international telegraph traffic for these twocountries exceeded the value of telephone traffic in both cases by a factor of nearly 3 to 1, and this can be taken as an indication of the under-developedstate of telephone communication, out of both of these leading countries.   Ifit is taken that a natural ratio under present conditions is 4 to 1 in favour ofthe telephone, it might be estimated that a space telephone system freelyavailable today over the same routes as the existing telegraph systemswould earn 4 times the present telegraph system - in the case of theUnited Kingdom the earning would be  32 million per annum or 12 times thepresent level.It is clear that a detailed study of the telegraph traffic between theworld&apos;s countries should be made and that from this a first order estimateof both the absolute and relative telephone revenue to be anticipated from each route can be made.    The carrying out of such a task is of great impor -tance and it is felt that results should be made freely available for thebenefit of those concerned with space communication planning in all countries.TRADE COMPARISONSIn the meantime a second relationship can be examined to advantage;namely that between international trade and international telephone traffic.Long-distance international telephone calls cost about  1 per minute.   Atthis cost few calls will be made for frivolous or unrelated reasons.   It iswell known that the majority of such calls relate to trade.   Further it isknown that international telegraph traffic reflects trade trends and it is to beexpected that telephone traffic would follow suit when circuits become freelyavailable.    If it is possible to relate even approximately the telephoneNote 3.   Both these figures have been rising rapidly since the introduction ofthe Transatlantic Telephone cables.
potential, between any two countries to the trade that fLows between them, then *the pattern of communication need wiLL become predictable.     Such a relation- jship is more fundamental than the telephone/telegraph relationship and in&apos;theLong run is Likely to be more reLiabLe.A further Look at some of the small number of countries, where thereare aLready reasonably adequate telephone Links to reveal trend, shows thefollowing: - .Canada to U. S. A. vaLue telephone traffic to vaLue of trade    = 0. 76%United Kingdom to France vaLue telephone traffic to value of trade 0. 7 %United Kingdom to BeLgium vaLue teLephone traffic to vaLue of trade = 0. 4 %United Kingdom to HoLLand   vaLue teLephone traffic to value of trade    = 0, 3 %Such figures suggest that a figure of 0. 5% might be taken as a firstpLanning approximation.     It invoLves the proposition that for every million dollars worth of trade the user would be prepared to spend $5000 on first classtelephone facilities with the country concerned.     This does not seem unreason-able and there are a number of reasons to suppose that,  if teLephone communi-cations were freeLy avaiLabLe between trading countries, the percentage would begin Lower and would saturate a good deaL higher than 0. 5%.If we now consider the routes previously suggested as being appro-priate ones for space telephone services and appLy the 0. 5% factor to the relevant trade figures, we can then predict the revenue which can be expectedbetween pairs of countries at this intermediate development stage.     Furtherif we take the totaL earnings of a single transatlantic teLephone circuit astypicaL of space circuit potential earnings, (a figure of the order of$120, 000 p. a. ) we can predict from the trade voLume between two countries the number of circuits LikeLy to be required.Thus:number of circuits = TotaL doLLar vaLue of trade in both directions x0. 005120,000The resuLts of this exercise are extremeLy interesting and are shown inthe tabLes.TABLE I (See FigWestern Europe to United States and CanadaWestern Europe to South AmericaWestern Europe to MiddLe EastWestern Europe to Far East     ...        ...Western Europe to Africa ...        ...        ...Western Europe to AustraLia &amp; New ZeaLand   . . .TOTAL  Space Circuits ex.

Lists of countries forming these groups are given in Appendix A.The pattern which emerges from these figures shows that substantially more circuits are required out of Europe than out of the United States.   Ifthe mutual circuit requirement is set on one side, the requirements are 700circuit from Europe to other parts of the world and 473 from U. S. A.     Thissuggests that the terminal carrying the Largest traffic wilL be Located inEurope either in the United Kingdom or on the continent and the second biggestterminal wiLL be in the U. S. A.Based on simiLar trade consideration the countries with the greatest needfor space circuits are as foLLows:1.     U. S. A. totaL circuits required 11162.     United Kingdom totaL circuits required 6503.     Japan total circuits required 2394.     West Germany totaL circuits required 2195.     Australia &amp; New ZeaLand totaL circuits required 1996.     France total, circuits required 1187.    HoLLand totaL circuits required 89Once again these figures inc Lude transatlantic traffic:   a substantial proportion of this is carried now by high-grade submarine cable. If aLltransatlantic teLephone traffic is in the event carried this way, the :.&apos; :figures become:1.     U. S. A. totaL space circuits required 4382.     United Kingdom totaL space circuits required 2483.    Japan total space circuits required 2384.     West Germany totaL space circuits required 245.     Australia &amp; New ZeaLand totaL space circuits required 1996.     France totaL space circuits required 377.     HoLLand totaL space circuits required 49These figures show broadLy the pattern of the need of space teLephonecircuits and they emphasise that the greatest need is by the countries heaviLyengaged in ocean-going trade.     The dominant area of this trade is betweenthe countries whose seaboards are on the North and South Atlantic.Note 4. Definitions of these groupings of countries are given in Appendix A.
The total world requirement based on a 0. 5% trade factor would be for1643 circuits which might be expected to grow to 32 00 circuits as utilisationprogressed towards a 1% factor. The requirements will further increase asworld trade grows and a global system with a twenty year life should be planned for some 6 to 7 thousand circuits.The global earnings of a well established space communication system(1% of present trade levels) might be expected to be of the order of$380, 000, 000 justifying a capital investment of perhaps $1100, 000, 000.The comparable figures for a single country, the United Kingdom, would be$110, 000, 000 justifying a capital investment of some $330, 000, 000( 166, 000, 000).These figures are based on the simple assumption that an average spacecircuit will be neither more nor less economic than a single transatlanticcable telephone circuit.   If space circuits prove to be more economic then the number of space circuits will be less.The pattern evolved from the analysis shows that a world space telephonesystem must be capable of carrying a large total number of circuits but thatthe total will be made up of many groups of widely varying numbers of circuitsover many routes.conclusions.    Space telephone systems cannot be planned and engineered unless the pattern of the world&apos;s communication needs is recognised and understood.That it will follow closely the pattern of ocean borne world trade, as outlined,  seems reasonable.2.    Using this relation it is possible to make an assessment of the need for international telephone circuits between any two countries with sufficientaccuracy for initial planning purposes.3.    The assessment shows that the largest international need is betweencontinents which have seaboards on the Atlantic Ocean.4.    There will be two major terminal stations, the largest of which will serve primarily the maritime nations of Europe, including the UnitedKingdom.    The second major terminal will serve North America.25.    More than   /,3 rds of the worlds space communication needs could be served by a single satellite in stationary orbit over the North Atlantic .6.    The nations which will benefit most from space communication develop-ment and therefore those with the major responsibility in its provisionare those with the largest ocean borne trade.First on this list is the United States, followed by the United Kingdom,Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, Japan is third, but it should be rememberedthat 100% of her exports are ocean borne.   The largest continental responsi-bility lies with Europe, including the United Kingdom.
