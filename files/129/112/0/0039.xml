Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Minister of Housing and Local Government has putforward in C.(63) 35 of 4th March the line that he feels he shouldtake when he replies to questions on Thursday, 7th March.    I agree in general with his assessment of the position which in many ways is less anxious than we feared.    But I do feel that the almost whollynegative replies that he proposes to give could lead to a good deal of trouble.    It is a fact that there is real worry about the level of rates,that rating is probably the most unpopular of all forms of taxation andalso that the incidence of the rating system is politically unfortunatefrom the Governmenfs point of view.    No doubt some people are, asthe Minister says, &quot;living in houses beyond their means;  or in areasbeyond their means&quot;, but this is no comfort to them.    Naturally also those who are on the wrong side of an average figure are infuriatedwhen we point out the position in the country as a whole: just as inthe same way it does not help those in Northern Ireland or theHartlepools to be told what the national average of unemployment is.I also share his view that an enquiry may not produce any newidea.    Nevertheless, I do not think we should turn this down.   It is,after all; only an enquiry for which we are asked and I am sure it wouldbe of great help to us in these next few weeks if we could meet thedemand.    Perhaps the Minister would consider whether he might be rather more forthcoming on this point in his reply on Thursday andwe could then give urgent consideration to the form such an enquirymight take.COPY NC.525th March, 1963CABINETRATINGI.M.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, S.
