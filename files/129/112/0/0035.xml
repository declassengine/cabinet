CABINETRATINGMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh affairs since the new valuation lists were made public there has been mountingpressure for some relief to be given to householders, and there are three motionson the order paper calling variously for an inquiry into new sources of local revenue and for the Government to assume more of the cost of local services. I had beenintending to bring the whole question before my colleagues in the near future, butI now have Questions from Mr. Dudley Smith, Mr. Harold Davies and Mr. StanAwbery, down for oral answer next Thursday (when I am 1st order) which willforce me to take a line, one way or the other.2. First, the background. Revaluation as such does not affect the totalcollected in rates; but it does affect the proportions in which different classes ofratepayer contribute to that total. On the old valuation list commercial andindustrial buildings were.in different degrees derated and houses were assessedon the basis of 1939 values; on the new list all are assessed on full current values.By and large industrial rateable values have shown the sharpest increase, whilerateable values of commercial property have increased by less than the average,because they were already based on current values less 20 per cent. Of coursethere are big variations in the way individual properties have fared.3. Taking the country as a whole householders will pay much the same shareof rates as before. But in areas with little industry particularly places likeBournemouth or Blackpool the householders&apos; share will be bigger, sometimesquite a lot bigger; and since local expenditure continues to rise they will be paying a bigger share of a bigger bill. It is from this type of area that most of the pressurecomes. Householders in heavily industrialised areas will very likely find themselvespaying less in rates, despite the rising tide of expenditure. They keep quiet.4. The burden of the complaints is that rates are unfair in their incidenceand bear most heavily on those living on small fixed incomes. There is some truth in this; rates certainly absorb a larger proportion of small incomes. It is also truethat rates have been rising faster than taxes in recent years. But even so for theaverage household they still come to rather less than 10s. a week. To some extent the problem is one of people living in houses beyond their means; or in areasbeyond their means.5. I think that the demand for an inquiry must be resisted. Those pressing for one point out that there has been no public examination of the subject formany years; but much thought has been given to the subject, both in Governmentcircles and outside, and it can be said with confidence that there is no prospect of finding any worthwhile new source of revenue which would be genuinely local in character, fit in with our national system of taxation and be more equitable inits operation than rates. The only real runner is a local income tax. Such a taxappeals to the Opposition who see in it a way towards further redistribution of incomes. To this extent it would not attract our own supporters, except for thosewho are clinging on to a house or bungalow, with a fixed income eroded over theyears of inflation.  A local income tax would be costly to raise: and complex to2181Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1963C. (63) 35 Copy No.     5 24th March, 1963
distribute. In fact it would only help the small owner-occupier if the value of his property as a source of income or its equivalent were ignored, in which case therewould be a sizeable shift of burden.6. As for the proportion contributed to local expenditure by the Exchequer,trigS is not suitable for an independent investigation; and though the time may come when this will have to be looked at by Government and local authoritiestogether it is even more a question for the Chancellor than for me, despite its implications for the vitality and responsibility of local government. There are some technical questions which might repay expert examination when we can see how the revaluation has gone; but they do not need an independent inquiry andanyway are irrelevant to our present discontents.7. Subject to the views of my colleagues, therefore, 1 would propose to say we reply to the Questions, that I do not believe that an inquiry of the sort suggested would serve any useful purpose for the reason I have mentioned in the previous paragraph. I would add that the question of the proportions in which local expenditure should be met from local and national sources respectively must remain one for the Government, and is not suitable for an inquiry of the sortsuggested; adding, if asked, that the Government have no proposals for altering the proportions at present.8. The one thing I might offer if pressed hard is that I would consider having a factual survey to find out just how heavily the burden of rates does bear on different sections of the community. We ought to know more about this than we do; and the results would serve to set the hardship stories in perspective. I might perhaps add, if my colleagues agree, that tinkering about with the rating system is not the way to relieve hardship among a minority of ratepayers.9. There is a related question, which is that in some areas the revaluation will result in a sizeable increase in the householders&apos; share. In the Rating and ValuationAct 1961 power was taken to derate houses in any county or county borough; thiswas a purely precautionary move. Last spring, when estimates of the new rateablevalues became available, the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (62) 4th Meeting,Item 5) agreed with my predecessor^ proposal that no derating order should bemade; the increases in the householders&apos; share were much smaller than had beenfeared, the highest being 27 per cent in Bournemouth. That has proved to be an over-estimate; the true figure being just over 21 per cent. But though the effect ofrevaluation is thus less than we feared, it coincides in some places particularlyBournemouth with a heavy increase in the rate-call, and the result is a steep rise in rates payable, amounting in a number of individual cases to more than 50 per cent.In fact the N.A.B. could probably help in many of the cases which most deservesympathy if only those concerned would be persuaded to use its services. I shallbe suggesting to the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance that the N.A.B.should seek by suitable measures to persuade potential clients of their rights.10. I am under heavy pressure from Bournemouth and similar towns to makederating orders and it is tempting to see this as the easy way out. Derating houses would increase the burden on other classes of ratepayer in the same area. But itwould be extremely difficult to defend any line once we started on this. Is 15 percent a tolerable increase but 16 per cent not? I am sure that we must stand firm onthis too and I propose to give no ground.K.
