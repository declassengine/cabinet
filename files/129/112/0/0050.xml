Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1963C. (63) 50 Copy No. 52318th March, 1963CABINETMEMBERS&apos; AND MINISTERS&apos; pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterThere has been steady pressure from the Opposition parties for a revisionof Members&apos; pay. The Leader of the Opposition and.the Leader of the liberal party have asked to see the Prime Minister. The subject is also linked with thecurrent public discussion of the reform of Parliament and in last Friday&apos;s debateMembers developed the theme. Most speakers &apos;(no doubt for tactical reasons)concentrated on Ministers&apos; rather than on Members&apos; pay.2. The facts are set out in the Annex. I do not propose to discuss the merits of the case. It seems to me beyond dispute that both Members of Parliament and ministers are underpaid for the work they do and the responsibilities they bear.Only a large increase would meet the case. I would myself think a figure of 3,000 to be fully justified for Members: and if the whole of this were paid to ministers as of right in addition to their Ministerial salary and a change were madein the domicile rule as applied to Ministers, I would consider that justice was doneboth to Ministers and to Members. The cost to the Exchequer would be of theorder of  860,000. I believe that we should move to correct this as soon as it is expedient to do so.  The difficult questions are how and when.3. I see strong political objections to the proposal now attracting wide support in all parties of seeking all-party agreement to a change at the beginning of thenext Parliament. The odium of such an agreement would in fact fall exclusivelyon the Government and would extend over the whole period until the GeneralElection. It would also be objectionable though somewhat less so to take thesimpler course of acting at once. I conclude, therefore, that it would be politicallymost unwise to give any indication now of a move in this field. If the Oppositionwish to make the running we should let them do so and give no ground. We could then handle the matter after the meeting with the Opposition Leaders by means ofa question in Parliament. The reply might be on the lines of &quot; The Governmenthave no intention of bringing such proposals before this Parliament &quot;.I. M.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1,18th March, 1963.2246THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
ANNEXPayment of Members of the House of Commons who are not Ministers is governed by resolution of the House. Members were unpaid until 1912, when they became entitled to draw a salary of  400 a year (taxable). This was increasedto  600 in 1937 and to  1,000 in 1946. A Select Committee reporting in 1954recommended a further increase of  500. Although this recommendation was endorsed by a majority of the House the Government declined to implement it.They did, however, agree to introduce an allowance of  2 a day each sitting dayexcept Friday (amounting to about  280 a year). In .1957 an &quot; additionalremuneration &quot; of  750 was substituted for the  2 a day sessional allowance. AMember&apos;s basic salary remains at  1,000 but he is liable for income tax on histotal emoluments of  1,750.2.  A Member is also allowed:(i) free first-class travel between his home, his constituency and London;(ii) travelling expenses and subsistence allowance when travelling on officialbusiness at the direction of the House.He may claim tax relief against his total emoluments for secretarial, travelling andother expenses connected with his Parliamentary duties, including the additional cost (for a non-London Member) of living away from home when engaged inParlian ^.ntary duties either at Westminster or in his constituency.3 here is no pension scheme for Members but there is a Member&apos;s Fund,to which the Exchequer contribution was recently increased, out of which payments are made under a means test to former Members or their dependants on grounds of need.4. Ministers&apos; salaries are governed by statute. The salaries now paid to thePrime Minister ( 10,000) and to senior Ministers ( 5,000) are those specified in theMinisters of the Crown Act, 1937, and have existed unchanged since 183:1. the salaries of other Ministers (and of the Leader of the Opposition) were increased in 1957, when it was also decided that all Ministers should draw the  750&quot; additional remuneration &quot; payable to Members as a Parliamentary allowance.They may claim tax relief on Parliamentary expenses within this amount in thesame way as other Members, except that all Ministers are assumed to live in London.
