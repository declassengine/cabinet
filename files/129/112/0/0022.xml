Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1963 l:Copy No.   52CABINETLONDON: EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING AND LANDDRAFT WHITE PAPER(Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh Affairs)A White Paper is needed to accompany the Town and Country Planning Bill(which has now been cleared by Legislation Committee) and to explain theGovernment^ new policy on London offices. A statement is also promised on london&apos;s housing and land needs.2. The Committee on Population and Employment decided that it wouldbe right to put all this into a single White Paper since these problems are in factinseparable.3. The attached draft White Paper does this. It was discussed by theCommittee at their meeting on Friday, 15th February, and incorporates the changes they asked to be made.4. On offices, the Paper gives the reasons for the changes in office policy,describes the Bill and also the other aspects of our new policy.5. The Paper says that if London&apos;s needs are to be met over the next10 years half a million new houses, private and public together, will be wanted.These are the needs generated mainly by London&apos;s existing population. We areassuming that a major and successful effort will be made in Scotland and theNorth to reduce the movement of population south.6. The main reason for putting a housing figure into the Paper is to providea basis for the amount of building land that has to be found. I have not undertakenthat this number of houses will be built. That depends on whatever general programme we set ourselves; and I shall be dealing with that in my proposals for future housing policy which I hope shortly to submit to the Cabinet.7. A target of half a million houses for Londoners over 10 years is not however a high one. It represents little improvement over the present buildingrate; with a sixth of the country&apos;s population in the conurbation it would representno more than London&apos;s fair share of a national programme of 300,000 houses ayear. In fact, the programme is, of course, now running above that, with thebalance specifically secured for Scotland and for slum clearance in the North.I could not take any lower figure as the basis for the land to be found.8. There has been speculation in the Press about the green belt, and theWhite Paper sets out our new look at this. The land pressures are so severe thatsome green belt land will probably have to go, but this will amount to very littlein relation to the whole green belt area. It will not mean a radical change inthe approved green belt. I think this holds the right balance between housing and amenity.C.

9. There is aeute pressure on London&apos;s houses; some very high rents arebeing charged for very poor accommodation, and some tenants of private houses are in great anxiety. As my colleagues know, some families are turned out and cannot find new homes. But we do not know the real extent of the distress. nor do we know whether the London housing authorities could not do more for the poorer families if they tried to induce those of their tenants who could fend for themselves to do so.10. I am proposing a factual survey of the use and management of all rentedhouses in London, public and private. The aim will be to see whether betteruse cannot be made of existing housing, and whether we have to envisage some sort of control over exploitation in private housing in conditions of scarcity our only remedy being at present compulsory acquisition. For this we need to getthe facts.11. If the White Paper is approved the intention is to publish it concurrently with the Town and Country Planning Bill as soon as possible.K. .T.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,15th February, 1963.SECRET
Draft White PaperLondon Employment, housing and Land
DRAFT WHITE PAPERLONDON EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING AND LANDINTRODUCTION1. This White Paper is about the problems of employment, housing and land in and around London over the next 10 years. It is concerned primarily with the needs of the built-up area (the conurbation) enclosed by the inneredge of the green belt (when &quot; London &quot; is used without qualification in this paper that is the area intended); and with the impact of these needs on the outer metropolitan area (roughly within 40 miles of Charing Cross) which includesmost of the &quot; commuter &quot; country, the green belt and some of the. new and expanded towns. (Both these areas are shown on the map attached to this paper.)*2. This Paper is concerned with London&apos;s own, immediate, inescapableneeds and problems. It is assumed that a major and successful effort will bemade in Scotland and the North to reduce the movement South.3. But we must in these matters review regularly prospects over a longer term than 10 years so that immediate decisions do not compromise permanentobjectives. That is why the Government recognises that the need to matchjobs, land, transport and housing over the next 20 years in London andSouth-East England calls for a regional plan. Work on this is well advancedand an analysis and provisional conclusions should be published later this year as a basis for discussions with the local planning authorities.4. The regional study is examining the growth and movement of population in the South-East, including over-spill from London, and relatedemployment and transport questions. It will examine the need for a secondgeneration of new and expanded towns which would provide both houses and work for Londoners, well away from London itself, and draw oft&apos; some ofthe pressure on the capital.POPULATION AND employment. Early post-war planning was on the assumption that the level of population and employment in London would be static. It was implicit in theBarlow Report that the level of industrial employment in London could andshould be held down. The tremendous growth in offices, service trades and white collar jobs in industry was not foreseen. Similarly, the AbercrombiePlan assumed that the problem was one of better distribution of the population getting people out of the crowded centre into the ring of countryside aroundit.   It is now overwhelmingly clear that we must not plan for a static London,* Population of conurbation, 1961 8,000,000; Population of outer metropolitan area, 1961-4,250,000.2
6. Population Growth. During the last 10 years, fewer people havebeen moving into the conurbation than have been moving out (many of themto the new and expanded towns, and to areas around London). The net loss by migration amounted to about half a million. But the census showsthat between 1951 and 1961 the population of London fell by less than200,000. This is because, during the same period, there was a naturalI   increase (excess of births over deaths) amounting to 334,000.7. In addition to this, changes in household structure mean that morehouses are needed for a given number of people. The national trend towards the formation of more separate households is strengthened inLondon by people moving in, many of them single persons. Thus, over10 years, up to 10 per cent more dwellings will be needed in London to house the same number of people. Because of this natural increase andchange in the household structure, separate homes will be wanted for atleast 200,000 additional families from the present population of Londonover the next 10 years.8. Employment Growth in London. Growth of employment, as well asgrowth of population, has greatly added to the pressures in London. Sincethe mid-fifties nearly 40,000 new jobs a year have been created in theconurbation. Only about 20 per cent of these were in manufacturing industry; the big increase was in service employment, particularly in officeemployment in central London. There has also been a heavy increase inemployment in the outer metropolitan area. This has meant a steady andpowerful attraction into the area of people from other parts of the countryand the Commonwealth, many of them young people.9. Manufacturing Industry. There has been strict control over industrial expansion in and around London. Industrial development certificates arerarely granted for new projects. Almost all the certificates granted inrecent years have been for extensions which could not be separated from themain factory. Most of these expansions to existing firms have, in fact,taken place in the outer metropolitan area and not in London itself. It willcontinue to be the Governments policy to divert as much of this growth asis reasonably possible to development districts.10. But it has to be recognised that it would be difficult to tightenthese controls much further without damaging the growth of the industries concerned. The area in and around London has a substantial share of thecountry&apos;s dynamic industries and their vitality is important to nationalprosperity. It would be unrealistic to think that employment growth in and around London can or should be prevented altogether. Large-scale removalof existing concerns is certainly impracticable.Offices11. The office growth that has taken place since the war has addedmore than anything else to the employment capacity of the City and theWest End. (Details in Appendix 1.) In addition to an increase of 30 percent (25 million sq. ft.), over pre-war floor space, over 18 million sq. ft. of office floor space is under construction or has received planning permission.SECRET2112 A 2
12. Each year new floor space is being provided for at least 15,000 newoffice jobs in the central area alone. In a decade, 150,000 people have been added to the daily peak-hour travel into central London. Left to itself thistrend seems certain, on present evidence, to continue for several years atleast.13. There is a conflict of interests here. Business, banking and commerceare of the greatest importance to the national economy and are increasinglytaking up a larger share of the working population. London is overwhelminglythe centre for these; and will go on being so. More offices will be needed inLondon if these services are to function efficiently and under modern conditions.14. At the same time the heavy growth and concentration of offices in central London is bringing formidable transport, housing and financial problems in its wake and these affect the lives of every Londoner.15. The housing and transport implications of this are closely linked.In the built-up central and inner suburban areas of London the possibilityof net increase in the numbers of new houses is very limited. Houses forthe bulk of the additional office employees must be found further out.Travel from these areas must in the main be by suburban railway lines;public road transport over the distances involved cannot make a significantimpact on the numbers, and private cars choke the roads. Even allowing for all the improvements that have taken place or are now planned, the capacity which can be provided on the existing lines, short of major andextremely expensive new capital works, will be exhausted in a few years ifthe present rate of increase in employment in central London continues.Further staggering of office hours, valuable though it would be, cannot dealwith the full scale of the problem.The Proposed Office Policy16. The Government believe that more effective steps must now betaken to influence the future rate and distribution of office growth. The rateof growth in the centre must be checked and offices must be better distributedover London as a whole and further afield.17. They have considered whether new office development should be controlled by a system of licences for new building, similar to that employed for industrial development. The machinery for controlling the issue ofindustrial development certificates, however, depends on knowledge of the firm which occupies the factory and on being able to judge the need forthat firm to carry out its manufacture in a particular area. Many new factories are purpose built and have heavy machinery installed; occupiersdo not change often.18. New office blocks, on the other hand, are more often than not builtfor letting; this is, indeed, often the only way in which modern accommodationcan be provided in units of a suitable size for small and medium sized firmsConsequently, when the developer seeks planning permission he may not know how many tenants he will have or who his tenants will be; and thesetenants may change at frequent intervals. A Government Department trying to administer a control of this sort would, therefore, be without the basic4
yrngtasicAs subsequently amended by the Town and Country Planning Acts of 1951 and1954, and consolidated in the Town and Country Planning Act 1962.information needed for the purpose. But even when a tenant was knownit would be extremely difficult to judge the case put forward in support of an office in the central area by a commercial or professional firm. TheGovernment do not believe that it would be practical to administer asystem of control of office occupation either effectively or equitably.    .19.  The Government intend to tackle the office problem in the followingway:(a) to make planning control over new office building still more effective;(b) to get as much Government work done outside central London aspossible;(c) to encourage the provision of more office centres outside the heart ofLondon, including places right away from London;(d) to make a major effort to dissuade private employers from opening newoffices, or extending their present ones in central London; and to persuade employers already there to decentralise work which is not clearly tied to London.20. More Effective Control. Though planning control has beenprogressively tightened by means of amendments to the Development plan for the County of London, it has nevertheless been impossible for the LondonCounty Council to keep office development within reasonable limits. Thisis mainly because they have been handicapped by serious doubts about theirliabilities for compensation under planning law. The matter is a complicatedone; but broadly speaking, the provisions in the Third Schedule to the Townand Country Planning Act 1947* which gave a marginal tolerance of 10 percent in cubic capacity to owners rebuilding their premises, often make itimpossible for a local planning authority to prevent, without risk of payingheavy compensation, disproportionate increases in floor space (and therefore in employment potential).21. The Government consider that these doubts must be removed andthey are introducing legislation for this purpose immediately. If the new Billis approved by Parliament, it will take effect from to-day&apos;s date. development for which planning permission has already been granted will not be affected.[Further details in the Appendix.]22. It is not the intention to prevent all further office growth in central london, but to give local planning authorities (and the Minister of housing and Local Government on appeal) greater freedom to come to sensibledecisions. The Bill will apply to the whole country because the provisionsbeing clarified are part of the general planning law; but obviously the planning authorities will not restrain the size of proposed offices unless there is clearneed to do so.23. Government Dispersal. Over three-quarters of the Civil Service workin regional and local offices. It has for many years been the government&apos;s policy to disperse Headquarters Departments and self-contained Brancheswhich could function away from London without loss of administrative
efficiency. The Headquarters staff totals 125,000. Some 25,000 (20 per cent)of these already work outside London and there are plans to move another7,000. But the time has come for a thorough re-examination of existing plans.The Government have, therefore, asked Sir Gilbert Flemming (formerlyPermanent Secretary to the Ministry of Education) to undertake a completereview of headquarters Civil Service staff in London, and to consider what further work could be undertaken elsewhere.24. A Better Distribution. Clearly, a good deal of office work can becarried out away from central London, with positive benefits in cost and efficiency. Experience shows that many large firms who must keep a head office there can successfully transfer the more routine work to places outside london where rents and rates are lower, where the competition for staff is less fierce and living, working and travelling conditions for all concerned are far more pleasant. There may be others who can move out of Londonaltogether. The disadvantages of congestion at the centre are only tooobvious in terms of rising costs and loss of time to both employers and staff.25. Regions with unemployment should benefit from the diversion ofsome of this employment. Some of the Governments own most successfuldecentralisation moves have been to northern towns. There is no reason why some commercial office development should not go there with equalsuccess.26. But the great majority of firms will not be willing or able to go asfar afield as this. Much office work is tied to the banking and commerce ofLondon, and to the port. For many firms it will be a question of transferringwork which still needs to be within reasonable distance of Head Offices in central London. But any move even a short distance move helps thetransport and housing problems. An office worker at one of the excellentnew centres growing on the periphery of London for example, Croydon,Watford, Surbiton, Ilford makes virtually no demand on the overcrowdedtubes and central area buses; and he can find his home further out than thecentral London worker, thus avoiding areas where pressure on housing land and prices is greatest. Centres such as these, chosen with an eye to bothtransport and land, will provide for the firms which must remain withinshort distance of central London. Discussions on a greater provision ofthese will shortly be started with the planning authorities concerned.27. Other office centres must be developed further afield. Some officefloorspace has been, or is being, built already in the London new towns and: in towns like Norwich, Reading and many others. Expansion of some of thelarger towns will create the right conditions for the dispersal of offices from london.28. Location of Offices Bureau. It is not easy for management Iconsidering a move to get all the facts on which to base their decision. The) I need to know what conditions would be like in particular areas whefholoffices are already available or being built, what the rents are, whether stallcan be recruited locally, how transferred staff can find homes and so on.   I29. Furthermore, not all managements are in a position to foresee th Igeneral situation which is developing in central London as a result of man;!6 I
individual decisions to expand there: how congestion, costs and staffdifficulties can be expected to increase and to affect their own efficiency and working conditions. There is an understandable temptation to defer anuncomfortable analysis of relative costs and benefits; and, of course, the pressures against a move are very real.30. There is need, too, for a central liaison point for all the public authorities who have a part to play in this Government Departments,local authorities, new town corporations and transport authorities and for better and more detailed knowledge of the progress that has been made in office dispersal, the scope for more and the reasons for successes andfailures.31. The Government have, therefore, decided to set up a Bureau tomeet these needs. The Bureau will see to it that the facts are brought tothe notice of firms with offices in central London and that managements andstaffs (particularly in the larger concerns) are encouraged to consider thepossibility of some dispersal to other areas. The Bureau will not, of course,act as a property agency.Conclusions on Employment32. The rate of industrial growth in and around London must continueto be controlled. Office concentration in the centre must be checked; the improved planning control resulting from the new legislation will help todo this. So will the Location of Offices Bureau and the provision of moreoffice centres elsewhere. Even so, in the long term, continuing growth ofemployment, though at a slower rate, must be accepted and planned for.This growth is an organic part of London and must be accepted as anessential element in realistic plans for housing, land and transport.HOUSING33. There are now roughly 2\ million dwellings in London-two-fifthsowner occupied, two-fifths privately rented and one-fifth owned by localauthorities. Practically all the 40,000 slums declared unfit in 1955 have been cleared. Tens of thousands of new houses have been built to replace thosedemolished.34. Since the 1951 census the gap between households and families hasbeen reduced to less than half, and 300,000 additional dwellings have beenprovided.35. For the poorer families the local authorities&apos; stock is steadily increasing. London local authorities own close on 550,000 dwellings. Ifthe new and expanded towns are taken into consideration, the pool availablefor letting by public authorities amounts to 635,000 and this number is increasing every year. The number of local authority houses available forre-letting each year in London itself is now about 10,500.36. There is still however a serious shortage of houses, and too manyLondoners are still living in badly overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.There is also the difficult and poignant problem of the homeless. Though,in relation to the general housing picture, a relatively small number of people7
are affected it is still urgently necessary to relieve the acute difficulties andanxieties of the families concerned, many of them with young children, not enough.money to pay the high London rents and unable to get on to localauthority priority lists.New Housing37. A big housebuilding programme for Londoners must have three main aims to do away with the present shortage of houses, to meet theneeds of London&apos;s natural increase and to provide for the replacement ofhouses lost through redevelopment.38. Shortage. The housing shortage of 350,000 dwellings which existed in 1951 has been more than halved. In spite of this achievement there remains a shortage of 150,000 dwellings to be dealt with.39;^ Natural Increase. At least 200,000 more houses will be needed tomeet the natural increase and growth in the number of households inLondon. This is the smallest figure that can safely be taken and may well prove to be too low.40. Replacements. In contrast with many northern cities the slum clearance problem in London is not a big one. Over the next 10 years between 40,000 and 50,000 slums will be cleared. New dwellings will be built in their place. Elsewhere in London, houses will be pulled down tomake way for new or widened roads, schools, technical colleges and a great variety of other uses. All told, about 150,000 homes will be needed for replacement purposes.41. If all these needs are to be met over the next 10 years half a millionnew houses will be wanted. This is the number to meet the needs generatedinside London itself. There will, of course, be additional housing demands to be met in the outer metropolitan area stemming from its own vigorousgrowth and from the housing needs of people drawn to the area. That side ofthe problem is being considered in the South-East Study.42. The prospects of meeting these needs over that period depends first and foremost on land. There will, of course, also be the question of the overalldemands on the building industry. That is a separate and subsequent problem,not peculiar to London and it is being examined elsewhere. This Paperconcentrates on the land requirements, without which the building industrycannot attempt to gear itself for the productivity needed.43. But, of course, it takes time to clear, acquire and service land, andthe full effect of fresh land allocations will be felt in live to 10 years from now. But the pace of housing should soon start to quicken; and from1968 onwards, there should be a marked improvement in the housing position.Existing Housing44. More housing must make the main contribution to improving theposition in London. But meanwhile some acute problems arise in the use and management of existing houses and in the pressures being experienced bysome families, resulting in homelessness.8
45.  Homeless families have risen in number over the past year or so to between 900 and 1,000. With their big waiting lists and other commitments&quot;the London authorities are limited in the help they can give to rehousingthese families. The London County Council have, however, taken specialaction by buying up empty properties; and also by erecting a large number of temporary mobile dwellings with the aid of Exchequer subsidy. housing associations have also been able to help. The impact of these measures willbe increasingly felt over the next year or so.46. Improvements. A major problem is to secure the improvement ofexisting properties, many of them old-fashioned, cramped and without adequatesanitary facilities. In the private sector in London there are about a millionprivately rented dwellings of which about 40 per cent are still rent-controlled.Many are lacking in modern amenities and urgently need to be improved. Oneof the most difficult problems in London is the modernisation of old tenementblocks in which some of the worst living conditions are to be found. Here,with the aid of increased Exchequer grants, the London County Council andother authorities and the big housing trusts, are improving the blocks theyown, while a start has also been made on getting similar schemes ofimprovement carried out in privately-owned blocks.47. But the rate and scale of improvement need to be stepped up, and improvement grants policy is being examined to see how this can best bebrought about.48. Survey of Existing Housing. What can be done to help thosefamilies living in bad and overcrowded conditions while new houses and improvements are being pushed ahead? In the short term this is a problemof letting policies and priorities making the best possible use of existinghousing in conditions of scarcity. Three-fifths of the houses in London are either privately rented or owned by local authorities, but very little information is available on the way in which this accommodation is being used and managed. Complaints are made of unfair pressure on the tenants of someprivate houses; but to what extent this is happening is not known. It maybe that more could be done to relieve some of the hardship experiencedby a section of Londoners by a better use of existing housing. Some of thelocal authority houses are occupied by tenants who could, perhaps, fendfor themselves and should be encouraged to do so and thus make way forfamilies who have to look to the local authorities.49. The Government propose accordingly to arrange for a survey of housing to be carried out in the Greater London area; and they think thatit would be most satisfactory if this survey were to be conducted by anindependent committee asked to report on the state of housing in Londonand in particular whether, given the scarcity, rented housing is being used and managed to the best advantage. The Government will ask the housing authorities to co-operate in this work and will consult them on the membership of the committee and on its terms of reference. The survey should coverpublicly provided housing as well as private; for the object must be to makethe best use, especially in the interests of those least able to provide for themselves, of all the housing that is or can be made available. TheCommittee will be asked to report as quickly as possible.9
i :   50;   Compulsory: Acquisition. It remains open to local authorities tomake compulsory purchase orders to protect tenants who are in danger ofbeing made homeless under threat of exorbitant rents.   It seems clear thatthere are some cases of this kind which do not come to the notice of theauthorities; and it may be that social workers could do more to bring badcases to notice.   The authorities, for their part must, when considering whether to make orders, take a realistic view about rent levels.   A numberof orders have been rejected because authorities have failed to recognise the changes in value over the last 25 years.   Private landlords are entitledto charge a fair rent, though they are expected in return to carry out theinobligations in regard to maintenance and repair.   Tenants who cannot pay!a fair rent must look to the public authorities, and tenants cannot reasonably!expect private landlords to subsidise them though a good landlord wilEextend consideration to tenants of long standing, unable to pay a fair ren!Bin present circumstances; and many have done so.  The case for compulsory!purchase arises where a landlord is manifestly exploiting the scarcity, and ftenants are in consequence at risk of losing their homes.   The Minister will Inot hesitate to support authorities in compulsory purchase where this canbe shown.Conclusions on Housing51. If half a million houses can be built for London, this should during 8the next 10 years do away with the present housing shortage, enable th Islums to be cleared, and meet the needs of a growing London. A drive oi jimprovements to rented houses is essential and grant policy is being reviewec!with this in mind. An independent and factual examination of the hardshif Iproblem in relation to the use and management of existing houses is needed and is being set up. Meanwhile where manifest exploitation can be showithere may well be a case for compulsory purchase.LAND52. Even to maintain the present output of houses for Londoners wilbe very difficult unless more land can be allocated for building in the riglplaces. The present rate of house-building for London is running at abon47,000 houses a year from all sources public and private building in Londonnew and expanded towns, conversions in London and private housing in thouter areas for people moving out of London but continuing to work there. 53. London land needs can only be met in three ways: and each oneothem has an essential part to play.(i) As many additional houses as possible must be built inside Londoi(ii) Homes must be found in new and expanded towns for Londoners whcan take employment there.(iii) For those whose work ties them to London, and cannot find a homin the capital, land must be provided within reasonable travellindistance of their employment.54. In London: In the absence (until 1965) of a single authorilable to make a detailed survey of the potential capacity of the whoi10
of London and with the power to plan ways and means of increasing that capacity, any estimate must be rough. When the Greater London councils set up they will be able to assess the position more exactly, and almost certainly they should be able to improve on this estimate. Clearly, unifiedplanning control with the opportunity and resources to embark on bigcomprehensive schemes of redevelopment and renewal will mean a more intensive and economic use of land. With high standards of design and planning an imaginative and modern London should emerge to serve theneeds of the second half of the twentieth century.55. The best estimate that can be made at present, however, afterdiscussions with all the planning authorities concerned, is that over the next10 years about 250,000 dwellings (including 100,000 extra dwellings) couldbe provided in London itself by using such building land as there is, byre-allocation of land at present used for non-residential purposes, by increaseddensities (as provided for in the recent review of the County of Londondevelopment plan) and by conversions. Much of this depends on getting holdof land for redevelopment, especially where densities can be increased.56. There are some measures in hand which may add to this total.Already it has been decided to allow some building at Croydon Airport; theLondon County Council hope to carry out a major development on ErithMarshes; further development may be possible at Woolwich Arsenal; andit has been agreed to clear the Government depot at Kidbrooke to allow large-scale housing there. These projects may be expected to produce some 1,500acres, some of which can be developed at once, and most of which will produce more houses later on; others are under consideration.57. In addition, discussions are proceeding with the British RailwayBoard on the use of surplus railway land in London. The intention is thata constructive and balanced programme should be prepared for thedevelopment of this railway land. The outcome should be several thousandnew dwellings for Londoners.58. Dispersal. Dispersal of both population and employment right away from London must be an important objective in the overall strategy ofproviding for London&apos;s needs. The scale on which it will be needed and theextent to which it can be considered practicable cannot be established untilthe South-East Study is completed. But it could not begin to providesubstantial relief until towards the end of the period.59. In the meantime the present new and expanded towns will make a valuable contribution. Over the next five years they should produce nearly40,000 houses, mainly for. Londoners. Though most of the new towns will then bs approaching their, target populations, they may well have more tooffer. The New Town Corporations for Stevenage and Harlow. have beenasked to examine the possibility of further expansions. The question is also being considered whether any of the other London new towns could growbigger than has so far been envisaged. Possibly as many as 40,000 more ofthe houses needed may be got in this way, some of them built by privateenterprise.60. But it is already clear that dispersal by itself cannot be the answerfor all the additional housing needed by Londoners over and above what canbe provided within the conurbation itself.   London is able to provide land11
for only about 250,000 houses in the next 10 years (a net gain of 100,000houses). Allowing for the contribution that can be made by the existing new and expanded towns, we are left with the need (allowing a reasonable margin;to find land around London for about 200,000 houses.61. Around London. In trying to find land for this number of houseswe have to bear in mind that the outer areas are generating their own needs-they are in fact particularly vigorous growth areas. We also have to relateland and transport capacity, which is one of the main factors limiting thechoices available to us. Moreover, a reasonable margin for elbow room andchoice must be allowed and, as far as possible, the needs of both public and private housing provided for.62. Local planning authorities will have to consider how all these demandsare to be met. Much can be done in areas outside the green belt altogether,and by modest expansion of towns and of some villages inside the green beltand its extensions. A detailed analysis of the related housing, employment and transport problems in this whole area is being made as part of theSouth-East Study.: 63. Though the local planning authorities for these areas have already made extensive allocations of building land it is clear that a good deal morewill be needed, particularly in some sectors. In the short term the choice of areas is limited; land must be provided where there is spare capacity on thesuburban railway lines, or where it can readily be provided. The pattern isuneven. South of the river there is comparatively little spare railway capacity:to the north particularly in parts of Hertfordshire and Essex there are lines which can take more travellers, with the possibility of further increases.The Metropolitan Green Belt64. The Government believe that the green belt should remain a permanent feature of the planning policy for London. They will maintain the approvedgreen belt without substantial change, and they will make extensive additions to it. They believe that, with the co-operation of the local planning authorities,enough land can be provided within range of London without damage to the structure of the green belt.65. But the green belt covers 850 square miles, and the extensionsproposed by the local planning authorities would increase it to nearly 2,000square miles. Not all of this is essential to the purposes of the green belt nothas it all high amenity value. It cannot reasonably be maintained that none of this land should be considered for development, however serious the housingshortage may be and whatever this may mean in terms of hardship. TheGovernment feel it inevitable in the light of the land demands that have to bemet that some changes may have to be considered. Any modifications whicimay be necessary are likely to be smallin relation to the whole area of fhtapproved green belt; and should, in the main, be on land with little amenit)value. There is no question of allowing development on the fine countrysidewhich forms an important part of the green belt.66. They do not propose to allow &quot; nibbling&quot; into the belt; a monselective approach is needed. The intention is that the planning authorilieithemselves should be,asked initially to choose the additional areas for housinfAny proposals put forward would be the subject of a public local inquiry..12
67. An area which may be in question is in the Lea Valley where a gooddeal of land is covered or surrounded by glasshouses. Some of the horticultural use is declining and some of the greenhouses derelict. In theGovernments view there are definite possibilities here which ought to be examined; and they intend to ask the London County Council, as an authority which can represent the case for more housing land for London, to do this with the local planning authorities concerned (the Hertfordshire and EssexCounty Councils).68. The Government propose to strengthen the approved green belt by adding substantially to it: but the size and boundaries of these additions cannotbe settled at this stage.Conclusions on Land69. More land must be found for London housing over the next 10 years.Dispersal of work and population will be an essential ingredient in this. Butdispersal by itself cannot meet the need. Since the amount of land whichLondon itself can provide is limited, a good deal of land has to be found forLondoners in the outer areas, over and above local needs. It should bepossible to find most of this land outside the approved green belt, and such changes as may be necessary should not affect it substantially.SUMMARYEmployment(. A more effective planning control of office growth is necessary. Thiswill be made possible by the provisions of the Town and country planning Bill.2. A better distribution of office employment is desirable and the Bill,the Location of Offices Bureau and the provision of office centresoutside central London should help to achieve this.Housing3. If London&apos;s needs are to be met at least half a million houses arewanted over the next 10 years and a further drive on improvements.4. A survey of the use and management of rented accommodation inLondon is proposed so that the possibility of making better use ofexisting housing can be fully examined.Land5. The South-East Study, now nearing completion, will lead to a regional plan in the course of which a second generation of new and expanded towns will be considered.6. Effective action to meet London&apos;s housing needs depends primarily on finding suitable land outside London itself.   :7. Much of the land needed will have to be found in the outer metropolitan area.8. The approved green belt will be maintained without radical change,though some land, not essential to its main purpose, may have to beused for housing.13

In normal circumstances, office building can be satisfactorily controlled by local planning authorities exercising their powers under the Town and country Planning Act, 1947. But special considerations arise when it is aquestion of redeveloping a site on which an office building or a building usedfor offices formerly stood.2. The Third Schedule to the 1947 Act defines the limits of the &quot; existing use rights &quot; of land which are relevant for a number of different purposes.These purposes were connected with the financial aspects of planninglegislation; the Schedule conferred no exemption from the need to obtainplanning permission to carry out development. One of the main originalpurposes of the Schedule, for example, was to define certain tolerances withinwhich development could take place without liability for development charge.These included the right to add 10 per cent to the cubic capacity of a buildingerected before the 1947 Act came into force, either on rebuilding or by wayof addition or enlargement.!3. This causes difficulty when office buildings are redeveloped. Oneconsequence of these and other provisions of planning law is that it isdifficult for a local planning authority to refuse permission for developmentincluding the tolerances without running the risk of incurring, in one way or* These figures relate to a slightly smaller area than the others, but this does not make a significant difference.t The Town and Country Planning Act 1954 extended these rights to buildingserected at later dates.14Appendix 1OFFICES IN CENTRAL LONDONPre-war officesWar damage......Existing, mid-1948   ...Additions, 1948-mid-1962.New building     ............      35-5Change of use   ...      ...      ...      ...      10-045-5Less demolitions ...      ...      ...      ...        8-2*Net increase, 1948-mid-1962Total floor space, mid-1962 .i.Increase over pre-war floor space
another, a liability for heavy compensation. In many cases that could arise in practice the position is not free from doubt, because the route to compensation lies through the service of a purchase notice, the outcome ofwhich could not be predicted with certainty; but the risk is there, s.4. Modern building methods lower ceiling heights, frame constructioninstead of load bearing walls and better internal layout have made it possiblefor developers to get more floor space within a given building cube-justhow much will depend on the particular building, but it may well be of theorder of 40 per cent in some cases.5. Until the last 2-3 years much of the new building has been on wardamaged or new sites. Opportunities of this kind are, however, becomingexhausted. Office building activity is now being largely directed toredeveloping existing buildings, and thus the scope there may be withinpresent planning legislation for forcing extra floor space is becoming ofincreasing importance. The London County Council have represented thattheir attempts to restrict the increase of offices in central London arehandicapped by the compensation hazard.6. The Government therefore propose, while leaving within existing userights the 10 per cent tolerance in cubic capacity, to remove any compensationliabilities which may arise when a local planning authority refuse to allow an increase in floor space of more than 10 per cent of the amount devoted toa particular use in the building being replaced. This does not mean thatpermission for any greater increase would automatically be refused; but itwill give the local planning authority (and the Minister on appeal) theopportunity to consider whether an increase of the magnitude proposed is reasonable.7. The preceding paragraphs refer to tolerances on rebuilding; additions to existing buildings remain to be considered. The Government propose thatadditions to buildings erected before the Town and Country Planning Act,1947 came into force should be treated in the same way as buildings beingredeveloped; that is to say, the 10 per cent tolerance in cubic capacity should remain within existing use rights, but subject to the reservation that no rightof compensation will arise if the increase in terms of floor space used for aparticular purpose in the addition, is restricted to 10 per cent of the floorspaceused for that purpose in the building being enlarged.8. So far as buildings erected after the 1st July, 1948 are concerned,however, the Government propose to remove altogether from the definition of existing use rights the right to enlarge a building by 10 per cent. It is,in the Governments view, wrong that a local planning authority or the minister on appeal, having settled the size of a new building, should be compelled toauthorise a 10 per cent increase in its size under threat of compensation as soon as it has been erected.9. These and certain consequential changes are contained in the Townand Country Planning Bill which has been presented to-day. If the Bill is approved by Parliament, the question whether compensation is to be paid,and if so, how much, in consequence of planning decisions made or purchasenotices served from to-day&apos;s date will fall to be considered in accordancewith the provisions of the Bill.15
10. Existing use rights are taken into consideration on the assessment of compensation for compulsory purchase and the new basis will apply wherethe notice to treat is served on or after to-day&apos;s date. The great majoritvof compulsory acquisitions (including, for example, all acquisitions of landnot previously developed) wiil be unaffected by the changes.11. The Bill is of general application (i.e., it does not relate only to office building) and it extends to Scotland.16
