Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1963C (63)34 Copy No.    521st March, 1963CABINETEXTENSION OF THE MILK MARKETING BOARD&apos;SMANUFACTURING INTERESTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the proposal the Economic Policy Committee (E.A. (63) 9th Meeting, Minute 3) hasdiscussed a proposition on which the Minister of Agriculture has been consulted,informally and in confidence, by the Chairman of the Milk Marketing Board. the proposition is that the Board should purchase the creameries of Unigate Ltd. usedfor the manufacture of milk products. The price would be about  20 million.2. The Chairman of the Board consulted the Minister of Agriculture becausethe Board&apos;s bankers have promised finance for the deal on condition that noobjection is raised by the Government.3. If the bankers withdrew, however, the Board could probably still find themoney from other sources. Moreover, the Chairman of the Board has told theMinister of Agriculture that if Unigate Ltd., whose board is divided on this issue,were to resist, his Board would consider making an offer for the whole of their business (balance sheet value  59 million) and then selling off all their interestsapart from the creameries.4. The Board are already in the manufacturing business; they produce16 per cent of United Kingdom output of butter and 7 per cent of United Kingdomoutput of cheese. Unigate Ltd. was formed in 1959 by a merger of United Dairesand Cow &amp; Gate Ltd., and is by far the biggest concern in the British dairy industry,with large interests in the wholesale and retail distribution of milk and groceriesand the manufacture of milk products, baby foods and certain chemical products.It produces 40 per cent of the United Kingdom output of butter and 33 per cent ofthe United Kingdom output of cheese. If the Board buy Unigate&apos;s creameries theywill produce well over half the United Kingdom output of butter (which representsabout 12 per cent of United Kingdom butter consumption) and almost half theUnited Kingdom output of cheese (which is rather less than half of United Kingdomcheese consumption).5. The Minister of Agriculture has no powers to veto the proposed purchase,but it is believed that it would bring the Board within the power of the President ofthe Board of Trade to make a reference to the Monopolies Commission.The Views of Economic Policy committee. Economic Policy Committee are agreed that the Government shouldresist any move by the Milk Marketing Board to make an offer for the wholeof the Unigate business, and would deprecate the use of such a threat in negotiation for the purchase of the creameries. But they are not agreed about that purchase.7. Those who think the balance of advantage lies in not resisting the purchasehave argued as follows:(a) As a matter of general economic policy, we ought to be encouraging theformation of larger industrial and commercial units, and ought not therefore to discourage this one unless there are strong reasons to thecontrary.2179
(b) Milk producers generally wottlS regard this as likely to benefit theirreturns in due course.(c) Agreement to purchase the creameries would escape the criticisms whichmight be made of a take-over against the will of the Unigate board.(d) There was no criticism even of the merger of United Dairies andCow &amp; Gate.(e) The Board would be extending an existing line of their business, notentering a new one.(/) Milk producers elected the Board and, generally, seem to have confidence in it.(g) As the agency for handling milk off the farm, the Board generally enjoysthe respect of both sides of the House.(h) The bankers&apos; judgment suggests that they have confidence in the Board&apos;disability to manage an enlarged manufacturing business.(/) We are in no position to offer a contrary judgment of the Board&apos;s ability.(;&apos;) Having no power of veto, we should stand powerless at the Despatch Boxif an attempt on our part to stop the purchase were challenged.8.   Those Ministers who oppose the purchase have argued as follows:(A:) The extension of the Board&apos;s manufacturing interest would change thenature of their undertaking, and there would be no guarantee that aBoard elected by milk producers would be competent to manage a largemanufacturing business.(/) This might apply with still more force to other statutory Marketing Boards,for whom an example would have been set for entry into manufactureon a large scale.(m) A large extension of the trading functions of a body which has statutory powers to trade with producers&apos; money would call in question our general policy on State trading.(n) The bankers&apos; confidence in the Board&apos;s credit could be attributed to itspossession of those powers.(o) The use of producers&apos; money as security for financing purchase of a private company might be widely resented, as was the use of public money forsuch a transaction by Richard Thomas and Baldwin&apos;s.(p) Competitors might complain that the Board&apos;s powers gave them unfairadvantage, since, although there could be no discrimination in the&apos;priceof milk supplied to manufacturers, the Board might give precedence toits own creameries if supplies were short.(q) The Co-operative Wholesale  Society -would be  one  of the majorcompetitors.   The Express Dairy Company Ltd. and other milkdistributors would also fear the extension of the Board&apos;s scope.(r) There is no manifest advantage in the deal&apos; for- producers or consumers.(s) fHstfte&apos;&apos;^isarJpT6Ve,^e-Sheald^tige the opportunity ^afforded&apos; by the bankersto say so, whatever our formal powers may be.9. &apos; CdnffderitiaTity &apos;pYecluo*6s &quot;consultation -&quot;withthe ^farmers&apos; vfepf esentatives.&apos;&apos;My Committee&quot; regard -&quot;this; as a reason &apos;for se;ekirig confirmation from the+Boafdthat they&apos;at;least:[are Tuily-safiSfied &quot;thfat the?pTopositi&apos;6n ds^&apos;-the&apos;?tiitkrjn%MSu6C$s&apos;interests.&quot;--conclusion to.
