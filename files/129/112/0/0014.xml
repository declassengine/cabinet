M^9ET3^9^B^.^IMI.F^Ll9ILlg^d^MmigJgj^c^SclejiceMy tour of the North East will prevent my attendance at cabinet when discussion is to take place on the memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C.(63) 12) about the proposal to allow a quota ofRussian oil in exchange for firm Russian orders for British ships.   Sincethe matter seems to me of cardinal importance for the proper dischargeof my new duties I hope I may be allowed to put my views before theCabinet.2.      There is no single thing which would do more to improve morale and create employment in the North East in the near future than asubstantial order for ships.     It is in shipbuilding that unemployment ishighest, and most difficult to reach by any of the attempts at diversifica-tion we shall be making.    It will simply not be understood in theHartlepools, Sunderland, the Tyne or the Tees should it become known(and it has already been reported in the Press) that we have turned downan order for ships offered in return for permission to sell*2, 000, 000 tonsof oil in our market.    In the climate of opinion following our exclusion from the Common Market I find it difficult to believe that such action onour part would be supported by public opinion in the light of the more liberal attitude to Russian oil imports by European countries.3.      The prohibition of the import of Russian oil is one of the relatively few arbitrary restrictions on imports of raw materials which has survivedour liberalising policy of recent years.    Its continuation cannot be basedon our opposition to Communism, since our policy is the expansion oftrade with the bloc countries.     It can, therefore, only be justified on thebasis of commercial interest.    It is difficult to see how this view islikely to be sustainable if the consideration is a substantial order for ships.     What is proposed is not even a removal of the prohibition or a straight barter.    It is a relatively modest quota amounting to no more thana year&apos;s increase in our total oil imports.4.      The Minister of Power seeks to justify a continuance of thestatus quo, partly on grounds of our own oil interests, and partly on thebasis of our need to protect employment and investment in the coalindustry.    He also refers to the alleged danger of our losing largershipbuilding orders from free enterprise countries.-1-
5,     Our oil interests are among the most powerful commercial forcesin the world, and are not such, tender plants as to require protection ofany kind.    On the contrary I would have thought it desirable on principle to diversify our sources of supply, and a little competition from russia might even serve to deter companies and producing countries a littlefrom their pricing techniques.6.     Our coal production is, in some measure, in need of protection,but not, I would submit at the expense of shipbuilding.    Protection of asubstantial order it receives from the fuel oil tax, and if the Minister&apos;sother policies are accepted, by guaranteed orders from the electricity supply industry.7.      The argument that lifting the total prohibition on the import ofRussian oil by the concession of a small quota would lose us shipbuildingorders from other sources is at best speculative.    It reminds one ratherof the fable by Aesop of the dog who was induced to drop its real bone byeyeing the somewhat larger reflexion in the water.    A bird, or a ship,in the hand is worth two in the bush.8.     I therefore ask my colleagues to support the President of theBoard of Trade&apos;s request for authority to be able to respond to a Russianinitiative by negotiating for a quota of fuel oil, not exceeding 2 million tons a year for the remaining eighteen months of the present Five-yearTrade Agreement in exchange for substantial orders for our shipbuilders.H.Office of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science, S. W. 1.5th February, 1963-2-CONFIDENT8AL
