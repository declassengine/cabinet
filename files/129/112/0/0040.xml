CHIEF ANTHONY ENAHOROMemorandum by the Lord chancellor have now seen the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum (C. (63) 36)and that impels me to express my disagreement with his argumentand with his conclusions.2.     I know that Gratiaen Q. C. and Dingle Foot Q. C. were refused admission to Nigeria.    Much was made of this in the proceedings before the Divisional Court and the Appeal Committee of the House ofLords.    The Home Secretary quotes a sentence from the Lord chief justice&apos;s judgment.    The full passage reads as follows:-&quot;What this court is concerned to see is whether thereis any danger if this applicant is returned to Nigeria,that he, if he desires a counsel of his choice, willbe refused that counsel in the same terms as chief Awolowo was, namely &quot;because you are coming to defend a particular person in a particularproceeding&quot;.    If I felt that there was a real dangerof that, I should myself hesitate before refusingsome form of relief to this applicant. &quot;The Lord Chief Justice went on to say that on the instructions of the Nigerian Government an undertaking had been given that ifEnahoro chose a Counsel from England who, according to the law of Nigeria, was entitled to appear in a Nigerian court, the executivewould not refuse that Counsel permission to land merely because hewas going to represent the applicant.    The Lord Chief Justicecontinued by pointi ng out that an English barrister was only entitled under Nigerian law to appear in a case if he obtained the authority or warrant of the Chief Justice of Nigeria and said that, if the chief justice did authorise English counsel to appear for the applicant,the Government of Nigeria had now undertaken that Counsel wouldnot be refused entry merely because he was going to appear on the applicants behalf.&quot;That being so&quot; he said, &quot;however oppressive the actionappears to be *- and I am not saying.it was because we have not got the full facts - in depriving Chief Awolowo of his legal representation,I am quite satisfied that if this applicant be returned there will be nooppressive action of that sort taken in this case.&quot;-1-C. (63) 40 COPY NO.  a fa6th March, 1963CABINET
SECRET -       Jjjr3.      The Appeal Committee of the House of Lords also concernedthemselves with this question, and particularly with the fact that, asthe Home Secretary states, the undertaking did not amount to an unqualified assurance that British counsel would be admitted.   Havinglearned that the terms of that undertaking were suggested by the lord chief Justice, the Appeal Committee refused leave to appeal.4,     It is not known whether Enahoro wants British Counsel todefend him.    If he does, I do not think we should assume that the nigerian Government will not honour the undertaking that they havegiven, an undertaking carefully drawn so as not to exclude their right to refuse admission on other grounds, e.g. if the counsel was found to be suffering from an infectious disease, and in terms suggested by the Lord Chief Justice.5.     To refuse to return Enahoro to stand his trial for treasonwhen it is clear that there is strong evidence against him, on theground that he is unlikely to get counsel of his choice (if he wantsBritish counsel) would be to act contrary to the conclusion of theLord Chief Justice and to involve the assumption that the nigerian government will not honour their undertaking.6.      Despite the confidential discussions with Lord Head, I do not feel it is established that they will do so.    I do not think that thereare strong and exceptional reasons for refusing to return Enahoroand if we do return him, I think that we can rely on the conclusion reached by the Lord Chief Justice in the Divisional Court.7.      The Nigerian Bar is some 700 strong and I am informed thatthere are at least half a dozen barristers there who are perfectlycompetent to defend Enahoro on these charges.8.      This leads me to pose the question, what right have we tomake it a condition of Enahoro*s return that he shall have the rightto employ British counsel ?   I can well imagine the indignation inthis country if the return of someone under the Fugitive OffendersAct or the Extradition Act was made conditional on foreign counselbeing given the right of audience in our courts.9.      The Nigerian Act provides that only Nigerians shall have theright of audience in Nigerian courts unless the Chief Justice of nigeria authorises the appearance of a foreign advocate in aparticular case.    It cannot be assumed that the Chief Justice will doso in this case, and for us to make it a condition of Enahoro&apos;s returnthat British counsel  shall have the right of audience is, I think,without precedent and wholly unjustified.10.    In my opinion we should not assume that the nigerian government will not honour the undertaking they have given, nor should we assume that Enahoro will wish to employ British counsel,or that if he does the Chief Justice will agree to that.    In my opinion there are no reasons for supposing that Enahoro will not be capablydefended by Nigerian counsel and no &quot;strong and exceptional reasons&quot;for refusing to return him when the Divisional Court has held that heshould be returned and the Appeal Committee of the House of Lordshave refused leave to Appeal from their decision.11.     For these reasons and those given by the commonwealth secretary in the telegram annexed to C. (63) 37 I am strongly of theopinion that Enahoro should be returned to stand his trial.House of Lords, S. W. 1. D&apos;6th March, 1963 -2-
