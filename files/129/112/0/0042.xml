Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1963C. (63) 42 Copy No.    5 211th March, 1963CABINETEXTENSION OF UNITED KINGDOM FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor at its meeting on 6th February, 1963, the Committee on the Law of the Seaconsidered the timing of the action necessary to achieve the Governments aim ofsecuring the extension of our fishery limits to six miles measured from, in some areas,base lines and bay closing lines drawn in conformity with the 1958 Convention onthe High Seas.2. The Law Officers have advised that we can only extend our fishery limitsby extending the limits of our territorial sea. We have always sought to maintain that a country cannot unilaterally extend its territorial sea, but in recent years therehave been a number of instances where countries have done so and their extensionshave in practice been recognised by other nations.3. In view of the line we have taken in the past, it would seem desirable tosecure the acquiescence of the European countries, of the Commonwealth countries and of the United States. In informing them of our intentions, we should thereforedraw attention to the circumstances which have led to our decision and, inparticular, to the failure to secure a multilateral Convention on the breadth of theterritorial sea.4. It would seem unlikely that we shall be able to secure agreement to thecourse we propose. France, Belgium and Germany all maintain the three-mile limit and France derives many advantages from fishing up to three miles of ourshores, while we derive little if any advantage from being able to fish up to three miles of the French coast.5.   In this connexion our freedom of action is inhibited by two Treaties:(a) The Anglo-French Convention of  1839 and the Regulations made there under in 1843;(b) The North Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882.6. The North Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882 between Germany, Belgium,Denmark, France, the Netherlands and ourselves provides for the policing of theNorth Sea Fisheries outside territorial waters. It provides that the fishermen ofeach country shall enjoy the exclusive right of fishery within the distance of three miles from low water mark.This Convention can be terminated by notice given before the 15th Mayin any year to take effect on the 15th May of the following year.In the opinion of the Law Officers, if we are to extend our limits and to exclude the right of other nations to search and inspect our vessels within our extendedlimits, it is necessary to give notice of termination of this treaty.The urgent question for decision is whether we should do so before the15th May. If we do not, the Treaty can only be terminated at the earliest on the15th May, 1965, and the extension of our fishing limits will be postponed till then.7. The Anglo-French Convention of 1839, to which the Republic of ireland is now a party, falls into two parts. The first deals primarily with the oyster fishingbetween the Island of Jersey and the neighbouring coast of France. The limits ofthe French fisheries to which it applied were amended in 1928 and its provisions2212
were extended in 1951 to the areas of Ecrehous and Minquiers. The second definesand regulates &quot; the limits within which the general right of fishery on all parts of the  coasts of the two countries shall be exclusively reserved to the subjects of GreatBritain and France respectively &quot;. These limits were defined as generally beingthree miles from low water mark.. ij 8. While Article IX of the 1839 Convention might be regarded as imposingan obligation on each Government not to extend its exclusive fishery rights asagainst the other Government, the Attorney-General thinks that it can be argued that the article did no more than reserve to the nationals of each country the exclusive right to fish within the defined limits leaving the right to fish outside thoselimits to be governed by general international law.9. These agreements with the French contain no provision for theirtermination. In the Attorney-GeneraFs opinion, with which I agree, they cannotbe regarded as subject either to an implied right of termination on reasonablenotice or to termination in accordance with the rebus lie stantibus doctrine andthey can therefore only be terminated with the agreement of the FrenchGovernment.10. The Attorney-General is further of the opinion that we could notlawfully extend our limits in the face of the 1843 Regulations. But in the lightof their nature and the past history in relation to them, he thinks that a fairlystrong case could be made out for the view that they are terminable on reasonablenotice and that one year&apos;s notice terminating On the 23rd June in any year wouldbe reasonable notice.11.   The Attorney-General suggests that the only course to follow would be:(a) to give one year&apos;s notice to the French Government terminating the 1843Regulations on the 23rd June, 1964, at the same time as notice is givento terminate the North Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882;(b) to confirm that, while reserving the rights of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin this respect, the notice is not intended to terminate the 1839Convention, the 1928 Agreement regarding the limits of FrenchFisheries in Granville Bay or the 1952 Agreement regarding the rightsof Fisheries in the Ecrehous and Minquiers areas;(c) to give notice of the intention of the United Kingdom to extend itsterritorial sea to six miles from base lines and bay closing lines drawn in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Law of the territorial sea, except possibly in relation to the French fisheries mentioned in(b) above, and in relation to the Island of Jersey and the other channel islands;(d) if challenged by the French on the basis of Article IX of the 1839Convention, to maintain that the United Kingdom is not inhibited bythat Article from extending its territorial sea against all countries,including the French.12. There would not seem much practical advantage in terminating the1882 Treaty if we remain obliged to let the French fish to up to three miles from our coasts. If we do not secure the agreement of the French and act unilaterally,we might be taken by the French before the International Court and in the viewof the Attorney-General there is a serious risk that we would not succeed. Aconsiderable time would elapse before such proceedings were concluded and inall the circumstances it may be thought that it is worth taking the risk that such proceedings might be initiated artd that we might lose.13. Scottish inshore fishermen are pressing hard for extensions on the groundthat the resulting exclusion of foreign fishermen would prevent interference withgear for which they have difficulty in obtaining redress and would enable themmaterially to increase their catches.Deep-sea fishermen argue that an extension by us will encourage othercountries to extend their limits, but it is not possible to determine what weight,if any, should be attached to this argument in the light of. what has happenedoff Iceland and Norway, and the extension to 12 miles off the Faroese andGreenland recently announced by Denmark. Defence and general maritimeconsiderations weigh against a departure from the three miles limit, but an extension to six miles is regarded as being tolerable.
I understand that there would be difficulties about announcing a decision toextend our limits to six miles before the current Faroese negotiations are out ofthe way.14. Action by us now to extend our limits might be regarded as especiallydirected against France, who are the biggest fishers off our coasts, on accountof their conduct in terminating the E.E.C. negotiations. It might also offend theother five Common Market countries who support the three-mile limit and who might regard our action as inconsistent with the conduct of good Europeans.15. On the other hand, it may be doubted whether any better opportunityof taking this action will arise in the future. With the present Frenchunpopularity, our action might be understood by the other five as a necessarystep for the protection of our domestic interests.16. A decision is required as to whether action should be taken before the15th May:(a) on whether to give notice terminating the 1882 Convention; and(b) if so, as to the steps which should be taken.17. If the decision is that we should give this notice, I suggest that thefollowing steps should be taken:(a) At the earliest possible date we should inform the Old commonwealth countries, the Republic of Ireland, the signatories of the 1882Convention, the United States and the other NATO countries of our intentions with a full explanation of the reasons for our decision.We should accompany this with an expression of our wish to continuethe provisions of the 1882 Convention relating to policing of the fisheriesoutside the territorial limits in the North Sea. We would add that wedo not propose to make any changes with regard to the fisheries referredto in paragraph 11 (b) of this paper or with regard to the territorial sea round Jersey and the other Channel Islands.(b) Shortly before the 15th May we would give formal notice to theGovernments concerned to terminate the 1843 Regulations as well asthe 1882 Convention.(c) We should give notice before the 15th May to terminate the 1843Regulations as well as the 1882 Convention and explain that we wish tocontinue the provisions of the 1882 Convention relating to policing ofthe fisheries outside the territorial limits in the North Sea and that wedo not propose to make any changes with regard to the fisheries referredto in paragraph 11 (b) of this paper or with regard to the territorial searound Jersey and the other Channel Islands.(d) The Colonial Office should consider, in consultation with colonial governments, the extent to which the decision to extend the UnitedKingdom&apos;s territorial sea should be claimed for Colonial territories.18. If we take this course, legislation before the 15th May, 1964, will benecessary to complete the process.House of Lords, S.W.1,11th March, 1963.
