CABINETEAST-WEST TRADE DIFFERENCES WITH THE AMERICANSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsVarious points affecting East-West trade on which we are, or may soon, bein conflict with the United States Government are considered in the annexedmemorandum. Since one of them (imports of Soviet oil) is to be considered bythe Cabinet on 7th February, the present paper may be useful in providing a framework for the discussion.2. With the breakdown of the Brussels negotiations there will be pressure from the United Kingdom public and parliamentary opinion in favour ofincreasing our trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc, and consequently still greaterresistance than now to United States policies on the subject. Yet in the aftermathof the Brussels negotiations it will also be an essential part of our general foreignpolicy to strengthen the North Atlantic Alliance and to work as closely aspossible with the United States Government in our trade policies. How fartherefore can we afford to oppose the United States Government simultaneouslyon so considerable a range of problems affecting East-West trade, on some ofwhich we are also out of step with other Governments and with the Alliance asa body?3. On all the points listed in the annex our present position is perfectlydefensible, and our allies should already be well aware that our opinions arelogically and firmly held. But we are constantly on the defensive against UnitedStates initiatives, and although our basic differences have in the past been fullyaired with the United States there might now be advantage in seeking talks withthem once more on this subject. They appear still to be acting on the assumptionthat, if they go on exerting pressure on us long enough, we will cave in; and theyhave disregarded the opportunities they are giving the Russians of fomentingtrouble between us and our allies. In order, however, to reduce the heat which any confrontation on this subject is bound to engender, it might be wiser to includeit in a more general discussion on international economic policies, in which wecan point to a wide identity of interest with the United States Government on thereally big issues.4. Of the individual issues, two ((a) imports of Soviet oil and (c) exports oflarge-diameter pipe) are almost certain to engender continued friction; two more((e) aircraft for China and (g) Cuba) are potentially difficult but offer some room for manoeuvre; in two others ((b) long-term credits for the bloc and (d) the LeipzigFair) adjustments in our policy which could reduce friction might usefully bemade; and in the other two cases ((/) civil aviation and (h) Berlin counter-measures)the difficulties are quiescent.5.   My conclusions on these points are:(a) Imports of Soviet OilWe no longer have to consider the need to harmonise our importpolicy with that of the Six; but caution is necessary here, as not onlyAnglo-United States relations (and relations between the UnitedKingdom and the North Atlantic Alliance) are at stake but also ourTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1963C. (63) 13 Copy No.    524th February, 1963
relations with Middle Eastern and other oil-producing countries. the quota for Soviet oil should only be given for a sizeable return, e.g., on condition that substantial orders for ships are received.(b) Long-term Credits for Soviet BlocAn informal approach has been made by representatives of theEuropean Economic Community that we and the Community should enter into a gentleman&apos;s agreement not to extend to the bloc credits inexcess of five years. We should work towards this agreement. If theBrooke Marine order is concluded on the basis of a six-year financialguarantee, this should be treated as an exceptional prior commitment.We should in future consult with the Six before again exceeding fiveyears, and consider this only when necessary to match our competitors&apos;terms. Japanese co-operation should be sought for the suggestedgentleman&apos;s agreement.(c) Large Diameter PipeThe present state of the steel industry makes it undesirable to discourage the acceptance of orders for pipe from the Soviet Union,even if we wished to go back on our stated policy. We should continueto allow our firms freedom, and maintain our present attitude in NATOand towards the proposed action in Co-ordinating Committee (COCOM).(d) Leipzig FairThe Board of Trade subsidy to the Federation of British Industries(F.B.I.) should be discontinued and the F.B.I. should be urged towithdraw.(e) Aircraft for china the Viscounts order should proceed as planned and, since the indian government are not expecting us to renounce the order, their agreement should be sought to delivery of the Viscounts by the normal route viaDelhi. The proposed British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC)sale of secondhand Britannias should be discouraged for the time being.(/) Civil AviationNo change of policy is desirable.ig) CubaSubject to the outcome of current discussions in Washington, nochange of policy seems necessary. Non-Woe trade with Cuba is declining in any case. The risk of United States aid to United KingdomColonies being affected is probably not great but cannot be discounted.(h) Berlin Economic Counter-measuresWe have real differences of opinion with the United States whichare not pressing so long as tension over Berlin remains relaxed; and nochange of policy is desirable.5.   It is recommended:(a) that the Cabinet should endorse the recommendations on the various pointsas set out above;(b) that an opportunity should be sought, preferably as part of a widerdiscussion on international economic policies, for discussing bilaterallywith the United States Administration the whole question of economic policy towards the Soviet bloc in order to persuade them not to pressus on those matters such as pipe and oil on which public opinion in theUnited Kingdom is strong.H.Foreign Office, S.Wi&quot;U4th February, 1963.
ANNEX(a) Imports of Soviet oil the Cabinet will consider on 7th February a proposal, strongly backed bythe President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Transport, that her majesty&apos;s Government should agree to take an annual quota of up to 2 million tons of Soviet fuel oil in return for large orders for ships. The ships in whichthe Russians have shown interest are valued at anything from  14 million to 80 million. Negotiations are furthest advanced with Brooke Marine of Lowestoftfor eight fish factory ships worth  12 million and Simons-Lobnitz of the Clydefor 3-20 dredgers worth  2- 12 million.2. The proposal to import oil is very strongly opposed by the Minister of power. Apart from arguments based on fuel policy (both oil and coal) hemaintains that the fact that part of the future market for oil in this country wouldbe supplied by Russian oil is bound to act as a deterrent to the oil companies(particularly those which are owned by the United States) in considering plans for expanding refinery capacity in this country and the tankers which go with it.The United States Government will probably object not only to our taking oil butalso to our selling ships to the Soviet Union; although there can be no justification for objection if no tankers are involved.(b) Long-term Credits and Financial Guarantees for the Soviet Bloc3. With certain unimportant exceptions, no member of NATO has yetextended a commercial credit to the Soviet bloc for longer than five years. Anumber of member Governments, however, informed NATO in reply to a questionnaire circulated last summer that they made no distinction between the bloc and the rest of the world in the extension of credits of over five years, andthus (by implication at least) that they held themselves free to offer over fiveyears&apos; credit to the bloc in certain circumstances.4. The United Kingdom reply to the questionnaire took the same line. we made it clear that there was no reason in principle why we should not offer to the bloc, as we do to other buyers, credits of up to seven years for ships and large jet aircraft, and that our system of financial guarantees was also applicable to the bloc.5. The United States line is to oppose the extension of long-term credits tothe bloc, and they may also be expected to disapprove strongly if we issue a financial guarantee in respect of an export to a bloc country. In addition, the Sixhave recently suggested that we and they should agree to restrict credits to the bloc to five years. We may therefore expect reactions of varying degrees ofdisapproval from the United States and the Six, if a United Kingdom firm securesan order from the bloc by offering more than five years&apos; credit. There is a distinctpossibility of this in the near future, since it has been agreed by departments here that Brooke Marine (see paragraph 1 above) should be authorised to offer six years&apos; credit to the Russians for the fish factory ships. Moreover, Brooke Marinehave since asked us for a financial guarantee because they have not the resources to finance the contract themselves. Since the extension of a financial guarantee to Brooke Marine would not affect the length of credit offered to the Russians,and it is really irrelevant, whatever our critics may say, whether credit should beextended by means of a financial guarantee or a suppliers&apos; credit, we haveacquiesced.(c) Large Diameter Pipe for the Soviet Union6. We are under heavy pressure from the United States and Federal german governments to take further action to stop exports to the bloc of large diameterpipe and, in particular, to agree to a resolution in the COCOM Committee on thelines of the decision adopted in NATO in November in the face of an explicitUnited Kingdom reservation. The object of this latter proposal appears to be toenable the United States Government to exercise more pressure on the japanese and perhaps the Swedes. However, we learned on 29th January that the JapaneseGovernment have now decided to impose no legal restriction on exports of pipe;and the Swedes to whom we have made known our present policy, appear to take2059a I
4SECRETthe same line as we do. We have made it clear to the Americans, and have instructed our Delegation to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (O.E.C.D.), that we must oppose the COCOM proposal anda fortiori of course the addition of such pipe to the COCOM List, which theGermans have mooted.7. Hitherto we have been able to say that United Kingdom firms have had noorders for such pipe. But a few weeks ago the firm of Whessoe, whose works areat Darlington, asked the Board of Trade whether they would be permitted to import 200,000 tons of Soviet steel plate for conversion into 30-in. pipe.Subsequently their representative has visited Moscow and offered the Russians upto 150,000 tons of 40-in. pipe to be made from British steel. Such an order wouldbe worth several million pounds (although  300 per ton quoted in Moscowtelegram No. 103 seems much too high). It is not clear whether this offer isintended to replace or to supplement the contracts for 200,000 tons worth 10 million placed by the Soviet authorities in October 1962 with three WestGerman firms, the fulfilment of which the Federal Government are now intending to forbid. But, in any event, the news that a United Kingdom firm had secured a Soviet contract for this material would undoubtedly provoke a strong reaction from the Americans and also from those of our NATO allies who conceived thatthe order had been &quot; stolen &quot; from their industries.(d) Leipzig Fair8. The Americans and Germans are impressed by the political advantages which the East Germans derive from the Leipzig Fair, and in particular fromexploiting the participation of numerous British firms and of the Federation ofBritish Industries, who organise and co-ordinate their exhibits. The UnitedKingdom is the most important participant after the Federal Republic. TheForeign Office view is that the political disadvantages of F.B.I. participation in the fair do indeed outweigh the commercial advantages. They have therefore urged the Board of Trade to agree that the F.B.I. should withdraw, and that a small, andso far confidential, subsidy which the Board of Trade give the F.B.I. to assist themorganise United Kingdom commercial representation at Leipzig should also be withdrawn.  The President of the Board of Trade has resisted this.9. So far we have had no direct representations from the United StatesGovernment on the subject (United States views have been made known in NATO)but they are certainly watching our attitude closely.10. Policy towards the 1963 Spring Fair at Leipzig is at present underconsideration in NATO, and a situation may develop in which it would bedesirable for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to agree on political grounds to discourage British participation at the Fair more actively and, in particular, to put pressure upon the F.B.I. to withdraw. This is because the Americans and germans are likely to press for a tougher line than NATO agreed to adopt in 1962 and areconscious that the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is an important obstacle to this, both in itself and because it encourages other NATO countries to putforward similar objections.11. Our preliminary instructions to our Delegation in NATO are that theycan accept a NATO decision on the same lines as last year, which the germans have (rather surprisingly) initially proposed; but that their main aim is to expose the German and French positions. In the light of these we can consider how farwe might be prepared to go.(e) Aircraft for China12. Washington telegram No. 29 Saving shows that the United StatesGovernment have raised again the subject of the sale of six Viscount aircraft to china. This contract is worth  4 million for aircraft,  1 million for spares and ^ million for engines. It was concluded in December 1961 and deliveries are dueto take place between July and December 1963. The delivery route was to havebeen via Karachi, Delhi and Rangoon, but the present Indian policy on overflightsgives reason to think that they might not allow overflights for these aircraft.Alternative routes, particularly that via Bahrain, Colombo and Bangkok, are underconsideration, but these involve extra fuel tanks and expense and at least four months&apos; delay.
13. The United States might have been able to prevent the fulfilment of this contract by exploiting the fact that two sorts of equipment installed in the Viscounts(electronic equipment made by Standard Telephones and Cables (S.T.C.), a subsidiary of an American company, and pressurisation equipment made byNormalair under licence from the United States Garrett Corporation) are subjectto United States Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The S.T.C. difficulty has probably been overcome by a strategem adopted in 1961 whereby the equipment is being supplied via B.E.A. and the Ministry of Aviation and not direct to Vickers.The Normalair equipment has already been delivered to Vickers. NeverthelessWashington telegram No. 29 Saving suggests that the Americans may again be considering the application of the Foreign Assets Controls to the Viscounts sale.The subject raises the whole issue of United States control of United kingdom firms through investment or licensing arrangements.14. We inferred from discussion with the State Department in 1961 that theUnited States Administration would turn a blind eye to our finding a way roundtheir Foreign Assets Controls, whilst feeling free to express censure for Americandomestic consumption. The United States now say that this is no longer &quot; a matterof publicity and public relations &quot; though clearly Congress and the Press are muchin their minds. They seem prepared to insist that the Viscounts will be a substantialaddition to Chinese airlift capacity and that supplying them is inconsistent withour sympathy and aid for India, particularly our plan to assist Indian air defence.15. It seems certain that a fortiori they will object even more strongly tofurther sales of civil aircraft to China. They have just enquired about Press reportsthat B.O.A.C. will sell 14 Britannias to China for  150,000 or more each. For thepresent this is a hypothetical question, since the Chinese enquiries have been verytentative.(f) Civil Aviation16. The United States want to hamper the growth of Soviet bloc civil aviation and have formally requested the members of NATO to stop further bloc penetrationin the uncommitted areas of the world. We have opposed this policy as ineffective,often counter-productive and in many cases contrary to our international obligations.It is also our view that civil aviation is a means of fostering contacts both commercial and general with the bloc and so weakening the Iron Curtain. The agreed policyin NATO is that civil aviation agreements with the Soviet bloc should secure asmuch advantage to the West as to the bloc countries concerned. Nevertheless, wehave tried to meet the Americans by agreeing where possible to delay and hinderSoviet bloc civil aviation penetration to sensitive areas.17.   Specifically in the case of Cuba we have agreed to:(a) search aircraft on non-scheduled flights by Chicago Convention bloccountries, i.e., Czechoslovakia and Poland, and also Cuba;(b) refuse transit facilities (including overflights) to bloc countries not partiesto the Chicago Convention, e.g., USSR.We have however declined to interfere with scheduled services by ChicagoConvention bloc countries, e.g., the Czechoslovak and Cuban overflights on theservice: Prague-Shannon-Gander-Havana, which had already been agreed.18.   We are not at present under pressure to change our general attitude.(g) Cuba19. We are being pressed more strongly than ever by the United StatesGovernment to prevent British ships, particularly those on charter to the soviet bloc, from carrying goods to and from Cuba. We have been told that, if we donot do so, the United States Government may be reluctantly obliged to apply to usSection 107 of the Foreign Aid Appropriation Act 1962. The practical effect ofthis could be to cut off all United States aid to British colonies. We have already made clear to the Americans that we are opposed to Governmental interferencewith the freedom of shipping.
(h) Berlin Economic Countermeasures20. The present position is that in a crisis over access to West Berlin the americans would favour the adoption of economic countermeasures, up to and including a full embargo, at a much earlier stage than we are willing to contemplate.We have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of such measures (unlessconcentrated on the D.D.R., which the Americans do not want), and are acutelyaware of their probable effects upon the economic position of this country. Wehave therefore tried to resist attempts to force us into automatic commitments, havestriven to preserve the concept of a graduated scale of measures of increasingseverity, from which a choice could be made at the time; and have insisted that atotal embargo should be reserved for the final stage before all-out hostilities. the americans have recently suggested a review of all our contingency planning andthe question of economic countermeasures is therefore bound to come up again before long.
