HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot;&quot;Si&quot;Cil63L47 COPY NO. m_______12th March, 1963CABINETEX TENSJON OF THE^ U NIT ED KINGDOM&quot; FISHERY&quot;LIMITSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in considering the question of our fishery limits, mycolleagues will wish to know that the Canadian High Commissioner,in the course of a call on me on 27th February, asked me formallywhether Her Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome a new conference to discuss the breadth of the territorial sea and of fishing limits.He explained that Canada was becoming concerned at the size ofthe Russian fishing fleet off her coasts and that any Government inCanada could expect in the near future to face strong demands for action to extend fishery limits.    He added that the Canadian government intended to put a definite proposal for such a conference to theUnited States Government.2.      I am opposed to the Canadian suggestion for the following reasons:-(a) If we proceed with the action we now contemplate we shallbe free to go ahead on 16th May, 1964.    Agreement to callan international conference would entail many months of preparation and could hardly delay our own extension byless than a year.(b) It is extremely unlikely that a fresh conference on the breadth of the territorial sea could achieve any satisfactory resujt.The convention would require a two-thirds majority andour experience, in I960 at the second Geneva Conference onthe Law of the Sea and in 1961 when we carried out soundingsthrough the diplomatic channel, demonstrated that no singleagreed breadth of the territorial sea and of fishery limitscould command the necessary majority.3.      The United States Government are unlikely to welcome such aconference.    They refused to participate in the soundings carriedout through the diplomatic channel because they foresaw no prospectof success and feared an aggravation of the trend towards the12-mile territorial sea.4.      I invite my colleagues to agree that we should inform theCanadian Government that we consider that no useful purpose wouldbe served by convening a further conference on the breadth of theterritorial sea.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.12th March, 1963
