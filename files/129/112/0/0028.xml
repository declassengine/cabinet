CABINETMESSRS. SHORT BROTHERS AND HARLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the importance of Shorts to the economy of Northern Ireland, the politicalbackground, and the reliance placed in Northern Ireland on Government assurances that all practical steps would be taken to maintain the firm as a fully balancedaircraft design and production unit, were described in paragraphs 6-9 of thememorandum submitted to Cabinet by the Minister of Defence and the Minister of aviation on 2nd October, 1962 (C. (62) 144). Recently the hopes of Shorts haverested on securing the order for the aircraft to replace the Hastings and Beverley,and the importance attached to securing the new contract has been reflected in the pressure applied by Northern Ireland Members of Parliament for an early announcement of a decision on this matter.2. The Defence Committee at its meeting on 9th February, 1963, agreed inprinciple that the aircraft to replace the Hastings and Beverley should be designedin terms of OR-351, and I understand that it is proposed to negotiate a project studycontract at once with the Hawker Siddeley group. An announcement of thisdecision will be received with deep dismay in Northern Ireland. The latest figures show that the number of unemployed there is 54,583, no less than 11-2 per cent of the insured employees. Some of the new industrial firms which have beenattracted to Northern Ireland in recent years are at this moment reducing their labour force, and there is great concern there that the adoption of special measuresto help other areas of high unemployment in Britain will have the effect ofdiminishing the relative attraction of Northern Ireland to new industry. Thepresent therefore is a particularly bad time to announce that Shorts are not to getthe new contract. My colleagues will best appreciate it by imagining what the reaction would be if we chose this moment to make such an announcement aboutthe future of one of the two largest factories &apos;in Scotland or the North-East, andthat a Government-owned factory (as Shorts is), working on Government orders.3. I appreciate that the Hawker Siddeley design has been chosen in preference to a variant of the Belfast aircraft on the grounds that it would be both technicallysuperior and cheaper. It will take a great deal however to convince opinion inNorthern Ireland that the alleged shortcomings of the Belfast design do in factoutweigh the consideration that priority should be given in placing new orders toan area with the highest and most persistent unemployment in the United Kingdom.4. A decision not to place the new contract with Shorts will involve the break-up of their design team. If the decision is to stand, it is essential that theNorthern Ireland Government should be informed in advance of any public announcement. In my view it is essential also that the announcement should include a statement of the reasons for selecting the Hawker Siddeley design ratherthan the Shorts design, and of the intention to sub-contract a large part of theproduction work to Shorts. Northern Ireland Ministers have already been told,at a meeting held on 15th October to consider the Report of the Joint Working party on the Economy of Northern Ireland, that if the Hastings/Beverley replacementwere to be built in the United Kingdom a substantial part of the work would belikely to go to Shorts.2136Printed for the Cabinet.

5. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury in his memorandum (C. (63) 24)proposes that a decision in principle should now be taken that, subject to consultation with the Northern Ireland Government, the Shorts site should beredeveloped, with the necessary Government assistance, as a trading estate andthat Shorts should in due course cease to manufacture aircraft. Even if it becomes necessary, in spite of the grave political difficulties, to accept that we may haveto contemplate the eventual closure of Shorts, I would be strongly opposed to taking any decision in principle before we have any assessment of the implications of the proposal to redevelop the site as a trading estate. Such an assessment wouldhave to cover the finances of the operation, the running down programme forShorts, the effects on its current orders and new orders already promised, andthe prospects for the reabsorption of Shorts&apos; labour force, skilled and unskilled,in other industries. The construction of new factories would not in itself add to new permanent employment; there can be no assurance that suitable industry would come forward in adequate volume and at the right time to absorb theShorts workers; and the Northern Ireland people would never accept that theunemployment situation in Northern Ireland will not be seriously worsened bythe abandonment of the manufacture of aircraft. If therefore the Chief Secretary&apos;proposal is to be pursued, I am sure that we should go no further at present than to seek the agreement of the Northern Ireland Government to the drawing up by officials of the two Governments, in confidence and without commitment, of theoutlines of a scheme on the basis of which a decision can later be taken.6. But even this limited proposal would be likely to produce a strong reaction from the Northern Ireland Government; and there would be a risk of leakage thatthe study was being undertaken. If, as I have suggested, we announce now theintention to bring Shorts in as sub-contractors on the OR-351, and they are therebyenabled to maintain a labour force not too far below the present level of 7,000for some years to come, there will be no advantage in embarking on the proposedstudy at the present time.H. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,25th February, 1963.
