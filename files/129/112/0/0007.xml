23rd January, 1963CABINETINDUSTRIAL DISPUTES:   ELECTRICITYINDUSTRYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department at their meeting on 17th January, the Cabinet invited me, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to circulate, in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, a memorandum discussing the courses ofaction open to the Government in the event of further interruptions in electricity supplies (C.C.(63) 4th Conclusions, Minute 1).    in discussion the point had been made that the proclamation of anemergency would make it possible to enforce a curtailment of demand;but public opinion would call for more positive steps.    It wassuggested that immediate consideration should therefore be given tosuch measures as the employment of troops to maintain output;  thepossibility of promoting, under the existing law, a charge of criminalconspiracy against individuals responsible for inciting disaffection inthe power stations;   and the advisability of seeking to strengthen theGovernments statutory powers in this respect.    I have now discussedthese matters with the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Power andthe Attorney-General.    In the time available it has not been possibleto reach specific conclusions, but it may be helpful to the Cabinet tohave this paper as a basis for further discussion.The present situation.     Normal working has been resumed in the electricity industry.If arrears of maintenance or severe weather conditions necessitatefurther load shedding, it will not be possible to restrain demand byproclaiming an emergency and making regulations and orders underthe Emergency Powers Act, 1920, because that Act can be used only when &quot;action has been taken or is immediately threatened by any persons or body of persons of such a nature and on so extensivea scale as to be calculated ... to deprive the community, or anysubstantial portion of the community, of the essentials of life&quot;.It is true that the unofficial work-to-rule might be resumed on a scalesufficient to justify action under these powers, but even then the effective action could only be negative - to forbid the use ofelectricity for certain purposes.3,      It would not be practicable to bring in troops so long as thereis no strike.    Even if some men were working-to-rule, the resultingloss of output could not be made good by bringing in troops to workalongside them;  and the use of troops in place of men refusing towork overtime might not add much to output and might indeed turn the overtime ban into a strike.[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C.(63) 7 COPY NO.   52
4.      Under the existing law, a charge of criminal conspiracy couldnot be brought against the individuals responsible for the recenttrouble in the industry.    This is ruled out by the terms of the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 187 5.    Under section 3of that Act an agreement or combination by two or more persons todo or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance ofa trade dispute is not indictable as a conspiracy if such act committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime, or unless it is aconspiracy for which a punishment is awarded by any Act of Parliament.Under section 4 of the Act it is an offence for a person engaged in thesupply of electricity wilfully and maliciously to break a contract knowingor having reasonable cause to believe that the probable consequenceswill be to deprive consumers wholly or to a great extent of their supply.    But, prima facie, working according to the rules is not aa wilful and malicious breach of contract.A future situation5.      Interruption of electricity supplies in future might (apart frominsufficiency of generating capacity or transmission or distributionfailures) result from a strike or work-to-rule or overtime ban -official or unofficial.    In a complete strike, it would be necessary toact at once under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, and use troops tomaintain as much production as possible.    The proportion of demand that could be met in this way would vary according to the time of year;  at present it might be of the order of 40 per cent.    In a partialstrike or in a situation of work-to-rule or an overtime ban it wouldseem right to proclaim an emergency if the loss of output was serious,so as to have power to restrict consumption;   and the use of troops -which might result in a full scale strike - would have to be considered in relation to the circumstances.Possible legislation.      The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies considered recentlyhow it might be made more difficult for strikes to be called in keyindustries.    After examining various possibilities the Committee onthat occasion concluded that it would not be wise to introduce legislation to restrict strike action.    It was thought better to concentrate on(a) positive steps to make the workers in the industry more responsible, and (b) discreet exposure of Communist activity.As to (a), the Minister of Power has now reported that in his view it would not be practicable to include a provision banning strikes inthe proposed scheme for raising the status of workers in the industry.As to (b), action is proceeding.7.      We have again considered the various possibilities examined by the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies and also the special problem of dealing with difficulties brought about by action - such aswork to rule or a ban on overtime - falling short of a withdrawal oflabour.    None of the suggestions for legislation which have been examined appears to us to provide a wholly satisfactory solution to theproblem.    Possibilities which we have reviewed are considered in the following paragraphs.
9 98.      The only present statutory limitation of the right to strike isthe provision in section 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection ofProperty Act, 1875, as extended by section 31 of the Electricity SupplyAct, 1919.    The effect of these provisions is that an employee ofah electricity, gas or water undertaking who goes on strike without giving the period of notice necessary to terminate his contract ofservice (which is in most cases one week) is guilty of an offence.If it were decided to strengthen the restraints on strike action in keyindustries, it might be possible to revive the power which the Ministerof Labour had during the war (by virtue of Defence Regulations) to forbid a strike unless within twenty-one days he had failed to refer a dispute for settlement by arbitration.    The legislation did notachieve much in the way of preventing strikes, which were hardly less frequent during the war than they have be en since.    It had some effecton the trade unions, but it did not prevent unofficial strikesj  and once a strike had broken out the fear of retribution did little to shorten the stoppage.    It was found to be quite impracticable to enforce a prohibition against large numbers of strikers.9.      There are obvious difficulties in the way of devising measuresto combat action, such as work to rule or refusing to work overtime,which is in itself lawful.    As indicated in paragraph 4 above, workersacting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute are atpresent protected against a charge of conspiracy by section 3 of the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.    It might bepossible to enact that, notwithstanding the terms of this section, anagreement or combination by two or more persons shall be indictableas a conspiracy if it deprives people wholly or to a great extent oftheir supply of electricity.    (The position of gas, water and transport would also have to be considered.)    But unless official action by tradeunions is to be proscribed, it would still be necessary to leave to official strikes - and possibly to other kinds of official action fallingshort of strikes - the protection afforded by the section.     legislation on these lines would mean a novel extension of the common lawconception of criminal conspiracy.    There would be difficulties of enforcement, e. g. , because of the need to demonstrate a causalconnection between the actions of the persons charged and the loss ofproduction.    Moreover, it would make the operation of the criminal law dependent upon decisions of bodies of private persons, the union executives, and the Attorney-General would see strong objection tosuch legislation on this score.10.    Another possibility which we have examined is to enact that incertain essential industries any contract of service shall be deemed toinclude a provision that, during any period where the supply to thepublic is in danger, there shall be a requirement on the employee to perform all such work as the employer considers to be necessary tomaintain or to restore essential services.    This might, for example,include a requirement to work overtime.    Any failure on the part ofthe employee to comply with such a direction would put him in breach of contract and make him liable to suspension or dismissal;  and if theprobable consequences of the failure would be to deprive persons ofthe supply of gas, water or electricity, the employee would also be guilty of a criminal offence under section 4 of the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act, 187 5.    It seems unlikely that a provisionSFCRFT
of this kind could be negotiated with the unions concerned;  it wouldhave to be imposed by law, and there would be difficulties both of definition and of enforcement.    It could hardly be left entirely to the employer to invoke the operation of this special term of the contractwhenever he thought fit;  it would be necessary, before it could be invoked, for the appropriate Minister to declare that a danger periodhad been entered.11.     We are far from certain whether any of these possible courses of action will be found, on further examination, to provide a practicable solution of the difficulties which have been encountered inthe electricity industry.    The view has been taken hitherto that the processes of the criminal law are not suitable for use in industrialmatters.    Nevertheless, we are agreed that the public expects somepositive action to protect it against a recurrence of the go-slowtactics which have inflicted not only inconvenience but hardshipduring the past few weeks.12.    It may be that, rather than pursue the idea of legislation, weshould seek to ensure that the system of working in essential industries, and the rules governing them, are such that a ban onovertime, or advice to work strictly in accordance with the rules, doesnot have the grave effects shown in the electricity industry recently.Fresh efforts might be made to try to persuade the unions that it is their responsibility, and in accordance with their interests, to takedisciplinary action to deal with those of their members who behavein the way that the unofficial shop stewards in the electricity industry have recently been doing.    If the men who are really responsible forunofficial troubles in essential industries can be identified, it mightbe left to their employers to take any opportunity that offers of gettingrid of them from the industry.    Finally,   we might seek to develop arelationship between management and workers which gives the latterthe fullest sense of responsibility for a service essential to the life of the community.H.
