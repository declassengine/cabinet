CABINETCENTRAL africa memorandum by the First Secretary of state in my statement to the House about Central Africa on 19th December, I saidthat now that new administrations were in Office in Northern and SouthernRhodesia, Her Majesty&apos;s Government intended to engage in early consultations with the Federal and Territorial Governments. I also said that I proposed to visit Central Africa to initiate these consultations, and &quot; to seek, in co-operationwith the Governments concerned, ways and means of achieving a practical anddurable solution &quot; (Hansard, Columns 1266 and 1267).2. I am proposing to fly to Central Africa on 18th January and shall bethere for about a fortnight. I shall visit all three territories and hold informaltalks with the Federal and Territorial Governments.3. The election results in Northern and Southern Rhodesia, together withour decision about the secession of Nyasaland, have created a new situation. InNorthern Rhodesia there is now an African Nationalist Government firmlycommitted to secession from the Federation and sensitive to any suggestion thatthey should in this respect be treated any differently from Nyasaland. Mr. WinstonField&apos;s Government in Southern Rhodesia is playing the Federal issue warily.The Rhodesia Front, however, is essentially &quot; White Southern Rhodesian &quot; inoutlook, and is uncommitted by any ties of traditional or party loyalty to themaintenance of a Federal system. As regards Nyasaland, personal contact hasbeen established between the leader of the Malawi Congress Party, Dr. Banda,and Mr. Field, but it remains to be seen how far, even with the promise of secession, Dr. Banda is prepared to go at this stage in discussing economic links with the other territories.4. Politically the position of the Federal Government has been seriouslyweakened and, although commanding a substantial majority in the federal assembly, the United Federal Party is now out of office in all three territories.At the same time, the decision in principle to allow Nyasaland to secede hashardened the determination of the Federal Government to maintain a strong and&quot; permanent &quot; political and economic association between Northern and SouthernRhodesia. Certain statements made by the Federal Prime Minister, Sir roy welensky, at the time the decision on Nyasaland was announced, suggest that,at that time at least, he was thinking in terms of using the Federal armed forces, ifnecessary, to secure this objective.5. I feel sure that in these circumstances the main emphasis during my visitmust be on talks with the Territorial Governments. I am anxious to evolve as effective an association as possible between Northern and Southern Rhodesia,preferably with some political &quot; teeth &quot;. But the only realistic approach is to explore how far it will, in fact, be possible to lead the two Governments alongthis line. The political relationship between Sir Roy Welensky and Mr. Fieldwill be an important factor here, and it is early yet to be sure how this will develop.I doubt, however, whether it will now be possible to take the present Federalstructure as a starting point for future negotiations. I think we shall probably have to start with considering the essential ties of economic self-interest, and workon from there.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

6. On my return I shall hope to give my colleagues a fuller picture of thesituation which confronts us, together with further ideas as to how this situation should be tackled. I want to take things as steadily as I can, but pressures will persist for decisions to be taken. Quite apart from political pressures and the(desirability of removing uncertainty, continuing doubt about the form in whichthe territories may in future be associated will make it even more difficult to handle the highly complicated process of detaching Nyasaland from the presentFederation, as well as the constitutional questions affecting the Rhodesias to whichthe secession of Nyasaland, in itself, gives rise.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W. 1,11th January, 1963.
