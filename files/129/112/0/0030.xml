THIs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. 52-?.6th February, 1963CABINETTHE FUTURE OF SHORTS, BELFASTMemorandum by the Minister of aviation have reluctantly been forced to the conclusion, as I statedlast October (C. (62) 144), that it will not be possible, in the long term,to maintain Shorts as a balanced unit, designing and producing aircraft and guided weapons on its own.    If, moreover, the contract for or. 351 is to go to the Hawker Siddeley Group rather than to Shorts&apos;,the Shorts design staff (of about 1, 000) now face an early and substantial reduction.     I see no prospect of giving Shorts further design work ofsignificance, either on the aircraft or the guided weapons side.2.      It does not, of course, follow that because the design team goes,Shorts should go out of the aircraft business altogether.    We haverecently agreed to provide Shorts with some  10 million to complete their Belfast and Seacat contracts.    We are also sub-contracting workon the VC.10&apos;s for the R.A.F.    I consider that if we do decide to givethe OR. 351 contract to Hawker Siddeley some of the production work should be sub-contracted to Shorts.     This could start in 1967.     Thereare likely to be repeat orders by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for Seacatgiving work until 1970,    Spares backing will also be required for the belfast so long as it remains in service.    Altogether, there is a firmprospect of enough work to enable a production labour force not too farbelow the present level of 6, 000 or so to be usefully employed until about 1970.3.      As majority shareholders in. Shorts we are in no doubt about the strong feeling that exists about the aircraft industry in Northern Ireland.It is not just a question of their bread and butter.     They are proud ofthe factory and its achievements.    It has been a base for technological education and the spreading of engineering skills to other Ulsterindustries.4.      The Shorts factory was, of course, built for the manufacture oflarge aircraft.    In recent years the firm have tried to diversify their activities but it is hard to escape the conclusion that unless a very greatdeal of money were spent in redeveloping the site, the overheads -e. g. lighting, heating, cleaning, maintenance - would prove excessivefor almost any other kind of production.5.      It is true that aircraft production costs are rather higher inNorthern Ireland than in Britain.    Sub-contracting to Shorts thusinvolves some extra cost to Her Majesty&quot;s Government.    Nevertheless,-1-C. (63) 3Q
I am inclined to question whether the Trading Estate proposal would be economically better for Northern Ireland or lessexpensive to the Government than continuing to place aix&apos;craftsub-contract work with Shorts.6.      In all this we shall no doubt have largely to be guided by the views of the Northern Ireland Government.    But if it wereto be decided to retain Shorts as a production unit in theaviation industry, I would propose to continue our efforts tobring about a long-term association between Shorts and one orother of the major airframe groups.J. A.Ministry of Aviation, W, C. 2,25th February, 1963
