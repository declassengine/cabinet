W. 1.5th March, 1963
TEXT OF TELEGRAM FROM THE SECRETARY OFS TATEFOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS AND SECRETARY OFOF STATE FOR&quot; THE COLONIES DATED KAMPALA,4th MARCH, 1963ENAHORO1.     Nigeria is the largest, most stable, most moderate and most friendly of all Commonwealth countries in Africa;  and Abubakar is by far the most Pro-British of all African statesmen.2.     If as a result of refusing to return Enahoro we were to loseAbubakar&apos;s sympathy and goodwill and that of Nigerian public opinion,we would at one stroke destroy much of the goodwill whichAnthony Head and others have painstakingly built up since independenceThis would represent a major diplomatic reverse for Britain and theWest.3.      I fully appreciate the Home Secretary&apos;s difficulty.    But whenso much is at stake I trust that every effort will be made to find anhonourable justification for sending Enahoro back to Nigeria.4. Without having all the facts before me I hesitate to offer adviceBut these are my thoughts:-(a) Although the Lord Chief Justice attached importance to thepoint made by Hutchinson that British counsel had the right to appearbefore Nigerian courts, it was made quite clear to Appeals Committeethat no guarantee could be given that Immigration Act would in no circumstances be invoked;  and no assurance to this effect fromNigeria was asked for before dismissal of appeal.    Since the chief justice was prepared to leave this to chance, is it really incumbenton the Home Secretary to probe further into the matter ?(b) It is quite normal for any Government to refuse to say inadvance what would be the attitude of its immigration authorities toan application not yet made in respect of a person not yet named.   Hasthe British Government ever been willing to answer hypotheticalquestions of this kind?(c) The Nigerian Government, while declining to give an advanceassurance that British counsel will be admitted, has not said thatadmission will be refused.    The matter is therefore in doubt.    Isthe Home Secretary not justified in giving the benefit of the doubt (asthe British court has done) to a friendly Government which has a record of fairness and moderation?-1-
(cl)    There is no evidence that Nigerian Government has eversought to intimidate Nigerian barristers conducting defence cases.Therefore, supposing after all the Nigerian immigration authoritiesshould refuse admission of a British barrister, does it follow that aNigerian barrister will not honestly do his best to secure acquittalin accordance with the highest traditions of the legal profession?(e)    It may be that Nigerian counsel would perhaps not be asclever as British counsel, though this is not certain.    But in anycase is there any reason why Enahoro should be entitled to bettercounsel than the other accused?5, In the light of the above considerations I submit that Enahoroshould be sent back to Nigeria for trial providecl:-(a) that the Nigerian Government has not statedpositively that admission of British counselwill be refused;  and(b) that there is no evidence that, in the event ofBritish counsel being refused entry, the nigerian Government is likely to restrict the freedom of Nigerian Defence counselthrough intimidation or otherwise.6.     I should be grateful if this telegram could, be circulated asa Cabinet paper.-2-
