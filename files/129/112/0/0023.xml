(this s DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (63) 2318th February, 1963COPY NO.52CABINETSATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for air in C. (63) 16 and 19 various suggestions are made for our participation in a world system of satellite communications and methods discussed for playing our hand vis-a-vis the United States,Europe and the Commonwealth.2.      I believe this hand would be immensely strengthened if we made a start now on the design of a communication satellite of ourown.    I would thus go a little further than recommended in para-graph 3(f) of C.(63) 16 and paragraph 1 of C. (63) 19.3.      The cost would not be very great (perhaps  25 million overseven years - including  14.5 million for test firings - of which about  250, 000 would be needed in the first year).    Much usefuland successful work has already been done by the Royal aircraft establishment.    Industrially, I do not believe we can afford toneglect the spectrum of technologies associated with satellites:militarily, such neglect would be perilous.    At the least, to go ahead on our own would insure against an unsatisfactory outcometo the negotiations with the Americans.4.      If we are to go ahead effectively, one department should bein charge of the project.    I would have thought this should be theMinistry of Aviation.&quot;&quot;7 &quot;j5.      To sum up, I recommend that -(i)  We should start now to design a communicationsatellite.(ii)  The Minister of Aviation should be invited to take action accordingly.H.F.Air Ministry, S. W. 1.18th February, 1963.
