Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1963C. (63) 48 Copy No.     5213 th March, 1963CABINETDOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am reporting the outcome of discussion in the Wages Committee of therecommendations which the Review Body on remuneration of National health service doctors and dentists made to the Prime Minister on the 27th February.2. The central recommendation is that present rates of remuneration shouldbe raised by 14 per cent.   Details are given in the Annex to this memorandum.3. The Review Body was appointed last year by the Prime Minister inaccordance with recommendations of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; Remuneration, which reported in 1960 that there should be such a body&quot; of eminent persons of experience in various fields of national life to keep medical and dental remuneration under review &quot;. This recommendation was one of anumber which the Government and the professions accepted as a package; and itweighed heavily with the professions in persuading them to accept the package.4. Among the other recommendations in the package were rates of pay forall National Health Service doctors and dentists which took effect from 1st January, 1960, and were expected by the Royal Commission to apply to 1961and 1962 as well as to 1960. The Royal Commission^ approach, which they also recommended for the Review Body on subsequent occasions, was to gauge a figure which they thought would be fair taking the period as a whole, though itwould be too high at the start of the period and too low at the end of it. the review Body have, with apparent misgivings, used the same approach. Had they accepted the Royal Commission^ rates as having fulfilled the intentions, their task would have been to measure the movement needed to adjust the rates for movementover the three years from the middle of the last triennium to the middle of thecoming one. But in fact they judged the Royal Commission^ rates to have beenovertaken much earlier in the last triennium than was expected. They have alsodated the coming triennium from 1st April next, rather than 1st January lastwhen the previous triennium ended. Taking account of these two points, they point out that their figure of 14 per cent concerns trends which will have occurredover a period &quot; much in excess of three years &quot;. Moreover, they say that they haveframed their recommendations with the intention that they should be likely toremain appropriate for a period, beginning on 1st April, 1963, of three years&quot; at least&quot;.5. The Wages Committee are unanimously agreed, after full discussion, thatthere would be more to be lost than to be gained by asking the Review body for more precise statements of the make-up of their figure of 14 per cent andof the period over which the movement reflected in that figure will have occurred.We have also considered and unanimously rejected the possibility of announcingthat the recommendations are accepted but with qualifications or reservations.6. We have concluded that the best course is to announce acceptance ofthe Review Body&apos;s recommendations, probably (subject to consultations whichthe Minister without Portfolio is holding) by means of a Written Question and answer which would contain the text of the Review Body&apos;s report; and toarrange for the appropriate Ministers to be available to talk to the lobbycorrespondents. In this way it could be explained that the Government interpret the Review Body&apos;s reference to the period of &quot;much in excess of three years&quot;which underlies their 14 per cent as indicating about four years, so that the14 per cent is equivalent to about 3i per cent a year; and also that, noting that2230
the Review Body consider that the new rates can be expected to remainappropriate at least until March 1966, the Government consider that the increase is such that they should stand for longer than this.7.   I have undertaken to discuss the timing of the announcement with theMinister of Health.f 3 8. We have also concluded that the best way to react to the Review Body&apos;sevident doubts about the system recommended by the Royal Commission wouldbe to make an informal offer at the appropriate moment to discuss this aspectwith them.  No public statement would be made on this.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,13th March, 1963.ANNEXDoctors and Hospital dentists. The basic recommendation is for a 14 per cent increase in existing salaries and salary scales, the new rates to operate from 1st April, 1963, and last for a periodof &quot; at least three years &quot; from then.2.   Examples of how the increase would broadly work out are:	Present	Proposed rAverage net income of general medical practitioners	z	zfrom official sources   ...	2,425	2,765Hospital Doctors and Dentists		(a) House Officers (first post).......	675	770(b) Consultant (maximum) without distinction		award    ...      ...           &apos;-.     ,    ... &apos;	3,900	4,445(c) Consultant (maximum) with highest dis-		tinction award  ...     ........	7,900	9,0003.  The Review Body emphasise the difference	between	the problempresented to them and the normal procedure for pay settlements.		They explain that:(i) The Pilkington Royal Commission recommended that the current rates,introduced, as recommended by them, from 1st January, 1960, should stand for at least three years, provided there was no change in thecurrent trends and economic circumstances, and that subsequentsettlements should aim at stability for a similar period.(ii) The Review Body had therefore had to look back to 1st January, 1960,as well as ahead to 1966.(iii): It is inherent in the system that at the beginning of a period the rates would be above, and at the end below, the &quot; right &quot; figure for the timebut would be adequate over the period taken as a whole.&apos; The review body: were satisfied that the rates introduced on 1st January, 1960, didnot in fact allow fully for the changes that have subsequently takenplace in economic and other circumstances and were overtaken &quot; much earlier &quot; than the Royal Commission had expected.(iv) In addition to making allowance for the divergence of trends from thoseassumed by the Royal Commission, they also took note of certainfactors which the Royal Commission said would always be relevant:the cost of living, the movement of earnings in other professions, andthe quality and quantity of recruitment of all professions. They alsotook into account the national interest and other factors including a wide range of data concerning incomes in other callings and employment.They do not disclose what weight they allowed for the different factors.
General Dental Practitioners4. For general dental practitioners the Body recommend that the DentalRates Study Group (the Committee set up, on the recommendation of the RoyalCommission, to fix dental fees so as to ensure that the net income received bygeneral dental practitioners matched the intended figure) should first satisfy itselfthat the current scale of fees produces neither substantially more nor substantially less than the current average target income of  2,400 from the General DentalService for all principals working in it, and then adjust the scale to produce a revised target rate of income of  2,740 a year (i.e., about 14 per cent higher) with effect from such time as the Study Group agrees upon the adjusted scale, not beingearlier than 1st April, 1963.Minor Recommendations5.   Minor recommendations include:(a) no increase in the number of distinction awards for consultants;(b) some increases, to be negotiated, in board and lodging charges for residenthospital doctors;(c) health centre dentists not to receive the recommended increase: their remuneration to remain broadly linked for the present with that oflocal authority dentists;(d) the 14 per cent increase to apply generally to other items of remuneration.6.   The estimated total additional cost a year for Great Britain of what is this does not include any extra cost for general dental practitioners; that would depend on the extent to which the current net income is in fact falling below the recommended new level. This may well be much less than 14 per cent.Costproposed is:Hospital Doctors and DentistsGeneral Medical PractitionersTotal16
