POSSIBLE IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN FUEL OILMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 25th January, 1963, the Economic Policy Committee (E.A. (63) 4th Meeting)considered papers by the President of the Board of Trade (E.A. (63) 10) and theMinister of Power (E.A. (63) 11) on the question whether an import quota of fuel oil from Russia should be authorised in order to obtain substantial orders for ships to be built in this country for the USSR.2. The paper by the President referred to recent Russian interest in placingconsiderable orders for ships but suggested that the Russians were likely to makethe placing of orders in this country conditional on their being given facilities tosell oil in the United Kingdom. The President therefore asked for authority tobe able to respond to a Russian initiative by negotiating for a quota of fuel oil,not exceeding 2 million tons a year for the remaining 18 months of the presentFive-year Trade Agreement in exchange for substantial orders for our shipbuilders.He thought that there would not be a case for conceding a fuel oil quota of morethan 1 million tons a year for shipbuilding orders worth, say,  30 million, and only if the Russians offered to spend a much larger figure such as  50 million didhe propose to agree a fuel oil quota as large as 2 million tons per year.3. The Minister of Power&apos;s paper referred to the very grave effect of importing cheap Russian oil upon our large investments in both coal and oil. Hethought that foreign investment in oil refineries in this country would be discouraged if we allowed imports of Russian fuel oil, while a reversal of thepresent ban on imports of oil from Russia would be distasteful to the United StatesGovernment.4. It was not possible to reach agreement in the Economic Policy Committee,partly because it was felt that the full economic consequences of allowing or refusingimports of Russian oil, and the political implications both at home and abroad,had not been worked out in sufficient detail for a considered decision to be taken.It was considered also that it would be necessary to seek a Cabinet decision onthese important issues upon which divided views were held in the Committee.5. The Committee accordingly invited the President of the Board of Trade,in consultation with other Ministers directly concerned, to arrange for an examination by officials of the economic and political consequences of allowingor refusing imports of Russian fuel oil in connexion with prospective Russian ordersfor ships. I undertook to arrange for the question to be considered by the cabinet at an early date as soon as this report had been submitted to me.6. Officials of the Departments concerned have now drawn up the attached report which considers the economic and political arguments, upon which departments hold divergent views, for and against a change in our existing policyof the almost complete exclusion of Russian oil, in the light of possible Russianinterest in placing orders for ships.7. I invite my colleagues to consider what our policy should be in the lightof these arguments.R.

SALES OF BRITISH SHIPS IN EXCHANGE for imports OF RUSSIAN OIL(Report by Officials)In the last few months the Russians have begun to dispLay an interest in buyingships from British yards for the first time since 1955-56. A delegation from theSoviet importing corporation has made enquiries for ships which would totalbetween  30 and  80 million. A list of their enquiries and the yards to whichthey have been directed is set out in the annex to this paper.2. Enquiries parallel to these have also been made in other West european countries and in Japan. It appears that in general all the potential suppliers willquote competitive prices and credit terms and will be able to achieve delivery at times which will meet the Soviet requirements. But there is no reason to thinkthat Soviet holdings of other foreign currencies are such that it would be easier for them to finance purchases on the Continent or in Japan than in the UnitedKingdom. Equally we know -that the Russians have no significant reserve of sterling. All the other countries concerned already import Russian oil; but it isnot known whether they would be prepared to increase their purchases further toobtain orders for ships. Thus, it does not appear that there are any special factors which would lead the Russians to prefer any of the other tenders to the British.It follows that there are no special financial reasons why competitive Britishtenderers should not get some share of the contracts. It is, of -course, true thatthe Russians would probably prefer ito sell oil rather than gold; and it may bethat if they were able to earn a significant quantity of extra sterling this wouldinduce them to place a substantial share of their shipbuilding orders in this country.The Russians have told many organisations in this country that they are interestedin buying ships against oil. They have also left the Minister of Transport in nodoubt that shipbuilding orders were dependent on buying Russian oil and thehead of the Soviet Trade Delegation has repeated this to Board of Trade officials.3. The President of the Board of Trade considers that there are solid prospects of achieving a ships-for-oil deal and has proposed that it would be reasonable ifthe Russians decided to place orders for  30 million worth of ships to establish a quota of 1 million tons of fuel oil, which would be worth about  4 million; only if they were prepared to place orders amounting to  50 million would it be justifiable to increase the quota to 2 million tons ( 8 million).4. The offer to the Russians would be to establish the quota for the remaining18 months of the present Five-year Trade Agreement, i.e., 1-V to 3 million tons, andthe Russians would be told that, as with other quotas, we could undertake no commitment going beyond that date. The most they could be told would be thatin deciding our future import programme from Russia we would naturally take into account the pattern of trade that had developed. If they did not think thisarrangement gave them sufficient sterling and asked for a   for   arrangement theywould be told that this suggestion would be unlikely to be considered favourablyby Ministers.5. We now proceed to assess the economic and social effects in the UnitedKingdom of establishing a quota of l\ to 3 million tons of Russian fuel oil for theremaining 18 months of the Five-year Trade Agreement.Effects on the Shipbuilding industry. British shipyards are facing a crisis. Shipping is depressed. Orders for ships are well below normal. At the same time, world shipbuilding capacity is nowmuch greater than will be needed, even when demand for ships recovers. To keep their competitive strength, British shipyards have invested large sums inmodernisation and re-equipment.   They now need work desperately.7. Until recently, redundant workers in shipyards could normally find employment elsewhere in the neighbourhood. This is no longer the case. Themain shipyards are in areas where it is now very difficult to find other work. InDecember, 1962, 19,000 men in the industry were unemployed (9^ per cent of itslabour force). If orders continue to come in at the rate of the last two years, about15,000 more will be made redundant in the yards before the end of 1963.
8. It is estimated that orders worth  30 million would create employmentover the next two years for 8,000 men in the shipyards and 12,000 men withsubcontractors. Orders of  50 million would produce 12,000 jobs in the shipyardsand 18,000 with subcontractors outside them. If orders were placed in March 1963work in the yards could begin by June. These Russian orders are, therefore,probably the quickest means open to us of helping the shipbuilding industry and giving work to unemployed men. It is possible that the prospect of new work would prevent some dismissals in the meantime.Effects on the Fuel Industries9. Consumption of fuel oil in the United Kingdom was million tons in1962; the expected average annual increase for the next few years is about 14- million tons. We imported over 7 million tons of fuel oil in 1962; after allowing for exports,net fuel oil imports were about 4 million tons. Our total imports of crude oil andrefined products in 1962 were 68 million tons. Thus, a quota of 1^-3 million tonsof fuel oil over 18 months would be about 5-10 per cent of inland consumption;would increase our net imports of fuel oil by between 25 and 50 per cent; andwould form 2-3 per cent of our total oil imports.10. There are conflicting views on the effect that Russian fuel oil imports would have on the prices of fuel oil and other fuels in the United Kingdom. SomeDepartments believe that the admission of Russian fuel oil would bring somemarginal pressure on fuel oil prices but would not cause a dramatic break. Theirreason is that a quota limited to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of total UnitedKingdom fuel oil consumption is too small to have a very significant effect on fuel oil prices in general, particularly as consumption is rising anyway by l\ million tonsa year. In addition, the established oil companies have said that they would be unwilling to handle Russian fuel oil. Since they control practically all the handlingfacilities, use of Russian oil is likely to be limited to consumers situated on or near the coast. In the very short term, therefore, even if the quota were large enoughto affect fuel oil prices generally, the effect of Russian oil imports is likely to be both localised and limited, though later the effect would spread. These Departmentsconclude that there is little prospect that it would increase the total demand for oilor accelerate the process of switching from coal to fuel oil in British industry.11. Other Departments believe that the effect would be severe. Since theRussians would be trying to sell, for the first time, a quantity of fuel oil which wouldbe near to or greater than the expected annual increase in fuel oil demand and doing so in competition with established suppliers they would be forced intoconsiderable price reductions in order to secure their business. At present a typicalex-tax price for fuel oil in the areas in which Russian oil would most likely be soldis, after allowing for rebates,  6 10s. a ton. Russian fuel oil is already being landed in this country (for the Associated Portland Cement Company) at  4 7s. a ton; this gives a difference in price of more than  2 a ton. This gives an indication of the sort of price reduction that could be involved. Given the present competitive stateof the United Kingdom fuel oil market, it would be impossible to isolate the priceeffects of Russian oil imports. The reduction in prices would work its way through to those not immediately affected by Russian oil, oil would beoome even more attractive as a fuel than coal, and the process of switching to oil would be accelerated.12. On the first expectation that Russian oil caused no significant alteration in the general price of fuel, the social effect of taking it would be the creation of jobs indicated in paragraph 8 above. All of these would be a net gain since thereis no prospect that any other foreign purchaser will be placing orders which would otherwise absorb the capacity and labour employed in the yards. This assumes thatno contracts would be placed in the United Kingdom if an import quota for oilwere not given. It is possible, however, that some at any rate of the orders would come to United Kingdom shipyards, regardless of the decision on oil, but it isdifficult to quantify the gain in terms of jobs. Any gain would be a net gain. Onthe other hand, there may be some loss of jobs in the future in so far as oil companies are deterred from providing refinery capacity in this country, and the tanker ordersthat go with them, as explained in paragraph 3 of the paper by the Minister of power (E.A. (63) 11).13. If, on the other hand, Russian oil imports were additional to the normalannual growth in the consumption of fuel oil, and thus led to a replacement of coaleither directly, or indirectly, through a general fall in oil prices, a severe strain would2061
be placed on the financial position of the coal industry and on its policy of closingpits. The coal industry still has a tremendous task before it in adapting itself tofalling demand. It has a heavy pit closure programme under way involving the closure by 1965 of over 200 pits producing 27 million tons of coal. This programmebears most severely on Scotland and the North-East Coast, where manpowerreductions of 24,000 and 28,000 respectively are expected. In view of the desperatesituation, even in present circumstances, in the coal industry in the North-East,Ministers have agreed to special arrangements to assist mining employment thereby preserving outlets for its production against oil (E.A. (63) 15). The national coal Board also has to meet an agreed financial target of breaking even during thenext five years, including proper provision for depreciation in accordance with theWhite Paper. It has been estimated that the effect of importing 2 million tons ofRussian fuel oil would be not less than the loss to the Board of  5 million a yearand the further loss of some 9,000 to 10,000 jobs.Effects on the Balance of Payments14. A Committee of Officials last year analysed the effects on the balanceof payments of importing 2 million tons of Russian fuel oil. Their conclusionsreflected the difference between Departments referred to above, on the effects of importing Russian fuel oil on the level of fuel oil prices, but they were unanimousthat the net effect on the balance of payments would not be very large. On theassumption that there was no general change in fuel prices there would be a gainof  7 million, and on the assumption of a general price fall of 20 per cent therewould be a loss of  4 million. These assumptions were, however, made on thebasis that the cost of oil imports would be matched   for   by British exports.If the Russians were prepared to accept a quota of less value than the ships theypurchase the gain would be pro tanto increased. The calculation would need further modification if, as is claimed to be likely, imports of Russian oildiscouraged foreign oil companies from installing refineries in this country withtheir consequential investment in tankers and other equipment. The balance ofpayments would be adversely affected by greater imports of the dearer refined products (as opposed to crude oil) by these companies for some years ahead, andby the loss of substantial inward investment (1 million tons of refinery capacitycosts about  10 million to install). There might however be offsetting factors,e.g., lower remittance of profits.15. The calculation does not take account of two other effects which it isimpossible to quantify:(a) any fall in internal oil prices, by reducing industrial costs, would helpBritish industry to compete in export markets; and(b) a decision to import Russian oil into the United Kingdom might cause other     ?;countries to take more with a consequential loss of overseas business and profits to British oil companies.Domestic Political Aspects16. There are likely to be political repercussions whether Russian oil is takenor not. The Russians have been at pains to see that the shipyards, the trade unions,the Press, and Members of Parliament, are aware of their offer in general terms toplace shipbuilding orders in return for a quota of oil. If we refuse to buy the oilMinisters may have great difficulty in defending a decision which deprives the shipyards and the steel industry of orders and which denies work to unemployedmen. The Scottish T.U.C. (Mr. George Middleton) and the Boilermakers Union(Mr. Ted Hill) are on record in favour of a &quot; ships for oil &quot; deal. On the other hand,the Mineworkers Union and their many representatives in Parliament, who arealready faced with a rigor6us programme of pit closures during the next few years,will resist strongly the establishment of a quota for Russian oil.Foreign Policy Considerations17. A decision to import Russian oil would be an important step forward in our policy of developing normal trade relations with the Russians. On the otherhand, it would be bound to do harm to our relations with the United States andwith the oil producing countries.
18. The effect on the oil producing countries from the point of view of thetonnage of their oil sold in the United Kingdom and the revenues they derive from those sales would not be great. The main effect would be psychological.The decision would have to be presented particularly carefully if it were taken nowbecause of the delicate negotiations which are in progress on the proposals putforward by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries; not because ourimporting Russian oil would have any direct bearing on the negotiations, but because our friendly relations with the countries concerned may prove of great value in avoiding any breakdown. This is particularly true of Iran where particular care would therefore be needed. The timing would be unfortunate with regardto Venezuela since the Venezuelans have been upset by the new American oilimport regulations and are also facing an election.19. We should also annoy the United States Government (as well as theUnited States oil companies) with whom it is essential to develop and expand our existing close co-operation on world oil problems, and on whom we could becomeheavily dependent, as in the past, for oil supplies if, for any reason, normal sources in the Middle East failed. Moreover following the breakdown in Brussels weshall have to discuss all our economic policies, including East-West trade problems,at high level with the United States Government. We would also be criticised in NATO where we took a leading part in formulating the policy of &quot; caution andrestraint&quot; in taking Russian oil, although the policy formula does not prohibitus from taking some Russian oil which most members already do.
