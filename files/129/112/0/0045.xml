ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees, 1963i. The 1963 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects ofthe agricultural industry has been held in accordance with the Agriculture Act,1947.I. Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production2. A further substantial increase in agricultural net output is forecast for1962/63 following a slight decline in 1961/62 from the level in 1960/61. On thenew index introduced at the 1960 Annual Review (average of 1954/55 to 1956/57= 100) net output for 1962/63 is forecast at 122 compared with revised figures of117 for 1961/62 and 119 for 1960/61.3. The cold spring of 1962 delayed germination but crop yields generally werehigh. In spite of difficult conditions at harvest time, production of wheat and barley was at a record level (see Table A, Appendix I). The numbers of cattle and sheep marketed are expected to be broadly the same as in the previous yearbut there is a notable increase in the number of pigs to be marketed 12-J million in 1962/63 compared with 11  million in 1961/62.4. After the 1962 harvest, tillage operations made excellent progress, but therecent prolonged period of exceptionally severe weather has caused many diffi-culties for farmers. In particular, there have been losses of ewes in some parts ofthe country and lambing prospects have suffered.Changes in Income5. When adjusted for normal weather conditions, the forecast for theindustry&apos;s net income in 1962/63 is  407 million compared with the revised estimate for 1961/62 on the same basis of  413 million. Actual net income is forecast at  408 million compared with the revised estimate for 1961/62 of 423-J- million. (Details of sales and expenses are given in Table C of Appendix II).Costs and Efficiency6. The prices of goods and services used in agriculture have in generalcontinued to rise. The main items are again the increase in the cost of labourand in rents, but this year there have been substantial reductions in the cost of fertilisers and interest charges. The net increase to be taken into account in this review is about  12^ million for Review commodities. On the other handaccount must be taken of the continuing improvement in the efficiency in theindustry. The figure of  25 million as in previous years is taken as an indication of the probable, rise on this account in farm income.Cost of Agricultural Support7. The Exchequer cost in 1961/62 reached  342-6 million. Expenditure in1962/63 is expected to be down to  321 million, but the Estimates presented toParliament for the coming year (which do not take into account the detefmina-tions made at this Review) show a further increase to the new high figure of 364 million.
II. Determination of GuaranteesLong-term Assurances8. In accordance with the Agriculture Act, 1957, the present determinationsmust be such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees* at not less than97-J- per cent, of their total value in 1962/63, after allowing for cost changes that have occurred on Review commodities since the 1962 Annual Review.The value of the guarantees in 1962/63 is about  1,410 million. Ninety-sevenand a half per cent, of this is  1,375 million. After taking account of the cost increase of  12  million, the maximum reduction in the total value of the guarantees would therefore be about  22J million.Milk9. The growing excess of production of milk over the standard quantity hasover the years brought about a continuing reduction in the pool price paid to producers. This year, with total sales approaching 2,500 million gallons, the pool price to the producer at 2s. 9d. a gallon is about 4d. below the guaranteed price! fQr the standard quantity. The standard quantity is increased each yearby the amount of the increase in liquid consumption and for 1963/64 will be2,056  million gallons. To the extent that the increase in production in any oneyear exceeds the increase in consumption of liquid milk the pool price is furthereroded. In 1960/61, compared with the previous year, the increase in the pro-duction of milk exceeded the increase in liquid consumption by some 140 million gallons. In 1961/62 the corresponding figure was some 60 million gallons.10. This year, however, the figure by which the increase in production exceeds the increase in consumption of liquid milk is only some 20 million gallons. even allowing for the effects of the hard weather it is evident that the rise in pro-duction is coming more into line with the rise in liquid consumption. Further-more there are signs that this trend will continue since the returns show a levellingoff in the size of the dairy herd and a significant reduction in the number of dairyheifers in calf.11. In these circumstances and having regard to the importance of milk to farm incomes, the Government have decided in this Review to raise the guaranteed price by -Jd. a gallon. They believe this to be justified whilst not cal-culated to stimulate a further increase in production, which would not be in theinterests either of farmers or of the nation.Fat Cattle12. Market prices for beef over the year 1962/63 have been higher than in1961/62 although total supplies of beef and veal have shown some increase.Home production is running at broadly the same level as last year. There hasbeen a rise in the number of calves for beef but it seems unlikely, particularlyin view of the trend towards marketing cattle at lower weights, that there willbe any significant increase in home production in the near future. The Govern-ment have decided to make no change in the guaranteed price.* The total value of the guarantees is the sum of (i) the value of the price guarantees(calculated for each commodity by multiplying the guaranteed price by the quantity of outputqualifying for the guarantee) and (ii) the value of the relevant production grants. In 1961/62,the total value of the guarantees was about  1,352 million.t The pool price is made up of the guaranteed price on the standard quantity and the much lower price on milk going to manufacture. The guaranteed price is 3s. 1 -85d. a gallonbut the Boards deduct from this approximately Id. a gallon which is the cost of transportfrom the farm to the first buyer.
Fat Sheep and Wool13. Though home production of sheep and lambs in 1962/63 is expected tobe marginally above the level of the previous year, market prices have been better on the average. The breeding flock last December was some 2 per cent,higher than in December, 1961. But losses of ewes in this severe winter andthe likely lower lambing rate will probably result in the 1963 crop of lambsbeing no larger than in 1962. The guaranteeed prices for sheep and wool will beleft unchanged.Fat Pigs14. The pig breeding herd has been on the increase and is now at a very high level. With the aim of stabilising the size of the pig herd, a flexible guaranteewas introduced at the 1961 Review with the basic guaranteed price related to a level of marketings of 10.3 to 10.8 million pigs a year. The present size of the pig herd leads to a forecast of marketings of about 12  million pigs a year.Imports have not altered significantly. Market prices have been falling and production is at present greater than the market can absorb at reasonable prices.The Government have decided at this Review not to alter the basic guaranteed price but to amend the arrangements for adjusting the guaranteed price accord-ing to changes in forecasts of marketings (see paragraph 19 below).Changes in the Structure of the Fatstock Guarantees and in the Feed Formulae15. Certain minor amendments in the qualifying standards for cattle are described in Part II of Appendix VI. A number of improvements in the presentguarantee arrangements, which are being made in this Review or are proposed for the future, are set out in paragraphs 16-20. Those proposed for the future will be discussed with the Farmers&apos; Unions in the coming months.16. The weekly calculation and the seasonal scales. The present arrahge-ments for cattle and sheep provide that the guaranteed price shall be variedupwards or downwards so as to produce a standard price for each week.These weekly standard prices are published as a seasonal scale at the start ofthe year so that the deficiency payment can be calculated and paid week byweek as the difference between market prices and the standard prices in that week. The seasonal scales of standard prices for both cattle and sheep arenow at certain periods of the year somewhat out of line with the present pattern of market prices. This tends to put too much emphasis on the subsidy andtoo little on the price received in the market. The seasonal scales will be adjusted to bring them more into line with the market pattern. Details ofthe changes to be made this year are in Part II of Appendix VI. For the future,the Government will be considering further modifications of the weekly standard price system.17. Quality payments. Cattle are at present graded officially as Grade Ior Grade II animals, and the subsidy payment is increased or decreased by a margin for the two grades. Quality payments are also made on &quot; baconpigs &quot;. It is as necessary as ever that livestock producers should be encouraged to seek further improvements in quality but, in the Governments view, themarket and not the Government should decide on quality. The producershould receive his reward for producing that quality not in the form of anadditional subsidy but in the extra price which the market will pay for what itwants.   Quality payments for both cattle and &quot; bacon pigs &quot; will therefore
be discontinued in the course of the next two or three years although nochange is being made in 1963/64.18. Pigs separate stabilising arrangements. There are at present arrange-ments known as the &quot; separate stabilisers &quot; designed to keep the returns to producers of &quot; bacon pigs &quot; and &quot; other pigs &quot; respectively within certainlimits of the guaranteed price. Under these arrangements the return in each week is calculated separately for the two categories. If returns for eitherdiverge by more than a certain amount from the guaranteed price, then the deficiency payment is adjusted to bring them to the prescribed limits. Thissystem has proved unsatisfactory in many respects. The Government thereforeintend to phase out this arrangement, by widening the stabilising limits thisyear preparatory to abolishing the separate stabilisers at the next Review.Details are in Part II of Appendix VI. The Government will be prepared toconsider before the next Review whether, when the separate stabilisers arefinally abolished, some alternative measure, not open to the same objections,is necessary in the interests of bacon pig producers.19. Pigs the flexible guarantee. When, at the 1961 Review, the basicguaranteed price was related to a level of marketings of 10.3 to 10.8 millionpigs, that price was made subject to reductions if numbers exceeded this quantity and to increases if they fell below. These arrangements did not howeverprovide for the progressive reductions in subsidy to continue after the forecastlevel of marketings exceeded 11  million pigs when a total abatement ofIs. 6d. a score came into effect. The arrangements will now be strengthened by extending the scale and the number of price adjustments. At the sametime, in recognition of the underlying upward trend in consumption of pig-meat,the level of marketings to which the basic guaranteed price relates is being raised to 10.5 to 11.0 million pigs. Further details are set out in Part II of appendix VI. On the latest forecast of numbers the deduction from the basicguaranteed price will be 3s. 6d. instead of the present Is. 6d. a score.20. Feed formulae. The feed formulae provide automatic adjustments inthe guaranteed prices for pigs and eggs in accordance with changes in feed costs.But conditions have changed considerably since these arrangements were introduced some 10 years ago. The Government intend to consider in thecoming year whether the arrangements should be abolished and if not what modifications are necessary.Eggs21. Egg production has continued to rise and would have been higher stillbut for a recent check due mainly to heavy slaughterings as a result of fowlpest. For most of 1962 the market was over-supplied from home productionand, despite the removal by the British Egg Marketing Board of large quantitiesof eggs for breaking-out, prices were extremely low. Imports of shell eggsfor the year were just over 2 per cent, of total consumption.22. New guarantee arrangements for hen eggs incorporating featuresanalogous to a standard quantity system are to be introduced this year. these arrangements will provide for an &quot; indicator &quot; price representing the price that the Board might be expected to receive from a market that was not over-supplied. This indicator price will be 3s. 2d. per dozen; it can be reconsideredin future years, but frequent changes should not be necessary.
23. The basic deficiency payment to the Board will be the difference betweenthe guaranteed price and the indicator price or the Board&apos;s average selling price, whichever is the higher. In addition, if the average selling price exceeds the indicator price, the excess will be shared as to one-third to the Board andtwo-thirds to the Exchequer.24. If the average selling price is below the indicator price, the Board, inthe early years of the scheme, will also receive part of the difference. In1963/64 the proportion so paid to the Board will be 60 per cent., but it is theintention to make progressive reductions in this proportion in subsequent years to 50 per cent., 40 per cent, and so on, towards elimination in 1969.The working of the scheme will be reviewed during the third year of its operation.25. A further feature of the scheme is that provision will be made, subjectto certain conditions, for an increase in Exchequer payments when importsrise above a level taken as normal in recent years. Details are in Part II of appendix VI.26. There will be no changes in the guaranteed prices for eggs.Cereals21. The total cereals acreage has in recent years been rising, and in 1962reached nearly 8 million acres compared with less than 1\ million acres in1957. The acreage figures for the individual cereals in 1962 confirm the trend of a sharply rising barley acreage; a declining oats and mixed corn acreage;and a wheat acreage fluctuating around 2 million acres. At the same timeyields, particularly of wheat and barley, continue to rise. In consequence,during the last five years production of wheat has risen from 2&apos; 7 million tons to 3-6 million tons, while barley has increased from 3-0 million tons to 5-8million tons.28. During this period total cereal imports (including maize and sorghum)have not shown any overall increase. The trend of market prices for home-grown wheat and barley has been generally downward. Prices for the 1962crop have been particularly low, and the estimated cost of Exchequer support in the financial year 1963/64 is  83 million compared with  64 million in 1962/63.29. The Government have therefore decided to reduce the guaranteed price of wheat by 5d. per cwt. and of barley by 1 Id. per cwt. The guaranteed prices for other cereals remain unchanged.Potatoes s30. The 1962 crop acreage was 30,000 greater than the previous year&apos;sbut even so was still on the low side. A further increase is considered desirable and the Government have decided to raise the guaranteed price by10s. a ton. The Market Support Fund referred to in the 1961 Annual review white Paper (Cmnd. 1311), designed to finance support buying in the eventof a surplus, has now been established for Great Britain, together with separatearrangements for Northern Ireland.Sugar Beet31. The present level of the guaranteed price for sugar beet continues toencourage growers to apply for more than the authorised contract acreagewhich must be limited because of our commitments under the commonwealth sugar Agreement. No increase in acreage can be made and it is not con-sidered necessary to increase the guaranteed price.   As announced in the
1962 White Paper (Cmnd. 1658) the arrangements for the 1963 crop willprovide a larger incentive for the production of beet of higher sugar content.Production Grants32. Fertiliser Subsidy. The quantity of fertilisers used continues to rise reductions in prices have more than offset reductions in the rate of subsidy in recent years and the total cost of the subsidy to the Exchequer has risen from  33 million in 1961/62 to  35 million in 1962/63; at current rates it isexpected to rise still further in 1963/64 to the figure of about  37 millionincluded in the Estimates. The Government have decided to reduce the rateof subsidy from 1st June next thereby reducing the total annual subsidy by 2 million.33. Ploughing Grants, Winter Keep and Grassland Renovation. As fore-shadowed in the 1962 White Paper, powers are now being taken under the agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill for the introduction of schemesfor grants to encourage the production of winter keep in livestock rearing areas and the renovation of permanent grassland. It is intended that the GrasslandRenovation Scheme shall come into operation in the autumn of 1963 and theWinter Keep Scheme in time to apply to crops grown for livestock feedingduring the winter of 1964/65. A reduction from  7 to  5 an acre in the ratefor the main ploughing grant will offset the cost of the new schemes.Schemes to Improve Agricultural Productivity34. The Farmers&apos; Unions have suggested that the Government might provideinitial assistance for a number of schemes designed to further agriculturalproductivity. The Government welcome action in this field but will need toconsider several of the schemes in more detail. It is however already clearthat national recording schemes for beef cattle and sheep could contribute substantially to raising the efficiency of production. If suitable schemes canbe devised the Government intend to make some contribution to the costs ofestablishing the necessary organisations until they can be taken over by theindustry. Discussions on this are being held with the Farmers&apos; Unions, theNational Cattle Breeders&apos; Association and the National Sheep Breeders&apos;Association.III.  Effect of Determinations35. The determinations made in the light of this Review will leave thetotal value of the guarantees virtually unchanged.36. Improvements have been made at this Review in the guarantee arrange-ments for eggs and for fatstock. This is a prelude to further changes whichwill be necessary in the development of the Governments agricultural policy.The cost of agricultural support to the Exchequer has risen steeply in recentyears from  263 million in 1960/61 to an estimated  364 million in the coming year. Changes are needed to bring this cost under more effective controlwhilst still ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and maintaining a proper balance between home-grown and imported food.Accordingly during the months ahead, the Government will be discussingtheir proposals with the leaders of the industry and with Commonwealth andother countries who supply foodstuffs to this market.

Note (ii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,700 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary, but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses.  Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.Note (iii). The figures for aggregate net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in the farmhousehold. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit andare relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (iv). From the figures for aggregate net income in Table A certain sumsshould have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over the original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops,etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Because themarketings of fatstock and wheat cannot be accurately forecast, producers&apos; averagereturns under the guarantees for those products in any year may be a little more orless than the guaranteed prices.(b) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee arrangementdescribed in Part II of this Appendix.(c) The prices guaranteed to the British Egg Marketing Board for hen eggs are onthe basis of the new guarantee arrangements described in paragraphs 22 to 25 above,and in Part II of this Appendix. The basis of the guarantee arrangements for duckeggs will remain unchanged.(d) The guaranteed price for barley is subject to arrangements whereby, toencourage a more even spread of marketings over the season, the deficiency payments are subject to premiums for barley delivered, after sale, in the later months of the cereal year and deductions for barley delivered in the early months of the year.
PART II.; Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shown in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and livestock products in 1963/64 and for crops of the 1963 harvest will be on a similar basis to those for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Fat Cattle2. Revised standard for young light weight animals. With effect from 1st April;1963 the following revised standard will apply:(a) If presented at a deadweight certification centre, the animal must not have cut any permanent incisor teeth and the dressed carcase weight must notbe less than 430 lb. in the case of a steer and 365 lb. in the case of a heifer.The carcase must be moderately compact and moderately thickly fleshedthroughout, with rounds moderately well developed and rounded, loinsand ribs thick and well-fleshed. The neck and shanks must be relatively short. Fat covering, which should be smooth and evenly distributed overthe exterior of the carcase, may vary in quantity from medium to light.Cod or udder, kidney and aitch fat should be adequate but not excessive.If the loins or ribs are only moderately thick and moderately well-fleshed,the carcase will not be excluded provided it satisfies these specificationsin all other respects.(b) If presented at a liveweight certification centre, the animal must not have cut any permanent incisor teeth and must weigh not less than 7 cwt. inthe case of a steer and not less than 6 cwt. in the case of a heifer. Itmust have an estimated killing-out percentage of not less than 55 per cent,and must, in the opinion of the fatstock officer, be such as to produce acarcase of at least the standard specified above.(c) An animal conforming to the standard set out in (a) or (b) above wouldqualify for Grade I.3. Maximum weights. As in previous years there will be no upper limit to the weight at which live steers&apos; or their carcases may be certified but any guaranteepayment will be restricted to the following weights: 4. Adjustment of seasonal scale. The seasonal scale of weekly standard prices will be adjusted so as to reduce the peak level of prices in the early weeks of thefatstock year by a maximum of 2s. Od. per live cwt. Compensating increases will bemade in the last weeks of the year so as to maintain a guaranteed price of 167s. Od.per live cwt.5. The differential of 5s. Od. per live cwt. between the rates of guarantee payment for Grade I and Grade II cattle will be applied by increasing the average rate of guarantee payment for home bred cattle by 2s. 3d. for Grade I and reducing it by2s. 9d. for Grade II. The resultant rates of payment will be rounded to the nearest6d. If, in respect of any week, the average rate of guarantee payment is 2s. 9d.per cwt. or less, there will be no guarantee payment on Grade II animals and appro-priate rates, to be announced separately, will be paid only on Grade I.6. Adjustment of seasonal scale. The weekly standard prices will be reduced by0-25d. per lb. over the period of peak marketings during August to November andcompensating increases will be made during other parts of the year so as to maintain a guaranteed price of 38d. per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight.7. Stabilising Limits. With effect from 1st April, 1963 the stabilising limits willbe widened by Is. Od. per score to 3s. 6d. above and 3s. Od. below the guaranteed price (as adjusted in accordance with the flexible guarantee arrangement and thefeedingstuffs formula).LiveweightDressed carcase weight ..1st April, 1963to 30th June, 196314 cwt.890 lb.On or after1st July, 196313 cwt.830 lb.Fat SheepFat Pigs
8. Quality Premiums. With effect from 1st April, 1963 the weight range of  score to 8 score 5 lb. for carcases of pigs eligible for the quality premiums will be altered to a range of 7 score to 8 score.9. Flexible Guarantee Scale. The flexible guarantee scale (set out in paragraph 24of the White Paper &quot; Annual Review and Determination of Guarantees, 1961 &quot;(Cmnd. 1311)) will be modified and with effect from 1st April, 1963 the new scalewill be as follows: Forecast level of certifications9-25 million or more but less than 9-50 million9-509-7510 0010-2510-5011 0011-2511-5011-7512-009-7510-0010-2510-5011-0011-2511-5011-7512-0012-25Adjustment to the basic guaranteed price4 2s.   9d.4- 2s.4 Is.4- Is.4Od.6d.Od.6d.Basic guaranteed price6d.Is.Is.2s.2s.Od.6d.Od.9d.There will be a further adjustment of 9d. for each complete 0-25 million or part thereof by which the forecast level of certifications falls below 9-25 million orexceeds 12-25 million.Milk10. The standard quantities for each area in 1963/64 will be as follows: Million gallonsChange New Standard QuantityEngland and WalesMain Scottish AreaAberdeen and DistrictNorth of ScotlandNorthern Irelandplus 21-4plus 0-7Nilplus 0-1plus 0-61,742-5186-519-89-598-2Hen Eggs11. Introduction of an Indicator Price System. New guarantee arrangements willbe introduced for hen eggs with effect from 31st March, 1963. The new system willbe based on an indicator price of 3s. 2d. per dozen and, subject to the adjustments in paragraphs 12, 13, and 14, deficiency payments will be the difference between the guaranteed price and the indicator price or the British Egg Marketing Board&apos;s averageselling price, whichever is the higher.12. If, during 1963/64, the average selling price is below the indicator price,60 per cent, of this difference will be met by the Exchequer and 40 per cent, by theBoard. The proportion of the difference to be met by the Exchequer will be reducedby a further 10 per cent, per year i.e., to 50 per cent, in 1964/65, to 40 per cent, in1965/66 and so on until it ceases in 1969.13. If the average selling price exceeds the indicator price, the excess will be shared as to one-third to the Board, which will no longer be required to maintain aReserve Fund, and two-thirds to the Exchequer.14. Subject to the following conditions, provision will be made for an increasein Exchequer payments when imports rise above a normal level. A normal level for this purpose will be determined for each month based on a total of 950,000 boxes(of 360 eggs) for the year but reflecting seasonal import variations. A price will bedetermined for each month based on the indicator price but reflecting seasonal pricevariations; and provisional payment will be made to the Board in respect of excessimports when the monthly price so determined is above the Board&apos;s average selling price for the month concerned. Such payments will be equivalent to 36s. Od. perbox of excess imports. Advance payments made on this basis will be confirmed ifthe Board&apos;s annual average selling price is below the indicator price; provided that
the total amount so paid will be reduced if it would otherwise raise the Board&apos;s totalreturn above the level of the guaranteed price. The method of making any such payments will be through an adjustment of the indicator price.Potatoes15. The Market Support Fund referred to in paragraph 27 of the White Paper&quot; Annual Review and Determination of Guarantees, 1961 &quot; (Cmnd. 1311), has beenestablished for Great Britain. Separate arrangements have been made for NorthernIreland.Sugar Beet -16. 1963 Crop.(a) Sugar Content. The guaranteed price for the 1963 crop will be related tobeet of 16-0 per cent, sugar content instead of 16-5 per cent.(b) Price Differential. The price differential will be increased to 10s. Od., plusor minus, for each one per cent, by which the sugar content varies from16-0 per cent.(c) Cupar Contract. The price and the terms on which the British sugar corporation will purchase sugar beet for processing at its Scottish factorywill be the same as for the English factories, except as follows: (i) on beet delivered by rail, the Corporation will pay rail freight inexcess of 6s. 3d. per ton; and(ii) on beet delivered by road, the Corporation will pay an amount equal to the rail freight in excess of 12s. 6d. per ton from thegrower&apos;s nearest station.17. 1964 Crop. The arrangements for early and late deliveries and the effect ofthe increased sugar content differential on the bonuses for these deliveries will beconsidered in relation to the 1964 crop.(30336)   Wt. 1178-289   K114   3/63   St.S.
