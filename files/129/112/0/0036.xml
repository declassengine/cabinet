DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)APPLICATION BY NIGERIA FOR THE RETURN of chief ENAHORO AS&quot;a FUGITIVE OFFENDERMemorandum by the Secretary of State  or theHome department i now have to decide whether to return Chief Anthony Enahoroto Nigeria for trial on charges of treasonable felony and relatedoffences, as I have power to do under section 6 of the Fugitive OffendersAct 1881 if I &quot;think it just&quot;.2.      On general principles it would be right for me to orderEnahoro&apos;s return unless there were strong and exceptional reasons to the contrary.    So far as is known, the only previous case in which any Home Secretary has declined to order the surrender of a fugutivecommitted by the courts under this Act is that of the two Cypriots,Zacharia and Arestidou, in 1962, when there were special considerations.Unlike the Extradition Acts, the Fugitive Offenders Act does not exclude political offences.    It may be that this Act ought now to be reviewed, with special reference to its application to independent commonwealth countries;   but under the law as it stands I am sureI ought not to invoke the political nature of the charge as a ground fordeclining to return Enahoro.    Indeed I should have, I consider, no good reason for not ordering his return, were it not for one disturbingpoint.3.     Mr. Noel Gratiaen, Q. C. , a member of the Nigerian bar, wasin November last refused admission to Nigeria to defend Awolowo inthe treason trial now proceeding in Nigeria.    A little earlierMr. Dingle Foot, Q. C. , M.P. , had been expelled from Nigeria whenhe had gone to appear on behalf of a close political ally of Enahoro&apos;sin an action being brought against the Federal Government.    Both the divisional Court and the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords,when Enahoro sought their protection in the present case, attached great importance to the question of Enahoro&apos;s right to the counselof his choice.    The Lord Chief Justice went so far as to say:&quot;if I felt there was some danger of that ^Te. of Enahoro&apos;s beingrefused counsel of his own choice^, I should myself hesitate beforerefusing some form of relief to the applicant&quot;.    Although anundertaking on this point given on behalf of the Nigerian Governmentwap eventually accepted as adequate by the Divisional Court and the appellate Committee, it did not amount to an unqualified assurance.I therefore sought, through the Commonwealth Relations Office, toobtain some clarification.    From confidential discussion which lord Head, our High Commissioner in Lagos, has now had withthe Prime Minister of Nigeria it is evident that the Nigerian Governmentare determined that Enahoro, if returned, should not be allowed tohave a British counsel to defend him.C.(63) 365th March, 1963CABINET-1-
4.     In these circumstances I do not think it just to return thefugitive.    In accordance with practice I would not propose to givereasons in announcing my decision;  but if pressed I should feel bound to say that it was because the courts here had committedEnahoro on the basis of an undertaking from the Nigerian Governmentwhich they understood to mean that he would be allowed counsel ofhis choice, and that, on special enquiries being made, the nigerian government had felt unable to confirm that this would be allowed.5.     I recognise that a decision not to return Enahoro may be interpreted as a reflection upon the Nigerian Government, and thatit may have an adverse effect on Anglo-Nigerian relations.    It isfor this reason that I am bringing the case to the notice of mycolleagues, but I am clear in my own mind that it would not bedefensible to return this man in the circumstances I have described.There is Parliamentary interest and I am receiving to-day(Tuesday) an all-party deputation, who are likely to represent tome strongly that I should not order Enahoro&apos;s return.    A decisionought not to be delayed, since under section 7 of the Act it is nowopen to the fugitive to apply afresh to the Divisional Court for release.    Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views, I should like, if possible,to announce my decision this week.H.B.Home Office, S. W. 1.5th March, 1963-2-
