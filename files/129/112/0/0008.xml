HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)&quot; 52&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;C.(63) 8 COPY NO.-./..... _23rd january  1963CABINETBRITISH POLICY IN RELATION TO..THE ESTABLISHMENT OFTHE FETJERATjONOF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDMemorandum .bx the^Lor^^hanceU^At its meeting on 17th January, 1963, the Cabinet considered amemorandum by the First Secretary of State (C. (63) 4) to v/hich was annexed the draft of a White Paper refuting the allegation bySir Roy Welensky that the Governments agreement to the secession of nyasaland was in breach of pledges given by United Kingdom ministers at the Constitutional Conference in 1953 which had resulted in theestablishment of the Federation.2.       The Cabinet, at their meeting, invited the First Secretary ofState, in consultation with me and with the Minister without Portfolio,to re-draft the White Paper on the lines indicated by the Prime minister when summing up the discussion (C. C. (63) 4th Conclusions, Minute 5).3.       It proved impossible for the First Secretary to re-draft theWhite Paper before he left for Central Africa.    At his request, therefore,I have prepared a re-draft in consultation with the Minister of Health andthe Minister v/ithout Portfolio and this is attached.4.       I expect that my colleagues will recently have received a pamphlet,which has been published by the Federal Government, entitled &quot;federation and Nyasaland:  the British Governments broken pledges and theconsequences&quot;.    This document, which I understand has been circulatedto all Members of Parliament, simply contains extracts from speechesby Sir Roy Welensky in the Federal Assembly on 19th and 20th December,1962, by certain of the Peers who spoke in the debate in the House of lords on 19th December, 1962, and the Questions and Answers in the House ofCommons on 20th December, 1962.    The publication of this pamphlet may give rise to pressure for early publication of the White Paper.5.       I invite my colleagues to approve the draft White Paper annexed tothis memorandum, subject to any comments that may be received from theFirst Secretary.   I would then wish to show it to Lords Chandos andSwinton to see if they agree with it.    I do not feel any decision as to thetime of publication can now be reached but that it is advisable that this paper should be in a pretty finished state in case publication at short notice becomes necessary.D.House of Lords, S. W. L23rd January, 1963
Draft White PaperonThe Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland
DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON THE FEDERATION OF rhodesia and NYASALAND1. The assertion has been made that, in 1953, during the course of theConference on the Federation of Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (which preceded the formation of the Federation) a pledge was given by british ministers to the effect that no major change in the Federation would bemade by the United Kingdom Government and Parliament without theconsent of the Governments of the Federation, of the two Rhodesias and of nyasaland. The accusation has also been made that in accepting in principlethat Nyasaland should be allowed to withdraw from the Federation, her majesty&apos;s Government propose to act unilaterally in defiance of undertakings given in 1953 that the Federation would be permanent.2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government has decided, after consultation with theother Governments concerned, that it is necessary in order to rebut the charges of bad faith to make public the confidential documents, passages from whichhave already been made public, which are relied upon in support of the allegations that such a pledge and &quot;such undertakings were given.3.   The assertion is based upon:(i) The minutes of the 13th Meeting of the Conference and(ii) The verbatim record of the Meeting.4.   The Minute in question is short and reads as follows:&quot;Extract from the Minutes of the Thirteenth Meeting held onMonday, 19th January, 1953.3.  Review of Constitution(Previous reference: C.A.F. (53) 12th Meeting, Minute 3)Mr. Eastwood suggested that the clause providing for a review ofthe Constitution after not less than seven years, which the conference had accepted at their 12th Meeting (C.A.F. (53) 17) might impair thefinancial credit of the Federation.The general view expressed by delegates was that, since any proposalto terminate the Constitution could only be put into effect with theconcurrence of the Federal Government and all three territorial governments, and of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,it was unlikely that investors would consider the proposed review clausea reflection on the permanence of the Federation.The Meeting:Agreed that no amendment was required in the wording of thedraft clause in paragraph 2 of C.A.F. (53) 17.&quot;5. It should be noted that the subject under consideration was theprovision for review of the Constitution and the question whether such aprovision might impair the financial credit of the Federation.6. The verbatim record of the Meeting summarised in this Minute is asfollows:&quot; Extract from the Verbatim Report of the Thirteenth Meeting heldon Monday, 19th January, 1953.2
&apos; Mr. Eastwood:&apos; Theredsrone point. You remember ;we, were dealing *with the Constitution the other day we dealt with this revision, not beforeseven and not later than nine years. It lias been suggested that that is apossible loophole for secession and if not secession, it might mean voluntaryliquidation. Could anything be read into it at.all. Is it likely..to,.beinferred by the financial world? - -Mr. Lyttelton: I have not got the words in mind.  I do not think you can review a Constitution off the map. It is a question of review.[Mr. Welensky: A/review of the whole Constitution.Mr. Eastwood: Does that infer that there could be a possible voluntaryliquidation? .V-.-Mr. Lyttelton: I should not have thought it went as far as that...; v is-Mr. Eastwood: I hope not. . . ...........-Mr. Lyttelton: The point being that the review was not earlier thanthe seventh or later than the ninth and the Constitution would.put intothe field of discussion total liquidation of the Constitution.A Delegate: A suggestion has been made for a review of the workingof the Constitution.Mr. Lyttelton: I think that would perhaps be safer.Mr. Hopkinson: I think this is very valuable.Mr. Eastwood: I do not want to convey anything which might impedeour credit.Mr. Welensky: . . . the review.   This may envisage the completebreak-up of the Federation.Mr. Unsworth: The working of the provisions of the Constitution.Mr. Lyttelton: You might knock them all out one by one.Lord Swinton: You would not, would you, because the Constitutionwill be enacted to get a constitutional amendment. Supposing the actualreview said on the whole those who are conducting the review, all four governments, that certain variations in the Constitution are desirable.The way I imagine that those alterations would have to be put intoforce should be, would it not, by amendment to the Constitution passed through the Federal Assernbly, is that not so?Mr. Welensky: Yes.Mr. Lyttelton: Nothing can liquidate the Constitution unless all fourare agreed on it. I think in those circumstances that working of theConstitution would be more sensible. I do not think you can add theother without the agreement of all four Governments.Mr. Whitehead: Might I suggest that I do think there is a certainfinancial risk in this. People are bound to ask what is going to happen if they cannot agree when this review body meets. Would it be possibleto say what amendments may be desirable at the end of the period Offreezing?Mr. Lyttelton : My only comment on that is that you are alreadytalking about credit and finance. You are talking with instructed people and not with public opinion uninformed.   We must have an assurance3
from the lawyers that anything that is put in in this thing does notabrogate what I consider to be. the present position which is I thinkthat without the unanimous consent of the four Governments in fact theConstitution could not be liquidated, and therefore whether you are-going to borrow your next 25 millions this is an argument which we hope they will understand but I do not think the electorate of Aldershotwill quite frankly. I think that is the answer.Lord Swinton: I think it is all right and I think after all there hasbeen a good deal of trouble in getting this in. Our anxiety was that weall thought that it was a good thing to have a review and that you didnot put it in the early years because then people might try to make it not work the thing will have been working for at least seven years.Mr. Welensky: If you added the word &apos; working&apos; it would improve the matter, would it not?Lord Swinton: I am not sure that &apos; working&apos; would because you dowant amendments to come in.Mr. Welensky: What is the actual wording now, does anybodyremember it off-hand?Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray: In not less than seven nor more thannine years from the said date there shall be a Conference consisting ofrepresentatives of the Federation, the three Territories and the UnitedKingdom, chosen by the respective Governments for the purpose ofreviewing the Constitution of the Federation.Mr. Lyttelton: I think it is quite safe from the credit point of view,Prime Minister, I think we might leave it as it is..: Mr. Welensky : I think we lose sight of one thing, that other than forthe Legislative List other amendments can be made, so we are notinterfering with that. It is only the Legislative List that is frozen. Theunfreezing applies to that, but the review, as I understand, is going to bea review of everything now.Mr. Lyttelton : I think it has attractions as it is.Mr. Whitehead: If you are satisfied and the legal people are satisfiedwe are quite happy.Mr. Lyttelton: I think the position is that you cannot upset theConstitution without agreement, can you?Mr. Greenfield: You could not do so constitutionally without the intervention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government here.Lord Swinton: That is a risk you always run in a sense, that it wouldbe possible I suppose for Her Majesty&apos;s Government if they could persuade Parliament to do it to pass an Act of Parliament tomorrow morning to take away the whole of responsible government from SouthernRhodesia and the whole of the functions which would be given to theFederation. You cannot legislate against the United Kingdom Parliamentgoing off its head.Mr. Lyttelton: That is Mr. Greenfield&apos;s point, it is the other wayround. He means that as long as it requires the intervention of HerMajestyV Government the lender is safe.   Nobody is safe from the4
Sovereign Government repudiating its obligations. In this case therewould have to be four people to do it.Mr. Greenfield: In this case it is &apos; the Lord giveth and the Lord takethaway&apos;:. Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray:&apos; If I might suggest a further form&apos;of words, something like this: &apos; When reviewing the working of the, Constitution and considering any alterations in matters of detail . . .&apos;.Mr. Lyttelton: That is right off the point, there are no details in a constitution. I am afraid that will not do at all. We are proposing toleave these words as they are, all we are asking the lawyers for is an assurance that, with the concurrence of each and all of the Governmentsconcerned, major alterations could take place in the Constitution.Lord Swinton: Is there anything ready for us tomorrow, for aplenary?Mr. Lyttelton: Yes, a report by the Finance Committee on mattersoutstanding.  There will be a plenary at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow.(The proceedings were then adjourned.)10 Carlton House Terrace, S.W. 1,27th January, 1953.&quot;7. This record which is the basic document (as the Minute only seeks to summarise its effect) shows:(a) That the discussion was initiated by Mr. Eastwood, a Member of theSouthern Rhodesian delegation who raised the question whether the review provision was a &quot; possible loophole for secession &quot; or &quot; voluntaryliquidation &quot; and whether it might not in consequence impair the credit of the Federation.(b) That thereafter the discussion only related to what might happen at the review and the question what amendments, if any, could be broughtabout through the review.(c) That after Lord Swinton had mentioned the possibility that the four governments (namely the Governments of the Federation, of the twoRhodesias and of Nyasaland) might desire certain amendments,Mr. Lyttleton made it clear that at such a review the Constitution couldnot be liquidated or upset by the Territorial Governments and theFederal Government unless all four were agreed.(d) That Mr. Greenfield, then Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice in southern Rhodesia and a delegate from Southern Rhodesia, and nowMinister of Justice of the Federation, then stated that this could notbe done constitutionally without the intervention of a fifth Government,that of the United Kingdom, and by a later intervention he made itclear that in his view the United Kingdom, having created theFederation, could terminate its existence.(e) That the discussion was chiefly about what, under the Constitution,might be done by the Territories and the Federation at the review, andthat the views expressed were in relation to that and not to the exerciseof power by the United Kingdom Parliament.5
8. Accordingly the statements made at the Conference cannot&apos; beconstrued as constituting a pledge by the British Ministers,to the effect thatno change in the Federation would be made by the United Kingdom withoutthe consent of the four Governments, and indeed until 1962 there was no suggestion that such a pledge has been given.9. Such a pledge by Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have meant thatthe Federal Government and each of the Territorial Governments would havebeen given a permanent veto whereby any one of them could insist on the indefinite perpetuation of the Federation established in 1953 whatever, mightbe the views of the United Kingdom Government and of the other three governments.10.., No. trace, of. such a pledge, can be found in any public document,in any contemporaneous announcement, or in the Constitution itself,Article 29 (7) of which provides that &quot;nothing in this&apos;Cc^titutiori shallaffect any power to make laws for the Federation or any of the Territoriesconferred on Her Majesty by any Act of the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom &quot;. If such a pledge of such vital importance was given therewas no reason and no justification for secrecy with regard to it. Referenceto it could have been made in the preamble to the Constitution and some,qualification could have been made to the language of Article 29(7).11. [Pledges which were given by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relationto the safeguarding of the Protectorate status of the inhabitants of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland and with regard to preventing amalgamation ofthe territories, except in certain circumstances, were, as the then colonial secretary made clear in the House of Commons, embodied in the Constitution.He said :&quot; The effective way, which we have adopted is to safeguard the protectorate status of the Northern Territories by constructing the federal constitution in such a way that these Territories remain separate anddistinct political entities independent of the Federation within theirrespective spheres, and continue to be under the responsibility of theSecretary of State for the Colonies and, too, subject to the authority ofHer Majesty in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. This, I can assure the House, the Federal Constitution certainly does. I say in the clearest terms that it will not be competent to interfere with theconstitutional position of either of these Territories, or, for that matter, ofSouthern Rhodesia.   So much for the Protectorate status.The effective method of preventing amalgamation except in certaincircumstances is to secure, as the Federal Constitution does, that her majesty&apos;s Government and, in certain circumstances, Parliament, havethe last word on constitutional amendments. This Government andfuture Governments will be under an obligation not so to amend it unless they are satisfied that a numerical majority of the people concerned arein favour of it. Their intentions are clearly set forth in the Preamble,the fourth paragraph of which makes it quite clear that without a numericalmajority of the people amalgamation is ruled out. The effective safeguard,however, is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament have thelast word on constitutional amendments.&quot;]6
12. It is further alleged, as mentioned in paragraph 1, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment gave undertakings in 1953 that the Federation would be permanent. In support of these allegations reliance has been placed on thefact that the Constitution does not contain any provision conferring a rightof secession, and on a statement made by the then Commonwealth Secretary(Lord Swinton) at the 1953 Conference, endorsing the view that no such provision should be made. The statement made by Lord Swinton is printedbelow.*This omission is not relevant, for the existence of an undertaking orguarantee of the permanence of Federation cannot be inferred from itsomission.13. It was, of course, the purpose and desire of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in endorsing the Federal scheme in 1953 that a stable and lasting form of association between the three territories should be created.This was clearly and publicly stated at the time. Her Majesty&apos;s Government,however, were in no position to give and did not give any undertaking orguarantee as to its permanency.14. The responsibility of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for the inhabitants of Nyasaland remained unimpaired by the establishment of the Federation.The preamble to the Constitution recites:&quot; And whereas Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should continue,under the special protection of Her Majesty, to enjoy separate governments for so long as their respective peoples so desire . . .&quot;* Extract of Statement from the 1953 Conference record by the then commonwealth secretary (Lord Swinton).&quot; I know no Federal Constitution within the Commonwealth, or indeed I thinkoutside it, in which a secession clause is to be found, and there must be very good reasons for that, particularly when one remembers that there have been both withinthe Commonwealth and outside it, great jealousies of State and provincial rights whenfederation took place, yet great as those sectional, and provincial interests wereterritorially, never was such a clause inserted in the Constitution measures, except,which is delightful, Mr. Hopkinson reminds me, within the Soviet Union. It wouldbe right to describe a claim to secede as a precursor of liquidation. After all, itwould be, would it not, rather an odd way of starting to make a success of federation to insert in the document of Constitution of federation, in the foregroundof it an invitation to secede. It is rather like a marriage service in which the minister after uniting the parties, immediately drew their very active attention to the facilitiesfor divorce which were available to them. Divorce figures very prominently in the newspapers, but I think most of us do not believe married life is founded on theprospect of divorce, and I think that is as true of political partnerships as it is of other social ones. At a time when we all want everyone to concentrate on makingfederation a success and bringing the union into the most real partnership, it wouldbe odd to invite people to look to secession, but there is one absolutely over-ridingeconomic objection to this which rules it out from the very start. The federationhas got to raise loans and to raise them on federal assets and federal securities. make no mistake about it if you doubt my words ask anybody in the City of London federation could never raise a penny of money by loan if it was not known whetherfederation was to continue, and therefore whatever views you take about what I may call the moral side of the thing, there is an economic argument to which there can beno possible answer.&quot;[Note. The words in italics were omitted from the extract already published.]7
To disregard the expressed wish of the majority of the inhabitants of nyasaland to withdraw from the Federation would, in the view of her majesty&apos;s Government, be a breach of its obligation to the people of thatProtectorate.Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept that what was said in thediscussions quoted as to the effect that the inclusion of a provision for review in the Constitution might have on the credit of the Federation precludesthem from discharging their responsibility to the inhabitants of a territory under the special protection of Her Majesty.
