C. (63) 322 7th February, 1963CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general  reported to the Cabinet on 14th February that the Farm price review Committee had reached agreement that our opening position inthe review with the Farmers&apos; Unions would be-to propose changesamounting to an overall cut in the value of the guarantees, for reviewpurposes, of about  13 million (out of a maximum possible cut underthe Agriculture Acts of  23 million).    Together with cost increases of 12 million, this would mean that the farmers would be left with none of their &quot;efficiency increase&quot;, conventionally estimated at  25 million.In the event, these proposals were slightly modified, on the recommenda-tion of the negotiating team, and the schedule presented to the Farmers&apos;Unions provided for an overall reduction of about  11. 3 million.2.      The farmers countered with demands for very substantial increases.    They also put in at the last minute a proposal for a revision of the milk scheme, to include a bonus for restrainingproduction, on the lines set out at Annex A.     This is estimated toproduce an increase in the farmers&apos; income of  25. 7 miI3ion in a year,the cost of this falling on the consumer (-grd. a pint on milk).    TheMinister of Agriculture considers that, if we are to get an agreed review,we shall have to move some way to meet them.    He has suggestedthat we should now aim to reach agreement on changes involving anet reduction of just under  2 million as in the schedule at Annex B.He also thinks that we should undertake to consider the milk bonusscheme for introduction later, if it or something like it stood up toexamination.3,      The Farm&apos;Price Review Committee were unable to reach agreement on these proposals.     Those supporting them argued that it was important to get an agreed review if the co-operation of the Unions was to besecured in working out the radical changes in agricultural supportpolicy that would b$ required later; that we should need to go as faras this to achieve an agreed review, and, in particular that some concession on milk was essential to an agreed settlement.    It wasalso argued that the farmers should be allowed to retain a proportionof the estimated efficiency increase; that actual farm incomes had fallen;  and that these incomes would also be reduced by a further 6 million not reflected in the review arithmetic.COPY NO.-1-A A VB IFI IW I^Pt A BriiAjrcrc b 1mb.

Those opposing the proposals pointed out that Exchequer supportwas estimated to cost  41 million more this year than last;  that production generally was increasing and should be restrained;  that inparticular the proposed increase in the guaranteed price for milk in1963-64 would tend to stimulate the continued rise in milk production;that the Unions&apos; milk bonus scheme wao a device for making theconsumer pay the farmers a substantial sum in order that they shouldnot increase production, and that the Exchequer, as a purchaser of milk for school children, etc., would have to pay a share of this estimatedat about  2 million.5.      The Cabinet is therefore asked to decide whether:(i) an increased price for milk of jd. gallon would be acceptable as part of the result of this Review;(ii) we should state that we will undertake to considerthe Unions&apos; milk scheme outlined in Annex A;(iii)  a figure of the order of  1. 8 million would be acceptable for the overall reduction in the valueof the guarantees.J.A.

Annex APROPOSAL BY THE NATIONAL FARMERS&apos; UNIONS FORA MILKJ3ONUS scheme.      The stated objective of the Unions&apos; proposal is a higher income for milk producers, without encouraging increased production.   in essence, the Unions propose that a bonus of 3d. per gallon should bepaid on a proportion of the sales of those producers whose total sales in 1963-64 lay between 98 per cent and 101 per cent of their sales inthe best year of the last three years.    A bonus of 3jd. per gallon wouldbe paid to those whose s ales were below 98 per cent of this figure.The proportion of the sales on which the bonus would be paid to thosequalifying would be the same proportion as that which the standard quantity, to which the present milk guarantee relates, bears to totalproducers&apos; sales as aggregated on the &quot;best of the last three years&quot;basis.    The bonus would be paid after the end of 1963-64 on the basisof a statement by the Milk Marketing Boards of their respectivequalifying gallonages.     Producers who sold more than 1 per cent abovetheir best production year would get no bonus.     During the year 1963-64,all producers would receive the pool price for their milk, calculated onthe present basis.2.      The scheme as put forward would require an increase in the guaranteed price (now 37. 85d. per gallon) of 3d. per gallon on theUnited Kingdom standard quantity and v/ould cost about  25 million ayear.    This is equivalent to an average of roughly  180 per registeredproducer in the United Kingdom.-3-
