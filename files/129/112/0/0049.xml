Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1963C. (63) 49 Copy No.   5 214th March, 1963CABINETMONSIEUR BIDAULTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department mI would value the views of the Cabinet on tlic action to be taken shouldM. Bidault (or one of his principal associates) openly seek admission to this country.We must also reckon with the possibility that he may again enter surreptitiouslyand then reveal himself.2. Under the Aliens Order a person who is refused leave to land may besent away forthwith either to the country from which he came or to his own country; or, if some third country is willing to receive him, he can of course beallowed to proceed thither. An alien already in this country can (apart from action under the Extradition Acts) only be deported to his own country, or to another country which is willing to receive him.3. Plainly M. bidault&apos;s presence in this country, even if he remained politicallyinactive, would tend to embarrass us in our relations with France. I think therefore that if he came openly he should be refused leave to land, so long as it was possiblefor him to be sent or to go to some country other than France.4. We should, however, be faced with a most difficult decision shouldM. Bidault seek admission to this country (or enter surreptitiously and then revealhimself) in circumstances in which the only alternative to admitting him was tosend him to France. The Extradition Acts forbid the surrender of a person chargedwith an offence of a political character. It seems unlikely, therefore, that ifM. Bidault were in this country the French Government could claim his extradition.Indeed, he might well be able to make out a good claim to political asylum, whichis traditionally granted to a person arriving in Britain who in his own country would be in a danger as regards life or liberty on political grounds.5. A refusal of leave to land which had the effect of compelling his returnto France would not amount to extradition, but there is no escaping the fact thatit would appear and be represented as a denial of the safeguards embodied in theExtradition Acts and a departure from our liberal traditions. We would not find it easy to persuade public opinion that a refusal was right, if refusal meant thathe could go nowhere except to France.6. My conclusion, therefore, is that should M. Bidault or one of his principalassociates seek entry to this country (a) if possible, he should be sent to a country other than France, but(b) if not, in the last resort we should be prepared to admit him.H. B.Home Office, S.W.1,13th March, 1963.2232
