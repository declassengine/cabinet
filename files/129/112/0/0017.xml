If HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)2^16311712th February, 1963COPY NO.5 2CABINETDEFENCE WHITE PAPER 1963Attached for the approval of my colleagues is a draftof the Statement on Defence for 1963.    I am putting it forwardthis year as a very short covering note to the memorandaprepared by the three Service Ministers in explanation of theirown Estimates.     I do not regard it as necessary to issue alengthy White Paper on defence policy every year.     There may beoccasions when this is desirable;  otherwise I would regard it assufficient and appropriate to cover broad policy questions in theDefence Debate in the House of Commons.P. T.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.12th February, 1963
STATEMENT ON DEFENCE, 1963The New ,Fojrm of. the-White- Paper^This annual Statement on Defence is presented in a new form.The Memoranda prepared by the three Service Ministers to accompanytheir Estimates have been brought together in one volume, prefacedby this short introductory statement.    A note on Civil Defence isalso included.2.      The publication of the Statement on Defence and the service estimates Memoranda in a single volume is a reflection of the factthat our defence organisation is now indivisible.    Every development in strategic thought shows that the three Services, though they still have and will continue to have distinctive roles, must always operate in the closest possible collaboration with each other.    This outlookmust be fostered at every level from the top to the bottom of our defence forces and organisation.3.     It is with this in mind that the Government have decided on afresh examination of the central organisation for defence, which inits present form dates from the White Paper of 1958.    In studyingthis problem it will be helpful to the Government to have availableoutside advice and experience.    Lord Ismay and Sir Ian Jacob, whowere both concerned in the setting up of the Ministry of Defence afterthe war, have been invited, and have agreed, to assist in the study,which is now proceeding.Finance,4.      The Defence Budget in 1963-64 will amount to  1, 837 million.This seems, and is, a large sum of money by any standards.    Butit continues to represent about 7 per cent of the Gross national product, which is the proportion which we have been devoting to defence for several years now.    The amount which we may spend infuture must depend upon the extent and range of our commitments.
