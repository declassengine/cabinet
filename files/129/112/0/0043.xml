Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1963 .C. (63) 43 Copy No.    5211th March, 1963CABINETTHE FUTURE FINANCING OF UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPINGOPERATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in the paper submitted to the Cabinet on 28th February (C. (63) 29-C.C. (63)14th Conclusions, Item 7) I set out the background to the question of financingUnited Nations peace-keeping operations and made certain recommendations for financing these operations for 1963 and for long-term arrangements. I recommendedthat for the rest of 1963 we should accept a system based on compulsory assessmentson condition that any agreement on such a basis was not taken as a precedent andmust be linked with the establishment of a system for future years. We have nowinstructed our Mission in New York to proceed on these lines.2. It is on the question of future financing of special operations that I seek the views of my colleagues. Our approach to this question has been governed by two main considerations:i\) The importance of making, and being seen to make, an effort to reach asolution whereby the Soviet bloc and France might conceivablyco-operate in the future and so avoid the danger of precipitating a crisis in the Organisation by their becoming liable to loss of vote underArticle 19 of the Charter. If Russia and China were out of the united nations, taking the bloc countries with them, a most serious crisiswould arise.(ii) The need to prevent a situation arising in the future where we might be faced with the alternative either of supporting financially an operationof which we disapproved (and defending our action in Parliament) orof refusing to pay up our assessed contribution and thus puttingourselves in breach of our obligations under the Charter.3. Two possible solutions have been put forward, one by the Lord chancellor and one by myself. My proposal was described in general terms in paragraph 10 (iii)of C. (63) 29.Lord Chancellors scheme. The Lord Chancellor proposes that, when initiating a peace-keepingoperation, the General Assembly should agree:(i) to impose a limit on the amount of expenditure that the Secretary-Generalcould incur and which could be subjected to a compulsory assessment;(ii) if it becomes apparent that expenditure is likely to exceed the limit imposed,the Assembly&apos;s authority must be sought for any further funds, whichshould again be subject to a limit. The possibility of making voluntary contributions would not be excluded.5. This is similar to the present system, where the budget is voted in advance and the Secretary-General is authorised by the Assembly to spend up to a certainlimit for a fixed period but has the advantage of a clear decision at the time whenthe operation is authorised of determining how the money is to be found. Itdoes not, however, solve the difficulties referred to in paragraph 2 above.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT,2218
Foreign Office scheme. This was to be a part-compulsory part-voluntary scheme and wouldinvolve:(i) financing the first part of the costs of any operation up to a certain limit,say $20 million (A), by compulsory assessment based partly on theregular scale, partly on a special scale, the rest either by compulsoryassessment or by voluntary contribution;(ii) the creation of a Financing Committee of the Assembly which should include the five permanent members of the Security Council.7. This scheme might have some attraction for the Russians and the French,because they would only be committed initially to part of the total cost. However,if additional sums were to be provided on a strictly voluntary basis there would beno guarantee that they would be forthcoming. To overcome this objection anarrangement might be made that those who voted in favour of an operation shouldbe deemed to undertake to make additional contributions up to say another$20 million (B). These members would then be obliged to pay that sum accordingto a scale of contributions apportioned by the General Assembly. Before theSecretary-General could spend more than A and B he would have to go to the financing Committee.8. Under its rules of procedure the Financing Committee would function inthe following manner:(i) The Assembly having authorised the Secretary-General to act in a certainsituation would ask the advice of the Committee on the methods of financing the operation beyond the total of A and B above.(ii) A recommendation of the Committee to the Assembly that the operation should be financed (apart from A and B) entirely on a compulsorybasis would have to be by a two-thirds majority, including the favourable vote of the five permanent members of the Security Council.(iii) If on exhaustion of A and B further cash was not forthcoming, either asa result of compulsory assessment or promise of voluntary contribution,the operation would have to stop.9. This solution does not, of course, guarantee that possible politicaldefaulters will co-operate but it does make it easier for them to do so and it allowsus some measure of flexibility in the event of the Assembly embarking on someoperation of which we disapprove.10. I therefore seek the consent of my colleagues to instruct our representative on the Working Group to consult with other members of the Groupwith a view to seeking a solution to the problem of future financing on the basisof the proposal at paragraph 4 subject to the elaborations in paragraphs 7 and 8.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,11th March, 1963.
