HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.     5210th January, 1963CABINETTHE YEMENNote by the Secretary of the Cabinet.The attached memorandum has been prepared at the Prime Minister&apos;.sdirection in order to set out the factors which need to be taken into account in considering whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government should give earlyrecognition to the Republican regime in the Yemen.2.      On the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions this paper is being circulated for the information  of the Cabinet.(Signed) BURKE trend cabinet Office, S.W.1.9th January, 1963.THE YEMENM^emorjmj^m^y^ Officials-A-&apos;   Points in favour of early recognition of the YemeniRepublicans(i) Failure to recognise soon, particularly in view of the recognition by the United States, the old Commonwealth and Italy, the acceptance ofthe Republicans for the Yemeni seat in the United Nations and the resumption of relations with Saudi Arabia, would be interpreted by the republicans as open hostility and would encourage them to devoteparticular attention to subversion in AdenQ(ii) Similarly, delay in recognition, while we go ahead with the resumption of relations with Saudi Arabia, will be taken by the Presidentof the United Arab Republic, President Nasser, as showing that our policy is determined by opposition to him and to the forces working for-1-SEC&amp;ET
change in the Arab world.    Whatever we may think of President Nasser,it would be damaging to our interests if he were to be encouraged toconspire more directly against us in Kuwait (where increasingEgyptian penetration is reported), Libya and elsewhere.    He canin the long run do us a lot of harm generally in the Arab world.In the short run, he can reinforce what Brigadier Sallal, the leader of the new regime in the Yemen, can do to undermine our positionin Aden by appealing to the population to oppose merger and bycalling on them for acts of subversion.    On the other hand, earlyrecognition would enable us to show President Nasser that wewere not taking sides against him and would increase our ability,with the Americans, to influence him.(iii) Early recognition would facilitate continued close co-operation with the United States Government in restraining the republicans from causing trouble in Aden and in handlingPresident Nasser.    The United States Government in various waysare now pursuing a more active policy to ensure stability in theMiddle East (and thereby taking more responsibility in the area,which is to be welcomed).    They delayed their recognition several weeks in an endeavour to protect our position in Aden and introduced into their announcement a helpful reference to the Treaty of Sana&apos;ato show that they accepted our interpretation of the Treaty.    Ifwe delay recognition we shall risk forfeiting their very valuablehelp in the future.    Looking ahead this may be of great importancein the Persian Gulf.(iv) Delay in recognition will not make the eventual decisionany easier to explain to those to whom it will not be welcome.Nor would it be likely to alter fundamentally the position inside the yemen (the policy which is theoretically possible of providingactive help to the Yemeni Royalists would not be politicallypossible).(v) If we recognise soon, there is some chance that it mightbe possible eventually to get at least the main body of Egyptian troopsout of the Yemen.     This is the United States objective, but thereis no possibility of achieving it so long as the Royalists think theyhave support from outside, a belief which our non-recognition islikely to encourage.(vi) If we do not recognise soon our representative in Taizis likely to be expelled from the country, thus reducing ouropportunities for bringing influence to bear on the YemeniRepublicans to maintain quiet on the frontier with the Federation.Experience in Arabia shows that, once relations are broken, itcan take a very long time before they are resumed.
(i)       The military situation has in recent weeks developed infavour of the Royalists.     They are within about 35 miles of Sana&apos;ato the eastward, and their advance has only been held by the despatchof reinforcements from Egypt.    The morale of the Egyptian troopsis an uncertain factor,,    Some outlying Egyptian garrisons aresurrounded by Royalist forces and can only be supplied by air-During January and February heavy cloud in the Yemeni High-lands will hamper air opearationp.(ii) Although the Republicans control about two-thirds of thecountry, the inhabitants of these areas are largely un-warlike andwould be likely to accept a Royalist regime as meeklyas they have accepted the Republican.     The decisive battle will be fought outin the Central Highlands.(iii) The survival of the Republic is dependent on the presenceof Egyptian forces, at present numbering about 15, 000 men plusair force.    Recognition in the present circumstances would be the recognition of an Egyptian puppet.(iv) Opinion in Aden and in the Aden Protectorate would seeearly recognition in the light of a humiliation for us.   AfterFresident Nasser&apos;s Port Said speech (saying that the Federation ofSouth Arabia ought really to be called the &quot;Federation of SouthBritain&quot;) and Brigadier Sallal&apos;s series of attacks on Britain(described as a &quot;hideous old woman&quot; whose power was finished)the Arab mentality would see recognition as a devastating blow toour prestige and authority.     This point has been made clear to theGovernor of Aden by the Ministers both of the Federation and ofthe Colony, i. e. , the leaders of those moderate elements on whomour agreed tenure of the Aden base depend d.(v) The same elements, though bitterly critical of UnitedStates recognition, have accepted it as logical in terms of a united States policy aimed at building up President Nasser.     they know that this is not the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, andwould see no logic in early United Kingdom recognition.     We should thus risk losing our own identity in their eyes and they would feelthat the independent United Kingdom role in Arabia had beenswallowed up in the Pax Americana.     We can in fact be more use to the Americans themselves if we pursue an independent policy inArabia than if the Arabs conclude that we are their satellites.(vi) While the West, and the United Kingdom, must cleaidycome to terms v/ith the &quot;new Arabs&quot;, this does not mean that theyshould ignore the conservative elements in Arabia which are by no means a spent force.-3-S EC RET
acwu i(vii)      The merger between Aden and the Federation of south arabia is due to be effected soon.     It is vitally important that thenew enlarged Federation should be given a good start.    Earlyrecognition by us of the Yemeni Republic has no prospect of leading to Yemeni recognition of the Federation by way of counterpart.This being so, from the point of view of Aden, it is clearly better to defer recognition, and re-consider it in some months&apos; time whenthe new enlarged Federation has had time to get established.(viii)   The risk of Soviet penetration into the Yemen has beenheld by the United States recognition of the Republic.January, 196 30-4-SECRET
