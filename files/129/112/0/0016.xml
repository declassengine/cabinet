secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1963C. (63) 16   . Copy No.   5212th February, 1963 &apos;   : ;iCABINETSATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of Aviation and the Postmaster-GeneralFollowing the Commonwealth Conference on Satellite Communications lastspring, discussions at official level have taken place with the United States state department and other United States Agencies, and also with the Postal andTelecommunication Administrations of the Western European countries. Thepurpose of these discussions, which were undertaken with the approval of theEconomic Policy Committee, was to give other countries a report on theCommonwealth Conference, and to ascertain their thinking. They were regardedas a preliminary to consideration of the policy which we should adopt.2. The background against which decisions have to be taken may besummarised as follows:(a) The feasibility of satellite communications has been demonstrated by the experimental Telstar and Relay satellites launched by the americans and by the successful operation of the British ground station. Thesesatellites are, however, experimental only, and the successful operationof a commercial satellite communication system has still to be demonstrated.(b) While satellite communications must be integrated with other forms ofinternational communication, such as submarine telephone cables, theyare in some respects different. Submarine cables provide links between two countries, whereas a system of communication satellites can provide links for the world as a whole.(c) The world character of satellite communications means some change inthe traditional pattern of Commonwealth communications; for manydecades the Commonwealth has owned and exploited its owncommunication system, separate from, but intercommunicating with,the systems of other countries.(d) The United States are far ahead of the rest of the world in the techniquesof manufacture of communication satellites and their launching, andon present form the first commercial satellites will be American.(e) The United Kingdom and several European countries are making asubstantial investment in the European Launcher development organisation (ELDO), and we must ensure that nothing is done to prejudice the use of the ELDO Launcher.(/) The declared object of the United States, as embodied in the communication Satellite Act passed at the end of August 1962 is toestablish, as soon as practicable, a global system capable of serving allcountries. The Americans expect that a commercial system will be inoperation in about four years.(g) Traffic between Europe (including the United Kingdom) and north america represents 80 per cent of the total inter-continental traffic,and this preponderance is likely to continue for a long time.   The2087
commercial viability of satellite communications will be largely dependent on traffic between North America and Europe. If the americans are first in space, if we were to stand aside from an american system and if as might well be the case Europe did not,this would be bound to damage us financially.; (h) By their very nature international communications require co-operation byvfc-V the countries concerned in their development; and in interpreting the declared objective described in (/) above, United States officials havestressed that there is no intention of the United States going it alone, andthat their object is international collaboration in construction, ownership and management.(/) Our defence requirements must be provided for. The armed forces would naturally expect to use the facilities provided by a civil satellite,communication system, although this would not meet their full requirements.3. We now need to decide on the policy we should follow because we must expect the Americans to come forward with proposals in the near future. It is recommended that we should proceed as follows:(a) The United Kingdom, as a traditional world leader in internationalcommunication, should now take the lead in trying to formulateEuropean views to take advantage of the bargaining strength providedby the potentialities of the ELDO launcher. In these discussions theUnited Kingdom Government would not exclude the possibility of asecond system based on the ELDO launcher.(b) If it were so decided we should be prepared to negotiate with the UnitedStates and other countries for participation in a world-wide system on the understanding that we can achieve satisfactory financial arrangements and be assured that our participation will give us theright to join in the formulation of policy and management and the chance of providing part of the system.(c) If, however, we failed to obtain what we regard as satisfactory arrangements in a projected world-wide system, we should seek to establish a separatesystem in conjunction with Europe and/or the Commonwealth.(d) We should maintain continuous contacts with Commonwealth countriesin order to see that their interests are safeguarded and that the maximumuse is made of the assets represented by the Commonwealthsgeographical spread and by the existing close Commonwealthco-operation in the communications field.(e) We should consider how our defence requirements could best be fittedinto a civil system or systems.(/) Meanwhile, we should examine our programme of research and development on satellite communications to ensure that we are in a position tomake a substantial contribution, either to a world-wide system or toa European and/or Commonwealth system.J. A.R. B.12th February, 1963.
