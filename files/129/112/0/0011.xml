Ir/HlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C,(63) 115th February, 1963COPY NO.52CAEINETTEACHERS&apos; PAY (ENGLAND AND wales the Wages Committee have considered the provisional agree-ment reached by the Burnham main Committee on the pay of full-timequalified primary and secondary school teachers in England andWales.    This has been reported to the Minister of Education,  and made public by the Burnham Committee.    hi view of the political implications I am informing the Cabinet of the conclusions of theWages Committee.Previous Increase in Teacher;sJJPay2.      An increase in teachers1 pay of about 14j per cent, costing 42 million a year, came into effect in January, 1962.    We and thelocal education authorities, though not the teachers, regarded this as providing a substantial measure of betterment in teachers&apos; pay.The Government deliberately fixed no terminal date for the currency of the settlement, and this contributed materially to the teachers&apos;acquiescence in the final award.The Teachers&apos; Claim3.      In June, 1962 the primary and secondary school teacherspresented a new claim totalling  100 million and representing anincrease of&apos;about 25 per cent, to come into effect in April, 1963.The Wages Committee discussed this claim in the autumn and authorised the Minister of Education to allow an increase of up to3. 5 per cent if a negotiated settlement could thereby be achieved.It was agreed that he should aim to secure selective increasesdesigned to avoid increases for young teachers up to the age of about25 and to give increasing amounts to the older teachers together withdifferential increases for posts of responsibility and for special qualifications or training.    It was also agreed that arrangements should be made to absorb two-year trained teachers progressivelyinto the basic scale for three-year trained teachers.-1-
The Present Proposals by the Burnham committee .     The employers on Burnharn main Committee neverthelessaccepted a provisional agreement, which has still to be ratified by theconstituent organisations, which goes substantially farther.    The termsare explained in detail in the Annex.    This is unsatisfactory in two ways:-(i) The increases they have proposed amount in total to 20. 7 million, which is an increase of 6. 7 per centin the salary bill for the teachers concerned.    Theagreement is intended to apply for tv/o years, which means that this increase can be represented as equivalent to increases of 4.6 per cent a year;  but even this figure is still inconsistent with our incomes policy, (especially bearing in mind the very substantial increase which the teachers received only fifteen months previously) though not out of line with somerecent incomes settlements.(ii) Instead of the selective increases which we favour,the bulk of this money is devoted to a flat rate increase for all teachers and only 3 per cent of it to increaseddifferentials for higher qualifications or responsibility.Handling of the proposals.      The Minister of Education has power only to accept or rejectproposals by the Burnham Committee, and cannot vary them.    in considering how this agreement should be treated the Wages committee felt bound to take account of the political implications.     There wasprolonged and bitter political controversy in 1961, which v/ouldcertainly be repeated if the Government were seen for the second time within a single Parliament to be rejecting on the grounds of amounta settlement agreed by both the teachers and the local authorities,particularly when there is a serious shortage of teachers.    Theproposed amount if properly distributed should certainly help to alleviate the shortage by stimulating the recruitment of graduates and return of more married women.6.      There will be public criticism anyway at the rejection of an agreed settlement;  we could however expect support from informedpublic opinion if we were to reject an agreement on the ground thatthe distribution proposed was unsatisfactory.    The scale of increasesadjusted to meet the real needs might produce a lower total amount and we should keep this possibility open.     It is not proposed, there-fore, to start by accepting the total amount and asking for it to beredistributed.    The Minister of Education will therefore concentrate on getting sensible revised scales worked out without expressing prior view on the amount.    But it is considered that if the burnham committee puts the point directly, it will be unwise to tell them thatthe total of  20. 7 million is unacceptable in itself, and that if satisfactory scales are formulated which still amount to this totalwe shall have to accept it.
7.      The Wages Committee took the view that it was highly-unsatisfactory that the machinery for determining teachers&apos; payin England and Wales should be such as to put the Government inthis difficult position for the second time and they invited theMinister of Education to produce proposals for its revision afterthe present claim has been settled.R.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.4th February, 1963
TERMS OF PROVISIONAL AGREEMENT,REACHEeTbY THE EURNI-IAM MAIN COMMITTEEON 24th JANUARY, 1963The agreement, which relates to full-time qualified teachers in primary and secondary schools and is to be effective, if ratified,for two years from 1st April, 1963, provides for the following: -Cost in afull year m(1) The basic scales for all teachers to beincreased by  50 at all points.    Thus,for non-graduate teachers with threeyears of education and/or training, thescale is to be  650- l,250 on the presentincremental pattern (including &quot;boosters&quot;)over 16 years.Cost in a full year: 13. 5This new scale compares with one of 775-  1,375 claimed by the teachers andwith the existing scale of  600- l,200.(2) All teachers with less than three years ofeducation and/or training to be assimilateddirectly and immediately to an appropriatethree-year scale, e. g. for non-graduatesthe scale of  650-  1,250 mentioned above.Cost in a full year: 5. 8The employers had previously proposed thatthese teachers should be assimilated to theappropriate basic three-year scale only when they reached the maximum;  this would cost  2. 2m.(3) The employers will support - or, if need be,attempt to initiate - legislation to enableyears of education and training beyond theminimum to count as years of service for pension   purposes.    Pending this, atemporary arrangement will operate toenable all teachers who in the past hadtaken more than two years of education and training to retain their salary leadby granting them a new personal maximum of  30 beyond their appropriate basicthree-year scale, e.g. in the case of anon-graduate of  1,280.Cost in a full year of temporary protection: 0. 8-4-ANNEX
fuii year rri(4) The pay addition awarded forpossession of a good honours degree to be increased from  100 to  120.Cost in a full year: 0. 6(5) Authorities to be given discretion, subjectto limits to be settled, to award allowances for heads of Departments in primary schools (these are already payable in secondary schools).The cost cannot be calculated but is likely ^to be very small: ?m/ 20. 7m-5-
