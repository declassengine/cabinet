\ts documment is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)c. (63) 6 copy no.   SSL18th January, 1963cabinetREPORT by THE JOINT COMMITTEE on house OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Ministerfor Science and the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAs Leaders of the two Houses of Parliament, we have examined the Reportby the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform (H, L. 23, H. C. 38) andat the request of a Committee of Ministers under the chairmanship of thePrime Minister we submit to our colleagues the following considerations.2.       The Joint Committee *s recommendations are summarised in annex ,A&apos;.     They include (sections b (v) and (vi) and (C)) a number of secondary recommendations dealing with Peeresses and with Scottish and irish Peerages.    We have no comment on these recommendations which webelieve might reasonably be accepted by the Government as they stand.3.       The main issues in the Report are those arising from the recommend -ation that a Feer should have the option of surrendering his Peerage.    TheJoint Committee^ recommendations in this field are summarised in sections A and b (i) to (iv) of Annex !A&apos;.     The issues to which we wish todraw attention can be summarised as follows -(i)   The principle of surrender(ii)  The periods allowed for the exercise of the option:  viz. , sixmonths for Peers who have already succeeded and one year for those who subsequently succeed, exceptfor sitting-M. P.&apos;s whowould have to decide in one month(iii)  Loss of titles and other privileges consequent on a surrender(iv)   The period for which the Peerage is surrendered - vis., the lifetime of the person who surrenders.4.       The record of the Joint Committee^ proceedings shows that therecommendations were arrived at only after much difficult argument and inthe face of a number of close divisions.    In particular, the decision to makethe principle of surrender applicable to sitting Peers was arrived at by eleven,votes to ten (with two members of the Committee not voting).    The actualvoting is shown in Annex &apos;b&apos;.    It is likely that a wide range of divergentopinions will be put forward in debate in the two Houses.5.       We do not wish at this stage to make firm recommendations on thequestions of substance at (i) to (iv) of paragraph 3 above.   We believe, however,that if the Government are going to propose legislation, it should be on the-1-SECRET
lines of the Joint Committee&apos;s Report without any amendment on points of substance.    There is a reasonable chance of such legislation passing bothHouses, although this is not a foregone conclusion in the House of Lords.If the Government were to introduce amendments of their own, this would seriously increase the risk of defeat.Parliamentary Procedure6.       The Government should, we suggest, initiate debates in bothHouses, perhaps during February or early in March, on Motions to take note of the Joint Committee&apos;s Report.    In opening these debates theGovernment spokesman would indicate an open mind on the recommendations,on which the views of the two Houses should be expressed in debate beforethe timing and content of any legislation was decided upon.     It would betaken amiss, particularly in the House of Lords, if the Government seemedto have made up their minds in advance.7.       The timing of legislationwi.il need careful planning.    Shouldlegislation be decided upon, it would be desirable for it to pass in timeto take practical effect at but not before the next General Election.Siii  iaJEX -QJLi? on c lus ion. s3.      We conclude that:-(i)   The Government should keep an open mind on themain issues arising from the Joint Committee^recommendations.(ii) Debates should be arranged in both Houses on thelines suggested in paragraph 6.(iii) Subject to any unexpected development in thesedebates, legislation on this subject will bemore likely to succeed if the Joint Committee&apos;srecommendations are adopted without majoralteration.(iv)   Should legislation be decided upon, it should passin time to take practical effect at, but not before,the next General Election.HailshamI.M.18th January, 1963.-2-
