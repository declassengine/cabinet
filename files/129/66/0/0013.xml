Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954CONFIDENTIALCopy No.67C. (54) 6319th February, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETSELECT COMMITTEE ON DELEGATED legislation memorandum by the Lord Privy SealOn 18th December, 1952, the House of Commons ordered:  &quot; That a Select Committee be appointed to consider in what respects theexisting procedures, by which the control of this House over delegated legis-lation is exercised, need to&apos;be improved or supplemented and by what meansthis can best be achieved.&quot;In November 1953 this Select Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. ClementDavies, Q.C,j M.P., published their report (House of Commons Paper No. 310).The Select Committee&apos;s seven recommendations are reproduced in the Annex tothis memorandum, together in each case with the comments of an informal body of officials which has examined them at my request. Both the recommendations and officials&apos; comments upon them have been considered by the Committee of ministers under my chairmanship comprising the Lord President, the Lord Chancellor, theHome Secretary and the Parliamentary and Financial Secretaries to the Treasury.I now submit the Committee&apos;s conclusions for approval by the Cabinet.2. Only two of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations raise issues ofimportance.   The views of the Committee upon these are as follows:  Recommendation (1)The Select Committee did not favour the idea, which I put forward in thecourse of giving evidence before them, of referring &quot; prayers &quot; for considerationby a Committee of the House. Instead, they recommended the adoption of a standing Order under which debate on &quot; prayers &quot; would invariably cease atII - 30 p.m., at which hour Mr. Speaker would either put the question or, where such a course appeared to be justified on certain specified grounds, adjourn the debate until 10 p.m. on the next ordinary sitting day of the House (other than aFriday) when it would again be subject to a similar procedure.This proposal does not find favour with some of our supporters but Oppositionopinion is understood to be generally in favour of trying it out and my committee agreed to recommend its adoption by way of experiment during the remainder ofthe present Session. They considered possible means of ensuring that it shouldnot have the effect of increasing the risk of debate on important &quot; prayers &quot; beingprevented by the expiry of the statutory period of forty days. After consultationwith the Clerk of the House they agreed that, to guard against this danger, thenecessary sessional order should include specific provision for its own suspensionon occasions when suspension would be justified for that purpose.&apos; Recommendation (5)My Committee agreed that the Government would not be justified in holding out any prospect of early legislation to extend the present statutory period of fortydays within which statutory instruments subject to negative resolution remain opento annulment. They considered it to be the more important, however, that means should be found of carrying out the first part of this&apos; recommendation, namely, thatthe statutory forty days should begin to run from the date when copies of a45718b
statutory instrument are available to members generally in the Vote Office. They,therefore, approved the suggestion of officials that the Government should under-take to ensure by administrative means that at least fifty copies of instruments and drafts subject to negative resolution are normally made available in the VoteOffice simultaneously with the &quot;laying&quot; of the instrument, subject to its being understood that there will be exceptional cases of an urgent kind where this willnot be practicable for bona fide reasons of public interest. In such cases a supplyof copies will be made available as soon as possible thereafter.3.   For the rest, the Committee agreed:  (a) that Recommendation (2) of the Select Committee was unacceptable;(b) that Recommendations (3) and (4) could be accepted without difficulty;(c) that, as regards Recommendation (6), steps should be taken to ensure thatall Departments in future included a suitable note in italics at the headof any instrument which would not come into operation and could not,therefore, be registered until certain requirements, Parliamentary orotherwise, had been completed in respect of it;(d) that Recommendation (7), which was based on a misquotation from the donoughmore Committee&apos;s Report, called for no special comment.4. I now invite the Cabinet to endorse the Committee&apos;s conclusions as summarised in this memorandum.H. C.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,19th February, 1954.
ANNEXRecommendations of the Select Committee on Delegated Legislation(House of Commons Paper 310)The seven numbered recommendations of the Select Committee are reproducedbelow together in each case with comments by an informed body of officials:  (1) That, with regard to Statutory Instruments which are subject to the negative Prayer, the procedure shall continue as at present, except that if aprayer is under discussion at 11 - 30 p.m. the Speaker shall at that hour put the question to the House, unless he shall be of opinion that:  (a) owing to the lateness of the time of starting the discussion on theprayer, or(b) owing to the importance of the issues raised by the statutory instrument,time for debate has not been adequate, the debate shall be adjourned to thenext ordinary sitting day of the House (other than a Friday) when it shall be resumed at the end of Government business for that day and it shall be subjectto the same procedure as on the first day (paragraph 105).Of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations this alone is relevant to the prob-lem of protracted sittings to debate &quot; prayers.&quot; It appears to be a generally sensibleproposal which deserves serious consideration by the Government.  Mr. Speakeris understood to have indicated that he is prepared to undertake the responsibility which acceptance of the recommendation would impose upon, him.  The recom-mendation also seems likely to be welcome to the Opposition, many of whose members find it seriously inconvenient when the House sits after 11 - 30 p.m.The drafting of the necessary Standing Order to put it into effect might well raisedifficult procedural problems, for example, the effect upon the proposed arrange-ments of an adjournment upon a matter of urgent public importance under standing order No. 9 which provides that the time occupied by debate upon such a matter should be made up after 10-00 p.m. There may well be other potential difficultiesof a similar kind which would have to be surmounted.------ The view might be held that the necessary Standing Order should providefor only a single adjournment of the debate by Mr. Speaker but on the whole themore flexible arrangement recommended by the Select Committee seems preferablein spite of its obvious inconvenience to Whips from the point of view of their responsibility for Members&apos; attendances.The imposition of such a restriction upon the time for debating &quot;prayers&quot;would make it necessary for Members to table their &quot; prayers &quot; as early as possible if they are to be sure of adequate time for debating them.(2) That the Prayer for the annulment of a Statutory Instrument should set out the reasons for such annulment (paragraph 102).Such an innovation appears to be both undesirable and unnecessary. It wouldbe undesirable because it might create confusion as to the exact issue which theHouse was being asked to debate and &quot;divide&quot; upon. Thus, the vote must, of necessity, be for and against the Order as a whole but the prayer, if it were to setout the reasons for the suggested annulment, might be directed against only onespecified and possibly minor feature of the Order.In some cases the object of the tabling of a &quot;prayer&quot; is nothing morethan to provide an opportunity for discussion of the instrument in question or possibly to obtain clarification of the whole or a part of it. If, therefore, provisionwere to be made for inclusion in the &quot; prayer &quot; of the reasons for the proposed45718 B 2
annulment, this would at least have to be upon an optional and not a mandatorybasis. There might also need to be some safeguard against such a provisioninfringing the practice of the Chair that debate on a &quot; prayer &quot; must not extend to the policy of the Statute under which the relevant statutory instrument wasmade.The recommendation appears to be unnecessary because, where there is a detailed reason for the tabling of a &quot; prayer,&quot; those who require or wish to be aware of this reason have no difficulty in discovering it in practice.(3) That the Scrutiny Committee should not be be made into a StandingCommittee but its appointment at the beginning of each Session should betreated as a matter of urgency.No objection need be raised to this recommendation which, in fact, repre-sents the normal practice. There were special reasons for the delay in appointingthe Scrutiny Committee at the beginning of one recent Session.(4) That the Scrutiny Committee should include with its Report to theHouse any letter from it to a Government Department in which the point in issue on a Statutory Instrument, and the reason for inviting a DepartmentalMemorandum, are indicated, and the Committee should, as now, include alsothe reply of the Department.Counsel to Mr. Speaker, whose assistance is available to the ScrutinyCommittee under their terms of reference, foresees no theoretical or practical difficulty about giving effect to this recommendation.(5) That the period of forty days shall commence from the day when theStatutory Instrument is available to Members in the Vote Office and that thedate when it is so available be placed thereon; but that where the ScrutinyCommittee in their Report draw the particular attention of the House to a statutory Instrument, then the time shall be ten days from the date when theReport of that Committee is made or the statutory forty days, whichever time is the longer (paragraph 98).The object of the first part of this recommendation is clearly to enableMembers to derive full advantage from the period of forty days within which a&quot;prayer &quot; for the annulment of an instrument has to be tabled. The existing arrangements are apparently unsatisfactory in that there is sometimes an appreciable delay between the date of the &quot; laying &quot; of the instrument (i.e., when a small number of copies, dated in ink, are handed in), from which date the periodof forty days at present begins to run, and the date when bulk supplies of copiesof the instrument are available for Members generally in the Vote Office. It is,therefore, recommended that the forty, day period should in future begin to runfrom the latter date, which should accordingly be shown on the face of the instrument.v. . It seems that this change might be able to be brought about without legislation by administrative measures to ensure that at least fifty copies of an instrument arein practice made available in the Vote Office simultaneously with the &quot; laying &quot; ofthe&apos; instrument. The Department concerned would be responsible for fixing inadvance, in consultation with the Stationery Office, the date when the instrumentwould be &quot; laid &quot; (including the making available of the necessary number of copiesin the Vote Office) and this date, would be printed on the face of the instrument.In fixing this date in advance the Department might find it necessary to allow,some margin to cover, for example, possible printing delays and adoption of thispr6eediireJmightj therefore;, result in&apos; practice in the deferment of &quot; laying &quot;for some
three days in the average case. Normally, however, the Department would be ableto provide in its time-table for completion of the necessary additional action before&quot;laying.&quot; . ...Legislation would, howeveri be required to implement the second part of thisrecommendation, the intention of which is not clear. If it assumes that in all casesany report of the Scrutiny Committee will have been made within a period of fortydays from the date of &quot; laying &quot; an assumption which has not always in practiceheld good-and, therefore, has as its object the limited one of ensuring that, where such a report is made after the expiry of thirty of the forty statutory days, not lessthan ten more days must elapse before the instrument ceases to be subject toannulment, the object in view could be attained just as effectively and with-out involving difficulties, for example, vis-a-vis the House of Lords, by a straight-forward increase in the number of statutory days from forty to fifty. If, on theother hand, the intention underlying the recommendation is that an instrumentshould be subject to annulment within ten days of the making of a report by the scrutiny Committee, whenever such a report may be made, this would have theeffect that instruments subject to negative resolution would remain indefinitelysubject to annulment owing to the possibility of the submission of a belated reportby the Scrutiny Committee. Such deferment of finality might have serious consequences, for example where the instrument in question provided for themaking of payments which might well be withheld by individuals concerned so longas the instrument remained uncertain in its operation. Furthermore, any provision whereby a statutory period would begin to run from the date when a report of the scrutiny Committee was &quot; made &quot; would raise the question what should constitute the &quot; making &quot; of a report, e.g., should &quot; making &quot; be dependent upon a supply of copies being available for Members in the Vote Office?(6) That at the head of a Statutory Instrument there shall be printed anote stating whether it is subject to the Affirmative or to the Negative prO-cedure or whether it is exempt from both processes (paragraph 103).Most departments already put a suitable note in italics at the head of an instrument which will not come into operation and cannot, therefore, be registereduntil certain requirements, Parliamentary or otherwise, are completed, e.g., instru-ments laid in draft and requiring affirmative resolution. Steps can be taken toensure that all departments do this. This procedure is simple because it comesbefore final publication of the Statutory Instrument so that the note can beremoved when the Statutory Instrument is printed for publication.Such procedure would, however, be a considerable imposition if applied toinstruments laid after making and subject to negative resolution procedure(i.e., those to which Section 5 of the Statutory Instrument Act, 1946 applies) orlaid with immediate effect but requiring affirmative resolution as a condition ofcontinuance. If instruments in these two categories had notes printed at the headthese notes would appear on all copies printed and sold, or issued, up till the date(which might never occur and which would anyhow not be a logical occasion forchange) when a reprint was called for. A possible alternative means of securing theobject of the recommendation would be by overprinting, or stamping of the Parlia-mentary copies only but this would involve additional work for officials of the two houses and create opportunities for errors.The minimum number of copies of any Statutory Instrument disposed of is750; figures of 4-5,000 are frequent; food rationing orders usually take 9-lf),0pOcopies, and purchase tax order 15-20,000. National Health Service (ServiceCommittees and Tribunals) Amendment Regulations, 1953 (S.I. 1953 /1175), the&quot;best-seller&quot; for 1953, took 44,000 copies, and that figure was not a record. few of the users are interested in whether a: Statutory Instrument is, or was, subject to affirmative or negative resolution procedure. Queen&apos;s printers copies may goon being used for many years; The presence of the italicised note would distortthe &quot; lay-out &quot; of page 1: of the instrument;! to..: which considerable attention ,hasbeen given.  It would also reduce the available space on the page and might
1algive the.impression to a person unfamiliar with Parliamentary procedure that the instrument was still subject to annulment after it had ceased to be so.The category which is required to be laid before Parliament but which isexempt, both from negative and from affirmative resolution procedure is verysmall, both for instruments.laid in draft and for instruments laid after making.If a Member of Parliament sees a statement at the head of a statutory instrument that it was laid before Parliament on a certain date and there is no note on it indicating that it is subject to affirmative resolution, he can assume, in thegreat majority of cases, that it is subject to negative resolution and that the forty-day period runs from the date of laying.(7) That the recommendations made by the Donoughmore Committeein paragraph 15, page 64, of their Report be endorsed, namely, that theexpressions &quot; regulation, rule, order &quot; should not be used indiscriminately to describe the Instruments by which the law-making power conferred on ministers by Parliament is exercised.It is difficult to see what action could profitably be taken on thisrecommendation...&apos; It is doubtless true that the expressions &quot;regulation,&quot; &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;order&quot;should not be used indiscriminately and that past statutes have, on occasion, usedlittle discrimination in this respect. It is quite another matter to define accuratelythe categories of instruments to which these terms are respectively appropriate.On this point, the relevant passage in the Select Committee&apos;s Report runs asfollows:  .&quot;23.   Very rightly, in paragraph 15, page 64, of their Report the(Donoughmore) Committee recommended:  &quot;The expressions &apos; regulation,&apos;&apos; rule &apos; and &apos; order &apos; should not be usedindiscriminately in statutes to describe the instruments by which the law-making power conferred on Ministers by Parliament is exercised. Theexpression &apos; Regulation&apos; should be used to describe the instrument bywhich the power to make law about procedure is exercised. The expres-sion &apos; order &apos; should be used to describe the instrument of the exerciseof&apos;(a) executive power, and (b) the power to take judicial and quasi-judicial decisions.&quot;Your Committee agreed with and endorse these recommendations.&quot;As quoted, this passage from the Donoughmore Committee&apos;s Report implies that any delegated legislation must necessarily be either a law about procedureor an exercise of executive power or of a power to take judicial and quasi-judicialdecisions, but plainly a very large proportion of the delegated legislation of to-daydoes not fall into these categories. The fact is that the Donoughmore Committee&apos;recommendation is not correctly quoted by the Select Committee as the second sentence of the recommendation ran as follows: &quot; The expression &apos; regulation &apos;should be used to describe the instrument by which the power to make substantiveiaw is exercised and the expression &apos; rule&apos; to describe the instrument by whichthe power to make law about procedure is exercised,&quot; and the words underlinedhave been omitted in the Select Committee&apos;s quotation. This omission entirelyalters the sense, the natural meaning of the Donoughmore Committee&apos;s recom-mendatiOn, read by itself, being that all delegated legislation should be described as regulations except instruments about procedure which should be described as rules,&quot; order &quot; being reserved for instruments which, being either executive or judicialor quasi-judicial, are not really legislative at all.But the matter does not end there, for the Donoughmore Committee added the following footnote: - .:&quot; We realise the natural disinclination to change.so hallowed a name as&apos; Order in Council&apos;: and we recognise the propriety and desirability of keeping it for prerogative Orders in Council which are original arid &apos;notdelegated legislation, but we suggest that statutory orders in Council should* be &quot;known henceforth as &apos; Regulations-iri Council.&apos;-    :
&quot; There is one exception of principle which we favour for reasons of convenience. When a Minister under statutory powers &apos; appoints &apos; a day foran Act to come into force, he does what is in theory a legislative act; but theword &apos; regulation&apos; is inappropriate and we recognise that to retain the word&apos; order &apos; is in accordance with common sense. So when a Minister &apos; confirms &apos;a scheme he may appropriately be spoken of as making an order. But the distinction we seek to draw is obvious and we need not enlarge further. Thereare also various cases where the Act of a Minister is mainly executive, or mainly judicial, although in analysis it has a legislative aspect. Here again the word &apos; order &apos; is appropriate.&quot;This footnote, which obviously represents some second thoughts, brings outthe difficulties of a hard-and-fast rule very clearly. In the first part of the footnotethe Committee recognise (a) that the continued use of the phrase &quot;Order inCouncil&quot; is inconsistent with their general thesis, and (b) that any proposal toabandon it would be generally unwelcome. In the second part of the footnote,they recognise three classes of case, the last of which is indicated rather thandefined, where &quot; order &quot; is more appropriate than &quot; regulation &quot; even though the resulting instrument has to be recognised as being in part at any rate an exerciseof legislative power. The recommendation and the footnote, read together,amount in fact to little more than a recommendation that common sense should beused in deciding whether &quot; regulation &quot; or &quot; order &quot; is the more appropriate term.Current practice in drafting statutes does, it is thought, have regard to thefact that &quot; order &quot; in some cases is a more natural term to use than &quot; regulation &quot;and vice versa, and draws the line more or less in accordance with the suggestions in the Donoughmore Report. It is not pretended that uniformity is attained, butit is submitted that after all this does no great harm. To obtain a really firmdistinction between orders and regulations, even if it were possible to do so, wouldinvolve not only precise definitions of the respective categories for use in futurestatutes but also wholesale amendment of the existing statute book a task in-volving an expense of Parliamentary time and ministerial and official labour whollyout of proportion to any practical advantage which might be expected to result.
