1^printed for the Cabinet.   March 1954SECRET Copy No.   6 1- cabinet office- (54) 85 record copy3rd March, 1954CABINETDEPORTATION  OF  BRITISH  SUBJECTS:   POWERS   OF   COLONIALGOVERNMENTSNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in accordance with C.C. (54) 7th Conclusions, Minute 4,1 circulate on behalfof the Secretary of State for the Colonies the attached memorandum summarising the present powers of Colonial Governments to deport British subjects. As willbe seen, the position varies widely in different parts of the Colonial Empire inaccordance with local circumstances. In my earlier paper (C. (54) 54) I presented a precis of the relevant legislation in each Commonwealth country. I think thatthe mass of detail required to present a comparable survey of Colonial legislation,territory by territory, would not be helpful for the present purpose, and theattached memorandum attempts to do no more than set out the main features.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,4th March, 1954.45804
Memorandum   :.;POWERS  OF  COLONIAL  GOVERNMENTS  TO  DEPORTBRITISH SUBJECTSPowers of one kind or another to deport British subjects exist in all colonial territories. There is great diversity between the enactments of the 45 colonial territories, which vary widely in local circumstances and constitutional status.In some cases powers are given in laws dealing specifically with the deportation of British subjects, while in others they are included in laws of wider scope, suchas those dealing with the control of immigration, expulsion of undesirables,vagrancy, or similar matters. In some territories deportation provisions are to befound in several different laws, and in certain instances provisions occur in orders in Council as well as in local legislation.2. The general policy has been to encourage Colonial Governments to bring their legislation into line with a Model Ordinance which was drafted by a Depart-mental Committee in 1933. The more important recommendations of thiscommittee were that:  (a) a person who &quot; belongs &quot; to a territory (see paragraph 3 below) shouldnot be liable to deportation outside that territory;(b) a judicial enquiry or judicial proceedings should precede the making ofany deportation order against a British subject.3. The definition of a person who &quot;belongs&quot; to the territory varies some-what, but in a number of territories the term is defined (following the 1933 modelprovisions) as a British subject who (a) was born in the territory or was born ofparents who at the time were ordinarily resident there; or (b) has been ordinarily resident in the territory continuously for a period of seven years or more and hasnot since the end of that period been ordinarily resident continuously for a periodof seven years or more in any other part of the Commonwealth; or (c) wasnaturalised in the territory; or (d) is the wife, or minor child, of a person.falling within the foregoing classes. There is, however, no universal &quot;definition of&quot;belonging.&quot; Some territories employ a narrower definition than that justdescribed; e.g., in Aden it is limited to persons born in the territory, and in theGold Coast to those who are &quot; natives &quot; of the territory.4. A number of Colonial territories, notaibly those in West Africa and the carribbean, have brought their legislation into line with the 1933 model, so thatBritish subjects are only liable to deportation if they do not qualify as &quot; belonging &quot;to the territory (however that term is defined). On the other hand, other territories,notably those in East Africa and in parts of the Far East and Pacific, have con-tinued for special local reasons to retain older provisions giving wider powers.At the present time powers to deport (among others) British subjects who do&quot; belong &quot; exist in Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Nyasaland, Somaliland,the Federation of Malaya, Brunei, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, the BritishSolomon Islands Protectorate, the New Hebrides Condominium, and Gibraltar.5. In 1952 statements of policy were made in reply to parliamentary questions to the effect that the power to deport persons from the Colonial terri-tory to which they &quot; belong &quot; (where that power still existed) would not be usedsave in exceptional circumstances, and that an administrative directive had beenissued to the Governments of the Colonial territories which had that power (except the Federation of Malaya and Gibraltar, where, for special reasons, it would be unwise to restrict the power to order immediate removals) requiring them to seek the authority of the Secretary of State whenever they proposed to exercise it.6. The same Parliamentary statement added that Colonial governments which had not already done so had been asked to provide by legislation that theuse of judicial process should normally be obligatory before a British subject wasdeported from the territory; most Governments have agreed to this.7. The position of British subjects who do not &quot; belong &quot; to a Colonial terri-tory is different, and is usually governed by the immigration laws (which apply
to aliens too). Such legislation in the Colonial territories generally permitsdeportation orders to be made against immigrant British subjects who do not&quot; belong &quot; to the territory and who are either:  (a) convicted persons in respect of whom the court recommends that adeportation order should be made; or(b) undesirable persons; or ,   &apos;(c) destitute persons; orid) persons who are prohibited immigrants.8. An undesirable person is generally defined as a person who is, or has been,conducting himself so as to be dangerous to peace, good order, good government or public morals. A destitute person is generally defined as a person who is, oris likely to be, a charge upon public funds by reason of mental or bodily health or insufficiency of means to support himself and his dependants, if any. Aprohibited immigrant is generally defined as a person who has entered the territorycontrary to the provisions of the local immigration law, that is to say, a person who has entered the territory in an irregular manner, or who falls within specifiedclasses of persons in respect of whom restrictions on immigration have been laiddown. There is some variety in the classes so prescribed in immigration legislation,and it is not felt necessary to specify them all; but it may be of interest to add thatin a number of territories a person can be deemed to be an undesirable immigrantin consequence of information received from a reliable source, whether british or foreign through official or diplomatic channels.9. In practice, powers to restrict immigration are generally invoked in orderto protect indigenous peoples against undesirable Europeans; powers to restrict,for example, the movements of African British subjects between one African colony and another are either not included in immigration legislation or, where they exist,are seldom invoked.Colonial Office,2nd March, 1954.
