(this Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)secret cabinet OFFICE / GRECORD COPY        copy no.Jbi19th february, 1954cabinetAGRICULTURAL REVIEW, 1954Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Axupovxl Review of the agricultural industry, which leads toa determination of price guarantees for the main commodities, is due to begin with farmers&apos; representatives on Thursday, 25th February, and theCommittee of Ministers on Food and Agriculture, under my chairmanship,have considered what instructions should be given to the officials who willconduct the discussions..2.        There is a large measure of agreement between the ministers concerned both as to our general objectives, and as to the details of thesettlement, the level of price guarantees and the likes which we should try to secure.    But there are appreciable differences of view in the case ofcertain commodities, on which a decision by the Cabinet is necessary.Long-term Agricultural Prodtiction and Guarantee policy.        Vfe shall be pressed, during the discussions, for an indication of our future production and guarantee policy.    With the disappearance of controls over marketing and selling prices, producers are understandablyanxious to know what is expected of them and to what extent they can continue to count on Government support to protect the industry from widefluctuations in market conditions, and to provide sufficient stability for continued development.    Thez-e is no question but that the maintenanceof a stable and efficient agricultural industry is in the national interest,,4.        It is  however, also generally agreed that the present cost of assisting the agricultural industry is too high, and that the burden which such assistance is currently placing on the Exchequer must be reduced.Without any price adjustments, the Ministry of Food estimate of the food subsidies for 1954/5 (including certain production grants)is   356 millions,of this about  250 millions represents direct assistance to farmers.Indeed, if we do not limit this burden in some way, the industry willforfeit the sympathy of the public.    This high cost of assistance to agriculture is a measure of the success of our agricultural policy in achieving the primary objective of a large expansion of output (aM?eadyin 1953/4 56 per cent over pre-war production, and getting on towardsthe target of at least 60 per cent above pre-war which we set ourselves in 1952. )    The cost to the Exchequer has inevitably been the higherbecause of falling prices in world markets.    We still aim at this level ofproduction, but we may not be able to afford it unless unit costs ofproduction fall sufficiently.
5.        Our future agricultural policy must therefore express thereconciliation of these two main needs - to give the industry an assurancefor the future;, and to limit the liability of the Exchequer,,    The ministers concerned are at present working on this line;  it involves consideration ofour policy on food imports, of various methods by which the cost of guaranteed prices can be qualified, and of any practicable means of financing part of the necessary assistance to agriculture otherwise thanout of general revenue.    We shall submit our recommendations on futureagricultural production and guarantee policy to the Cabinet,6.        But it is clear that, for the purposes of the impending annual review, we cannot provide any additiona.l protection for the agricultural industry by controlling imports of food, and that, to limit the burden on theExchequer as soon as possible, we must reduce the prices for a number of commodities.The Annual review.        Apart from the need to limit Exchequer liability, which is already a matter of some public concern, there are good grounds for reducing thelevel of guaranteed prices in certain cases this year.     Supplies of some commodities, such as milk and eggs, are now ample to meet demand atpresent prices;  the efficiency of the industry can be expected to continueto increase, and this should enable the industry to reduce its presentdependence on Government support;  and, for the first time., there was a 6 millions net decrease in farmers&apos; costs last year, a trend which isexpected to continue,Q,        In the past, in deciding the level of guaranteed prices for the commodities covered by the Review, both the Government and the industry have taken as their main guide the total of producers&apos; net incomes, andhave calculated a global award adjusting farmers&apos; gross receipts in thelight of aggregate net cost changes.    But this year, some major factors(both in farmers&apos; costs, and in their receipts) cannot be accuratelycalculated, in view of the decontrol of feeding-stuffs, and the change fromfixed prices to market prices supplemented by guarantees,    A more realistic way of approaching the problem in these circumstances insteadof fixing a global award and apportioning it between commodities, is todecide the proper price level for the individual commodities, having regardin each case to the Exchequer liability that we can afford and the level ofproduction we need.    We must, then, pay attention to the total effect ofthese decisions on the remuneration of the industry, so far as we can judge it,9.        The recommendations of Ministers on the individual commodities are set out briefly in the following paragraphs, and a summary showingthe effect of these recommendations on farmers&apos; incomes and on Exchequerliability is given in the Appendix,Fat cattle and fat sheep10,      We are agreed that prices should be left unchanged in order to achieve the desired level of production.Pigs11.      The price has been gradually reduced since the last Review throughthe operation of a sliding scale based on the price of feeding-stuff sa    Butthis does not affect profits and we are agreed that a further substantialprice reduction is necessary, since the profits on pig-keeping are high.
and the subsidy ( 48 millions) is heavy.    We need greater efficiency and higher quality.    We are agreed that we should reduce the price by a further4s. 3d.   per score, and that it should continue to be geared to the price of feeding-stuffs.Wool12.      We are agreed that a substantial reduction in the price of woolshould be made, which would have the effect of reducing producers1 returnsby  2/3 millions; this does not affect the Exchequer this year,,Milk13.      Milk production is increasing beyond our needs, and the disposalof the surplus is becoming a difficult problem.    We all agree that we mustcheck this increase, and that a reduction in herds is necessary.    the agriculture Ministers feel that it would be unwise to reduce the price bymore than Id, a gallon,,    The Minister of Food thinks that some larger increase is necessary, but agrees that a reduction of 2dQ a gallon mightbe too severe.   This question, however, is bound up with the level of the retail price of milk.    The Minister of Food is most anxious to avoid anincrease in the retail price, in case consumption declined still further and the quantity of surplus milk became unmanageable,    I feel myselfthat a reduction of 2d. in the price to producers might be dangerous, butif their price is reduced by only Id, per gallon, we must give considerationto a gradual easing of the burden of this subsidy on the Exchequer by increasing the retail price,14.      We all agree that the present estimated level of the Exchequerliability for eggs ( 35 millions) is far too high.    It is true that there arespecial causes for it, but this only supports the view of those who considereggs are unsuitable for inclusion in the list of those commodities for whichguaranteed prices are given under the Agriculture Act.15.      The Agriculture Ministers and the Minister of Food think thatthe support price of eggs could be linked to a feeding-stuffs price formula(as in the case of pigs).    The Agriculture Ministers think it is essentialto do no more this year than link the present support price of 4/- tofeeding-stuffs prices; this would be likely to reduce the actual supportprice to 3/9d, and they think that the combined effect of this and the fallin market prices would be to reduce farmers&apos; receipts by some 14 millions below the current year&apos;s.    The Minister of Food recommendsreducing the support price to 3s. 6d.    For the future, Ministers are considering methods of qualifying the Exchequer liability by relating thesupport price to a limited volume of production or to rates of deficiency round.    My view is that we must make a very substantial reduction inthe Exchequer liability for this commodity, and that we must reduce thesupport price to 3s. 6d., and, as soon as practicable, further limit thesubsidy in one of the ways suggested above.Cereals16.      The cost of the cereals subsidy has been rising fast, and we allagree that some reduction in the standard prices (which will not apply until1955) is necessary.    The Agriculture Ministers are prepared to make a straight reduction in the standard price of all cereals of Is, Od. a cwt.The Minister of Food thinks that the reduction should be one of 2s. Od. s
and that in addition a sliding scale should be introduced so that theExchequer would meet the deficiency in full only up to a certain amount,and beyond that point growers would carry an increasing share of the costof the deficiency themselves subject to a final limitation on their share; if a.sliding scale limitation of this sort is not introduced, the Minister of Foodrecommends a reduction of 4s. Od. a cwt, in the standard prices of allcereals.    From the point of view of the Treasury I think that the reduction should be one of at least 2s. Od. a cwt. all round, and I would like toconsider the possibility of further limiting the Exchequer liability by asliding scale arrangement.    The Agriculture Ministers are, however,opposed to a sliding scale on the basis proposed.17.      There may be a case for seeking a larger reduction in the price for wheat than for other cereals, and the Minister of Agriculture is considering whether he can recommend this.Potatoes18.      The Agriculture Ministers recommend an average support priceof  11 per ton (for 1955), this price to be varied according to the regions.The Minister of Food and I think that a support price, with regionalvariation, of  10. 10s. a ton should be sufficient to secure the level ofproduction we need.Sugar beet19.      The Minister of Food and I propose to reduce the price to producers (for 1955) by 3s. 4d. a ton (which is the amount by which theprice was increased for the 1954 harvest).    The Minister of Agriculturesees no reason to alter the price either way.    It is true that there has beena relatively high increase in the cost of production of sugar beet, but at thesame time there is little doubt that we should get a sufficient acreage evenif the reduction were made.Fertilisers20.      I would like to reduce the subsidy on fertilisers in such a way thatthe Exchequer and farmers benefit in equal proportions from the fall infertiliser prices which has occurred.   The Agriculture Ministers are anxious to maintain the fertiliser subsidy at its present level because ofits general value to the industry.Effect on producers1 incomes and on Exchequer liability21.      The sum of the price reductions suggested by the agriculture ministers would entail a reduction in producers&apos; gross receipts of about 38 millions; the sum of those suggested by the Minister of Food, areduction of  78 millions.    (It will be noted that I see difficulty in going asfar as the Minister of Food on milk).    The corresponding reductions inthe liability of the Exchequer would be  33B5 millions and  69* 5respectively.    As regards the net income of farmers, (total net income isat present about  320 millions for about 350,000 farmers) there may beoffsets amounting to between  20 and  30 millions.
Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.,18TH FEBRUARY, 1954.22.      The difference between Ministers on the level of prices for the commodities on which they are not agreed are matters of degree.    Wehave to decide at what point we should balance the need to reduce theburden on the Exchequer with the need to avoid harm to the confidence and stability of the industry,.    There is no doubt that, in the new economicconditions, and in view of the present cost of the subsidies, a fairlydrastic change of approach is necessary.    We have to convince the farming industry that we mean to continue to support it, but that at the same timethe industry must make some readjustments, not only in the pattern ofproduction, but also to make itself more efficient and competitive.    Thepolitical-, and economic, consequences of failing to keep the confidence of the industry would be serious.    It would be equally serious if we failed to make the industry aware of the need for a new approach.Without it the cost of British agriculture will be such as no Governmentcould bear in the national interest, and the provisions of the Agx*icultureAct, and the assurances they contain, will be called into question.23.      We therefore seek the guidance of our colleagues on the levelof prices we should set for milk, eggs, cereals, potatoes, sugar beet and fertilisers.    Whatever our decisions we must put the Governments viewsfirmly to the farmers&apos; representatives, and be prepared to maintain thoseviews and impose the reductions we think necessary, despite the pressure to alter them which we must expect from the industry and from some ofour own supporters.R.A9B.
