Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1954SECRETIT OFFICED copy copy No. 6 2C. (54) 9711th March, 1954CABINETPROPOSED INQUIRY INTO THE LEEDS CITY POLICEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs seek the approval of my colleagues to a proposal to appoint, a tribunal underthe Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 to inquire into the administrationof the Leeds City police, with particular reference to the disciplinary control ofthe force and the enforcement by the city police of the law relating to off-the-course betting. Under the 1921 Act both Houses must approve the setting upof a tribunal to inquire into &quot; a definite matter of public importance.&quot;2. The Chief Constable of Leeds stated in his evidence to the Royal Corn-mission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming in 1950 that to license ready moneybetting offices would be to regularise what was already a fact in Leeds; bettingoffices had been running in the city for many years, and during the two precedingyears there had been some 120 to 130 prosecutions each year of the occupiers.3. Certain police officers in Leeds were last year charged with disciplinaryoffences for accepting money improperly from commission agents engaged in cashbetting at offices in the city, and for improperly disclosing to commission agentsinformation about impending police raids on their premises. The Watch Com-mittee (which is the disciplinary authority) heard these charges, and as a resultone officer was dismissed, two were required to resign as an alternative to dis-missal, two were reduced in rank from sergeant to constable, and one was punishedby reduction in pay. Appeals were made to me under the Police (Appeals) Acts,1927 and 1943 by the two sergeants who had been reduced in rank. After appoint-ing Mr. Diplock, Q.C., and one of Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabulary tore-hear these two cases and examine the witnesses, I have decided to increase thepunishments by requiring the two appellants to resign from the force.4. Mr. Diplock has reported to me privately certain impressions he receivedwhen holding the appeals inquiry. It appears that the practice in Leeds for manyyears has been to raid each cash betting office once a year and once a year only,the business being carried on openly at other times. The annual raid on any oneoffice is preceded by visits of plain-clothes officers, after which a search warrantis applied for. The occupier is named in the search warrant, and there appearslittle doubt that in some cases there is agreement between the police and theproprietor beforehand as to who is to be named as occupier, so as to limit thenumber of convictions against any one person. The police officers concernedbecome accustomed to swearing informations recklessly, if not indeed falsely, andwitnesses spoke of it being a &quot;tradition&quot; for a plain-clothes officer to have agratuity after the annual appearance of the defendant in court. There can clearly be no certainty that such practices will remain confined to one branch of lawenforcement. Mr. Diplock was unfavourably impressed with the credibility of anumber of police officers in the plain-clothes branch of the force who were calledby the appellants, and thought that the methods adopted to enforce the law onready money betting appeared to have led to evils which indirectly affected a wider area of criminal law and the administration of justice.45832
5. In my view the Watch Committee imposed unduly lenient penalties on certain of the defaulters brought before them last year (although I could interfereonly in the two cases where the defaulter appealed) and the record of the forceover the past three years shows more disciplinary offences than in any other forceof comparable size. I think there are strong grounds for looking into the dischargeby the Watch Committee of its disciplinary functions.6. Information about irregularities in the City police force has become known and has caused much public disquiet. I felt it premature to propose any public inquiry so long as there were appeals outstanding, but now that I have decidedthe appeals I should like to proceed with the proposal to set up a tribunal of inquiryunder the 1921 Act, consisting of a person with legal qualifications, assisted byone of Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabulary.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W. 1,10th March, 1954.
