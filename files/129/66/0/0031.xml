(INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCEThere are set out below the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on threeConventions and three Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference at its 35th Session in 1952 which it is proposed to communicate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office. The Englishtexts of these Conventions and Recommendations were presented to parliament in Cmd. 8825.Convention (No. 101) concerning Holidays with Pay in AgricultureThis Convention provides that workers employed in agricultural under-takings and related occupations shall be granted an annual holiday with payafter a period of continuous service with the same employer. The manner inwhich effect is given to this provision is left for national decision but theConvention states that such provision may be made by means of collective agreements or by entrusting the regulation of holidays with pay to specialbodies. The undertakings or occupations to which the Convention is appliedare also left for national determination. The required minimum period of continous service and the minimum duration of the holiday are to be deter-mined by, and the holiday remuneration is to be either not less than the worker&apos;susual remuneration or calculated as prescribed by national laws or regulations,collective agreements, arbitration awards, or by special bodies entrusted withthe determination of holidays with pay in agriculture or in any other mannerapproved by the competent authority. The Convention also includes provisionfor such matters as: special treatment for young workers; longer holidayson the basis of length of service; proportionate holidays in cases where the continuous service is not long enough to qualify the worker for the annual holiday; the exclusion of public and customary holidays, weekly rest andcertain temporary absences from the annual holiday; the division of the holiday; and payment of the remuneration due for holidays not taken in casesof dismissal. It is laid down that agreements to relinquish the right to anannual paid holiday shall be void. An adequate system of inspection and supervision to ensure the application of the provisions of the Convention isto be maintained.The existing law in Great Britain relating to the grant of holidays with pay in agriculture is contained in the Agricultural Wages Act, 1948, and theAgricultural Wages (Scotland) Act, 1949. Under these Acts the agricultural wages Boards are empowered to make Orders, having the force of law, fixingholidays with pay for agricultural workers. The exercise of these powers isnot obligatory, however, and lies within the discretion of the Boards.1Although the Boards have in fact, made Orders providing for holidays with pay, acceptance by the Government of the central obligation of the convention to ensure that workers in agricultural undertakings and related occupationsare granted an annual holiday with pay after a period of continuous employ-ment with the same employer would not be consistent with the discretionarypowers vested in the Boards under the terms of the existing law. For thisreason Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to ratify the Convention.Recommendation (No. 93) concerning Holidays with Pay in agriculture the Recommendation contains a number of provisions which are supple-mentary to those contained in Convention No. 101. It is provided that theminimum length of the holiday with pay should be one working week for aperiod of one year&apos;s continuous service, with proportionate holidays for a1 In Northern Ireland the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act (Northern Ireland) 1939specifically provides for an annual holiday with pay of six days for agricultural workers.23100A2
lesser period of continuous service; that there should be specially favourableprovisions for workers under eighteen years of age including a minimumholiday of two weeks for workers under sixteen years of age; that continuity of service required to qualify for a holiday with pay should not be affected bytemporary interruptions due to sickness or accident, family events or other similar circumstances; that, beginning as soon as possible, the length of the holiday should increase with the duration of the service to a prescribed minimumafter a prescribed number of years; that the worker should have the right totake at least one part of his holiday in an uninterrupted period which shouldnot be less than a prescribed minimum; and that holidays with pay shouldnot interfere with peak work periods or seriously prejudice agricultural production.All the matters dealt with in this Recommendation are, in Great Britain,within the discretion of the Agricultural Wages Boards2The difficulty which precludes the ratification of the Convention (No. 101)also operates against the acceptance^ of the Recommendation. Moreover,existing law and practice d&amp;mot in conformity with a number of the provisionsof the Recommendation. In these circumstances Her Majesty&apos;s government do not propose to accept it.Convention (No. 102) concerning Minimum Standards of Social SecurityThis Convention is a comprehensive instrument covering practically thewhole of the social security field. It lays down certain general requirements and deals individually with each of the following nine branches of social security: (a) Medical Care (Part II of the Convention).(b) Sickness Benefit (Part III of the Convention).(c) Unemployment Benefit (Part IV of the Convention).(d) Old Age Benefit (Part V of the Convention).(e) Employment Injury Benefit (Part VI of the Convention).(f) Family Benefit (Part VII of the Convention).(g) Maternity Benefit (Part VIII of the Convention).(h) Invalidity Benefit (Part IX of the Convention).(/) Survivors&apos; Benefit (Part X of the Convention).States Members ratifying the Convention must comply with at least three ofthe Parts dealing with the individual branches of social security, including atleast one of Parts IV, V, VI, IX and X. In their ratification they are requiredto specify in respect of which of these Parts they accept the obligations ofthe Convention. They must also comply with the general requirements ofthe Convention.For each branch of social security the Convention lays down minimum standards as to the proportion of workpeople or of the population who mustbe protected. Appropriate conditions for the receipt of social security benefits and the duration of benefit are also specified. The provisions of the Conventionmay be complied with by schemes of the social insurance type or alternatively,in the case of certain of the contingencies, by schemes of the social assistancetype which involve a means test.The Convention also lays down requirements as to the minimum rates of social security benefits. These rates must be sufficient to provide a specifiedsum for a &quot; standard beneficiary&quot; defined by the Convention (for mostcontingencies the standard beneficiary is a man with a wife and two dependent2 The position is broadly the same in Northern Ireland. See, however, footnote (&apos;) inregard to the length of the annual holiday with pay in Northern Ireland.
children). The sum is calculated, in the case of a scheme of the same typeas the United Kingdom National Insurance scheme, by reference to the averagewage-rate of a typical unskilled adult male worker (identified in accordancewith criteria set out in the Convention) in the country concerned. For eachcontingency a percentage (ranging from 40 to 50 per cent, for most of thecontingencies) is prescribed, and the benefit must be at least equal to thatpercentage of the wage-rate, account being taken of any family allowance paid.In the case of a social assistance scheme provision must be made for a regularscale of assistance such that it, together with any resources which are takeninto account, will be sufficient to maintain the family in health and decencyand not be less than the figures calculated as described above.Other Parts of the Convention deal with such matters as equality of treatment for non-national residents, disqualifications and appeals against them and the incidence of contributions for the benefits for which the Convention makes provision.The law and practice of the United Kingdom are in conformity with all thegeneral requirements of the Convention. They are also in accordance withthe provisions of the Parts relating to the following six branches of social security, as compared with the minimum of three required for ratification:-Medical Care (Part II).Sickness Benefit (Part III).Unemployment Benefit (Part IV).Old Age Benefit (Part V).Family Benefit (Part VII).Survivors&apos; Benefit (Part X).The law and practice are not fully in accordance with the following Parts ofthe Convention for the reasons given: Part VI (Employment Injury Benefit) provides for cash benefits and,in the case of a morbid condition, for medical care. The provisionsregarding cash benefit are satisfied by United Kingdom National Insurancelaw relating to Industrial Injuries. The medical care required is providedby the national health services. The Convention, however, makes no provision whereby the beneficiary can be required to share the cost ofthe medical care whereas a measure of cost-sharing is in operation in theUnited Kingdom.Part VIII (Maternity Benefit) prescribes minimum rates, of benefit which are in excess of those payable under the National Insurance Actsand also appear to be disproportionate to those prescribed elsewhere inthe Convention for other contingencies.Part IX (Invalidity Benefit) presents difficulties in relation to the UnitedKingdom social security system in that it appears to envisage a schemewhich provides for sickness benefit for a limited period followed bydisability pension where there is a permanent loss of capacity to an extentprescribed by legislation. Under the National Insurance Acts there isno such separate disability pension; a claimant who has paid the requisitecontributions and remains incapable of work may continue to draw sickness benefit weekly until it is replaced by a retirement pension. national assistance is also payable at need where the person is incapable of re-remunerative full-time work.In the circumstances described Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose to ratify the Convention and in accordance with Article 2 to specify in the ratificationtheir acceptance of the obligations of Part II (Medical Care), III (sickness benefit), IV (Unemployment Benefit), V (Old Age Benefit), VII (FamilyBenefit) and X (Survivors&apos; Benefit).
Convention (No. 103) concerning Maternity protection the Convention revises an earlier Convention (No. 3) of 1919 on the same subject. It lays down that women employed in industrial undertakings and in non--industrial and agricultural occupations, including women wage earnersworking at home,-shall be entitled to a period of maternity leave of at leasttwelve weeks duration of which a period of at least six weeks after confinementis to be compulsory. The distribution of the remaining leave as between the periods before confinement and after the compulsory leave can be varied. Itis not to be lawful for an employer to give a woman notice of dismissal duringthe period of maternity leave or to give her notice which would expire during that period. The Convention also stipulates the payment of cash benefits andthe provision of medical benefits during the period of maternity leave, and the standards which these benefits should attain. It is provided that nursing mothers shall be entitled to interrupt their work for the purpose of nursingtheir children at a time or times to be prescribed by national laws or regulations.Under the social security schemes in operation in the United Kingdom thebenefits available are considered to be fully adequate to enable women to refrain from working during the periods envisaged in the Convention. Theydiffer, however, in some respects from those prescribed by the Convention.Moreover, as regards those provisions of the Convention which would requirethe adoption of special legislative prohibitions and restrictions on the employ-ment or dismissal of women workers before or after childbirth, the UnitedKingdom has relied successfully on a more elastic combination of legal obligations and the practice in trade and industry for the protection of womenemployees generally, coupled with advanced social security services and highlyorganised arrangements for giving health education and medical advice to women in connection with maternity. The law and practice of the UnitedKingdom are not therefore in conformity with the provisions of the convention and Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to ratify it.Recommendation (No. 95) concerning Maternity protection the Recommendation is supplementary to the Convention. It coversbroadly the same ground as the Convention, and embodies a number of provisions going beyond the standards there laid down.Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to accept the Recommendation.Recommendation (No. 94) concerning Consultation and Co-operation between employers and Workers at the Level of the undertaking the Recommendation provides that appropriate steps should be taken topromote consultation and co-operation between employers and workers at thelevel of the undertaking on matters of mutual concern not within the scope of collective bargaining machinery or not normally dealt with by other machineryconcerned with the determination of terms and conditions of employment. it also provides that, in accordance with national custom or practice, such consulta-tion and co-operation should be facilitated by the encouragement of voluntary agreement between the parties; promoted by laws or regulations which would, establish the bodies for consultation and co-operation and determine their scope, structure and methods of operation; or facilitated or promoted by a combination of these two methods.   &apos;It is^established policy of the Government to promote consultation andco-operation between employers and workers at the level of the undertaking,and for this purpose to encourage the conclusion of voluntary agreements between the parties. The alternative methods mentioned are not in accordancewith custom or practice in the United Kingdom. Her Majesty&apos;s government accept the Recommendation on this basis.(23100)  Wt. 1511-1876  13, 30, 50  2/54  D.L. printed in orbat Britain
