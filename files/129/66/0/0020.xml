SECRET CABINET OFFICE Copy No.C. (54) 70 RECORD COPY22nd February, 1954CABINETEAST-WEST TIRADE:  SHIPPINGMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theFirst Lord of the admiralty on 17th February the Cabinet agreed that we should seek to obtain american agreement to a shorter list of strategic items which should be embargoed to theSoviet bloc, and to the abolition of the present list of items subject to quantitativecontrol (C.C. (54) 9th Conclusions, Minute 6).2. With regard to merchant ships, we are agreed that ships with a trial speedin excess of 15 knots should be subject to the full embargo if agreement on thisspeed can be reached in Paris. We have considered what course of action torecommend with regard to the ships which would not be subject to embargo. Fromthe purely strategic point of view the Naval Staff would favour the continuation of quantitative controls and the Admiralty would view their abolition with mis-giving. Nevertheless we both recognise that an exception for ships would almost certainly open the door to similar controls on other items and would thus be inconsistent with the policy already approved by the Cabinet. We consider,therefore, that the right course is to make our initial approach to the Americans onthe basis of the complete abolition of quantitative control over ships not subject tothe full embargo. We recognise that if, in the course of our discussions with the americans, we have to give way on the question of quantitative control, merchant ships would need to be included in any quantitative control list.3. The discussions with the Americans on our short list proposals may takea considerable time. Meanwhile, we are ourselves risking the loss of valuableRussian orders. We are also committed to discussions in the Paris Group oncontrols over ships on the basis of the existing criteria, and indeed we are alreadydiscussing in Paris controls over trawlers in accordance with these criteria. the approach which we propose on the basis of the existing criteria is set out in theFirst Lord&apos;s memorandum (Annex A) and we recommend that we continue withthis submission to the Paris Group. Until we have concluded our discussions withthe Americans on our short list proposals, we should continue to operate ourcontrols on the basis of whatever is agreed in the Paris Group.P. T.J. P.

2\&apos;ANNEX A     -East-West Trade:   ShippingMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty in G. (53) 313 the Cabinet were informed that, at the suggestion of the UnitedStates, talks were to be heid between United States and United Kingdom officials on the supply of shipping to the Soviet Woe. The United Kingdom officials con-sisted of representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Foreign Office, Board ofTrade, Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and the Admiralty, who also provided the Chairman.2. The discussions took the form of a comprehensive review of the existingcontrols of the export of shipping to the Soviet bloc operated by the Paris Groupcountries. The Chairman&apos;s report is at Annex B. The main points which aroseare described in the following paragraphs.Fishing vessels3, It was agreed that while some restriction on the supply of trawlers to theSoviet bloc was strategically desirable the appropriate method of control would beby a quota system. The quota agreed was about 40 vessels a year roughlysufficient to enable the Soviet bloc to maintain its fishing fleet at about its present strength, leaving any increase in the size of the fleet to be provided from the blocksown resources. It was also agreed that fishing vessels of non-magnetic construe-tion or vessels of abnormal size, range and speed should not be supplied.Ministerial approval was obtained to these joint United States /United Kingdomproposals and discussions On them, are proceeding in the Paris Group.Merchant ships4, United States and United Kingdom officials agreed not to export to theSoviet bloc particular types of merchant ships having high strategic value orreadily convertible to military use. These comprise tankers, whale factory ships,large ice-breakers (all of which are on the existing embargo list) together with-ships of mOre than 15 knots speed (trial conditions) -potential commercial,  raiders;    :large passenger ships potential troop ships;small coasters because they are virtually immune against influence mines.Ministers have already agreed (C.C. (54) 9th Conclusions, Minute 6) that the shortlist should include as many of these types as can be agreed with other countries ofthe Paris Group.5. It was also agreed that any merchant ships supplied to the Soviet blocshould not be equipped with features such as bow or stern unloading arrangements,facilities for launching or landing aircraft and should not have abnormally power-ful derricks or other type of lifting equipment.6. The present arrangements for the control Of supply of merchant shipsOutside the embargo categories are that ships over 12 knots service speed (131 knotstrial speed) or over 7,000 gross tons shall not be exported Without prior consultationwith the Paris Group. The United Kingdom has, however, been applyingunilaterally for some years a complete embargo on ships Over 12 knots. Theoperation of these rules has acted as a strong discouragement to exports. As theBritish shipyards will shortly be needing work, and as the Soviet Government is inthe market for merchant ships, United Kingdom officials were of the opinion that,provided merchant ships of high strategic value were denied, the rules regarding theexport of other types should be relaxed consistently with, strategic considerations.As, however, all shipping has a strategic value some limitations ort the supply of ordinary shipping are necessary. The Chiefs of Staff have endorsed this principle.) 7. In the course of the discussions United Kingdom officials therefore took thelme thatthe Soviet bloc should be allowed to acquire ordinary merchant shipping to replace, over a period of ten years that &quot;part of the Soviet merchant fleet which isalready more than 30 years old and to allow for the gradual replacement of the ships
which are under that age. This is calculated at about 150,000 gross tons of shippinga year, and is much in excess of the rate of ordering by the U.S.S.R. in recent years.The figure is acceptable to the Naval Staff who would, in fact, be prepared eitherto allow the tonnage of second-hand ships over 15 years old sold to the bloc to becharged only as to half against this quota or, alternatively, to accept an increase inthe quota up to 200,000 gross tons per annum, which they regard as the absolutemaximum.8. United States officials, after protracted consultation with Washington, werenot prepared to agree to a figure of more than 68,000 gross tons per annum. (indeed in the course of the discussions it was evident that Washington attaches considerablestrategic importance to ordinary shipping, particularly in relation to the Far East.)In the absence of agreement on this point it was decided that, in putting forwardjoint United States/United Kingdom revised proposals for shipping controls to the paris Group, no mention should be made of any specific quota of ordinary merchant ships, but that both the United Kingdom and United States should be free to develop their own views on the size of the quota during the Paris discussions.9. The proposal (which the United States have agreed) to allow ships up to15 knots (trial speed) to be exported to the Soviet bloc represents an increase of aboutli knots in the speeds permissible under current controls, but it is possible that the paris Group countries may ask for an even higher speed. The Naval Staff considerthat 15 knots is the maximum which is strategically acceptable, but, a unilateralUnited Kingdom embargo at this speed, while other countries accepted orders forfaster ships, would serve no purpose. We shall therefore press hard with the americans for the limit suggested, but may have to agree a slightly higher speed.10. The Soviet Government is making enquiries for a wide range of ships inthis country and in Western Europe and some United Kingdom firms may wish totake orders before agreed conclusions emerge from Paris. Approval is accordinglysought to accept orders for ordinary merchant ships within a total of 30,000 grosstons for delivery in any year as an interim measure.11. It is unfortunate that in these joint talks with United States officials full agreement has not been possible, but I am in complete accord with the line taken by united Kingdom officials. In my view 150,000 gross tons of shipping a year is areasonable amount to allow the Soviet Government to acquire from western countries, both from the strategic and commercial point of view. I would not, how-ever, advocate going above this figure for the reason that the U.S.S.R. is devotingthe bulk of its shipbuilding capacity to warship construction and there must in my view be a limit to the amount of merchant shipping they can acquire from the West.12.   I therefore invite my colleagues (a) to take note of the proposals regarding fishing vessels which have been sub-mitted to the Co-ordinating Committee of the Paris Group;(b) to authorise the United Kingdom representative on the Paris Group torecommend a global quota of about .150,000 gross tons to 200,000 grosstons of shipping of non-embargoed types (see paragraph 7); and(c) to authorise, pending the outcome of the Paris discussions, the acceptanceof orders for shipping from United Kingdom sources up to a totalof 30,OOQ gross tons in any one year.J. P. L. T.Admiralty, S.W. 1.19th February, 1954.ANNEX B .East/West Trade;- Shipping .Report by the Chairman on the United States! United Kingdom Shipping talks in C. (53) 313 the President of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of theAdmiralty explained that, at the suggestion of the United States, officials of theUnited States and the United Kingdom were to discuss the general question of45735 b 2
controls on the supply of ships and shipping services to the Soviet bloc; and that,as an early decision was required on Soviet and Polish orders for fishing vesselsfrom the United Kingdom, fishing vessels would be dealt with first. On10th November the Cabinet decided (C.C. (53) 65th Conclusions, Minute 4) that if by .18th November the United States had adduced no new arguments against theexport;of fishing vessels to the Soviet bloc, the Admiralty would be free to licensethe,building of up to 30 fishing vessels for Russia and the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation could authorise the owners concerned to proceed with the saleof 5 second-hand trawlers to Poland., In the event the United States team agreed on 16th November that these transactions should proceed and the necessarydepartmental action was taken. .Fishing Vessels2. The first exchange between the teams of United States and UnitedKingdom officials, which took place on 9th November, disclosed a divergence ofopinion on the potential military usefulness of fishing vessels to the Soviet bloc.The British Naval Staff view, which has the endorsement of the Chiefs of Staff, isthat while trawlers are readily convertible to auxiliary naval craft, their value intheir traditional wartime roles as minesweepers, minelayers and anti-submarinevessels is strictly, and increasingly, limited by developments of modern weapons;and that Russia already. possesses sufficient purpose-built small naval craft tomeet most of her wartime needs. The United States, Naval Staff, although con-ceding that converted trawlers fall short of being ideal small warships, yet consider them to be useful general purpose naval craft and contend that possession of largenumbers of fishing vessels would significantly strengthen the Russian fleet in war.There was also a difference of opinion, which will be mentioned below in the context of merchant shipping controls, on the extent to which the criteria adoptedby the Paris Group justified the withholding of equipment for which the bloc hasa genuine peacetime need. The United Kingdom policy has been to control only those items which contribute more or less directly to the blocs capacity for wagingwar; the United States tend to regard trade controls as a means of impeding the build-up of the Soviet economy more generally.3. There was, however, agreement between the two sides that some types of fishing vessels have a greater potential military value than others and that unlimitedaquisition of any types of fishing vessels by the Soviet bloc would be strategicallydangerous. Accordingly it was found possible to reach agreement in practicalterms on joint proposals for controlling the sale of fishing vessels to the soviet bloc These are set out in detail at Appendix A and may be summarised asfollows-      -(a) vessels which are readily convertible to naval use should not be exported to the Soviet bloc;lb) other types of fishing vessels over 50 feet in length should be retained in list II and controlled quantitatively by annual quota. This quotashould for the next 3-4 years be at the total rate of about 40 a year forall Paris countries together. .The rate of 40 a year is regarded as a reasonable replacement rate for the Sovietfishing fleet. Any acquisitions from other sources (e.g., Sweden and Finland)would be regarded as net additions.4. In view of current Russian negotiations with both United Kingdom andGerman firms for the supply of trawlers, it was desirable to table the proposals onfishing vessels without waiting to conclude the talks on other types of ships. Forthis reason the joint proposals relating to fishing vessels were submitted for (and obtained) ministerial approval in the form of agreed minutes to the departmental ministers concerned. An agreed joint United States/United Kingdom memo-randum was then put to the Co-ordinating Committee of the Paris Group and was discussed at a series of meetings-in the week commencing 11th January, 1954.Objections to certain aspects of the proposals haVe been made by some countries and the matter has been adjourned for further discussion at the end of February.Merchant Ships5. The leader of the United States delegation explained at the outset that hisGovernment. were disturbed by shortcomings in the present system of shippingcontrols, which they felt might lead to the virtually unrestricted sale of merchant
ships to the Soviet bloc by Paris Group countries. They regarded Sovietdeficiencies in the field of transport generally, and shipping specifically, as of first-class strategic importance and they aimed at establishing a comprehensive systemof shipping controls which would &quot; inhibit the development of Soviet war potentialin area of marked vulnerability.&quot; It became clear subsequently that the americans were particularly anxious to prevent any strengthening of the Soviet bloc merchantfleets in the Far East, which might contribute significantly to a Soviet attack on theAleutians, Japan, Formosa or South-East Asia.6. It was explained that the United Kingdom side was anxious to evolve asystem of controls which would effectively prevent the Soviet bloc from acquiringships of special value in war and would also prevent any significant increase inthe Soviet bloc merchant fleets; but that, subject to such considerations of military security, Her Majesty&apos;s Government saw no reason in principle why ships shouldnot be supplied to the bloc. It was also made clear that while admitting that shipping resources gave the Soviet bloc increased operational flexibility and were therefore of some strategic importance, the British Naval Staff considered that ifthe bloc acquired no additional tonnage it would still be able to sustain campaignsin Western Europe, the Middle East and South-East Asia. As for the apprehendedattacks on the Aleutians, Japan and Formosa, the British Naval Staff had no evidence that the Soviets were providing the bases and naval support which, apartfrom merchant shipping, were the pre-requisites of such attacks. They were inclined to doubt whether operations of that nature could be seriously contemplated bythe Soviet bloc in the face of certain intervention by the United States Navy. TheUnited Kingdom could not therefore subscribe to any interpretation of the criteriaadopted by the Paris Group which would unreasonably restrict the need of the bloc to satisfy its legitimate peace-time requirements.7. From the outset both sides emphasises their anxiety to reach agreement on all outstanding issues so as to achieve complete unanimity in support of what-ever joint proposals were put to the Paris Group. The United Kingdom sidestressed that, as with the trawlers, agreement reached during the course of the talks on merchant shipping would be subject to endorsement by United kingdom ministers; and that, while any agreed proposals so endorsed would be supportedin Paris, still the United Kingdom delegates to the Paris Group must be free tomodify their attitude in the light of discussions in the Co-ordinating Committee.They would, of course, consult with the United States delegates before departing from any agreed proposal.The Facts8. Including 176,000 gross registered tons (g.r.t.) of Chinese shipping, the bloc possesses some 2-5 million g.r.t. of merchant shipping (disregarding fishing vessels and other vessels of less than 1,000 g.r.t.). Russia with 1-8 million g.r.t.owns by far the largest share. By Western standards the bloc merchant fleet isold and slow. 39 per cent, of Russian tonnage is over 30 years&apos; old and a further17 per cent, is over 20 years&apos; old. Only 9 per cent, is capable of speeds over12 knots. A significant feature of the bloc merchant fleet is their lack of tankers.The Russian and Satellite merchant fleets can muster seagoing tankers totallingonly 175,000 g.r.t. between them.9. Russian shipbuilding capacity has since the war been devoted almost exclusively to naval construction; recently a small part of the capacity has goneover to building merchant ships, but there is as yet no indication of how far thechange will be carried. The Soviet bloc&apos;s main sources of supply of merchantshipping are the bloc countries themselves which are expected to build an averageof about 70,000 g.r.t. of shipping in each of the next five years; Sweden and Finland,whose contribution may be of the order of 30,000 g.r.t. annually; and the paris group countries. As far as can be judged from present information total deliveries from the Paris Group countries during the three years 1954-56 are likely to beof the order of 200,000 g.r.t. of new sea-going merchant ships excluding trawlers.Proposals for Additions to the Embargo List10. Agreement has been reached on the addition to the embargo list (whichat present includes tankers, whale factories and large ice-breakers) of certain other types of merchant ships agreed to be of sufficiently high strategic value to justifyembargo of exports to the Soviet bloc. These additions comprise (i) ships of over45735 B 3
15 knots speed (suitable as commerce raiders), (ii) large passenger ships (which canbe readily used as troop carriers) and (iii) small coasters (which are practicallyimmune from influence mines). The two sides also found it possible to agree on alist of special features, the incorporation of which would make the export of a ship liable to embargo, and on certain measures to control the completion of new ships (e.g., installation of engines in an existing hull). The points on which agree-ment has been reached are listed fully in Appendix B.11. In the course of the discussions the United States also proposed thatexport of the more important types of dredger should also be embargoed and thatthe control on the export of ice-breakers should be tightened. The United Kingdomreserved its position on dredgers, but on ice-breakers it was agreed that, in orderto prevent the evasion of the control, a more precise definition of the term &quot; ice-breaker &quot; should be proposed for inclusion in the joint recommendation.Control of Exports of Other Ships12. On the question of establishment of a quota for merchant ships not considered important enough for embargo, agreement was not possible. TheUnited Kingdom after first arguing for a higher figure were prepared in order toreach agreement to recommend a quota of .150,000 g.r.t. of shipping, whether new or second-hand, as the maximum which could be exported annually from paris group countries. This was based on (a) the replacement over a period of ten yearsof that part of the Soviet bloc&apos;s merchant fleet which is already more than 30 years&apos;old and (b) the gradual replacement of the remainder of the Soviet merchant fleeton the assumption that a merchant vessel has a useful economic life, by Sovietstandards, of 30 years (in the West, where economic standards are higher, a merchant ship would normally be replaced at an average age of 25 years). TheUnited States would not go beyond a figure of 68,000 g.r.t. The difference was really due to a fundamental difference in the interpretation which the two sidesplaced on the object of the controls, as explained in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.It was also clear that the United States side, although they were anxious to cometo an agreement, felt that association with a recommendation to permit exportsof ships to the Soviet bloc up to a figure of 130,000 g.r.t. per annum would lay theUnited States Administration open to political criticism.13. In an endeavour to find a basis for a joint paper to the Paris Group cover-ing the whole field, the United States side then proposed that the two countries should jointly recommend an agreed global quota of 68,000 g.r.t. annually with aprovision that countries desiring to build beyond their national proportion of thisquota should submit individual proposals as they arose, with a reasoned statementof the economic and other justification therefor to the Paris Group for considera-tion. This was considered unacceptable as it was felt that it would commit theUnited Kingdom to accepting the United States figure as a reasonable basis of calculation and arguing in favour of it in Paris. Moreover a quota of 68,000 g.r.t. ayear was considered to be too small to divide equitably between the number of countries concerned.14. In these circumstances it was agreed that the only course is for the jointproposals of the two countries on the export of ships to be limited to those aspectson which positive agreement has been reached, viz., the additions to the embargolist of the more important strategic types. A general recommendation would beadded that the export of other ships should be controlled under International List II.This would leave the actual method of control to be discussed in the Paris Group,but it would be implicit that the system of prior consultation should lapse unlessspecifically agreed in Paris as part of the new arrangement.Merchant Ship Repairs15. The present arrangements agreed by the Paris Group prohibit repairs andalterations being carried out to ships of the Soviet bloc involving incorporation of(a) important strategic items or (b) military features. Exceptions are, however,permitted where adherence to this arrangement would be in conflict with &quot; nationallaw, the requirements of Classification Societies or international treaties,conventions or usages.&quot; The United States pressed for tighter restrictions and, inparticular, argued that repairs in Paris Group countries of Soviet-owned ships of types included in the Embargo List should be kept to the absolute minimum. Therewere strong objections to the United Kingdom, as a maritime power, accepting any
stricter controls than those now in force and the United States agreed not to presstheir proposal. The United States then proposed the adoption of a reporting system for repairs for a trial period. The United Kingdom would not agree to join withthe United States in proposing the adoption of such a reporting system, but agreedthat if the United States made the proposal to the Paris Group as an addition tothe existing controls, the United Kingdom would be prepared to accept it.Chartering of Merchant Shipping16. Under existing arrangements countries have agreed to take such steps asmay be possible to prevent or restrict bare-boat charters of the more importantstrategic types of merchant ship. It was agreed that no alteration of these controlsshould be included in the joint recommendations.Conclusions17. Agreement was reached that the following proposals should be recom-mended to the Paris Group:  I. Fishing Vessels(i) The export to the Soviet bloc of fishing vessels possessing certaincharacteristics and incorporating certain special features making them particularly suitable for use in war should be embargoed((a) of Appendix A).(ii) The export from all Paris Group countries of other fishing vessels should be limited to a total rate of about 40 a year ((b) of appendix A).II. Merchant Ships(i) The export, to the Soviet bloc of certain types of merchant ships whichare inherently of a high strategic value or are readily susceptibleof conversion to military use, or of those which incorporate certain special features making them particularly suitable for use in war should be embargoed (I of Appendix B).(ii) The export of other merchant ships not included under (i) should be restricted (II of Appendix B).(iii) In. all ships being sold to the bloc, the incorporation of featuresmaking them particularly suitable for military use, or the instaila-tion of munitions items or other items of military use, should be avoided (III of Appendix B).(iv) Completion for the Soviet bloc of partially built ships should be governed by the same rules as those agreed for the supply of complete ships (IV of Appendix B).(v) The incorporation of prohibited features or items in the course of repairs or alterations to vessels owned by the Soviet bloc shouldbe governed by rules which are broadly the same as those agreed for the completion of partially built ships with certain safeguardsbecause of the obligations of international treaties and usages, &amp;c.(V of Appendix B).(vi) No alteration should be made in the arrangements for controllingbare-boat charters to the bloc (paragraph 16).18.   It was not possible to reach agreement on the following:  I. Dredgers ;.&quot; . -[ -The United States proposal that export to the Soviet bloc of certain types of dredgers should be embargoed (paragraph 11).II. Control of the export of ships other than those agreed for embargo ;The amount of an annual quota to be recommended to the Paris Groupas the limit above which export of ships other than those agreed forembargo should not be permitted (paragraph 13 and para-graph 17II (ii)). &apos; x19. It was also agreed that as soon as Ministers&apos; approval had been given, theproposals on which the United States / United Kingdom agreement had beenreached should be submitted jointly to the Co-ordinating Committee of the paris group. . , &apos; - 1 &apos;
Appendix ASummary of the Joint United States! United Kingdom Proposals for controlling the Export of Fishing Vessels to the Soviet blocIt has been agreed at official level that the following proposals will be sub-mitted jointly to the Co-ordinating Committee of the Paris Group by the UnitedStates and United Kingdom delegates: -(a) fishing vessels having any of the characteristics specified below are readilyconvertible to naval use and should not therefore.be exported to theSoviet bloc:  (i) non-magnetic hulls of 60 feet or more in length below plimsoll ifbuilt in or since 1939; or of 100 feet or more in length belowplimsoll if built before 1939;(ii) any type of hull 200 feet or more in length below plimsoll;(iii) a speed of more than 12-^ knots in deep load condition;(iv) a range of more than 7,000 miles at designed speed;(v) incorporating such potentially military features as deck or hullstrengthening for weapons or special construction to accom-accommodate military equipment; hull design permitting beachlandings; any arrangement for de-magnetising; electrical gene-rating capacity in excess of the normal needs of the vessel; items of equipment of military value e.g., mine-sweeping gear, under-water detection equipment, marine radar.(b) other types of fishing vessels (except fish factory ships) over 50 feet in lengthshould be retained in List II and controlled quantitatively by means ofan agreed annual quota. It is suggested that the total quota for all thecountries of the Paris Group should be forty vessels a year fixed initiallyfor a period of three or four years, subject to the normal annual reviewof List II items. For the purpose of the quota the sale of a second-handfishing vessel more than twenty years old would count as a half of oneunit. [The Soviet fishing fleet comprises about 1,000 powered vessels.The proposed quota envisages its replacement by the Paris Groupcountries over a period of thirty years with a small allowance for marinecasualties based on recent British experience.] (The United kingdom would be prepared if necessary, in order to secure the agreement ofother countries, to raise the total quota to fifty a year but would informthe United States representatives before departing from the jointlyagreed figure of forty.)Appendix BJoint United States /United Kingdom Proposals for Controlling the Export ofMerchant Ships and the supply of Shipping Services to the Soviet blocIt has been agreed at official level that the United States and United kingdom governments will submit to the Paris Group joint proposals for the amendment ofthe existing system of shipping controls as follows:  I. Types of Merchant Vessels to be EmbargoedIt is proposed tp withhold entirely from the Soviet bloc, so far as lies withinthe competence of the Paris Group, all merchant ships which are inherently ofa high strategic value; or are readily susceptible of conversion to military use; orincorporate features which would make them militarily useful; namely:  f (i) tankers and tank barges;jalready     V (ii) whale factory ships;embargoed 1 (iii) specially designed ice-breakers of 2,000 h.p. and over (definitionL to be clarified);...... ...   (iv) all ships capable of more than 15 knots when in calm water andunder the most favourable conditions of load;
(v) all ships designed to accommodate 200 or more passengers;(vi) coasters under 1,000 g.r.t.;(vii) ships with bow or stern unloading arrangements includingdoors, ramps and train or car ferry layout;(viii) ships with special design or facilities to permit launching orlanding of aircraft;(ix) ships with lifting gear over 50 tons capacity.II. Control of Non-Embargoed TypesAll other merchant ships (including fish factory ships) above 1,000 g.r.t. andseagoing tugs to be retained on List II, the exact method of control being left open for discussion in Paris. Dredgers and small ice-breakers to be retained asseparate List II items as at present.III. Incorporation of Objectionable Features and Controlled Items in Vesselsbeing sold to the Soviet blocWith respect to the construction of new ships for the Soviet bloc and the saleof second-hand ships, or their fitting out for sale, to the Soviet bloc, it is proposedthat steps should be taken as necessary.(i) To avoid the incorporation of any of the following features:  (a) special strengthening or construction to facilitate the fitting of weapons or warlike equipment;(b) fitting of protective armour or any defensive structure;(c) preparation for installing degaussing or demagnetising equipment;(d) abnormal fuel capacity;(e) abnormal electrical generating capacity;(ii) To avoid the installation of munitions items and to remove them beforesale if already installed.(iii) To avoid the installation of important items on the International EmbargoList (as already agreed).IN-Completion of New ShipsWork which contributes significantly to the completion of a new ship for theSoviet bloc should be governed by the same rules as the construction of a completeship for the bloc, i.e., the completion of List I and Munitions List ships should be prohibited and that of List II ships should be appropriately charged against a quotaor justified under the 3 (d) procedure.V. Repairs and Alterations to Vessels Owned by the Soviet bloc(1) Any work which would lead to transforming a vessel or hull into a vesselappearing on List I or the Munitions List should be prohibited.(2) All repairs or alterations entailing the installation or replacement of anypart of equipment included in List I or the Munitions List, or resulting in the addition of any of the special features listed in paragraphs I and (i) above, should be prohibited.(3) All repairs or alterations entailing the installation or replacement of anypart of equipment appearing in List II should be subjected to controland placed to the debit of the repairing country&apos;s quota for that article.(4) In any case where paragraph V (2) above conflicts with national law or withrequirements of Classification Societies or international treaties,conventions or usages, it is understood that exceptions to the foregoingwill be, necessary. It is also understood that exceptions may benecessary for the same reasons, in respect of List II items, where therepairing country&apos;s quota is insufficient or where the items are underquid pro quo rather than &quot; quota &quot; control.
