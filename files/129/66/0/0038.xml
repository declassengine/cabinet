1 . c7(TH^toCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC iVIAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIALCAB IN FT office-(54) 88 RECORD COPY COPY NO*-5TH MARCH, 1954CABINETCARLTON HOUSE TERRACEMemorandum by the Minister of WorksMy colleagues will know that the Labour government decided that Carlton House Terrace should be rebuilt as offices for theForeign Office.    An architect, Mr. Louis de Soissons, was commissionedand went ahead with his plans.2. The Commissioners of Crown Lands own the site and, onthe strong advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission, their policy has beenthat the Nash facade should be retained:  this inevitably imposes a limitation on the full development of the site and substantially increases the cost of construction.    The Commissioners have considered the use of the sitefor houses, flats, clubs, embassies, hotels and offices.    They came to theconclusion that the use which would give the surest return was as offices,and welcomed the suggestion that the whole Terrace should be used to house the Foreign Office.    It is doubtful whether any private developer would find it an attractive proposition to reconstruct the whole Tesrace as officesif he had to retain the Nash facade.3. The Foreign Office are pressing for new premises.    In 1938the number of Foreign Office staff in London was about 800;  now it is over 1,800.    The Downing Street office is no longer big enough and more-over is an old building incapable of being adapted to the present-day needsof the Service.    The result is that the Foreign Office Headquarters staff are now spread over seven buildings in London, as shown in the attachedschedule.4. Carlton House Terrace is the only site available in the whithall area and, in any case, the present structure is in bad condition and is costing us more and more just to keep it from falling down.    Thereconstruction is estimated to cost about  4f millions and when it is completed would provide for 1,560 staff.    In addition there will be thecost of buying or leasing the site.    This is an exceedingly high capital cost, largely due to the fact that the retention of the Nash facadenecessitates uneconomical planning with lofty rooms.5. It would be more economical to pull the whole of Carlton HouseTerrace down and start again.    But the Royal Fine Art Commission hastwice, in 1945 and 1948, strongly recommended that the facade should bekept.    Mr. de Soissons&apos; plan provides for this.    In 1950 there wascontroversy about his proposal to add 14 feet to each of the two blocks..This addition would be well set back from the Mall frontage.    The designwas accepted by the Royal Fine Art Commission in 1951 when they were told that the proposed increase in height was necessary in order to provide
issthe accommodation required by the Foreign Office,,    Final plans have notyet been submitted to the Crown Lands Commissioners, but there have beenconsultations with them.    I will have a model of the proposals for mycolleagues to see at the meeting of the Cabinet.6. If we decide not to build, then within test years it will benecessary to spend a large sum to keep the Terrace from falling down.7. There are in hand three large Crown buildings in London -Whitehall Gardens, the Colonial Office and Horseferry Road8    Am I tore build Carlton House Terrace, when expenditure on these buildings passesits peak in 1956/57?D.E.Ministry of Works, S.
