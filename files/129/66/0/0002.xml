(54) 5211th February, 1954: &quot;&quot;-CABINET OFFKRECORD COPYCABINETATOMIC ENERGY EXTERNAL POLICY: BELGIAN CONGODEVELOPMENTMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilLast April we considered our policy concerning the renewal of the Inter-Governmental Agreement of 1944 between the United Kingdom, the United Statesand Belgium for the supply of Congo uranium to the Combined Development&apos;Agency (C.D.A.) and decided that the United Kingdom should take part in thenegotiations for a new Agreement, but that we should make it our aim to avoidaccepting responsibility for more than 10 per cent, of any further expenditure incurred by the Agency in the Congo (C.C. (53) 28th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. The Union Miniere du Haut Katanga (the Belgian Company) which minesuranium on behalf of the CD.A. in the Congo), now requires from the Agencyadditional sums of $6 million to complete the treatment plant and $14 million for continued exploration work. Under the terms of our association with theUnited States in the C.D.A., the United Kingdom is committed to a 50 per cent,share of any advances made by the Agency.3. In the attached memorandum my Department, in consultation with theOfficial Committee on Atomic Energy, has examined the implications of reducingthe United Kingdom contribution in the context of our broad interest in the C.D.A.and has concluded that it would be to the United Kingdom&apos;s advantage, in the lightof changed circumstances, if we were to reconsider our decision of April last.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already undertaken to provide through theC.D.A. 50 per cent, of the actual cost of the treatment plant; the $6 million now required is the excess of the probable cost over the original estimate and we cannot reasonably refuse now to honour this commitment.5. It is also suggested that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should join on an equalbasis with our United States partner in the CD.A. in providing the advance of $14million spread over four years for exploration and development.6. When we took the decision mentioned in paragraph 1 above, we hopedthat an arrangement could be made to ensure to us supplies of Australian uraniumoutside the C.D.A. for our industrial programme. This has not proved possible.We must therefore continue for some years to rely on the C.D.A. for virtually all oururanium supplies. Our interest&apos; accordingly lies, at least for the time being, in maintaining full participation in the C.D.A.7. The Belgian Congo is a major source of uranium for the C.D.A.; and underthe Anglo-American Declaration of Trust of 1944, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are committed to provide 50 per cent, of all funds required by the Agency for the per-formance of its functions. The United Kingdom is at liberty to&apos; contribute less than50 per cent, in sterling, but in that case the balance would be made up to 50 per cent.45681b
by reduction of the dollar payments which the United States Government make toHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the quarterly settlement, for uranium allocated. Itis true that in certain C.D.A. transactions with Commonwealth suppliers theUnited Kingdom contribution in sterling has under pressure from the suppliersbeen reduced below 50 per cent. This had had the effect of transferring to theCommonwealth suppliers dollars which would otherwise have come to the UnitedKingdom.   Belgium has not suggested any similar arrangement.8;. ...We.can reduce our effective contribution,to. the project by agreeing withthe Americans that the basis of our 50/50 partnership in the Agency should be revised.Alternatively, we,, pan withdraw our. contribution altogether, in which,case the Congo would become an independent United States source of uranium.(The Americans have already indicated that, though they would greatly preferUnited Kingdom participation, they are prepared if necessary to meet the BelgianCompany&apos;s request alone.) Either alternative would be undesirable at a time when our requirements of uranium from the C.D.A. are increasing; moreover, we may shortly wish to take advantage of our equal standing in the Agency to persuade the americans to join with us in trying to arrange for part of the Agency&apos;s uraniumsupplies to be used for power purposes.9.   There are, admittedly, two elements of risk in the proposals:  (a) The current Agreement with the Belgian Government ends in 1956 and,unless it is renewed, there is of course no guarantee that the Agencywill obtain an adequate return in uranium. Negotiations with the belgians are, however, proceeding and are expected to result in a new agreement. Moreover, the Agency is taking steps to safeguard its financial interest should these negotiations fail.(b) Uranium discoveries may not come up to expectations.   This, however,.. according to the expert advice available to the United States and united Kingdom authorities, is a reasonable mining risk. Unless this risk is taken, uranium output from the Congo will fall before 1960 witha consequent loss of up to 20 per cent, of total supplies available to theC.D.A. at that time.10. In the light of these considerations, I recommend to my colleagues thatthey agree to 50 per cent. United Kingdom participation in sterling in the proposedadvances.m --v-v &amp; fv- - ^ S.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,9th February, 1954.
ANNEX 1Uranium Supplies:  United Kingdom Policy on Uranium Procurement andthe Belgian Congo Uranium agreement on 21st April, 1953 the Cabinet approved (C.C. (53) 28th Conclusions,Minute 9) the proposals in C. (53) 129 on United Kingdom external policy con-cerning atomic energy matters and, in particular, uranium procurement. the broad objective of these proposals was to build up a joint Commonwealth effort in the atomic field which, inter alia, would assure the United Kingdom of Common-wealth uranium supplies, independent of the Anglo-American Combined Develop-ment Agency (C.D.A.),* for our future requirements for industrial purposes. In this context the Cabinet also considered C. (53) 130 on the Belgian Congo uraniumagreement and decided that, although we were unlikely to require further Congouranium for military or civil purposes, the United Kingdom should none the lesstake part in the negotiations for a new Agreement, but should aim to avoid acceptingresponsibility for more than 10 per cent, of any expenditure incurred.Supplies of Uranium from the Commonwealth for United Kingdom IndustrialPurposes2. In the last nine months, the circumstances in which these decisions were taken have changed. In particular no definite understanding with the Australiansabout supplies of uranium outside the CD.A. is likely in the near future. Inaccordance with the recommendation in C. (54) 7, which the Cabinet approved on12th January, 1954 (C.C. (54) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 3), our policy is to offer\ both the Australians and the South Africans technical information on reactortechnology in the hope that we shall be able eventually to strike a bargain with either or both of them to supply us with uranium independently of the CD.A. forour industrial programme. But it seems that the fruits of such a policy cannot bereaped for some years because on the one hand Australia^ uncommitted uraniumresources have still to be proved and developed and, on the other, South Africanproduction till 1965 is committed to the C.D.A.It might be possible to purchase uranium from Canada, which is the only othersubstantial Commonwealth producer. This would be expensive and would costdollars. At present Canada sells all her exportable surplus to the United Statesand we should have to enter into competition with the Americans for any uraniumfrom this source. It seems, therefore, that the possibility of obtaining significantsupplies of uranium from Canada should only be borne in mind in case we areunable to satisfy our requirements from cheaper sources in the sterling commonwealth.Supplies of Uranium from the Combined Development Agency3. As shown in Annex 2, supplies of uranium earmarked by the C.D.A. maywithin two years reach an annual figure of 7,000 tons. Annual supplies from other sources which the Anglo-American Combined Policy Committee take into account in allocating supplies should be upwards of 2,000 tons. Thus, through the C.D.A.the United Kingdom might reasonably expect to be able to satisfy its uraniumrequirements, rising to 1,000 tons by 1960, for defence and research purposes.4. But both we and the Americans have announced plans for developmentof atomic energy for industrial use; the problem of uranium supplies for thispurpose is as much one for the Americans as for the United Kingdom. C.D.A.supplies are allocated exclusively for defence and research needs. Moreover theC.D.A.&apos;s suppliers have been given to understand that their uranium will be used only for these purposes. Even if we or the Americans had sufficient domesticSupplies to meet our respective civil requirements (the Americans may have, butwe certainly. have not), neither we nor they could expect to be free to use them without entering into new arrangements, especially on price, with existing C.D.A.suppliers. The moment uranium, from whatever source, is used for civil purposes,all the supplying countries are expected to demand a review of their contracts withthe C.D.A. and would not be put off by the. claim that it came from domesticsources and that their uranium was being applied only to defence or research.* Canada is also a partner in the CD.A. but takes no active part in the agency&apos;s uraniumprocurement arrangements.45681 b 2
(5. It seems likely therefore that, if in the next few years the civil use of atomic energy is to be effectively promoted and some of the world output of uranium is tobe spared for this purpose, new arrangements will have to be made with the CD.A.suppliers and the United States-United Kingdom procurement and allocationarrangements will have to be adapted to a new situation in which industrial develop-ment assumes growing importance. The United Kingdom may have to take theinitiative in seeking these changes. In the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington we should, however, avoid a formal approach to the United States onthis matter for the time being and preferably continue co-operation in the C.D.A,arrangements, aiming to adapt them in consultation with the Americans as our-uranium requirements for industrial purposes become clearer.6. It is in this changed context that it is necessary to review our interest inthe C.D.A. arrangements with the Belgians for uranium from the Congo.Belgian Congo Agreement7. When the Cabinet considered C. (53) 130 last April, the Americans were anxious to negotiate a renewal of the Inter-Governmental Agreement before June,1953. In this they have failed; and though negotiations have continued it seems unlikely that the Belgians will be prepared to conclude a new Agreement much inadvance of the time when the current one expires, i.e., February, 1956. In themeantime the mining company, the Union Miniere du Haut Katanga, has exhaustedthe capital advances made by the CD.A. under the current agreement for explora-tion and development of the mine, and for the erection of a treatment plant to extract uranium from the low-grade ores on which the project has come increasinglyto depend.8. The CD.A. has already agreed to provide capital advances totalling$13 million (United Kingdom share 50 per cent.) and is now asked by the MiningCompany to provide an additional $6 million to meet the increased cost of thetreatment plant and $14 million spread Over four years to finance continuedexploration and development. The Agency is already committed to find the full cost of the plant and this must be completed this year to maintain uranium suppliesunder the current Agreement. The effect on production of stopping exploration anddevelopment will be slight before 1956, but is likely to cause a sharp drop in outputby 1958-59. Our American partners in the C.D.A., who have conducted thetechnical discussions with the Belgians on these proposals, are satisfied, from the standpoint of good mining practice and from geological and mining knowledge ofthe area, that the proposals are right and necessary if the object is to maintainuranium output from the Congo, to ensure maximum production during the currency of the present Agreement and to keep the project flourishing after 1958.Our own mining consultant agrees.9. The further C.D.A. advances now proposed will not bring commensuratebenefit in terms of uranium to the Agency unless the Inter-Governmental Agree-ment is renewed. Even then there is the risk, always inherent in mining work, thatthe expenditure on exploration will not lead to uranium discoveries and output ofthe order expected. The Americans are prepared, and indeed anxious, to take these risk and are pressing the United Kingdom to join with them in making available the additional finance required by Union Miniere. This would be subject to an understanding with the mining company which would ensure that, in the event ofthe current Agreement lapsing, the Agency should be free to stop its contributions to exploration and development and should have a claim on the Company forreasonable reimbursement of advances previously made if it continues to produceuranium.10. The United Kingdom is invited to join with the Americans in approving the provision of the further advances on these terms. Apart from accepting a.50 per cent, share in these as in previous advances, there seem to be three possible courses open to us:  (a) To pay 50 per cent, of the additional $6 million required to complete thetreatment plant (to which the CD.A. is already committed), but to try and carry the Americans with us in making any further advances forexploration and development contingent on prior agreement with theBelgian Government to renew the Inter-Governmental Agreement.
(b) To accept the proposals on the understanding that the United kingdom contribution to the sums required is to be less than 50 per cent.(c) To dissociate ourselves entirely from the Americans in this matter.11. Course (a) has already been pressed upon the Americans without success.They clearly wish to gamble on the renewal of the Inter-Governmental agreement and consider the greater risk is a serious drop in Congo uranium output in 1958.If we show further reluctance to share the risk they will go on alone.: . 12, As regards Course (b), to reduce effectively our share of the advances itwould be necessary to obtain American agreement to a change in the Agency&apos;sconstitution. Under the Declaration of Trust setting up the CD.A., the UnitedKingdom is committed to provide 50 per cent, of the finance required by the agency for the performance of its functions. Thus if we make any initial contribution in sterling less than 50 per cent., the balance will be deducted from the UnitedKingdom&apos;s dollar credit in the C.D.A. accounts and to that extent we should be putting dollars instead of sterling at risk. Thus in whatever way we vary the sterling element in our contribution to these initial advances, that contributionunder the Declaration of Trust will be 50 per cent.The payments now proposed are, in effect, interest-free advances recoverableover a period of years, provided sufficient uranium is produced. Thus it is only inthe event of the failure, from whatever cause, of the scheme to supply sufficienturanium to the C.D.A. to enable recovery to be made, that in the long run theUnited Kingdom can be called upon to bear any loss. As, however, there is apossibility of loss and in any case recovery would take several years to achieve, itseems important that sterling rather than our dollars should be at risk.If, as seems likely, the Congo uranium continues to be allocated to the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom would make this recovery in dollars. The higher the sterling element in our initial payments, the greater is this &quot; dollar benefit.&quot;Whether or not we should continue to retain this &quot; dollar benefit&quot; or pass it onto the Belgians would be a matter for consideration, but it is not an immediateissue. It will arise in a more direct way (and, subject to the workings of theEuropean Payments Union, the dollar benefit will be much larger) in connectionwith the full payments for the uranium when it is delivered, since the UnitedKingdom is also committed to provide 50 per cent, of these payments.It is possible that in the course of negotiations for a new Inter-GovernmentalAgreement, the C.D.A. will be pressed by the Belgians for more dollars on thegrounds that their material is going to the United States. This argument would bedifficult to counter and we should probably have to make the best bargain we could,possibly by giving the Belgians part of the dollar benefit that would otherwise accrue to the United Kingdom. But there seems no occasion for us spontaneously to offerat this stage any concession and any attempt to meet this problem by reducing our financial stake in the CD.A. would have wider implications than the Congo.It seems doubtful whether any attempt at this stage to reduce the UnitedKingdonrs financial participation in the Congo would yield any advantage. Itmight lose us some dollar benefit; it might weaken our influence in the negotiationsfor a new Inter-Governmental Agreement; and we might be suspected of merelytrying to put a bigger proportion of the risk of the present proposals on theshoulders of the Americans. :13. To dissociate ourselves completely from the present proposals (Course (c))would involve a re-interpretation of our obligations to the CD.A. under theDeclaration of Trust and make it difficult for us to claim any share of Congouranium should we wish to do so. At a, time when it looks as though we shallbe wanting an increased share of the C.D.A. cake it seems doubtful policy to refuseto co-operate with the Americans in maintaining its size. Moreover, we shouldbe in a stronger position for urging changes (see paragraph 5) in the C.D.A.&apos;arrangements, if we have shown ourselves ready to back its efforts to maintain its-supplies.14. In the light of the Cabinet decision (CC. (28) 53) concerning UnitedKingdom participation in the negotiations for the renewal of the Inter-Govern-mental Agreement on Belgian Congo uranium and the general circumstances ofuranium procurement, it seems necessary to ask Ministers to decide what course should be taken on the present proposals for additional capital advances to theUnion Miniere du Haut Katanga.  It is for consideration whether the best course
after all would not be to accept our 50 per cent, share in the proposed advances to the mining company and to make this contribution in sterling on the under-standing that, if the Belgians show dissatisfaction with the present payment arrange-ments, we should then try and make the best bargain we can with them.ANNEX 2A.
