(54)757/2 February, 1954^fl CABINETBRITISH HONDURASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesH In C. (53) 329 I sought the advice of my colleagues on constitutional develop-1  ments in British Honduras, in the light of events in British Guiana and the fact thatthe only properly organised Party in British Honduras, the People&apos;s United PartyH     (P.U.P.), was anti-British and was suspected of being supported financially andotherwise by the Guatemalan Government.   The Cabinet concluded that thereshould be no modification of the plan for bringing the new Constitution intooperation this Spring (C.C. (53) 70th Conclusions, Minute 6).?     P.U.P. Relations with Guatemala2. Evidence has recently come to light which, if genuine, proves that theleaders of the P.U.P. have sought aid from Guatemala. This evidence consists ofa memorandum (Annex A) which the Party is alleged to have sent in January, 1953by the hand of its leader-Leigh Richardson-to the then Guatemalan ForeignH Minister. This document came into the hands of the British Honduras Govern-ment a few weeks ago though its existence has been known since July, 1953. Itcontains a specific request to the Guatemalan Foreign Minister to honour aprevious promise of assistance towards the purchase of printing machinery. I alsoattach (Annex B) a summary of information, received from agents, of other allegedcontacts between the Party and the Guatemalan Government.Course of Action3. I think the memorandum must clearly be published, and further that wemust have an impartial enquiry made into its authenticity. The Governor has noreal doubt that the document is genuine, but its authenticity will certainly be^^fl challenged and we must stand on safe ground.  I accordingly propose that thedocument should be published immediately as a sessional paper of the BritishHonduras Legislative Council with a covering note saying that the documentappears to be genuine and that, in view of its serious implications, a Commissionwill be appointed to enquire into its authenticity and into other current allegations19 of links between the P.U.P. and Guatemala. The Governor is prepared to producefor this enquiry the person referred to in Annex B as source graded &quot; A,&quot; and otherwitnesses. I propose that the Commission should be sent out from this country.It might consist of a legal authority and a technical expert.
?Hfl m^rnmPlans for Constitutional Advance     Jjt^ . ,4. The Bill providing for the new Constitution will come before theLegislative Council of the Colony in March and it is hoped to hold the electionson 23rd April. At the moment I would not recommend any modification of thisprogramme, but if the Commission establishes the authenticity of the documentsBV^H and substantiates the existence of intimate links between the P.U.F. leaders and    IP ^L^L\the Guatemalan Government, it may be necessary to consider whether it is reallywise to,go ahead with these constitutional changes. { sWytConclusion5. I recommend that the document at Annex A should be published as aHwH               sessional paper of the Legislative Council of British Honduras as soon as possible;that an immediate enquiry be held into its authenticity, and that for the momentthere should be no modification in the constitutional plans. When the report ofthe enquiry is available I will again report to my colleagues.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,12th February, 1954.I        &apos;I &quot; III        1 ill
I ; ANNEX AI MEMORANDUM TO THE MINISTER(&apos;) JANUARY 29, 1953The purpose of Mr. R&apos;s(2) trip is to accompany his motBfer-in-law who is ill,I       and he will leave her in hospital.  Taking the opportunity afforded by his trip,VaVJ we recommended to him certain affairs we wish to discuss because we consider ?AVJthem of great importance.I We refer to the offer which the Minister made on the occasion of the visit ofthe newspaperman PGO in September of 1951 about the help which the Ministry KfHwould give in order to acquire printing material for the plant which prints theVaVJ newspaper Belize Billboard. At that time the Consul said that it would be possibleto give a limited amount of help and that he was passing on that information oninstructions from the Minister, telhng us that they could let us have betweenfive and six thousand dollars. He was sorry that it was not possible to give thetotal asked for due to budget difficulties. Time went by, and the offer was neverI fulfilled. That is why he now presents himself with this problem in view of theurgency and with the purpose of obtaining an answer, since the equipment whichis in use is leased, and as a consequence we would be forced to suspend thenewspaper which is in the forefront of the anti-colonial battle, combining its effortswith the GWUC), since the newspaper is the official voice of the party.H The present ConsulC) has told us confidentially that the British Minister inG had called at the Ministry to say that the Consul of Guatemala was notwanted in Belize due to alleged political intervention in agreement with the leadersof the party. On this point, Mr. Minister, we would like to inform you that we,the leaders, met and reached the following conclusions, adding the result to thenews in Belize about Mr. Humberto G. J.(6).We are sure that HGJ was invited by enemies of our movement andenemies of Guatemala to a dinner given confidentially and that he was asked byMessrs. Salvador Espat, Awe and Sylvestre(&apos;) for the removal of the present Consulwith whom the party has been in touch since July, 1951, this being the first time thatthe party has had direct and frank connections with your country, due to the con-H    fidence we have in Mr. Garcia.This gentleman has on all occasions given us good advice and effective helpagainst the continuous and brutal attack of the colonial system and has given usvaluable service in lessening the opposition which is represented by Mr. Espat andhis company of parasites and &quot; toadies.&quot;   We are sure that HGJ promised^^fl the removal, basing the promise on his personal friendship with the President,saying that he could get any change. All this was discussed by the party and it was^^fl decided that Mr. R. should make the trip so that he could have this inter-view with the Minister.2. We wish to inform you through Mr. R. that we would end the relations ^^flfl    which the party has through the consulate if Mr. HGJ&apos;s requests are accepted.Our reason is that a new consul, friend or protege of HGJ would at no time havethe confidence of the leaders of the party.In our opinion, the demand of the British Minister for the recall of the present ^^flconsul shows the effectiveness of the consul&apos;s work.  In fact, he helps the partyand its leaders in their political problems. We would accept a substitute for the ^^fl^^fl consul if he were presented to the party as a person who could be trusted and ifthe consul guarantees the sincerity of his substitute.  In these political problems, ^^fl^^fl very delicate matters are dealt with.  The British authorities use every means toobtain evidence which could be fatal to the leaders. We believe that Mr. ProudC) ^^fl(&apos;) I.e., the then Guatemalan Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Raul Osegueda. ^^^1(2) Leigh Richardson, leader of the P.U.P. who is known to have left Belize for Guatemala Cityon 30th January, 1953.

the chief of colonial propaganda, is nothing more than an incompetent Scotland^^^M Yard detective.We do not see any logical reason for a change at this time because a consulwho dedicates himself, as does the present consul, to help and solve the problemsof the party, would never be looked on favourably by the British authorities. If 9you think it possible, we would suggest that the Ministry wait to make the change ( ^^Hafter the next conference with ORECA(&apos;) and the coming electiaj|s. After thattime, the work of a delicate nature will be less and then it could give in to the absurddemands of the British diplomat.3. The party awaits information about the resolution which was passed inthe UNO. It would be prepared to attend ORECA and beforehand send a repre-sentative who would advise on the part that the party would play in that conference!But first it is necessary that we know the political effects, the benefits and results(possible reprisals) arising out of the intervention of ORECA at that time, as wellas the manner of counteracting the possibly unfavourable results in the light ofexisting circumstances.We await the documents on the last meeting of the United Nations to studythe matter, exchange ideas and prepare our petitions in time.-------ANNEX B  SUMMARY OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM SECRET SOURCESOctoberSource graded &quot; A &quot; reported that he was concerned with P.U.P. activities inwX^M the early days of the foundation of the party.  He was closely associated withTony Soberanis (a prominent worker in the P.U.P., closely associated withPrice, &amp;c). Soberanis then received pamphlets published in Guatemala broughtover the border by the then Guatemalan Consul, Cobar. Later Soberanis offeredSource $25 . 00 a month allowance to supply him with information to be sent tothe Guatemalan Consul who in turn forwarded them to Mendoza(3) in GuatemalaCity. In May 1951, Soberanis had discussions in Guatemala City with Mendoza,ahd on his return attacked Cobar, the Guatemalan Consul on the grounds thathe was only allowing him $60 00 a month British Honduras currency, whereasGuatemala had allocated $60 00 United States currency for his payment. Thiscaused a split between Soberanis and Cobar who had already paid Soberanis atotal of $865 00.November 1951 ^k^kX^^fl Soberanis told Source that Mendoza had informed him in Guatemala Citythat the Guatemalan Government had voted $80,000 United States currency forpropaganda and other work in British Honduras.Source also reported from his personal knowledge that GoldsonC) hadfrequent conferences with Mendoza on his visit to Guatemala, and that Price actedas the principal link with the Consulate.Further information produced from Source said that he acted as a go-between Ifor Pricef) and the Guatemalan Consul, carrying messages and arranging meetings.When Garcia, the new Consul arrived, he made direct contact with Price, and inSeptember made arrangements with Price to bring blue and white flags in fromGuatemala. ?yi|rt&gt;January 1952Same Source also reported that Dr. Perez was one of those used as ago-between for passing money from Consulate to local agents.^mWM : (*) Probably a mistake for ODECA (Organisation of Central American States).  The referencehowever, and paragraph 3 following, are obscure.(2) An informant is prepared to testify that this is a code sign for the name &quot; George Price &quot;      mm ^-wM^mwM                   used in correspondence with Guatemalan officials. George Price is Secretary of the P.U.P.(3) Head of the Treaty and Belize Department, Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.(*) Philip Goldson, Assistant Secretary of P.U.P. and member of General Workers&apos; UnionExecutive Committee.(5) George Price, Secretary of the P.U.P.
^-M       I February 1952Another Source regarded as reliable worked in close conjunction with Price^-W       I and had frequent interviews with the Guatemalan Consul, which were mostly^-M       I arranged at night at the seawall in the Barracks Area. Source also gave informa-mmm imm t*on reSara,hig the method of passing correspondence and the signatures on theijH correspondence.^L^LM Price informed Source that he had received a sum of $500-00 from the^L^LM       I Guatemalan Consul to cover the expenses of the Sedition trial.   (This has beenI confirmed from other sources.)Source also reported that Price was sending information to Guatemala City-MM       I through the Consulate to be used as propaganda over Guatemala radio, and wasI used by the Guatemalan Consul to prepare English drafts of GuatemalaI propaganda sent to this country.I March^-M Another Source also graded reliable reported that Goldson&apos;s brother was^-M       J suffering from T.B. and was in a sanatorium in Mexico City. The name of the[ sanatorium was given. The expenses of this sanatorium were paid by Price from^-W funds received from the Guatemalan Consulate, and this is one of the main holds^-M that Price and Guatemala have on Goldson.  Letters and packets are taken to^-M       I Mexico by R. S. Turton&apos;sC) truck drivers. Source was also asked by the Guatemalan^-M Consul to approach Goldson and suggest that his brother be transferred to a^-M sanatorium in Guatemala City, but Goldson preferred him to remain in Mexico.March^-M The same Source stated that Price informed him that he was using 14 full-timeW-M canvassers to cover Belize during the City Council&apos;s election.   The funds forpayment of these people had been provided by Guatemala.June 1952^-M Another Source graded &quot; A &quot; stated that Price informed him that Guatemala^-M       I  contributed $500 ? 00 United States currency to cover election expenses on the part^-M I       of the P.U.P. during the City Council election.August 1952^-M Source graded &quot; B &quot; stated that he had heard PollardO discussing with^-M Goldson the fact that he (Pollard) was receiving some money from the Guatemalan^-M Consul and was preparing reports which he handed to the Guatemalan Consulweekly.  The conversation took place in the Billboard(3) office.October^-M Source graded &quot; A &quot; reported that his brother-in-law had cashed a draft for^mm\ mm   $6,000 United States currency in Chetumal in late September for Garcia and had^-M given Garcia the money in British Honduras currency. Garcia was in the habit of^-M cashing United States drafts in Chetumal and bringing the money back into^-W British Honduras.   This was at the time of the General Strike called by the ^-M^-M I     General Workers&apos; Union and it was known that the Union received money from^-W outside sources.December 1952^-M A document was intercepted which had been despatched by the P.U.P. through^-M the Guatemalan Consulate to the Guatemalan Foreign Minister. This document^-M contains a party manifesto designed to impress the Guatemalan Government andat variance with the Party&apos;s publicly professed programme.July 1953A Guatemalan Source reported that a letter addressed to the Minister ofForeign Affairs by the P.U.P. had been found. This letter subsequently came into^-M the hands of the British Honduras Government and is reproduced as Annex &quot; A.&quot;(&apos;) R. S.
