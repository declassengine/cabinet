Printed for the Cabinet:   March 1954The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of ...,............................ ................ .....TOP SECRET. Copy No.C. (54) 939th March, 1954OECABINETUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THE european defence community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 22nd February the Cabinet invited the Minister of Defence and me toconsider methods of bringing about a closer association between the UnitedKingdom and the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) (C.C. (54) 10th Con-clusions, Minute 1).2. Last November (C.C. (53) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 4) the cabinet approved the terms of an agreement between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C.and of a Statement of Common Policy for Military Co-operation (C. (53) 332).These texts (Annex A) have not yet been finally agreed with the E.D.C. Govern-ments because the French Government asked at the Bermuda Conference forfurther assurances from the United Kingdom and the United States. These were summarised in Bermuda telegram No. 150 (Annex B). Discussion of these Frenchrequests was not pursued because neither we nor the Americans were prepared tomake any further concessions to the French until they had settled their timetable- for ratification.3. The moment has now come to bring matters to a head. The BerlinConference has shown that we must carry on with our present plans for western european defence and the key to further progress is the early establishment of theE.D.C. Both we and the United States Government have urged the French to takeearly action, and as soon as we receive this assurance from the French government we must be ready to.settle quickly the question of United Kingdom association with the E.D.C. The President of the United States proposes to make a statementof which we have been given the text in strictest confidence. Though it containsno new commitments, it provides welcome confirmation of continued american support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and the E.D.C. i will circulate copies of this statement to my colleagues when this paper is taken bythe Cabinet.4. The crux of the problem is the French request for assurances that Britishand American forces will remain on the Continent in substantial numbers for aprotracted period, or in other words that German forces, as they become available,will not be substituted for the British and American forces now on the Continent.That is the purpose of M. bidault&apos;s proposal that an arithmetical ratio should befixed between the United Kingdom and United States forces on the Continent andthe European forces.  Neither we nor the Americans can agree to establish any
arithmetical link between our forces and the European forces. We must expectincreasing pressure domestically to reduce our present burden of overseas defence expenditure and, with the development of new weapons and as German forcesbecome available, the military arguments against reducing the strength of our land forces on the Continent will not be so compelling. That, however, is looking ahead.At the moment, our forces in Germany are essential to Western defence and any marked reduction would have a disastrous effect on N.A.T.O. Our present military effort in Europe is an inescapable commitment which will have to be maintainedso long as the present international tension lasts.5. It seems to me therefore that we could give the French an assurance thatfor the next few years we will maintain the present fighting capacity of the UnitedKingdom forces on the Continent and that, although the introduction of new weapons may call for some variation in the size and shape of our forces, we haveno intention of withdrawing from the Continent so long as the threat exists tothe security of Western Europe and of the E.D.C. I hope my colleagues will agreethat we should give such an assurance publicly in whatever form may be most appropriate.6 The French are not relying only on assurances as a means of tying our forces to the Continent. They are also interested in forging physical links between british forces on the Continent and the European Defence forces. Various links aresuggested in the annexed Statement of Common Policy on Military Co-operation.These are closer for the air forces than for the land forces. I would propose thatwe should take a further step forward in the field of land co-operation and adda further paragraph to the Statement of Common Policy in the following terms:  &quot;The closest association will be established between the E.D.C. and theUnited Kingdom Land Formations placed.under the command of SACEUR.Detailed measures of association which may be arranged will be determinedby joint consultation with SACEUR. If requested by SACEUR, such arrangements may include the acceptance of British Formations withinEuropean Army Formations, and vice versa, where military considerationsmake this desirable and logistic considerations make it practicable.&quot;7. In order to show that we intend to apply this principle, I would like to announce at the appropriate moment probably when the conclusion of the UnitedKingdom-E.D.C. Agreement is announced in the House of Commons that aBritish armoured division has already been earmarked for service with the Euro-pean Defence forces and that the Supreme Allied Commander has been informedthat, if he is prepared to agree on operational grounds, we are ready to place this division under the command of an E.D.C. corps as soon as it is ready to receive it.I understand that the Chiefs of Staff consider that this is a practicable proposition,provided that the British division is not divorced from its existing British logistic support. If this offer is to have the desired effect on French opinion, I would likeauthority to make it clear that this is not a purely transitory device which couldbe terminated by us at any moment but that, on the contrary, we hope it will be a lasting arrangement which will be maintained as long as the Supreme allied commander wishes.8. Another way of linking our forces with the E.D.C. is the French suggestionthat the German Service Organisation, now attached to British forces in Germany,should be converted into an E.D.C. unit. I propose to inform the French that Iwelcome this proposal and would like to discuss it in detail with the Germans andother E.D.C. Governments.9. The next important point on which the French want to be reassured isthat the North Atlantic Treaty will not be denounced during the life-time of theE.D.C. The Presidents message states in paragraph 6 that the United States will consider sympathetically proposals for that purpose, so we will now join with theE.D.C. Governments in putting a proposal to the North Atlantic Council.10. At Bermuda, M. Bidault also spoke about France&apos;s status as a great power. I doubt whether the French Government will ask us for any furtherassurances but, if they do, I propose that we should (a) tell them that we for our part do not intend to. propose any change to the detriment of France in the composition of the N.A.T.O. StandingGroup;
173(b) offer to reaffirm publicly assurances which I gave M. Bidault confidentiallyin February 1953 that France&apos;s entry into the E.D.C. will not put anend to the loyal co-operation of the United Kingdom with France orto our present practice of consulting together on specific internationalproblems;(c) offer to set up new machinery for regular Anglo-French consultation, forinstance, regular meetings between the two Foreign Offices at juniorMinister level.11.  I seek the approval of my colleagues for these proposals.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,8th March, 1954.

MILITARY ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE FORCES OF THE UNITEDKINGDOM AND THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE COMMUNITYDraft Statement of Common Policy[Text Agreed by the Military Committee of the E.D.C. Interim, Commission]Part I. Common Aims1. In order to bring about the effective and continuous co-operation between their respective armed forces placed under the command of the Supreme allied commander, Europe, provided for in Article II (a) of the agreement regardingco-operation between the United Kingdom and the European Defence Community,the authorities concerned of the parties to that agreement have agreed that it isnecessary to reconcile, on a basis of reciprocity, differing techniques in as manyfields as possible, so leading to a common military outlook. They recognise thatthis reconciliation will be attained by progressive measures of adjustment and inthe light of experience, and that the first step will be the exchange of the necessary information in the various fields. The ultimate aim is to enable the armed forcesof the United Kingdom and the European Defence Community to operate together in the circumstances described in Articles 68 (paragraph 3), 69 (paragraph 3) and70 (paragraph 3) of the Treaty Establishing the European Defence Community,without reducing their effectiveness.2. The following are among the particular fields, applicable to the three services, in which a common military outlook shall be sought:  (a) Tactical Doctrine and Staff MethodsIn order to ensure the best co-operation between units of the two armed forces, tactical doctrines and staff methods shall be reconciled as far as possible.To this end, a continuous exchange of documentary information shall takeplace between the military authorities of the United Kingdom and of theEuropean Defence Community. After the establishment of the european defence Community a joint study group shall be set up to examine the meansof evolving common doctrines. Observers at tactical demonstrations and exercises shall be exchanged.(b) LogisticsThe common aim is to remove such differences in logistics between the armed forces of the United Kingdom and of the European Defence Com-\ munity placed under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe, as might prejudice active operations in the field. This calls for theharmonisation of their logistic systems and the standardisation of their equipment.Harmonisation of Logistics Systems(i) As a first step the elimination of differences in logistic organisation shall be sought in certain of the less controversial fields throughthe agency of joint study groups.Standardisation of Equipment(ii) Co-operation in this field shall be closely related to the work of theMilitary Agency for Standardisation of the North atlantic treaty Organisation. As an immediate step, a common systemof equipment referencing&apos; shall be sought. The militaryauthorities of the United Kingdom and of the European defence community shall exchange all the necessary documentaryinformation on equipment and shall arrange the appropriatedemonstrations.   , &apos;       ; *
(c) training the training methods employed by both armed forces shall be, as far aspossible, on similar lines. This will be achieved from the early stages of theformation of the European Defence Forces by the exchange of personnel andof documentary information, and by the allocation of vacancies in UnitedKingdom military schools and training establishments to personnel of theEuropean Defence Community, and reciprocally. At a later stage, exchanges of units may also be arranged.These measures will in many cases represent an extension of similar facilities and arrangements at present in force between the United Kingdomand North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, and will be subject to similar financial arrangements.The manner in which these measures can be applied in the three services is set out in more detail in Part II.3. It is recognised that the extent to which the common aims can be achievedwill be conditioned by the following factors:  (a) the obligation to conform with the doctrines and policy of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation;(b) the stage of evolution of the European Defence Forces;(c) the special characteristics of each Service; it is probable that the closestassociation can be achieved in the case of air forces;(d) such security regulations as may be laid down by the parties;(e) the resources which may be available, bearing in mind the other commit-ments of the United Kingdom and of the European defence community.   These resources are likely to vary between each Service.Part II.-Measures to be taken by each Service for Practical collaboration between the Forces of the United Kingdom and the European DefenceCommunityAir Force1. In the early stages of the formation of the European Air Force, the RoyalAir Force will assist, if desired:  (a) in the establishment of the Headquarters of the European Air Force,including the secondment of officers;(b) by the secondment of officers, at all levels, to the European Air Force forcommand and staff service, including technical and administrative,and for flying duties;(c) in the formation of the European Air Defence Command and TrainingCommand;id) by providing some initial and refresher flying and technical training, and inthe organisation of and supervision in technical schools.2. When the European Air Force is more fully established collaborationmay take the following form:  (a) secondment of Royal Air Force staff officers for duty with the Head-quarters of the European Air Force and vice versa;(b) secondment of Royal Air Force officers to the European Air Force forcommand and staff service, including technical and administrative, andfor flying duties, and similarly of European Air Force officers to theRoyal Air Force;(c) participation in integrated headquarters&apos; staffs in the circumstances described in Article 69 (paragraph 3) of the Treaty Establishing theEuropean Defence Community;(d) Royal Air Force assistance in the organisation of European air defenceincluding the setting up of close links between control and reportingsystems of the European Defence Forces and those of the Royal AirForCej    .    ,      , ,(e) joint study of the possibility of the correlation of the aircraft productionand air training programmes of the European Defence Community;   ;;  *   . and the United Kingdom.3. A close association will be established between the European Air Forceand Royal Air Force formations placed under the command of the Supreme allied commander, Europe.  The detailed measures of association which may be
arranged will be determined by joint consultation with SACEUR. such arrangements may include:  (a) the acceptance of individual European Air Force squadrons and completeEuropean Air Force wings within Royal Air Force formations, and vice versa, where military considerations make this desirable andlogistic considerations make it practicable;(b) training by the Royal Air Force of such squadrons as may be nominated by the European Defence Community.Army4. In the early stages of the formation of the European Army, the british army will, if desired, assist them in their planning in the following ways: -(a) by the secondment of officers to the Headquarters of the European Armyand to its training and logistics staffs;(b) by the extension to the European Army of the present arrangements whereby vacancies are made available at United Kingdom schools toforces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. (The United King-dom schools concerned are the Staff College, Arms Schools, the Schoolsof Land /Air Warfare, the Joint School of Chemical Warfare andadministrative training establishments);(c) by the provision of suitable tactical demonstrations at the request of theEuropean Army.5. Once the European Army is established the following arrangements maybe made:  (a) Exchanges of PersonnelThese will be similar to the arrangements already existing for the exchangeof personnel between the United Kingdom forces and forces of other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Until, however, common doctrinesare developed by the United Kingdom and European Defence Forces, thelevel and numbers of such exchanges will necessarily be limited and on thefollowing lines:  (i) between European Army staffs and those of the Headquarters ofthe British Army stationed on the Continent, including an exchange of liaison officers where appropriate;(ii) between officers of combatant and administrative units, for limitedperiods;(iii) between students at such schools and training establishments asmay be agreed,(b) Training(i) large-scale joint United Kingdom and European Defence Com-munity manoeuvres may be organised within the framework ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In this case thedirecting and umpiring staffs may be integrated temporarily;(ii) United Kingdom divisions may be made available for training and exercises with the European Army under the overall command of the Supreme Allied. Commander, Europe, and vice versa. in similar conditions, small units of the European Army mayparticipate in formation training with the British Army and vice versa.Navy6. Close association already exists between navies of the countries of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Royal Navy, and will be extended tothe European Defence Community. Assistance during the build-up period maybe of particular value.7.   The Royal Navy will co-operate in the following ways:  (a) by the provision of limited training facilities;(b) by the participation of Royal Navy units in training and at naval oramphibious exercises which include European Naval Forces;(c) by close co-operation with the European Defence Community in theorganisation, working and function of the European Admiralty,including the appointment of a liaison officer;(d) by advising on the development of the European Navy.
ANNEX BTELEGRAM No. 150, DATED 8th DECEMBER, 1953, FROM BERMUDATO FOREIGN OFFICE (UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION)Plenary Meetings, 5th and 6th December, 1953:  E.D.C.In the course of discussions on the E.D.C. (full report by bag) M. Bidaultmade two speeches in which, against the background of the French governments determination to pursue E.D.C. policy, despite French difficulties over the Saarand the dangers to France of integration with Germany, &amp;c, he put forward thefollowing specific requests. He did so in response to a direct invitation from thePresident to say in what ways the United States and the United Kingdom could help over French ratification:  id) France must not be engulfed in Europe in such a way that she would come to be consulted only through the E.D.C., French membership of the Standing Group must not be put in question. France, havingregard to her overseas territories and responsibilities, must not be separated from this Three-Power association and no &quot; European&quot;representative must be substituted there for her.(b) France alone of the Three Powers was obliged to make sacrifices of sovereignty in order that our common strategy might be implemented;but she must not be the victim of inadequate co-ordination betweenthe N.A.T.O. and the E.D.C., which must form a homogeneous and developing body, in accordance with the Washington communique ofSeptember 1951. Better links were therefore required between theN.A.T.O. and the E.D.C. and the internal &quot; discipline &quot; of the N.A.T.O.must be reinforced. France would once again be putting forward proposals to this end at the N.A.T.O. Council meeting.(c) German rearmament was only acceptable to France as an indispensablebut controlled complement to European defence. It was not a substi-tute for existing forces. Nothing&apos; could be more dangerous than thesuggestion that the United Kingdom/United States contribution mightbe eliminated or seriously reduced once the Germans were armed. Itwas, therefore, essential that United Kingdom and United Stateseffectives on the Continent (he did not mention Canada) shouldtogether form a certain proportion of the total forces on the Continent,including German forces. He did not ask for a fixed number of troops for an indeterminate time. But there should be firm arrangements for effective tripartite consultation whenever there was any intention ofseriously modifying the level of either United Kingdom or United states forces. This would not, of course, prevent us moving troops without such consultation to meet an overseas emergency. Nor would itpreclude overall reductions of the N.A.T.O. forces, including our own,if changes in military technique or in the international situationrendered this desirable.id) He asked that the principal Atlantic nations should make it clear thatthey did not intend to leave the N.A.T.O. after 20 years. France was going into the E.D.C. for 50 years and did not wish to be &quot;congealed&quot;in a Europe which might develop in an undesirable way.ie) The French Government agreed with the draft agreement on UnitedKingdom/E.D.C. co-operation.   But it must be completed by anagreement on the equilibrium of our respective forces (see (c) above).(/) They would also wish to suggest some improvements to the draft statementof principles on military co-operation.2. Sir F. Roberts subsequently saw M. Alphand and obtained, on a personalbasis, some elucidation of the above points. Alphand, who should not, however,be quoted, explained that id) and ib) were put forward largely for psychologicalreasons and he did not expect any new formal assurances. But M. Bidault mustbe enabled to tell the French Parliament in due course, with the authority of
his United Kingdom and United States colleagues, that, while France had joined the E.D.C., and would join a European community which would be the political&quot; cap &quot; for the E.C.S.C. and E.D.C., this did not mean that she would cease toplay her present role as one of the Three Great Powers and as a member of theStanding Group. Like the United States and United Kingdom, she had a specialrole to play by virtue of her overseas territories, and there would, therefore, con-tinue to be consultation between the Foreign Ministers of the three countries atappropriate intervals. On (b) he indicated that this merely meant that the french would continue their efforts to tighten the N.A.T.O. machine, but they were not making any new conditions.3. On (c) Alphand explained that there was no intention to tie us to definitelevel of forces on the Continent. United Kingdom, United States (and he might have added Canadian and Danish) forces were to-day in a certain proportion to the forces of the E.D.C. countries. When the German contingent was formed a new proportional relationship might be fixed and N.A.T.O. defence planning should be based broadly on maintaining this relationship. (The implication wasthat if this could be done, France would be assured that the German contingentcould be held firmly and permanently in check and that she would not be left aloneto contain the Germans.) They hoped that the introduction of a tripartiteprocedure for consultation would make this arrangement acceptable to us. Thecorresponding addition to the United Kingdom/E.D.C. agreement would, in effect,merely be a confirmation of any tripartite arrangement.4. On (d) there is no difficulty between us and the French. Alphand said he thought the Americans would declare that they had no intention of invokingArticle 13 of the Atlantic Treaty, basing themselves on a resolution of the SenateForeign Affairs Commission. We could presumably do the same and this would suffice.5. As regards (/) Alphand said that the French defence authorities didthink our present proposals went much beyond our N.A.T.O. obligations. It wouldbe for them to make precise counter-proposals. He mentioned the following twoideas by way of example:: (i) There should be some organic link between the United Kingdom airforces under the command of SACEUR but stationed in the UnitedKingdom, and the E.D.C. air forces on the Continent under SACEUR.(This is, of course, a point which has already been considered and rejected by us.)(ii) The German service organisation supporting our troops in Germany couldbecome an E.D.C. unit. It could continue to support our forces in itsnew capacity. Clearly, however, the Germans must be consulted on this.6. The French intend to pursue these points further at tripartite discussions at the time of the forthcoming N.A.T.O. Council meetings, when all the necessaryAmericans will be present. Roberts personally supported this plan since a tripartite forum is clearly preferable to bilateral discussions on these issues,especially as regards the maintaining of forces in Europe.7. The French have clearly introduced the principle of tripartite consultationto make matters easier for us. If we can get the Americans to agree to the formulathey propose, this will be to our joint advantage, and I suggest we should be readyto listen to the revised French suggestions at Paris with an open mind. The detailedsuggestions for improvement of the military agreement will, of course, require careful examination when they are submitted.
