o(THIS iMlUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRIT ANISIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL-----      CABINET office,(54) 55 RECORD COPY copy no. 6 ^13TH FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETVISITING FORCES ACT, 1952Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for welsh affairs and the Minister of StateThis Act was passed in October, 1952 to enable Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to give effect to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A0ToOo) Status of Forces Agreement (Cmd. 8279 of 1951).    Anundertaking was given in the House of Commons that the Act would notbe applied to other countries, with the exception of the U.S.A,,, unless theGovernment were satisfied that they were in a position to accordreciprocal privileges.    The Home Affairs Committee decided on12th Tune, 1953 to postpone until the 1953/54 Session the action necessaryto bring this Act into operation (H.Ae(53) 13th Meeting, Item 2).2. To enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to bring the Act into forceand give effect to the Status of Forces Agreement, it is necessary tomake three Orders-in-Council under the Acts-&quot;(a) An Order-in-Council under section 19(2)fixing the date when the Act is to comeinto operation;(b) an Or de r - in- C council il under section 1(2)designating the foreign countries to whichthe Act is to apply (it will apply automaticallyto the Commonwealth countries as soon asit is brought into force);  and(c) an Order-in-Council under section 8applying to members of visiting forces,with necessary adaptations, certain provisions of the law relating to the home forces.    This Order must be laid beforeParliament in-draft and approved by affirmative resolution, of each House,3. The Order-in-Council under section 8 of the Act is inevitablylong and complicated, since it must specify in detail the functions which united kingdom authorities may exercise on behalf of visiting forces asthey do on behalf of the home forces, and the exemptions, privileges and immunities which apply to the home forces and are to be appliedto the visiting forces.    The Order, in making all the provisions whichare necessary for the efficient administration of a visiting force in thiscountry, and in continuing for the Commonwealth and American forces theexemptions etc. given by the Acts of 1933 and 1940 which the 1952 Actrepeals, has to go somewhat beyond what is strictly required to carryout the Status of Forces Agreement.
2o4. The United States have ratified the Status of Forces Agreement.France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway have also ratified it0There has been increasing pressure in this country for the Act to beapplied to the United States, particularly in order that their forces should no longer enjoy exemption from the criminal jurisdiction of our courts.5. The drafting of the Section 8 Order at first proceeded on thebasis that the Act should not be applied to any foreign country other thanthe United States, since the United States is the only non-Commonwealthmember of the NoAaT0Oo which at present has substantial forces stationed in the United Kingdom.    We have now come to the conclusion,however, that the Act arid the Order under section 8 should at the sametime be applied to those European members of the NoAoT0O,, which havealready ratified the Status of Forces Agreement and to any others whichmay have ratified by the time the draft Order under section 8 of the Actis laid before Parliament;  and that they should in due course be appliedto any other countries that ratify the Agreement later.6. This course is open to the following objections s*(a) though individual members and small groups of theforces of the European countries concerned cometo the United Kingdom for courses of instructionor temporary duty, there are no formed units ofthese forces here, and, with the possible exceptionof small bodies in transit or taking part inexercises of short duration, none are expected.It may be argued that it is contrary to the spiritof the Act to apply it to countries which have novisiting force, in the natural sense of the term,in the United Kingdom, and may never have one,and that it was not made clear, when the bill was before Parliament, that it would be appliedto individuals and small units.     (The definition of &quot;visiting force&quot; (in section 12(1) of the Act)is &quot;any body, contingent or detachment of theforces of a country to which that provision/&quot;&quot;of the Act &quot;&quot;7 applies, being a body, contingentor detachment for the time being present in theUnited Kingdom on the invitation of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom&quot;);(b) even if it is agreed that there are cogent grounds for applying the Act to individuals or small groups,it may be argued that they will not require all the complex immunities and privileges which it isproposed to confer on the large bodies of american forces stationed here, and that a separate Orderought to be made in respect of the european countries applying to them only such limitedprovisions of the law relating to home forces as are strictly necessary.7. The arguments in favour of the course we propose are asfollows %-(a)  the Status of Forces Agreement was evidentlyintended, and is being interpreted in other countries,to cover individuals and small groups (so far as itis applicable to them) as well as larger formations,,
The question whether individual members or small groups can properly be regarded as constituting a visiting force within the meaning of the Act is unlikely to come before our courts,since under section 16(1) of the Act a certificateby or on behalf of the appropriate authority of a country, stating that a body, contingent ordetachment of the forces of that country is in theUnited Kingdom is conclusive,,    In practice, theN.A0ToOo countries concerned would probablyattach members of their forces visiting thiscountry to a nominal unit for the purposes of theapplication of the Act.(b) We ought to ratify the Agreement as soon as theAct is brought into force.    We doubt whether wecan properly do so until we can give effect to all our obligations under the Agreement to othercountries that have ratified, without the need toobtain Parliamentary approval for any furtherOrder-in-Council, and we think that if we ratifiedbefore applying our legislation to all the othercountries that have ratified, we should exposeourselves to accusations by other N,A.T0G.countries of having acted in bad faith.(c) Her Majesty&apos;s forces in certain N,A.T0O. countries are already exercising jurisdiction and enjoyingprivileges and exemptions, the continuance ofwhich would be imperilled if reciprocity from our side is not assured.(d) Unless the Act is applied to the European countries,persons in this country will be unable to takeadvantage of the provisions of the Status of forces Agreement for the settlement of claims arising from acts of members of forces of thosecountries here.(e) If it is agreed that the Act should be applied to theEuropean countries, it seems to us that it wouldbe inappropriate to make a separate Orderconferring on them more narrowly limitedprivileges and immunities, since -(i)  it would be undesirable to appear to discriminate between the United Statesand other N.A.T.O. countries;(ii)  a shorter Order might require amendmentor extension in an emergency, so that difficulties would arise if Parliament werein recess;(iii)  a shorter Order would have to includethe items likely to prove controversial;(iv) if only one Order is made, only oneAffirmative Resolution and one debate ineach House will be necessary;
(v)  no practical difficulty is likely to arise if the adaptations of the law relating to the home forces which itis proposed to apply to the commonwealth and American forces were extended so asto apply to the forces of european countries.    Much of the legislation whichit is proposed to apply is clearly neededonly when the visiting forces concerned are organised in units and formations and established in permanent accommodation,here, but, if it is applied for forces not so established, it will have no effect and can do no harm.8. For the reasons set out in paragraph 7 we conclude that itis desirable to apply the Act simultaneously to the United States and tothe other countries that have ratified the Status of Forces Agreement,and to make one Order under section 8 in respect of all these countries;and we ask our colleagues to agree that, subject to detailed examination by the Legislation Committee, the draft Order should be laid beforeParliament at the earliest opportunity and an announcement made, thatthe Act is to be brought into force as soon as the draft is approved.D.M.F.S.L.12TH FEBRUARY, 1954.
