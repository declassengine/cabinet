(54) 6017 th February, 1954CABINETSEXUAL OFFENCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsIntroduction1. The prevalence of sexual crime and the activities of prostitutes solicitingin the streets of London have attracted much attention and there have beendemands in Parliament, in the press and from leaders of the Churches for more effective measures to check these evils and, more recently, for the appointmentof a Royal Commission to enquire into certain aspects of this problem and to review the existing law.I have thought it right to raise with my colleagues the question whether sucha commission should be appointed.Prostitution2. The number of convictions for soliciting and kindred offences in Englandand Wales rose from 3,192 in 1938 to 10,291 in 1952. Most of these cases occur in London, where the number rose from 2,966 to 9,756. Opinions differ as to howfar these figures reflect a real increase in the volume of prostitution or how farthey may be due to more persistent and aggressive solicitation on the part of prosti-tutes, which is met by increased activity on the part of the police. But there canbe no dispute that conditions in the streets in certain parts of London are nowdeplorable. They are probably without parallel in the capital cities of othercivilised countries.3. The existing law dealing with solicitation is undeniably ineffective. InLondon section 54 of the Metropolitan Police Act, 1839, provides that &quot; everycommon prostitute or nightwalker loitering or being in any thoroughfare or publicplace for the purpose of prostitution or solicitation to the annoyance of theinhabitants or passengers &quot; shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of 40s.A similar provision is in force in certain urban districts outside the metropolis undersection 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act, 1847, which provides that &quot;everycommon prostitute or nightwalker loitering and importuning passengers for thepurpose of prostitution &quot; shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of 405.or to 14 days&apos; imprisonment. In practice few sentences of imprisonment areimposed in the provinces (there were 105 such sentences in 1952). the fine of 40s.is useless as a deterrent and is regarded as a disguised and not very onerous formof taxation.4. The existing law has frequently been criticised, especially by the women&apos;organisations, on other grounds. Although the law in London requires proof thatthe solicitation should have been to the annoyance of the inhabitants or passengers,the evidence of such annoyance accepted by the courts is perfunctory and amountsto little more than a legal fiction. The person solicited almost always declines togive evidence, and the court usually convicts on the uncorroborated evidence ofthe arresting police officer, who says that the person accosted appeared to beannoyed. On the other hand, if evidence other than police evidence were necessary,45708
it would be virtually impossible to obtain convictions. Most of the women pleadguilty, but would probably not do so if the penalty were greater. The procedureprovides particular temptations to the police to embellish evidence of annoyance.5. The problem was considered in 1928 by the Street Offences Committee,of which Lord Macmillan (then Mr. Hugh Macmillan, K.C.) was Chairman, but their recommendations were not thought to provide a practicable solution.6. A possible course would be to amend the law to provide that solicitingor importuning for the purpose of prostitution, without proof of annoyance,should be an offence, and at the same time to provide for increased penalties,including progressive penalties for second or subsequent offences, and a power of imprisonment without the option of a fine in the case of repeated offences. Objec-tions made against this proposal are that it would increase the danger of womenbeing exploited by persons in a financial position to pay larger fines; and that,if it were successful in forcing the prostitutes off the streets, the traffic would be driven underground and create more serious abuses, including the growth of a&quot; call girl &quot; system. The enquiries which I have recently made in the United Stateslead me to doubt whether these objections are well founded, and a &quot; call girl &quot;system has at least this advantage over the existing situation, that it removes apublic scandal from the streets and at the same time exposes young men to lesseasy and obvious temptation. Such an amendment of the law would, however,be highly controversial and would be strongly opposed by the women&apos;s organisa-tions. I believe, therefore, that legislation on these lines could not be introducedwithout the support of a strong independent commission or committee.7. There is another defect in the law which presents a serious problem. Itis at present impossible to take effective action against persons who let single flats,often at exorbitant rents, to women for the purpose of habitual prostitution. Itwould be difficult to devise an effective amendment of the law which would not bewide enough to expose respectable women living alone to unjustifiable interferenceby their landlords or the police. This is a problem which, if a commissioner committee were appointed, deserves careful examination.Homosexual Offences8. There has been a serious increase in offences of this kind. The number ofunnatural offences of the gravest kind (sodomy and bestiality) known to the police in England and Wales rose from 134 in 1938 to 670 in 1952; the number of attempts to commit unnatural offences (a category which includes not only attempts to commit sodomy and bestiality, but also indecent assaults on male persons and a,small number of cases of importuning dealt with on indictment) rose from 822 to,3,087; and -the number of offences of gross indecency rose from 320 to 1,686.Corresponding figures for offences of importuning by male persons are notavailable, but in 1952, proceedings were taken in the Metropolitan police districtin 373 cases. The increase in the number of indictable offences, which is betweenfour-fold and five-fold over pre-war figures, may not correspond exactly to theactual increase in the prevalence of such offences, but, especially having regard tothe fact that many offences of this kind never come to the knowledge of the police,it is clear that there has been a substantial increase,9. . Experience shows that only a minority of homosexual offenders are likelyto benefit by psychiatric treatment. So far as such treatment is useful, it can be,as it is now, provided in prison, although there may be some scope for developmenthere, particularly when it is possible to open the new institution for mentallyabnormal offenders.10. There is a considerable body of opinion which regards the existing lawas antiquated and out of harmony with modern knowledge and ideas, and, inparticular, represents that unnatural relations between consenting adults, which are,not criminal except in Great Britain and the United States, should no longer becriminal in this country, and that the criminal law, in dealing with unnatural, andwith normal, sexual relations, should confine itself to the protection of the young;and the preservation of public order and decency.  .Conclusion11.   I do not myself believe that there is any case for altering the law relatingto homosexuality and I think that the most profitable line of development is to
improve, so far as finances permit, the facilities for the treatment of homosexualssentenced by the courts; but there is a sufficient body of opinion in the country infavour of setting in train some inquiry into homosexual offences to warrant mybringing the question before my colleagues.The setting up of a Royal Commission or other form of inquiry might lead toa belief that the Government thought that the law ought to be changed, and wouldlater expose us to the danger of receiving embarrassing recommendations foraltering the law. It might also prove to be more than ordinarily difficult to findsuitable members.On the other hand, if an inquiry were set up into problems of prostitution (andas explained above I think that such an inquiry would be valuable) there would be strong criticism if no comparable investigation were made into homosexualoffences. It could also be argued that such an investigation might throw light onwhy there has been such a large increase in this class of crime; and a dispassionatesurvey by a competent and unprejudiced body might be of value in educatingpublic opinion, which at present is ill-informed and apt to be misled by sensationalarticles in the press.12. I think that the balance of advantage is in favour of appointing a RoyalCommission to inquire into both the problems discussed in this memorandum, butthis course is not without its dangers.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W.1.16th February, 1954.
