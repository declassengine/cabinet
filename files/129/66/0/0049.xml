SECRETC0(54) 99 cabinet!::&apos;:; COPY NO.- /f&quot; - R ECO HO U,.,PV--13TH MARCH, 1954CABINETEGYPT;  DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign. affairs have been giving earnest consideration to the next moves in ourrelations with Egypt.2.        As my colleagues know, I have always considered that the only way in which we can re-deploy our forces in the Canal Zone and relieve our-selves of the burdensome commitment they now represent is by agreementwith the Egyptian Governments    I have examined all the alternativepossibilities and there is none which does not in my view entail the riskof an even more serious commitment and the virtual certainty of continuingconflict, ending perhaps with humiliating withdrawal.    This applies particularly to proposals which involve trying to hold portions of egytian territory near the Canal with reduced forces and without Egyptian agreement.,3,        I have always recognised, however, that the attempt to reach agree-ment with Egypt requires an element of confidence on both sides.    the behaviour of successive Egyptian Governments towards Great Britain bothin the Canal Zone and in the Sudan has made it extremely difficult tonegotiate with them    We have now reached a point where we must askourselves whether we can have sufficient confidence in Egypt to justifyany agreement at all.4.        Against this we must set the fact that the re-deployment of our forces is a major British interest and that by the same token we must atall costs avoid being drawn into an even deeper and more burdensomecommitment by any action of our own.5.       An agreement which includes the withdrawal of British troops from the Canal Zone is equally an Egyptian interest.    The present regime,no doubt partly owing to uncertainties about their own internal position,are now showing a strong desire to resume negotiations with us0    They havemade it clear that they want a quick agreement and that they are prex^aredto make an important advance towards us on the main issue which hashitherto held up agreement, namely the availability of the base in anemergency.    It seems to me that we should be able to take advantage ofthis in order to insist that the Egyptian Government shall create thatelement of confidence which is essential for any effective agreement.6.        The first step the Egyptian Government should take to restore confidence is to observe the terms and the spirit of the Anglo-EgyptianAgreement on the Sudan.    In particular they must contribute to the orderly transfer of power by using their influence to ensure that the balance in the Governor-General&apos;s Commission is not upset and that the questionof Sudanese membership,is settled amicably between the two main Parties.They must also refrain from unbridled attacks on Britain and on british public servants in the Sudan.
lcI4&quot;7.        If a sufficient degree of confidence could be re-established a thenI think we should be prepared to re-open negotiations at once with theEgyptian Govex*nment for an agreement on the Canal Zone.8.        I have,, however, been reconsidering the nature of the agreement upon which we have hitherto been working, bearing -&quot;n mind particularly theneed to avoid arrangements liable to perpetuate friction and lack ofconfidence between the two countries.    I think that many of us feel that toleave 4,000 soldiers in the Canal Zone, scattered on technical duties,whether in uniform or not, under arrangements for command and control which are bound to be very complicated, is offering hostages to fortune.It leaves us open, for the duration of the agreement, to the risk ofrecurrent incidentsQ    I would therefore like my colleagues to considerthe following alternative proposal, which might safeguard any agreement reached from these dangers.9.        The idea would be to concentrate on our right to re-enter the base in case of emergency, and to try to secure this right over a considerably longer period than the seven years contemplated in the present plan.    In order to obtain this, we would abandon the idea of keepingsoldiers in the base, and substitute the concept of maintaining essentialinstallations there with civilian contract labour.    The main outlines ofthe plan would be as follows j-A. Our troops would re-deploy elsewhere.    (We might requiremore time than the fifteen months-of the present offerssee E below),,B. We should obtain the right to re-enter the base in case ofan attack on Egypt, an Arab State or Turkey, and to immediateconsultations in the case of a threatened attack on these oron Persia,,    We should seek a 20-year life for this arrange-menfc, instead of the 7-year limit now contemplated,C. Certain key installations, such as airfields, would bemaintained by civil contractorse under arrangements withthe Egyptian Government, who would be responsible fortheir security.    There would be no British soldiersremaining in the base as technicians.    In an appropriateplace in the agreement, Egypt would engage herself tomaintain these installations and to make contracts withcertain civil firms accordingly,,D. The new agreement would contain a preamble covering thequestion of free navigation of the Suez Canal, and making it clear that it replaced the 1936 Treaty.E. We should clearly need time to remove equipment whichcould not be maintained by the contractors, and would therefore insist on more time, probably two years, towithdraw the troops.10.      If my colleagues agree that this would be a satisfactory basis fora defence agreement, I would propose that H. M, Ambassador in Cairoshould be instructed to speak to General Neguib at once on the followingbroad lines.11.       He would say that we welcome the evidence that the egyptian government wish to resume negotiations and are prepared to advance astep towards us on the question of availability.    He would add, however,
that, as the Egyptian Government have themselves emphasised, confidenceis an essential condition of any agreement.    Recent events in the Sudanhave undermined confidence in the ability and willingness of the egyptian government to execute an agreement.    Consequently Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment must ask General Neguib whether he is willing to take thenecessary steps to restore that confidences    If he is, we should be willing to make the Egyptian Government an offer on the terms set outin paragraph 9 above.A.E.Foreign Office, S, W, 1,12TH MARCH, 19540
