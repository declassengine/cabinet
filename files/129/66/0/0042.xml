secret.(54) 92 CABINET OFFICE COPY NOo 70-- RECORD COPY ^-8TH MARCH, 1954CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS Japan Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsJapan after many years of American tutelage is beginning toplay an independent role in world affairs and it is time that united Kingdom policy towards Japan should be reviewed,2Q        Japan and the Japanese are regarded with hatred and suspicionby many in this country.    Nor is this surprising.    As a consequenceany move towards putting relations with Japan on a normal basisencounters emotional opposition in many quarters.    The recent trade and payments agreement is a case in point.    There was a clamour againstthe agreement but few well-founded arguments were put forward either in the Press or in Parliament.3.       Nevertheless it must be recognised that Japan represents a potential danger to the Commonwealth and indeed to the Western world.It is true that Japan is unlikely to be able to wage a major war again on her own, since she lacks the raw materials and the resources necessaryto produce the whole armoury of modern weapons.    But if Japan were to throw in her lot with China, the combination of Japanese technical skill,equipment and drive with Chinese manpower would mean a decisiveshift in the world balance of power.4.        This is a real danger.    China has strong attractions for Japan,geographically, culturally, and economically, and the Japanese are notfundamentally hostile to Communism as an authoritatian doctrine.    Atpresent factors working against Japanese alignment with China aredominant, but, but none of them is so strong that we can be sure of theirsurviving a fall in American influence if this were combined with a seriousz*ecession which involved a marked reduction in the Japanese standai-d ofliving.    The present system of government would weaken rapidly in suchconditions,5.        It should therefore be the cardinal aim of our policy in theFar East to prevent Chinese/Japanese association.    This can only bedone by bolstering Western influence and proving to the Japanese that itis in their interest to co-operate with the West.    The present Japaneseleaders are ready to co-operate, but have the impression that we rebuffthem whenever some special interest in this country is affected.    the americans at the present time are carrying the principal burden of keeping the Japanese in the Western camp but we cannot rely upon themto persevere entirely on their own and it is in our own interest that weshould take our share,
&apos;7oAeE.Foreign Office, S.W.1.8TH MARCH, 1954,6. (1)    I suggest that in our dealings with the Japanese we should bearthese important political considerations constantly in mind and make itour aim to prevent any alliance of China and Japan.(2)    We should play our part in preventing the economic distresswhich would foster Communism in Japan, by maintaining as high a levelof trade between Japan and the sterling area as is consistent with our national interests,(3)    It will be difficult to alter sentiment about the Japanese, butwe should take whatever opportunities occur to effect a change in the climate of British opinion towards Japan so as to bring it into closer accord with the overriding requirements of our national policy and interessees ts.
