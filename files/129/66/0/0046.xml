SECRET CABINET office.(54) 96 RECORD COPY copy no. 5O10TH MARCH, 1954CABINETSALARIES AND EXPENSES OF MEMBERS OFPARLIAMENT AND minister&apos;s memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have been asked to elaborate certain proposals designed -(a) to give Members of Parliament an additional allowance for expenses;(b) to give further help in subsistence or in kind.I deal with these matters below.A.     Members of the House of Commons(i) Additional provision of cash2.        I think we are all agreed that the Select Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions in favour of a straight salary increase from  1,000 to  1,500 is one that we should not endorse, and that their proposals for a non-contributory pensions scheme should not be proceeded with.3.        Members, of course, have to bear out of their salaries unavoidableexpenses which not only are heavy, but also vary considerably fromMember to Member.    As a result, the net remuneration after meetingexpenses is in the average case only  250 a year;  in individual cases itis, of course, sometimes more; but in others it is nothing at all, or evena minus quantity.    The public in general do not realise this.    It there-fore seems to me that if we are to propose anything which will giveMembers extra cash,, we should present it not as additional pay but asreimbursement of legitimate expenses.4.        It is obviously impossible to do justice as between Members withwidely differing necessary expenses if these are met from a commonsalary which all receive.    The logical course is to deal with at any ratemost of the expenses separately outside the taxable salary.    Ideally,no doubt, all really necessary expenses should be separately reimbursedand a moderate taxable salary - probably something less than  1,000 -paid in addition; the effective pay would then be the same for all Members,But this, though logical, would lead to difficulties in control - particularly as the Member would have no financial interest in keeping his expensesdown.5.        The criterion ought to be that applied by the Inland Revenueunder the tax law - that is, expenses wholly, necessarily and exclusivelyincurred in the performance of the M. P&apos;s duty.    But it is one thing for
the Inland Revenue to apply statutory provisions governing the allowance,within a limit set by the salary itself, of expenses for tax purposes with thepanoply of the courts and previous case law behind them.    It would be quiteanother thing for the Accountant of the House of Commons, without thesesafeguards, to attempt to apply the same measuring rod to cash reimburse-ment of expenses without limit,,60        I think, therefore, that we should adopt a new arrangement wherebyactual expenses - certified by the Revenue to be allowable for tax purposes -would be reimbursed within a limit.    This limit should be somewhat belowthe amount which in present circumstances most Members claim for tax purposes against their present salary.    Besides reimbursement of expenses within this limit, Members would of course continue to receive a taxable salary and would continue to be able to claim relief of tax against that salary for any expenses &quot;wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred&quot;over and above the limit for separate reimbursement,7.        What should be the amount of the taxable salary and the limit forreimbursement of expenses under this scheme?    We do not want to go asfar as the Select Committee&apos;s total provision of  l,500o    I therefore suggestreimbursement of expenses subject to a maximum of  400, the taxablesalary remaining at  1,000.    An alternative would be to reduce the taxablesalary to  750 and allow reimbursement up to a maximum of, say,  650.8.        The effect of the first of these alternatives on the average case would be as follows.    The Member at present receives  1,000 and paysfrom it  750 in necessary expenses.    He pays no tax therefore on the first 750 of his salary, and his net remuneration of  250 is taxed.    Under thenew arrangement he would have reimbursed to him  400 of his necessaryexpenses.    He would receive in addition a salary of  1,000, of which the&quot;fyest  350 would be free from tax and the remaining  650 would be histaxable remuneration,    He would be better off, therefore, by the amount which a  400 increase in his gross income would leave him after tax.9.        The Member who has expenses as heavy as  1,400 would get the mall back ( 400 by reimbursement and  1,000 by way of salary wholly freed from tax).    Such a Member at present gets back only  1,000.    At theother extreme, the Member with necessary expenses of less than  400(say  300 as an example) would have a taxable salary of  1,000 as againstpresent taxable remuneration of  700.10,       To sum up the effect on individual Members:-(a) Those with expenses between  400 and  1,000 (presumablythe majority) would be better off by the amount which wouldbe given to them by a  400 increase in their taxableremuneration.(b) Those with expenses below  400 would gain a proportionatelysmaller benefit; but one may assume that their expenseswould rise to  400.(c) Those with expenses over  1,000 would gain a net benefit ofthe amount of the excess expenses over  1,000 - up to a limit of  400.11.       I think that this scheme is preferable to a straight salary increase as proposed by the Select Committee.    But my colleagues should recognisethat, however it is presented, its practical effect is almost identical withthe effect which would flow from simply substituting the figure of  1,400
i 7for  1,500 in the Select Committee&apos;s proposals.    One may assume thatvirtually all Members (whatever their present expenses) will, if my proposals is brought into force, incur expenses of at least  400 a year and will thusdraw the full allowance.    Critics may well say that the Government havepretended to do something which (apart from the difference in total provision)is materially different from what the Select Committee propose - whereas in fact it is different only in appearance and not in substance,(ii)   Provision in kind12,       I have not fully examined every possibility.    But here are some:-(i)     A night subsistence allowance payable to Members livingout of London, on each occasion when they attend theHouse,    The rate would probably have to be that atpresent applied to Ministers absent from home on official business - viz, , 37/6d,    This for 32 weeks inthe year at four nights per week would total  240,(ii)     Free postal, telegraph and telephone facilities.    Thedifficulty lies in devising anything worth doing which isnot at the same time open to abuse.    Free postage andtelephones could not well be given except from the Palaceof Westminster - which would meet only part of the need.And I can see no means at all of controlling free telegrams.Postage and free trunk calls were considered by the SelectCommittee and rejected (as also was the idea of an allowance in respect of motor-cars).(iii)     It has also been suggested that a pool of secretaries shouldbe provided, who would serve Members without charge.I think such a pool would have to be employed andadministered by the House authorities, and not by theGovernment.    It would undoubtedly be expensive, andsome waste would be inevitable, since the numbers wouldhave to be sufficient to cope with peak demands, and much idle time would occur, even in sessions - let alonerecesses.    There is also the question of accommodation.These difficulties are perhaps not insuperable, but they make me think that a reimbursement scheme such as I havesuggested would be easier to administer.Ba   Peers13.       Peers not resident in London are already eligible for free travelfrom their homes to attend at Westminster, provided that their attendancesdo not fall below a certain level.    I see no great objection to adding to this a subsistence allowance payable on the same conditions as the travel allowance and limited again to the amount payable to Ministers (3 7/6d. ) forPeers staying overnight in London.    But I have failed to think of any other wayof assisting Peers which would be acceptable while the Upper House isconstituted as it now is.    I cannot believe that a fee of, say,  5 perattendance (which has been suggested) would commend itself to publicopinion.G,    Ministers14.&apos;      Ministers in the Commons with statutory salaries below  5,000may at present draw one-half of their Parliamentary salaries ( 500).    against his partial Parliamentary salary they may claim relief for tax purposes
in respect of Parliamentary expenses.    Senior Ministers with noParliamentary salary get no relief on account of Parliamentary expenses.15.       The Select Committee proposed that all Ministers should beempowered to draw the whole Parliamentary salary at its new level of 1,500, though they thought that if this were approved there might be some adjustment in statutory salaries.16.       For my part, I do not wish to make any suggestion in the case ofMinisters with statutory salaries of  5,000 a year or more.    But I thinkthat an improvement should be made in the position of other Ministers.This could be done either by increasing the amount of parliamentary salary which they are able to draw or - preferably, as I think - by permittingthem to claim reimbursement of Parliamentary expenses up to  400 if the suggestions made in the early paragraphs of this paper are adopted.    Eitheralternative would, I believe, require legislation.    And we should have torecognise that such arrangements could not be regarded as a permanent solution of the position of Ministers - since under them it might be morefavourable financially (depending on individual circumstances) to be a minister of State rather than to be a Cabinet Minister.D.    Timing17.      This note makes no recommendation on procedure.    But we shallhave to consider carefully whether any changes which we might approveshould take effect in the present Parliament or only in the next.18.      I do not wish these suggestions to be regarded as an expression of a final opinion on my part.    They are simply suggestions for theconsideration of my colleagues.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.9TH MARCH, 1954.
