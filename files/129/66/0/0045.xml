I S3(^isiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL omdh.m- 1   ^, rlueRECORD COPY fC0(54) 95 COPY jntq. qK9TH MARCH, 1954CABINETROAD SAFETYMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMy responsibility for the Road Research Organisation of the Depart&quot;ment of Scientific and Industrial Research (D0S0I0R.), and therefore for the research side of road safety, prompts me to add my support to action on thegeneral lines proposed by the Minister of Transport in C. (54) 87.    I agreewith him as to the importance and urgency of the problem.    That it is becoming a matter of increasing concern to the public is shown by the rising Press activity and by the number of Questions asked in Parliament.One or other aspect of the question is raised almost daily.2.        It is now clear that research can play an important part in reducing road accidents.    Among the concrete results of D. S0I0R&apos;s road research work have been:-(a) The adoption of zebra crossings and flashing beacons;there is statistical evidence that zebra crossingshave led to a fall of about 8 per cent in accidentsto pedestrians.(b) Improvement of rear lights, brakes and tyres.    It is calculated that defective rear lights result in over ,000 casualties a year, estimated to cost thecommunity some  2 millions.(c) Improvement of street lighting.    The Road research laboratory&apos;s work on &quot;dazzle1 has brought out theimportance of this factor, and the great need tokeep vehicle lights properly adjusted.    Manymodern cars and lorries are seriously defectivein this respect.(d) The rapidly increasing use of crash helmets by motorcyclists follows on tests by the Road research laboratory, which satisfied, the MetropolitanPolice as to their value,(e) The scientific study of traffic regulation.    There isconcrete evidence that effective policing of theroads can lead to a significant decrease in thenumber of accidents.
Off3,       Another important field of D0S0I, R&apos;s research is on road-surfacing,,    Here, not only have improved, non-skid surfaces redtxcedaccidents, but D0SoI0R&apos;s improved road-surfacing techniques have savedthe country millions of pounds in road maintenance,    Previously, busyroads had to be re-surfaced about once in three years;  now five years is common, and seven to ten years is not uncommon,4,       In taking the steps proposed by the Minister of Transport it isessential, in the true interests of economy, that the fullest use is madeof the available means for scientific road research,    I will arrangefor the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to assist inany way possible in the road-safety drive.S,Privy Council Office, S.
