(54) 56t I circulate acopy of a further document, dated 3rd December, 1952, setting out the viewsand aims of the People&apos;s United Party (P4U.P0) in British Honduras(Annex B).    This document was sent to the then Guatemalan Consul forBritish Honduras by his wife when he was on a visit to Guatemala.    In herletter (Annex A) it was described as a letter from G ,F.&quot;*&quot;to LicenciadoGalich (the then Guatemalan Minister).2, It was originally proposed by the Governor to publish thisdocument with the memorandum from the P.U.P. to the Guatemalan Ministerseeking assistance (Annex A to C. (54) 56).    I did not suggest this in my^^Hf memorandum for two reasons.   In the first place, the document has beenin our hands since December 1952.    Second, it does not make any requestfor assistance, as the other paper does.    The Governor has however sentme a further telegram since I circulated C&quot; (54) 56 stating that theauthenticity of this particular document can be proved without any shadowof doubt, and that it will show that the P.U.P. had communicated with theGuatemalan Minister before they sent the memorandum asking forassistance.    I think there is something in this point and I accordinglypropose that this document should be published with the other.Colonial Office, S.Wel.,16TH FEBRUARY, 1954.+  This reference is obscure.    The Governor thinksthat it may be a code for a member of the P&quot;U.P.or a misprint for G.P, meaning George Price, aleader of the P.U.P,-i-
ANNEX A!   Chepito, ^^^hT I hope you had an enjoyable trip, and also that at the same ^^^H!  time you have found everything in order,    Ai*ound here all is well. ^^^1In arranging your papers I found a letter from G0Fo to Licenciado Galich. ^^^1I suppose you must have forgotten it.    As I knew that Gene Maestresends off a plane tomorrow I asked him to take the letter to you.    It mustfl        be the one you received early yesterday.MARINAI ANNEX BMEMOH CONFIDENTIAL 3rd December, 1952.1. The People&apos;s United Party has the support of between 70 to80 per cent of the people - a people who, due to its slavery under Colonialchains, is not yet fully awake nor prepared, and is, to a certain point, veryfrustrated.    It is making steady progress towards the country&apos;s liberation.2. In the municipal elections held in March, 1952, under anentirely restrained suffrage, directed against the impudent colonial ^^^h^^fl opposition, the P.U.P. gained 3 of the 9 seats in the Municipal Council ofBelize, regardless of the fact that two leaders of the party were imprisoned,The National Party (the Colonial party) gained four, and two independentcandidates gained the other two seats. ^^^B3. The Party does not have at present any representative in theunconstitutional and undemocratic Legislative Council.    (This legislative ^^^Hbody unconstitutionally extended its life because it feared that the P.U.P.would have won the elections). ^^^1In conformity with a &quot;new constitution&quot;, elections for a newLegislative Council are due to be held in June, 1953,    This new constitutionallows for universal adult suffrage, possibly with a literacy test, requiringthe voters&apos; signature in the presence of a Justice of the Peace.    This ^^^flcondition would not help in any way.The &quot;new&quot; constitution also allows for nine seats to elected ^^^Jcandidates (3 from the city of Belize, 1 from the Belize District, 1 fromCorozal District, 1 from Orange Walk District, 1 from Cayo District, 1I from Stann Creek District and 1 from Toledo District).   Three seats forplj members nominated by the Colonial Governor and four officials: aI president, not elected by the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the AttorneyI General and the Financial Secretary.I This means that the Council will constitute 9 elected members ^^^Jand 7 from the Colonial Government. But there is also another un-favourable point.    The official plan is to divide the city of Belize in
electoral districts in such a way as to permit the Englishmen and theColonial minority to get in one or two elected members.    For example, theresidential section of Fort George can be declared a district which will beentitled to elect one member, and everybody knows that in the Fort Georgettfl     area live many Englishmen and privileged pro-Britishers who arecontented with their status quo.The P.U.P. is strongly opposed to this plan to snatch fromits grasp a possible majority in the new council,,    If Fort George, forinstance elects a pro-Britisher, then the new council would have 8 more orless popular members, and the Government 8 or more representatives.4. The principal objectives of the party ares-(i)  The suppression of Colonialism;I (ii) Self-Government   -  most probably in favourof a Central American confederation.5. The Party has a Council:A Leader  - previously it was John Smith whofor fear of being imprisoned left the partyand got in with the Colonial Government A President of debates  -  Leigh RichardsonA General Secretary -  Philip Goldson12 Councillors elected by the members.6. The Party has an office and a public address system. Itlacks proper transport facilities to cover the districts.7. Actual strategy:  a revolutionary process would equal thebrute force of the Englishmen, but the Colonial System makes impossibleany violent attempts against the status quo.The Party has adopted the process of evolution by means ofelections and constitutional activities - at times even disregarding unjustlaws - with the support of international bodies such as UNO and ODECAc8. The most efficient propaganda which the English have at the ^^^1moment is that the Party is supported by Guatemala, and GUATEMALA IS ^^^HA COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT.    Naturally, whether this is true or not,the English are taking advantage of the international conflict between thewestern and communist powers, and they pretend to destroy our partybecause they identify our party as being connected with Communism, ^^^HI Besides this, the majority of the people is Catholic - some65 per cent and this majority fears any association with countries whichare allegedly Communist.    Once this charge has been refuted, the Party ^^^Hwill take a bolder stand.    In this country the church is identified with thew&apos;m        humble classes of people and with the labourers; and for this reason it ^^^Hfinds itself under an occult hostility on the part of the Colonial Governmentand the pro-British minority who occupy the key posts of the country. ^^^H
