The conversation is recorded inC.(53)169.2.        I &quot;told Mr. Havenga that he must realise there could not be a worsemoment to raise this question.    The United Kingdom could not possiblycontemplate transfer at the present time;  and even if the Government wereprepared to consider it, which they were not, they would not get ten votesin the House of Commons if they proposed it.    Mr. Havenga said that being a realist he appreciated that this was the position.    But what about thefuture; was transfer to be ruled out forever ?    I said the worst  possiblething would be to raise it now.    If it were raised now, things would besaid which must make the whole future more difficult.    In the end,Mr. Havenga said that his Government would not raise the question of transfer with us at the present time.    They must be free to say that they thought transfer was right and ought to be conceded, but Dr. Malan and hewould do their best to avoid a head-on collision.    But he emphasised thatthe transfer question was a constant source of friction and was likely tobecome more so as time went on.3;        I know that Mr. Havenga reported our conversation faithfully to dr. Malan;  and until very recently Dr. Malan has observed our under-standing.4.        The position has now undergone a sudden change.    The information in the following paragraphs comes to me from two secret but completelyreliable sources, whose secrecy must be most strictly preserved.5.        Towards the end of last month Dr. Malan had an interview withMr. Strauss, the Leader of the Opposition.    Mr. Strauss has only toldtwo or three members of his Party what passed.    I have to-day learnedwhat took place.    Dr. Malan told Mr. Strauss that he intended to proposein the Union Parliament a resolution in the terms set out in the Annex tothis memorandum.    The timing will probably be during the Budget debateat the end of this month.    Dr. Malan asked Mr. Strauss if his Party would support such a resolution.    Mr. Strauss said that he must have time toconsider this.
60        I hope that Mr. Strauss may take the following line: thatswhile his party stands by the position that General Botha and General Smuts alwaysheld that transfer was right and in the interests of the Union and theProtectorates,, the decision rests with the United Kingdom Government,and that prospects had been gravely prejudiced by the retrograde native policy adopted by the present Government;  and that it would be contraryto the interests of South Africa as well as to the object sought to raise thematter at this time.7.       Tf the question of transfer is publicly raised either by a resolutiontabled in the Union Parliament or even by a statement that the SouthAfrican Government propose to re-open negotiations, nothing could stop animmediate debate in both Houses of Parliament here and a definite statement by our Government that we could not consider transfer at this time,8.        I have ensured privately that Mr. Strauss should know andappreciate this, because one of my sources of information is in hisconfidence also.    But I cannot approach Dr. Malan because I cannot disclosemy sources of information to him.    There has been no outside rumour ofany kind v/hich I could use as an excuse for an approach,    I think the bestI can do is this;  to instruct our High Commissioner that if any communica-tion is made to him by Dr. Malan, or if any rumour appears in the Pressor elsewhere, he should immediately remind Dr. Malan of my conversationwith Mr, Havenga and tell him that the situation which I have stated inparagraph 7 would inevitably arise.9.        I do not think I can take any other action.    But my colleagues should know at once of this new and embarrassing development;  and Iwould wish to know iihat they concur in my appraisal of the situation as stated in paragraph 7DSWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S8W0lo5TH MARCH, 1954.,2
