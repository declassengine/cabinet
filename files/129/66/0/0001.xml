5CONFIDENTIALC. (54) 5110TH FEBRUARY, 1954COPY NO.cabinet cabinet orp,RECORD COPYTOBACCO SMOKING AND CANCER OF THE LUNGMemorandum by the Minister of health i circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the attached draft question and written answer, Which I propose to give in the Houseof Commons on Friday, 12th February.    It has been approved by theSub-Committee of the Home Affairs Commivtee to which I referred inparagraph 5 of C. (54) 47.The terms of the last paragraph of the draft answer depend onthe result of an approach which the Secretary of the Medical research council is making to the tobacco companies this afternoon.I.M.Ministry of Health, W. 1. ,9TH FEBRUARY, 1954.DRAFT QUESTION AND WRITTEN ANSWERQUESTION: To ask the Minister of Health whether he hasnow received the advice of the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Cancer and Radiotherapy on thequestion of the relationship between smoking andlung cancer, and whether he will make a statement.ANSWER: Yes Sir.     The Standing Advisory Committee onCancer and Radiotherapy have had this matter under consideration for three years.    As aresult of preliminary investigations, a panelunder the chairmanship of the Government Actuarywas set up in 1953 to enquire and report.I have now been advised by the Committee in thefollowing terms :-
Having considered the report of the panel under the chairmanship of the Government Actuary on the statistical evidence of an association between smoking and cancer of the lung, and having reviewed the otherevidence available to them, the Committee are of opinions-(1)  It must be regarded as established that thereis a relationship between smoking andcancer of the lung,(2)  Though there is a strong presumption that the relationship is causal, there is evidence that the relationship is not a simple one, since i$:,(a) the evidence in support of thepresence in tobacco smoke of acarcinogenic agent causing cancerof the lung is not yet certain;(b) the statistical evidence indicates that it is unlikely that the increasein the incidence of cancer of the lungis due entirely to increases in smoking;(c) the difference in incidence betweenurban and rural areas and between different towns, suggest that other factorsmay be operating, ett go atmosphericpollution, occupational riskse(3) Although no immediate dramatic fall in death-rates could be expected if smoking ceased, sincethe development of lung cancer may be the resultof factors operating over many years, and although no reliable quantitative estimates can be made ofthe effect of smoking on the incidence of cancer ofthe lung, it is desirable that young people should be warned of the risks apparently attendant on excessivesmoking.    It would appear that the risk increases withthe amount smoked, particularly of cigarettes.I accept the Committee&apos;s view that the statistical evidencepoints to smoking as a factor in the production of lung cancer, but Iwould draw attention to the fact that there is so far no firm evidence ofthe way in which smoking may cause lung cancer or of the extent towhich it does so.    Research into the causes of lung cancer has been pressed forward by the Government and by other agencies in view ofthe increase in the incidence of this disease and we must look to theresults of its vigorous pursuit to determine future action.I should also tell the House that I have been approached bythe tobacco companies who have offered to give  250,000 for research into this problem.    They have, on my advice, agreed to put this money at the disposal of the Medical Research Council.  /
