Printed for the Cabinet. March 1954CONFIDENTIAL 0fl -, nK Copy No.G. (54) 87 RECORD COPY6th March, 1954CABINETROAD SAFETYMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationRoad accidents are a continuing and pressing anxiety to every Minister ofTransport. There is no radical answer. The problem demands a constantgrappling and persistent application along many lines of attack. The results areseldom spectacular and often disheartening. This is in the nature of things wheremillions of people are about on the roads every day, each exposed to a small butconstant risk dependent primarily on his own judgment in widely varying traffic conditions. Yet, intractable though this problem is, there is no social problem which provokes from the general public so many suggested courses of action.My Department receives a constant and formidable stream of suggestions and advice. The Press fosters this. Hardly a day passes without some nationalnewspaper dealing with some aspect of the matter. It is a regular topic for everylocal paper. Most of the comment is consistently critical of the Government andlays responsibility squarely upon it. As the problem lies in the individualbehaviour of people on the roads this is unfair, but is, nevertheless, a fact wehave to face. Only a manifestly vigorous and comprehensive policy can changethis attitude. The time has come to consider whether everything which ought tobe done is being done to meet this grave social and economic problem which affects the life of everyone.2. 226,500 people were killed and injured on our roads in 1953: 28 per cent,more than in 1949. The yearly figures from 1949 are:  1949...............      ...      176,8001950195119521953201,300216,500208,000*226,5001953 is worse than it looks. More people were killed and injured in december last than in any previous December for which we have records. Road casualties in 1953 were only 3 per cent, lower than in 1934, the worst of all years, when238,900 people were killed and injured: It is true that the population has increased(by some 4 million during the past 10 years) and the number of vehicles on theroads is more than twice that in 1934. But in 1934 there was no general speed limit, no pedestrian crossings, no universal driving test. Public opinion and thePress are influenced more by the crude road accident figures than by statisticalrefinements allowing for increases of vehicles and population. They can point to1952 when the introduction of zebra crossings and resulting road safety publicitybrought a short-lived reversal in the rising accident trend. They press for further government action on comparable lines. All the evidence is ominous and points to a rise in the accident rate which within a year or so might well carry it beyondanything we have; yet seen. This has a political danger which we ought not tounderrate. We are very vulnerable if we cannot point to new and positive policies to meet it.* Accidents decreased in 1952 by some 4 per cent; largely as a result of the introduction ofzebra crossings.45815
3.   There are two lines of attack: - -(a) physical measures to deal with roads and.vehicles;(b) measures to improve behaviour on the roads.4. All over the country along our roads there are places where the incidence of accidents is acutely high. The public call them &quot;black spots.&quot; In such placesa relatively small expenditure can often bring big dividends in road safety. During1952-53 and 1953-54 some  3 millions all told was specially devoted to this. Inour new roads programme recently announced, which is to raise government expenditure on major roadworks from the present level of  5 millions a year tosome  15 millions a year in three to four years&apos; time, I have not as yet seen my wayto set aside a definite sum for &quot; black spots.&quot; I propose to give them high priority,but after so many years of drastically restricted funds for roadworks I must givegreat weight to the improvement of roads for economic purposes. This illustrates the duality of the roads expenditure problem. Measures which improve the flow ofindustrial and commercial traffic do not necessarily improve road safety oreliminate &quot; black spots.&quot; With the many claims on the funds available and inparticular the need for fitting in expensive schemes to meet special claims fromWales and Scotland, I may find it impossible to devote enough money to schemesdesigned to stop accidents, which have been calculated to cost the communitysomething in the region of  100 millions a year. Taking the long view, I thinkthat any roads programme which is to prove politically defensible as well aseconomically sound must provide a specific minimum sum for the elimination of&quot; black spots.&quot; This, in my view, should be of the order of (say)  3 millions eachyear and I propose, in consultation with the Chancellor, to see whether we canachieve this.5. I am sure that a substantial improvement in the standard of street lightingwould do much to increase road safety. Accidents at night are growing morethan those by day and there is steady public criticism of the inadequacy of street lighting, especially since the Gillingham disaster in December, 1951, when 24 cadetswere killed. I do not see how any real improvement in street lighting can bemade until the responsibility for street lighting is concentrated in local authoritiesllarger than the parish council. At present they perform this function in thecounty areas, even on trunk roads. It may well be that wider financial assistancefrom Government funds will be necessary. I cannot at present make grants forstreet lighting anywhere except on trunk roads. I propose to examine these problems further in consultation with other Departments to see what can be done to remedy these unsatisfactory features and what legislation would be required.6. Recent reports from the Road Research Laboratory based on the bestevidence available show that some 10 per cent, of all vehicles on the roads have seriously defective brakes and 50 per cent, have inefficient, wrongly aimed, orbadly focused lights. The number of accidents directly due to mechanical failureof vehicles does not suggest that this is a major cause of accidents. But the extentto which bad brakes and inefficient lights contribute. towards road accidents isquite another matter, although difficult to assess. It can be argued that a man who knows he has bad brakes drives more carefully. Wrongly aimed or badlyfocused headlamps may handicap other drivers more than the driver of the carconcerned. But if most accidents arise from human failure, and this is true, thenone way to reduce accidents is to maintain vehicles so that they make the minimumdemands upon the driver.7. The Departmental Committee on Road Safety recommended in theirReport of. 1947 that vehicle testing stations should be set up. This would be expensive and, I realise, financially impossible in present circumstances. But Ithink it is worth considering whether a system of vehicle testing could be devised which would delegate the work, under suitable. safeguards, to private garages,the cost of the test being charged to the owner.; of the vehicle, although this par-ticular method did not commend itself to the Departmental Committee.; 8. But in order to gain the experience to examine this proposal objectivelyand to assess the problems of supervision of private garage testing which would obviously be required, it would, I think, be necessary for me to establish a pilottesting station where Vehicles could be tested on a voluntary basis&apos;. I propose that my Department should examine this proposal with other interested departments in consultation with the Treasury.
9. If vehicle testing proved practicable, the final objective would be a systemof compulsory vehicle testing and it would probably be best to restrict compulsorytesting initially to vehicles more than 10 years old. I propose to ask the ministerial committee on the Road Traffic Bill to consider the question of enabling powers.10. The human element is so important in road accidents that a very smallall-round improvement in road behaviour would greatly reduce the accident figures.There are two main ways of securing this:  (a) by legislation and police action;(b) by education.11. The Road Traffic Act, 1934, which introduced such measures aspedestrian crossings, the universal driving test, and general speed limits in built-built-up areas, brought about a marked reduction in accidents which never again, untillast December, reached the 1934 level. Bearing this lesson in mind, I am pro-posing to the Ministerial Committee on the Road Traffic Bill, additional powersto enable me to tighten road discipline. A frequent criticism of the present law-is that discipline is directed to the driver and the motor cyclist alone. Mycolleagues have already agreed to extend this discipline to pedal cyclists and, after careful consideration, I think that sanctions against pedestrians (such as penalties for walking to the common danger) are also necessary, and would be acceptedby the public. I have in mind also a stiffening of existing penalties for motoristsand motor cyclists, and, in particular, disqualification.12. New legislation will achieve little unless enforced. The same pointapplies to the present law. Adequate enforcement is vital. Experience has shownabundantly that the mere presence of police has a most salutary effect on roadbehaviour. The experimental motor patrol scheme of the Lancashire police in1938-39 reduced all road accidents in Lancashire by 44 per cent., cut fatal accidentsby 18 per cent., and yet prosecutions in the same period fell by 20 per cent. Themore the police can be seen on the roads, the better all road users will behave.I would favour in particular a sizeable increase in mobile police patrols. It wasthese which did so much to reduce accidents in Lancashire before the war. I amin close touch with the Home Secretary about this. There are considerable diffi-culties in the way of securing the co-operation of the local authorities and thecounty police, but it is my considered opinion that there is no single measure more likely to reduce road accidents than increased police action.13. The basic means of educating the public in better conduct on the roadsis the Highway Code. The present one is out of date and a great deal of work has been put into a revised Code expressed in simple and effective language. Buteverything depends on stimulating public interest in it. I hope to do this by issuingit soon in an attractive form with interesting illustrations, and wide freedistribution.14. Apart from the Highway Code, education in road safety is conductedmainly through local road safety committees and the Royal Society for thePrevention of Accidents. About  250,000 a year is found for this from Govern-ment funds. The example of Islington, where not a single child has been killedon the roads during the last two years, shows how effective local road safety com-mittees can be. But I am sure that if this work is to be fruitful, expenditure on it must not be further reduced. If this had to be, it would be best to cut it outaltogether. This would mean an important change of policy with political andother repercussions which it would be best to avoid at present-   ,15. I am sure, however, that education in road safety and, indeed, most other road safety measures cannot be fully fruitful unless the public imaginationis seized both of the full seriousness of the road safety problem and is convincedthat the present rate of accidents is not inevitable and can be abated. Thatis why I should like to conduct a special experiment in measures to prevent roadaccidents. However promising many possible road safety measures are, it isquite impracticable to employ them universally or to a full extent. The expenseis too great. But if would be worth while. I am sure, to make an experiment intwo areas (say), a medium-sized town and a representative county, deploying ineach a fairly full range of the most promising road safety measures. This would do two things. It would focus public attention and seize the public imagination,and by careful control would enable the relative values of various methods
employed to be determined. This knowledge is essential to any development ofan objective road safety policy. My Department ate working out the details ofsuch an experiment in consultation with other interested Departments......16. The increase of accidents to motor cyclists is especially serious. If you,ride a motor cycle, your chance of being killed is 40 times, and your chance ofbeing injured 20 times, higher than if you are in a car. Police experience suggeststhat the skilled motor cyclist does not have more accidents than any other roaduser. But powerful machines in the hands of riders without proper training leadto the most serious of all accidents. There is a strong case for improving the basic training of motor cyclists. There is at present only one satisfactory training scheme. This is organised by the Royal Automobile Club in conjunction with theAuto Cycle Union and gives learner motor cyclists proper basic training off the highway. I should like to see this excellent, but limited scheme, widely extended.I propose to consult the Chancellor about the possibilities of an approach to theRoyal Automobile Club and the Auto Cycle Union to see whether arrangements could be made for a sizeable expansion of the present training arrangements,financed with equal contributions from the Royal Automobile Club and theGovernment.17. I apologise for the length of this paper, but I think my colleagues shouldbe aware of the critical possibilities of the present road accident trend. I do not,of course, seek their authority for any of my specific proposals indicated above.None of them taken singly would warrant the attention of the Cabinet: theycan be settled with those of my colleagues who are most closely concerned. ButI do hope my colleagues will support me in the view that the present road accidentsituation must be met by a new and vigorous policy developed on the general lines of proposals such as those I have set out. Except for three short periods,there has been a steady and sometimes severe increase in road accidents in thiscountry every year since 1909. The periods when accidents have declined havebeen in 1934 and 1935 when the Road Traffic Act, 1934 first took effect, 1947-48when there was a complete prohibition of petrol for private motoring, and 1951-52when the zebra crossings with their accompanying road safety publicity came intogeneral operation. Imaginative Government action has, therefore, twice reversedthe rising road accident trend. I earnestly suggest to my colleagues that thepresent high and increasing figures are not inevitable and can be abated. Weshould not lead the public to think that we are prepared to accept them.A.
