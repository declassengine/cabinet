CONFIDENTIAL CABINET O-FICE0.(54) 73 RECORD COPY        copy no.^ 23RD FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETPREPARATIONS FOR THE QUEEN&apos;S RETURNMemorandum by the Minister of WorksHer Majesty arrives at Westminster Pier on Saturday, 15th May,about 3. 00 p. m. The route to Buckingham Palace will be Bridge Street,Whitehall, Admiralty Arch and the Mall.2.        The Lord Chamberlain feels that the Queen would prefer very little to be done to decorate the route.    He cites the precedent of the late King&apos; return from South Africa in 1947.    But Her Majesty&apos;s Commonwealth tour,reported and shown to the British public with the aid of modern inventions,is arousing an interest without parallel.    I believe there will be greatcrowds on 15th May;  millions will watch the arrival on television and stillmore, here and in the Commonwealth, will go to the cinema to see what kindof welcome London gave the Queen.3,        If this is a correct estimate, the public will expect a gay settingfor the river progress from the Pool of London to Westminster Pier and forthe drive to the Palace.    I do not think we should go to the expense of putting up stands for the public, but I may have to arrange special facilitiesfor reporters and cameras.    If big crowds are expected special measures will be necessary in the Royal Parks.4.        I should like authority -(1)  to decorate Government buildings with flags along the river and the route from Westminster Pier;(2) to decorate the Mall and to put lights in the trees,which will noL be so far in leaf as at the coronation;(3) to start the summer season of floodlighting on15th May, instead of 1st June as in a normalyear.(4) to concert my plans with the Port of london authority and the local authorities.5. The cost of what I have in mind for decorations would be about 25,000.D.E.Ministry of Works, SaE. 1.22ND FEBRUARY, 1954.
