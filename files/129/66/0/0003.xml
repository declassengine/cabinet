Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1954SECRET Copy No.CABINET OFFICEITlefruary, ,954. RECORD COPYCABINETMIDDLE EAST: ANGLO-AMERICAN policy note by the Minister of state at the request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I circulate for theinformation of my colleagues the attached letter on Anglo-American policy in theMiddle East from H.M. Ambassador at Washington.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,12th February, 1954.I have felt for some time that the Middle East is the field in which our relationswith the Americans are most likely to be difficult to handle in the coming year,and I think it may be useful to you if I set down briefly the reasons forthis opinion.There is on our side a very understandable suspicion that the Americans are out to take our place in the Middle East. Their influence has greatly expanded theresince the end of the second World War, and they are now firmly established asthe paramount foreign influence in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia. They are gaininga similar ascendancy in Persia, and it now seems that Pakistan may to some extent be drawn into their orbit. Apart from these specific associations, the mereexistence of the United States as the world&apos;s greatest power inevitably exercisesan influence throughout this area as in other parts of the world. This raises two questions. Are the Americans consciously trying to substitute their influence forours in the Middle East? And, even if this is not their conscious policy now, isit nevertheless the inevitable conclusion of the present trend of events? I would say that the answer to the first question is &quot; no,&quot; and that the answer to the secondwill depend largely on our own efforts and in particular on the way in which weadjust ourselves to this new American factor in Middle Eastern politics.I do not think it is necessary to argue in detail for the view that the americans are not deliberately pushing us out of the Middle East. They realise that sucha policy would involve the extension of their own military commitments, and itwould be inconsistent with their general attitude towards the United Kingdom as their major ally. It is true that some of their individual representatives in the field,spurred on by enthusiasm for their particular tasks, by a belief in the superiority of American methods or simply by vanity, are delighted to increase their ownimportance at our expense. But in present conditions I feel confident that thesetendencies can always be checked by a proper understanding between London and washington.45690
On the other hand the Americans also have their suspicions about british policy in these countries. Briefly, I should say that they are inclined to feel thatwe have cast them for a supporting role, which is to consist of switching on or offthe powerful current of their diplomatic and financial influence at a word from us.Or, to put it differently, they feel that we are asking them to accept limitations ontheir activity which we do not accept for ourselves. Thus, for example, We are trying to negotiate an agreement about military supplies to Iraq which would;preclude them from playing any part in the equipment and training-of the Iraqiair force or in the training of the army. At the same time we are training pilotsfor the Saudi Arabian air force, which the Americans consider to be as much theirpreserve as we consider the Iraqi. We have overridden their very strong objectionto the supply of jet aircraft to Israel, while raising objection ourselves to theirown proposal to provide bombers for Saudi Arabia. I know there is a perfectlygood case for each of these actions, and I am not suggesting that the Americanpoint of view is justified on any of them individually. But I think taken togetherthey convey to official opinion here the impression I have outlined above, thatwe want to have American co-operation in the Middle East on our own terms and do not fully recognise their own interests there, and what they are doing towardsbuilding up barriers against Soviet penetration.Added to this, they do not really understand our present position in thedefence negotiations with Egypt. The American conception of a negotiation doesnot provide for prolonged pauses of the kind which has now lasted since21st October last^ and. this is beginning to be not only puzzling but irritating tothe officials here who are anxious to go ahead with economic aid for Egypt. I hopethat,  fter considering the relatively favourable comments of the State department on our draft &quot; Heads of Agreement,&quot; we shall now be able to make a new effort to bring the present phase of the negotiations to a conclusion. If we can do thissuccessfully, it will in my opinion not only increase our freedom of manoeuvre inthe Middle East generally but also give the State Department and the Pentagonan added respect for our position in that area.ROGER MAKINS.Washington,25th January, 1954.
