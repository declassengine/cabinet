(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET2a &amp;1 V2ijTH FEBRUARY.  1954cabinet office record copy copy NO.1*CABINETTQM AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILLMETHOD OF FINANCING THE COMPENSATION payments memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Housing and Local GovernmentFollowing, the discussion in the Cabinet on 22nd February(C. Ce (54)10th Conclusions, Minute 8), a further discussion tookplace next day.     We are now agreed on the proposals set outbelow020     Payments for decisions made before the Bill comes intooperation will be made out of the Consolidated F-und.      Theseare the payments resulting from Parts I and V of the Bill.3.     Payments for decisions made after the Bill comes into&apos;operation will be made from the Votes.      These are the pay-ments resulting from Parts II and IV of the Bill.k.     This may necessitate a supplementary estimate to coverpayments for decisions made between the coming into operationof the Bill and 31st March, 1955;    but, if so, it would be verysmall.     It is possible that a supplementary will in any event be required for this period for other provisions of the Bill.5,     In order to meet the difficulties to which attention hasbeen drawn, a provision will be included in the Bill to theeffect that at the end of five years, or at the end of thefinancial year in which the&apos;total expenditure under Parts and IV reaches  30 millions, whichever is the earlier, theMinister shall report to Parliament on the disbursements andrecoveries made in the administration of these Parts.     Thatwill make it clear that it is the&quot; government&apos;s intention toprovide adequate funds to pay for any decisions likely to arise.     The present guess is that  h/5 millions a year should cover any compensation needed.6.     In view of the pressure on the Parliamentary time-tablearrangements have been made to introduce the Bill on Friday,26th February;    and, unless our colleagues see any objection(and assuming that the necessary revision can be completed in time), copies will be available in the Vote Office atk p.m, on that date.R. A, B,H, M,2l].th February, 1954.
