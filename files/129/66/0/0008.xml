document is the property of  her   britannic  majestvs  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1954Copy No.  6CABINETUNITED STATES MILITARY AID TO PAKISTAN AND TALKS BETWEENPAKISTAN AND TURKEYMemorandum by the Minister of state the Foreign Secretary has asked me to keep the Cabinet informed about theUnited States project for military aid to Pakistan, and their associated scheme for promoting closer links between Turkey and Pakistan as a basis for the collectiveorganisation of Middle East defence. The background is contained in the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum C. (54) 4.2. Fuller information since given us by the Turkish Government has revealedthat the moves of the United States Government to further their project beganearlier and have gone somewhat further than we had previously realised. TheUnited States Government evidently attach great importance to the closer asso-ciation of Turkey and Pakistan, not merely as an occasion for their offer ofmilitary aid to Pakistan, but for its own sake.3. The Turkish Government have adopted the United States scheme withsome enthusiasm and have now reached agreement&apos; with the Government of pakistan on the desirability of a Treaty providing for consultation in the politicaland economic field and also for a joint examination of the possibilities ofcollabora-tion in questions affecting the security of the two countries. No military alliance,however, is contemplated. Subject to the final agreement of the Government of pakistan, the Turkish Government propose to make a public announcement in abouta week&apos;s time.4. We have impressed on both the United States and Turkish governments the importance of avoiding any public announcement at a time and of a naturethat might adversely affect the progress of the Berlin Conference. Mr. Dullespromised that this would be borne in mind, but the Turkish Government havenow asked us not to press our request for postponement of their announcementuntil after the Berlin talks, as the Pakistan Government are anxious that this shouldbe made as soon as possible because of speculation in the press. As the terms ofthe announcement are studiously mild, I am inclined to believe that the russians would have no difficulty in finding a better pretext than this, if they are reallydetermined to cause a breakdown in the Berlin talks.5. We have also told the Turkish Government that we welcome the principleof closer association between Turkey and Pakistan, but consider that no collectiveorganisation for Middle East defence can in the near future be militarily effective without our participation.6. The position regarding the grant of United States military aid for Pakistanis rather less clear, as the United States Government do not yet appear to havereached any decision on either the timing or the scope of this aid. Their intention,however, is to announce the grant of military aid to Pakistan after the announce-ment of agreement between Turkey and Pakistan. The American announcement would be preceded by a personal letter from President Eisenhower to Mr. Nehru,whose hostility to the idea of United States military aid to Pakistan is as violent&apos;and vocal as ever.S.
