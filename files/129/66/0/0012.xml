Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954SECRET CABINET OFFICE Copy No.C. (54) 62 RECORD COPY18th February, 1954CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GOLD COASTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesNo action is required on this paper, but I would like to inform my colleagues of recent developments.2. The proposals for constitutional change in the Gold Coast described inmy memorandum C. (53) 244 have been discussed with the Gold Coast Govern-ment. Subject to some further examination of detail, satisfactory agreement hasbeen reached on all points. The Governors reserve powers are fully safeguardedand Defence (including the police) and External Affairs are firmly in his hands.3. I had been concerned about two matters which might prejudice acceptanceof the proposals. The Gold Coast Cabinet have hitherto been slow to take any steps to deal with the danger of Communist penetration. They have now, however,taken three decisions which have removed any doubts I previously had. Theyhave decided (1) to ban the entry of all Communist literature into the Gold Coast(previously only some publications had been banned);(2) to exclude any European with Communist sympathies from the publicservice and to exclude any African with Communist sympathies froma certain number of Departments like the Administration, the police and the Department of Education;(3) to confiscate the passports of the few Gold Coast Communists who wishto travel behind the Iron Curtain.4. I have also been concerned about the possible extent of corruption inthe Gold Coast. I am now told by the Governor that the Commission of Enquiryappointed by the Gold Coast Cabinet into the resignation of Mr. Braimah, theMinister of Works, is likely to finish its work very soon and to present its reportwithin a month. Two Ministerial Secretaries have been prosecuted and sent to prison for two years for accepting a bribe of  150. But the Governor tells methat no evidence of corruption among Ministers has been, or is likely to be,discovered.5. I propose to submit the new constitutional instruments to the privy council in April. A General Election will be held in the Gold Coast in June anda new Government will take office very shortly thereafter. I am advised by theGovernor that Dr. Nkrumah is likely to win the election without difficulty.6. The new Constitution will mark the last step before independence. Itis unlikely that the position can be held longer than 1956, and well before then we shall have to consider the complicated matter of membership of the Common-wealth for an independent Gold Coast. This general question is, of course, underconsideration at present by a Ministerial Committee.O. L.Colonial Office, S.W.1,17th February, 1954.45717
