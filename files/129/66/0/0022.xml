(t(^ document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government&apos;secret cabinet OFFICE72 RECORD COPY copy no. J^j20th february, 1954-cabinetUGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the attached text of a statement on the future of Uganda which I propose to make in the Houseof Commons on Tuesday, 23rd February.o.leColonial Office, S. W. 1.19TH february, 1954.statement i wish to make a statement on the future of Uganda.2.        The long-term aim of Her Majesty&apos;s Government 5s to buildthe Protectorate into a self-governing State.    In working towards this weshall ensure that Africans play a constantly increasing part in the politicalinstitutions of the country, in the Civil Service, and in economic develop-ment.    When self-government is achieved the government of the country will be mainly in the hands of Africans. v3.        The advancement of Africans and the economic development onwhich that advancement depends cannot take place without the help of theother races.    When the time for self-government eventually comes her majesty&apos;s Government will wish to be satisfied that the rights of the minority communities resident in Uganda are properly safeguarded in theconstitution, but this will not detract from the primarily African characterof the country.4.        I have put in the Library copies of two speeches made by theGovernor to the Protectorate Legislature on 20th November last year andon 5th February this year.    These speeches set out the comprehensivemeasures which the Protectorate Government is taking for Africanadvancement and I commend them to the attention of the House.-1-
5.        Some fears have been expressed that the development of Uganda&apos;economic resources will bring in large numbers of permanent immigrants.These^ears are groundless.    We must expand mining and secondary industries in order to diversify the economy and to pay for the expansionof social and other services.    For this outside capital and technical skillare needed and must have their proper reward.    But there will be safe-guards to ensure that the future interests of the Africans are notprejudiced.    There will be strict control of immigration and of the alienated-tion of land, and the Uganda Government and industry itself will trainAfricans for higher positions and ensure proper conditions of labour.    Noindustrial colour bar will be tolerated in Uganda.    The Governor is readyto discuss with African representatives any further safeguards which theymay wish to suggest,6.        It is too early to forecast the form of the constitution of Ugandawhen self-government is eventually achieved, though it is clear that only as a united country will Uganda be strong enough and prosperous enoughto meet the growing needs of the people.    There are, however, constitutional questions relating to Buganda - in particular the future relations betweenthe Kabakaship, the Ministers and the Great Lukiko, and the relationsbetween the Gi*eat Lukiko and the Legislative Council - which must be looked at now so that we can decide on what lines it is best for theserelationships to develop.    The Baganda themselves shxyuld clearly take a leading part in working out these problems.    To help in this, the governor and I have agreed that an independent expert should be invited to go out toUganda.    He will consult with representatives of the Baganda and with the protectorate Government to help reach agreed recommendations for her majesty&apos;s Government to consider.    In the meantime I have agreed that theBuganda reforms announced in March, 1953 need not be held up,7.        In Bunyoro, Toro and Ankole, the Councils are becoming more representative,    I do not think there will be any difficultiess but the Governorwill arrange for the expert to talk over with the Rulers of these districtstheir future relationships with their Councils, if they so wish.8.        The Governor will pursue these matters on his return to Uganda,and, as far as Buganda is concerned, will discuss them with the Regents andwill make an early statement to the Lukiko.
