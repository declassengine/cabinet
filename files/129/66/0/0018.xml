C.(54) 6819TH FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETREPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ONBETTING, LOTTERIES AND GAMINGMemorandum by the Secretary cf State for the home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet have agreed to resume consideration of the Reportof the Royal Commission on 24th February.    It has been suggested to methat one way of arranging for a discussion on the Commission^ report would be to have a debate in the House of Lords and that it might assistmy colleagues if I were to circulate an outline of the statement which theGovernment spokesman might make in this debate.    I accordingly attach the outline of a speech suggesting how the matter might be handled.    if my colleagues agree with this line, I would propose to discuss the matter with the Opposition and ascertain their reactions.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1. ,19TH FEBRUARY, 1954.Outline of suggested speech by the Government spokesmanin the House of Lords in a debate on the Report of theRoyal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and GamingThe Government have considered the Report of the RoyalCommission and agree generally with the views expressed in it.Legislation on the subject of gambling is always controversial and likelyto make heavy demands on parliamentary time and, if only for that reason,cannot lightly be undertaken while there are other even more important matters which require the attention of Parliament.    But there will be fewwho would dissent from the Commission^ conclusions that the present lawabout gambling, except for modern legislation covering only a small partof the field, is obscure, illogical and difficult to enforce and that sooner or later the whole subject ought to be reconsidered by Parliament.One part of the Commission^ recommendations - the control ofpool betting - is the subject of a Private Member&apos;s Bill at present underconsideration in the House of Commons.    The Government have already indicated that they see no objection to the proposals in this Bi?,l and willbe prepared to take part in its detailed examination.RECORD COPY copy no.

The other important recommendations of the Royal commission are those relating to betting on the course (particularly dog-racing),gaming and cash betting off the course.The Commission themselves recognised that their recomrnend-ations about betting on the course might need to be re-examined in the lightof developments after the publication of the Report and, although theGovernment do not dissent in principle from the Commission^ views onthese questions,they would need further study before any final conclusionscould be reached which might form the basis for legislation.On gaming the Commission propose a complete reconstruction ofthe law, which is certainly in a sorry state of confusion at present.    TheGovernment agree generally with the object of the Commission^ proposals,which is to legalise those forms of gaming, such as bridge parties, whistdrives and fairground amusements, which are in practice tolerated,despite their illegality, while continuing to prohibit the conduct cfcommercially organised gaming.    As the Commission recognised, this isno easy matter and the Government does not necessarily accept the detailed proposals made by the Commission.There remains the question of cash betting off the course, whichraises much more difficult issues than anything else in the Commission^Report.    The Commission examined this matter in great detail and tookparticular care to set out very fully the evidence which they received,in which there was a practically unanimous acceptance of the need forthe provision of some form of legal facility for cash betting off the course and very weighty support for the legalisation of betting at licensed bettingoffices.The Commission was satisfied that the present law is quiteunenforceable.    It is worth quoting their words on this point, which could hardly have been stated in stronger terms.    They said:-&quot;To the police the enforcement of the present law is .a task which they perform to the extent which their resourceswill allow and in the knowledge that their action has little or no effect in restricting the facilities available for cash betting.It is no exaggeration to say that the enforcement of the law hasbecome little more than a formality.    In those parts of thecountry where street runners operate they do so in the. knowledge that they will, from time to time, be arrested andfined.    Their fines are paid by their employer and regardedas part of his business expenses: we have seen many casesreported of runners who have been convicted a dozen or moretimes of offences, and one of our witnesses, with personalexperience as a bookmaker&apos;s runner, told us that he hadforgotten the number of his convictions.    In other parts ofthe country cash bets are accepted at offices, which are on occasions raided by the police; the subsequent prosecutionand the penalties imposed do not lead to the closing of theoffice.    We were told by one police witness that the licensing of betting offices would merely be regularisingwhat is a fact in his city, and we have no doubt, from otherevidence and enquiries which we have made, that the same istrue of other parts of the country. &quot;
This state of affairs must have very undesirable consequences;  itencourages disrespect for the law and it endangers the integrity of the policeThere has recently been disturbing proof of this in the proceedings whichhave led to the punishment of a number of police officers in Leeds foraccepting payments from bookmakers who were conducting cash bettingbusinesses.    The Commission were right to point out that the lawrequires amendment not only because it is unfair as between one class ofthe community and another, but because there are serious evils inherent in the present prohibition of cash betting.If this is accepted the next question is how the law should be amended.    The Commission examined many possibilities and concluded that the only effective method was to legalise the establishment of licensedbetting offices subject to a very strict system of control.    It may be thatif steps were taken to amend the law some other method of providingadequate facilities for cash betting might be found which would not be opento the same objections as the licensed betting office.    The Commission^detailed proposals would clearly require further consideration beforelegislation could be prepared, but such consideration would serve nopurpose unless it were clear that there is a large measure of agreement on the need for amendment of the existing law and for some form of legalfacility for cash betting off the course subject to a strict system of control,,which would need to include the registration of all bookmakers engaged inthis form of business.    The issue was very fairly stated by the. archbishop of Canterbury in a letter which he published in his Diocesan Gazette shortly after the publication of the Commission^ Report, in which he said   -&quot;I am inclined to support the Commission^ recommendation myself, thoughvery reluctantly and subject to more safeguards and restrictions than theRoyal Commission suggests.    There is an unanswerable case for a changein the present law, which is unjust as between rich and poor and whichcannot be enforced.    The cure offered by the betting office may proveworse than the disease, but it seems to me worth trying subject to verystrict controls,&quot;If the Government can be assured that there is a general feeling among responsible people that the law ought not to be allowed to remainin its present form and that people of all political parties - for there is no party issue involved here - are willing to co-operate in finding a solution to this extremely difficult problem they would be willing to see whether itis possible to work out some scheme on general lines recommended by theCommission which would be generally acceptable and might form the basis for legislation when opportunity offers.
