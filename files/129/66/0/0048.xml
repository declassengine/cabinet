secret HAdimct ncrio^c.(54) 98 RECORD COPY       copy no.  ^7&quot;T&quot;i1th MARCH, 1954CABINETA NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH scheme memorandum by the Minister of health i welcome the proposal made by the Minister of Labour inC(54) 8 that the Government should accept as a major piece of policy the promotion of a National Occupational Health Scheme.    I feel bound,however, to draw the attention of my colleagues to the doubts I have about the steps it is suggested should be taken and about the assumptionson which they appear to be based.2.      The steps proposed are to lay before the Nat ional Joint AdvisoryCouncil and others interested a scheme for two co-ordinating committees;one of outside interests and one of Departmental officials; the assumptions are that the present measures and methods of providingoccupational health services should be stimulated and extended, withexperiments in some directions, and that only co-ordination is required.3.      In my view this is to put things in the wrong order;  it assumestoo readily that we know that the present general pattern is right.The first step should be to decide what kind of long-term occupationalhealth service we wish to develop, and only when that is clear toconsider what machinery is needed to develop it.4.     The Dale Committee purported to examine and report on some ofthe issues involved, but its work was to my mind superficial and its conclusions have been widely criticised as weak and timid.    There is a need for a deeper consideration of such questions ass-(a) How far should occupational health services be providedby employers (including nationalised industries), or howfar by public authorities of some kind?(b) What should be the content of those services, and how fa.r isit right or practicable to use medical and allied man-power for quasi-medical services in industry?(c) What part should local government play in providing andsupervising occupational health services?5.     I propose therefore that the first step should be an inter-departmental review of the content and provision of a comprehensiveoccupational health service.    This could be undertaken by an official committee under Treasury chairmanship, which would bring forwardrecommendations to Ministers.    The review could proceed rapidly, and need cause little delay; but a brief postponement of action would bewell repaid by the production of thoroughly considered proposals forlong-term policy.
HZ-6.     While my own personal conviction is that central responsibilityfor occupations.! health services should lie with the Health Ministers,I do not wish to raise that issue with my colleagues now; it would,however, probably arise in due course in an inter-departmental x*eviewof the kind I suggest,,I,M;Ministry of Health, W.I.11TH MARCH, 1954.
