Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954SECRET CABINET OFFICE        Copy No.-  RECORD copy . (54) 6519th February, 1954CABINETBROADCAST RECEIVING LICENCE FEESMemorandum by the Postmaster general  ask the agreement of my colleagues to an increase in the TV. licence fee.2. Since 1946 a sound licence has cost  1 a year and a TV. licence (coveringsound as well)  2. The B.B.C. have had to meet steadily rising costs both for revenue expenses and for capital developments, and they are at present running at a considerable deficit which they are financing out of reserves. Their expen-diture is bound to go on increasing, as costs are still rising and the B.B.C. will haveto meet the full impact of competition as well as provide the authorised new TV.stations and make a start on V.H.F. sound broadcasting. The Corporation whoserevenue for the current year (1953-54) is  12-6 millions, claimed  1 from each soundlicence and  3 from each T.V. licence during the three years 1954-5 to 1956-7.This was estimated at the time to yield  64-5 millions and while I did not agreeto this claim, I was satisfied that the B.B.C. must have a substantial increase, in revenue. After discussion of their, plans, they agreed to  60 millions over thethree-year period. This sum includes their capital requirements for new TV.stations and for introducing V.H.F. sound broadcasting but. contains nothing for capital or revenue expenditure on a second T.V. programme.3.   In fixing new licence fees, the following must be taken into account:  (a) Provision to cover Post Office costs (for collecting licence fees and dealingwith radio interference).(b) Adequate provision for the needs of the B.B.C. to develop their services.(c) A contribution to the Exchequer.(d) The desirability of making a grant from licence revenue to the new TV.Authority to be established under the Television Bill.4. I raised this last question paragraph 3 (d) in C (53) 342, but considerationof it was deferred (C.C. (53) 77th Conclusions, Minute. 5), For the following reasons strongly urge that an independent source of revenue should be provided for thenew Authority and I feel that this should come from licence revenue:  (a) It would strengthen the Authority against undue influence by theprograrnme companies and advertisers,. In somg influentia;! quartershitherto opposed tyo our plan for competitive&apos; television much importance is attached to this point, and critics such as Lord Waverley and LordBeveridge, for example, would almost certainly take a less unfavourableview of our plan if this principle were conceded.(b) The Authority must have funds available in case of need especially inthe early stages-to fill up gaps in programmes, to provide material toensure a reasonable balance in the programmes, or to cover the change-over period if a programme company goes bankrupt or has for anyother reason to cease operations.5.  It would be possible to represent this as a departure from our first statementof policy in the White Paper of May 1952 (Cmd. 8550) that the B.B.C. &quot; Should bethe only broadcasting organisation having any claim on the revenue from broad-casting receiving licences.&quot;   But the shape and character of our plan has45723
substantially altered since that White Paper was published; we were then thinking of sponsored broadcasting on a fully competitive basis. My colleagues on theCommittee on Television Development agree with me that the new Authority shouldbe provided with an independent source of revenue and I recommend that theprinciple should be accepted and that the amount should be  0 - 75 million a year,starting in 1955-56.6. So far as the allotment of licence revenue to the Exchequer is concerned,the Chancellor considers such a contribution as the counterpart of the entertain-ments duty. He feels strongly that it. should not be reduced below the present figure of  2 millions a year, more especially as the entertainments industry is constantly pressing him to reduce the entertainments tax; but he is prepared toaccept a contribution fixed at the present level for the three years 1954-55 to1956-57 (i.e.,  6 millions in all), instead of as at present an amount increasingin proportion with the number of T.V. licences.7. The possibility of a T.V. licence fee of  3 has already been freelycanvassed in the press and I think the public would accept it without question. Therevenue expected to result from a fee of  1 for sound and  3 for T.V. for thethree years 1954-55 to 1956-57 is  67-9 millions. This would cover Post Officecosts, estimated at  4-75 millions;  6 millions for the Exchequer (paragraph 6); 1 - 5 million for the new T.V. Authority (paragraph 5); and  55 - 65 millions forthe B.B.C.  Details are shewn in the Appendix.8. Although, under this division of licence revenue, the B.B.C.&apos;s share overthe three-year period would be  4-35 millions below the  60 millions referred toin paragraph 2, their annual receipt would in fact increase from  12-6 millions in the present financial year to as much as  20 millions in 1956-57. If my estimateof growth in the number of licences proves to be on the conservative side, the concession by the Treasury referred to in paragraph 6 means that, subject to anyrise in Post Office costs, the whole of the resulting increase in licence revenue will then go to the B.B.C. I think therefore that the proposed division gives an adequateallotment to the B.B.C., while at the same time meeting all the other claims, andI accordingly ask my colleagues to agree to:  (a) A grant to the new T.V. Authority of  0-75 million a year, beginning in1955-56, out of the licence revenue.(b) An increase in the T.V. licence fee to  3, to take effect from 1st June, 1954.(c) Distribution of the licence revenue on the basis set out above.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,18th February, 1954.APPENDIXFees  1 (sound),  3 (T.V.)Number of licences at f soundend of year \ T.V.Gross licence revenuePost Office expensesExchequer    ...New T.V.
