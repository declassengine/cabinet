(&apos;fHlSjpCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET,   . CABINET OFFICE InRECORD COPY       COPY NO-A?-24TH FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETTELEVISION FILM PROGRAMMES:CONTROL OF FOREIGN MATERIALMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade  point of importance arises on clause 3(l)d of the television Bill which I feel should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.2. It is generally agreed that, unless we prevent them, theprogramme contractors will overload their programmes with cheap andpopular American films.    We are pledged to avert this.3. We can try to do this in one of two ways:-(i)  The Authority could be instructed to securethat as far as possible a proper (or predominant)proportion of British films is used.(ii)  The programmes could be subject to a statutory control by means of a quota system.Responsibility on the Authority4. This is the method relied upon in the present draft of the television Bill,    It would have certain advantages.    It is direct, simple,flexible, and leaves the programme contractors responsible to the Authorityalone.    On the other hand  -(i)  failure to impose a quota would invoke strong opposition from all sides of the film industry andthe Unions representing other branches of theentertainments industry;(ii)  the Authority would have great difficulty in holding balance between the Unions - who seek very severe restrictions on foreign films - and thebroadcasters, who would wish to use as manysuch films as possible;(iii)  if the Authority intended to make their controleffective they would have to face all theadministrative complications of a quota scheme without the statutory penalties available under such a scheme.
Board of Trade, S.W.I. ,24TH FEBRUARY, 1954.5. This would involve more complicated legislation.    It would impose certain administrative requirements on the programme contractors and make the Board of Trade responsible for the supervision of these requirements.    It might be unpopular, not only with the Americans, butalso with broadcasters because it would tend to increase the cost of their programmes;  and there might be complaints that sufficient British filmswere not available.6. The advantages of the quota method are that -(i)  it would meet the strong pressures.already being exerted for a statutory scheme fromthe Cinematograph Films Council, the filmproducers, and the Unions;(ii)  it seems likely to prove effective in protecting the nascent British television film industry.Such an industry might become quite animportant affair and it has useful exportpossibilities;(iii)  it is equally capable of flexibility;  the size and scope of the quota could, if need be, be changed every six months.The Choice7. Whichever method is adopted is likely to land us in difficulties. My advice is that we adopt the quota solution on the grounds that it is more likely to provide an effective scheme and is better devised to avoid difficulties with the film companies and the Unions.Possibility of a separate Quota Bill8. I have an open mind whether a quota scheme, if decided upon,should be embodied in the Television Bill or should be the subject of aseparate Bill, not necessarily in this Session.P.T0
