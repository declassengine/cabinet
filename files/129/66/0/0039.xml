CONFIDENTIAL,cabinet OFFICEce(54) 89 RECORD COPY copy no.6TH march, 1954cabinetINDUSTRIAL ORGANISATION AND DEVELOPMENT bill memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Lord Privy Seal reported to the Cabinet on 3rd february the difficulties which have arisen over the Industrial Organisation andDevelopment Bill  (C0C0(54) 7th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. I would like to remind my colleagues of the circumstances inwhich this Bill was introduced.    The Labour Government established a development Council for the clothing industry by Order, under theIndustrial Organisation and Development Act, 1947, operating^on1st January, 1950.    This Development Council encountered strong opposition from the employers and proved a failure.    It was brought toan end by an Order operating on 1st January, 1953.    By agreementbetween the numerous Employers1 Associations and the principal TradeUnion^ it was replaced by a voluntary body representing both sides ofindustry - the Joint Clothing Council. v3. The Joint Clothing Council drew up a useful programme of workwhich could only be financed in the long run by a levy on the clothingindustry.   The more useful features of the programme fell under the heading of activities connected with productivity which went beyond thepurposes for which levies can be raised under Section 9 of the 1947 Act.The Joint Clothing Council therefore requested that steps should be takento widen the scope of Section 9, and this was the reason for the present bill.    It seemed preferable to proceed by general legislation rather thanby legislation confined to the clothing industry, as it was thought that other industries might lodge a similar request.    The Section of the Billempowering the raising of a levy was purely permissive;  it was not theintention to act on it except at the request of the industry concerned.4. Since the Bill was introduced, there have been twodevelopments J-(i)  The Bill has encountered severe opposition from government supporters who are opposed to any -extension of the principle of a compulsory levy on an industry, even at the industry s request.Soundings which have been made of the employers&apos;organisations show that the Bill has few friends, inits present form.
7q(ii)  The Joint Clothing Councils- no doubt affected bythe general attitude of industry towards the bills has now formally requested me to deferaction on the grounds that they do not regard the present draft of the Bill as satisfactory,,and they wish to give, further consideration toits implications.5. The problem of the future of the Joint Clothing Council must be deferred until they have reached a greater measure of agreement among themselves^,    I attach some importance to the continuance of this Council,or something like it;  this view is shared by the more responsibleelements in all the Employers&apos; Associations, as well as by the TradeUnion side.    It is possible that in due course the Joint Clothing council may renew their request for something on the lines of the present bill as the only means of financing their programme.    In view of theopposition to the recent Bill such a measure would probably have to bein the form of a special Bill for the clothing industry.6. In these circumstances it is clear that the Government cannotproceed with the present Bill:  there are then two courses open to us:(1)  To withdraw the Bill, or(2)  To defer any action on it and simply allow itto fall with any other uncompleted businessat the end of the Session.7. If we decide to withdraw the Bill we can do so upon the generalground that those who urged us to introduce it are not satisfied with itin its present form;  but we shall not come out of the operation entirelyunscathed.8. If we defer action on the Bill we can say that this is what the clothing industry who asked for the Bill invite us to do.    The difficultyof this course arises from the fact that, knowing the Bill is opposed by our own back-benchers, the Opposition may actively press the Leader ofthe House for information as to what we intend to do about ite9. I think that the arguments for either course are nicelybalanced and that we should be largely guided by the Leader of the house in this matter.    For my own part I am inclined to the view that we wouldbe wise to defer any action on the Bill for the time being and that the leader of the House should say that he understands discussions are proceeding with the industrial interests concerned.PaT.Board of Trade, S.W01.,5TH MARCH, 1954.
