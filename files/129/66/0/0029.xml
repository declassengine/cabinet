secret. (54) 7927th February, 1954MANUFACTURE OF CIVIL AIRCRAFT IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsUntil the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) Treaty and the bonn conventions come into force, the Germans cannot own or operate aircraft, andthe manufacture of aircraft or their components in Germany requires the approvalof the Allied Military Security Board. The latter have in practice permitted themanufacture only of minor components required by North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.) countries. When the E.D.C. Treaty is in force germany will not be able to have national armed forces or an independent armaments industry. She will have a contingent in the European air force, but the manu-facture in Germany of military aircraft and certain major components thereof will,under the terms of the Treaty, be permitted only with the unanimous consent ofthe other members of the E.D.C.2. The E.D.C. Treaty, therefore, provides for strict control over Germanuse of military aircraft and could, in theory, prevent altogether their productionin the Federal Republic. These provisions of the Treaty also protect us to aconsiderable extent against revival, in civilian guise, of a German military aircraft industry because such a clandestine act would be a breach of the E.D.C. Treaty;and even if military aircraft were manufactured in secret, the Germans could not use them without obtaining the consent of the E.D.C. In any case it is muchmore difficult now than it was in the 1930s to switch from civil to military aircraft production or to manufacture &quot;common use&quot; types of aircraft. Despite thesestrong safeguards against its use for military purposes, we should prefer not tosee a German civil aircraft industry emerge, both because it would be to someextent a potential military danger and also because it would compete directly withour own industry. It was not possible to obtain, in the E.D.C. Treaty and theBonn Conventions, strong safeguards against a German civil aircraft industry.In a letter of 27th May, 1952 to the three Foreign Ministers, however, the federal chancellor stated that Germany, having no aircraft industry, intended topurchase from other countries such civil aircraft as she might need; and he under -took that, if this situation should change, the Federal Republic would seek agreement on the matter with the Three Powers.3. Such a vague undertaking does not provide a serious legal deterrent tothe establishment of a civil aircraft industry in Germany. Nevertheless, we have so far acted on the assumption that this industry will not revive and british manufacturers have, through the Ministry of Supply, been strictly forbidden from entering into even the most tentative discussions with potential German manu-facturers. Unfortunately we have been alone in pursuing this policy, and theposition now is that(a) Certain German officials and industrialists are planning for the revival of the German civil aircraft industry. They hope to start by manu-facturing foreign aircraft and components under licence, and havebeen encouraged by some foreign manufacturers, particularly the americans.(b) Once the Bonn Conventions are in force, the Germans will be permitted to start a civil airline again. British and American manufacturers arecompeting for the contract to equip this new Lufthansa. We are particularly anxious for our manufacturers to get the order because we shall be very short of Deutschemarks with which to pay for our troops in Germany in the post-occupation period.45762CABINET OFFICE Copy No. 7RECORD COPYCABINETPrinted for the Cabinet.

2(c) British manufacturers are complaining that the restrictions placed on theircontacts with potential German manufacturers place them at a dis--i - : advantage (compared to the Americans) in their efforts to sell toLufthansa. These complaints have been borne out by the fact thatwhen the Germans placed their first provisional order recently it was for eight United States aircraft. We have been reliably informed that,with a view to obtaining this order, the United States manufacturersoffered to license the production in Germany of component parts ofthe aircraft concerned. This offer may have turned the scale in favourof the American types.4. In these circumstances, our present policy, pursued in isolation, will give us the worst of both worlds. In the short run it will severely handicap ourmanufacturers in getting orders to equip the new Lufthansa. In the longer termour present policy will not prevent the revival of a German civil aircraft industry,but it may hinder this, thereby perhaps harming our relations with the GermanGovernment to no good purpose, and it would certainly throw any embryoGerman aircraft industry into the arms of United States firms. This would be undesirable because, if there is to be a German civil aircraft industry, it is in our interest that it should initially build British rather than American types of aircraft and should develop close ties with British industry, thus giving us the advantageof an eye on the Germans from the inside.5.   There are in theory two alternative courses:  (a) to take up the whole question of a future German civil aircraft industry with the French and Americans with the object of agreeing a firmAllied front against it; or(b) to allow United Kingdom manufacturers more latitude in their contacts with potential German manufacturers, so that they can safeguard their position if the German industry is eventually revived.6. The only course which might ensure that a German civil aircraft industry would not emerge is (a). Ideally, therefore, it is the better and is the one which our manufacturers would prefer. But the difficulty is that there is no chance of persuading the Americans to form a solid front with us. It is unlikely that weshould obtain the agreement even of the State Department, who would probablyargue that, while they agreed about the formal position as set forth in the FederalChancellors letter of 27th May, 1952, they could not advise United States manu-facturers to desist from making tentative arrangements with potential Germanmanufacturers which would remain subject to the entry into force of the bonn conventions and the E.D.C. Treaty and to any other relevant inter-governmentalagreements. Even in the unlikely event of the State Department reaching anagreement with us, all experience suggests that they would be unable to makethe United States manufacturers abide by its terms. The result might be to put the British aircraft industry under an even greater handicap in relation to theirAmerican competitors than they are at present.7. Course (b) therefore appears to be the only practical one. This coursewould not anticipate the setting up of the E.D.C., because British manufacturers would still not be permitted to enter into contracts for the manufacture of their aircraft in Germany. Nor would it mean throwing away whatever safeguard theFederal Chancellor^ letter may give us against a revival of the German civil aircraft industry. All that is suggested is that our manufacturers should no longer be asked to eschew all contacts with the Germans. To give them this limitedfreedom would do no more than enable them to safeguard their position to someextent, in case, as we fear,.it proves impossible to prevent the emergence of aGerman civil aircraft industry in due course. Unless we can assure our manufac-turers of our ability to prevent this development which, for the reasons given above, we cannot this seems the least concession which we could reasonably make.8. I therefore recommend that my colleagues should agree to allow UnitedKingdom manufacturers sufficient latitude in their contacts with potential Germanmanufacturers to safeguard their position if the German civil aircraft industryis eventually revived. .\   \ .. .       .
