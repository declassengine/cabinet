Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1954SECRETC. (54) 78 CABINET OFFICE . Copy No.26th February, 1954 RECORD COPYCABINETRATING AND VALUATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Valuation for Rating Bill, dealing with the assessment of dwelling-houses for the revaluation, was introduced and passed last Session. The proposedprovisions dealing with the rating of Gas Boards, as well as provisions forsimplifying procedure for bringing the new lists into force, and effecting certain other improvements in rating law (approved generally at a meeting of the Cabineton 5th February, 1953 (C.C. (53) 7th Conclusions, Minute 3)) were held over tillsome later Session.2. The new valuation lists are due to come into force on 1st April, 1955.This date is fixed by an Order made under the New Valuation Lists (Postponement)Act, 1953, which allows the making of Orders postponing the revaluation. these orders have merely to be laid, and are not subject to affirmative or negative resolu-tion. The staff of the Valuation Office have been working to this date, and as aresult of great efforts on their part the new lists could be ready in time; but theChancellor and I have agreed that the date ought to be put off till 1st April, 1956.3. In order that rating authorities and the Inland Revenue valuation officersmay know where they stand, the necessary Order must be made very soon, and simultaneously a public announcement of the decision should be made, by way ofa reply to a Question in Parliament. The reply would explain that the government consider it essential, before the new lists are brought into force, to effect certainimprovements in the existing law and statutory procedure to make it both moreworkable and more comprehensible to rate-payers. These improvements will include simplification of the procedure for appealing against assessments, and theprovision of a new method of assessing gas undertakings. The reply would end by saying that it is not possible to pass the necessary Bill this Session and that anOrder had accordingly been made postponing the revaluation till 1st April, 1956.4. The most important provision needed, apart from those to be mentionedin the statement, is the abolition of the public deposit of the valuation list before it conies into force. Most assessments are bound to rise, but rate poundagesshould fall proportionately. If rate-payers know what their new assessment isbefore they receive the demand note for the rate and find out what is the actualamount that they have to pay, they will all tend to be alarmed and inclined to appeal against the new assessments, even those who will eventually have to pay lessin rates. The amendment will provide that the rating authorities will be given the lists by the end of the December preceding the April in which the new lists are totake effect, to enable them to calculate the product of a penny rate for the countyprecept, and to work out the rates for each rate-payer in time to issue the ratedemands on the 1st April. The ratepayers, however, will suffer nothing by losingthe right to appeal against the new assessments before 1st April, because the effectof any successful appeal made in the rate period beginning on 1st April will go back to that date. There are also a number of other improvements to rating law,45761
including the granting of power to, rating authorities to remit or reduce rates onpremises occupied by charitable or philanthropic bodies (which many, in effect, donow, by reducing the assessments, though without statutory authority), which Ithink it desirable to have included all together in a single Bill.5. If my colleagues approve these proposals, i will make the Order and thestatement in Parliament in the first week of March, and a Bill will be drafted for introduction at the beginning of the next Session.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,18th February, 1954.
