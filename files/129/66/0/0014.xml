-CfiET CABINET office.(54) 64 RECORD COPY copy no. i^j19th february, 1954cabinetROYAL TOUR OF UGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Queen is to open the Owen Falls Dam at the end of April.I have discussed with the Governor of Uganda whether thereshould be any change in the arrangements.    The present position asregards Buganda is that a case designed to test the legality of our action has been brought in the High Court of the Protectorate.    The disposal ofthis is likely to take a considerable time and the people of Buganda areawaiting the result.    There is thus no chance of a new Kabaka being elected before the Queen&apos;s visit.    Meanwhile, life in Buganda is proceed-ing quite normally and there has been no sort of disturbance.    Buganda is,of course, only one of the four Provinces of the Protectorate and the visitis to the Protectorate as a whole.2.        The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to arrive in Ugandaon the morning of 28th April, and to stay for three days until the late evening of 3 0th April.    The first day of the visit is to be spent entirely in thegrounds of Government House at Entebbe, with a ceremony of welcome andan investiture in the morning, to be attended by representatives from all parts of the Protectorate, and a garden party in the afternoon which is tobe similarly representative but a larger gathering.    The Queen is to spend the morning of the second day in Kampala, the main town of the country,and will present colours to the 4th Battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles.She will then drive round the town, and stop for ten minutes at variousplaces, including Mengo, the headquarters of the Buganda Government.In the afternoon of the second day the Queen will go to Jinja for the openingof the Owen Falls Dam.    She will spend the third day in the queen elizabeth National Park in the Western Province.    Both Entebbe andKampala are in Buganda.3.        On 6th January the Buganda Lukiko (Parliament) passed aresolution in respectful terms requesting that, if it should be possible,the Queen&apos;s visit to Buganda should be postponed at this time, on theground that with no Kabaka it would be difficult for the Baganda to givethe Queen a suitable welcome.    The resolution referred to the visit toBuganda, not Uganda, and was not the result of any popular demand;  itwas a political step designed to help secure the return of the Kabaka. -The resolution is known to have been directly inspired by the Bugandadeputation in London and indeed the actual text of it was brought back from London to Uganda by a member of the deputation.    There are knownto be very mixed feelings about the resolution among the Baganda and large numbers of them would be deeply disappointed if the Queen&apos;s visitdid not take place.-1-
4.       Apart from the Baganda, everyone in the Protectorate is looking forward to the visit with the greatest enthusiasm.    The Mukama (Ruler) ofToro came out strongly in this sense in his speech on the occasion of hisjubilee during January; the National Park which the Queen is to visit isin Toro,    The Prime Minister of Bunyoro has written to the Governmentdissociating Bunyoro from the Buganda resolution.    The same view is held in the other districts.    The Prime Minister of Buganda, who is the senior Regent, recently told the Resident, without any prompting from thelatter, that he was strongly in favour of the Queen&apos;s visit proceeding as arranged, except that the short visit to Mengo should be cut out.    He saidthat a number of members in discussion in the Lukiko had said that theyhad no desire that the Queen should not come to Entebbe or visit other places apart from Mengo.    All that had been agreed was that the Bagandathemselves would find it difficult to receive the Queen at Mengo without thepresence of the Kabaka.    Therefore, all the ceremonies at which theBaganda were not acting as hosts should go forward and invitations shouldbe sent to Buganda guests in the ordinary way.5.       The Governor discussed the matter immediately before his visit to London with his senior advisers, including the Commissioner of Police.He strongly recommends that the visit should go forward as planned, withthe short visit to Mengo cut out.    It is his view, and that of his advisers,that, although the Baganda have been deeply distressed by the depositionof the Kabaka, this will have no material effect on the security situation asfar as the Queen&apos;s visit is concerned.    He also considers that there is nolikelihood of embarrassing demonstrations during the visit or otherembarrassment to Her Majesty.    The Baganda are a courteous people whohave throughout behaved with dignity and restraint.    The Governor considersthat recent happenings will not affect the warmth of the welcome whichwill be given to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh by all sections of thecommunity.    It is possible that some of the Baganda may not take part,but the Governor thinks that the great majority will,6.       He has told me that the cancellation of the visit, apart from the deep disappointment which it would cause, would in his opinion have a veryadverse effect on the political situation;  if, on the other hand, the visittakes place, it would have a most salutary effect and would be just what the protectorate now needs.    But, in putting forward his recommendation thatthe visit should proceed, he has based himself not on this, but on considera-tions of security and the possibility of embarrassment to the Queen duringthe visit.    On these he has expressed his confidence that there is no reasonfor cancelling the visit.7.       I support the Governor&apos;s advice and, subject to the views of mycolleagues, propose to advise Her Majesty accordingly.    Should Her Majestyaccept this advice, I am anxious, in view of local uncertainties/ to have it made known publicly as soon as possible that the Queen&apos;s visit will proceed as planned subject to the one minor change suggested above.    It will inany case be necessary, when the Governor returns to Uganda, for a replyto be made to the Lukiko resolution referred to in paragraph 3 above,    I am quite sure that such an announcement would have a most beneficial effect in Uganda,O.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.18TH FEBRUARY, 1954.
