The Bill has been examined by the Committee on television development under the chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, and thepresent draft embodies a number of important policy decisions reached by that Committee.    In view of the extreme tightness of the time-table,the Committee asked me to present the Bill direct to the Cabinet,instead of submitting it first to the Legislation Committee.2.        Annex 1 gives an outline of the policy embodied in the Bill,drawing attention to some points that need special consideration.    Forthe convenience of my colleagues a second Annex is also attachedsummarising the provisions of the main clauses of the Bill,3.        During the consideration of the Bill by the Committee, informal soundings were taken of some critics of the plan as presented toParliament in the debates towards the end of last year.    The mostimportant change proposed in that plan results from a strong recommenda-tion that the revenue of the new Authority should not be entirely dependenton advertisements.    I have made proposals on this subject in C, (54) 65about wireless licence fees.4.        Our aim is that the new television service should be on the airby the summer of 1955.    This might just be possible if the Bill is passed through all its stages and the Authority set up by the Summer Recess.Even so, the time available will be extremely short for the Authority tosettle and carry out its plans, and in particular to undertake and complete negotiations with the programme contractors and arrange forthe provision of new T. V. stations.    Nor will the programme contractorshave much time to negotiate contracts with the Authority, make arrange-ments for finance and prepare a series of programmes to &quot;get started&quot;.5.       The Bill is certain to need considerable discussion and debate in both Houses of Parliament and since a great deal of interest is takenin the subject by influential members of the House of Lords, time will be needed for consideration by the House of Commons of amendments to theBill in the Upper House, and this certainly leaves us with a very closetime-table.;   D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.23rd february, 1954
ANNEX 1TELEVISION BILLGeneral CommentsThe Bill lays down the general policy which the new Authority isto follow in the operation of its services.    Within this general policy, itis the intention that the Authority should manage its own affairs; andthat the Government should not have any general powers of direction butonly such specific powers as are required to honour its public undertakings.2.        With this Bill we are entering into an area hitherto unexploredin this country and the provisions of the Bill must necessarily be broadand flexible.    The success of the plan obviously depends on its attractionto potential programme contractors, and while certain preliminary discussions have taken place with parties who might be interested in thenew scheme, they clearly cannot commit themselves until they can sizeup the opportunities available to them.    All that can be said at present is that the position is reasonably promising, as a number of influentialgroups from the entertainment industry and the Press are taking great interest in the possibilities.    This is encouraging from the point ofview of our policy that there should be competition between programme contractors, for which there is specific provision in the Bill (Clause 5 (2)).Until the Authority is established, however, and has worked out an actualscheme for the provision of service by different programme contractors,it is difficult to say how the plan will develop.3.        The fact that only broad guidance on policy is given to theAuthority in the Bill can be illustrated at many points.    Mention shouldbe made of one point in particular, namely, the responsibility placed onthe Authority by Clause 3(l)(d) to ensure that a proper proportion offilms and other recorded matter is of British origin.    A scheme forGovernment control was canvassed in the joint paper by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and myself (C. (54) 2).    The question has since been considered by the Committee on Television Development who agreedthat this matter could best be dealt with on the broad lines adopted in clause 3 (l)(d).    1 understand, however, that the President is concerned about the situation, and that he proposes to circulate a paper to theCabinet.    The matter is clearly important, in view of the Governmentspledge to preserve the British character of the programmes and toprotect the interests of our artistes and producers.4.        The ultimate sanction for ensuring that the general policyembodied in the Bill is carried out by the Authority lies in the powergiven to the Postmaster-General in Clause 1(4) to terminate the appoint-ment of any member of the Authority.    The other final sanction - whichis vested in the Authority itself - is the power under Clause 5(5) to terminate or suspend contracts with programme contractors.    the solicitor-General considers that this power, standing alone, is sodrastic that it might deter prospective programme contractors from taking on the heavy risk of coming into the scheme, and he has accordingly suggested an expansion of Clause 5(4) to provide in the contracts formonetary penalties to be imposed on programme contractors.    This isproposed as a half-way house but I feel that it might equally well beregarded as adding further sanctions and may therefore have an oppositeeffect to that intended.    Apart from the sanctions referred to above, thereis no machinery provided in the Bill for the enforcement of specificprovisions - this point has been brought specially to the notice of theLord Chancellor and the Law Officers.
115.        The Bill lays down in Clause 2(2) that the programmes shouldbe provided by programme contractors and not, save in certain specifiedexceptional cases, by the Authority itself.    Clause 8 provides for an income to the Authority, independent of advertisements, in the form ofa grant not exceeding  750,000 in any financial year; and Clause 9 for capital borrowing by the Authority from the Exchequer of up to 2 millions in the first five yearsi6.        The following is a summary of the powers of direction reserved to the Government in fulfilment of specific pledges given during theearlier debates.(a) Advertisements.    The code summarised in the second schedule can only be amended by statutory instrument laidbefore both Houses of Parliament, which will be subjectto affirmative resolution.    The Postmaster-General may(Clause 4(5)) give directions regarding classes anddescriptions of goods and services not to be advertisedand methods of advertising not to be employed, and may also fix (Second Schedule, paragraph 3) rules regardingthe intervals between periods of advertisements and between advertisements and special types of broadcasts,e. g. broadcasts of Royal occasions.(b) Public ceremonies and sporting events.    The Postmaster-General may determine the important public and sportingevents for which the Authority must ensure that broad-casts only take place if, in its opinion, reasonablefacilities on reasonable terms are available from allbroadcasting stations, including those of the B.B.C.(Clause 5(2)).(c) Broadcasts of particular items. Clause 6(1) and (2)gives the Government power to require the Authorityto broadcast any specified matter or to refrain frombroadcasting any specified matter.(d) Hours of broadcasting.    The Postmaster-General may give directions regarding the maximum and minimumtime for broadcasts by the Authority&apos;s services(Clause 6 (3)).(e) Coverage.    The Postmaster-General may direct the Authority to improve the strength of its broadcasttransmissions or arrange for broadcasts fromadditional stations (Clause 6(4)).7.       As regards finance and accounts, the Bill gives the Postmaster-General power to obtain information from the Authority regarding itsplans, and also forecasts, estimates, information and documents inrespect of the financial transactions and engagements of theAuthority (Clause 12(4) and (5)).8.        The Committee on Television Development considered thatthe powers listed in paragraphs 6 and 7 were the minimum that mustbe reserved to the Government.    There may well be pressure, however,for closer Government control when the Bill is before Parliament^and there are two directions in particular in which we may be obliged
73to yield.    One is whether the Bill should provide that the terms,conditions and periods, of the contracts between the Authority and programmcontractors should be &quot;laid down on behalf of the Postmaster-General&quot;according to the undertaking given in the House of Lords (Hansard,25th November, 1953, Column 529).    These contracts are obviously ofthe first importance to the plan as a whole.    The other is whether theBill should provide for a right of appeal to the Postmaster-Generalbefore a contract with a programme contractor is terminated orsuspended by the Authority (Clause 5(5)).    The Committee thought that -at this stage at any rate - the Bill should not include specific provisions to cover either of these points.9.       A further point to which special attention should be drawn is that ofcontrol of programme contractors by foreign interests.    Clause 5(l)(i)provides that a person who is not a British subject ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man should be adisqualified person for the purpose of this Clause.    The Committee on television Development agreed that the British qualification must stand -this will be in Tine with practice in other countries, e. g. Australia andthe United States;  on the other hand it must be recognised that to disqualifypersons who are not British subjects may encourage foreign countries to take retaliatory steps against British subjects in other commercialspheres.
ANNEX 2TELEVISION BILLComments on Individual ClausesClause 1This provides for the appointment of members of the Authorityby the Postmaster-General and the conditions on which such appointmentswill be held.    Points of particular importance are:-Subsection (1).    The Authority will be set up, in accordancewith the White Paper (Command 9005), for a period of tenyears, and continuation will require a new Act.    The presentB,B. C. Charter expires in 1962 and the ten-year period forthe Authority (expiring in 1964) fits in conveniently.Subsection (4)  gives the Postmaster-General power todetermine at any time the appointment of any member of theAuthority.Subsection (6) places on the Postmaster-General theresponsibility for satisfying himself that members of theAuthority have no interest prejudicial to their functions as such.Clause 2This gives the Authority power to do everything required for theproper discharge of its functions as described in Clause 1.Subsection (2) makes it clear that the programmes broad-cast by the Authority will normally be provided by programme contractors, but gives the Authority itself power to provideprogrammes or parts of programmes in certain definedcircumstances.    These special arrangements have theircorollary in the grant of funds to the Authority - independent of advertisements - within a limit of  750,000 a year(Clause 8).Clause 3This gives the Authority directions regarding the programmesbroadcast through its services. Particular mention should be made ofthe following points:-Subsection (l)(d) places on the Authority itself responsibility-responsibility for ensuring that a proper proportion of filmsandother recorded matter is of British origin.    The need for ensuring that the programmes are predominantly British hasbeen accepted in the public undertakings given and hasbeen strongly urged by &quot;Equity&quot; and other associations.Subsection (l) Proviso (i) permits Party political broad-casts of the B.B.C. to be relayed by the Authority.    TheAuthority is not obliged to take them, but if it does itmust relay them in full.
Subsection (3) requires the Authority to set up a ReligiousAdvisory Committee (on the lines of the Committee whichadvises the B. B. C.) and enables it to appoint advisorycommittees on other subjects.Clause 4This, together with the Second Schedule, provides for theinclusion of advertisements in the Authority1 s broadcasts and theconditions governing such advertisements.Subsection (l) enables the Authority to accept payment for advertisements broadcast with programmes whichit itself provides.Subsection (4) gives the Postmaster-General the powerto vary by Statutory Instrument the advertisement codein the Second Schedule.goSubsection (5) gives the Postmaster-General power todecide classes and descriptions of goods or services which must not be advertised, and methods of advertisingwhich must not be employed.Clause 5This contains a number of important provisions regarding the contracts for the programmes.Subsection (l) defines persons or bodies corporate whoare disqualified from holding a controlling position inrespect of the programme contractors.Subsection (2) requires the Authority to do all it can tosecure adequate competition between programme contractorsindependent of each other both as to finance and control,and lays on the Postmaster-General and the Authority-special responsibilities to ensure that there is no monopolyin the broadcasting of important public and sporting events.Subsection (4) and the Third Schedule give general directions to the Authority regarding the provisions to be included in contracts between the Authority and the programme contractors, and provides for monetary penalties to be imposed on the latter for minor breaches of theircontract.Subsection (5) gives the Authority an absolute right to terminate or suspend a contract with a programmecontractor (with no entitlement to compensation) in theevent of a breach by the programme contractor of its obligations under the Act or its contract with theAuthority.Clause 6This specifies particular matters in respect of which the Govern-ment will have control over the Authority.    They comprise a direction to broadcast (or refrain from broadcasting) specified items (Subsections(l) and (2)), directions as to the maximum and minimum time given lo
broadcasts by the Authority&apos;s services (Subsection (3)), and directions as to the extension of the coverage of the Authority&apos;s services (Sub-section (4)).Clause 7The principle laid down for the financial policy of the authority is that their revenues should be sufficient to meet all sums properlychargeable to Revenue Account (including repayment of loans and interest,depreciation, and establishment and maintenance of a reserve), and tomake proper provision for capital expenditure.Clause 8This enables the Postmaster-General to grant to the Authoritya sum not exceeding  750,000 a year.Clause 9This enables the Authority to receive financial assistance fromthe Exchequer by means of borrowing, in order to defray initial expenses and cover expenditure properly chargeable to capital account.    Theamount that can be borrowed in this way is limited to  1 million in thefirst year and not more than  2 millions within a period of five years from the establishment of the Authority.    Annual accounts will beprepared (Subsection (4)) by the Postmaster-General in respect of sumsborrowed in this way and these accounts will be submitted to the comptroller and Auditor-General and laid before Parliament.Clause 10This gives the Postmaster-General, with the approval of theTreasury, power to decide, after consultation with the Authority, howrevenue in excess of the sums properly chargeable to Revenue account and credited to the Reserve Fund should be applied.Clause 11This provides for the establishment and maintenance of aReserve Fund and gives the Postmaster-General, with the approval of theTreasury, power to give the Authority directions relating to theestablishment or management of the Fund.Clause 12This deals with the accounts and records to be maintained bythe Authority; the Auditors will be appointed by the Authority with theapproval of the Postmaster-Generals    Under Subsection (3) the authority will prepare an Annual Report and the Postmaster-General will havepower (Subsection (4)) to give directions to the Authority regardinginformation about plans and past and present activities, to be included.Under Subsection (5) the Postmaster-General has power to have the accounts examined on his behalf and to require the Authority to furnishforecasts, estimates, information and documents in respect of thefinancial transactions and engagements of the Authority.Clause 13This provides that the Authority should consult with appropriateorganisations for the establishment and maintenance of machinery for settling terms and conditions of employment of the staff of the Authority
(including arbitration in the event of disputes) and for the promotion and encouragement of measures affecting the safety, health and welfare of theAuthority&apos;s employees.    The clause follows the line of similar clauses in Nationalisation Acts.Clause 14This provides that the conditions of employment of people in theservice of programme contractors should be not less favourable thanthose prescribed in the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons,and also for the reference, by the Minister of Labour and NationalService, to arbitration of disputes in respect of such conditions.Clause 15This enables expenses incurred by the Postmaster-General forthe purpose of the Act to be defrayed from monies provided by Parliament.Clause 16This is the interpretation clause.Clause 17This defines the application of the Act and provides for its extension by Order in Council, with such adaptations and modifications as are necessary, to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
