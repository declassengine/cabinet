It is clear from our examination that it is not possible to deviseany plan which would have any advantage for Civil Defence commensurate with the disadvantages to the Service Departments.3.        We have, therefore, thought it right to re-examine the proposal,referred to in the memorandum by the Minister of Labour (C0 (53) 222)which the Cabinet had before it on 10th August, 1953, to make use ofR.A.F, National Service reservists temporarily surplus to mobilisationrequirements.    Circumstances have altered since last August, becausethe legislation affecting the Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves has nowbeen passed, and from the discussions which took place on that legislation it seems probable that any proposal which would employ National Servicereservists who are not required for the Services in the first year ofmobilisation and are therefore unlikely to be called up for part-timetraining would be acceptable to Parliament.     Morecver8 it has proved possible on further examination to make some important changes in that proposal.    We accordingly now submit for the approval of the Cabinet a revised scheme as described in the following paragraphs.    It is important to emphasise that, although so far as can be seen at present it is onlyreservists of the Royal Air Force who would be affected, any scheme mustbe drafted and announced in general terms as applicable to all three services.4.        The main principle of the revised scheme is that the NationalService reservists included in the scheme would, in peace and war, remainmembers of the Armed Forces.    In peace they would be trained by civil defence instructors (probably at Civil Defence establishments) and in warthey would be mobilised by the Service Departments and employed in service formations but they would be placed at the disposal of theGovernment for Civil Defence duties.    They would be fox&apos;med into mobilecolumns which would be sited near the most vulnerable target areas,5.        Training would be given for one fortnight in each of twoconsecutive years of part-time service;  it would consist of such individualtraining as could be given within that limited period;  separate arrange-ments would have to be organised for training the comparatively smallrequirement of officers and non-commissioned officers.    The trainingdepots would require to be sited and organised so as to serve in war asSECRETC0(54)/6719TH FEBRUARY^ 1954CABINETCIVIL DEFENCE manpower memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Minister for Welsh Affairs and the Minister of Defence -In pursuance of C.C. (53) 48th Conclusions, Minute 7, we have examined, in consultation with the Service Ministers, the practicability of giving some civil defence training to National Service men in the courseof their two years1 service.
mobilisation and operational headquarters and would have to be supplemented by additional centres for these purposes.    The home departments would be responsible for arranging for the provision of thesedepots and the Service Departments for directing the reservists to them fortraining in peace and calling them up in war; the reservists would bemobilised in operational units with an appropriate establishment ofofficers and non-commissioned officers to be agreed between the service departments and the Home Departments and to be found by the former.The reservists would wear Service uniform (possibly with a Civil Defencearm band or other distinguishing mark) and would not carry arms,    Onthe best estimate which can at present be made, approximately 15,000 men could be made available for training in the first year of the scheme and ineach subsequent year approximately 30,000.    On the basis of these figuresthe Home Departments would need to provide two new training depots inthe first year and three in the second year.    It is estimated that thiswould entail an additional capital expenditure in the first year of the orderof  70,000 and in the second year of  130s000 and an additional annualrevenue expenditure of about  425,000 in the first year, rising to about 850,000 in the second and subsequent years.6.        This scheme would not be appropriate in all respects to the fire Service.    The necessary modifications to the scheme would therefore have to be agreed between the Service Departments and the Home Depart-ments.7.        The cost of the scheme in peace or in war wouldr. in principle,be borne by the Home Departments, but it would no doubt be found con-venient that in some respects the cost should initially be borne by theService Departments and recovered from the Home Departments.8.        The scheme would enable the reservists to be called out for home defence against actual or apprehended attack and would ensure asubstantial reserve, partly trained in peace, which could be quicklymobilised,9.        Legislation is necessary to implement this scheme, although the precise scope and form of the legislation has not yet been worked out.In order to avoid delay in bringing the scheme into force it would benecessary for certain administrative action (the selection and conversionof suitable establishments for the depots, the recruitment of staff, and thetraining of instructors) to be authorised in advance of the legislation.The object would be to bring the scheme into operation in the spring of1955 and for this purpose it will be necessary for the legislation to be passed not later than July of this year.10.      We submit to the Cabinet the following re commendations s-(a) that the scheme described in the foregoing paragraphsbe approved in principle;(b) that immediate authority be given for the preparationof legislation and the initiation of preparatoryadministrative action;(c) that an announcement in general terms of theGovernment&apos;s decision should be made in theforthcoming Defence Debate.D.M.F., a.19TH FEBRUARY, 1954.
