(54) 7425th February, 1954EGYPTMemorandum by the Chiefs of StaffIntroductionAt their meeting on 10th February, 1954 the Cabinet considered a memoran-dum by the Lord Chancellor (C. (54) 45) on a possible alternative course of actionto be pursued in the event of a breakdown in the defence negotiations with Egypt.The Cabinet gave instructions that this alternative course, involving the winding up of the base and the reduction of British forces broadly to Treaty limits within two years, should be further examined and a timetable of military action prepared.(C.C. (54) 8th Conclusion, Minute 6.)2. After consultation with representatives of the Commanders-in-Chief,Middle East, we have prepared an outline plan, showing the sequence of militarymovements involved.The Plan3. The first step in the Plan is the withdrawal from the Tel El Kebir salient;this is followed by a progressive rolling up from the south until, at the end of twoyears, the final garrison is concentrated in an area about Ismailia and Abu Sueirwith its Line of Communication north to Port Said.The Plan involves the movement or disposal of over half a million tons of stores, some 26,000 vehicles, and valuable heavy machine tools, locomotives, craft and equipment.4.   The Plan is divided into four phases:  Phase I. During the first six months, the winding-up of Tel El Kebirdepot and withdrawal from Tel El Kebir.Phase II. During the second six months, evacuation of installations inthe Suez area.Phase III. During the third six months, evacuation of the Fayid-BitterLakes area.Phase IV. During the final six months, the withdrawal of the finalgarrison into the area Abu Sueir/Ismailia, with Line of Com-munication through Port Said.5. At Annex I is a map indicating the phased withdrawal of fighting troops.At Annex II is a table showing the summary of the movement of British personnel from the Canal Zone. At Annex III is the outline plan.Security of Final Garrison6. The final garrison will consist of a Division of two Brigade Groups,making some 10,000 armed British soldiers of whom 8,000 would be in combatunits and 2,000 in administrative units, together with some 3,000 Royal Air Force,all disposed in the Abu Sueir/Ismailia area. We must, however, be assured thatwe can maintain and supply this force through Port Said; we cannot risk its being placed in a position similar to our forces in Berlin.   We must, therefore, retain45749 bCAB!Nv7r office record copy cabinet
2an additional Infantry Brigade some 4,000 strong, to secure Port Said and tocontrol the Line of Communication between Port Said and Ismailia. Beforewithdrawing that Brigade and reducing the strength of the Army to 10,000, wewould have to be certain that there was no risk of Egyptian,action against our line of Communication. Unless there is a fundamental change in the attitudeof the Egyptians, it will be necessary to retain this additional brigade for theprotection of the Line of Communication until final evacuation of the Canal Zonetakes place.7. The plan and timetable are based on the assumption that the Egyptianswill co-operate. It is quite uncertain whether we shall get their co-operation;indeed it is possible that, as our forces are withdrawn, the Egyptians will deny useven the facilities which they now provide. Any increase in Egyptian guerillaactivity would slow down the process of withdrawal. If they engage in full-scaleguerilla Operations, it would be necessary to put into effect some or all of themeasures necessary to maintain our position in the Canal Zone (D. (53) 25) andto regain control before continuing the withdrawal. At any stage of the with-drawal, any overt military attack on our forces or attempt to interrupt our with-drawal would be an act of war. The plan, therefore, provides for the retention of adequate fighting troops with air support and for reinforcement at all stages.8. Amongst the measures which we might have to take to maintain our security are the imposition of military government in the area and the taking over of the operation of the Egyptian railways. This would probably involve calling upmembers of the Army Emergency Reserve.Military Implications9. From the beginning of Phase III, when we give up our oil storage atFanara, we shall have to be assured of a supply of oil from stocks at Port Said.This control may present difficulties because international safety rules prohibit the storage and handling of white oils at Port Said.10. After Phase I we shall no longer have the resources to carry out a full-scale operation in the Delta. On the other hand, as long as any British forcesremain in the Canal Zone, they must be prepared to carry out an emergency opera-tion to assist British subjects in the Delta, if their lives are threatened. an operation of this sort will require air support from outside Egypt and reinforce-ment of the garrison.11. After the evacuation of the Suez area in Phase II, we shall no longer beable at will to stop the flow through the Suez-Agrud oil pipe line and thus tocontrol the supplies of white oil on which the life of the Delta depends.12.   Once the evacuation of the Suez area has begun in Phase II, we shall nolonger have the power to ensure the free passage of shipping through the Canal. ,13.   As the withdrawal progresses, our ability to carry out our commitmentsunder the Anglo-Jordan Treaty will require reconsideration.14. The mounting of this operation wili entail additional expenditure whichis not provided for in current plans. The retention of a garrison in the Canal Zoneafter the completion of the operation will also involve extra cost; and will delay the planned run-down of the Army and the building up of the strategic reserve inthe United Kingdom.Conclusion  j15. We consider this plan to be the best that can be devised to implement theinstructions of the Cabinet but its successful execution wiU depend upon the degreeof co-operation given by the Egyptians. The latter will affect the smoothness withwhich the plan can be carried out, the extent to which we shall succeed in evacuat-ing the contents of the base and the cost. Since the retention of a &quot;TreatyGarrison&quot; in the Canal Zone will create a complete hostage to fortune and willhave an adverse effect on the planned run-down of the Army, we most strongly recommend that its withdrawal shall follow on the completion of the operationsnow planned.(Signed)        R. McGRIGOR.j. HARDING.W. F. DICKINSON.

ANNEX IIIOutline Plan for the Reduction of Forces in EgyptIntroduction&apos; &apos; il. This Plan provides for the evacuation of British Forces from the canal zone should it be found impracticable to reach a defence agreement with Egypt.Scope - .    -    , ..: s t ,v . &apos;2.   The Plan is in two Parts: -(a) Part /. The evacuation of the Base, the reduction of the garrison to10,000 Army and some 3,000 R.A.F. personnel, excluding essentialv troops for the protection and maintenance of the Lines of Communica-tion, and the withdrawal to near Treaty limits. This part of the plan is to be carried out over a period of two years.-; : (b) Part //-The evacuation of the final garrison from Egypt. The periodof time for which the final garrison will be retained in Egypt can onlybe decided by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the light of events at thetime.Assumptions on which the Plan is BasedPreliminary Warning3. In order to produce a detailed plan and to assemble the necessary shipping,it is assumed that a minimum period of two months&apos; notice will be given beforethe Plan has to be implemented;**** &apos;Specialist Reinforcements4. It is assumed that the Army Emergency Reserve can be called up toprovide the technical reinforcements which may be required.Redeployment, 5. Forces earmarked for redeployment in the Middle East will be withdrawn to the redeployment stations approved by Ministers (C.C. (54) 5th Conclusions,Minute 6). The remainder of the present garrison of the Canal Zone will bereturned to the United Kingdom.Capabilities of the Final Garrison: 6. The final garrison must be capable of a prolonged stay and of beingreinforced.Rate of Withdrawal of Stores and Plant\ iv; 7.   The rate of withdrawal of stores and plant assumes that:  (a) The present scale of provision of facilities by the Egyptians in the canal zone will continue.(b) The I necessary shipping will be provided.Disposal of Stores and Plant8: Priority of shipping will be given to the more valuable and importantstores and plant which can be moved and stored. Subject to security clearance,cheap, bulky or unserviceable stores will be sold locally or abandoned. special arrangements, including extra civilian man-power, will be necessary in the UnitedKingdom. :        vMajoi* Considerations Affecting the PlanEgyptian Co-operation9. The present degree of co-operation by the Egyptians is not freely givenbut is conditioned by the strength of our forces in Egypt. It is highly probable,therefore, that the provision of facilities which now exist will diminish as our
Suez Canal. 12. The success of the Plan depends on the uninterrupted use of the suez canal throughout its length for the whole period of withdrawal.Security of Water Supply13. The control of the bifurcation at Moascar of the Sweet Water Canalis the best method of minimising the possibility of the Egyptian authorities cutting off the supply of fresh water. ,     ,Maintenance of Oil Supplies in the Final Stages of the Withdrawal    &apos; c14. In the course of the withdrawal, all bulk tankage will be successivelyabandoned except for a single tank at Nefeisha which is insufficient for the require-ments of the final garrison. It will therefore, be essential to obtain the use, by force if necessary, of the civil tankage at Port Said before D -f-18 months:.   ,,15. It will also be essential to override the safety ban imposed by the suez canal Company on the storage and handling of white oils in Port Said.16. It will be essential to retain our oil tankage at Fanara until such time as pur full requirements can be met from Port Said.El Firdan Bridges mii   ;!17. Control of these bridges over the Suez Canal must be retained as longas there is any danger of intervention by the Egyptian Army from Sinai.Employment of the Strategic Reserve ,    &apos;^ &apos;18. It will be necessary to retain 3 Infantry division, the United\ KingdomStrategic Reserve,; in the Canal Zone until final evacuation. ;    .!, V.,forces are withdrawn. Any rise in Egyptian guerrilla activity would cause a slowing-down of the process of withdrawal. Should Egyptian hostility amountto full-scale guerrilla operations, some or all of the measures agreed to maintain our position in the Canal Zone (D. (53) 25) would have to be put into effect. Suchaction would be likely to lead to a spiral of events culminating in the necessity to impose military Government in part or all of the Canal Zone. At any stage of the evacuation, any overt military attack on our forces or attempt to interruptour withdrawal would be regarded as an act of war. The Plan, therefore, mustallow for the retention of adequate fighting troops together with airr offensivepotential, and for reinforcement, at all stages of the withdrawal. It must beemphasized, however, that since it is not possible to estimate any future degreeof Egyptian co-operation, the Plan has perforce to be based on the present scale of provision of facilities by the Egyptians in the Canal Zone. \Area to be Occupied by the Final Garrison \10. The area, with its essential Lines of Communication, must be capableof adequate defence and contain a port, oil storage, water and airfield facilities.Moascar-Abu Sueir with the Lines of Communication to Port Said, is the area which most nearly fulfils these conditions. Any attempt to disperse the, finalgarrison in a series of small isolated detachments throughout the length of the canal Zone for the purpose of protecting these facilities is militarily unsound and can only lead to disaster.Safeguarding the Lines of Communication11. Port Said and the Lines of Communication from the Moascar-AbuSueir area is vital for the evacuation of the Base, the maintenance of the filialgarrison and for the entry by sea of any necessary reinforcements. It is imperative that the defence of this Line of Communication and its operation in any circum-stances is ensured. It would not,&apos; therefore, be possible to withdraw the brigadeguarding this Line of Communication until such time as the security of the finalgarrison could otherwise be assured. Equally important will be the safeguarding of Abu Sueir airfield and its Lines of Communication to Moascar.       &apos;
Families , . ,   ,19. Under the conditions which are most likely to obtain it will be necessaryto evacuate families very shortly after the start of withdrawal. If conditions proveeasier than anticipated it may be possible to evacuate families with the troops asthey go. Families of the final garrison will in any event be evacuated before theend of the two-year withdrawal period.Outline PlanGeneral20. The Plan is based on closing down the Tel-el-Kebir salient and thenprogressively rolling up from the south until the position of the final garrison isreached at the end of two years. Royal Navy and Royal Air Force plans for theevacuation conform to the phasing of the Army withdrawal. It involves the sorting,packing, moving or disposal of some 600,000 tons of stores, 26,000 vehicles,2\ million jerricans and other miscellaneous heavy plant, craft, locomotives, wagons and equipment.PART IThis Part of the Plan will be carried out in four Phases (see Appendix C):  21.   Phase I.   D to D + 6 Months(a) Evacuation of Tel-el-Kebir Qassasin installations.(b) Army Reinforcements PlannedTwo infantry brigades to be sent by air in the event of operation RODEO being mounted.(c) Air Forces remaining in the Canal ZoneThree day-fighter/ground attack squadrons, two all-weatherfighter squadrons, one fighter reconnaissance squadron, one photoreconnaissance squadron, five medium-range transport squadrons.22.   Phase II.   D + 6 Months to D + 12 Months(a) Evacuation of installations in the Suez-Agrud-Adabya area.(b) One Commando Brigade moves to Malta (D + 6 months) and one infantry Brigade from Suez to Cyprus (D + 12 months), leavingfive infantry brigades in the Canal Zone.(c) Army Reinforcements PlannedOne Parachute Brigade group by air from the United Kingdom- and one Commando Brigade from Malta by sea.(d) Air Forces remaining in the Canal ZoneThree  day-fighter/ground   attack  squadrons,  one  fighterreconnaissance squadron, five medium-range transport squadrons.23.   Phase III.   D + 12 months to D + 1S months(a) Evacuation of Fayid-Fanara-Geneifa-Abu Sultan installations.(b) Joint Headquarters, Middle East, move to Cyprus.   Five infantry brigades remain in the Canal Zone.(c) Army Reinforcements PlannedOne Infantry Brigade by sea and air from Cyprus, one com-mando brigade by sea from Malta and one parachute brigade group&apos; by air from the United Kingdom.(d) Air Forces remaining in the Canal Zone(i) D + 12 months to D +15 monthsThree day fighter /ground attack squadrons, one fighter recon-naissance squadron, five medium range transport squadrons.(ii) D + 15 months to D + 18 monthsTwo day fighter/ground attack squadrons, one fighter recon-&apos;   :       1 naissance squadron.
H7,.   24.   P/zase /F.   D + 18 months to D + 24 months(a) Reduction to the final garrison area including Lines Of communication and Port Said.(b) Two infantry brigades and supporting troops move to the UnitedKingdom, Headquarters 1 Infantry Division move to Cyprus.(c) The final garrison will consist of:  -(i) Army (from 3 Infantry Division). A total of some 8,000divisional troops and some 2,000 administrative troops,including:  \ One divisional headquarters.Two brigade headquarters.Five infantry battalions. &apos;One armoured regiment.One armoured car regiment.One regiment Royal Horse Artillery.One light anti-aircraft regiment R.A.One field squadron R.E.In addition, there would be one infantry brigade, and ad-ministrative units, for the Lines of Communication and Port Said,totalling some 4,000 all ranks.   If this force were to be withdrawn,-a.. the security of the final garrison including its communications; could no longer be guaranteed without reinforcement.(ii) R.A.F. A total of some 3,000 all ranks, including:  Formation Headquarters.Two day fighter /ground attack squadrons.One fighter reconnaissance squadron.:r One communication flight.&apos;*;.) One air observation post flight.?v fs Two R.A.F. regiment field squadrons.One R.A.F. regiment light anti-aircraft wing.One staging post.One fighter control unit and signals unit.One airfield construction squadron.One equipment maintenance unit.in addition, there would be some 100 R.A.F. personnel forthe Lines of Communication.(d) Army Reinforcements Planned. As for paragraph 23 (c) above.25.   Air Reinforcements(a) Air reinforcements for RODEO will be available up to D + 3 months.(b) In an emergency, after D+15 months a further day fighter/groundattack squadron to be flown into Abu Sueir from elsewhere in theMiddle East.(c) It will also be possible, as a deterrent, to make arrangements for upto two squadrons of Canberra bombers to operate from Cyprus.PART IIEvacuation of the Final Garrison26. This will be a military operation requiring the pre-positioning of thenecessary shipping and the assistance of the Royal Navy. It can only be planned in detail by the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East in the light of conditionsexisting at the time. To cover the final evacuation it may be necessary to use navalcarrier-borne aircraft.- , AdministrationMaintenance of Forces in the Canal Zone27. The Force Maintenance Area will be established by D -f 18 months in theMoasear area to provide for the support of the forces which can no longer be main-tained from existing base depots.   This Maintenance Area will contain reserves,
including equipment, for one reinforcing brigade group for operations which mighthave to be undertaken during the withdrawal. These reserves will not includewhite oils (see paragraph 36).Theatre and Mobilisation Reserves28. Theatre and mobilisation reserves for the redeployed Middle Eastgarrison and the Arab Legion will be moved to redeployment areas and to Jordanrespectively in accommodation to be constructed. In addition it is necessary tomake plans, in agreement with countries concerned, to stock-pile the maximumquantity of war maintenance reserves in Jordan, Iraq and Turkey (Mardin). these will provide virtually the only remaining war maintenance reserves in the middle east.Provision of Shipping and Aircraft29. The necessary shipping and airlift can be made available for the with-drawal programme. An outline of the total movement of personnel and stores,vehicles and plant is given in Appendices &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; respectively.Major ImplicationsWar Plans30. Once evacuation has started we shall not be able to support our currentwar plans in the Levant. With the removal of the main Base installations and thewar maintenance reserves in the Middle East area, it will become impossible tosupport anything other than very minor operations in the Levant until some alternative facilities have been provided.The Suez Canal31. After D+12 months it will not be possible by military means to guarantee passage of shipping throughout the length of the Canal because thegarrison from Suez will have been withdrawn. The completion of the Plan andthe maintenance of our forces in Aden, Jordan and Iraq and the stockpiling ofwar reserves in Jordan and Iraq may, therefore, be prejudiced.The Delta32. After D + 6 months it will no longer be possible to undertake full-scaleintervention in the Delta in accordance with existing plans. Thereafter, shouldrescue operations in Cairo become necessary, the Force which could be despatchedwill depend upon the number of troops remaining in the Canal Zone at that stage,and on the situation at the time.Control of White Oils33. After D+12 months we shall not be able to control the pipeline carryingwhite oils to Cairo from Suez as our troops in the Agrud area will have been withdrawn. It is these oils which form the basis of Egyptian domestic economy.Strategic Reserves34. The strategic reserve as at present constituted will continue to be com-mitted by the Plan to the Canal Zone and the concentration of the Army. strategic reserve in the United Kingdom will be delayed. It will also be necessary to delay the planned disbandment of three transport squadrons of the Middle East AirForce.Treaty Obligations to Jordan35. It will be impracticable after D + 6 months to meet the existing plannedoperations to support these obligations. It will, therefore, be necessary to makenew and more limited plans dependent upon the situation at the time.Oil Storage36. After the withdrawal from Fanara at D +18 months there will be noreserve tankage and therefore no war reserves of white oil available in the.middle east unless we can secure the use of tankage at Haifa. Neither will it be possibleto provide sufficient white oils to support any major land or air operations from within the Canal Zone unless Fanara is reoccupied and re-stocked.
Use of Railways and Port Said   ... .    .37.   The planned:withdraw and plant is completely dependentupon the co-operation of the Egyptian State Railways, and of the Port Saidauthorities. Should this co-operation be withdrawn, technical reinforcements from the United Kingdom will be necessary. To take over operation of essentialsections of the line, and of installations at Port Said, to ensure the maintenanceof our Forces and of even a very limited withdrawal of stores, it will be necessaryto call out members of Section IA of the Army Emergency Reserve (i.e., those who may be called out for overseas service without Proclamation).38. If the full evacuation is to go ahead as planned, reinforcements inaddition&apos; to Section IA Of the Army Emergency Reserve would be required. Theircall-up would involve either a Royal Proclamation or Legislation, depending onthe gravity of the situation.Airfield Requirements39. It will be necessary to extend Ismalia airfield so as to provide a secOndoperational airfield within the final enclave in the Canal Zone and to accelerate,as far as possible, construction of the second RAF. airfield in Cyprus.Cold Storage40. As a result of the planned evacuation of Suez it will be necessary toestablish our main cold store holdings in Port Said. This will necessitate thehiring of civil storage in addition to existing War Department cold storage capacity.Army Works Requirements41. Additional covered accommodation for stores will be required in middle east Land Forces and in the United Kingdom. In the majority of cases it willnot be possible to build this in time with the result that many valuable stores willremain in the open. In order to reduce this time to the minimum the highest priority must be given at all stages to these projects. Projects for housing theredeployed garrison both in Middle East Land Forces and in the United Kingdommust continue with all speed.Cost42. The movement of personnel and freight, and the construction of essentialstorage both in United Kingdom and the Middle East, would involve extra costs which are not provided for under present redeployment plans. Furthermore, thecost of continuing to maintain a garrison in the Canal Zone would be larger than that which would be involved in maintaining the troops at the stations towhich they would go under those plans.

CABINET OFFICE /&quot;)RECORD COPY       copy no.iyL24TH FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETTELEVISION FILM PROGRAMMES:CONTROL OF FOREIGN MATERIALMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade  point of importance arises on clause 3(l)d of the television Bill which I feel should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet;2. It is generally agreed that, unless we prevent them, theprogramme contractors will overload their programmes with cheap andpopular American films.    We are pledged to avert this.3. &quot;We can try to do this in one of two ways:-(i)  The Authority could be instructed to securethat as far as possible a proper (or predominant)proportion of British films is used.(ii)  The programmes could be subject to a statutory control by means of a quota system.Responsibility on the Authority4. This is the method relied upon in the present draft of the    VTelevision Bill.    It would have certain advantages.    It is direct, simple,flexible, and leaves the programme contractors responsible to the Authorityalone.    On the other hand  -(i)  failure to impose a quota would invoke strong opposition from all sides of the film industry andthe Unions representing other branches of theentertainments industry;(ii)  the Authority would have great difficulty in holding balance between the Unions - who seek very severe restrictions on foreign films - and thebroadcasters, who would wish to use as manysuch films as possible;(iii)  if the Authority intended to make their controleffective they would have to face all theadministrative complications of a quota scheme without the statutory penalties available under such a scheme.
