secret copy No.C. (54) 5411th February, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETDEPORTATION OF BRITISH SUBJECTS: POWERS of commonwealth GOVERNMENTSNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in accordance with the request of the Cabinet (C.C. (54) 7th Conclusions,Minute 4), I circulate the attached memorandum summarising the present powersof Commonwealth Governments (and of Southern Rhodesia) to deport Britishsubjects. Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ceylon and Southern Rhodesia havepower to deport indigent immigrants as well as criminals and undesirables. NewZealand has limited powers and no power to deport indigent persons. India hasno power of deportation, and the Pakistan power is very limited.2. I do not know how frequently these powers are used but it appears thatthey are rarely exercised in relation to persons belonging to the United Kingdom.3. These further considerations are relevant. A power of deportation is of value only so far as another country is prepared to receive. Under internationalpractice a country is bound to receive its own nationals if deported from elsewhere.There are probably no clearly established conventions within the commonwealth and there is likely in practice to be considerable difficulty with India and Pakistanover specific cases. This aspect of the question would need investigation beforethe matter could be taken very far.4. There is also the question of the category of British subjects who shouldbe liable to deportation from the United Kingdom after conviction for the offencesspecified or for inability to support themselves. The criterion could not becitizenship because persons from the Colonies would then escape, and there wouldalso be difficulties about dual citizenship. If the criterion were residence, personscoming to this country would too quickly put themselves beyond the threat ofdeportation. Prima facie the criterion would require to be either birth in theUnited Kingdom itself, or domicile, or a substantial period of residence.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W, 1,10th February, 1954.45684,   Printed for the Cabinet.
