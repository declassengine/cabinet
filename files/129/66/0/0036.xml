GENERAL GRUENTHER&apos;S REMARKS AT SHAPE CORRESPONDENTS&apos;LUNCHEON, 11th JANUARY, 1954(Among those present were correspondents of The Times, Reuters,The Observer, Associated Press, New York Times, New YorkHerald Tribune, Time and Life, Time, France Soir and Le Monde)Some years ago, when cannibalism was still fashionable, a western newspapercorrespondent found himself on a South Pacific Island. He was picked up by acannibal group, and in due course they brought out the big pot, filled it with water,and started the fire. Our correspondent friend was very knowledgeable as are all correspondents and he had a pretty good idea of what was in store for him.He insisted that he be brought before the Cannibal Chief. After a heatedargument, his request was granted. He complained bitterly to the Chiefthat this treatment was a violation of the freedom of the press. And he added,&quot; Furthermore, if this outrage should take place, you will hang for it.&quot; The Chief,a very wise old man he had been to Oxford counselled the correspondent to calmhimself. Then he asked him, &quot; Now what is your job on your paper? &quot; Thecorrespondent replied, &quot; I have a very important position; I am an assistant editor.&quot;Whereupon the Chief said, &quot; I have some very good news for you. You are goingto receive a promotion.  In a couple of hours, you will be an &apos; Editor in Chief.&apos;&quot;Your President, Louis de Roche, has been very generous in his remarks aboutme today. I have, however, an uneasy feeling very much like that correspondenthad just before he got his &quot; promotion.&quot; Louis has asked me and I haveconsented to expose myself to your tender mercies in an on-the-record questionsession. I can already sense that you -like the cannibals have concocted acelebration whereby I may well be exposed to some of the blessings of freedomof the press.I am deeply honored to be your guest today. I am particularly pleased tohave the opportunity to discuss with you the status of the defense of western europe, and to outline some of the problems which face us in the future.The progress that we have made during these &quot; three years &quot; is much more that we thought possible on Sunday, January 7, 1951, the day General Eisenhowerarrived in Paris. You will recall that in Korea, it was feared that the united nations might be forced to evacuate from that peninsula within a few weeks.The general morale in Europe then was very, very low.You, as SHAPE correspondents, are aware at least in general terms of ouraccomplishments. I&apos;d like to tell you what that means from the standpointof our increased capabilities for defense. I believe it is fair to say that perhaps the outstanding development has been our increase in air strength, and particularly inthe striking power of our long-range strategic air force. A portion of this element of our power potential is based in the United Kingdom and in French Morocco. Itis not an integral part of the NATO forces because it is under United States control.But the accomplishments of this air force would affect vitally the fortunes of the shape forces if a war should take place, and we would count heavily on.the resultsof its efforts. Normally, its missions would be directed against targets deep in enemy territory. However, it is also available for the support of SACEUR againstappropriate targets which are closer to our front.The technological developments are such that, under present conditions,offensive air power has a big advantage over the defense. By that I mean that theB-47 airplane can fly at such great speed and at such a high altitude, that the task of intercepting it is a tremendously difficult one. The Soviet Union has no realanswer to that challenge at this time. This means, then, that air forces taking off from bases in this area can launch attacks with powerful effect against Sovietindustrial and other suitable targets. The bombing techniques are accurate and can be expected to produce devastating results. Certainly this overwhelmingretaliatory capability has a tremendous deterrent value and must be weighed soberlybv a potential aggressor.At the same time that we evaluate our long-range air situation, it is well toconsider our other capabilities. Our defense perimeter from the northern tip of norway to the eastern borders of Turkey extends over a distance of 4,000 miles.The strength which we have on that front is from three to four times as effective as it was when General Eisenhower.came to Europe, although obviously there is
no accurate arithmetical yardstick. But certainly the improvement is of that orderof magnitude. We then had not counting the forces of Greece and Turkey, sincethose countries did not join NATO until later a total of 15 divisions, some ofthem very weak. We had about 15 airfields. We had approximately 1,800 aircraft,of which 900 were in the United Kingdom. Of the 1,800, very few of them werejets. Those forces have now increased very considerably, and especially so inthe area of Central Europe which covers a front of approximately 500 miles.We have there an air-ground shield which, although still not strong enough, wouldforce an enemy to concentrate prior to attack. In doing so, the concentratingforce would be extremely vulnerable to losses from atomic weapon attacks.Our naval resources, although not yet strong enough to provide completeprotection to our ports and sea lanes, are superior to Soviet naval resources.Moreover, we now have an efficient organisation to utilise naval power effectively in an air-land battle.We can now use atomic weapons against an aggressor, delivered not only by long-range aircraft, but also by the use of shorter range planes, and by 280-mm.artillery.This air-ground team constitutes a very effective shield, and it would fight very well in case of attack. We think that it is of such strength that the Soviets do not now have in occupied Europe and by &quot; occupied Europe &quot; I refer to this generalarea (indicating on the map to satellite countries) sufficient air and ground forces to be certain of overwhelming this shield. Of course, the Soviets can move in additional forces to overcome that deficiency. But if they do, we should beable to get some warning of an impending attack. As a result of that warning,we ought to be able to increase our defensive strength considerably. In particular,we should be able to alert our air forces.Although we probably do not have adequate strength now to meet successfullya determined Soviet invasion, we certainly do have a force which can make thatattack extremely costly for an aggressor. We have had in the past three yearsremarkable success in building our strength. Furthermore, we have emergencyplans for the utilisation of our air, ground and naval forces if we should be attacked.That fact certainly should cause the men of the Kremlin to ponder carefullyany temptation they might have to undertake a major act of aggression.I believe it is an unquestionable fact-and that was the conclusion of the NATOMinisters when they met in Paris last month-that the defensive strength whichthe West has been able to build, since General Eisenhower came to Europe, hasbeen largely responsible for any diminution in the international tension whichhas taken place.The Ministers agreed at that same meeting that the peril of war is less imminentthan it has been at any time since NATO was organized. However, they made it clear unmistakably clear that the reason for this favorable developmentstemmed largely from our increase in strength, and above all because of the unitywe have been able to develop. No longer is it possible for an aggressor to contem-plate attacking the countries in NATO one by one without bringing on a general war.So much for the situation as it exists now. I want to stress again my belief thatour strength presents the Soviet Military High Command with a very difficult decision if, in fact, they should be asked to plan an invasion of the West. The high command would have to consider the strength of our shield, and also the factthat their industrial potential is still almost wide open to our air attacks. It is,of course, true that they might reason that they could win the first phase of thewar and in that analysis they would probably be correct-but over the longer period they would, at this time, face an almost impossibly difficult problem.It is anybody&apos;s guess as to what are the future intentions of the USSR. Ishould say that the only man who could find that out is probably Joe Kingsbury-Smith, who apparently carries on regular correspondence with Georgi Malenkov.But whatever the answer is, I think it is logical for us to assume especially con-sidering the internal problems which now beset Comrade Malenkov that hiscontemplative meditations make it unlikely that he will allow a deliberate attackto take place within the near future.As we attempt to peer further into the future, we run into many unknowns.To what extent will the Soviets be able to build up their defenses against long-rangeair attacks? To what extent will the Satellite forces at this time still onlyreasonably effective be developed? What will be the effectiveness of the new weapons which the Soviets are now developing? All of these are problems which concern us in our future planning, and give us cause for worry.
Our concern becomes greater when we look ahead, because we note that theincrease in our forces for the next three years will be much less than the increase which took place during the past three years.Generally speaking, the ground forces the active ground forces-except for those of Germany, will probably remain at about the same level as now. Pleasenote that I am talking about active ground forces, Our reserve ground forces willcontinue to be increased.There will also be an increase in air power, not only by the members of NATO,but also by the Germans. Our overall increase will not be as much as we had originally anticipated, but nevertheless it will be significant.Although there will be some increase in the effectiveness of our naval forces during the next few years, we will still be considerably below the original goals.I am making those statements based on the conclusions of the Annual review which the North Atlantic Council approved in its December meeting.On the credit side of the ledger, we can contemplate that during the next three to four years, we will have increased capabilities due to our new atomic weapons.These can be projected by long-range and short-range air power; they can be delivered by guided missiles, and also by artillery. Obviously those will give usa much greater fire power than we were able to plan on in 1951. Our big problemnow is to decide whether or not we can accomplish our mission with conventional forces substantially less than those we had originally estimated were necessary.In the final analysis, that is what the NATO Finance Ministers want to know. Thatis what the NATO governments are concerned with, because of the impact of defenseexpenditures on their economies. That is the task to which we are now general   -getically devoting our attention.Our so-called &quot; New Approach &quot; at SHAPE is to project our planning aheadsome three or four years, utilizing in our plans the forces which are probably goingto be available at that time, PLUS the new weapons which will probably be avail-able then.  Will those resources be adequate?We don&apos;t know the answer to that question as yet. You might well say, &quot; the answer should be very simple. If you needed X divisions and Y air groups on thebasis of conventional forces, surely those figures can be reduced now that you are able to count on atomic weapons.&quot; That is a correct statement as far as it goes.What must be borne in mind, however, is that our estimates for the so-calledconventional &quot; requirements,&quot; were, in general, calculated only for the first 30 days of a war. That is especially true for ground forces. If those &quot; requirements &quot; hadbeen calculated for the period of the first year or for a longer period, there is noquestion but that they would be reduced, and reduced significantly, by new weapons. But it doesn&apos;t follow necessarily that the &quot; requirements &quot; for the first.30 days are going to be reduced.You undoubtedly understand that we plan to utilize those so-called &quot; first30-day forces &quot; in order to create a shield to force an aggressor to concentrate. Ifwe did not have that shield, the effectiveness of our atomic bomb attacks wouldbe reduced considerably. We plan a &quot; Forward Strategy &quot; but we have not yet reached the strength to implement it. That is one reason why we emphasise that a German contribution is so essential for the defense of Europe.The problem of the &quot; New Approach &quot; is receiving top priority in our head-quarters now. It is not just a question of determining whether or not we shallbe able to discharge our mission with the forces that we shall have available three to four years from now, but also of assessing the best balance between these forces. In other words, is it desirable for us to have, in certain areas, fewer activeforces and more reserve forces? Is it desirable that we cut down on the strengthof one service and increase the strength of another?As to the adequacy of the forces which we shall have 3 or 4 years hence todischarge our mission, we don&apos;t know the answer to that problem yet. We don&apos;targue with anyone who says that those forces will be inadequate. We simplydOn&apos;t know. I might add that there are some people who say that the forces weshall have available will not be enough. There is one authority who is not amember of our staff who argues about like this: &quot; If only our side had atomic weapons, and the other side didn&apos;t, there is no question but that the advent ofnew weapons would lessen Our requirements. But when the adversary also hasthese weapons-and also when it is quite certain that if an attack is launched hewill be the one to launch it-my contention is that more conventional forces willbe required than were needed before the advent of atomic weapons.&quot; Now I am not giving that opinion any validity. I simply quote it as a point of view, to show
that the problem is inherently an extremely difficult one. This is complicated bythe fact that some of the weapons involved particularly some of the guided missiles are not yet even in production, but are still in the proving ground.Our main task for the future, as I see it, is to help the people of the 14 member nations continue to believe that NATO has been created for the preservation ofpeace. They must have faith that we can maintain that peace by creating a forcestrong enough that aggression will be so unprofitable that it will not take place.It sounds like a cliche to add that, above all, we must have unity during the difficult period ahead. But that is basically the core of the problem we face.You correspondents play an extremely important part in this organization,since you deal regularly with a large portion of the 400 million people in NATO.I am sure that you feel that NATO is performing a vitally important function,and I know you will continue to assist in spreading knowledge of the organizationto the people. I hope you will criticize us at any time that you consider that weare not doing our job well. The one thing we cannot stand is indifference.SHAPE is now engaged in working out the schedule for our 1954 manoeuvres.The concept and size will be about the same as last year, except that there willbe much more emphasis this year on the simulated tactical use of atomic weapons.Moreover, those manoeuvres will tend to bring out changes in tactics which arenecessary in an atomic age. . Certain trends are already fairly obvious. Conceal-ment is going to be more important than ever before. The premium on mobilityand on reliable communications will be very high. Our troops must be able to-survive on the battlefield under conditions where the slightest mistake may cause the destruction of entire units.We will have many communication exercises where the staffs work in the fieldwithout troops. Later, this summer and in the fall we will have manoeuvres involvingtroops under simulated battlefield conditions.For the third year we shall have an indoor exercise at SHAPE directed byField-Marshal Montgomery. It will take place from the 26th of April to the 30thand all senior commanders as well as the national chiefs of staff will attend to study the probable developments of future warfare.As for my attitude towards the future, I am soberly optimistic. I have seenthis project develop from a very discouraging status. I have seen the effect its development has had on the Free World, and also on the other side of the iron curtain. I have noted the tribute paid to our alliance by the USSR because inrecent months the dissolution of NATO has become the Number One objective of Soviet foreign policy. We have many deficiencies but the other fellow is havinghis troubles too and they are not minor ones either. I am certain our enterprisemust succeed if our civilization is to survive in the form in which we know it.I am most grateful to you for this luncheon to-day. You have always treatedSHAPE most generously, and for that I thank you. I pray that we shall continueto merit your support as we endeavor to play our role in attaining the vital NATOobjective the preservation of peace in this troubled world.I shall now be very glad to answer questions, gentle ones of course.Question PeriodQ. General, you indicated that the existing allied forces on the central frontconstitute a sufficient shield to compel the forces in occupied Europe to concentratebefore an attack! It seems to me that that might create the impression that theneed for a German contribution has lessened. Could you clarify that point,please, sir?A. Although I stated that the Soviets do not have sufficient force in occupiedEurope and remember that I said &quot; occupied Europe &quot; to be sure of a successfulinvasion, that does not mean that they could not bring in reinforcements. Theycan bring them in and quickly too. If that happened the situation would change to our great disadvantage. Our shield would be much too weak to resist such ablow. In other words, although our air-ground shield is probably strong enough for the Soviet forces now in occupied Europe, that situation could change very rapidly-much more rapidly than we could increase the strength of our shield.A German contribution will lessen that disadvantage.Secondly, the satellite forces consisting of some 70 divisions are only moderatelyeffective at this time.  The Soviets have been concentrating on improving these
forces, and we are beginning to reach a period when their strength will be a verysignificant power factor against us.But perhaps of even greater importance is the fact that we urgently need aGerman contribution in order to implement our Forward Strategy. WithoutGerman forces that strategy is not possible.Q. General, would you think that in the event that there will be a long delay or no passage of EDC, and the United States gets into this &quot; agonisingreappraisal&quot; do you think it would reduce the United States commitment of forces in Europe?A. I wouldn&apos;t &apos;t know about that. Your judgement as to whether the UnitedStates would reduce its commitment under those conditions is certainly as good as mine maybe better. It is clear, though, that the United States at this time hasno intention of reducing its European commitment. At least we at SHAPE haveno knowledge of such an intention, and I think we would know, because of thenecessity of taking such factors into account in our advance planning work. Asto the form that the United States reappraisal would take, if EDC does not pass, Idon&apos;t know, and it would be inappropriate for me to make any speculation.I should like to make clear, however, that from the standpoint of creating acondition of strength in the important area of Central Europe, if we do not get theGerman forces to bolster it that is pep-up the strength in that area we will suffer a great deal more agony that Mr. Dulles indicated in his talk. He used thestatement &quot; an agonising reappraisal,&quot; but I can assure you that we are going to bein great pain if we do not have the German contribution.Q. Presumably the pain would be even greater if the United States pulled outtwo or three or four American divisions.A.   That is true.Q. General Gruenther, in undertaking this &quot; new look,&quot; are we taking intoconsideration the possibility that a stronger Soviet atomic arsenal, or some otherfactor may arise to prevent us from using atomic and hydrogen weapons?A. We are assuming in our study that atomic weapons will be available to both sides. One of the questions which we are also asking ourselves is &quot; Wherewould we be if a decision were made that atomic weapons would not be used by either side?&quot; Naturally, that is another problem, and a very important one. More-over, it is very complicated. The particular plan that you pull from the shelf maybe well formulated, but if your forces have been built on the assumption that Plan Ais going to.be used, it is probable that you will not be able to put into effect Plan bif the forces available are those based on Plan A. In other words, the strategicconcept, and the resulting composition of forces, for a plan in which atomic weaponsare contemplated may and in all probability will be vastly different from a plan in which atomic weapons are not going to be used.Q. General Gruenther, doesn&apos;t the use of Plan A or Plan B depend to a largeextent on whether or not atomic weapons are outlawed?A. That is one of the matters we shall try to analyse. We must determine what position we would be in if a decision were made to outlaw atomic weapons.As you know, the Soviets in their answer to the Presidents Atomic Pool proposal,reaffirmed their demand that all atomic weapons be outlawed. There is noquestion what the Soviets have in mind, and their reasons are quite obvious.Q. General, in building the forces according to one plan or another, whenwill we reach the point of no return?A. that&apos;s a tough one. You are coming into the area which Mr. Churchillexplored in his recent talk when he said that we may get to a point where the potential to kill on both sides is so great that neither side may decide to kill at all.I believe that was what in effect he said of course, in typical Churchillian phrase-ology. Now it is entirely conceivable that the horrors of atomic war may be soimpressed upon the world that the danger of a third world war may be lessened con-siderably. But, if you develop this idea one step further and say that when war isjoined, atomic weapons will not be used, I would disagree with that.   I don&apos;t think
Mr. Churchill advanced that thesis, but I would differ with, anyone who did. Itis true that in the last war, chemical warfare was not used by either side. I donot think that the situations are analogous.Now your question probably had a wider implication, namely: &quot; Where dowe stand when both sides have large numbers of atomic weapons, and extensivecapabilities of delivering them?&quot; I don&apos;t have the answer to that query. For-unfortunately, that situation is still some years away. We are working on a plan whichis probably a simpler one, namely, projecting ourselves from three to four years ahead and I can assure you that&apos;s difficult enough for us.Q. General, in connection with the ability of the B-47&apos;s to penetrate theinterior of Russia, and so on, it&apos;s fairly obvious from what has been printed alreadythat we should be shifting over to guided missiles principally for civil defense, or atleast moving in that direction. What sort of a lead in time would you estimate that we have over the Russians in that same capability? In other words, the point at which the Russians can launch guided missiles which will really be effective against our B-47&apos;s?A. I wouldn&apos;t &apos;t be able to give a- numerical figure, although I think we dohave an edge now. One point in your question that I would like to challengeslightly, and that is the implication that air defense will depend entirely on guided missiles. After all, our best air defense is the destruction of enemy air power at itssource. Failing that, the air defense of cities and critical areas will depend uponthree types of weapon systems: guided missiles, anti-aircraft artillery and inter-ceptor aircraft. All are complementary, and tie in to an extensive warning net.Q. I meant, developed to the extent that they would be effective against our planes.A- Were you talking about guided missiles or rockets in the interceptoraircraft? Naturally, the armament is very very important. I think, however, thatan even greater difficulty, under current conditions, is the ability to direct an inter-ceptor from a ground position and get it up in the air in time and directed againsta hostile attacking plane. The overall defense problem is one which the Sovietshave probably not solved yet, and that is one reason why the B-47 has such a bigadvantage now.  How long it will maintain that advantage I cannot say.Q.   Is it then simply a matter of developing a B-47 by the Soviets?A. In other words you are really asking if the Soviets developed a B-47 oftheir own would that solve their problem completely? I doubt it. They would still have to be able to get the bases close enough to the principal enemy target in orderto deliver heavy attacks. The principal target is the industrial potential of theUnited States. I do not say that the Soviets cannot attack the United States now,nor that it would not be a tremendous advantage for them to have large numbersof a plane as effective as our B-47. Even so, with the well developed complex ofallied air bases, we would still have a very effective force for the destruction of soviet war-making capacity.The effectiveness of our long-range strategic airpower both now and in thefuture is so great that I don&apos;t feel that we are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the USSR.That is why I am so eager that our own people will not lose hope and faith in our ability to solve this problem. We have made tremendous progress in the last fewyears, and any tendency to downgrade that success would be a colossal mistake. i will grant you, of course, that the Soviet Union probably has a capability to destroysome European cities now. And I recognize that it is no comfort to a person living in any of these cities to have someone tell him, &quot; Well, don&apos;t worry; they can&apos;tdestroy the United States&apos; potential, yet!&quot; That will give these poor people littleconsolation. But, even so, it is a matter which the Soviet High Command mustthink about very seriously.Q. You mentioned the possibility of a German air contribution. We haven&apos;theard much about that possibility.A. that&apos;s because you gentlemen are largely ground force minded. Perhapsyou fellows are too much under the influence of Army officers. There&apos;s a tendency for you to talk about divisions too much. But there&apos;s another extremely important element of force in the world to-day, and that is airpower.   A part of the EDC
plan envisages that the Germans will make an air force contribution, that is, a tactical air contribution. Please understand Fm really not insulting you,Mr. Cadett; it is Bill Stoneman I&apos;m after, because he&apos;s very much of a divisioncounter.Q. General Gruenther, when you spoke of the assumption that both sideswould have atomic weapons in your study of equipment three or four years ahead,are you assuming a roughly equal supply of atomic weapons?A. Probably not. But that answer in itself doesn&apos;t prove anything. what you really have to consider is whether or not the enemy has a significant supply.For example, if you have fifty bombs and the other fellow has one you certainly have a big advantage. But now let&apos;s assume that one side has 5,000 and the other side has 2,000. It does not follow that the side with 5,000 has an overwhelmingadvantage. Certainly 2,000 bombs would be a significant number, even if the other side had as many as 5,000. In other words, in answering your question ratherindirectly, it isn&apos;t necessary to assume &quot; roughly an equal supply of atomic weapons &quot; in order to create a difficult problem. We face that problem in a veryacute form as soon as the enemy has what may be considered as a significantnumber.Q. You use your own assumption on the basis that on our side we have thelong-term advantage with atomic weapons?A. I doubt that we have reached a satisfactory answer to that question yet.Well have to do considerably more study and research before we can even cometo an answer on what assumption should be made in that regard.Q. I understand that some time ago at a meeting of a Provincial Press groupyou mentioned that your headquarters are considering alternatives to EDC.A. If I ever made a statement that could be interpreted that way I should liketo correct it now.   We are not studying any alternative to EDC at SHAPE.Q. General, if atomic weapons are outlawed, what effect would that have onthe balance of power in conventional weapons?A. Under present conditions I think it v/ould very definitely operate to our disadvantage, for reasons which are quite clear to all of you, I am sure. We cannot put ourselves in a position where the issue will depend on the conflict of largemasses of ground troops, and conventional weapons.Q. General, assuming maintenance of even a minimum momentum in theimprovement of air forces, do you see any offset in the balance-of-power situationin Europe over the years ahead of what you&apos;re now trying to plan?A.   Would you elaborate on that question, please?Q. I&apos;m saying that we&apos;re assuming that there&apos;s going to be a slight up-curve,and then the addition of the German divisions, and the satellites. If there is nolet-up on the basis of what we&apos;ve done so far, and what it appears to you overthe plan of the next four or five years, do you think we can maintain the militarybalance of power in Europe we now have?A. I&apos;m not sure that I have an answer to that problem because it depends upon the developments of the next few years. A fairly important factor in the answer to that question is the determination as to the status of the balance of power now. With our technical know-how, however, and our determination tosee this thing through, I am sure that our military potential and especially our air power is going to continue to improve. Of course, the balance of powerdepends on more than military strength. We must first of all maintain a strongeconomy.Q.   I take it you feel we have the defensive balance at the moment, at least?A. Certainly we have balance enough to create a very strong deterrent. Wehave an overwhelming capacity to retaliate. And that deterrent is-probably our best defense. Now if, for example, an answer were found in the near future to theB--47 threat, and three out of every five B-47&apos;s that appeared over Soviet territory in the event of war were shot down-that would create a new problem and a veryrugged one at that.
Q.   General, if war came now, would we control the air over the battlefield?A. That would depend largely on how the war started. War could break out as a result of a miscalculation a mistake or it could break out after a deliberatebuild-up. If it developed as a result of a mistake, meaning with Soviet air power in its present locations, we would have an excellent opportunity of having reasonably good Control of the air over the battlefield. And, of course, a vital factor in securing that control would be the results of our attacks on enemy air bases. As you wellknow, the best way to get control of the air is to destroy enemy planes while theyare on the ground. Under the second situation, namely war developing from apremeditated build-up, the Soviets to-day would have a fairly good chance ofwearing us down, by causing great attrition to our tactical air forces. They would pay for the effort and pay heavily. And all of that time we would be poundingunmercifully targets deep in enemy territory. In my opinion, eventually we wouldwin the war. But that wouldn&apos;t &apos;t necessarily mean that we would control the air overthe Western European battlefield, which was your question. I can assure you,however, we are in a much better position to gain that control than we were three years ago.Q. Would you just as soon have the 1,500 German tactical planes and let the divisions go for a while?A. that&apos;s like asking whether you would rather lose your left leg or yourright leg. We need both the ground and the air elements in our shield, and wewould be most reluctant to do without either. I think if we were faced with thattough alternative, we would probably try to get some air forces and some divisions.But naturally that decision would be a tough one.Q. General Gruenther, is the assumption that the Russians will mass for anattack, offering an atomic target, while we won&apos;t offer them an atomic target bymassing, based on the idea that we will just stay behind defensive positions suchas the Rhine, and not try to advance, ourselves?A. No. Initially of course we would be on the defensive, but as I said earlier,our objective is to create as small a target as possible. We create that situation byconcealment, by dispersion, and by great mobility. But I can assure you that weare developing the counter offensive spirit and in no sense a Maginot Line type ofdefense. Now, you might ask, &quot; Will we ever go forward?&quot; The answer is &quot; yes.&quot;But, under the probable condition that we have to absorb a heavy blow initially we will probably do some falling back before we go forward. I do want to make clear, however, that, in the training of our forces we continually stress the valueof the offensive, even though we do envisage that we may have to go on the defensive initially.Q.   Don&apos;t we get hit by their atomic weapons?A. Yes, that is certainly a great danger. That is the reason we are examiningour tactics; that is why we are perfecting our training so that we will not sufferheavy casualties from an atomic attack.Q. General, how soon will it be before you start getting results of some ofthe studies on the &quot; new approach,&quot; and start deciding this new atomic force?-4. I should say we&apos;ll begin to get some answers in a few months. you should understand, however, that this will be a continuing study. Our first resultsmay not be too good. As we look back three years from now on the type of planning we are engaged in currently, we may consider that it was very amateurish.I can assure you, however, that the other fellow is going to have that problem also,and he certainly has no monopoly on brains. His problem is going to be a difficult one because he is going to be forced to concentrate in order to attack, and that is going to make him very vulnerable.Q.   What sort of mistakes do you have in mind?A. As an example, we might study the problem of a particular sector whereit had been estimated that, with conventional weapons, it might take say tendivisions to hold.   We might under the New Approach planning decide that three
divisions plus a certain number of atomic weapons would be sufficient. Thatwould probably be a good solution from the standpoint of a Finance Minister.But in this type of struggle there is no prize for second place. If it is an error,it could be a catastrophe. There are numerous areas of a similar nature wheremiscalculations can be made.Q. General, can you tell us the nationality of the gentleman you referred toearlier who said we would need more instead of less forces?A. He was an American. But that doesn&apos;t mean he was right. Fm sure youunderstand that.Mr. de Roche feels that you are all eager to get back to work. I don&apos;t want to be a partner in keeping you away from your desks. Many, many thanks for your kindness.
