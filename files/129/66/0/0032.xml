(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)cabinet office record COPY copy no.     ^1st march, 1954cabinetALLOWANCES FOR SERIQUSLY DISABLED MENMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceIf the cost of living remains steady, we ought to be able to hold the main benefit and pension rates for another year by which time the reviewof the main National Insurance scheme should be on the way to completion.War pensions are not included in this review but it is obvious that ifNational Insurance pensions are raised as the result of the review, warpensions will have to be raised as well.    Meanwhile most war pensionersare in employment and share in any wage increases that occur from timeto time.2. There is, however, one class for whom I think something shouldbe done immediately.    I refer to the man who, as the result of a war dis-ability, is unable to work.    It is constantly being urged upon me that the man who is prevented by his disability from working should be given an income which bears a reasonable relation to the wages he might other/isebeearning.3. If a man is so seriously disabled as to qualify for all the special allowances for men who need extra care and attention he may be getting asmuch as  7 10s. Od. a week.    But there are others who may be gettingfrom 27s. c-d. to 55s. a week basic pension plus an allowance (known as theunemployability supplement) of 3 5s. making 62s.  :d. to 90s, a week.    Thesefigures are constantly being compared with average earnings of the order of 8 to  10 a week.    I think a strong case exists for doing something for thesemen.    I would like to increase their unemployability supplement by 10s. aweek.    This would cost the Exchequer rather more than    million in a full year,4. A similar situation exists under the scheme for industrial injuries.There the man who is rendered permanently incapable of work as the resultof his injury receives an allowance at the standard rate of 32s. od. a week inaddition to his disability pension.    I think this too should be increased by10s. a week making it 42s. 6d. as compared with the 45s. a week for thewar-disabled.    I would retain this difference between the two rates as amark of that preference for the war-disabled to which we as a Party are committed.5. The increase of the unemployability supplement under theIndustrial Injuries scheme will also be payable to the class known as &quot;oldWorkmen&apos;s Compensation cases&quot;.    This will enable us to do something fora class which has always attracted great sympathy in the House.NOTE: A married man in either of the classes referred to in paragraphs 3and 4 is entitled to an additional 21s. c-d. for his wife and 10s. 6d.for a child.secret(54) 82
60 I estimate that the increase proposed for* the industrially-disabled will involve a net additional expenditure of about  -f million in afull year, payable from the Industrial Injuries Insurance Fund,70 The increase in the war pensions allowances will require an alteration in the Royal Warrant,     The increase in the Industrial Injuriespayments will require legislation.8. I therefore ask approval for the announcement of an increase of10so a week in the unemployability supplement for war pensions and ofour intention to seek legislative approval for a similar increase in theunemploya.bility supplement under the Industrial Injuries scheme - the dateof the announcement to be agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,,00P0Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,   W0C02. ,1ST MARCH, 1954.
