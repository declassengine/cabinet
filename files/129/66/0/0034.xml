secret.(54) 84 CABINET OFFICE copy no. IS- RECORD COPY -10th march, 1954CABINETscampton airfieldNote by the Secretary of the CabinetScampton is one of two airfields near Lincoln which have been used for bomber aircraft for many years.    It is now proposed to developthese two airfields, so that the new long-range medium bombers canoperate from them.2.       In choosing these two airfields for this purpose the Secretary ofState for Air has been influenced by the following considerationsi-(i)    Airfields for these new bombers should be sited more than30 miles from the coast, in order to reduce the danger from sneak raidersThey should also be within a reasonable distance of the fuel pipeline andthe bomb stores.(ii)     It would be extravagant to build new permanent accommodation for R. A. f. squadrons when existing accommodation can be expanded - asit can at Scampton.(iii)     Of all the alternatives the proposed development of Scamptonmakes the least encroachment on agricultural land.3.        The following arguments have been advanced against this proposalto develop Scamptons-(i)     The extension will cut Ermine Street;  and a by-pass road ofabout three miles will have to be built.    This will arouse criticism on theground of historical sentiment.(ii)     If Scampton is developed, there will be two jet airfields - Scamptonand Waddington - within a radius of about 5 miles from the centre ofLincoln.    No other airfields projected for jet bombers are near cities.4.       A decision is urgently needed, if the programme of Class Iairfields is not to get out of step with the expected deliveries of &apos;V-typebombers.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, s. W. 1.9th MARCH, 1954.
