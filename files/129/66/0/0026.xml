(ID(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)24TH FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETTELEVISION bill memorandum by the Solicitor-GeneralParagraph 4 of Annex 1 to C. (54) 71 does not, I am sorry tosay, correctly express my reasons for the expansion of Clause 5(4).2. The fact that Clause 5(5) gives the Authority arbitrary powerto determine or suspend a programme at any time may deter prospectiveprogramme contractors from coming into the scheme.3. This powerful weapon is, I feel, unlikely to be used by theAuthority in relation to minor breaches of the code set out in Clause&quot;3(1).It is unlikely that the Authority will suspend, or threaten to suspend,a programme on account of, for instance, one offensive representationof a living person.    But the Bill does not, without the expansion of clause 5(4), provide for any penalty short of suspension of the programme.4. The Authority might, without the expanded Clause 5(4), seek to insert penalty provisions in the contracts.    The object of referring to them in the Bill is to enable the Authority to insist on their inclusion.5. I have in mind a maximum penalty for each breach of the code,of the sum of  500.    This should, I feel, be a sufficient deterrent andthe Authority could, if it felt it was right to do so, accept a lesser sum.secret cabinet office record copy .(54) 76R.E.M-B.Law Officers1 Department, W,Ca224TH FEBRUARY, 1954.
