(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT))NFIDENTIALC. (52) 206 COPY NOv20th JUNE, 1952..CABINETTHE BROADMOOR INQUIRYMemorandum by the Minister of HealthFollowing the escape of Straffen, on 29th April, the Cabinet, at their meeting on 7th May (C.C.(52) 50th Conclusions, Minute 1), approved proposals made by my predecessor for an independent inquiry into the security arrangements at Broadmoor.   The Committee appointed to conduct this inquiry have now reported.2. I attach a copy of the report.   There is a convenient summary of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations on pages 10 and 11.3. The report is, on the whole, reassuring,   I think there would be every advantage in publishing it in full and without delay.4.        There is considerable detail in the recommendations.   The merits ofsome of them (for example, that any communication by patients with the minister or the Board of Control should be seen by the Medical Superintendent) are atleast open to argument.   But, in view of the circumstances of this inquiry, i feel sure that it will be wise to accept the report as a whole, without qualificationswhich would only provoke further discussion.5. It will be noted that the report finds that there has been no relaxation of security rules since Broadmoor passed to the Board of Control in 1949(paragraph 15) and - although this was not intended to be within the Committee&apos;reference - that it rejects any suggestion that the control of Broadmoor ought tobe returned to the Home Office (paragraph 17).6.        There is one matter, not dealt with in the report, of which my colleagues should be informed.   The Board of Control, as managers of the Institution, have carried out in the normal way a full investigation into the circumstancesattending the escape of Straffen. They found that responsibility lay primarily on aparticular attendant, who was in charge of the patient at the time.   He failed tokeep the patient under continuous direct observation when he allowed him to goto a door, which he knew to be open, into a yard.   The Board&apos;s disciplinaryinquiry established neglect of duty by this attendant, and the Board recommended a severe reprimand,  A more severe penalty would have been recommended butfor the fact that the attendant had nine years1 otherwise unblemished record.   UnderSection 12 of the criminal Lunatic Asylum Act, 1860, criminal proceedings can also be taken against an attendant for negligence in certain circumstances;  the papers in this case were laid by the Board before the Director of public prosecutions, who has decided that prosecution would not be justifiable,7,        If my colleagues agree, I should now like to be authorised: -(a) to publish the report of the Inquiry forthwith as a White Paper;(b) on the day it is laid before the House to make a statement onthe lines of the draft which I append.

REPORT OF THE BROADMOOR^    INQUIRY COMMITTEETo the Right Honourable Iain Macleod, M.P.,Minister of Health.Sir,I. We were appointed on 12th May, 1952, with the following termsof reference : &quot; To inquire into the adequacy of the security arrangements atBroadmoor, and to make recommendations.&quot;2. We have held seven meetings at one of which we heard evidence in public from several Local Authorities. We also heard evidence in privateat Broadmoor, in Reading and in London. We spent some eight hoursat Broadmoor hearing evidence from various officers and making an inspec-tion of the Institution, and we desire to express our appreciation to dr. Hopwood, the Medical Superintendent, for the help he gave us in ourinvestigations. We have also considered letters and memoranda sent to us by various Local Authorities, organisations and persons. A list of theGovernment Departments, Local Authorities, organisations and persons whohave submitted evidence, both written and oral, is given in Appendix I tothis Report.BACKGROUNDHistory and Control3.   Broadmoor was opened in 1863 as an asylum for criminal lunaticsunder the provisions of the Criminal Lunatic Asylums Act, 1860.   Thefollowing classes of persons can be ordered to be kept there by Warrant ofone of Her Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretaries of State: (a) persons who can be ordered to be kept in safe custody during her majesty&apos;s pleasure. (These include any person charged with a criminal offence who is found insane on arraignment, or in respect of whom a jury has returned a special verdict that he was guilty of the actor omission charged against him but was insane at the time he did the act or made the omission);(b) any person whom the Secretary of State may order under any act of Parliament to be removed to a mental hospital;(c) any prisoner who before or after trial is certified to be insane.4. Under the Criminal Lunatic Asylums Act, 1860, a criminal lunaticasylum was managed, and the treatment of the inmates was carried out,under the superintendence and direction of a Council of Supervision appointedby the Secretary of State. In the Criminal Justice Bill presented to parliament by the Home Secretary in 1938, it was proposed to transfer the control and management of criminal lunatic asylums* to the Board of Control. We note in passing that the proposal was not opposed during the debates on the Bill* There was, in fact, no criminal lunatic asylum, other than Broadmoor, in England andWales.-     -     &quot;&apos;&apos; &quot; 3 A.42443 c*
in the House of Commons. That Bill did not become an Act, but the change was made by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948. By that Act criminal lunaticasylums were vested in the Minister of Health and put under the management of the Board of Control, the transfer taking effect on 1st April, 1949; theirtitle was changed to that of &quot; Broadmoor Institutions&quot;; and the term&quot; criminal lunatic &quot; was changed to &quot; Broadmoor patient.&quot; It still r^iinsthe function of the Secretary of State to make orders for the remoPf. ofBroadmoor patients to and from Broadmoor.5. There are two other State Institutions managed by the Board ofControl, viz., Rampton Hospital and Moss Side Hospital. These institutionsare for the reception of mental defectives of dangerous or violent propensitieswho are unsuitable for care and treatment in an ordinary mental deficiencyinstitution. In a similar way the dangerous or violent propensities of a largenumber of Broadmoor patients distinguish Broadmoor from ordinary mental hospitals administered under the National Health Service Act, 1946, byRegional Hospital Boards. Further, the nursing staff at these three institutionshave a Civil Service status and are members of the Prison Officers&apos; Associa-tion although they are regarded as part of the National Health Service. Wemention the connection between Broadmoor and the other two State Institu-tions again in paragraph 10.Broadmoor Patients and Staff1938        1st June, 1952average number     number ofof patients patients...      ...      ...    ; 595 701..      ...      ......      181 190Total     ..........      ...      776 891The increase in the number of patients has taken place gradually during the intervening years and has been mainly in the age groups under 35 years.7.7. The medical staff in 1938 consisted of the Medical Superintendent,the Deputy Medical Superintendent, and two other medical officers. Thereis now provision for a fifth medical officer, but the post is at present vacant.8. In 1938 the authorised number of attendants (including tradeinstructors) was 148 male, 49 female, total 197. The present authorisednursing staff (including trade instructors) is 279 but on 1st June, 1952, theactual staff was 193 male, 67 female, total 260, being 19 under strength.We should, however, point out that some of the increase in staff has beenoccasioned by changes in the system of working and regrading of posts,e.g., we have been told that when a three-shift system of working was instituted in 1941, an increase of 41 attendants was authorised. Thepensionable age for nurses is 55 years, but owing to difficulty of recruit-ment there are now 14 male nursing staff over the age of 60 years (5 of who mare over the age of 65 years), including some temporary assistants engagedduring the war. Some of these would have been released long ago if youngrecruits had been available. The average age of the male nursing staff has increased from 40 years in 1938 to 45 years in 1952 and that of thefemale nursing staff from 31 years in 1938 to 40 years in 1952......... Pay and Conditions of Service of Staff9. In 1938 the starting wage of a male recruit was substantially abovethe wage which could then be earned in many other occupations in the.MaleFemale
locality and consequently Broadmoor. had no difficulty in picking andobtaining a sufficient number of recruits to keep the staff up to-its requiredcomplement. The wage now payable to a student male nurse at Broadmoorat the commencement of training is  270 per annum, or about  5 4s. per week,which, in spite of certain allowances, does not compare as favourably withthe &quot;;ages of other local employments as did the wage of 1938. The com-mygkag wage of  270 per annum is  40 per annum more than the wage paidto sTUdents in ordinary mental hospitals who in turn receive  30 per annummore than a student in a general hospital.10. Prior to the management of Broadmoor being transferred to theBoard of Control the Institution had its own Departmental Whitley Council.In 1945 attendants were placed in appropriate nursing and other grades; pay and overtime rates of nursing staff became related to those for mental hospitals with effect from 1944, subject to the addition of a &quot; lead &quot; of  40.Subsequent to the transfer of the Institution to the management of the Boardof Control in 1949, a Central Whitley Committee covering the three StateInstitutions was established together with local Whitley Committees for eachinstitution. All these committees are in fact committees of the Ministry ofHealth Departmental Whitley Council though in practice they have a consider -able measure of independence. By two agreements of the Central WhitleyCommittee the scales of pay of the nursing staffs of the State Institutionshave been revised to correspond with the revised scales for mental nursesin the National Health Service (subject to the continuation of the  40&quot; lead &quot;). By the same agreements all the conditions of service appropriate to the nursing staffs of the National Health Service were applied to nursingstaff newly recruited to the State Institutions, and the conditions of servicerelating to hours of duty and payment for overtime of the National health service were applied to the existing Broadmoor staff.Maintenance Staff11. Until 1948 a small maintenance staff was included in the staff of theInstitution, major repairs and alterations being done by outside contractors.Since 1st April, 1948, the maintenance of the Institution has been the respon-sibility of the Ministry of Works which employs its own staff. At the presenttime extensive repairs are being carried out and the maintenance staff employed in the Institution and on the estate now numbers 82. We mentionlater some of the ways in which this matter affects the security problem.In addition to the buildings within the security wall there are maiiy other buildings on the estate including 171 houses for staff (53 of which have been built since the war).Patients&apos; Accommodation12. Patients&apos; accommodation at Broadmoor has been built in a series ofblocks, which are largely self contained, each block having 3 wards.Patients are allotted to the different blocks according to their mental con-dition and behaviour. The degree of supervision and conversely the libertyand privileges allowed to the individual patients varies from block to block.Some wards, such as those in the block for refractory patients, consist of single rooms, some wards have dormitories as well, and in the wards forthe best behaved patients a single room may be awarded as a privilege. Somepatients may only leave their wards under close escort for exercise in anenclosed airing yard, others are taken into more spacious and more attractiveairing yards in large groups, while the best behaved and most privilegedpatients known as parole patients can, during the daytime, go into the terracegardens and canteen or may be allowed into certain other blocks to visit
friends among the other patients. We were informed that no patient who might be dangerous in the event of escape would ever be granted parolestatus. The Institution, together with its gardens, workshops, administrativebuildings, large kitchen garden and playing fields, covering an area of 38 acres,is enclosed in a high security wall. On the estate outside the security wallthere is a farm of 164 acres to which the most reliable patients nfevbetaken under escort in working parties of not more than eight. PatientR/aybe rewarded for work and good behaviour by way of a credit which maybe drawn on for purchases in a well-stocked canteen. No patient is allowedto have cash in his possession. There are, of course, many social activities in the Institution which have been devised both for the relaxation and mentaltreatment of patients and which it is not necessary for us to describe further.Escapes13. Not even a prison can guarantee that no prisoner can ever escape.In this connection we set out in Appendix II extracts from the Reports ofthe Commissioners of Prisons for 1947 and 1950 regarding the increased number of escapes from prisons in post-war years. Before the war Broad-moor had a very good record in this respect. In the 9 years 1932-1940 therewere no escapes. In the next 9 years, 1941-1949, there were 6 escapes.Since 1st January, 1950, there have been 6 escapes, 3 during 1950, 2 during1951, and the one on the 29th April, 1952, which led to our appointment.Two patients escaped together in 1950, the same happened in 1951, so thatin 1950 there were two incidents and in 1951 there was one incident only.We have enquired closely into the circumstances of all these escapes but itis unnecessary for us to refer to them in detail, especially as we understand the circumstances of the last escape are or may be the subject of otherproceedings. We think it right, however, to point out that in two casesescapes were made possible by the use of a key made by a patient.14. At this point we mention that by Section 12 of the Criminal LunaticAsylums Act, 1860, Parliament not only provided for any officer or servantin the Institution, who by wilful neglect or connivance permitted any patientto escape, being convicted and punished as for a felony, but made it asummary offence if an officer or servant allowed a patient to escape throughcarelessness.findings and recommendations regarding &apos;administrationPurpose of the Institution15. The two main functions of the Institution are detention and treat-ment. At one time detention was regarded as the primary function and treatment as a minor function, but during the 14 years of management bythe present Medical Superintendent, Dr. Hopwood, more and better treat-ment has been made available for patients. This change of attitude towardsthe needs of the mentally afflicted, instituted by Dr. Hopwood, has notresulted in any relaxation of the security rules, and no change has beenmade in this respect since the responsibility for the Institution passed to theBoard of Control in 1949.Security Aspect of the Institution16.   Secure  detention depends on a number of factors, the: mostimportant being the security of the premises and adequate supervision.   Thesecurity of the premises depends not only on seeing that every part of the
building is kept in a proper condition but also on effective routine precautionsin such matters as avoiding the deposit of coal or rubbish where they mightfacilitate the scaling of a wall, preventing access to ladders or other imple-ments, the locking of doors and the safe custody of keys. Many of thelocks in the Institution were installed many years ago and though no doubt the&apos;/it that could be obtained at the time, they are capable of being opened,as eWsliience has shown, by a key which can be made by an ingenious patient.Modern locks are much more secure and steps have been taken to change thelocks of the Institution. Constant watch must also be exercised to see thatpatients do not obtain material from visitors or maintenance staff which mayenable them to inflict harm on themselves or on others or to attempt anescape. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of watchfulness and close supervision by the nursing staff.17. In this connection we desire to emphasise that the security aspect of Broadmoor should never be depreciated and, while fully appreciating thegreat importance of treatment, we consider that Broadmoor cannot be regardedas comparable to an ordinary mental hospital in so far as security measures are concerned. One important difference is the increasing number of youngaggressive psychopaths with criminal propensities who have in recent years been certified insane and sent to Broadmoor from prisons. While the &apos;behaviour of these psychopaths may for prolonged periods be superficiallyexcellent under the sheltered conditions of Broadmoor, many of them are unlikely to respond permanently to treatment and therefore must alwaysrequire the most careful supervision to prevent their escape. At the sametime we wish to emphasise that there is no ground for thinking that the Boardof Control take a different view about security than did the Home Office.We reject the suggestion that has been made that the control of Broadmoorshould be returned to the Home Office, but we recommend that the Boardof Control should continue to ensure that the prime importance of securityis constantly brought to the attention of every person in any way concernedwith administration at Broadmoor.18. Hitherto, the senior medical officers have had prison experience.Although from some points of view it is an advantage that medical officers from mental hospitals should be appointed to Broadmoor, we think that itwill continue to be desirable that, save in very special circumstances, theMedical Superintendent and the Deputy Medical Superintendent should havehad either prison experience or experience in Broadmoor or one of the other two State Institutions, in order to make certain that the medical staff has a thorough appreciation of the importance of security measures.Lapses in Supervision19. Our examination of the circumstances of the escapes that have occurred in recent years indicates that there must have been carelessnesson the part of one or more persons in the Institution on a number of occasions.We do not necessarily imply that on any of these occasions there was suchcarelessness as would warrant a prosecution under the provisions of Section 12of the Criminal Lunatic Asylums Act, 1860, but there was a failure to exercisethat close supervision that ought to be exercised at Broadmoor.Staff Deficiencies20. We have accordingly made a close examination of the system tosee in what respects supervision can be improved. In our opinion the lapsesin supervision which we have noted above are due to staff shortages andto the fact that the present staff is not wholly of the quality that the needs
of Broadmoor make imperative. This deterioration in supervision will increase if steps are not taken to remedy these deficiencies. The present staff is19 below complement (paragraph 8) and there appears little likelihood under present circumstances of sufficient staff being recruited in the near future.21. We have found it impossible accurately to assess the number ofstaff required for the efficient running of the Institution but we are jgflpjedthat because of a number of factors (changes in hours of work, monPfreat-ment, &amp;c.) the deficiency is greater than that indicated in the preceding paragraph. Moreover we have referred (paragraph 8) to the fact that it hasbeen necessary to retain the services of 14 members of the male nursing staff who are over 60 years of age.22. We have been told that the staffing problem is one that is common to all mental hospitals and is due to conditions in the labour market. It isnot our concern to judge of the urgency of the problem as regards mental hospitals, but we are convinced of the urgency of the problem as regardsBroadmoor. The relative financial attraction that Broadmoor offered torecruits before the war as compared with the financial attraction of other occupations should be restored. It may be that this can be done by increasingthe &quot; lead&quot; in pay of Broadmoor nurses over those employed in ordinarymental hospitals. The existing &quot; lead &quot; of  40 (paragraph 10) is no longereffective by itself. We therefore recommend that sufficient increases insalaries should be made to attract suitable applicants for training as studentnurses at Broadmoor.23. The special conditions prevailing at Broadmoor lend force to the argument that the pay and conditions of service of the nursing staff shouldbe determined independently and should not be automatically linked withthose of the National Health Service.   We recommend accordingly.Rules of Conduct of the Institution24. The rules for the guidance of staff in a Broadmoor Institution mustof necessity be numerous, detailed and strict. We understand that the ruleswere last printed in 1908 and are now out of print. We think it important that the task of bringing them up to date should be expedited and that not only should every officer be in possession of a copy of these rules butthat junior officers especially should be regularly reminded of the importanceof the security rules. We therefore recommend that every member of thestaff should have a copy of the Security Rules.25. We have found evidence of misunderstanding on the part of thestaff of the policy and intention of the Board of Control. We recommendthat the Board should consider how it can secure a better unstanding of its policy on the part of the staff.26. Under the Lunacy Act, 1890, every patient in a mental hospitalhas the right to communicate direct with the Minister of Health and theBoard of Control among others. Criminal lunatics did not have this right,but. they had the right of communicating direct with the Council of Super-vision. This was a local body and in practice these communications were opened by the Council of Supervision in the presence of the MedicalSuperintendent. By the Broadmoor Institutions Rules, 1952 (S.I. 1952,No. 366), made by the Board of Control with the approval of the Ministerof Health, Broadmoor patients are entitled to communicate direct with theMinister or the Board of Control or any Commissioner of the Board. an ordinary prisoner cannot communicate with the Home Secretary except withthe knowledge of the Prison Governor and we think that there is substance
in the argument that Broadmoor patients should hot be able to communicate with higher authorities without the knowledge of the Medical Superintendent.The present system has been a cause of some dissatisfaction on the part ofthe staff and we recommend that patients&apos; communications with higherauthorities should be seen by the Medical Superintendent before transmission.Maintenance Staff27. We have referred in paragraph 11 to the large Ministry of Worksmaintenance staff. To facilitate their work a large number of trusted work-men have been given pass keys to enable them to move about inside theInstitution. Of the maintenance staff only the Resident Engineer and Foremanof Works have keys to enable them to get in and out of the Institution.Obviously the number of keys issued to workmen should be reduced to aminimum in the interests of security. The amount of traffic by maintenancepersonnel inside the Institution could be reduced by putting the works yardoutside the security wall and as this can be done without much structuralwork we recommend it. In the interests of security we also recommendthat all workmen who may come into contact with patients should be care-fully chosen and should receive regular instruction on the rules of security and that consideration should also be given to the desirability of providingthem with a distinctive type of overall.Patients&apos; Ordinary Clothes28. Inmates at. Broadmoor have been allowed to wear ordinary clothingsince 1880 and for many reasons it would be a retrograde step not to con-tinue this practice. When a patient is at work he wears distinctive workingclothes and his ordinary suit is kept in a box or a cupboard. We recommendthat in blocks where it appears desirable these cupboards and boxes shouldbe locked so that a patient cannot have access to his ordinary clothes withoutthe knowledge of a nurse.Changing of Locks29. We have referred in paragraph 16 to the changing of locks.We recommend that every effort be made to complete this change with theleast possible delay.PROCEDURE IN THE EVENT OF AN ESCAPE30. The escapes which have taken place in the last two years have hada profound effect on the people living in East Berkshire and neighbouringcounties and every possible step should be taken to allay the fears andinsecurity which many of these people justifiably feel. We hope and believethat if our recommendations are adopted those feelings will gradually fadethrough the virtual elimination of the possibility of an escape. There can beno absolute guarantee against an escape, however, and the public are entitledto effective measures to warn them of an escape. In addition, the measures designed for securing the recapture of an escaped patient should be improved.In these connections we make the following findings and recommendations: (i) There should be a distinctive siren or other audible warning whichshould be operated by the responsible officer on duty at Broadmooras soon as an escape has been detected. This should be coupledelectrically to an alarm in Wokingham Police Station. The siren willat the same time be a call for working parties to return, and to thestaff off duty to report at once to the Institution.
(ii) The Chief Constable of Berkshire has already a system of notifyingall necessary police stations and the police of Hampshire and&apos; Surrey.Military assistance and police dogs are available to him and he mustbe left to decide when and how these aids should be used.(iii) We suggest that the Chief Constable consult the Post Office with aview to devising machinery for warning schools of any escape^hichtakes place during school hours. We hope that arrangemefi&amp;e.:anbe made for these messages to be sent to schools and villag ePostOffices by telephone operators at the Telephone Exchanges when thepolice make the request.(iv) There is already machinery for the communication of urgent policemessages to the Press and the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion. We hope that in proper cases the British broadcasting corporation will give a degree of priority to the announcement ofan escape.(v) The Medical Superintendent and the Chief Constable of Berkshireshould work out a plan of co-operation between the Broadmoor staff and the police to be operated when an escape takes place. In thisconnection we should say that the public cannot be expected to under-stand the disposition of the police and nursing staff when an escapetakes place and we think that some criticisms made to us on thispoint were unjustified. But we think that there is no good reasonfor police and nurses not telling members of the public that searchis being made for an escaped inmate.(vi) We do not think that any system of automatic alarms to indicate when a patient scales a wall or goes through a door is practicable.(vii) Some system of notifying the public when a capture has been effectedwill have to be devised, but the methods to be used will have to vary according to the length of time that elapses between the escapeand the recapture.31.   Summary of Recommendations(a) The Board of Control should continue to ensure that the prime importance of security is constantly brought to the attention of every person in any way concerned with administration at Broadmoor (para-graph 17).(b) The Medical Superintendent and the Deputy Medical Superintendentshould, save in very special circumstances, have had either prisonexperience or experience in Broadmoor or one of the other two StateInstitutions (paragraph 18).(c) Sufficient increases in salaries should be made to attract suitableapplicants for training as student nurses at Broadmoor (paragraph 22).(d) The pay and conditions of service of the nursing staff should not automatically be linked with those of the National Health Service(paragraph 23).(e) Every member of the staff at Broadmoor should have a copy of theSecurity Rules (paragraph 24).(/) The Board of Control should consider how it can secure a better understanding of its policy on the part of the staff (paragraph 25).(g) Patients&apos; communications with higher authorities should be seen bythe Medical Superintendent before transmission (paragraph 26).(It) The works yard should be put outside the security wall of theInstitution (paragraph 27).(0 All workmen at Broadmoor who may come into contact with patientsshould be carefully chosen and should receive regular instruction on
the rules of security. The desirability of providing workmen with adistinctive type of overall should be considered (paragraph 27).0) In blocks where it appears desirable cupboards and boxes containingpatients&apos; ordinary clothes should be kept locked (paragraph 28).(M The installation of modern locks should be completed with the leastnOpossible delay (paragraph 29).v^There should be a distinctive siren or other audible warning whichshould be operated by the responsible officer on duty at Broadmooras soon as an escape has been detected. This should be coupledelectrically to an. alarm in Wokingham Police Station (paragraph30 (i)).On) The Chief Constable of Berkshire should consult the Post Officeauthorities with a view to devising machinery for warning schoolsof any escape which takes place during school hours (para-graph 30 (hi)).(n) In proper cases the British Broadcasting Corporation should be askedto give priority to the announcement of an escape (paragraph 30 (iv)).(o) The Medical Superintendent of Broadmoor and the Chief Constableof Berkshire should work out a plan of co-operation between the staffof the Institution and the police to be operated when an escape takes place (paragraph 30 (v)).. 32. In conclusion, we should like to express appreciation of the services rendered to us by Mr. A. Forbes of the Ministry of Health, who was appointedto act as our Secretary, and Miss M. E. Gaffney of the Ministry of Health,who was appointed to act as our Assistant Secretary. They have eased ourtasks by making arrangements for our meetings and for our examination of witnesses and by obtaining information for us from official and other sources.Finally, they have been of great assistance to us in the drafting and considera-tion of this Report.J.

The growing number of escapes since the war from inside the walls ofprisons led the Commissioners to call for an effort to re-establish the oldstandards of security. These had insensibly lapsed during the war, and though the conditions could hardly have been worse for the attempt, we felt it to be our duty to the public, as well as to our own professional standards,to make it. Unfortunate as it is that a system which aims to be one of constructive training should be cluttered up with searches and checks, lockingsand unlockings, security must remain one of the foundations on which such asystem has to be built. Loss of liberty being the essence of the prisonerspunishment, we must make sure that he suffers at any rate that; and wecannot even train him if we have not got him.   One result in many prisons* Of the organisations and persons named above, those starred submitted writtenmemoranda also,
was a further reduction of workshop hours to enable the staff to give timeto searching, though this could be avoided with an adequate staff.6.

In our Report for 1947 we drew attention to the number of escapesin post-war years, and,the effort which was being made to re-establish theformer standards of security. We are glad to be able to report a steadyimprovement: the number of escapes from secure conditions in 1950 was lessthan half the average of the preceding five years.The numbers of escapes from security conditions in pre-war and post-war years were as follows: Proportion toDaily Average .

ts8.        I mentioned in answer to a Question in the House on 19th June thatfehe report had been received and I think it desirable that it should be published,and the Governments views on it made known, with as little delay as possible.I should therefore like to have authority to make the proposed statement after questions on Thursday next, 26th June.   Copies of the report can be madeavailable in the Vote Office that afternoon.I.M,Ministry of Health, W. 1.21st JUNE, 1952.appendix draft statement i have today presented to Parliament the report of the Committee,under Mr. Scott Henderson, which was set up after the escape of Straffen fromBroadmoor on 29th April last and which was charged to inquire into the adequacy of the security arrangements at the Institution.The Committee make a number of detailed recommendations wherebythey think that the existing arrangements could be improved,   I wish to say at once that, while some of these recommendations will involve further consultation with other authorities and bodies concerned, the Government do not hesitate to accept all the recommendations in principle and will proceed withoutdelay towards their implementation.   They are gratefu?. to the Committee forthe speed and thoroughness with which they have carried out their task.In view of the many rumours and speculations which have beenprovoked by the circumstances of this particular escape, the House will -I am sure - be on the whole reassured both by the general tenor of the Committee&apos;sreport and by the Governments clear intention to accept all their detailedre commendations.The House will note that the Committee found that there had been no relaxation of security rules since the management of Broadmoor passed to the Board of Control in 1949.
