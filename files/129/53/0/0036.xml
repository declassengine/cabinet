Printed for the Cabinet. July 1952SECRETCopy No. 63C. (52) 23611th July, 1952CABINET CFfiCRECORD COPYCABINETPROPOSED NEW HOTEL IN london memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI invite my colleagues to approve the grant of a building licence, for some 1,800,000, for the erection of a new first-class hotel in Portman Square. If this were agreed, I would propose the starting date should be as soon after1st November next as possible.2. This proposal was considered on 2nd July by the Economic PolicyCommittee, which had before them my memorandum E.A. (52) 84. The Com-mittee thought there was a strong case on economic grounds for the proposal.The hotel would be built mainly by British capital and managed by an Americanoperating company. The promoters and the Export Credits Guarantee Depart-ment have for a long time been in close touch, and the Department is nowsatisfied that (subject to satisfaction of its normal underwriting criteria) there isscope in the proposals for a joint venture guarantee to be underwritten on acommercial basis. It is understood that the American operating company wouldprovide the quantities of steel required from Belgium, as part of its contributionto the capital of the venture, and no building licence would be granted unless thecompany were prepared to do so. The expenditure of dollar visitors while stayingin the hotel would be large and has been estimated at about  2 million a year,whereas the dollar outgoings of the hotel would not amount to more than  200,000annually. It is estimated that some three-quarters of the earnings would be new business since, except during the winter months, there is not sufficient good hotel accommodation in London for Americans to stay here. These estimates do not take account of the further sums which the new dollar visitors would spend duringthe remainder of their stay elsewhere in this country. The project would, there-fore, substantially increase our dollar earnings from the tourist trade. We must do all we can to encourage this tourist trade which last year earned us  22 million in dollars, since, unlike most manufactures for export, it is capable of greatexpansion without heavy additional running demands on labour and raw materials.The project could be undertaken within the 1953 investment programme limits Ihave proposed for my Department.3. While, as I have said above, my colleagues on the Committee thought thatthe case for the new hotel had been fully established on economic grounds, they invited me to bring the matter before the Cabinet in view of possible political criticism. This might take the shape of arguing that the housing programme would be affected adversely; or it might be argued that it was inconsistent toauthorise the building of a large new hotel in London while at the same time thereis a proposal to allow the Mayfair Hotel in Berkeley Street to be turned intooffices.4. On the first point, the Economic Policy Committee recognised that theeffect on the housing programme would be very slight and that any criticism of thiskind could be met on the ground that any measures designed to assist the balanceof payments problem must have priority. The situation regarding the MayfairHotel is that an application has been made by the owners of the Mayfair for42546
permission for change of user. This matter is now before the Minister of housing and Local Government. If the Minister, in the exercise of his quasi-judicialfunction, decides to allow a change of user, that strengthens rather than weakensthe case for the proposed new hotel, since the loss of accommodation represented by the Mayfair exacerbates still further the serious accommodation problem inLondon. If, on the other hand, a change of user is refused, there will still be a need for more hotel accommodation, so that either way there is a case for building a new hotel in London.5. I commend this project strongly. Not only will it substantially increase our dollar earnings, but will give tangible evidence to influential and vocal interestsin the United States that we are prepared to act with determination and imaginationin trying to solve our balance of payments problem.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,11th July, 1952.
