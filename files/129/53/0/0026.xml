THE GREAT DEBATE:   FINANCIAL ANDECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal GovernmentPart I.   &quot;The Bankers&apos; Ramp&quot;The authority of the City, and particularly of the Bank of England,must always be great.2, Yet the most tender critic of the financial and economic policiesproposed by successive Governors could scarcely maintain that the Bank hasalways given wise advice to the Government of the day.3. Lord Cunliffe&apos;s estimate of the capacity of Germany to payreparations;  the advice of Mr. Montagu Norman given to the Chancellor of theExchequer of the day to return to gold at a parity of 34. 86 to the  1;  the longdeflationary policy which caused a wave of emotional ill-feeling among theworking classes against the capitalist class not yet expended;  the events of1931, and the apparent concession to American banking opinion of the standards of the unemployed; finally, the ill-advised return to convertibility in 1947 -all these raise at least doubts in many minds.4. While all sensible people must respect the authority, few can accept the dogma of the infallibility of &quot;the world of Banking and Finance&quot;.Part II.   &quot;The Housing Cut&quot;5, It is suggested that housing must be offered upon the altar ofsacrifice.   Not only must housing be cut, but it must be known and publiclyproclaimed to have been cut.   It is said that this humiliating gesture will increase confidence.   It will bring comfort to the acute speculators of Brusselsand Zurich,   But at what a cost.6. I have already started an investigation to see what timing of timber purchases can be made in order to help the balance of payments in thesecond half of this year.   This is a practical and sensible way to help.   but any retardation of purchases must be such as to allow the housing programme tobe kept going at full steam (if necessary out of stocks).   It may,&quot;perhaps, bepossible to make further purchases in December of this year or, at the worst,in April of next year if things improve.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.....C.(52) 2264TH JULY, 1952CABINET
I hope that, even, if it is found possible to retard the import of timber, it will not be publicly announced.   Such an announcement would not help the economy.   It will merely throw doubt on the future housing programme.It would not transfer building capacity elsewhere.   It would merely slow upproduction.   The mere whisper of it would cause a fall in productivity,   ftwould be a policy of more cups of tea and less building&apos;.8. Still less can I agree to any action to slow down the programme for 195? and 1953,   We must complete 230,000 houses in 1952 and 260,000 houses in 1953,   All this is arranged.   To achieve this programme, some of the houses are already starting;  some are in various stages of construction;  for othersthe tenders are arranged.   To stop would benefit nobody and injure us greatly.Nor can I agree to any financial &quot;ceiling&quot; calculated to reduce this programme.There is no purpose in such a ceiling.   I think that any intellectual faith inthis so-called Capital Investment Programme is now more or less abandoned.At several meetings of Ministers no one has seriously supported it.9. Meanwhile, we are trying to find substitutes for timber.We must be allowed to use our ingenuity.   This experimental work is already begun.   The first designs of a &quot;timber-saving house&quot; (as it is formally named -I call it &quot;the boneless wonder&quot;) are on the way.   We may fail.   But we must atleast have a chance to succeed, if we can.10. The other main materials for housing except timber, viz.,bricks and cement, can be pushed up in this country without injury to anyone.The steel can be used more intelligently and economically.   The Minister ofWorks and I have circulated a note to the Economic Policy Committee on all this.The statement that coal now used for brick making could be shipped abroad isincorrect.   Such coal is of a quality and character as to make it unsuitable forexport.11. So much for housing.Part III.   &quot;The Grand Design&quot;12. With regard to the great question with which we are againconfronted - that is to say the future of sterling - I would venture these comments.As an objective, convertibility is, of course, right.  A currency in which halfthe world trades cannot do its full duty unless and until it becomes convertible.But the timing is vital.     Any such proposal must spring and be seen to springfrom strength and not from weakness.   It must be the coping-stone of a policyand not the sign of a retreat.   To act now, and to try to support such action,by widely advertised reductions in armaments and housing and social policiesseem to me very dangerous.   It is playing the old bankers&apos; game.   It is the same thing we were asked to do in 1931.   It will advertise not our strength but ourweakness.13. Convertibility should be the culminating point of the grand designwhen Britain is set upon a new and upward path.   It should not be risked at a mount of apparent decline,14. Such a policy of development and renaissance 1 have tried tooutline in my paper of 17th June (C. (52) 196).   I am indeed glad to see the references to Commonwealth economic policy in the Chancellor of theExchequer^ paper (C. (52) 223).
15I would suggest that we take the following decisions.(a) Draw up, in simple language and in brief terms, a draft plan of what it is we want the Commonwealth countries to agree to both in the realm of money, currency management, etc. , and inthe realm of trading agreements, tariffs, G.A.T.T., and allthat depends thereon and in the realm of development plans.(b) Ministers having agreed this as their broad plan to put before the november Conference should despatch some of their number(with a small but skilled, staff drawn partly from the CivilService, partly from merchant banking and partly from industry)on this imperial mission. . It should be their duty to make thepreliminary soundings and to direct the official researches intothe right channels.   The November Conference will only succeedif, before it starts, we have &quot;sold&quot; them the conclusions at whichwe hope it will arrive.16. The November Conference is our only way out.   It is ceriainlyour only Conservative way out.   Everything should be staked upon it.Nothing, at any rate, should be done which might jeopardise its success.   the broad basis of agreement must be planned now;  and this should be the duty ofBritish Ministers, both at home and by personal contact,   I cannot believe thatany radical monetary plan now would help towards a success in November.   for it must prejudge the main issue.   For any plan must involve a unilateral freeingof current sterling based on a unilateral freezing of other people*s legitimatelysaved balances.   Strange prelude to the new Imperial policy,17. Meanwhile, our Imperial policy should not be hidden under abushel;  it should be widely proclaimed in England and overseas.   Theknowledge that Britain is setting about this constructive and ambitious plan will, I think, give more security to sterling than a policy confined to cuts andrestrictions of productivity to artificially planned limits.   At the same time itmay well be that during this period some necessary cuts in imports must bemade to gain the necessary time.   But such a policy cannot hope to succeedif it appears to our people as yet another in a long series of sacrificesimposed by events.   It must be, and be seen to be, a plan of conserving our strength of action;  of crouching, before the bold leap forward to our destiny.H.
