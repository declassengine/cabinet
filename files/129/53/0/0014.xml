(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (52) 214 COPY NO.25th JUNE, 1952.CABINETAIRCRAFT FOR NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY FORCES:OFFSHORE PURCHASES BY THE UNITED STATES IN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The United States Administration has announced that it will make off&quot;shore purchases of complete aircraft for the forces of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O. ) as part of an integrated plan, to be prepared byN.A.T.O., and if producing countries also offer a substantial measure ofadditional production on their own behalf and with their own finances.   The amountof American expenditure will probably depend on the attractiveness of the offers; figures of ^400 millions and $700 millions have been mentioned.  after discussion between the Ministers primarily concerned, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, we submitted to the N.A.T.O. Staff the attached offer to be included in the integrated plan.   The total value of the aircraft we have offered to supply would be over ^150 millions, delivery and payment beingspread over 1952/3 - 1955/6.2.        We know that the bid put in by theDutch could not be carried out withinthe time stipulated.   We also know that the Italian bid is likely to be lesseconomic than ours, but to be politically attractive on the grounds that it will help to resuscitate the Italian aircraft industry.   The French show signs ofjustifying their bid on political and general economic grounds rather than onthe merit of their production.   We are likely to be criticised in N.A.T.O. forasking for so much particularly as we have hitherto claimed to be fullyextended.   There seems no hope of the N.A.T.O. Council reaching agreement and it is probable that they will refer the plan, possibly with comments but without firm recommendations, to the American Administration and that theissue will finally be settled in Washington.3.        On making our offer in N.A.T.O. we were asked to explain firsthow it was that we could now make this offer of aircraft and second what effect the re-arrangement of our production programme would have on our existingN.A.T.O. obligations.   So far we have argued that we are revising our production programme of the latest type of bombers and that because of our economic position we have to stimulate exports as much as possible so that capacity not fully occupied on military aircraft production will probably have to be devotedto other export goods and cannot easily be recovered.4.        I have come to the conclusion that the tactics most likely to secureNisa substantial order will be to make it quite clear that unless there is anoff-shore purchase the aircraft will not be produced here at all.   Anythingshort of this will lead the americans to place the orders elsewhere and hopethat we shall nevertheless maintain our full programme.   I therefore considerthat we should now say this quite frankly to the Americans.   We would explain that we are able to make this offer partly because of changes in our production programme by which we can make capacity available for these aircraft which
forwould otherwise have been used for less efficient types and partly because the^balance of payments demands a greater foreign exchange contribution from the^sources of this industry.   We would say that we are not asking for our shareTn these contracts on grounds of need alone but also in the interests of N.A.T.O.because production in this country will be better, quicker and cheaper than inEurope.   If discussions in Paris before the issue is transferred to Washingtonforce us to say something of the above, it should be as little as possible.   Weshould explain, if asked again, that we cannot yet assess the extent to whichall this may affect our N.A.T.O. obligations;  this will become apparent when we send in our answers under the N.A.T.O. Review.   Bearing in mind that the americans&apos; offer was designed to fill a given gap in the N.A.T.O. programme and that our own reduction will increase that gap, we must recognise that what we say may produce violent repercussions in Paris.   That is a risk whichhas to be faced;  there are limits to the extent to which we can skate over thefacts because of the detailed information about our present plans possessed by the international staff.5.        I understand that the French have already sent a senior officer overto Washington to make their case.   We ought not to allow ourselves to loseground.   I therefore propose that arrangements be made forthwith to present our case to the U. i Administration.   I hope also to be able to mention it toMr. Dean Acheson while he is over here.6.        In conclusion, therefore, I recommend that:-(a) we should make it clear to the Americans that unless we secureoff-shore purchase for the aircraft included in our offer we shall be unable to produce the aircraft at all.   We should explain that we are ableto produce them partly because of a revision of our production programme and partly because of a review of our defence programme onaccount of the balance of payments.   Essentially we must make itclear that the production in this country will be better, quicker andcheaper than in Europe.   This should be put in hand in Washingtonforthwith.(b) .if something has to be said in Paris it should be as little aspossible and we should explain, if necessary, that the effect of changes in the production programme will be made clear in theN.A.T.O. Review.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.25th JUNE, 1952.
This note briefly summarises the proposals put before theInternational Staff on 21st June by the United Kingdom Delegation.2. The United Kingdom Delegation explained orally the developments which now made it possible for the United Kingdom to make certain offers   of productive capacity.   These offers were as follows:-(a) SwiftsThe United Kingdom offers to produce 720 Swift aircraft additional to the 156 on order for the Royal Air Force and of these to pay for200 itself, provided that 520 are placed on order in the UnitedKingdom under off-shore purchase arrangements.(b) CanberraThe United Kingdom Delegation explained that in the changed circumstances referred to it was -asfc&apos; able to offer substantialcapacity for the manufacture of Canberras for N.A.T.O.(c) VenomIt was explained that a considerable amount of what may becomeredundant capacity could be placed at the disposal of the off-shorepurchase authorities in order to reduce N.A.T.O. deficiencies for this type of aircraft in the AWF role.(d) Jet TrainersIt was explained that the United Kingdom has capacity immediately available to supply N.A.T.O. requirements for either single-engined ortwin-engined Jet Trainers quickly and cheaply.(e) GA 5The United Kingdom Delegation gave details of capacity not yet taken up for the production of the 200 aircraft now on order for the RoyalAir Force. Tt was stated that the question of this capacity mustbe the subject of negotiations between Governments but the UnitedKingdom Delegates would attempt to supply more specific statementsearly next week.3. The United Kingdom Delegation gave details of the cost of aircraft inthe above categories as produced in the United Kingdom.PROPOSED OFF-SHORE PROCUREMENT OF AIRCRAFT:UNITED KINGDOM OFFER.
APPENDIX TO UNITED KINGDOM note the United Kingdom Delegation gave the following estimates of thecost of United Kingdom aircraft in the categories referred to on the basis oforders of the size mentioned:I   SWIFTS(a) The cost of each aircraft fully equipped (but without spares) is 57,000.   The cost of 500 would be  28,500,000.(b) Spare engines for 500 aircraft on the basis of 30% backing of spareengines would cost 150 x  16,500 -  2,475,000.(c) Spares and spare equipment backing at 15% for a total of 500aircraft would cost  4,275,000.II VENOMS(a) The cost of the Venom NF 2 equipped (but without spares) is 43,500.   This figure of  43,500 includes  6,800 for equipment.The cost of 400 would be  17,320,000.(b) Spare engines on the basis of 30% spares backing for 400 aircraft would cost 120 x  9,300 =  1,116,000.(c) Spares and equipment backing at 15% for 400 aircraft would cost  2,598,000.III METEOR TRAINER(a) The cost of the Meteor Trainer equipped is  25,500.(b) The cost of the spare engines would be  3,300 each.(c) The cost of spares and equipment backing depends on the numberordered.IV VAMPIRE TRAINER(a) The cost of the Vampire Trainer equipped is  30,300.(b) The cost of spare engines would be  5,200 each.(c) The cost of spares and equipment depends on the numberordered.V GA. 5(a)   As production of the GA. 5 is only just now being put in hand,figures of cost are necessarily very tentative.   It is estimated,however, that on the basis of  13,500 for equipment, the costof the aircraft equipped but without spares would be between 90,000 and  100,000 each.
