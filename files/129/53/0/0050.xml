(52) 25021st July, 1952CABINET OFFlCfcRECORD COPYCABINETKOREA: APPOINTMENT OF A DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TO THEUNITED NATIONS COMMANDERThe following draft has been prepared by the Ministry of Defence on theproposed appointment of a Deputy Chief of Staff to the United Nations commander in Korea.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,21st July, 1952.On 1st July I informed the House that, at the request, of the United NationsCommander, General Clark a request which was subsequently agreed to by theUnited States Government an officer from the Commonwealth is to be appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff at General Clark&apos;s Headquarters with duties in connectionwith operations in Korea, The request was for an officer drawn from one ofthe Commonwealth countries providing combatant forces in Korea, and it has beenagreed with the Governments&quot; of those countries that the post should be filled bya senior United Kingdom officer. The officer selected after consultation withthe Commonwealth Governments is Major-General S. N. Shoosmith, now com-manding the East Anglian District in the United Kingdom.Note by the Prime MinisterW. S. C.
I should like to make it quite clear to the House that General ShooMSthwill be in all respects an ordinary member of General Clark&apos;s Staff with responsi-bility solely to him. Neither consultation nor information are involved in theappointment except in so far as the United Nations Commander desires. by making this officer available Her Majesty&apos;s Government accept no more respon-sibility for the conduct of operations than they have at present as a member of theUnited Nations who have entrusted the United States Government with the conducton their behalf of the Korean operations. In order that there may be no mis-understanding on this point I will read to the House the text of the instructions which are being issued to General Shoosmith.&quot; You have been appointed to the staff of the United Nations commander in Korea in the capacity of Deputy Chief of Staff. You will carry out all theduties associated with such an appointment and you will be responsible to theUnited Nations Commander and his Chief of Staff.&quot; You are not the channel for passing the views of the United KingdomChiefs of Staff to the United Nations Commander. This will continue to bedone through the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington.&quot; You will not pass on any information which you may receive from theUnited Nations Commander or his staff, without the authority of the united nations Commander.&quot; These instructions have been agreed with the Chiefs of Staff of Canada,Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.&quot;There can be only one channel for consultation about Korea and that is between our representatives in Washington and the United States Governmentand Military Authorities there. There will no doubt be many occasions on whichinformal consultation between General Clark and his Deputy Chief of Staff willbe fruitful. I want to make it clear that we do not seek, in making this appoint-ment, to trench in any way upon the undivided responsibility of General Clarkfor the task with which he has been entrusted by the United States Government,nor do we seek to set up a channel of communication on important matters ofpolicy by-passing Washington. The position as I have explained it to the Houserepresents the considered views of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments in the other commonwealth countries concerned, and is fully understood by the United states authorities.It is, of course, necessary for us to be kept informed of the progress of operations and of the many technical military questions which arise in the course of the dailywork of Her Majesty&apos;s forces in Korea. All this liaison work will continue to becarried out by the Chiefs of Staffs representative accredited to General Clark&apos;headquarters. All other Governments whose forces are engaged in Korea haveliaison sections at Headquarters in Tokyo and these arrangements will not bedisturbed in any way by the new appointment which is beins made to GeneralClark&apos;s Staff.  &apos;       &apos;
