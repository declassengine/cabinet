(THIS DC^lpJME-NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 2339th JULY, 1952.THE NATIONAL DIETNote by the Lord President of the council I was concerned to read the paper circulated by the Minister ofFood (C. (52) 200) about the adequacy of the national diet and calling attentionto the increasing risk of impairing the health and working efficiency of thepeople which would result from a further reduction in food supplies.I feel it my duty to record the following points made to me bySir Harold Himsworth, the Secretary of the Medical Research Council, with whom I discussed this question:-CABINET OFFICtRECORD copy copy NO.vfX JCABINET(a) To preserve health and working efficiency of the populationrequires an average food intake of 2,900 calories per head per day.(b) Even with this intake, some 80 to 85% of the food eaten is requiredto keep the body alive and to cover the process of living outside normalproductive work.   This leaves only 20% to 15% of the energy intake availablefor use at the job;  and if food intake is reduced it is on the energy availablefor such work that any reduction first falls.(c) Consequently a reduction in food intake which appears small inrelation to total food calories consumed may constitute a considerable proportion of the calories available for productive work.(d) At first sight, one might expect that if meat, cheese, fat and other&quot;palatable&quot; foods were reduced people would make up the right total of caloriesby eating more bread, potatoes, etc.   But Sir Harold Himsworth states that thereis considerable experience to the contrary.   In other words the more we reducethe &quot;palatable&quot; foods, the more the general intake of calories is likely to go down.(e) The Minister of Food&apos;s paper shows that even now, the daily calorieintake for 1952 is only estimated at 2,830.   Any further food cuts will reducethe average still further and although it is not possible to state definitely thatproductive work would be adversely affected, there is no doubt that such areduction would involve a risk of lowering the nation&apos;s productive effort.W.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.9th JULY, 1952.
