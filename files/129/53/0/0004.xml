(52) 41st Conclusions, Minute 3 (1)-the Cabinet approved the policy for road haulage and for the reorganisation of the railways set out inC. (52) 110 and announced in the White Paper published on 8th May; and authorised the Minister of Transport, in consultation with me, to prepare a Bill to give effectto that policy. On 19th May the Prime Minister appointed a Committee under my Chairmanship, consisting of the Home Secretary, the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of State for economic affairs, to assist the Minister of Transport in the preparation of the Bill and itsconduct in Parliament.2. A Bill has been drafted accordingly under the guidance of the Committee,and I submit a copy (print No. 163-5) herewith for the consideration of mycolleagues. The Bill embodies the policy set out in the White Paper. It requires the British Transport Commission to dispose of the assets of the Road haulage executive in association with a Road Haulage Disposal Board. The assets are tobe sold as operable units (called &quot; transport units &quot;), carrying a five years&apos; &quot; A &quot;licence. It provides for the establishment of a Transport Fund to be fed from the proceeds of a levy on road goods vehicles, out of which the Commission would be compensated for losses arising from the disposal of their road haulage undertaking,and for net losses arising from the diversion of traffic from rail to road. The Billalso provides for the reorganisation of the railways, and for amendments as to theconstitution of the British Transport Commission and their general functions. Inthe matter of charges schemes, greater latitude is to be given to the Commission toenable the railways to quote rates competitive with road haulage (see also para-graph 11 below). Provision is also made for the Commission to meet increasingcosts by limited increases of charges subject to subsequent approval by the transport tribunal, and subject to the overriding powers of the Minister.3. In the course of drafting the Bill questions have arisen on which the policy had necessarily not been fully laid down in the White Paper, or in the discussionsleading up to its issue. The Committee have taken decisions on these questions andit is with these questions and the decisions on them that the remainder of thismemorandum is mainly concerned. We may find it necessary to suggest someamendments to the Bill before it is presented to Parliament, in the light of consul-tations with the interests mainly affected, in particular the British transport commission. The Commission have, however, already shown that they areprepared to co-operate in giving effect to the Governments broad policy.Railway Interests in Road Transport4.   The earlier view was that, apart from providing necessary feeder services,the railways ought not to be permitted to enter the road haulage business bypurchasing assets of the Road Haulage Executive.   We now think, however, that,42439 bSECRETC. (52) 20419th June, 1952
in addition to such services, the railways ought, if they wish, to be able to provideboth passenger and goods services by road in substitution for a branch line closed down to secure economy, and further that  the Bill ought not to be so narrowlydrawn as to prevent the railways from providing some small road service if it fittedthe existing transport pattern for them to do so. The Bill, while placing no dutyon the Commission to provide road services Clause 22 (/)-preserves their powersto carry goods and passengers by road Clause 1 (4) and enables them, with theconsent of the Minister, to retain assets of the Road Haulage Executive if this isnecessary to maintain the efficiency of other parts of their undertaking Clause 5 (3).5. Before nationalisation the railway companies controlled, through share-holding, road goods transport undertakings, including Pickfords and CarterPatersons, Ltd., which owned some 3,500 vehicles. There are objections to therailways directly operating road goods transport. But just because the road haulage Executive^ assets are being disposed of, there is no reason why the railways should not, if they wish, retain an interest in road goods transport to the same extent, and in the same way, as before nationalisation. A provision has, therefore,been included in the Bill Clause 4 enabling assets of the Road Haulage Executive,which would otherwise have been offered for public sale as transport units, to betransferred by the Commission to companies promoted by them for that purpose.The vehicles so transferred would not exceed the equivalent in numbers, type andsize of the vehicles held by railway-controlled road haulage undertakings beforenationalisation.The 25-Mile Limit6. The Bill provides Clause 7- that the-25-mile limit shall be abolished ona date to be appointed by the Minister. Clause 7 (2) (b) provides that this shall notbe done before the Minister considers that there is no further reasonable prospectof the assets of the Road Haulage Executive being disposed of as operable units;thereafter they might be sold as chattels without the right to an &quot; A &quot; licence. TheCommittee have considered whether the Bill should not fix a date for the abolitionof the 25-mile limit, but to do this would tempt buyers to hold off in the hope of buying more cheaply later, and would remove the power of the Minister to control the disposal process in the light of the circumstances. Our general view is that theBill as drafted maintains the best possible balance.Relaxation of the Licensing System &apos;7. Clause 8 amends the grounds on which the licensing authorities are togrant or refuse carriers&apos; licences, by permitting the authorities to take into accountcharges made for services. At present they can do this only if the charges are so high that the traffic does not pass at all. Further, under the present system itis for the applicant, when faced with objections from providers of existing services including the railways, to prove that those services are not adequate for the needsof trade and industry. Under the provisions in Clause 8, it will be for the objectorto prove that the existing &quot;services are as good as, or better than, those which theapplicant proposes to provide. As a sanction against hauliers who obtain a licence. by undertaking to provide better or cheaper services and then do not live up totheir promises subsection (3) of Clause 8 provides that, where such undertakings,are not carried out, the licensing authority may revoke or suspend the licence.     ;The Transport Levy8. This is dealt with in Clause 10 arid the Second Schedule. In order that,in pursuance of the White Paper, vehicles engaged mainly on narrowly localdelivery services should not be subject to the levy, the Second Schedule providesthat this shall not be chargeable on goods vehicles, the unladen weight of which doesnot exceed .1 ton. Above that level, the levy is strictly proportional to the unladen weight of the vehicle. It had been suggested that a higher rate of levy might becharged on the heavier vehicles because of their disproportionately greater earning capacity. But this would unduly penalise the heavier vehicles because of theirgreater efficiency. On the Second Schedule as it stands, the scale for an initial levyof  4 million a year (as announced in the White Paper) will range from  3 Is. 6d:a vehicle to rather more than  30: over 90 per cent, of the vehicles subject to the levy will be assessed at less than  10 each. . -j:
Charges Schemes11. Clause 19 is designed (in accordance with paragraph 14 of the white paper) to ensure that greater latitude is given to the Commission in charges schemes to vary their charges, so as to enable the railways to quote rates competitive withroad transport. The schemes are required to provide for maximum charges, belowwhich it will be open to the Commission to quote. The schemes are also required Clause 19 (2) (d) to contain provisions for preventing the commission from making &quot;unduly low &quot; charges. Where other providers of transport thinkthat unduly low charges will not be adequately prevented in this way, they have aright of objection to the Transport Tribunal Clause 19 (5) and the Third Schedule.The Commission do not like this, and we ourselves have our doubts about theClause in its present form. It would be unfair if the railways with their greatfinancial resources, could resort in particular localities to deliberate undercuttingdesigned to kill competition. On the other hand, a Bill with the object of improvingand cheapening transport generally ought not to appear to prohibit reductions in charges. We propose to give further thought to the matter, but in the meantimeI feel bound to draw the attention of my colleagues to it.Duties and Composition of the Commission12. The duties of the Commission are re-defined in Clause 22 (1). They areno longer to have the duty of providing.&quot; an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities withinGreat Britain.&quot; In future they are to be responsible for providing railway services for Great Britain, and for providing a co-ordinated system of passenger transport for London and such other transport and canal facilities as they thinkexpedient. As to port facilities, they are restricted to the ports where they are atpresent operating. While the autonomous regional railway authorities would beresponsible for running the railways, the Commission would be responsible forbroad transport policy. This being so, it is desirable that the Bill should indicatethat appointments to the Commission should be made on a basis which, whileproviding for the adequate inclusion of persons with experience in. the mariage-ment of railway and road transport both of passengers and of goods, should ,also include persons with experience of the transport requirements of agriculture,commerce and industry. It is the experience of Departments concerned with other nationalised industries that there are disadvantages in including on the centralcontrolling authority persons specifically selected to represenrparticuiar interests.42439 b 2Losses Due to Transfer of Traffic from Rail to Road9. Clause 13 provides that, in order to enable him to decide the amount whichshould be paidto the railways from the Transport Fund in respect of losses due tothe transfer of traffic from rail to road, the Minister should obtain an estimate ofsuch losses from the permanent members of the Transport Tribunal. Under sub-section (4) of Clause 13, however, the Minister has power to reduce the estimate(and hence the amount to be paid to the railways in respect of these losses) if, in hisopinion, the Tribunal have not made sufficient allowance for economies which therailways might have made as a result of the loss of traffic to road.Re-organisation of the Railways ..   ;. &quot;&quot;10. Clause 15 provides that, within twelve months of the passing of the Act,the Commission shall prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the re-organisation of the railways. The scheme-making powers embodied in the Clauseare very wide and would permit the setting up of largely autonomous regionalrailway authorities. Under subsection (7), however, the general financial controland control over charges is reserved to the Commission. Subsection (81 providesthat there shall be a separate authority for the whole of Scotland, but such an authority would be responsible to the Commission. The Committee are satisfiedthat Scottish railways must continue to form part of the Commission^ system andthat it would be impracticable to go further than do the provisions of the Clause inthe direction of separation. Clause 16 provides that, before approving that partof the Commission^ scheme which relates to Scotland, the Minister should consult the Secretary of State for Scotland,-and this should make it abundantly clear thatpeculiarly Scottish interests will receive full consideration.
This, besides increasing the difficulties of finding suitable persons, tends to makeit difficult for the body to work as a team. The provisions of subsection (2) of clause 22 have been drawn accordingly.The Ministers Powers of Direction13. Subsection (3) of Clause 22 extends the Ministers powers to give directions to the Commission. At present his powers are limited to the issue of directions of a general character &quot; in relation to matters which appear to him to affect the national interest.&quot; These powers have proved sufficient in respect of charges to be made by the Commission; but experience has shown that they arenot wide enough to ensure that the Minister can intervene in other matters which,though they cannot be said to affect the national interest because their effectsmay be local in character, are nevertheless, of sufficient general importance to warrant intervention. The amendment to Section 4 (1) of the Transport Act, 1947,which is contained in Clause 22 (3) of the Bill is designed to enable the Minister to intervene in such cases, and at the same time to avoid becoming involved in mattersof day-to-day administration and thus bringing such matters within the scope ofParliamentary review.Credit Facilities14. The possibility of providing financial assistance to purchasers of transportunits is under consideration. It is desirable that, if at all possible, such assistance should be limited to the facilitating of credit to be made available privately.Proposals are awaited from the Road Haulage Association, who may be preparedto set up a separate credit organisation whose sole purpose would be to assist thepurchasers. In that event, the banks can be authorised to provide the necessary funds without any serious breach of the Government^ credit policy, and no provision need be made in the Bill.Incorporation of the Workers&apos; Charter15. Consideration has been given to the possibility of including in the Billprovisions on the lines of those included in the Iron and Steel Bill for the super-vision of the arrangements for the promotion of safety, health and welfare ofpersons employed in the non-nationalised part of the transport industry. unlike the denationalised iron and steel industry, however, non-nationalised transport will have no central body which could supervise such arrangements. The road and Rail Traffic Act,, 1933, makes certain provisions with the object of securingsafety relating to the hours of work and rest periods of drivers and the roadworthi-ness of vehicles. To go beyond this in respect of vehicles purchased on disposalof the Road Haulage Executive does not seem to be practicable. The matter is,however, being examined by the Minister of Labour.Conclusion16. I ask my colleagues to approve the draft Bill circulated with. thismemorandum and, subject to any further amendments which may be necessaryin the light of the consultations now taking place, and to any minor or drafting amendments, to agree to its presentation in the House of Commons on Thursday,3rd July, 1952, as proposed in C.
