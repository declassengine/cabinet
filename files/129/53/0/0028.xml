Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 2287th July, 1952CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947: AMENDMENT OFFINANCIAL PROVISIONSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government we have got to decide what we are going to do about the financial provisionsof the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947; and we have got to decide this very quickly. It seems clear that some amendment is necessary. Our problem is todecide what line the amendment should take.2. The reasons why some amendment is considered necessary, the possible alternatives, and my proposals (which I call a Limited Compensation Scheme), are set out in my memorandum H.A. (52) 79, which has been considered both by theCommittee on Development Charges and by the Home Affairs Committee(H.A. (52) 15th, 16th and 17th Meetings). I have now been invited by the formerCommittee to put forward my proposals to the Cabinet, indicating the difficultieswhich have been discussed.3.   My scheme very briefly is (i) to retain the limited compensation settlement effected by the 1947 Actand to pay the compensation only as and when damage is inflicted;(ii) to exclude compensation altogether in some cases;(iii) to abolish development charge;(iv) to retain the basis of payment for land compulsorily acquired at existing use value, with the addition of the full claim for loss of development value which has already been assessed under the Act of 1947.4. Following the discussions in the two Committees I still think that thisscheme is the best we can do, and that it would indeed both save money and be generally acceptable.The  300 million5. The Act fixed a sum of  300 million to be paid out, before 1st July next,to all owners of development value as it existed in 1947. It is generally agreedthat to pay out so vast a sum during the next twelve months would be undesirable for both political and financial reasons. Many of the claims need never be paid at all(where development will eventually be allowed, or where there is no intention of developing); many more need not be paid yet. This means that we must legislateto make compensation payable only when permission to develop is refused or theland is acquired by a public authority.But on what basis is compensation to be paid when the time comes? Ifcompensation were to be paid on the basis of the full development value of the land at the time when that value matures and is, therefore, at its peak, the State wouldbe faced with an enormous and unending liability. Planning continually shiftsvalues if you prevent building in one place the building value moves to another.To compensate every landlord at the peak of his value, would be an unending drain on public funds and would expose us to savage and justified attack. It wouldbecome impossible to prevent building over agricultural land, the continued sprawlof towns over the countryside, and the general waste of our natural resources. We42522
must, therefore, stick to the principle underlying the present system, that compe^&quot;^sation shall be limited to development values created in the past, and that theniPshall be no compensation for development values which accrue in the future. Thatis my reason for limiting the compensation payable on any piece of land to the1947 Act claim; but it would be the full amount of the claim as assessed, not the expected 80 per cent. (Assessment of claims is now virtually completed.) I am confident that landowners in general would accept this.&apos;&apos; 6. Of course, if we limit compensation in this way to the owner who is not allowed to develop his.land, while allowing the owner who is given permission toreap the full value (which will be the effect of the further proposal to abolishdevelopment charge), some owners will fare better than others. I am not perturbedat this prospect. It happens now, it always, has happened, and anyway we want to encourage development, provided that it is in the right place. Some of mycolleagues fear, I think, that the jealousy felt by those owners who are not allowedto develop, for their, more fortunate neighbours who are, would becomeunmanageable. I can only say that this has never been suggested in the talks which my officials have had with representatives of landowners.Development Charge7. The crucial question is what we are going to do. about development charge a concept for which, we must remember, the Conservative Party arepartly responsible (see the Coalition Government White Paper of 1944, Cmd. 6537).In principle there is a lot to be said for it as a means of securing betterment forthe State, and of holding the balance between those who are allowed to develop their land and those who are not: but in practice it does not work. The charge,in theory, is part of the price of the land; the owner should get only the existing use value, the charge is the balance due to development value. But in practice,the charge is regarded as a tax a penal tax on development. This feeling would remain even if land for development were generally available at existing use value.As it is, the landowner either takes his land off the market or continues to get thebest price that he can; and the charge, coming on top of the cost of the land, isin very many cases a real addition to the cost of development. This is particularlyserious where&apos; private house-building is concerned.8. It is sometimes suggested that the remedy lies in a reduction of the rateof development, charge. But to make much difference either to the land marketor to developers the reduction would have to be so substantial as to undermine the whole system. In any event, people hate charge; and they will continue to hateit whatever its level. In my view there is no satisfactory alternative to complete abolition of development charge. . .9. There would be considerable advantage in such a course, and it is widelyexpected that we will at least, abolish charge for private houses. But it is notpossible to abolish charge on housing and keep it for other forms of development.Housing accounts for 70 per cent, of all charge.10. If, however, we do abolish charge, and abandon the theory that develop-ment value in land is vested in the State, we shall be faced with the old cry about&quot; unearned increment &quot; and attacked for enabling private persons to make a profitout^of land values which may in part be due to the efforts of the community. Wehave to consider what our answer is going to be. Public improvements a newroad or railway perhaps may cause a steep rise in values, though in such caseswe might consider securing the profit for the community by enabling local andother public authorities to buy the land concerned. Our main defence would beto point to the fact that development charge is not an efficient instrument for thispurpose and that, like so many imposts, it is borne in the end by the final consumer- the man who wants to build himself a house. We can also point out thattaxation and death duties at present rates do reap much of the harvest for theExchequer. And, if we adopt the Limited Compensation Scheme we shah be ableto point to the fact that no landowner will receive in compensation more than the1.94.7, development value of his land, and that some, planning restrictions-e.g.,those imposed on.&quot; good-neighbour,&quot; grounds-will attract no compensation at all.&apos; 11. None the less the attack would be most damaging if the private ownerwere able to make public authorities pay for values that the community had helped to create. That is one reason why I think it most important that compulsory purchase should continue to be on the basis of its existing use value at the date of
bill the Balance of Advantage13. Weighing up the political advantages and disadvantages of the LimitedCompensation Scheme,ethe balance seems to me decisively in its favour. TheOpposition are unlikely to attack the decision not to pay out the  300 million;and if they decide to attack the decision to abolish development charge (which I am not at all sure that they will) we should have a pretty complete answer. Even thecry of &quot; unearned increment&quot; will not find us without an answer. A Bill on theselines would be presented not as overthrowing the whole structure of the 1947 Act,but as keeping the essential provisions while easing the difficulties which have beenfound in practice. In introducing it we would emphasise that we stand by thecentral feature of the Act the control of land use and that we are determined that effective use shall continue to be made of the powers which it contains to conserve the nation&apos;s land resources, and generally to improve the environmentinwhich people live.        .    . &apos;: &apos; .14. If my colleagues agree that we should amend on the lines of the LimitedCompensation Scheme I would propose that a White Paper be published setting outthe Governments intentions in general terms, and I would submit a draft to theCabinet as soon as possible. This.would fprm the basis of consultation with thelocal authority associations and other interested bodies on the many points of detailwhich have yet to be worked out.^*%e acquisition plus the claim for the 1947 development value. (The claim in these-cases would be paid by the acquiring authority.) This is not just politicalexpediency: it is essential in order to avoid an unjustifiable increase in the cost ofland for public development, e.g., housing, caused by the plan or by public improve-ments. By tying the price to be paid to existing use value plus the claim we avoidthese difficulties. Inevitably, of course, the owner whose land is compulsorily acquired will sometimes get a lower price, perhaps a much lower price, than if&apos;hesold privately, but this happens under the present system. Under my scheme, theman who is bought out will get as much as or more than he paid for. the land (unless he is a speculator or was badly advised); as much as or more than he has expectedto get since 1947. All he will lose will be the chance of making a profit. The powerof compulsory purchase could also be used to prevent necessary private develop-ment from being held up by land-owners holding out for extortionate prices.12. The abolition of charge would leave the Exchequer to meet the burdenof compensation without any off-setting contribution. There are various pointshere: (i) The cost to the Exchequer.   Charge is coming in at the rate of  7 to 8 million a year. Though this is expected to increase, it will bedecades before this comes anywhere near balancing an immediate pay-out of  300 million; and indeed it was never intended to. My scheme will cost a great deal less than  300 million, since nothing will be.paidto owners allowed to develop, or whose claims for compensation willbe excluded, and much of what does have to be paid will be deferred.I believe that, even in the long run, this scheme may cost less than.thepresent Act under which successive Governments will always be exposed to demands for abolition or reduction of charge. It will certainly costa great deal less in the next few years. ,It may be argued that the cheapest thing of all would be to deferpayment of claims as I propose, but still to keep charge or a proportionOf charge. But I maintain that charge in any degree is obnoxious.(ii) The notion that there ought to be a self-balancing scheme.  As I have explained the present Act is not self-balancing, and there is no reason why the owners of land which is developed should meet the compensa-tion for the owners of land which is not-even if they could be made to,which I do not think they could. The whole community benefits,e.g., from the preservation -of agricultural land.. - -(iii) The old li unearned increment &quot; argument which I have dealt with above.(iv) Planning is a local authority service, and my scheme entails payment bythe Treasury on decisions by local authorities. I propose to provide some check on this; but the real safeguard of the Treasury will be thelimitation of payments to the claims already settled. .,
Time-table (15. I would have liked to make an announcement and to lay a White paper before the summer recess. I am being pressed daily for a statement of the Govern-menfs intentions; and some people will not start building themselves housesuntil they know. But I do not think it is now possible to settle the White Paper,and have a debate on it, before Parliament rises.16. In any event, it will be necessary that the gap between announcement thatwe propose to abolish charge, and abolition, should be short. Once it is known that charge is to go, nobody will start building until they are clear of the liability to pay. Under the Act I can, with the consent of the Treasury, make regulationsexempting development of any kind from charge; and it may be that Ihe LawOfficers will hold that this power is wide enough to exempt all development by regulation. But it seems quite wrong virtually to suspend a whole Part of an Actby Regulation; and I think that we must wait till we can legislate.17. But we cannot wait longer than the autumn. The expectation of anearly announcement which will give at any rate some relief is now general. Theeffect is that some prospective developers are waiting for it; while it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Central Land Board to collect charge. I propose thatI should publish the White Paper as soon as Parliament reassembles in October(or possibly two or three weeks before, if that is thought appropriate), and should at the same time introduce a very short Bill two clauses at most-which willdefer the date for paying claims under Part VI and will suspend the operationof Part VII (development charges). It is in any event necessary to legislate for the deferment of payments before 1st July next, so that we have got to have a shortstand-still Bill whatever we do. Indeed, even if we kept the Act intact we shouldhave to have an autumn Bill to regulate the payments, and to defer the date of pay-out, since we could not now get it all done before 1st July.18. The debate on the White Paper and the Second Reading of the Bill couldbe taken together. I do not think that the whole business should take more than two days in the House of Commons. Committee and Report stages should be verybrief. I do not believe that there would be acute controversy on the stand-stillmeasure; it is even possible that there will be very little controversy on this although there would.no doubt be a long debate on the White Paper. many members of the Opposition will be glad to see development charge go.19. I would then propose that the main measure should be ready for intro-duction in the early Spring. That would allow time for discussion of the detailed scheme, after the broad principles had been approved.H. M.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W. 1,17th July, 1952.
