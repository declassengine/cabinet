Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No. 7 2C. (52) 2421st July, 1952CaBiNET OFFiChRECORD COPYCABINETCHARGES  FOR  OVERSEAS  TELEGRAMSMemorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralCommonwealth telecommunications are the joint concern of the Common-wealth Governments associated in the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board.The Post Office and Cable and Wireless, Limited, under the name of the UnitedKingdom National Body, are jointly responsible in this country for these services,and their revenues are pooled.2. The Treasury are the sole shareholders in Cable and Wireless, Limited,their investment being represented by the  31 \ million of 3 per cent. Savings Bondsissued in purchase of the shares of the old Company and a further sum of  2-million by way of prior holding in that Company. To provide a satisfactory return on this capital, it has been held that the Company should pay a dividend of 4 percent, on their authorised capital of  30 million.3. In 1950-51 the joint operating surplus of the United Kingdom NationalBody was  2-35 million, which allowed Cable and Wireless, Limited, to pay adividend of 4 per cent, to the Exchequer; the proportion of this surplus due to thePost Office for its operations in this country was  330,000. In 1951-52 the surplusfell to  1-57 million, which is not enough to enable the Treasury to meet theinterest on their Savings Bonds. In 1952-53 the position will be a great deal worse,as the surplus is not expected to exceed  0 - 75 million. (A fuller statement of the relevant figures is given in Annex A.) The main cause of this fall in the surplusis rising costs (especially salaries, wages and pensions), the effects of which werepostponed by an exceptional traffic increase consequent upon hostilities in Korea.4. Unless Cable and Wireless, Limited, pay a reasonable dividend theTreasury will, in effect, subsidise the overseas telegraph services. Moreover, underthe Commonwealth pooling scheme, a United Kingdom deficit would throw an unfair burden on the Commonwealth Governments.5. The increase in rates required is roughly one-third. I give at Annex Bsome typical examples of the &quot; ordinary &quot; rates (other rates, subject to what is said in paragraph 7 about the Commonwealth Press Rate, would be raised &quot;propor-tionately). Subject to the agreement of Colonial Governments, the Company would introduce similar increases in the Colonies. The total additional revenue accruing to the United Kingdom National Body in a full year (the first would be 1953-54)would be about  2 - 2 million. Even if costs do not rise further (which is improbable)this would only give us  100,000 or so above what is required.6. Current rates are extremely low by comparison with those charged inforeign countries and have in fact remained virtually unchanged for almost a quarterof a century.7. The position has been put to the Commonwealth Governments by theCommonwealth Telecommunications Board, who have agreed to our proposalsexcept for the Commonwealth Press Rate. It had been proposed to raise thepresent rate of Id. a word along with the rest, although we recognised that there42572
would be protests from the Commonwealth Press Union. This rate, reduced froi2\d. a word during the war and originally intended only for its duration, is much below the level of other press rates. The lack of Commonwealth agreement andthe strong opposition which may be expected from the Commonwealth Press leadsme to propose that no increase in this rate should be made at present. The revenue from ah increase to l%d. a word would be no more than  25,000 a year. ...8. The rate to North America is a special case. The bulk of the transatlantictraffic is carried by the American Cable Companies who operate in this countryand most of the increased payments in the United Kingdom will accordingly accrue to them. On the other hand, these American Companies have for some time been operating here at a loss and have for years been pressing for a rate increase; inequity an increase is clearly long overdue, seeing that whereas it costs Sd. a wordto send a telegram from here to North America, it costs Is. A\d. a word in the reverse direction. I propose an increase of the &quot; ordinary &quot; rate from Sd. to Is.This would mean additional revenue for the American Companies of about  380,000a year. New accounting arrangements now under discussion between us and the americans might reduce this by  65,000 a year. Until agreement is reached in ourcurrent discussions with the Americans, I think we must be prepared to postponethis increase. In that event, some mention of the matter would need to be madein any public announcement.9. The procedure for introducing the proposed increase in rates is by notice in the London Gazette. No Parliamentary procedure is involved, although ageneral announcement would need to be made in Parliament.10.   To summarise, I ask for approval to (a) an increase in the charges for overseas telegrams, except to the UnitedStates and Canada, and excluding the Commonwealth Press Rate, byroughly one-third;(b) an increase in the ordinary rate to the United States and Canada from8d. to Is. a word; this increase being postponed if necessary until agree-ment is reached in the current negotiations;(c) the making of an early statement in Parliament of our general intentions.11. This paper has been agreed with the Treasury (with reservations as regardsthe Commonwealth Press Rate), Colonial Office and Commonwealth relations office.D.   -Post Office Headquarters, EC. 1,15th July, 1952.
