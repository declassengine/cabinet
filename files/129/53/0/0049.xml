Z4T(THIsfjDGJJME-NT IS THE-PR-OP-ER-TY- OF -HER -britannic-4viA JEST Y-&apos;S-GGVERNMENT )secret. (52) 24922nd JULY, 1952.CABINET office record copy copy NO.CABINETINVESTMENT IN 1953.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.As my colleagues are aware I advocate further adjustment of theDefence programme in order to assist our balance of payments.   But it isclear that we cannot solve the balance of payments difficulties entirely at theexpense of the defence of the country.   I therefore ask my colleagues toconsider further the investment programme for 1953.   We must take decisions on this before the forthcoming debate.2. In spite of full discussions in the Cabinet and elsewhere it hasnot so far been possible to agree upon a programme of less than  Sjjs millions of new building work for 1953, broadly composed as follows:- foJ  millionsAll civil investment other than housing and manufacturingindustryManufacturing industryHousingDefenceDefence investment of civil departments32910041612018983These amounts represent a severe pruning of requirements in all casesexcept housing.3. To meet all these requirements would mean carrying out  110millions more new building work in 1953 than the programme fcr\this year,with a correspondingly increased drain on resources.   Whether or not thiswould be feasible, the attempt to achieve it wold draw resources away fromexports.   From this point of view we ought not to attempt more thajx  900millions of new building work in 1953.   All possible resources should be devoted to making secure our immediate balance of payments position.   Wemust have some guide as to what we can afford and as to how our resources areto be distributed, and therefore we must take decisions on the total size of thefuture programme and on the allocations to be made within it.The choices before us are:-(a) to decontrol building;(b) to accept the present objective of 260,000 houses in 1953 and cut other programmes drastically to bringthe total down to what we can afford;(c) to make percentage reductions all round.-1-
5, The first choice is to have no money limits to the building programme.   This would leave Departments free to authorise any building workthey chose.   The amount approved would clearly far eocceed what is feasible-,as the requirements given in paragraph 2 are already severely pruned.   If this happened we should soon be forced either to re-establish the investment programme, or to abandon altogether the control of building work, which would have become pointless and useless.   We should be driven into conditions in whichbuilding resources would go to the highest bidders, often for inessential purposes.New resources   of men and materials would be sucked into building by theseconditions at the expense of exports. Building costs and profits would rise andwage increases could not be resisted, with general inflationary consequences.I believe it is a delusion to suppose that such a situation could be controlled byallocations of steel and timber.   These operate on a quarterly or six monthlybasis.   To allow a building to start and then refuse the necessary materials forits completion would be a futile and absurd method of control.   Nor is it clearhow an allocation system could operate effectively without control of building work.   To counter such a situation by using monetary and credit restrictionto reduce the demand for building might well require measures which would cause increased unemployment in other fields, and which would most sharplyaffect building by manufacturing industry, which it is generally agreed ought tobe encouraged.   I cannot recommend this course,DRASTIC REDUCTION OF OTHER CIVIL INVESTMENT6. To restrict new building work to  900 millions and acceptthe housing and defence requirements in full would involve cutting the alreadypruned requirements for other civil investment by one-sixth to  346 millions.So large a cut could not be made to fall equally on all programmes.   It wouldmean allowing no new work whatever to start in 1953 in any programme,except for defence and housing.   This would have to apply even to the mose essential programmes such as coal, electricity, coke ovens, iron and steel,and manufacturing industry, and would have severe consequences in 1954, whenthe restriction of new starts in 1952 and 1953 would have its full effects, and cause a substantial decline in the level of investment.   I am convinced that thiscourse is impracticable.&apos; CONTRIBUTION ALL ROUND7. There remains the possibility of an all round contribution by themain component heads of the programme set put in paragraph 3,   This appearsto me the most practicable solution.   An all round reduction of 6fo on these heads5would give the following totals for the different items:-  millionsCivil investment other than housing and manufacturing industry 312Manufacturing industry 95Housing                                     - 395Defence 114Defence expenditure by civil departments 17933Although this produces a total of  33 millions more than I consider
!desirable, and although I should do so with great anxiety as to the consequences,I am willing to go so far to meet the views of my colleagues if they will agreeto the general reduction I propose.8. If this is agreed I propose that the reduction of civil investmentother than housing from  329 millions to  312 millions should be implementedby applying the lower proposals for new building and plant and machinery putforward in my memorandum to the Economic Policy Committee (E.A.(52) 75of 10th June, 1952) for all items other than manufacturing industry.9, If this compromise proposal is adopted it will involvesubstantial reductions in the requirements for programmes other thanhousing.   In my view it is essential that in these circumstances housingshould be brought within the starting date control exercised by the RegionalBuilding Committees, from which it alone is now exempt.   So long as housingremains exempt and is a rising programme it secures, in effect, local priority over all other building work of no matter what importance.PUBLIC STATEMENT10. I have made some progress with the Minister of Housing andthe Minister of Works as to the form of the statement to be made in the debatenext week, on the assumption that the compromise proposal set out inparagraphs 7 = 9 above is accepted.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.22nd July, 1952.
