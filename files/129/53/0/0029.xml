Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952CONFIDENTIALCABINET office record copy copy No. 7 6C. (52) 2298th July, 1952.CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATYDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF JAPANESE ASSETS INTHE UNITED KINGDOM CONFISCATED UNDER ARTICLE 14Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs with the coming into force of the Japanese Peace Treaty on 28th April,Japanese assets in the United Kingdom are (under Article 14) freely at the disposalof Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Their total net value is estimated at about 1,250,000, of which probably rather less than  900,000 will be available for distribution within six months.2. My colleagues will be aware that the last Government decided that the proceeds of these assets after liquidation should be distributed to selected benevolentorganisations closely linked with the Services or concerned with the interests of civilian internees. This was to be on the understanding that the money should beused primarily for the benefit of prisoners of war, civilian internees, and their dependants, who must be resident in the United Kingdom at the time of payments;that it was to meet need and hardship (on a broad interpretation of these terms)and was preferably not to be in the form of a continuing grant. The money wastherefore to be divided up between various organisations representing the three services and civilian internees in proportion to the number of each of the Servicesand the civilians who fell into enemy hands; of the total allocated to the three services 60 per cent, would be divided between the Royal Navy, the Army andthe Royal Air Force for use in proportion to the sum of prisoners of war from each service in all theatres of war. The remaining 40 per cent., after a suitable sum hadbeen allocated to the King&apos;s Fund administered by the Ministry of Pensions, would be divided between other welfare organisations whose work covered all three Services.3. This decision was announced by Mr. Herbert Morrison in reply to a writtenquestion on 25th July, 1951. It was endorsed by the President of the Board ofTrade when winding up the debate on the Japanese Peace Treaty on 26th Novem-ber, 1951, and by Mr. Nutting on 3rd March, in a written answer to a parliamentary question by Major Tufton Beamish.4. On reflection, however, I consider that the late Government^ decision was wrong for two reasons. First, it included as possible beneficiaries all ex-prisoners of war from whatever theatre; secondly, it provided for distribution bya number of benevolent societies to cover only certain selected cases in need orhardship.5. As for the first point, although the decision has been announced, and itwould therefore be inconvenient to reverse it, there is no logical reason for it.Only if assets from other former enemies were to be included in the total for distribution would it be a defensible proposition to distribute the proceeds to prisoners of war from all theatres.6. With regard to the second point, distribution by benevolent associationswill be necessarily lengthy and complicated, since none of the ex-Service organisa-tions covers the whole field.  The process of their distribution by so complicated42525
a means would also cost money and thereby reduce the total value of the assetsto be distributed. In any event the wisdom of the hardship test is questionable.The interests of prisoners now in difficulties are looked after by trie Ministryof Pensions or by benevolent organisations. Also some form of &quot; means test&quot; wouldhave to be applied, which there is every reason to believe would be very unpopular.7. In favour of changing the basis of distribution it may be considered thatthe prisoners of war of the Japanese have always pressed strongly for equal divisionof these assets on a per capita basis, however small each independent share might ultimately turn out to be. Each individual, moreover, who would receive on this basis about  20, could regard his share as damages recovered by him from Japanfor the Japanese breach of international law explicitly recognised by Articles 14and 16 of the Peace Treaty. It is also worthy of note that the United States and australia have indemnified ther ex-prisoners of war by a monetary distribution ona per capita basis. This has served to strengthen the stand taken by formerprisoners of war of the Japanese in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the views ofthe all-party Parliamentary Committee on Prisoners. of.War have been ascertained,and it has been found that all members were agreed that the funds should be applied only to former prisoners-of-war of the Japanese and that distribution should be ona per capita basis (the only disagreement being whether this distribution should bemade by the Far Eastern Prisoners-^of-War Association or by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment). Finally, it may be urged in favour of distribution on a per capita basis thatthe machinery to carry it out would be simple and that each man would feel thathe had received a fair share.8. There are two arguments which might be put forward against changing thelast Governments decision:  (a) Cases of hardship among former prisoners of-war and civilian interneeshave been led to expect more than an equal share of the proceeds of japanese assets and may be disappointed; and(b) It may well be argued that the sum which is freely at the disposal of her majesty&apos;s Government should be paid to the Exchequer for the benefitof all United Kingdom subjects.9. It is possible now that an announcement has been made that some disappointment -pointment will be caused. Cases of hardship, however, are the proper concern ofBenevolent Associations and any case of &quot; war injury &quot; is looked after by theMinistry of Pensions. With regard to the second argument, I submit that, since ithas already been decided to devote this sum of money to former prisoners of war.distribution on a per capita basis would seem the more logical method of carryingthis out.10. I therefore recommend that the decision of the last Government to devotethe proceeds of the Japanese assets in this country to cases of hardship amongformer prisoners of war and ex-civilian internees in general should be revoked, andthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government should distribute the proceeds of Japanese assets inthe United Kingdom on a per capita basis to all former prisoners of war or their dependants and to members of the Merchant Navy in Japanese hands during thewar and civilian internees or the dependents of both.11.   I invite my colleagues to approve this paper.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,8th July, 1952.
