j(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)iONFIDENTIAL,11C. (52) 220COPY NO,22nd JULY, 1952.CABINETGATWICK airport memorandum by the Minister of Civil AviationAircraft movements in the London area have increased by fiftyper cent in the past four years.   Passengers handled have doubled in the sameperiod and will double again by I960.   In 1951 London Airport and Northolttogether handled over one a id a half million passengers (over 300,000 more thandid our businest seaport, Dover).   All this raises major Air Traffic Controlproblems.   In this crowded air space it is becoming increasingly difficult touse both London Airport and Northolt.   By 1955/6 it will only be possible to manage if civil flying at Northolt ceases,   Northolt will therefore be returned tothe Royal Air Force in 1959/6 and will be held in reserve against a war.Peacetime flying by the Royal Air Force at Northolt will be carried on in sucha way that it will not interfere with the London Airport traffic pattern.2. With Northolt so treated, London Airport if developed as planned,should be able to deal with the traffic we expect, except for certain short-haul European services.   But when bad visibility slows down movements(as it often will), diversions will be necessary.   There are at present sevenaerodromes available for civil flying in the London area.   I propose to reducethem to three:  London Airport, Blackbushe and Gatwick.3. Gatwick, however, needs complete reconstruction if it is toaccept large aircraft diverted from London Airport, which it must be able to do.This will mean spending about  2 millions there by the end of 1955 and about \i millions during the following five years.   How this would be phased is setout in Appendix B.   Of this ex&quot;penditure about  / - million will pay for itselfthrough hangar rents.   Against the rest can be set the savings to the government from giving up the other airports - about  753,003 capital and  (f33, &quot;&apos;00 per annumon operating costs.   There will also be earnings from landing fees, office rents,concessions, etc.4, The Home Affairs Committee have approved this project.   I now seek the agreement of the Cabinet to the development of Gatwick at a costof about  6 millions in the next seven years.A.T.L-B.Ministry of Civil Aviation, W.C.1.22nd JULY, 1952.

LONDON AIRPORT CAPACITYf^j The estimated peak hour movements of air transport services in the London area, during the next eight years are as follows:-Movements ina peak hour1952	351953	381954	411955	451956	501957	551953	591959	641960	70Against this, the estimated capacity of London Airport withdual parallel runways in use, and with Northolt Airport closed to all civilflying is 60 movements an hour in fine weather, and 21 per hour in bad weatherrising to 42 per hour in 1960 if expected improvements in landing aids andtechnique are achieved.
