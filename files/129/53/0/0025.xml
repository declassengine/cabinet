(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret(52) 225 COPY NO. 6 2V4TH JULY, 1952CABINETTHE DEFENCE PRODUCTION PROGRAMMENote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate a copy of a minute from the Minister of Defence.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S. W. 1. ,4TH JULY, 1952.PRIME MINISTER FROM MINISTER OF DEFENCE:   MINUTE OF 2ND JULY, 1952At this morning&apos;s meeting of the Defence Committee, the service ministers and the Minister of Supply drew attention to the need for an early statement of Government policy on defence production.   They pointed out thatit was already becoming known, particularly to the aircraft industry, that considerable readjustments of programme work were contemplated.   Indeed,discussions had had to be started with the firms making Canberras to indicate to them that they were unlikely to get follow-up orders.   It will soon become known, too, that considerable sales of equipment are being negotiated.2. Great efforts have been made over the last 18 months to accelerate production programmes, to bring in new capacity, and, generally, to stimulate industry to the maximum efforts in rearmament.   The effect of cuttingback orders, of changing capacity over to production for export, and of other similar measures, will be very bad indeed unless a clear statement is madeof Government intentions and policy.   All the steam will go out of the effortif industry is left to draw what will probably be quite wrong conclusions fromadministrative acts and actions consequent upon a policy which has not been explained to them. i3. May I suggest that the situation should be discussed at Cabinetearly next week.   In the meanwhile thought can be given to the scope of any government statement, and the method to be followed in making it..
