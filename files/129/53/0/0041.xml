SECRET r \ p j m   y  n cci ^.C. (52) 241 RECORD COPY COPY NO. )  h15TH JULY, 1952CABINETHOUSING - 1953Memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local GovernmentOn 28th December, 1951, the Cabinet instructed me (C. C. (51) 20thConclusions, Minute 3(2)) to prepare a building plan which would result in thecompletion of houses at the following rates 1952  -  230,000, 1953 - 260,000,1954 - 300,000.   I was also authorised to improve upon these figures if it were possible having regard to the resources available.2. By that decision we moved for the first time since 1947 from a fixedto an expanding programme.   For a fixed programme all that was necessary wasto allocate the right number of houses to each Local Authority and to see thatthey were built.   When performance did not accord with planning, an excess was as much a sin as a deficiency.3. My mandate was to expand and to expand as rapidly as physicalresources allowed.   For six months I have been planning to build and trying to start in each locality as many houses as could be built with available resources.I have been urging Local Authorities and builders to act accordingly.4. We have now in our programme -243,000 houses under construction82,000 houses in contracts but not yet started161,000 in unused instalments to Local Authorities486,0005. Of these 120,000 should be finished this year.   Even if I offered nofurther instalments during the next six months - and such action would be clear evidence of a restriction in the programme - there would still be at the beginningof next year some 366,000 houses in our announced programme.6. The expansion of our programme in 1953 can be prevented only by oneof two things -(1) By stopping or slowing down further acceptance of tenders and furtherlicences.(2)  By failing to provide the actual materials.The first would have to be announced, with all its political andindustrial consequences.
What I wish to emphasise now is that the suggested action for1953 means an immediate reversal of our policy and an immediate announcement,9, I can at this stage do little to alter the cost or design of houses to be completed in 1953,   Most of them are already under construction or in contracts let.My colleagues are aware that on taking office we rapidly developed the idea of the smaller house, already explored by Dr. Dalton,   This led tothe publication of &quot;Houses 1952&quot;,   The People&apos;s House was launched.Within a few months of the publicity which we have worked up wehave achieved remarkable results.   I am told that the People&apos;s House will cover at least two-thirds of the 1953 programme.   I will press forward with it.10, The adoption of the People&apos;s House saves about 10% of structural materials.   It does not save any great amount of timber.We are now working on house designs to reduce the use of timber.   But we must take time for our experiments to be fruitful and to have the results accepted.Success will, of course depend on the substitutes (largely cement and high tensile wire) being available.   But in any case designs of timber savinghouses cannot be fed into the programme this year.   If our experiments are successful they can affect only a proportion of the 1953 starts and the1954 completions.   I am working on the details of this problem.11. Although for convenience and for the purpose of politicalpropaganda, a calendar year is a useful measure it has but a slender relationto a production programme.   This must be a continuous and a steady process.The building industry has bitter memories.   The mistakes ofbooms and slumps at short notice have been made before.   They must notbe made again.In 1950 a Working Party on building made this report -&quot;Unfortunately the building industry, more perhaps than any other, has in thepast suffered on account of recurrent failure to implement announcedprogrammes.   If building is to be looked on as a tap which can be turned on andoff for economic reasons, then efficiency cannot be expected. &quot;This is a profoundly true observation.It would bring us moral discredit and seems to me quiteunacceptable.7, I am clear that the Government cannot refrain from at leastaiming at the increased target for 1953 without definitely announcing achange in their policy,8, 1954 is another matter.   If the Government were to come to theconclusion that they must take longer than 1954 to attain their objective of 300,000 houses then the rate at which new instalments are issued could beslowed down from the date at which the decision was taken.
For this sound reason of maintaining confidence and for theson that without announcing a reversal of Government policy we can make no practical difference in the execution of the programme for 1953, I ask my colleagues not at this stage to make any change in the programme Ihave planned and put in hand for 1953.   I shall, of course, do all I can tocarry it out as economically as I can both in finance and in materials.13. I do not seek now a decision on 1954.   There is still time for a fuller examination of our programme for that year.H. MiMinistry of Housing and LocalGovernment, S. W. 1. ,15TH JULY, 1952.
