They do this on the strength of vague impressions that pressure on sterling mayrevive in the Autumn.   They say they cannot give any exact reasons for this,though to the outsider the reason seems clear, namely leakages to cityfinancial journals which have been openly canvassing the Bank&apos;s proposals.In March when prospects were bad the Cabinet decided against theBank&apos;s plan.   Nothing seems to have occurred since to justify altering thisdecision.BALANCE IN SECOND HALF OF 1952It is reckoned that in the second half of this year the payments ofthe sterling area will exceed the receipts by  175 millions.   It is hoped to redress this balance by expanding exports (coal, defence items, etc.) by 24 millions and cutting imports (oil, machinery, raw materials and food)by  150 millions.  Any short-fall in achieving a concrete physical balance ofour trade in some such way will inevitably fall upon our gold and dollar reserves.As these have now fallen to about $1,650 millions action on these lines istherefore clearly necessary.   Everybody agrees that unless this fundamentalcondition is fulfilled nothing can save us.   Nobody suggests that the Bank&apos;splan will help to cure this deficit.There is the secondary risk that the outside world may loseconfidence in the future of the pound and sell sterling at its present price of$2. 8 in the hope of buying it back at a lower price.   As we owe about- 2,500 millions to the Sterling Area and  1,000 millions to non-sterling areaholders this is a real danger.
THE BANK&apos;S PLAN. STERLING BALANCES1. To persuade the sterling area holders to agree not to draw down their balances rapidly and to publish this agreement.This seems a very good proposal if it can be arranged,2. To block 90% df the balances held outside the sterling areawhether the holders like it or not.This seems a very odd way of restoring confidence in sterling.Who is going to put his money in the United Kingdom after such action?   what will in fact happen will be that immediately the proposal leaks out, as it willas soon as the Commonwealth and Europe are consulted, there will be a run on sterling held by foreigners, and a drain on reserves by lead-lag methods, etc.,such as occurred in 1947 when we lost  300 millions in a matter of weeks.To tide us over it is proposed to borrow from the International Monetary FundiThis recalls 1931 when We also borrowed  50 millions to see us through the run on sterling - and lost it all.FLOATING RATE3. To let the rate of exchange &quot;float&quot;, i. e. find its own level.To the banker this seems the obvious way of meeting our primaryneed, i. e&apos;. balancing our trade.   If imports exceed exports, he argues, exportswill be encouraged While import prices Will rise.   Hence imports will bechoked off, which is what he wants no matter how high food prices rise or how much unemployment is caused.   It is the policy which the Socialists have always imputed.to Conservatives and which we have always vehemently denied.It is the plain English for the attractive sounding but otherwise meaninglessphrase &quot;Take the strain off the reserves and put it on to the rate of exchange&quot;.But anyhow if would not work that way to-day.   For our exports arenot limited by price.   Metal goods are limited by lack of steel;  soft goodsby the world slump in demand for textile s^As to imports we are already largely committed for the second halfof 1952.   Moreover they are cut to the bone.   We shall have to reduce them ofcourse.   But surely it is better to cut selectively than to face an all-roundrise in prices, which would have to be great if it were to have any effect.But even if everything did work according to plan the fall in the rateof exchange would inevitably widen the gap and increase the drain on the reserves.   If the pound is allowed &quot;to float&quot; before sterling is strong, this is bound to happen.   That is the over-riding objection to letting the pound slidewhile our position is weak.If, as is hoped* some other countries let their currencies float withours it will to that extent weaken this objection.   But this is a gamble.   Andanyhow the rise in the dollar gap - our principal problem - would remain.It can be argued that when the pound has fallen low enoughspeculators will buy in the hope of appreciation.   But will they, when 90% of previous holdings have been confiscated?  And who can tell what they willIt is to cope with this risk, i.e. to create confidence, that tieBank proposes:
consider &quot;low enough&quot; in view of the risk.   For some time at any rate they are much more likely to sell expecting (and causing) a further drop.  And theyjlg^ will almost certainly be right;  and the gap will widen.Finally, it is said that this is the only way to force Ministers&apos; hands.Nothing, it is claimed, will make them agree to the necessary import cuts save the force majeure of a rise in prices so great as to make further purchasesimpossible.   If this is so it is a terrible reflection on Ministers.  Against thispretended advantage we have to set the certain disadvantage that any rise inprices will lead to a demand for increased wages.  And this will be muchharder to parry if the rise cannot be blamed on world causes but is attri-buted, not without reason, to a Conservative surrender to &quot;the bankers1 ramp&quot;.CONVERTIBILITY4. It is proposed that apart from the blocked balances foreign residentsshould be allowed to convert any sterling they hold or earn into gold or dollarsat the prevailing rate.This would certainly be a convenience to bankers, though such an argument would scarcely carry much weight with the public and the TradesUnion Congress.   Moreover it would stop transactions in cheap sterling whichthe Bank seems to think can be prevented in no other way.   But these are notvery important anyhow;  indeed they are not mentioned in the Chancellor&apos;s paper.We are told the Commonwealth would welcome it.   But would they,if the rate dropped and the value of their sterling balances fell?   It wouldseem far more likely not to inspire confidence but to cause anyone who could do so to convert to gold as fast as possible.Then we are told Convertibility is a step towards &quot;one world&quot;i. e. multilateral trade.   But we are just anxiously considering the extremelycomplex question as to whether we want to aim at multilateral trade.   If we do,which is by no means certain, we are much more likely to achieve it by a stepby step approach than by a leap in the dark, which may lead to a completedebacle and force us back to bilateralism in an extreme form.Against all these dubious advantages stands the incontrovertiblefact that Convertibility will be a tremendous incentive to people outside theUnited Kingdom to send us imports and refuse our exports.   For every poundthus earned can and will be converted to gold.   This terrible handicap to our exports is probably the strongest long term economic argument against theBank&apos;s plan.But, of course, there may be a ahort-term collapse before that, ifthe foreign holders get wind of the proposals and cash in before their balancesare blocked, while lead-dag operations rise inordinately.Thus on the economic side the Floating Rate and Convertibility,apart from other objections, would make it harder to export enough to pay for our imports and thus increase the drain on our reserves and weakenconfidence in sterling.POLITICAL OBJECTIONSOn the political side the BaruVs Plan would be equally disastrous.At home, as has been said, it operates and is intended to operate,by cutting rations and causing unemployment.   Far better to be forced into this,if we must, than to create these disasters by deliberate Government action;rJ -5 ^
action moreover, which will almost certainly be publicly castigated byleading economists of the Right as well as of the Left.Abroad the plan will break up the Organisation for european economic Co-operation and smash the European Payments Union just after we have drawn over  200 millions from it.   Could anything create more ill-feeling in Europe or for that matter in the United States?   The americans will hate the free market in gold the plan requires.   If on top of that their most trusted ally deliberately sabotages their efforts to build upco-operation in Europe it will strengthen isolationism all over the Union.As for the Commonwealth, whose Prime Ministers have only just been invited to London in November to concert a common commercial andfinancial policy, what will they think if we adopt proposals which prejudgeall the vital issues?  Surely these matters are just the sort of things theywere invited to consider.ALTERNATIVESThe Chancellor invites us to put forward alternative suggestions.Oh the short-term these are surely being considered by the Cabinet under the headings:  Investment Policy, Import Programme, Defence and the Balanceof Payments, and so on.The long-term policy is being considered by the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sCommittee on External Commercial Policy.   It is an immensely complicatedproblem;  it is hoped to hammer out a solution in time for the commonwealth prime Ministers&apos; Conference in November.In the meantime, if we take the necessary measures to redress our trade balance by selling more abroad and buying less, which will have to bedone whether the Bank&apos;s plan is adopted or not, we shall probably get through the autumn without disaster.   If there is difficulty in surmounting thehump we can borrow just as the Bank propose to do if their plan is followed.But there is no mystical significance in SI,340 millions, &quot;the figure at whichCripps devalued&quot;.       During the war our reserves fell to 212 millions.   Itwould perhaps strengthen confidence if this were stated.   It would also helpif agreement between holders of sterling balances to refrain from drawing onthese beyond a certain limit could be publicised.TIME SCALEHow long it would be before disaster overtook us if the Bank&apos;splan were adopted is difficult to predict.   It might be only a matter of weeks ifleakage that balances might be blocked, and the pound thrown overboard tofloat where it could, provoked a run on sterling.   If we succeeded in turningthat corner, the widening gap due to a fall in the value of the pound and todiscrimination against our exports, induced by the right to convert a sterlingsurplus to gold, would increase the drain on the reserves leading to collapseprobably in six or eight months.conclusion the question is whether, by our deliberate action and by ourconsidered choice, we should ask the country to incur such dangers and bringupon ourselves such odium unless very much stronger evidence is brought forward to prove that the other course would certainly lead to worse disasters.The Bank has been wrong before.   It may be now.Paymaster-Generals Office, S.W.1. ,30TH JUNE, 1952.
