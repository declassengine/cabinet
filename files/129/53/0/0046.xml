SECRET , !    ^cabinet OFFICRecord copy copy no.C.(52) 24618th july, 1952.CABINETTHE IRON AND STEEL, industry memorandum by the Minister of supply as requested, I submit a draft of the White Paper on iron andsteel, revised in the light of the Cabinefs discussions.2. So as to give greater prominence to our proposals for thepublic supervision of the industry as distinct from those concerned with thetransfer of ownership, the order in which these two sections are presented hasbeen reversed.3. If it should be decided to make some reference to theGovernments desire for an agreed settlement of this problem, I suggest that,when the White Paper is issued, a statement on the following lines should bemade:&quot; The Government believe that the proposals set out inthe White Paper offer a reasonable and workable solution to the problems of supervision and ownership in the ironand steel industry.   At the same time, they recognise the importance of lifting the iron and steel industry outof the arena of party controversy.   They are therefore prepared, between now and the introduction of the Bill,to consider sympathetically any constructive amendments which would provide a basis for an agreed settlement. &quot;D.S,Ministry of Supply, W.C.2;18th july, 1952.
IRON AND STEELINDUSTRYPresented by the Minister of Supply to parliament by Command of Her Majesty1952LONDONHER   MAJESTVS   STATIONERY   OFFICEnetDRAFT
IRON AND STEEL industry i. introductory. In the King&apos;s Speech at the opening of the present Parliament, it was announced that legislation would be introduced to provide for the reorganisa-tion of the iron and steel industry under free enterprise with an adequatemeasure of public supervision. A Bill to give effect to this policy will be presented to the House of Commons early in the next Session. meanwhile the Government consider it desirable to make a statement of their proposals.2. In framing their proposals the Government have had regard to earlierarrangements for the supervision of the industry, first by the Import duties advisory Committee from 1932 to 1939, then by the Iron and Steel Controlduring the war and later by the Iron and Steel Board set up in 1946.3. The Government have discussed their proposals in outline with the Ironand Steel Corporation of Great Britain, the Iron and Steel Consumers&apos; Coun-cil, the British Iron and Steel Federation, the Trades Union Congress, theJoint Iron Council and the National Council of Associated Iron Ore produce-cers. These organizations were not asked to express final opinions and theTrades Union Congress, for their part, stated that they wished to reserve their position. The Government have also had discussions with a numberof trade associations on matters affecting their particular sectors of theindustry.4. The Governments proposals, which are set out in the succeedingparagraphs, fall into two parts relating respectively to the problem ofpublic supervision and that of the transfer of ownership.II.   PUBLIC SUPERVISIONIron and Steel board. In order to provide public supervision of the iron and steel industry,it is proposed to set up an Iron and Steel Board with statutory duties and powers.6. The Board, which will be appointed by the Minister of Supply, will be composed of not more than 12 members. Qualifications for membershipwill include experience in the iron and steel industry, in the engineering andother industries using iron and steel, and in trade unions. There will bean independent chairman and some additional independent members.7. Members of the Board will be appointed for a maximum term of 5 years and will be eligible for re-appointment.Scope of the Board8. It is intended that all the main processes which make up the ironand steel industry, set out in the Appendix, shall come within the purview of the new Board, thus bringing the whole industry again under the super-vision of a single authority and ending the present distinction betweennationalised and non-nationalised sectors. The Board will not be concernedwith the extensive engineering and other extraneous activities which, though not part of the iron and steel industry, were brought under the control ofthe Iron and Steel Corporation because they happened to form part of theactivities of the companies which were nationalised.
Di/gjk and Powers of the Board97&quot;fhe Board will have the general duty of supervising the industry with a view to promoting the efficient, economical and adequate supply of iron and steel, and will be required in particular to keep under review :(a) development of production capacity ;(6) prices ;(c) raw material supplies ;(d) research and technical training ; &apos;(e) arrangements for joint consultation between management and em-ployees on matters of mutual interest other than wages and condi-tions of service ; and(/) arrangements for the safety, health and welfare of employees.10. Whilst the powers of the Board are intended to provide for the super-vision of the whole iron and steel industry, they will not extend beyond it,for example to the activities of steel-using industries or metal merchants.11. So long as the present emergency powers or similar powers under other legislation continue to be exercised, the Government will consult theBoard in regard to their application to the iron and steel industry, and inappropriate cases may authorise the Board to exercise them on behalf ofthe Government.Development12. One of the most important responsibilities of the Board will be to supervise capital development. It will be the Board&apos;s duty to discuss with theiron and steel companies their plans, in order that they may be satisfied that individual schemes are consistent with the proper development of the industry as a whole and that any additional capacity or improved facilities requiredwill be provided.13. If a company should put forward a major scheme which in the opinionof the Board would seriously prejudice the efficient and economical develop-ment of the industry, the Board will have power to restrain that company from embarking upon such a scheme. Companies dissatisfied with theBoard&apos;s decision will have the right of appeal to the Minister of Supply.14. On grounds of general national interest it may at times be desirableto carry out schemes of capital development which on commercial groundsno company feels able to undertake. It is therefore proposed to give powersto the Minister of Supply to arrange in such cases, after consultation withthe Board, for the provision and operation of the additional works or other facilities required.15. The Government propose to give these positive powers to the Ministerand not to the Board because, if the Board are to preserve impartialityin the performance of their duty of supervising the industry as a whole, theymust remain free from responsibilities of ownership or management in respect of particular concerns.Prices16. In view of the importance of iron and steel to the national economy, itis proposed to give to the Board power to fix maximum prices for sales inthe United Kingdom. Discretion will be left to the Board to decide fromtime to time in respect of which products such price control is necessary.  Tn16149
addition it is propose^ that the Government should have in reserve a/Overto intervene in the fixing of maximum iron and steel prices should the\JSjlicinterest so require.17. In order to avoid overlapping, the Board&apos;s price-fixing powers willnot be exercisable in respect of any product for which a Price Control order under Defence Regulations is at the time operative. On the other hand,the Minister of Supply will be required to consult the Board before making any such order in respect of any product or raw material of the industry,including scrap.Enforcement of Board&apos;s decisions18. The Bill will provide that all producers of iron and steel shall bedeemed to have entered into a contractual obligation with the Board to observe their decisions in relation to development and prices. The Board&apos;decisions will thus be enforceable by civil proceedings for an injunction.Supply of Raw Materials19. The Board will keep under review the distribution of raw materials,including scrap. In times of shortage, such as the present, when emergency powers are in operation, it is the Governments intention that the board should control the distribution of scarce raw materials within the iron andsteel industry under the authority of the Minister of Supply.20. In view of the dependence of the United Kingdom upon supplies of high grade iron ore and other raw materials from abroad, the Board willhave to assure themselves that the arrangements made by the industry forimportation of the- raw materials it requires and their distribution are satis-factory. The Board will be empowered themselves to take steps to securethe imports required, should they consider the industry&apos;s arrangementsinadequate.21. The Board may also if necessary arrange for the import of iron or steel, in finished or semi-finished form.22. In order to avoid serious price discrepancies due to the higher costof imported iron and steel and raw materials, the Board may arrange, withthe approval of the Minister of Supply, for these to be sold below cost andfor the loss to be recovered from appropriate sectors of industry, as is done at present.Research and Training23. The Board will be empowered to take steps to promote research andthe training and education of employees, should they consider that the indus-try&apos;s arrangements are inadequate, and to make any necessary grants or loans.Expenses of the Board24. The Board will have power to obtain payments from the iron andsteel companies to meet their expenses, including, when necessary, the lossesinvolved in selling imported materials below cost. These payments willbe fixed in accordance with principles to be approved by the Minister, whobefore giving his consent will consider any representations by the companies concerned.Statistics25. The Board will arrange for the periodical publication of statisticsrelating to the industry, and the iron and steel companies will be requiredto furnish any necessary information.
AppPTMon to Northern Ireland28g irb.e powers relating to prices will apply to sales of iron and steel in Northern Ireland as well as in Great Britain. The other functions ofthe Board may be applied to Northern Ireland upon the request of theNorthern Ireland Parliament.Import Duties27. It is the Governments intention to consult the Board in regard toany proposed modifications to the import duties on iron and steel.Report to Parliament28. The Board will make an annual report to the Minister of Supply, whowill lay it before Parliament.III.   TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIPHolding and Realisation Agency29. The Bill will provide for the dissolution of the Iron and Steel Cor-poration of Great Britain, and for the transfer of the securities of the nationalised companies to a Holding and Realisation Agency.30. The Agency, which will be composed of a small number of personspossessing the necessary qualifications and experience, will be appointedby the Treasury.31. The Agency will have the duty to secure the return of these companies to private ownership and meanwhile to ensure their efficient direction, as explained in the ensuing paragraphs.Disposal of Companies32. In disposing of the securities transferred to them from the Corporation,the Agency will be required to obtain the approval of the Treasury in regardto the terms of sales. Subject to similar approval, the Agency will have discretion as to the timing. Sales will start as soon as possible after thepassing of the Bill. However in view of the magnitude of the financialoperations involved, these may well take some years to complete.33. Before disposal, the Agency may effect such re-groupings of the under-takings or alterations in the capital structure of companies as may bedesirable. The Agency will be required to consult the new Iron and steel board in regard to re-groupings.34. In deciding the price to be asked, regard will be had to all relevant factors at the time of sale. Account will have to be taken of the importantchanges which have taken place since nationalisation in the physical assets,capital structure, reserves and trading prospects of many of the iron and steel companies, together with other considerations such as the monetary and market conditions prevailing at the time.35. In allocating securities offered for sale, the Agency will, notwithstand-ing the serious technical difficulties involved, give priority where practicable to applications from former shareholders.
Transitional Arrangements ./&quot;\36. During the period of transition, the Agency will be empowere*sjwiththe approval of the Treasury to provide finance for companies whosesecurities they hold.37. The Agency will exercise their powers as shareholders in the normal way, but will not intervene in matters of day to day management. It isintended that, pending disposal, companies owned by the Agency should operate as far as possible on the same footing as their privately ownedcompetitors, and should stand in the same relationship as the latter to theIron and Steel Board.Finance38. The Agency will pay to the Treasury the monies they receive fromsales and dividends. The Treasury will provide such sums as are necessaryto meet the Agency&apos;s outgoings.39. Iron and Steel Stock will become part of the National Debt and willbe re-named 3-J- per cent. Treasury Stock, 1979-81.40. The Agency will be empowered to accept this Stock and most other government Stock in payment for securities of iron and steel companiessold by them. Since the sale price wiil be fixed in relation to conditionscurrent at the time of sale, these Government Stocks will be accepted at theirthen current market value.Report to Parliament41. The Agency will make an annual report to the Treasury who will layit before Parliament.APPENDIXiron and steel processes to be supervisedby the board1.
