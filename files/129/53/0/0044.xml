Printed for the Cabinet.   Julv 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No.   6 9C. (52) 24416th July, 1952CABINET office record COPYCABINETAWARD   OF   SCHOLARSHIPS   AT   BRITISH   UNIVERSITIES   TOCOMMEMORATE THE MARSHALL PLANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHer Majesty&apos;s Government have now received the last of the United States aidgranted under the Marshall Plan, or European Recovery Programme,launched in General George C. Marshall&apos;s now famous speech atHarvard in June 1947. It is fitting that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should com-memorate in some enduring fashion this generous and far-seeing programme,sponsored by the American Government and people, by which the British people have so greatly benefited.2. Under the previous Government a project was devised for commemoratingthe Marshall Plan by founding a number of Scholarships for American students at british Universities, to be known as &quot; Marshall Scholarships.&quot; This project was approved in principle by Mr. Attlee, Mr. Morrison and Mr. Gaitskell, but not finally adopted before the former Government fell. After considering a number ofother suggestions, I have since revived it and now present it in outline to mycolleagues in the Annex to this memorandum,3. In preparing the project I have had the benefit of the advice of Sir HectorHetherington, Chairman of the Vice-Chancellors&apos; Committee, Dr. Frank Aydelotte,the American Secretary to the Rhodes Trustees, and Sir Oliver Franks, her majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington. The United States Secretary of State andGeneral Marshall have been sounded informally about the proposal. Both were infavour of it and General Marshall has agreed to the use of his name.4. Legislation would be required to give effect to the proposal and it is unlikely that any awards could be made before the 1953-54 academic year. Never-theless, it is desirable to announce the scheme soon, before there is a change ofAdministration in the United States and before the Marshall Plan begins to fadefrom the public mind in both countries.5. One aspect of this proposal which might give rise to controversy concerns the value of the Scholarships. Rhodes Scholars receive  500 a year and the trustees are not at present in a position to increase the amount, even though it isgenerally considered by University authorities to be inadequate for foreign scholars.Dr. Aydelotte has admitted that Rhodes Scholars are expected to supplement theirScholarships from their private resources and sees no objection to this practice. he considers that it would make an unfortunate impression among ex-RhodesScholars in the United States if Marshall Scholars were offered more valuableScholarships. On the other hand, there are a number of points whichwould differentiate Marshall Scholarships from Rhodes Scholarships; theywould be open to women and to married students, and the age limitswould be different. And they will be sponsored by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment who should not be committed to an inadequate proposition. I have therefore recommended a basic stipend of  600 a year, with an additional  200 ayear for a married man. This would mean that, in addition to the estimated costof administration in the United States of $10,000-$ 15,000 a year, the sterling cost42574
of the Scholarships would be initially about  8,000, rising to  16,000 in the second year and to  20,000 in the third year. (The sterling cost should remain constantat this figure, if it can be assumed that about half the Scholars would remain for a third year. It is also assumed that about one-third of the Scholars would bemarried and would so qualify for an extra  200 a year.)6. If my colleagues approve this proposal in principle, I consider that anannouncement should be made in Parliament before the recess; but I propose thatthis announcement should be in very general terms. It could be limited to the first paragraph of the annex. The details of the scheme should be further considered in connexion with the proposed legislation.recommendations.   I recommend that my colleagues should (a) approve the project outlined in the annex; and&apos;(b) authorise me to announce it at an early date.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,16th July, 1952.ANNEXMARSHALL  SCHOLARSHIPSPurpose and Scope of the ProjectIt is intended to introduce legislation and to appropriate funds annually whichwill enable twelve Scholarships to be granted each year at British Universitiesto United States students. These Scholarships will be designated &quot; MarshallScholarships.&quot; Scholarships will be tenable for two to three years at any BritishUniversity and are open to all United States students up to the age of 30,including women and married men, who have graduated at a United StatesUniversity and are nominated by the Selection Committees in the United States(see below).Value of the ScholarshipsScholars will receive  600 a year, together with an agreed sum for trans-Atlantic passage.on taking up the Scholarship and on return to the United Statesafter completion of-studies. Married men will receive an additional  200 a year.Method of SelectionDistrict Committees will be set up in the United States covering the four mainareas: the Pacific Coast, the mid-West, the South and the East Coast. each district Committee will have four to five members, including the British consular officers residing in the principal city of the area where the Committee willcustomarily meet twice yearly. Secretarial and administrative services will beprovided by the British Consular Officer and his staff. Prominent Americancitizens, either men or women, especially those with academic qualifications,normally residing in the area, will be invited to serve on the Committees; travelling expenses will be paid, together with an honarium of $100 for each meeting. Thefirst annual meeting of the District Committee will be held in order to study the postal applications received; the second meeting will be devoted to interviewingselected candidates. One half of the travelling expenses of candidates selected for interview will be paid. Each District Committee will select three candidateseach year and will forward their names,. preference for University, subject ofstudy, &amp;c, to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, who will be responsiblefor co-ordinating the work of the District Committees. For this purposeHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador will be aided by a small Advisory Committee in washington, which would include eminent American citizens.
&quot;Cost of Administration in the United States: On the assumption that secretarial and clerical assistance will be providedby Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy and the four British Consular Posts concerned, and thatthe bulk of the literature publicising the scheme can be printed in the UnitedKingdom, it is estimated that the dollar cost should not exceed $10,000-$ 15,000a year. ..Organisation in the United KingdomAn Executive Secretary will be required, who will be advised by a smallsub-Committee, under the auspices of the Vice-Chancellors&apos; Committee, to ensurethe placing of Marshall Scholars at British Universities. He wilt handle, where necessary in consultation with Her Majesty&apos;s Government, any financial and other problems which would not fall within the competence of the University and Collegeauthorities.
