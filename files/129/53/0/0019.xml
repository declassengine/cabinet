IRON AND STEEL industry i. introductory ^1. In the King&apos;s Speech at the opening of the present Parliament, it ^^Ow.announced that legislation would be introduced &quot; to annul the Iron andSteel Act with a view to the re-organisation of the industry under free enter-prise, but with an adequate measure of public supervision &quot;. A Bill to giveeffect to this policy will be presented to the House of Commons as soonas the parliamentary timetable permits. However, since it appears unlikelythat this legislation can be passed during the present session, the Govern-ment consider it desirable to make a statement of their proposals so asto remove uncertainty in this regard.2. In framing their proposals the Government have had regard to earlierarrangements for the supervision of the industry, first by the Import duties advisory Committee from 1932 to 1939, then by the Iron and Steel Controlduring the war and later by the Iron and Steel Board set up in 1946.3. The Government have consulted the Iron and Steel Corporation ofGreat Britain, the Iron and Steel Consumers&apos; Council, the British Iron andSteel Federation, the Trades Union Congress, the Joint Iron Council andthe National Council of Associated Iron Ore Producers. The Governmenthave also had discussions with a number of trade associations on matters affecting their particular sectors of the industry.4. The Governments proposals, which are set out in the succeedingparagraphs, fall into two parts relating respectively to the transfer of ownership and to public supervision. To deal with the first of these problems,it is proposed to create a Holding and Realisation Agency. The secondwill be the responsibility of a new Iron and Steel Board.II. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIPDissolution of Corporation5. The Bill will provide for the repeal of the Iron and Steel Act, 1949,and for the dissolution of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain.Holding and Realisation Agency     .6. The securities of the nationalised companies now vested in the Cor-poration will be transferred to a Holding and Realisation Agency.7. The Agency, which will be composed of a small number of personspossessing the necessary qualifications and experience, will be appointedby the Treasury.8. The Agency will have the duty to secure the return of these companies to private ownership and meanwhile to ensure their efficient direction, as explained in the ensuing paragraphs.Disposal of Companies9. In disposing of the securities transferred to them from the Corporation,the Agency will be required to obtain the approval of the Treasury in regardto the terms of sales. Subject to similar..Approval, the Agency will have discretion as to the timing. Sales will start as soon as possible after thepassing of the Bill. However in&apos; view of the magnitude of the financialoperations involved, these may well take some years to complete.
10. Before disposal, the Agency may effect such re-groupings of the under-takings or alterations in the capital structure of companies as may bedesirable. The Agency will be required to consult the new Iron and SteelJjgjfird in regard to re-groupings.-lllf 1. tn deciding the price to be asked, regard will be had to all relevant factors at the time of sale: Account will have to be taken of the importantchanges which have taken place since nationalisation in the physical assets,capital structure, reserves and trading prospects of many of the iron and steel companies, together with other considerations such as monetary conditions and the general level of security prices prevailing at the time.12. In allocating securities offered for sale, the Agency will, notwithstand-ing the serious technical difficulties involved, give priority where practicable to applications from former shareholders.Transitional Arrangements13. During the period of transition, the Agency will be empowered withthe approval of the Treasury to provide finance for companies whosesecurities they hold.14. The Agency will exercise their power as shareholders in regard to theappointment of directors of companies but will not intervene in matters of day to day management. It is intended that, pending disposal, companiesowned by the Agency should operate as far as possible on the same footing as their privately owned competitors, and should stand in the same relationshipas-th^arto the Iron and Steel Board.Finance15. The Agency will pay to the Treasury the monies they receive fromsales and dividends. The Treasury will provide such sums as are necessaryto meet the Agency&apos;s outgoings.16. Iron and Steel Stock will become part of the National Debt and willbe re-named 3^ per cent; Treasury Stock, 1979-81.17. The Agency will be empowered to accept this Stock and most other government Stock in payment for securities of iron and steel companiessold by them. Since the sale price will be fixed in relation to conditionscurrent at the time of sale, these Government Stocks will be accepted at theirthen current market value.Report to Parliament18. The Agency will make an annual report to the Treasury who will layit before Parliament.III.   PUBLIC SUPERVISIONIron and Steel Board19. In order to provide public supervision of the iron and steel industry it is proposed to set up an Iron and Steel Board with statutory duties and powers.20. The Board, which will be appointed by the Minister of Supply, will be composed of not more than 12 members. Qualifications for membershipwill include experience in the iron and steel industry, in the engineering andother industries using iron and steel, and in trade unions. There will bean independent chairman and some additional independent members.21. Members of the Board will be appointed for a maximum term of 5 years and will be eligible for re-appointment.16149
Scope of the Board22. It is intended that all the main processes which make up the ironand steel industry, set out in the Appendix, shall come within the purview of the new Board, thus bringing the whole industry again under the suiggpjvision of a single authority and ending the present distinction betvl^/J-nationalised and non-nationalised sectors. The Board will not be concernedwith the extensive engineering and other extraneous activities which, though not part of the iron and steel industry, were brought under the control ofthe Iron and Steel Corporation because they happened to form part of theactivities of the companies which were nationalised.Duties and Powers of the Board23. The Board will have the general duty of supervising the industry with a view to promoting the efficient, economical and adequate supply of iron and steel, and will be required in particular to keep under review :(a) development of production capacity ;(b) prices ;(c) raw material supplies ;(d) research and technical training ;(e) arrangements for joint consultation between management and em-ployees on matters of mutual interest other than wages and condi-tions of service ; and(/) arrangements for the safety, health and welfare of the employees.24. Whilst the powers of the Board are intended to provide for the super-vision of the whole iron and steel industry, they will not extend beyond it,for example to the activities of steel-using industries or metal merchants.25. In times of serious economic difficulty, special measures, such as thepresent emergency powers under Defence Regulations, may be needed todeal with shortages and problems of distribution affecting not only the ironand steel industry but industry as a whole. The action required in such circumstances clearly falls to be taken on a national plane by the Government,and not by a Board responsible for a single industry.26. So long as the present emergency powers or similar powers under other legislation continue to be exercised, the Government will consult theBoard in regard to their application to the iron and steel industry, and inappropriate cases may authorise the Board to exercise them on behalf ofthe Government.Development27. One of the most important responsibilities of the Board will be to supervise capital development. It will be the Board&apos;s duty to discuss with theiron and steel companies their plans, in order that they may be satisfied that individual schemes are consistent with the proper development of-the industry as a whole and that any additional capacity or improved facilities requiredwill be provided.28. If a company should put forward a major scheme which in the opinionof the Board would seriously prejudice the efficient and economical develop-ment of the industry, the Board will have power to restrain that company from embarking upon such a scheme. Companies dissatisfied with theBoard&apos;s decision will have the right of appeal to the Minister of Supply.
29. On grounds of general national interest it may at times be desirableto carry out schemes of capital development which on commercial groundsno company feels able to undertake. It is therefore proposed to give powerstogllhe Minister of Supply to arrange in such cases, after consultation with^/3oard, for the provision and operation of the additional works or other facilities required.30. The Government propose to give these positive powers to the Ministerand not to the Board because, if the Board are to preserve impartialityin the performance of their duty of supervising the industry as a whole, theymust remain free from responsibilities of ownership or management in respect of particular concerns.Prices31. In view of the importance of iron and steel to the national economy, itis proposed to give to the Board power to fix maximum prices for sales inthe United Kingdom. Discretion will be left to-the Board to decide fromtime to time in respect of which products such price control is necessary. Inaddition it is proposed that the Government should have in reserve a powerto intervene in the fixing of maximum iron and steel prices should the publicinterest so require.32. In order to avoid overlapping, the Board&apos;s price-fixing powers willnot be exercisable in respect of any product for which a Price Control order under Defence Regulations is at the time operative. On the other hand,the Minister of Supply will be required to consult the Board before making any such order in respect of any product or raw material of the industry,including scrap.Enforcement of Board&apos;s decisions33. The Bill will provide that all producers of iron and steel shall bedeemed to have entered into a contractual obligation with the Board to observe their decisions in relation to development and prices. The Board&apos;decisions will thus be enforceable by civil proceedings for an injunction.Supply of Raw Materials34. The Board will keep under review the distribution of raw materials,including scrap. In times of shortage, such as the present, when emergency powers are in operation, it is the Governments intention that the board should control the distribution of scarce raw materials within the iron andsteel industry under the authority of the Minister of Supply.35. In view of the dependence of the United Kingdom upon supplies of high grade iron ore and other raw materials from abroad, the Board willhave to assure themselves that the arrangements made by the industry forimportation of the raw materials it requires and their distribution are satis-factory. The Board will be empowered themselves to take steps to securethe imports required, should they consider the industry&apos;s arrangementsinadequate.36. The Board may also if necessary arrange for the import of iron or steel, in finished or semi-finished form.37. In order to avoid serious price discrepancies due to the higher costof imported iron and steel and raw materials, the Board may arrange, withthe approval of the Minister of Supply, for these to be sold below cost andfor the loss to be recovered from appropriate sectors of industry, as is done at present.
Research and Training38. The Board will be empowered to take steps to promote research andthe training and education of employees, should they consider that the indus-try&apos;s arrangements are inadequate, and to make any necessary grants orExpenses of the Board39. The Board will have power to obtain payments from the iron andsteel companies to meet their expenses, including, when necessary, the lossesinvolved in selling imported materials below cost. These payments willbe fixed in accordance with principles to be approved by the Minister, whobefore giving his consent will consider any representations by the companies concerned.Statistics40. The Board will arrange for the periodical publication of statisticsrelating to the industry, and the iron and steel companies will be requiredto furnish any necessary information.Application to Northern Ireland41. The powers relating to prices will apply to sales of iron and steel in Northern Ireland as well as in Great Britain. The other functions ofthe Board may be applied to Northern Ireland upon the request of theNorthern Ireland Parliament.Import Duties42. It is the Governments intention to consult the Board in regard toany proposed modifications to the import duties on iron and steel.Report to Parliament43. The Board will make an annual report to the Minister of Supply, whowill lay it before Parliament.APPENDIXIRON AND STEEL PROCESSES1.
