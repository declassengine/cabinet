Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952SECRET Copy No. 5 7C. (52) 2244th July, 1952CABINETEXPORTS FROM METAL-USING industries memorandum by the Minister of supply have been examining how the metal-using industries could, by expandingtheir exports, make an increased contribution to the solution of the problem of our balance of payments.2. This examination involves detailed discussions with the numerous industries concerned and is not yet completed. However, my colleagues may care to knowmy preliminary conclusions.3. The metal-using industries (excluding shipbuilding) are already exportinggoods to the value of about  1,200 million a year, which represents over 40 per cent,of our total exports.4. If a further expansion of exports from these industries is to be obtained,three measures require to be taken:  (a) Increased quantities of military equipment of types already in production for the Services should be released for export;(b) the production of selected items in the defence programme should be cur-tailed or spread over a longer period in places where this will releasecapacity and labour which is capable of being switched over to exportwork within the same factory;(c) more steel should be allocated to firms which are in a position to expandtheir exports.5. Action under course (a) offers the possibility of the quickest results. Exportsof military equipment against orders already received will amount to about  20million in non-sterling currencies during the second, half of this year and about 33 million next year. Over and above this, we have received specific enquiries from non-sterling countries worth about  37 million for equipment which in the maincould be supplied during the next 18 months without interfering appreciably withdeliveries to the Services.6. These figures relate only to equipment for which the Ministry of Supply-is responsible. They include no allowance for the off-shore purchase of aircraft by the United States which, if the present negotiations are successful, might bring in substantial progress payments in dollars in 1953. Nor has any account beentaken of the additional enquiries which would be stimulated by the knowledge thatwe were now in the position to supply more arms, and which might well result in exports worth a further  17 million to non-sterling countries over the next18 months. (The detailed figures on which these estimates are based are given at Appendix A.)7. I have referred above only to exports to non-sterling countries. As will beseen from the table in Appendix A there are also prospects of a substantial expan-sioh of exports to the sterling area. An appreciable proportion of these sterlingexports would in fact be &quot;dollar-savers,&quot; in that they would replace dollar imports by the countries concerned.42513 b
c.p..8. The results to be expected from course (b) would not be so immediate.However, if the necessary policy decisions are taken this month, the benefits should^already begin to be felt before the end of the year. For maximum benefit to bfcderived from the proposed diversions of steel, it is important that the firms shouldbe given the earliest possible authority to seek additional export orders. any delay would prejudice our prospects in the buyers&apos; markets which are now develop-ing abroad. (Examples of products whose export could be expanded by switchingcapacity within the same factories from defence to civil production, are given at appendix B.)9. The impact of action under course (c) would be rather more gradual, but its effect during 1953 could be very considerable. In order to release the steelrequired for this purpose, it will be necessary to accept some postponement of cer-tain parts of the defence programme which consume steel most heavily. But thisby itself will not be enough. Within the civil sector of the economy, a furtherdiversion of steel to production for exports would certainly be necessary as well.A start should be made at once. In the fourth quarter of the year, at least an extra150,000 tons of steel should be allocated to engineering industries capable ofincreasing their exports. (A list of the main industries concerned is attached at appendix C.)10.   I accordingly recommend:  (i) that the Service and Supply Departments, in revising their defence pro-duction programmes, should have in mind the specific object of assistingexports in the ways suggested in paragraph 4 (a) and (b) above;(ii) that, in the case of selected items of defence equipment with good exportprospects, the production programmes should not be reduced to thefull extent required by the cuts contemplated in Service expenditure,thus leaving a margin available for sale abroad;(iii) that in the fourth quarter of this year at least an additional 150,000 tonsof steel should be allocated to firms capable of expanding their exportsquickly.D.

Exports of Defence Equipment(Explanatory Notes)Aircraft1. The orders received for aircraft shown in Columns 1 and 4 of the abovetable relate mainly to obsolescent types of jet aircraft (e.g., Vampire, Meteor,Venom), and piston-engined machines (e.g., Chipmunk, Bristol Freighter), aero-engines and accessory equipment. Most of these exports will be to N.A.T.O.and Commonwealth countries, but there are also substantial orders from such countries as Switzerland, Sweden, Iraq and Venezuela. Having regard to the impending cuts in Service expenditure, they could probably be provided withoutany very appreciable interference with deliveries to the Royal Air Force. the values shown relate mainly to firm orders approved by the Government, but they also include a few requirements approved but not yet covered by contract, andone or two requirements not yet formally approved but on which no difficulty isexpected.2. The estimate of  8 million for further possible orders (Column 7) relatesalmost entirely to Canberras, Venoms and Meteors. This figure could be increasedwere it not for the restrictions upon exports to certain countries, such as Egypt.3. The latest information from N.A.T.O. suggests that we shall receive orders from the United States for the off-shore purchase of at least 360 Swifts worth 25 million. This may be improved upon as a result of the discussions to be heldshortly in Washington. Advance payments are likely to be received during thenext 18 months, but no account is taken of these in the table, which relates todeliveries of finished equipment.A mmunition4. Exports of ammunition to non-sterling countries shown in Columns 1and 4 relate in the main to off-shore orders received from the United States for-300 in., 90 mm. and 155 mm. ammunition and 3-5 in. rockets; In addition,the sale of Centurion tanks will give rise to further substantial orders forammunition.Armoured Vehicles5. Of the Centurions required by Canada, 110 have been included underColumn 1 as a firm order for 1952 and 145 under Column 5 as a specific enquiryfor 1953.       &apos;6. Since the contracts have not yet been signed, the Centurions for off-shorepurchase by the United States are shown as enquiries under Columns 2 and 5.135 have been included for 1952 and 200 for 1953. The total order is for 535.Our rate of production would permit earlier deliveries of the balance.7. The table also takes into account orders and enquiries for Centuriontanks from Australia, Pakistan and other sterling countries.Wheeled Vehicles \ -&apos; ;8. There will be substantial orders for vehicles for Belgium under the DraperPlan. These are not shown under the heading of &quot;Wheeled Vehicles,&quot; but areincluded in the total shown for the Draper Plan as a whole.9. In estimating other possible orders allowance has been made in Column 7for the fact that part of the expected demand will have been met under the DraperPlan. The figure of  15 million is made up mainly of 1-with and 3-ton G.S. Lorries,the British Jeep, and civil types, which are more or less interchangeable, for whichthere are known to be requirements in many countries.Miscellaneous10. The  12 million shown in Column 7 under the heading &apos;; Miscellaneous &quot;as possible orders from the sterling area is an estimate to cover some of theAustralian requirements presented by Mr. Menzies as well as requirements fromother Commonwealth countries.
11.   The  5 million for the non-sterling area is an allowance for possiblef , additional off-shore orders out of the United States 1953 appropriation.The Draper Plan12. Exports under the Draper Plan cannot be sub-divided. The Belgians haveagreed to take $25 million of equipment from the United Kingdom by 30th June,1954, but the list of stores has not yet been finally agreed.Electronics13. The main electronic products, for which contracts have been placed or are being negotiated, are radar sets A.A. No. 3 Mk. 7 and sonobuoys. enquiries are now being received for a wide range of other electronic equipment.APPENDIX BSwitch Over of Capacity from Defence Orders to civil Exports within Factories1. Many firms with substantial defence orders are also manufacturing civilproducts for export. Some of these firms could increase their exports quickly if their defence orders were reduced. The English Electric Company is an example.Within their Preston factory they are both making Canberra bombers and diesel-electric rolling stock for export. Some lightening of their Canberra programme would enable them to divert labour and factory capacity to their civil work andwould quickly be reflected in increased exports.2. In the motor industry firms such as Albion, A.E.C., Leylands, Scammelland Thornycroft could probably increase their exports of heavy commercial vehiclesfor which there is a good market overseas, if Service orders were reduced or spreadover a longer period. Similarly the Austin Company would be able to export/British Jeeps if the War Office were able to accept a reduced rate of deliveries tothem.3. In the electronics field certain firms (such as Marconi, E.M.I., S.T.C.,G.E.C., and B.T.H.) which have important defence orders are also exporters ofcapital equipment. If the defence load upon them were lightened, they would beable to give earlier delivery of export orders and attract increased overseas business.4. Exports could also be assisted by some reduction in the defence orders forEngineer stores, much of which, if not identical, is very similar to civil productsmade by the same firms for export. These include contractors&apos; plant, cranes, diesellocomotives, cistern wagons and other heavy equipment. .
