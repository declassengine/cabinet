I have prepared the attached papersbefore the week-end, though I myself, and no doubt all closely concerned,will wish to spend the next two days in further thought.   It will be noted that my memorandum includes the message from the Governor of the Bank ofEngland which gives urgency to the question.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.,28TH JUNE, 1952.EXTERNAL STERLING PLAN1. At the end of last February, I proposed to my colleagues a major change in external financial policy which became known as the ExternalSterling Plan.   After a thorough discussion, the Cabinet decided not to proceedwith the Plan at that time.2. I have since received the following message from the Governor ofthe Bank of England:-x &quot;In various talks since that time and in my memorandum of6th May, I have expressed the view that, while measures takenin your Budget and the rise in the Bank Rate had had considerable effect on the exchanges, the improvement could not wisely beregarded as setting an end to our troubles;  that the crust was thinand that we could not continue long on the present basis withoutrisking the re-emergence of pressure against sterling.&quot;As I said to you this morning, the signs are now all pointingto a gradual reappearance of this pressure (not, happily, at present on the sort of scale experienced in the months before your budget statement).   It is impossible to give exact reasons or to predictexact developments.   But world financial opinion is beginning once again to believe that it is risky to acquire or hold sterling at present rates and in present conditions, and that a short position in sterlingis unlikely to lead to loss but may well lead to profit.x   Extract from letter dated21st June, 1952.&apos; -1- *
&quot;In these circumstances I feel it my duty to lay before you the Bank&apos;s view that a decision to allow our arrangements inthese fields to remain substantially unchanged over the summer months would involve a grave risk to the currency and therefore to the economy of the United Kingdom and the Sterling Area. &quot;3. In the four months since the beginning of March we have had a welcome respite in the losses from the gold reserves, and the loss for thepresent quarter will be much smaller than I advised my colleagues to expecttwo months ago in C. (52) 111.   This has resulted partly from the confidencecreated by the Budget, particularly by the credit measures, which have ledto abnormal receipts (chiefly the payment of overdue bills), and partly from thevery rapid inflow of Defence Aid from the United States.4. I have never concealed my view, however, either from my colleaguesor from the House of Commons, that the respite has been only a temporaryone.   The latest forecasts of our situation in the second half of this year which I presented in C. (52) 195 show that the value of the measures taken in theBudget cannot last indefinitely, and that the other Sterling Area countries willnot be able to achieve the targets set at the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos;Meeting.   At some time in the next few months there may therefore well be aresurgence of the crisis of confidence in sterling with which we have beenbattling ever since we came into office.   I do not myself claim that ourpowers of prediction in this field can be absolutely accurate, but I mustrecord the result of the official calculations and of the impressions I have beenable to get of the state of opinion outside.5. Stern measures on defence, imports, etc. are necessary in any case.Yet the hard fact remains that the gold reserves have fallen so low, both inrelation to the turnover of transactions and in relation to our sight liabilities,that we can continue our present external financial system only at great risk to ourselves and to the Sterling Area.   Our capital position is too weak.On our present basis, we can never know from one week to anotherwhether some new adverse turn of events will not place the reserves and so thewhole system in jeopardy.6. Furthermore, this is not a passing phase.   It will obviously be along time before we can build up the gold reserves by earning a substantialgold and dollar surplus.   The amounts which we could borrow through the channels which are at present open to us are small in relation to the size ofthe reserves which we need to feel reasonably protected, and in any case itis wrong to borrow and pledge securities without a positive policy for rightingthe difficulties which give rise to the need for borrowing.7. Can we find a way of running our affairs without taking the wholestrain of the balance of payments of the whole sterling area upon our whollyinadequate reserves?8. I have set out in the Appendix the essential features of a Plan onthe same lines as that submitted before.   It is a combination of a floating rateof exchange, convertibility of sterling in the market for people outside the sterling area, and holding action on the sterling balances.   The maindifference between this and the former plan is that the present one containsno provision for the formal funding of the sterling balances of sterling area countries, since this does not now seem to be necessary (see paragraph 19below).
Illf9. The Plan in the Appendix presupposes that we should aim atkeeping the rate of exchange as stable as possible by constructive use ofthe reserves.   The Government would have power to decide from time totime whether or not to use the reserves to support the rate; but our reserves are not large enough to enable us to support a rate which is clearly unreal.If it were agreed that the plan should go forward, I would pursue enquiriesabout securing a line of credit from the International Monetary Fund (I. M. F. )to be announced, if possible, concurrently with the Plan.10, I now come to the timing of any plan such as the attached.   Ithas emerged from discussion with my advisers, and in particular with theGovernor of the Bank of England, that the time for a change is now ratherthan later. The position cannot be better in three months1 time than it is now.It may well be worse. Furthermore, the annual meeting of the I, M, F, inSeptember is bound to give cause to a great deal of speculative talk whichcould be damaging to us. We still have a chance of making a change in circumstances which: -(a) will show that we are taking a positive step and not acting fromweakness;(b) will give a change the best chance of success by announcing stronginternal action at the same time;(c) will provide sufficient time for consultation with the commonwealth and others.I am bound to warn my colleagues that some action is necessary and that ifwe delay action, we run a grave risk that we shall have to make a change inthe worst possible circumstances, i. e. when we are forced into it by a crisiswith no adequate time to consult.   We have to weigh the value of positive action,with all its risks, against the great objections of appearing to be forced into action.11. I must make it quite clear that I do not regard this plan as a meansof righting our current balance of payments.   If adopted, it should in due course have favourable effects upon the whole sterling area&apos;s current balance ofpayments with the rest of the world, for if the pound falls this will tend to discourage foreign exchange expenditure of all kinds, not only in the UnitedKingdom but also in the rest of the Sterling Area.   This would also be a stimulus to our competitive power and to exports.   Thus, the operation would act upon the whole of the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments and not merelyon the United Kingdom&apos;s imports.   The main purpose of the Plan would be to change our external financial system in a way which would enable us tocontinue without these crises - it deals with the capital position, so to speak,and not with the current position.12. But obviously the Plan if it is adopted could not be allowed to fail.   It is absolutely necessary to reduce the overload on the economy andto help to put right the current balance of payments, whether we adopt the Planor not.   But I could not recommend the Plan unless it were accompanied by:-(a) definite and effective reductions in the Defence Programme;(b) an adaptation of the investment programme, putting more emphasis on productive industry and less on social investment, includinghousing;(c) some reduction in imports.
It will be understood that the value of the above steps depends uponthe manner and time of their announcement.I am advised that the measures already taken in the field of monetary policy are working well and that any upward movement in the Bank Rate wouldmake the wrong impression on confidence.13. I must make quite clear to my colleagues also that this plan would involve risks and dangers which we should not underestimate. It iscertainly true, however, that events since last February have reduced the risks which we should have to run.14. On the internal side, there are two main elements of risk, bothof them fundamental to the nature of the Plan:-(i)  The danger that the rate will fall so far that it will lead to a rapid increase in the prices of imports, particularly food.   This mighthave serious political and social repercussions, especially in thisperiod of wage claims.(ii)   The danger that the effect of sterling becoming convertible would beto cause other countries to discriminate against our exports -a process which would lead us to retaliate by cutting out our imports from them - and thus to a general downward spiral of world trade in which we should lose exports and would consequently suffer unemployment.The impact of these difficulties might well not arise immediately.15. On the first of these risks, I would not be prepared to make aprediction of the extent to which the rate would move in the near future.This is likely to be governed as much by capital factors as by current.   It is nevertheless true to say that, although there is a very large prospective deficit in relation to our reserves, the deficit is not large in relation to the total volume of transactions.   Furthermore, even if sterling were to depreciateby as much as 10% against all other currencies, the impact on the cost ofliving index would not be more than an increase of 1^%.16. The danger of loss of &quot;less essential&quot; exports arising fromdiscrimination against us is a real one, but the extent of it should not beoverestimated.   The risk really relates to that part of our trade - about one-third of the whole - which goes neither to the sterling area nor to the dollar area - and within this amount to that part of these exports which consists of&quot;less essentials&quot;.   Our trade policy might have to be adapted to meet this danger.17. In this connection, I should refer to the effect of the Plan upon ourworld oil trade.  As the world price of oil tends to be the dollar price, anydepreciation of sterling against the dollar would increase our sterling earningsper ton of oil sold.  Against this advantage, however, must be placed the likelihood that concessionary Governments such as Iraq and Kuwait would putforward demands for a revision of the terms of their concessions in order toprotect themselves against the fluctuations in the value of sterling; we shouldalmost certainly have to concede these demands in some degree.18. The other dangers which appeared most serious when the cabinet considered the Plan in February were the impact on the Commonwealth andthe impact on Europe.
19. Let me consider the Commonwealth first.   The version of the plan in the Appendix will create much less difficulty than the previous one wouldhave done.   The different treatment of sterling balances would be very helpful to Commonwealth countries.   All that they would be required to doabout their sterling balances would be to co-operate with us in producing an agreed assessment of the extent to which the balances represent a &quot;sightliability&quot; upon the United Kingdom economy.   It should not be difficult toagree with them a statement showing that the immediate burden of the balances is a comparatively small fraction of what the outside world has cometo believe.   The sterling release agreements with India, Pakistan and Ceylonwill remain unchanged under the new proposal.   We should be able to give theGovernments of the sterling Commonwealth rather longer to consider theproposals than was possible before, in the hope that it would be possible to announce the scheme as having their full support.20. We must now consider our European partners.   Our immediate with-drawal from the European Payments Union has always been one of the most difficult implications of any move to provide convertibility.   In the last four months, however, a great deal cf thought has been given to this problem inEurope, and the ideas both of an early step towards convertibility and a floating rate have been ventilated much more fully than they had been previously.   I think it is very likely that France and Belgium at any rate,and perhaps others, would follow any lead given by us.   There may be indeeda possibility of concerted action over quite a wide field in Europe, and if theplan were adopted by us, it would be possible to have prior consultations withthe French, Belgians and Scandinavians in time to permit them to concert with us.   Prior consultation with the Germans would also be desirable after theUnited States Government had been informed.   It would, of course, be very muchin our interest that all these countries should act at the same time, and itwould greatly reduce the danger of loss of trade through discrimination against us.21. Despite all its dangers, one great advantage of the Plan is that ithas strong constructive possibilities and offers hope of fruitful collaboration with our partners in the Commonwealth and in Western Europe on lines whichcan lead, with American co-operation, to making sterling an effective currency.22. In conclusion I would say this.   I believe that we need a concertedplan of action to improve our Balance of Payments and that such action mustbe launched in the right psychological atmosphere.   If any alternative actionwhich would achieve these ends can be suggested, I should be very glad toconsider it.   So far I am not aware of any alternative which is satisfactory.R.A.B,Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1. ,28TH JUNE, 1952.
APPENDIXr-t Main Features of the External Sterling Plan(This is in a form suitable for inclusion in a telegram to theCommonwealth).1.      The Plan consists of six parts:-(a) As from , sterling currently earned by countries outside, the sterling area (which will be designated as &quot;external sterling&quot;) will become convertible,(b) The nominal official parity of sterling will remain at$2.89 but no attempt will be made to maintain the existingmargin of $2.78 to $2.82.     We shall use the gold and dollar reserves, held by our Exchange Equalisation Account, to inter-vene constructively in the exchange market so as to secure themaximum stability in the rate at a level consistent with thereal international value of sterling.     For your own infor-mation we shall seek initially to keep the rate within limits/to be defined/ so long as this does not dangersousLy weaken the reserves, but you should know that this intention will not bemaie public or revealed to anyone (repeat anyone) exceptfor the narrowest possible circle of the U.K. and Commonwealthfinancial authorities.(c) The London gold market will be reopened and gold will betraded in a free market against external sterling, dollars, andether currencies at prices fluctuating according to supply and demand, and not in any way tied to the U.S. official price forgold.(d) The sterling balances of non-residents (repeat non-residents)in the sterling area will &quot;be frozen sufficiently to prevent any appreciable offerings of such balances of the London market in exhange for dollars or other wanted currencies.     The following steps will be taken:(i)    Up to  1,000 could be transferred to External SterlingAccount;    this would dispose of de mlnimis cases.(ii)    The balances Would be available for meeting pre-zerocommitments, on a restricted basis.(iii)   Foreign commercial and central &quot;banks could transferagreed sums to External Sterling Account as workingbalances.(iv)    The remainder of the balances could be invested inquoted securities with a life exceeding ten years,such securities (or any balances not so invested)being blocked.(v)    All existing balances on American and Canadian Accounts(for which we are already liable to provide dollars)will be transferred to External Sterling Accounts.&apos;(e) The present structure of the sterling area would be main-tained.      Countries in the area would retain full exchange/control
control and sterling area residents would still need authority from their governments to acquire foreign currencies in themarket for purchases outside the area.    payments betweensterling area countries would not, cf course,  involve the^guse of external sterling.    it is essential for the successsfpof the scheme that all currencies within the area should maintain a stable exchange rate with sterling,  though notnecessarily at the existing parity.(f)    in order to convince the wcrlfl that the exchange valueof sterling will not &quot;lee subject to constant depreciationunder the weight of an excess of sterling, it is an essential part of the scheme to show that only a small proportion ofthe sterling balances represents effective -eight liabilities of the u.k.    from sub-paragraph (d) above it will be -seenhow drastically we propose to treat the balances of non-sterling area countries.^form of statement we require from the sterling areagovernments.    this is still under consideration - seeparagraph iff of covering memorandum^
