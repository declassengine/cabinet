Twits about the similarityof present techniques to those used by the previous Administration do notdeter me from the duty of holding the ring fairly between some ministers who are ready to face the undoubted fact that our resources are limited andthat our need for exports is absolutely vital and others who would makeunlimited calls on those resources for reasons which may be perfectlyhonourable but which are not consistent with our aim of paying our way.The recent trade returns show how essential it is that our exports should beincreased.   If we are to carry out our recent undertaking that Balanceof Payments comes first we must adhere to a method of measuring our resources and assessing how much of them can be spared for investmentat home.     A bigger investment programme may be superficially attractivebut the hard fact is that it would add to our import bill and draw away moreresources of man-power and materials from exports and uses which would increase exports.   It would also mean a heavier taxation and strain on theBudget or an increase in inflationary pressure.   In either event, the balanceof payments - which I think we all agree is vital at the present time -would inevitably suffer.2. We have already agreed that productive investment must be raisedabove its present level, and so investment in the social sector will have tbe moderated until we have gathered more strength.3. The size of the problem is indicated in the following table, which shows in column 1 the substantial gap between the probable output of new building work and the screened requirements submitted by Departments (thefull requirements would be much bigger):New Building Work:Requirements  m.Col. 1 Col. 2Defence (a) Ministry of Defence 133 133(b) Civil Departments 33 18Housing 416 416Other Civil Investment 480 4201061 987Availability 900 900Deficit 161 87-1-secret.

: ;A&apos;hic assumes that the output of the building industry can reach.  900 millions,excluding repairs and maintenance which are estimated to take  700 millions.This is considerably more than it has ever done before as the following figures show:-1948       1949       1 950       1951       1952Value of new building work(end 1951 prices) 750 775 825 810 874 (estimated)4. My colleagues have agreed that the &quot;other civil investment&quot;(civil investment other than housing) shown in this table should not take morethan  420 millions, of which  100 millions should be for building forproductive industry.   This allows an increase in industrial building over thepresent rate of  77 millions for 1952.   This is certainly a move in the right direction.   If we are to develop our exporting power and improve our competitiveefficiency we must clearly expand our industrial investment.   There is nodoubt that industry would be prepared to do more than is possible with an allocation of  100 millions, but it would be impracticable to make cutselsewhere big enough to allow more for manufacturing industry.   To make theexpansion to  100 millions possible it is necessary to limit development inthe nationalised industries and other civilian fields and, as I am suggestinglater, to reduce or postpone the requirements of the services.   Even so it willbe necessary for the economic Departments to concentrate industrial building on those projects which are likely to help our exports most,5. The first table in paragraph 3 above shows in Column 2 that withother civil investment limited to  420 millions and with civil defenceinvestment reduced to  18 millions, there is still a deficit of  87 millions.The Minister of Housing has suggested that we should expand the buildingindustry and so have    a larger output from it.   If economic health alonewere our objective, we ought at this moment to be doing less building for social purposes, not more.   If we do not solve our balance of payments problem, this course will be forced upon us by events.     I well realise that we are publicly committed to building 300,000 houses.   I come later tomy suggestions for reaching this as best we can considering the resources available.  Meanwhile, in order to fill the deficit of  87 millions in 1953,I propose that both the Defence Works programme and the Housing programme should be rolled forward, so that expenditure in 1953 does not exceedthat approved for 1952.Defence6. I have already discussed with the Service Ministers, who have beenvery helpful, a proposal on which I think we may be able to reach agreementtogether, for a Defence Works Programme amounting to  110 millions, which includes the full programme for the United States Air Force.   This would contribute a saving of  23 millions towards meeting the deficit.   I haveagreed with them that a final decision on the defence figure can wait until we have the report on the costings of the Forces, which will be ready shortly.Housing7. The housing investment figure for 1952 is  372 millions, of which 330 millions is for England and Wales and  42, millions for Scotland,With the same quantities of steel and timber as are appropriate to this figure
Wtid within the same money limit the Minister of Housing would be free to building 1953 as many houses as he can.   He has already shown great ingenuity in theeconomical use of materials.   By building a larger proportion of smallerhouses, or by reducing standards and by encouraging the use of economicalmethods of construction to save imported materials, and without reducingexports of cement below 1. 9 million tons, I do not doubt that the Ministerof Housing would find ways of building in 1953 more than 230,000 houseswith the money, men and imported materials we can afford.8, If these proposals are agreed, then I could meet the Minister of housing on another of his points, and would recommend that he should havea single investment programme for all the purposes for which his ministry is responsible, and should have discretion to sub-divide the total in the proportions he thinks fit.   This would give him a figure of  366 millions for investment in England and Wales in 1953.9, The Minister also makes the point that where houses have been started, they cannot be stopped, and I agree;  but I hope that he will help to meet the emergency by matching his future programme to the resources available, in the way I have suggested above.   I recognise that he will need to explain to local authorities that they will have to expect the tenders for new houses submitted by them to be approved at a slower rate for some months010. I ask my colleagues to agree that:-(i)  The overriding importance of the balance of payments makes itnecessary to restrict new building investment in 1953 to  900millions.(ii)   The Defence Works Programme should be rolled forward so that expend!ture in 1953 does not exceed that approved for 1952, i. e. Defence 110 millions (including  20 millions for the U. S.A. F.) and civil Defence  14 millions.   The defence figure would be iprovisional, and subject to further scrutiny when the report onthe costings of the Forces is available.(iii)   The Housing Programme should be rolled forward so that expenditurein 1953 does not exceed  330 millions in England and Wales(subject to (iv) below) and  42 millions in Scotland.(iv)   The Minister of Housing should be free to treat his share of thetotal Housing programme (i. e.   330 millions) together with hisshare of investment in &quot;other civil building&quot; (i. e.   36 millions),as a single programme (totalling  366 millions) and should have discretion to sub-divide this total in the proportions he thinks fit.(v)   &quot;Other civil uew Building&quot; should be  420 millions, of which 100 millions should be for building for productive industry0R.
