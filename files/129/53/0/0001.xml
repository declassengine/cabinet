this document is the property of her britannic majestys  governmentoPrinted for the Cabinet.   Jane 1.952SECRET Copy No.   73C. (52) 201 Y18th June, 1952CABINETTHE DOLLAR GAP: FOOD imports memorandum by the Minister of food have already circulated to my colleagues a note by my Scientific Adviser onthe adequacy of our national diet (C. (52) 200). There are certain matters relatingto supplies of basis foods which arise immediately on the Report by the programmes committee circulated by the Chancellor (C. (52) 195) and which I think the cabinet should have before them in discussing the situation described in the Chancellor^memorandum.Danish Bacon and Eggs Contracts2. Paragraph 8 of the Supplementary Note to the Report by the programmes committee refers to the consequences of eliminating from the Programme altogetherthe uncommitted purchases of rationed foods amounting to  24 million. the paragraph refers in the last sentence to the reprisals which would be provoked if wecompletely stopped the import of Danish bacon and eggs.3. Almost from the very day that Denmark was liberated the United kingdom has done its best to encourage the Danes, by means of the guarantees containedin the long-term contracts for butter, bacon and eggs, once again to base their agricultural production upon this market. Through the Danish bacon and eggindustries alone the Danish economy is now linked to ours to the tune of some 50 million worth of reciprocal trade per annum, and even to hint at putting an end to this now would cause a very grave shock to our relations with a particularlyfriendly country and would undoubtedly provoke reprisals against our exports.These purchases are, therefore, only uncommitted in the sense that the existing contracts terminate in September and to the extent that we may be prepared toplace limits upon our future purchases and face the consequences. The economic policy Committee (E.A. (52) 13th Meeting) approved, in principle, my proposalto negotiate further contracts covering the procurement of bacon for two yearsand eggs for one year from Denmark.4. I understand that the Chancellor is inclined to the view that a ceilinglimitation ought to be imposed on the quantities of bacon we take from Denmark.The contract which expires at the end of September next committed the Danes tosupply and us to buy 90 per cent, of their export surplus, and I would like to conclude a two-year contract on a similar basis.5. In the contract year 1952-53., in addition to supplies from Denmark (about140,000 tons), we should also receive 30,000 tons from Holland, and perhaps40,000 tons from Poland, and this, in addition to some 280,000 tons of home supplies,would give us a total of nearly 500,000 tons and would enable us, I hope, although not too confidently, to maintain an average ration of 5 6z., of which the Danishsupplies would provide about 1  oz. and are, therefore, of crucial importance. Onthe basis of pre-war consumption, and making allowance for the increase in popu-lation, our best estimate is that bacon cannot be freed from control and rationinguntil supplies of at least 600,000 tons are secure. It is true that in the recentAgricultural White Paper there was foreshadowed a substantial increase in the home supplies of pigmeat, but this is all desperately needed in support of the meat ration,42425
and in any case without .an expansion of bacon-curing capacity, of which therecan be no hope in the near future because of the limitation on the investment programme, we could not make any more bacon in the United Kingdom. Thereis no prospect at present of our making up the deficiency from overseas and if weplace, a ceiling upon bacon imports even at the estimated level of 1953, we shailundoubtedly get less and we shall certainly condemn ourselves to the aeeeptanceof bacon rationing until the end of that year. The discouragement to pig productionin Denmark which must inevitably be involved, will, I believe, put off the decontrolof bacon for two or three years. -   -WVVv &apos;&quot;&apos;6. As for Danish eggs, these too are of very great importance from the supplyangle. 25 per cent, of our supplies in the winter period come from Denmark.Those supplies are notoriously meagre, and any further decline could not fail toexcite a great deal of dissatisfaction. The Danes are exploiting other markets,particularly West Germany, and we have already in the past been compelled toaccept a reduced percentage of their exportable surplus. The contract I have inmind is for -one year- only and I should like to negotiate for 75 per cent, of their export surplus as was done last year.Butter and Fats Ration7. Paragraph 8 of the Supplementary Note to. which I have referred sets out the consequences, so far as butter and fats are concerned, of our droppingaltogether the uncommitted purchases of these commodities. I should like to makeit clear, however, that, even if we purchase all the butter which is uncommitted, the butter ration will have to come down later in the year, and that I included in theImport Programme, as it stands at present, the purchase of sufficient oils and oil-seeds to enable me to offset the reduction of the butter ration by an increase inthe margarine ration so as to keep the total fats ration at 9 oz. per week.8. For more than two years up to September 1951 the total fats ration was never less than 10 oz. per week and consumption of edible oils in food manufacturestood at about 330,000.tons per annum. On 9th September, 1951, the ration was reduced to 9 oz. and as a result of our import cuts in November consumption ofedible oils in manufacture was reduced to rather less than 250,000 tons. The current9-oz. ration is made up of 4 oz. margarine, 3 oz. butter and 2 oz. cooking fat.9. As a result of reduced supplies, mainly from Australia, the butter part ofthe fats ration must be reduced in August to 2 oz. for 16 weeks. In compensationI should like to increase the margarine ration to 5 oz. for the same period. Thiswould cost about  2 million in non-dollar, non-sterling currency. Against thiswould be set savings in respect of butter not already taken into account in theImport Programme amounting to about  1 million.10. I appreciate the Chancellor^ difficulties in the light of the current balanceof payments situation, but I have felt bound to bring to the notice of my colleagues the serious consequences of introducing limitations upon our purchases of Danishbacon and eggs and of cutting out of the Import Programme the provision forpurchasing oils and fats to make up for the coming reduction in the butter ration.Progress with these matters has now been delayed for some weeks pending the submission of the Import Programme to Ministers. If our bacon and eggs supplies from Denmark for the next year or two are not to be impaired, I should let the danes know almost at once that I am prepared to negotiate fresh contracts withthem of a kind which will keep up their production for this market and, unless Ibegin to make purchases of oils and fats in the immediate future, it will be too late to get the supplies to this country to avoid a reduction in the total fats ration.G.LL.-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. I,18th June, 1952.
