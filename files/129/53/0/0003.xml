14(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 203 COPY NO.    VgJUNE 18, 1952.CABINETRECOGNITION OF,POST. OFFICE STAFF ASSOCIATIONS:REPORT OF THE TERRINC-TON committee memorandum by the Postmaster general  submit for my colleagues&apos; consideration the following text of astatement which I propose to make in Parliament on Wednesday, June 25.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.JUNE 18, 1952.I have carefully considered the Report and am very grateful to Lord Terrington and the members of the Committee for their detailed examination of the problems set before them and for the able way in which theyhave presented all the complicated factors giving rise to those problems.   Havingcarefully followed their arguments, however, the comments furnished by theStaff Sides of the Post Office Whitley Councils and by interested Staff Associations,I am not willing to impose the recommendations of the Report.   Any bigorganisation such as the Post Office is stronger for having well organised and responsible trades unions to deal with.   Moreover, and more important thanadministrative convenience, the dual recognition of rivaJ unions has a very bad effect on staff relations and on the public service.   On the other hand, as  minister in charge of a Government Department I am most reluctant to become involved in questions on how unions should be organised -N indeed I see realobjections to this in principle and serious dangers in practice.   I should indeednot be surprised if the trade union movement itself, on mature reflection,   came to feel serious misgivings on these points.   From the point of view of PostOffice staff as a whole and of the public and trade unions generally, it is most desirable that a dispute of this kind should be settled by the staff themselves and not put to the Minister for decision.2. I do not therefore propose to form a final vi2w on the matter inpresent circumstances.   I am convinced that yet further effort should first bemade by the staff themselves to reach a settlement, whether on the lines recommended by the Terrington Committee or otherwise, before I am called uponto consider the matter further.   Accordingly, I intend to suspend considerationuntil the early part of next year in order to give the parties concerned the fullest
possible opportunity to settle their own differences.   Each has a responsibility not only to their members but to the public service generally,and I would hope that the respective National Executive Committees would get together with the firm determination of reaching a mutually satisfactory arrangement.   It will, of course, be appreciated that if this matter remainsunresolved I would need to consider very carefully in the light of all the relevant factors where the public interest lies, but I should by then have theadvantage of knowing the outcome of any further discussions that will havetaken place between the organisations.There is cne Staff Association which is in a quite differentposition from any other, and which I propose to recognise forthwith.   Thisis the Telephone Sales Supervising Officers&apos; Association, which claims to have in membership over 90% of the staff concerned.   No other organisation is recognised or claims recognition for these grades, and the alternative to the recognition of this Association would therefore be to leave them without anyrecognised representation whatsoever, which would be quite unjustifiable.
