this document is the property of her britannic  majesty&apos;s  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1952CONFIDENTIALC (52) 21224th June, 1952Copy No,66CABINETSCOTTISH AFFAIRS rMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i ask my colleagues to agree that we should:  (1) make a return of revenue from, and expenditure in relation to, Scotlandand the rest of the United Kingdom; and(2) recommend to The Queen the appointment of a Royal Commission-&quot; to review, with reference to the financial, economic, administrative and other considerations involved, the arrangements for exercising thefunctions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to Scotland, and toreport.&quot;I. Return of Revenue and Expenditure2. A strong committee, presided over by Lord Catto, was appointed by thelate Government to consider whether a return of Scottish revenue and expenditure and of Scotland&apos;s balance of trade could be prepared. A summary of the. mainconclusions of their Report, which will be ready for publication before the summer recess, is attached. The Report shows that a return of revenue and expenditure is possible and sets out the way in which it could be drawn up. It shows also whyan economic balance sheet for Scotland is not practicable.3. I recognise that a return of Scottish revenue and expenditure will put agood deal of work on the Treasury and other departments and that this is a difficulttime to undertake it. But I see no alternative. The pressure for it from both sides of the House will, in my view, be irresistible. I propose, therefore, that we should say at once that we will prepare and lay in 1953 a return on the lines laid down inthe Catto Report. We should at the same time avoid any suggestion of making anannual return, and I would accordingly propose that it should be made clear thatany question as to the future of the return would be decided in the light of the reception it gets, the practical use made of it, and the expense and labour involvedin its compilation.II.--Royal Commission4. We undertook in our 1949 policy statement &quot; Scottish Control of scottish affairs &quot; to set up a Royal Commission &quot; to review the whole situation betweenScotland and England in the light of modern developments, and to make recom-mendations.&quot; In our pre-Election statement &quot; Britain Strong and Free&quot; wereaffirmed the 1949 undertaking, saying that our policy included &quot; the appointmentof a Royal Commission to review the economic relationship between England and scotland together with other important issues.&quot; Since then, in reply to questions in Parliament, I have undertaken to consider the terms of reference of the Royal42459
Commission as soon as the Report of the Catto Committee has been considered;and the Prime Minister, in reply to. a question by Mr. Lewis on 7th May, said:.-gli&quot; As the Honourable Member knows, we intend to recommend that a^^Royal Commission should be appointed. Consideration of its scope must.  : await the Report of the Committee presided over by Lord Catto which isinvestigating the economic and financial relations between Scotland and therest of the United Kingdom.&quot;I am clear, therefore, that a Royal Commission must be appointed. If so, thequestions for consideration are (a) what should be the Commission^ terms.of refer-ence, (b) when should it be set up, and (c) who should be its members?(a) Terms of Reference5. There are two questions which I think must clearly be excluded. First, itwould be inappropriate to ask a Royal Commission to consider the case for and against a Scottish Parliament and I have already said that this is a matter for parliament itself. Secondly, in view of the findings of the Catto Committee, thereis now no point in asking the Commission to inquire further into the economicrelationship between Scotland and England.6. As regards the questions to be included, I think we must ask the Corn-mission to consider the adequacy of the present machinery for exercising theGovernments functions in relation to Scotland; and I propose that the commission should be asked to review this against the general financial, economic and admin-istrative background of the present day and in the light of such other considerationsas may be put before it. The Commission will thus be able to consider whetheror not any further administrative decentralisation is desirable and practicable, andin doing so to take full account of the considerations which have led to the demandfor a Parliament as well as of those which point in the opposite direction. This isnecessary if the purpose of having a Commission is to be achieved. I would expectindustrial and commercial interests, local authorities and trade unions, when givingevidence before the Commission, to come out strongly against any separatist ideas and against any proposal for change which would not lead to greater efficiency inthe conduct of public business.7. It may be arguable as to whether to go further and ask the Commissionto deal with the structure of the nationalised industries. On the one hand, thereis no doubt that recent Scottish complaints of undue centralisation and Londoncontrol are largely due to the organisation of the nationalised industries; and it maybe argued that the Commission will be an ineffective answer to the critics if its termsof reference exclude one of the main subjects of criticism. On the other hand,it is difficult to see how the Commission could usefully examine the structure ofthe nationalised industries in Scotland at a,time when surface transport and civilaviation policy is being modified, when steel is being restored to private enterprise and when legislation about Scottish electricity supply is in view. There is thefurther point that if the terms of reference cover the nationalised industries we maybe pressed to extend them further to include private industry. I shall be glad tohave the guidance of my colleagues on this question. On the whole.; I am infavour of limiting the Commission to consideration of the machinery of govern-ment and the terms of reference suggested in paragraph 1 have been framedaccordingly.(b) Timing of Announcement8.. I think that we should announce our decision to set up a Royal Commissionlike our decision to prepare the return of revenue and expenditure, immediately,onthe publication of the Catto Report. Delay in making an announcement, accOm-panied, as it would be, by renewed speculation and discussion of our intentions,could only be harmful. Indeed, we have been able to justify our refusal to appoint the.Commission so far only on the ground that we could not, settle its terms ofreference until We knew what the conclusions of the Catto Committee were. .(c) Membership of the Committee.9. Tt is, of course, essential to have a Chairman of standing and of knownimpartiality. I suggest that Sir George Cunningham should be invited to serve.Hehas had. wide administrative experience in India, is known to have good judg-ment and, to the best of my knowledge, is in no way committed on the issues which
the Commission will have to consider. As regards the other members, we shall/ Slave to find a strong body of both Scots and English who. are demonstrablyV.-^impartial, who will command confidence in Scotland and who, though not them-selves Members of-either House, will be acceptable - to the main political parties,A fair proportion of them should,. I think, have had practical experience of large-scale organisation in business or central or local government; and one of them at least must come from the Highland area.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,24th June, 1952.appendix summary of Main Conclusions of the Report of the Catto CommitteeGovernment Revenue and Expenditure . .(Part (i) of terms of reference.) :It would be practicable to make a return of the revenue from and government expenditure in (a) Scotland and (b) the rest of the United Kingdom and of the balances of revenue available for general expenditure from Scotland and the restof the United Kingdom respectively. In such a return, expenditure incurred forthe special benefit of Scotland, as distinct from other parts of the United Kingdom,would be set against the revenue contributed by residents of Scotland.(Paragraph 210.)The work involved in preparing the return would be considerable but wouldbe spread over a large number of departments. (Paragraph 211.)In the return roughly one-third of the ordinary revenue could be attributeddirectly; the attribution of the remainder, with the exception of certain indirecttaxes which account for 10 per cent, of total receipts, could be carried out by methods sufficiently sound to preclude any considerable errors.     (Paragraph 212.)About four-fifths of the ordinary expenditure could be allocated betweenEnglish, Scottish and General services on the basis of costs separately incurredfor these services. (Paragraph 213.)The return, although making no pretence to complete accuracy, would givea sufficiently reliable picture of the facts with which part (i) of our terms of refer-ence is concerned. (Paragraph 214.)The return would be of value in comparing the respective fiscal positions ofScotland and England. (Paragraph 218.)Scotland&apos;s Share in United Kingdom External Trade(Part (ii) of terms of reference.)We have found no practicable method of making a complete return ofScotland&apos;s share in the imports and exports, visible and invisible, of the UnitedKingdom. &apos; (Paragraph 263)As regards Scotland^ share of the visible trade of the United Kingdom, a record of the foreign trade handled at the Scottish sea and air ports could beprepared. We have, however, found no satisfactory, method of adjusting thisrecord to take account of the cross-Border traffic in imported goods and in goodsintended for export. : - .       (Paragraph 260.)The results of the Census of Production and Census of Distribution could notbe used to calculate Scotland^. share of visible imports, arid an estimate of hershare of visible exports based on the census figures would be obtainable only atan interval of years and would be subject to a very large margin of error., ..; &quot; (Paragraph 261.)
In the field of invisible trade there are certain transactions the division ofwhich between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom would be meaningless.The analysis of other transactions would not be so intractable, but the closeintegration of the United Kingdom economy would render the separation of theScottish share in these transactions impracticable save by the use of arbitrary andburdensome methods of division. (Paragraph: 262,)Scotland&apos;s Balance of Payments(Part (iii)  of terms of reference.)We have found no way of preparing a return of Scotland&apos;s imports from,exports to and balance of payments with other countries, including the rest of theUnited Kingdom. (Paragraph 311.)A record of Scotland&apos;s direct foreign trade by sea and air could be preparedbut we have not found any means which we can recommend of measuring thevisible trade between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.(Paragraph 309.)The measurement of the various invisible items in Scotland&apos;s balance of pay-ments would be even more difficult because of the difficulties of concept as wellas the practical obstacles which are encountered. (Paragraph 310.)In theory it would be possible to estimate the net surplus or deficit in theScottish balance of payments by measuring the net domestic capital formationin Scotland and comparing this with the amount of saving by Scotland. but because of: serious imperfections in the basic statistics such an estimate would besubject to a very wide margin of error. This method of estimation does not appearto be of immediate practical value. (Paragraph 316.)
