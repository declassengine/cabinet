Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952CONFIDENTIALCABINET office record copy copy No.? 2C. (52) 24721st July, 1952CABINETDELIMITATION OF TERRITORIAL WATERS: APPLICATION BY HERMAJESTYS GOVERNMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN BYTHE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Hague Court Judgment. On 18th December, 1951, the international court of Justice at The Hague delivered a judgment in the Anglo-NorwegianFisheries case in favour of Norway. This judgment was concerned with the mannerin which territorial waters could be delimited (though not with their actualbreadth), and, in delivering it, the Court laid down certain general principles ofinternational law governing the matter.2. These new principles differ radically from those which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have hitherto conceived to be the law. They entitle a country toreckon its territorial waters from a &quot; base-line &quot; joining outer headlands, islands and rocks, provided that the resulting line is &quot; reasonable &quot; and follows the general direction of the coast. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have in the past held that thebelt of territorial waters should be measured from the low-water mark along thecoast and across the entrances to bays at a point where they are not more than10 miles wide.3. Implications for the United Kingdom. The question arises whether her majesty&apos;s Government should in future claim round the United Kingdom andround the Colonies, Protectorates and other territories overseas for which her majesty&apos;s Government are responsible, territorial waters measured according to themore liberal principles enunciated by The Hague Court. The effect would be toincrease considerably the area of waters over which Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould claim jurisdiction, including exclusive fishery rights. This question has beenconsidered by the Home Affairs Committee, who have, however, decided that, inview of the importance of the issues at stake, it should be submitted to the Cabinet.4. Divergent Views of Government Departments. In spite of prolongeddiscussion at the official and Ministerial level, it has not been possible to reach an agreed recommendation. Considerable pressure is being brought to bear byfisheries interests in Scotland to have The Hague Court principles applied round the Scottish coast in order to close larger areas to foreign trawlers. The scottish home Department are wholly in favour of extending our territorial limits in thisway as early as possible in the interests of the Scottish inshore fishing industry.The White Fish Authority, whose responsibilities cover all sections of the Britishwhite fish industry, have recommended to the Government that action on theselines should be taken.5. On the other hand, the immediate adoption Of The Hague Court principlesis opposed by the Admiralty and the Ministry of Transport on the ground that it isnot yet clear that they are going to be generally adopted by other countriesincluding particularly the United States, or that they will be approved by theInternational Law Commission of the United Nations. They believe that as a naval and maritime Power we should hold to our established policy of maintaining42605
a maximum area of the seas free from national jurisdiction and should do nothing!which would encourage other countries to apply The Hague Court principles in a manner detrimental to our interests.6. The International Position. The fact is, however, that some othercountries, including Norway, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Yugoslavia, egypt and France (the last-named to a limited extent), had already adopted the newprinciples to a greater or lesser extent even before the announcement of The Hague court&apos;s judgment. Iceland, which had adopted them on her northern coast beforethe announcement, has subsequently applied them to the remainder of her coastline. There is considerable pressure from fishing interests in Greenland and the faroes for the adoption of the principles by the Danish Government. All this is part of a general tendency in favour of the extension of territorial limits which has only been strengthened by^The Hague Court&apos;s judgment. Even in the Common-wealth there is no chance of solid opposition to the new principles. The positionnow is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot seriously challenge base-linesadopted by other countries as long as they apply The Hague Court principlesin a reasonable fashion. The interests of Her Majesty&apos;s Government would there-fore appear to be best served by exercising a moderating influence without, atthe same time, adopting an attitude so hostile to the new principles that it wouldhave little or no support outside the United Kingdom. Moreover by acceptingbase-lines we are more likely to obtain support from other countries for our efforts to maintain the principle that the actual belt of territorial waters should be limitedto 3 miles (except where there is a valid prescriptive claim to a wider limit); a principle to which all Departments attach importance.7. The International Law Commission, which is a body of jurists establishedby the United Nations to make recommendations to the General Assembly forthe codification of international law, is intending to study the questions of the delimitation and breadth of territorial waters, and will probably be issuing a reportin 1953. The rapporteur of the Commission has recently produced a first reportto provide the basis of the Commission^ discussion. In this he recommends thegeneral acceptance of The Hague Court base-line principles for indented coasts,though with some safeguards (such as the limitation of the length of base-lines to 10 miles in some cases). Although it is impossible to prophesy what theCommission itself will recommend, it seems most improbable that there will beany general return to the stricter methods of delimitation still applied by theUnited Kingdom or that any great degree of international support for such an attitude could be obtained.8. In the circumstances there would appear to be no advantage to be gained from postponing a decision to apply The Hague Court principles to the UnitedKingdom.9. Action Required to Apply The Hague Court Principles. If it is decidedto adopt The Hague Court principles, it will be necessary id) to introduce legislation providing if or the definition of the new limits of the territorial waters of the United Kingdom, Colonies, Protectorates,&amp;c;(b) to consider whether certain international treaties, namely the Anglo-FrenchFishery Convention of 1839 and the North Sea Fisheries convention of 1882, which lay down limits based on the previous conception of thelaw, should be abrogated or amended by agreement. This action willbe necessary to secure the full benefits of the new principles for ourinshore fishermen.10. Recommendation. For the reasons given above, my recommendation isthat a decision in principle should now be taken to accept the use of the base-linemethod for the delimitation of territorial waters round the United Kingdom andthat the interdepartmental official committee on territorial waters should be instructed to prepare specific recommendations on the following points.:  (d) the timing of any public statement on the subject and the date when thedecision should be put into effect, bearing in mind the desirability ofprior consultation with the Commonwealth and with the United Statesand other Governments;(b) the detailed definition of the exact waters to be claimed around the UnitedKingdom on the basis of a reasonable and moderate application of theprinciples laid down by The Hague Court;
(c) the action to be taken in regard to the Anglo-French Fishery convention of 1839 and the North Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882;(d) the action to be taken in respect of territorial waters round the Colonies,Protectorates and other territories overseas for which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are responsible;(e) the desirability of holding a conference of fishing Powers to discussexclusive fishery limits (a suggestion which has been made in the Houseof Commons and in the Press);(/) any other points which require consideration before steps can be takento introduce the necessary legislation in the House of Commons.A.
