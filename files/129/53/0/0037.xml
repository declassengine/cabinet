BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1952Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in my memorandum on the dollar gap in the second half of 1952(C. (52) 195 of 16th June, 1952) I warned my colleagues that if there were nochange in existing policies in the import programmes put forward by Departments,we should be faced in the next six months with a loss of gold and dollar reserves which I estimated at about  175 millions.2. I have since been discussing with my colleagues principally concernedways and means of filling this gap. As a result, the following reductions in import programmes and immediate increases in exports have been agreed:- m.Increased exports of Defence Equipment 1.0&quot; &quot;      &quot;   Coal 12Savings on oil imports 19&quot;      &quot;  imports of raw materials 41&quot;     &quot;  Imports of food 10&quot;     &quot;        &quot;      &quot;  machinery 5Total 97wSECRETC.(52) 2373. It will be seen that this falls short of the amount required to fill the gap and that further action is needed.4. I suggest that in the first place we should consider whether we cannotreduce further the programme of food imports.   I believe that without great risk ordifficulty we could make savings of about  9. 2 millions on wheat and flour and about  7. 5 millions on coarse grains.(a) Wheat and Flour. A saving of  9. 2 millions on the programme could beachieved in 1952 by reducing purchases so that the level of stocks atthe end of the year fell to only 13 weeks&apos; cover.   This would imply that stocks at the end of 1953 would be equivalent to only 10 weeks1 cover.Stocks at this level would be quite adequate commercially though theywould not provide any stockpile.(b) Coarse Grains.    The import programme provides for a stock of 650,000tons at the end of this year.   This would be 250,000 tons above  thelevel reached at the end of 1951.   The programme assumes the maintenanceof a ration pool totalling 5^ million tons of all types of feeding supplies,but at present the ration is not being fully taken up and consumption islikely to prove 300,000 tons per annum less than was hitherto expected.CABINET office record copy copy NO.\0Wl&apos;*th JULY, 1952 *CABINET
The import saving from this reduced consumption during the currenthalf year would be some 100,000 tons.   Furthermore, as consumption islikely to continue into 1953 at present levels we can do with lowerstocks at the end of 1952.   The grain prospects look much better now than a few months ago.   The Russians have already indicated thatthey would like to start negotiations for another contract and the firsthome harvest reports are very promising.   I see little risk in reducing stocks by 150,000 tons as was suggested by the Minister ofFood which, together with the reduced consumption of 100,000 tons,would give a saving of S.l\ millions.   I suggest below that even more could be saved from this source.5. This extra  16, 7 millions from wheat and coarse grains will bring thetotal to about  114 millions leaving a gap of  61 millions.   I do not believe that weshould risk a loss of this order in the remainder of this year and I feel sure that more can be done.   In the discussions we have held I suggested that further savings of about  15 millions can be obtained by still further reductions in the food import programmes.   For example if we agree to keep stocks of coarse grains to the levelthat they were at the end of 1951 we could make an additional saving of  3 millions.I am discussing with the Minister of Food ways and means of saving a further 12 millions and we shall report the result to the Cabinet when this paper is discussed.6. I therefore propose -(a) that the savings of  97 millions should be put into effect immediately by departments;(b) that we should obtain additional savings of about  17 millions through aredueiionof stocks of wheat and coarse grains;(c) that in addition the Ministry of Food should produce savings of  3 millions from coarse grains;(d) that my colleagues should give further consideration to the means by whichthe remaining gap of  58 millions may be closed.7. In considering the action to be taken my colleagues should bear in mind that it is still our objective to achieve a balance in our payment with the non-sterling world in the second half of this year and that the world will be able to judge our progress towards this objective as the figures of the gold and dollar reserves are published monthly.   in these circumstances I need not emphasise the risks we shall be running if our action is inadequate,Imports for the First Half of 19538. In paragraph 6 of C, (52) 195 (the Dollar Gap:  Second Half of 1952)I said:   &quot;We must also take action, as proposed in the official Report (i. e. theReport by the Programmes Committee attached to the paper under reference) to keepour forward commitments down, and to make our import system more responsive to the needs of our balance of payments position&quot;.   The details of the new procedurewere set out in paragraphs 27 to 30 of the Report by the Programmes Committeeattached to C. (52) 195 and paragraph 3(ii) of that Report recommended that the new procedure should be adopted and a preliminary decision should now be taken on thelevel of non-sterling imports in the first half of 1953,   The level suggested was 800 millions.9. I therefore ask my colleagues&apos; approval for the adoption of the new pro-cedure and for the figure of  800 millions for non-sterling imports for the first halfof 1953, with a view to a submission being made by Departments in due course on this basis.R.A.J3.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.,X-TH JULY, .1952,
