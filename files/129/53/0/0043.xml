^Hl I  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1952^| SECRET CopyNo.28(52) 243 IJuly, 1952 -hCABINETCHINESE  AIRCRAFT  DETAINED  IN  HONG  KONG ^fl^^B Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesSeventy-one aircraft and spare parts, of which the Americans and the ChineseBBB] Communists both claim ownership, are at present detained in Hong Kong under B^Ha special Order in Council made on 10th May, 1950, which provides that theirBBB] ownership should be decided by a court of law before they are permitted to leavethe Colony.2. The case relating to thirty-one of these aircraft, formerly belonging tothe China National Aviation Corporation, is still in its early stages. The caserelating to forty aircraft formerly belonging to the Central Air Transport^^B Corporation, a Chinese concern, is now at the final stage.  The Americans have A^H^^B appealed to the Privy Council against the ruling of the Hong Kong courts that^^B these aircraft belong to the Chinese. The appeal is due to be heard by the Judicial ft^H^^B Committee of the Privy Council on 21st July and a decision is expected to be^^B announced before the end of the present law term.3. When the Order in Council was issued in May 1950, it was the intentionH      that the aircraft should be handed over to whichever party were found to be the A^H^^B legal owners. In view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s obligation under the UnitedB^H Nations Resolution of May 1951, recommending an embargo on the shipment of A^H^^B strategic materials to China, the Foreign Secretary and I have decided after^^B consultation with the Governor of Hong Kong that, if the appeal is dismissed ft^H^^B and the forty C.A.T.C. aircraft are thus finally established as belonging to theChinese, they should continue for the time being to be detained in Hong Kong.The necessary legal and administrative steps are being taken by the Hong Kong ft^HGovernment. If the Privy Council decide that the aircraft are Chinese property,? I      there will be an immediate outcry in America unless we announce without delaythat, notwithstanding the Privy Council&apos;s decision, the aircraft will not at present ft^HB^H be handed over to the Chinese.  A public statement to this effect will be made inLondon and Washington and probably also in Hong Kong as soon as the decisionB^^fl4. If the appeal is allowed and the aircraft are awarded to the Americans,they will be asked to remove them from Hong Kong as soon as practicable, butthey will not be allowed to export them direct to Formosa from Hong Kong.H Once the decision of the Privy Council, if favourable to the Americans, is known^^fl there will be grave danger of the aircraft being sabotaged by the Chinese Communistemployees, numbering about 500, who are at present responsible for their main-tenance. Steps have therefore been taken to intensify police protection in HongKong and preparations are being made to remove the Communist employees, ifneed arises, as soon as judgment is given. The Governor expects that force mayhave to be used to evict and exclude these persons from Kai Tak aerodrome, towhich they have been permitted access for the last two years while litigation hasbeen in progress. It has been agreed, however, that no action should be taken toevict them until after the Privy Council&apos;s decision, since the Governor feels thatif such action were taken the employees would resist and there might be wide-spread disturbances throughout the Colony.  If the action taken is clearly seen1] to arise from the judgment of the Privy Council, these disturbances are, in theGovernor&apos;s view, less likely to occur.Colonial Office, S.W.I,I 42573
