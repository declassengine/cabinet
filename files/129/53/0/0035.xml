Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1952CONFIDENTIALCABINET OFFIGfcRECORD copy copy No. 6 2C. (52) 23510th July, 1952CABINETCORONATION:  PART TO BE PLAYED BY india memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the question arises of the part to be played by India in the Coronation ceremony.2. As a result of informal enquiry it has been ascertained that the PrimeMinister of India would be willing to accept an invitation from The Queen toattend the Coronation Service. The question now to be considered is whetherIndia should be given the opportunity of participating in the attendant ceremonial,e.g., by taking part in processions, sending a contingent from the Armed Forces, &amp;c,on the same footing as the other Members of the Commonwealth.3. Logically, it can be argued that there is no ground for such participation.India does not accept the Sovereignty of The Queen or admit allegiance toHer Majesty, but only recognises The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth.It can be argued with much justification that it is anomalous that a country in this position should, on an occasion of this kind, be treated in the same way as thosewho fully accept the Sovereignty and admit the allegiance. It is indeed possiblethat some Members of the Commonwealth, and especially Pakistan, would resentstrongly India being placed on the same footing as themselves. It is, moreover,not clear at present whether the Government of India themselves would wish toparticipate in exactly the same way as the other Members of the Commonwealth,having regard to the special constitutional position of India as a Republic.4. On the other hand, if it were the desire of India to participate on thesame footing as the other Members, it would be politically most undesirable notto give her the opportunity of doing so. Not only would this have a most fortunate effect on relations with India, but the absence of India might well berepresented by unfriendly foreign countries as evidence of internal dissensionwithin the Commonwealth and a sign of its impending dissolution.5. On balance, therefore, I feel that it would be desirable to ascertaininformally from the Prime Minister of India whether he would desire that india should participate in the same way as the other Members of the Commonwealth.I should propose that the enquiry should be so framed as to elicit a reply thatMr. Nehru would be content if he himself were present at the Coronation Serviceand any attendant ceremonies, or at any rate would not wish that India should participate to the same extent as those Members of the Commonwealth whichowe allegiance to The Queen. For example, he might not send any Indiancontingent to take part in the Coronation Procession or, if he sent one, he mightbe satisfied that it should participate on a somewhat different footing from thoseof other Commonwealth countries.6. If this were Mr. Nehru&apos;s reply, it would not be necessary (as it might balfour India were participating on precisely the same scale as other Members of theCommonwealth) to arrange that representatives of India should take part in the preparations for the Coronation in the same way as representatives of the other commonwealth Governments, i.e., that the High Commissioner for India in london should be a member of the Coronation Joint Committee or that India should begiven the opportunity of nominating representatives to the Coronation Commissionitself. Details of the various arrangements affecting India could be settled byseparate discussion with the High Commissioner.7. Presumably the next step will be to ascertain the views of The Queenon this question. It would then be possible to make enquiries through the acting United Kingdom High Commissioner in India on the lines indicated inparagraph 5 above.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,10th July, 1952.42540
