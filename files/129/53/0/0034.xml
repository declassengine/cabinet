They will, however, make it possible not to increaseexpenditure over the next few years to the full extent previously planned,and will somewhat lighten the burden on the metal-using industries.(d) Production capacity which, as a result of these cham 0-s may becomesurplus to the needs of our forces, will as far as possible be retainedand employed for the manufacture of equipment required by theCommonwealth and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).These exports will help us maintain a high war potential and will atthe same time contribute to the solution of our balance of payments problem.(e) We are, of course, consulting with the Commonwealth and N.A.T.O. on matters affecting our joint responsibilities.3.    I attach a draft statement indicating the form which, I suggest, theannouncement might take.D.S.Ministry of Supply, S.W.1.10th July, 1952.
SUGGESTED FORM OF STATEMENT announcing the CHANGES IN THE DEFENCE PROGRAMME.1.    For some months the Government have, together with the Chiefs of Staff,been reviewing the country&apos;s defence policy in the light of the present international situation, and of the technical advances of recent years.2.    The three-year re-armament programme, which was initiated after theoutbreak of hostilities in Korea, was designed to secure a rapid build-up of our defensive strength.   By and large this programme, both in regard to productionand military training, is making excellent progress and is steadily increasing our ability to defend these islands and to fulfil our overseas obligations tothe Commonwealth and N.A.T.O.3.    However, our problem is not confined to the rebuilding of our armed strengthover a three or four year period.   We have to consider also the economic andmilitary implications of maintaining it for an indefinite time to meet a standing threat of unknown duration,4,    In considering this problem we have had to take into account the importantchanges which have been taking place in the military situation.   These include the rapid expansion of atomic power in the United States and the development of the atomic weapon by Russia;  the advent of jet aircraft capable of flying at very high altitudes and at speeds close to, or beyond, that of sound;  the great increasein the range of submarines;  the introduction of new types of mines;  and theprogress made in the development of guided missiles.5.    These and other technical advances call for revisions in our overall strategicconception, which will entail alterations in the disposition of our military manpower and some change of emphasis as between the various sectors of our rearmamenteffprt.   In consequence, certain parts of the defence programme, to which greater importance is now attached, will need to bos expanded or accelerated, whilst other elements which have become less essential or urgent can be curtailed or spreadover a longer period.6.    It does not, however, follow that in cases where economies in service requirements are found possible,production will necessarily be cut back.   In aprotracted period of armed peace, such as the present, one of the most important factors in our defence is the creation of an adequate war potential.    We shall,therefore, wherever possible, use any production capacity which may becomesurplus to the needs of our own forces, for the manufacture of equipment required by the rest of the Commonwealth, N.A.T.O. and other friendly countries.7,    In this way we hope to be able, without extra cost, to maintain and in somecases even expand our war potential, whilst at the same time making an additional contribution to the strength of the free world.   To the extent that they exportequipment to countries outside the sterling area or to sterling countries whowould otherwise have to import from outside the area, the industries engaged in defence production will, like other exporting industries, be helping to redressour balance of payments.8,    It is clear that in our present economic situation, this country, which for its size is making a greater defensive effort than any other country in the world,cannot accept any addition to the burden which it is already bearing.   The
manges contemplated will not, on balance, result in any decrease in the presentte of defence expenditure.   They will, however, make it possible not toincrease expenditure over the next few years to the full extent previouslyplanned, and will, in consequence, somewhat lighten the demands made uponthe metal-using industries which are the mainstay of our export trade,V .   Britain&apos;s military plans are closely bound up with those of the commonwealth and N.A.T.O. and we are, of course, consulting with them on matters affecting our joint responsibilities.
