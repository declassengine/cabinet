Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom will wish to inform the Secretary-General, as they attach importance to associating the United Nations with the warningstatement in this way.The arrangements for signature of the warning statementremain as set out in my memorandum of 27th February.A.E.Foreign Office, S.
