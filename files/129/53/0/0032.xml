Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952SECRETCAbiNET Oi-FICLRECORD copy copy No. 7 8C. (52) 2328th July 1952CABINETHANDLING OF COLONIAL QUESTIONS AT THE UNITED NATIONS:THE QUESTION OF WITHDRAWAL IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the last Session of the Assembly some of the anti-colonial Powers tried to establish the right of the United Nations to discuss the political affairs of colonies,and to assert, at least by implication, that Administering Powers are accountable tothe United Nations for the administration of their colonies. If such a principle were established our position as an Administering Power would be seriously impaired.2. Our best hope of diverting the General Assembly from such courses isto increase our general influence and that of other moderate members. Our policyis to keep down the temperature in debates, to make reasonable and constructivecontributions and to present our policies in a clear and positive manner. Approachesthrough diplomatic channels have also a useful influence on certain countries.3. These methods, however, take time to bear fruit. Other methods mustbe considered of dealing with attempts which may well be made at the forthcomingSeventh Session of the General Assembly to establish principles which would impair our ability to maintain our position in the colonies. (There is attached at annex A a note of the main principles which we cannot afford to see established.)4, We must therefore be prepared to consider the possibility of threateningto withdraw and, if necessary, actually withdrawing from any proceedings in theAssembly arising out of a decision to discuss matters of the &quot;kind referred to inparagraph 1 above, particularly in cases where no other redress is open to us (e.g.,(a) and (b) (ii) and (iii) of Annex A).5.   In favour of this course it may be said:  (i) The French and Belgian Governments, which are our closest allies inthese matters, are strongly in favour of it.(ii) A threat of withdrawal proved effective during the Sixth Session of theGeneral Assembly in helping to avert the passage of a resolution affirm-ing the right of the Fourth Committee (which deals with matters relating to trust and non-self-governing territories) to discuss the politicalaffairs of non-self-governing territories.(iii) It might make States which proposed to discuss matters of the kindreferred to in paragraph 1 hesitate if they knew that in those circum-stances we (and those who think like us) should withdraw.6.   On the other hand: -(a) It is arguable that withdrawal is not by itself a sanction at all.  however much we dislike the proceedings, our withdrawal might well fail to. arrest them. It might, for example, be decided to hear oral petitioners,e.g., from Cyprus, even in our absence. During the last&apos; session of theAssembly both the South African and French Delegations (for differentreasons) staged withdrawals which were ineffective. Yet once they foundwe were prepared to do the same they (or the Belgians) might well pressus to join in some similar demonstrations for their benefit which wewould find awkward to refuse.42530
Foreign Office, S.W. 1,8th July, 1952.ANNEX ABASIC ISSUES(a) The right of the United Nations to discuss the political affairs of non-self-governing territories.(b) The principle of accountability to the United Nations, as exemplified in thefollowing forms: -(i) the right of the United Nations to make, or attempt to make, recommenrdations on any subject relating to particular non-self-governingterritories;(ii) the right of petition in relation to non-self-governing territories;(iii) the granting of oral hearings to persons with complaints regarding non-self-governing territories (as distinct from trust territories);(iv) the sending of Visiting Missions to non-self-governing territories;(v) the holding of plebiscites in non-self-governing or trust territories except with the consent of the Administering Authority.(b) It is from a threat to withdraw rather than from actual withdrawal that wdshould hope to derive benefit. But it seems unwise to base our policy on a bluff which may be called.(c) The whole policy of withdrawal is not only publicly identified with the actions, of the Soviet Government, but is objectionable as conflictingwith the view of the United Nations as a forum in which differences mayand should be discussed.7. RecommendationsAlthough the manoeuvre of withdrawal is distasteful and its effectiveness cannotbe gauged with certainty, we must be prepared to consider the possibility ofthreatening or using it, as an extreme course, if an attempt is made to discuss matters vitally touching our colonial position. I therefore recommend that the leader of the United Kingdom Delegation to the Assembly, should have priorauthority to threaten to withdraw our representative from any such discussion.This authority should, however, be given on condition that the threat would not becarried out without prior reference to London, except in extremis.A.
