Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 2223rd July, 1952CABINETFOOD prices memorandum by the Minister of FoodMy colleagues may be interested to know of two impending changes in theprices of foods which are subject to control.In the Appendices attached to this Memorandum particulars are given of:  (i) Minor increases in the prices of sweet biscuits required to cover increases in the cost of packeting and distribution.(ii) Increases in the price of main crop potatoes required to cover the higher prices awarded to growers at recent Agricultural Price Reviews, minorincreases in wholesalers&apos; margins to meet higher transport costs, and increases in some retail margins to meet increased costs.G. LL.-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1952.APPENDIX IIncreases in the Prices of Sweet Biscuits1. Biscuits in half-lb. packets. Recent costings have shown that the presentadditional charge of 2d. per lb. permitted to manufacturers in respect of biscuitspacked in half-pound packets is inadequate, owing to increases in the costs ofpackaging materials and wages. The maximum retail prices for these packets aretherefore being increased by Id. per lb. at the earliest opportunity. Only about^ per cent, of sweet biscuits are sold in packeted form. The All Items Cost-of-Living Index is unaffected.2. Admission in biscuit costings of increased allowances to Wholesalers. Since 1943 the prices of individual lines of sweet biscuits have contained, where appropriate, an allowance for wholesaling of 95. Ad. per cwt. (Id. per lb.). this figure is unrealistic to-day in view of the increases in wholesalers&apos; costs. I have accordingly decided to increase the allowance from 9s. Ad. to 14s. per cwt. (\%d.per lb.). This increase will only affect the 12^ per cent, of output sold throughwholesalers, but the lines of sweet biscuits likely to be increased by the minimumstep of Id. per lb. represent less than 5 per cent, of total production. The effect onthe All Items Cost-of-Living Index is negligible.3. The prices of unsweetened biscuits, which were freed from control lastFebruary, are not affected by either of these increases.Copy No.42511
APPENDIX IIIncreases in Ware Potato prices. Ware (eating) potatoes are price-controlled for the duration of each main-crop season, which for this purpose runs from 1st August to the following Juneor July when the old crop is used up.2. Growers&apos; fixed prices for 1952 crop Ware potatoes are 10s. 6d. per tonhigher than those prescribed last season. This increase is made up of 35. 6d. per tonawarded at the February 1951 Price Review and Is. per ton awarded at the special review following the increase in Agricultural Wages in November 1951. Theeffect of this on retail prices is on average about one halfpenny per 7 lbs.3. Wholesale margins are in the main the same as those of last season. small increases are necessary to take account of the increases in rail and road transport costs. The effect on retail prices is negligible.4. It is necessary to give a small increase in the retail margins on sales in-lb. lots. These margins have remained virtually unchanged since the war. Costshave increased substantially, wages alone having risen by over 30 per cent, in thelast five years, while the price of potatoes has doubled in the same period, owingto the removal of the tonnage subsidy in 1947 and the acreage payment in 1951.The retail margin on sales in 7-lb. lots will therefore be increased from 25. 6d.to 35. per cwt.5. The combined result of these changes will be to increase the average retail price of potatoes by about one penny per 7 lb. The effect on the All Items Cost-of-Living Index is likely to be about -11.
