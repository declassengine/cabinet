Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1952SECRETCopy No. * iC. (52) 2318th July, 1952CABINET office record COPYCABINETCOMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF OFFICE BY PART-TIME CLERKSTO  JUSTICESJoint Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Home SecretarySection 42 of the Justices of the Peace Act, 1949, requires the Secretary of state to make regulations providing for the compensation of persons who suffer loss of office or diminution of emoluments as a result of the Act. The question on whichthe decision of the Cabinet is sought is whether these regulations should providefor compensation for part-time clerks to justices.2. There are at present about 700 clerks to justices in England and Wales,of whom about 600 are part-time. Under the Justices of the Peace Act, 1949,magistrates&apos; courts committees have now been set up, broadly speaking, in each county and county borough, and they are reviewing in advance the action whichwill need to be taken with regard to the staffing of the magistrates&apos; courts on1st April, 1953, when the Act comes fully into force. One of the main purposesof the Act, following the recommendation of the Departmental Committee onJustices&apos; Clerks which was presided over by Lord Roche, is that there shouldbe an increase in the number of whole-time clerks; this would be achieved by the magistrates&apos; courts committees appointing one person to serve as a whole-timeclerk for two or more petty sessional divisions, or amalgamating two or more pettysessional divisions into a single division with one full-time clerk. The magistrates&apos;courts committees will not, however, be able to come to any conclusions until they know whether compensation is to be provided for part-time clerks who are displacedas a result of such reorganisation.3. The question was raised whether section 42 of the Justices of the Peace Act,1949, is mandatory on the Secretary of State, and leaves him with no alternative but to make regulations providing for compensation for all displaced officers,including part-time officers. The Attorney-General and Solicitor-General have advised that, although under the section the Secretary of State may provide for compensation for part-time officers, he is not compelled to do so. The LordChancellor is by no means confident that this view would prevail if put to the testin legal proceedings, but nevertheless thinks that from the point of view of policyit is desirable to act on the view of the law taken by the Attorney-General andSolicitor-General, since otherwise it would become arguable that new regulations to a like effect would then have to be made under other post-war Acts which containsomewhat similar provisions.4. The Minister of Health and the Minister of Local Government and Planninghave drawn attention to twelve other post-war Acts which give power to make regulations providing for compensation for loss of office. Seven of these Actshave provisions specifically excluding the payment of compensation to part-timeofficers; five have provisions not dissimilar from those in the Justices of the PeaceAct, 1949, but the regulations made under these Acts have limited compensation to full-time officers.   The Ministers concerned suggest that, if compensation is42529\

We think, however, that there are strong reasons for treating part-timeclerks to justices as a special case and that the provision of compensation for themneed not have repercussions elsewhere, for the following reasons:  (a) There can be no doubt that, if there is no compensation for part-timeclerks, magistrates&apos; courts committees will not terminate the servicesof such clerks on any large scale, and one of the primary purposes of theAct of 1949 will be defeated. We think that this Act can be distinguished from all the other Acts (some of which have not resulted in any part-time officers at all losing their office) by the fact that the displacementof part-time officers is not an incidental by-product of a rearrangement of functions but is of itself one of the primary aims of the Act. It wouldnot be practicable for the magistrates&apos; courts committees to securewhole-time appointments by waiting for a vacancy to arise on the retirement of a part-time clerk, since it would not often be possibleto find another part-time clerk in a neighbouring division willing togive up his private practice and become a whole-time clerk; and itwould not be possible to appoint a whole-time clerk from elsewherebecause the part-time clerks in other neighbouring divisions which might otherwise be combined would still be in office. The opportunity whichwill occur in April next of making fundamental rearrangements will therefore not recur.(b) The Government is likely to be charged with breach of faith if no com-pensation is given to part-time justices&apos; clerks. Lord Roche and otherMembers of the House of Lords have said that they thought, when the justices of the Peace Bill was being passed, that compensation wouldbe provided for part-time clerks and that they would not have supported the Bill if this was not to be so. The Conservative Party supported theBill in the belief that compensation would be provided for part-timeclerks and a decision now against granting such compensation wouldbe contrasted with the views which they held in opposition.(c) Part-time justices&apos; clerks differ from other part-time officers in that by thenature of their office they are debarred from a substantial field of private practice. A clerk is unable to handle as a private solicitor any caselikely to come before his own bench, and it is also common for hispartners not to take on work which might come before that court.6. Any compensation would be payable from local funds, and would not belikely to exceed  150,000. For the reasons explained above we do not think thatit is likely to lead to fresh expense elsewhere.7. The coming into force of the remaining provisions of the Justices of thePeace Act in April next provides ah opportunity for making a substantial improve-ment in the administration of justice in summary courts, which is of the first importance at a time when crime is so prevalent. If there is no provision for thecompensation of part-time clerks to justices, the implementation of the Act willbe considerably handicapped. We therefore ask for authority for the regulations under the Act of 1949 to include compensation for displaced part-time clerks tojustices. The terms of the regulations would be settled in consultation with theMinisters concerned with the various Acts containing similar provisions.SIMONDS.D. M. F.
