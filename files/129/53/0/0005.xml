DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY ^-GOVERNMENT)^C ON FIDE NT IA LoC.(52) 205. COPY NO.^19th JUNE, 1952.CABINETTRANSPORT bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.I am concerned about the position of Scotland under the transport bill and I would like the Cabinet to consider it.2. In our publication &quot;Scottish Control of Scottish Affairs&quot;, -which wasspecifically endorsed before the last election, we said:-&quot;It is essential that there should be effective control by our own people in Scotland of those parts of nationalised industries and services which operate in Scotland...   In frail transport we propose a separate Scottish board co-co-ordinated with the board in England.   The board would be responsible in Scotland to the Minister of Transport in exactly the same way as the English board would be in England. &quot;3. More recently, the Scottish Council, which is a completelyrepresentative and non-political body, has proposed the establishment of a scottish Transport Authority which would be responsible to the British transport commission for the operation in Scotland of all the Commission^ undertakings.The Commission^ railway and bus interests in Scotland must, for geographicalreasons, be closely linked with one another if travellers are to get an efficientservice and, for this reason, the proposal to bring them under co-ordinatedmanagement has been widely approved.4. I am satisfied with the provision made in clause 15 for theconstitution of a railway authority for Scotland, to which would be delegated such functions of the Commission relating to the railways as the scheme to be preparedby the Commission and approved by the Minister may specify.   I recognise thatfor practical reasons the administration of the Scottish railways cannot bedivorced from that of the railways in England and Wales;  and provision for consultation  with the Secretary of State should ensure that in dealing with theCommission^ scheme the Minister takes Scottish interests fully into account.5. But if we go no further we are bound to be criticised on the ground that effective control, not only of the railways but of the Commission^ otherScottish interests, rests with a body resident in London and influenced in its consideration of policy by its major English interests. &apos; I think we would have an effective answer to this criticism if we were to insert in the Bill - withoutaltering clause 15 - a new clause based on section 2 of the Sea Fish industry act, 1951, requiring the appointment by the Minister of a Scottish Committee,whose chairman would be a member of the Commission, and whose function wouldbe to give &quot;advice to the Commission about the exercise and performance of their functions as respects Sect!uid and matters particularly affecting Scotland
and. of exercising such of the Commission^ functions as respects Scotlandt. matters particularly affecting Scotland as may from time to time beegated to the Committee by the Commission, &quot;  I hope this suggestionmay be further considered.J.S.Scottish Office, S.W.I.19th JUNE,   1952.
