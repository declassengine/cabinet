5 document is the property of her britannic  majesty&apos;s   government &apos; /Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1952CONFIDENTIAL - Copy No. 2 &apos;7C. (52) 213Uth June, 1952CABINETNORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION: STATUS OFMILITARY HEADQUARTERSMemorandum by the Secretary cf State for Foreign AffairsThe North Atlantic Council has submitted to N.A.T.O. Governments for theiripproval or comment by 2nd July a draft Protocol to govern the status of N.A.T.O.ntcrnational military headquarters. This draft Protocol, in the preparation of*hich British officials have taken part, is the logical, extension of the Status of forces Agreement for which enabling legislation has already been approved byfly colleagues. A summary of the draft Protocol and the text ,are attached asAnnexes I and II.2. I propose to instruct the United Kingdom Permanent Representative on:he North Atlantic Council to accept the draft Protocol on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment subject to any. drafting or other minor amendments which may befound necessary.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,24th June, 1952.- ANNEX ISummarySature of the Protocol .The Protocol, a copy of which is attached as Annex II, extends to international-nilitary headquarters (such as S.H.A.P.E.) and their personnel the provisions ofthe Status of Forces Agreement signed by the North Atlantic Treaty Powers inLondon on 19th June, 1951, which regulates the status of national forces of one.A.T.Q. member in the territory of another member. It also contains in articles 8to 13 certain additional provisions which have no parallel in the Status of ForcesAgreement but which are considered desirable in regard to an internationalheadquarters. - &apos;2. The Protocol will apply automatically to Supreme Headquarters, Europe*nd Atlantic, and to other international military - headquarters immediatelymbordinate to them. Provision is made in article 14 (1) for its extension, bydecision of the North Atlantic Council, to other international military headquartersiiid international military organisations (such as the N.A.T.O. Defence College inParis) set up under the North Atlantic Treaty., Enabling legislation. The Visiting Forces Bill (for which approval was given in H.A. (51)Uth meeting, minute 7, and L.C. (52) 9th meeting, minute 1) has already been42455 b .
introduced in Parliament to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Status of forces Agreement. &apos; If the Visiting Forces Bill is duly enacted, the additionallegislation xequired to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Protocol wouldbe. in connection with the following articles:  Article 4 (a) on criminal jurisdiction;Article 10, giving each Supreme Headquarters juridical personality;Article 11 (2), which makes the property and funds of a headquarters in certain cases immune from execution or legal seizure by a court;Article 13, on the inviolability of documents belonging to a headquarters.Financial Provisions4. The three other provisions of the Protocol which merit particular attentionare Articles-7 and .8 dealing with taxation and Article 12 (2) on the transfer anJconversion of currency.5. Article 7 provides for income tax exemption for headquarters staff, whofall into three categories:         .(i) military staff who belong to the armed services of the North atlantic treaty countries and who are attached to the headquarters for duty;&apos; (ii) civilian staff-employed by such armed services who are attached to the headquarters for duty; and(iii) civilian staff-directly employed by the headquarters.The first two categories will be paid by the armed forces of which they are members or by&apos;which they are employed and therefore can be assimilated for income tax purposes to the members of the national forces and their civilian components towhom the Status of Forces Agreement itself applies. The third category can be assimilated to the international staff of N.A.T.O. and are therefore brought underthe income tax arrangements laid down in Article 19 of the Agreement on theStatus of N.A.T.O., National Representatives and International Staff, signed in ottawa on 20th September, 195.1.- The effect is that British nationals in cate-gories (i) and (ii) will be liable to United Kingdom income tax on the salaries and emoluments received by them as members of the military headquarters staff, binthose in category (iii). will not. This scheme, with which the departments con-cerned are satisfied, represents a carefully weighed compromise between nationalrequirements. Legislation covering the Status of Forces Agreement and the civilian Status Agreement will probably be included in next year&apos;s Finance bill and the necessary small addition to cover the categories in the Protocol couldbe made at the same time. . The principle that United Kingdom nationals on thestaff of international organisations should be exempt from United Kingdom inconi;tax on the salaries and emoluments paid to them as such has already been accepteJand applied by the United Kingdom to the international staff of other international organisations . (Diplomatic Privileges (General Amendment) Order in Council.1950). &apos; . &apos; ....6.&quot; Article 8, paragraph 1, provides that, each N.A.T.O. member should negotiate an agreement with any allied headquarters operating in its territory urelieve it so far as practicable from all duties and taxes which would add to thecost of common defence. This paragraph was proposed by the United States iomeet the requirements of the Mutual Security Act and the intention is thaiN.A.T.O. countries should extend to the international military headquarters towhich the Protocol applies the same taxation privileges as they have already under-taken to extend.to the United States Government in connexion with its expenditur:on mutual defence. The United States will, on its part, grant equivalent privilege!This provision of the Protocol should produce no special difficulty for us. Th:United Kingdom has already entered into a bilateral agreement with the UnitedStates of the kind.contemplated (exchange of notes of 17th and 18th March, 1952).At present in the. United Kingdom there are no N.A.T.O. military headquartento which the Protocol will apply.7. Article 12, paragraph 2, provides that countries- should facilitate thttransfer: to another country and the conversion into another currency of fundiheld by a headquarters.. This will not formally oblige the United Kingdom lo1 convert Sterling funds, for example, into dollars where this would serious!)prejudice our interests; the undertaking is in fact similar to that already given b.-the United Kingdom in respect of other, international bodies.
8. When the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community comesnlo force it will be necessary for the Council to determine the mariner in whichhe Pn . ;ol shall apply to members of the European Defence Forces attached tonlernauonal military headquarters. It will&apos;also be necessary to draw1 up anidditional Protocol defining the status, of the European Defence Forces in thes&apos;orth Atlantic Treaty countries.ANNEX ii draft Protocol on the Status of International Military Headquarters &apos;set up Pursuant to the North Atlantic treaty the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington on 4th April, 1949,Considering that international military Headquarters may be established intheir territories, by separate arrangement, under the North Atlantic Treaty, and desiring to define the status of such Headquarters and of the personnel thereofwithin the North Atlantic Treaty area,Have agreed to the present Protocol to the Agreement signed in London on19th June, 1951,&apos;regarding the Status of their Forces:  Article 1In the present Protocol the expression (a) &quot; the Agreement&quot; means the Agreement signed in London on 19th June,1951, by the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the status of their Forces; -&apos; ib) &quot; Supreme Headquarters &quot; means Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers inEurope and Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander atlantic and/any equivalent international military Headquarters set up&apos;pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty;  .   .(c) &quot;Allied Headquarters &quot;means any Supreme Headquarters and any inter-national military Headquarters set up pursuant to the North&apos;atlantic treaty which is immediately subordinate to a Supreme Headquarters;id) &quot; North Atlantic Council &quot; means the Council established by Article 9 ofthe North Atlantic Treaty or any of its subsidiary bodies authorised to. act-on its behalf.Article 2Subject to the following provisions of this Protocol, the Agreement shall applyto Allied Headquarters in the territory of a Party to the present Protocol in theNorth Atlantic Treaty area, and to the military and civilian personnel of suchHeadquarters and their dependents included in the definitions in sub-paragraphs id),lb) and (c) of paragraph 1 of&apos;Article 3 of this Protocol, when such personnel arepresent in any such territory in connection with their official duties or, in the caseof dependents, the official duties of their spouse or parent.Article 31.
