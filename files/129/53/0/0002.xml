An attempt has been made to estimate the cost of our overseas commit-commitments . Certain limited figures are available which give an indication of the orderof magnitude involved, and these are attached as an Annex. But.it is impossible(o give precise figures of the real cost of maintaining any individual commitment,or to quantify the many intangible factors in the problem.Basic Factors3. The foreign policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom is determined by certain fundamental factors:  (a) The United Kingdom has world responsibilities inherited from several hundred years as a great Power.lb) The United Kingdom is not a self-sufficient economic unit,(c) No world security system exists, and the United Kingdom with the restof the non-Communist world, is faced with an external threat.&apos;4. The essence of a sound foreign policy is to ensure that a country&apos;s strength is equal to its obligations. If this is not the case, then either the obligations mustbe reduced to the level at which resources are available to maintain them, or agreater share of the country&apos;s resources must be devoted to their support. It is becoming clear that rigorous maintenance of the presently-accepted policies ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government at home and abroad is placing a burden on the country&apos;economy which it is beyond the resources of the country to meet. A position hasalready been reached where there is no reserve and therefore no margin forunforeseen additional obligations.5. The first task must be to determine how far the external obligations of thecountry can be reduced or shared with others, or transferred to other shoulders,without impairing too seriously the world position of the United Kingdom andsacrificing the vital advantages which flow from it. But if, after careful review,it is shown that the total effort required is still beyond the capacity of existing national resources, a choice of the utmost difficulty lies before the British people,for they must either give up, for a time, some of the advantages which a high standard of living confers upon them, or, by relaxing their grip in the outside world, see their country sink to the level of a second-class Power, with injury to42433 b
their essential interests and way.of&apos;life&apos;of &quot;which they can have little conception.Faced with this choice, the British people might be rallied to a greater productiveeffort Which would enable a-greater volume&apos;of external commitments to be borne.Withdrawal from Obligations--6/ There are very strong arguments against a complete abandonment of a major commitment. First, in the present.state of world tension, unless arrangements,have been made for the burden to. be transferred to friendly shoulders, the russians would be only too ready to fill, any vacuum created by. a British withdrawal, witha&apos; Consequent shifting&apos;of the balance of power against the West. It is furtherobvious that, when an area falls into Communist hands its economic and tradingvalue to the Western world becomes greatly reduced while Western capital assetsare liquidated with little or no compensation.7.&apos; Secondly, withdrawal from a major commitment would affect the inter-national. status of the United Kingdom. By reducing the value.of the UnitedKingdom as a partner&apos; and ally, it would undermine the cohesion of the Common-wealth and the special relationship of the United Kingdom with the United Statesand its European partners and other allies. Their attitude towards us will depend largely upon our status as a world Power and upon their belief that we are ready and willing to support them. It is evident that in so far as we reduce our commit-mentsand our power declines, our claim to the leadership of the Commonwealth,to a position of influence in Europe, and to a special relationship with the UnitedStates will be, pro tanto, diminished.8. . Thirdly, the British world position brings with it concurrent and beneficialresults of an economic and financial nature. The abandonment of our position inany area of the world may well have similar concurrent and adverse effects on our economic and trading interests.9. Finally, there is the general effect of loss of prestige. It is impossible to assess in concrete terms the consequences to ourselves and the Commonwealth ofour drastically and unilaterally reducing&apos; our responsibilities; the effects of a failureof will and relaxation of grip in our overseas commitments are incalculable. Butonce the prestige of a country has started to slide there is no knowing whereit will stop.Classification of Obligations10. The same.reasoning applies to a lesser extent to a policy of reduction andsharing of, obligations. It is? therefore, essential that this policy should be contrivedin such a manner and applied in such areas as to do the least harm to the worldposition of the United Kingdom. In order to determine where, if anywhere, our responsibilities could be diminished, it is now necessary to survey our existing obligations.11. - These fall broadly into three categories (a) Obligations arising from the geographical position of the British Isles.(b) Obligations arising from our imperial heritage.(c) Obligations arising from our international position.12.-(a) Obligations arising from the geographical position of the British Isles-Defence of the United Kingdom and Western Europe.   .&apos; Preservation of sea and air communications.Membership of N.A.T.O.Maintenance of forces on the Continent.::   (b) Obligations arising from our Imperial Heritage&apos;,&apos;. ;7.

vv (c) Obligations, arising from our. International^Position.,.&quot;: Share of&apos;international action, in&quot;resisting&apos;aggression;-e:g., Korea.&quot;      - -Share of economic assistance to Other Countries^ e.gl, Yugoslavia, Korea.Obligations arising from participation in International Organisations,e.g., U.N.O., G.A.T.T., O.E.E.C., E.P,U.,,,v ^ ,y.^ H...    Other&apos; external commitments, e.g., Iraq, Jordan, Arab refugees..13-&apos; There,is the further, category/,of.&apos; purely^financial obligations&apos; which&apos; fallpartly under (Wand partly under,(c). These obligations.arise from;the,.po.siti&apos;on of the United Kingdom, as the holder,of&apos;. the central.reserves of the&apos;,Sterling1.area and the liabilities arising from&apos;&apos;lhe&apos;Sterling. balances.!1&apos;&apos;Ap^t.lfrprri a.reference tothe Sterling balances in paragraph 27 below, the problems&apos; of the..Sterling&apos;area are not discussed in this paper. But it should be emphasised that the existenceof the Sterling Area and the functions of the United Kingdom&apos; within it are important factors in the world position of the United Kingdom. If the Sterling Area wereto be weakened or broken up, this would be regarded in,.other countries as a heavy blow to the influence and prestige of the United Kingdom.; it would under-mine the cohesion of the Commonwealth; and would thus further weaken Britishauthority in world affairs.14. It is evident from this classification that theoretically, it would be opento us in some cases to cut out a commitment altogether, since we are&apos;alone in holding the commitment (e.g., the surrender of Hong Kong to the Chinese). In other cases, where we are co-operating with other countries in assuming international commitments, we could only contract out of them or reduce them by negotiation(e.g., our general contribution to the defence effort through N.A.T.O., includingour specific allocation, of 4^ British divisions and the Second Tactical Air force to Western Germany). It is also evident that some measure of relief might beobtained by reducing the scale of our contributions to International Organisations.But wherever we decide to reduce, the result would be a greater or less diminution of our influence as a world.Power. &apos; We come back therefore to the problem of finding those areas in which reduction could be effected v/ith the least harm toour position.Possible Methods of Relief15. If total withdrawal from any major obligations is ruled out, there are three ways in which we can effect reductions in our obligations: - by reducing thescale; by sharing the burden with other friendly Powers; or by transferring a minor obligation to friendly shoulders. These methods could also be used in combination.Category A Obligations(i) Defence of the United Kingdom and Western Europe16. Western Europe is, within the Atlantic Pact, the heart of the defence ofthe British Isles and the nucleus of any Western system of defence. Any relaxation of our effort here is bound to have a direct effect on our own security.&apos; It could onlybe justified by the greater danger of over-straining our economy or in the lightof the most careful calculation of the risk of Soviet aggression. Broadly speaking,our obligations here must have the first priority.(ii) N.A.T.O. - . &quot;17. N.A.T.O. is a chosen instrument of United Kingdom policy: throughit we obtain not only greater security, but also prestige and influence with the UnitedStates and our European allies. Any unilateral decision tO. reduce dur agreed share in the defence programme would react, adversely on our position as a world Power,depress the Europeans and hearten.the Russians.- Any substantial slowing up ofN.A.T.O. defence production in general (from which the United Kingdom benefitsequally with others) would seriously compromise .the Western policy of seekingpeace from strength. The course we should.seek to follow is to persuade the UnitedStates to bear a share in the programme more commensurate with their economic strength. ,.. ,        .&apos;,/...42433. b 2    .
Maintenance of Forces in, Europe .: &apos;     &apos;    (iii) Germany]     &quot;.&quot;.&apos; 18. Any.reduction of our forces in Germany in the relatively near future would carry&apos;very serious implications. Partial withdrawal at once or in the immediatefuture would&apos;have a.most disturbing effect in Germany and elsewhere. It would endanger ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty and thereby the strength of the united- effort on which the security of Western Europe depends. In due course, but cer-tainly&apos;not before the&apos;beginning of .1954, German units will begin to be availablefor Western defence. &apos; At that stage, a progressive reduction in our own forces inGermany might perhaps be contemplated. The German contribution to western defence will, however, be&apos; based, like our own, on the normal N.A.T.O. screeningmachinery. If, therefore, there were&apos;a general reduction in our-defence effort, theGermans, and. probably, also the&apos;French, might similarly wish to reduce their own defence effort. The French, in addition might seek economy by withdrawal fromIndo-China&apos;in order to &quot;maintain superiority vis-a-vis the Germans in Europe.Psychologically the reduction and still more the complete withdrawal of UnitedKingdom forces from the Continent, even if kept in being in the United Kingdom,would have a serious effect oh the will of all our European allies to resist aggression.A special factor which may, however, compel us to consider some reduction in our forces in Germany is the fact that after June, 1953, we must be prepared to pay inaddition to our present expenditure a sum probably amounting to about  100&apos; million a year in foreign exchange in respect of the local costs hitherto borne onthe German occupation budget. These should be fully covered by Germany as partof her defence contribution only until June, 1953.:&apos;l     &apos;(iv) Austria and Trieste&apos;- &apos;19.; These&apos;by comparison with Germany are lesser commitments:(a) It is our aim to conclude an Austrian Peace Treaty as soon as possible,-   followed by the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country.  but until this is achieved, there can be no question of a unilateral with-&apos;&quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;  : -&apos;&quot;&quot; drawal on-.our part.  The commitment both in men and money is at&apos; &quot;       present relatively small, though the question of occupation costs might&apos; &apos; /    &apos;   become more acute next year (possibly of the order of  2 million inforeign currency).&apos;&apos;&apos;   (b) Provided that a&apos; settlement can be reached between Italy and Yugoslavia,or be. imposed on them by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the United&apos;- - States Government, the British (and United States) forces could be&apos; &apos; . withdrawn from Trieste.  It is the aim of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to achieve this as soon as- possible.  This would represent a saving of the&apos; &apos;  order of  If million in foreign currency.Category B Obligations(i) Maintenance of security and economic and social development in colonial territories20. The question whether any reduction could be made in the United King-dom contribution, to colonial development is outside the scope of this paper.Possibly some alleviation of this burden might be found (i) Through greater&apos;use of colonial troops to back our major commitments;(ii) Through allocation by the United States of larger funds for investment.   in the colonial empire.. ... .(ii) Commonwealth -21-.., This is another aspect of the problem which is outside the scope of this paper,v.Generally speaking,&apos;however, members of the Commonwealth enjoy the fruits of the, rearmament efforts, of: the free world without making commensuratecontributions. An effort might be Tnade to persuade other Commonwealth countries, to agree.to, relieve, the Upited Kingdom of some of the burden.&apos;-.-,.:; ,,(iii). Egypt and&apos;-.the Middle East&apos;.-.-:&apos;.- 22.&apos;- In time of... war, the Middle-East will have priority second only to western europe:;;Tts. oil is essential to the United Kingdom in peace-time and a proportionof it might well be&apos;essential hrwar.  But it is clearly beyond the resources of the
Un.- 1 Kingdom to continue to assume the responsibility alone: for the securityof lue Middle East. Our aim should be to make the whole of this area and inparticular the Canal Zone an international responsibility. Hence every, step shouldbe taken to speed up the establishment of an Allied. Middle East Defence Organisa-tion. It should, however, be recognised that the setting up of such a defence organisation will not result in any immediate alleviation of the burden for the.United Kingdom. The United States&apos; have refused to enter into any .precisecommitments in the Middle East or to allocate forces, and it should be the constantobject of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to persuade them to do so. In addition, everypossibility should be explored of committing the United States militarily, e.g., to.the building of bases, the provision of material, the sharing and&apos;reconstruction ofairfields. During the present crisis any reduction in the British forces in Egyptis a military problem in which the need for safeguarding British lives and property in case of an emergency must be the first consideration. The dilemma is that until we can come to an agreement with Egypt no effective international defence organisation for the Middle East can be established; and so long as there is nosettlement with Egypt and no international defence organisation we are obligedto hold the fort alone.(iv) Malaya and South-East Asia23. The security and defence of South-East Asia is of very great importance.In conditions short of general war any sign of weakness, involving even a partialreduction of effort there, would be most damaging&apos; to ourselves and an immense-encouragement to the Communists. The remedy here lies in committing the UnitedStates and Australia and New Zealand to the defence of Malaya and Indo-China,perhaps by the establishment of a Far Eastern Regional Security Pact on. N.A.T.O.lines. In the meantime, possibly greater use could be made of locally raised forces^in addition to British and Gurkha troops as available.(v)- World-wide garrisons and bases, &apos;24. Theoretically it might be possible to obtain relief by sharing, upkeep with one or more friendly countries, on the same principle as the Canal Zone might become an international command headquarters. Thus Malta and Gibraltar couldbe made charges on N.A.T.O., Cyprus on the Middle East Command,&apos;Hong kong and Singapore on a Far Eastern Regional Security Pact. Depending on the method and timing adopted, such a policy might be carried through successfully. A veryminor commitment which we could endeavour to dispose of to the United states is the Falkland Islands Dependencies. I do not, however, advise such action, for public admission of our inability to maintain these traditional possessions would cause a loss of prestige wholly out of proportion to the saving in money obtained.It might precipitate a scramble by the numerous claimants to various parts ofBritish territory. , ....Category C Obligations &apos;.(i) Share in international action in Korea25. There are strong objections to a reduction of British forces.&apos; through our contribution we have acquired not only prestige throughout the.free world,but a right to American consideration in matters affecting both Korea and the far east, generally. - ..- &apos;&apos; &apos;     ;      .(ii) Economic assistance to other countries and subscriptions to inter- -national bodies26. The main items here are the grants in aid to Jordan, Yugoslavia, PalestineRefugees and Korean Reconstruction. The. first - of these is primarily a military commitment: while we could consider a reduction here, this might; in&apos; effect, be a false economy in. that Jordan and the Arab;Legion contribute&apos;to Middle east defence and stability at relatively low cost, to ourselves: We :are already-taperingoff our aid to Yugoslavia. We could . consider reducing our contribution to;rehabilitation in Korea. But we could only reduce our help for Palestine refugeesat the cost of arousing ill-feeling with the.Americans. We could also in theoryreduce the scale of our contributions to international bodies.-generally r But this could only be done by,international agreement and,.the saving in money might wellj  be quite out of proportion to the ill-willwhich is likely to be engendered towards.!  the United Kingdom.&apos;      .
Sterling Liabilities27. Finally there is a possibility of reducing United Kingdom sterling liabilities.The total of y United Kingdom sterling liabilities (i.e., including sterling area andnoh-sterlihg-&apos;area^ at 31st December, .1951. ThebiggestiridividuaThblders. of sterling :at&apos;that time&apos;were members, of the Common-wealth, Japan, Egypt, arid11 the&apos;&quot;Colonies.- Theoretically it would be possible toreduce.,these,liabilities,by.scaling.them.down or reducing the rate .of release of sterling allowed for up. individual financial;agreements But from the standpoint offorejgn,po]icy&apos;,this process.must be one brought-about by negotiation and agreement.The ^rospeqt^for&apos; .sucqess pf ,suclvnegpliutigns will vary according lo Hie countryand. the/type:pf.-obligations.&apos;&apos;.-    ,v .Conclusions-. .:&apos;! 28... It-is apparent from this review that there are few ways to effect anyreductions in our overseas commitments which would provide immediate relief toour economic difficulties. Some immediate relief could be afforded by a reductionin jour- economic assistance to certain foreign-countries (paragraph 26), thoughit is very, questionable whether the relatively small economic gain would be worth the loss of prestige and hence influence: we might obtain &quot;some alleviation by arrangements within the Colonial Empire (paragraph 20) and with the Common-wealth, (paragraph.21), and we may be able to save the expense of the maintenanceof British.forces in.Trieste (paragraph 19(b)). But these would be matters for negotiation and persuasion, with no certain prospect of substantial alleviation ofthe.burden on.the United Kingdom.29. If, on a longer view, it must be assumed that the maintenance of thepresent scale of overseas commitments will permanently overstrain our economy,clearly we ought to recognise that the United Kingdom is over-committed and mustreduce the commitment. - The only practical way of removing this permanent strainwould be for the United.Kingdom to shed or share the load of one or two majorobligations, e.g., the defence of the Middle East, for which at present we bear theresponsibility alone&apos; (paragraph 22), or the defence of South-East Asia, where weshare responsibility with the French (paragraph 23). Our present policy is in factdirected towards the (construction of international defence organisations for theMiddle East and South-East Asia in which the United States and other Common-wealth countries would participate. Our aim should be to persuade the UnitedStates to assume the real burdens in such organisations, while retaining for ourselvesas much political control and hence prestige and world influence as we can.As regards the defence of Western Europe, we should seek to induce the UnitedStates to assume a larger share of the common burden. A further substantialalleviation -might be possible in 1954. and subsequent years if the build up ofGerman contingents enables us to reduce British forces in Germany without endangering the common Western defence effort (paragraph 18).30. The success of this policy will depend on a number of factors, somefavourable, some unfavourable. The United States is the only single country inthe free world capable of assuming new and world-wide obligations; being heavilycommitted to the East-West struggle they would not readily leave a power-vacuumin any part of the globe but would be disposed, however reluctantly, to fill it them-selves if it was clear, that the United Kingdom could no longer hold the position(as they did, for example, in Greece). On the other hand, the history of the middle east command negotiations and the unwillingness of the United States Chiefs ofStaff to commit forces to it illustrates the American reluctance to enter into new commitments in peace-time. In South-East Asia only the sketchiest form ofco-operation exists.- Moreover, distrust of the British and fear of becoming an instrument to prop up a declining British Empire are still strong. (This is trueramong Republicans than Democrats, but we - must-clearly prepare ourselves todeal with either Government.) As regards the United Kingdom part, a policyof this kind will only be successful with the United States in so far as we are ableto demonstrate that we are making the maximum possible effort ourselves, andthe more gradually and inconspicuously we can transfer the real burdens from ourown to American shoulders, the less damage we shall do to our position and influence in the world.. &apos; -  - A. E.Foreign. Office, S.W.J,18th June, 1952.
...... : ... ANNEX ,-.-:r.:.... .f.,,.T;r(    &apos;&quot;-;I. The cost of our overseas commitments, cannot be readily&apos;calculated. but certain figures have been supplied to me. which give an indication of the scale.ofcertain elements in this cost.  These.fall under.three-&apos;heads&apos;..     , -(a) The total expenditure in local currencies which is. estimated to-be incurred on our forces overseas in 1952 is approximately  125 - 9 million. Themain items in this are Malaya and Singapore,  31-7 million,&apos;O.E.E.C.- countries (excluding Germany-and Austria, where-we. continue, for thetime being, to received occupation costs)  24 - 7 milli6ri, Malta and Gozo 11-8 million and Hong Kong  10-7 million.To the figure of  .125-9 million should be added  14-7 million foroil for forces overseas giving a grand total of  140-6 million.. this includes the cost of the United Kingdom share of the common infra-structure programme and of colonial forces to the extent that they arefinanced from the United Kingdom exchequer. It does not includeKorea, where payment for local currency issues and United Stateslogistical support has yet to be made and, for different reasons, containsexceptionally low figures for Egypt and Japan.(b) A further figure of  100-9 million for the year 1952 is estimated to coverour expenditures in foreign currencies on behalf of forces in the UnitedKingdom or the forces generally in the following items:- (i) Machinery and Production for defence purposes ( 45 - 3 million).(ii) Manufacture for defence ( 33-6 million).(iii) Oil for forces in the United Kingdom ( 22 million).It is not possible to estimate what part of this sum is attributable to forces overseas.(c) There are also certain figures of overseas expenditure on commitments ofthe type covered by the Vote for Foreign Office Grants and Services.This Vote amounts to  21-9 million.out of a total of  92-7 million invarious votes included in. Civil Estimates. Class 11-1952-53---Commonwealth and Foreign. It includes Jordan ( 8-7 million), Yugo-slavia ( 5-6 million), Palestine Refugees. ( 2-5 million), Libya (2-million), Reconstruction in Korea ( 2 million).2. As regards military expenditure, the total of (a) and (b) above does not represent the full cost of United Kingdom military commitments! &apos; Full cost would include not merely the foreign currency expenditure but also all those costs which are met in sterling, such as expenditure on stores and food, that part of the pay.and allowances of troops and civilians which is not converted into local, currencies,transportation costs of men and stores, &amp;c. .,&apos;.3. The extent to which the liquidation of a particular commitment would produce savings either in overseas expenditure or. in the total defence - budget,cannot be worked out unless information is available on-the manner and extent towhich a reduction in a particular area is envisaged. In particular it would. benecessary to know whether forces were to be disbanded or merely moved elsewhereand also to determine the extent of the terminal charges which would arise if a commitment were to be liquidated.
