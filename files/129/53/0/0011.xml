Locations.-The property is in four main locations, i.e., St. George&apos;sBarracks, adjoining St. George&apos;s town at the eastern end; Prospect, close to thecapital town of Hamilton; Warwick, on the southern coast; and Dockyard,Boaz, &amp;c, at the western extremity.3. Value. Early in 1952 the property was valued by a professionally qualifiedvaluer of the War Office and exploratory negotiations were opened by the WarOffice representatives with the Bermuda Authorities. The negotiations were con-tinued in London in May. The following is a summary of the figures mentioned to date: -(a) It was considered by the War Office representatives that the property wasconservatively worth rather more than  2 million if sold immediately,but if disposed of piecemeal it should realise  3 million.(b) The lowest figure mentioned by the War Office representatives in theexploratory talks in Bermuda was  2-5 million.(c) The lowest figure mentioned by the Bermuda Government during theexploratory talks was  1 million (with a suggestion of more if the dockyard proved to be a valuable commercial asset). This assumedBermuda would discontinue her present voluntary annual contributions to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, of which some  480,000 remains to bepaid over a considerable period.(d) The War Office representatives in their report on return from Bermudasuggested a compromise figure of  If million or thereabouts.4251962Copy No.
(e) In the London negotiations in May, Bermuda made an offer of  650,000(to be paid by  250,000 down and the balance over 5 years) the voluntary annual contributions (paragraph 3 (c)) would continue to bemade in addition. Bermuda also asked not only for the Service propertynow surplus but, in addition, for other property becoming surplus inthe future and certain furniture and other stores as well.(/) The last counter-offer made to Bermuda was  1,850,000  f million downand the balance over seven years.4. The following points have been made by each side during thenegotiations:  Bermuda(i)  650,000 is a fair price having regard to the maintenance costs involvedthrough piecemeal disposal and the restrictions imposed by the BermudaGovernment on the sale of property to non-Bermudians, to preventland speculation.(ii) Most of the property would be used for social purposes (subsidised housingfor the coloured population, open spaces, schools, &amp;c).(iii) There would be serious political reactions in Bermuda to any attempt by her Majesty&apos;s Government to drive a hard bargain.(iv) The Bermuda Government cannot afford more.(v) As between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Bermuda Government thevalue of houses and installations, &amp;c. should not be taken into accountas Her Majesty&apos;s Government has had its full value from them as partof the requirements for Imperial Defence.(vi) The majority of the land was originally acquired about 1795 by her majesty&apos;s Government at prices round  50- 100 per acre.The Service Departments(a) Any figure of the order even of  1,850,000 is below the conservative valua-tion of the property for disposal now.(b) The supply of land is already short and the additional land must be valuableto Bermuda.(c) The buildings generally are solidly constructed and in a reasonable stateof repair. Maintenance has not therefore a high incidence.(d) 225 houses are available in various parts of the Islands which would goa long way to solving the current housing problem.(e) The dockyard area has potential interest for storage, for industrial pur-poses, and possibly as a port.(f) The original price of land acquired in 1795 can have no relation to its value to-day.5.   The possibilities are:  (i) Adhere to Services&apos; offer of  1,850,000.(ii) Accept Bermuda&apos;s offer of  650,000.(iii) A compromise between (i) and (ii).(iv) Failing any of the above, direct disposal by a Service Agency in co-operation with the Bermuda Government (which has been promised).6.    This memorandum r;as prepared in consultation fitti theFirst Lord of the Admiralty. A- ti-The War Office, S.W.1,7th July, 1952.
