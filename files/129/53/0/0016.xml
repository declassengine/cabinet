this document is the property of her britannic  ma.testy&apos;s  government&apos; &apos; Printed for the Cabinet. June 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 216 -:26th June! 1952CABINETA PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY:    Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI very much welcome the Lord Presidents paper, C. (52) 207.Naturally I have had all these matters much in mind and have been preparingwith my advisers for the next forward move. We are governed by two factors; bythe labour and materials available and by the political and economic climate. Ihave not brought to my colleagues any further proposals on private building since i raised the permissible proportion of private licences from 1 in 5 to 1 to 1. I havebeen waiting to learn from the Import Programme and Capital Investment Pro-gramme for 1953. For it would be foolish to step further forward to freedom onlyto be forced back again by circumstances.My instructions from the Cabinet are to build 230,000 houses in 1952, 260,000houses in 1953 and 300,000 in 1954 (Great Britain figures). I cannot say exactly what will be built in 1952. So far we have built 90,000 odd in five months. Lastmonth production was just over 19,000; so unless we run into serious difficulties over fitments I think we will reach the 230,000. As I told the Prime Minister and my colleagues I am anxious about fitments, especially metal fitments. We musthave either more steel for steel windows, or more timber for wooden windows.There has been a big dammed up demand for private building over six years,which our new licensing system has to some extent let loose. For instance, private building starts in May totalled 4,700 against 2,700 in January (England and Wales).There are 116,000 applications outstanding. But like all such queues and long order books this is certainly fictitious. There are already signs of licences not beingtaken up because of the heavy burden of cost and other difficulties of the privateowner.The Lord President says that the subsidised dweller of a council house pays arent of ISs. average. Of course, in fact the rents vary according to local conditionsbut the figure is correct actuarilly, as an average figure. He says the private ownerwill have to pay 455. a week for twenty years. This is, if anything, too low, since it makes no allowance for Schedule A income tax and for repairs.There is therefore a gap of more than 27s. Some of it, of course, ought not tobe filled; for the private owner obtains a permanent asset which the renter doesnot. But the subsidy element in the gap is at least 13s. How can we fill this gap?There are two methods; by the reduction of various imposts or by some form of subsidy or special assistance or both. In respect of the first, the most urgent thingis to get rid of development charge. This I am trying to do. Development chargefalls not upon the landowner, or even on the commercial developer but like every other such tax upon the final consumer. Again, we might abolish Schedule Aincome tax, for houses below a certain value.Direct subsidies can take the form which Lord Woolton suggests, of a lump sum payment per house. It is worth recalling that the Coalition government agreed in 1944 to  100 per house. This was when the subsidy to the tenant was 300. Now the tenant subsidy is  769 ( 577 exchequer and  192 rates). So an equivalent subsidy would be of the order of  250.But there are other and perhaps healthier methods of assistance than directsubsidy (which in any case involves legislation). We are studying in my Ministryvarious methods.   We could arrange for borrowing for Housing at lower rates;42467Copy No.   7,
or over a longer period. Or we might be able to devise some special saving system,the product of which would be directed towards house building and which would encourage house building and saving at the same time. I suggest that a committeeof Ministers (perhaps those studying the Town and Country Planning Act with me) might go into all this.  I am ready.- Every house built without any form of subsidy saves the Exchequer  577 perhouse and saves the local authorities  192 per house;  769 in all. It will be seen,therefore, that even substantial help in other ways will be a gain to the national economy.The Socialists built on the average of the last three years 180,000 houses inGreat Britain to let. If we can build 260,000 next year we ought to try to get alarger number of houses both to rent and for the owner occupier. We have a margin of 80,000. If we can add to some thousands to those available to rentwe shall be in a strong political position. At present, private starts run at the rateof about 40,000 a year.  But they may dry up.Somehow or another, we must get them up to about 70,000 in 1953 and more in 1954Among other things, the strict &quot; comparable needs test&quot; will have to go or be modified.It may be necessary to alter the system of distributing licences, in order to over-come recalcitrant local authorities.These problems require further studying; but no action can, or ought to betaken, until we know what timber and steel will be available for next year&apos;programme.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. I,26th June, 1952.
