this document ls the property of her britannic  majesty&apos;s  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1952m    ;      &quot; :confidential. (52) 21526th June, 1952.cabinet copy No.     6 9ENFORCEMENT OF FOOD controls memorandum by the Minister of FoodEnforcement of rationing and -Other food controls has been a necessary part -etfthe work of fhe Ministry of Food ever since 1939. So long as the need for suchcontrols remains.some provision for enforcing them is inescapable; put in viewOf some recent references in the Press and comments by my colleagues I have &apos;had a -survey made of the -enforcement work of the Department in the light of presentconditions.2. The root of the problem lies in the controls which need to be enforced.We mustiCDncentrate on getting rid of them; but while they remain they cannot beallowed to fall into disrepute or to be openly flouted. The purpose of enforcementis not to follow up every minor breach of the regulations, shut to prevent.open scandalin the form of widespread and flagrant evasions.3. The powers of Food Enforcement Inspectors which are conferred bywarrants under Defence Regulation 55 AA (2) are set out in the attached appendix.The power of entry relates only to a &quot; food undertaking,&quot; and no power is givento enter a private dwelling.4.   The main activities of Food Enforcement Inspectors are now directed against the following types of abuse:(i) Forgery of ration documents, use of duplicate ration books and traffick-ing in coupons. A careful watch is essential,for abuses of this sort couldbreak down rationing. In the first half of 1951 there was a wide distri-bution of forged coupons throughout -the country by gypsies. In thersix: months ended 30th May -there were 424 convictions ,by f he -Courtsfof abuse;of -ration.documents.(ii) Overcharging.   In the Lancashire ;area, for instance, overcharging bybutchers was disclosed in 80 per cent, of the investigations undertakenandsthe average overcharge was around 18.per cent. In all there were,700 convictions by the Courts of overcharging for meat in the sixmonths ended 30th April.(iii) Illicit -slaughter of livestock, which shows no -sign of slackening andrepresents a threat to supplies for the meat ration. -Over the sameperiod of six months 224 convictions by the Courts arose from over400 investigations. These investigations often take much time, for the animals are slaughtered in remote places and evidence is hard toobtain.(iv) &quot;Spiv&quot; trading.without respect for coupons or price control.   Regulartrade associations insist on a reasonable enforcement pressure as acondition of their continued co-operation in working control.(v) False returns by catering establishments.   Rationed food is issued tocaterers according to the meals they claim to have served. A recentspecial check of samples in all parts of the country showed inflation-of-returns in&apos;25 pier cent, of cases examined. &quot;The inflation ranged upto 700 per cent., with, an average Of ;80-per cent.42466
(vi) Black market supplies. In the six months ended 30th April there were some 1,000 convictions by the Courts of dealing in illicit supplies of meat, eggs and feeding-stuffs, although in the last two cases only large-scale offences are taken to Court. The prevalence of illicit dealing inmeat is especially disturbing because, in general, the meat has beenobtained either by illicit slaughter or from illegal disposal of knackeryard meat with danger to public health from diseased meat. &apos;5. I have given fresh instructions that the attention of the EnforcementOfficers must be concentrated on checking abuses which represent a real threat to supplies of rationed food and the rationing system itself. For the most part it istraders and dealers in the black market who must be watched because these arethe people who deal in quantities of scarce foods large enough to affect supplies tothe public.6. I am anxious that the size of the staff employed on this work shall be nolarger than is essential; but the minimum scale of activity depends almost entirely on the area of control. Every abolition of controls helps to make possible a reduc-tion of enforcement staff. The abolition of points rationing and of the restrictionson meals in restaurants, together with a number of price controls, made it possiblefor my predecessor to cut down the number of Inspectors substantially. As soonas we can further reduce the area of control I hope to bring the number downeven further. The present staff is not excessive in relation to the work to be done.It consists of 665 officers (of whom 568 are employed in the Regions, 10 are at headquarters, and the remainder are accountants and other experts). This repre-sents about one Inspector for 85,000 of population, or for 160 square miles in areacovered, and it is barely adequate for the work which still has to be done.G. LL.-G.Ministry of Food, S.W.
