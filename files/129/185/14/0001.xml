BjOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 1144 November 1975COPY no cabinet the ECONOMIC OUTLOOKMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, I shall shortly be circulating proposals for securing major savings in the public expenditure programmes for the years 1977-78 and 1978-79;these proposals are due to be considered by Cabinet next weeke    It wasagreed, however^, that before we took decisions on the public expenditure programmes in the medium term, we should take a look collectively at theshortar^term economic outlook and the unemployment prospects02,        Our forthcoming decisions on public expenditure must be related tothe prospects for 1977 and following years.    These prospects are very different from the situation which faces us in 1975 and 1976.    The immediateoutlook is a difficult one on two main counts:i. Although output should rise throughout 1976 there will be asubstantial lag before this affects employment.    So unemploymentwill continue rising, though at a decreasing rate, and may reach a peak of nearly 1^ million in late 1976 before it turns down again.ii. We are not expecting any improvement in the balance ofpayments.    The current deficit is likely to be much the same in1976 ac in 1975, because the expected increase in export volume willbe offset by increasing imports as the economy recovers, and by a deterioration in the terms of trade as world recovery leads to a risein the price of raw materials.    In addition debt interest will produce a fall in our invisible surplus.    On present forecasts, which areinevitably unreliable so far ahead, our balance of payments woulddeteriorate in 1977.All these estimates are open to a wide margin of error since they must bebased on assumptions which are themselves uncertain.    For example, theyassume not only that the present pay policy is effective but also that we continue to reduce the rate of inflation in the next pay round.    If we do not succeed in this, the prospects for output and the balance of payments coulddeteriorate so strongly as to put the whole economy at risk.
3o One consequence of the depth of the recession is that the public sector borrowing requirement is now forecast at  12 billion for 1975-76,and shows no sign of falling in the next financial year.    This will undoubtedly shake confidence and compound the difficulties of financing the borrowing requirement.    We shall be under increasing pressure from various quarters to make drastic immediate cuts in public expenditure forthe next 18 monthsc    In my view this would not be justified in presentcircumstances, since it would increase unemployment still further.40        The medium-term prospect is however very different.    From 1977output and employment will be increasing rapidly, and it will be necessaryto bring the public sector borrowing requirement down substantially.    this can only be achieved by raising taxes or reducing public expenditure programmes.    Tax increases on the scale required would be politically and economically intolerable and we must therefore be prepared to reduceprogrammes.    This will be the burden of the argument I shall be putting to cabinet next week.5.        So far as our immediate problems are concerned the scope for any major change of policy is very limited.    In particular, despite the pooreroutlook for unemployment, I am convinced that any general reflation is outof the question in present circumstances.    It would worsen the borrowing requirement and the balance of payments still further, and its effects on confidence would make it impossible for us to finance the external deficit -already a very difficult task; this would lead to an external crisis whichwould take matters out of the Governments hands.    Moreover, because ofthe long lags between fiscal action and output, and then between output andemployment, it would have very little effect on the level of employment inthe period when this is rising ie up to late 1976.6.        On the other hand, there are a number of more limited initiativeswhich I think we must consider:i. The Secretary of State for Industry and I are announcing on November a further extension of the selective investment incentives which I announced in the Budget.    This is designed to persuade firms to start now on capital projects in Britain whichwould otherwise have been delayed or gone abroad.    We believethat this is the best way of achieving a significant early increase in industrial investment at a relatively modest cost in public expenditure.ii. In a separate paper - C(75) 115 - the Secretary of State for trade and I are recommending a further examination of the case for selective import controls so as to protect firms and industries whichare likely to be viable in normal circumstances but would disappearunder foreign competition during the world recession.    We must recognise that the scope for action here is limited, but I hope wecould come to some conclusion in the coming weeks.
iii. In conjunction with the other Ministers concerned I should like to set in hand a detailed study of the case for removing orrelaxing hire purchase controls.    The timing would need carefulconsideration, but there might be an opportunity here to provide a modest stimulus to demand without adding to the borrowing requirement.    There is a risk, of course, that relaxation of hire purchase controls would suck in imports and this means we should examine each industry affected before we proceed.    There may be acase for combining any relaxation with selective import controls inthe sectors most at risk,iv. The Secretaries of State for Employment and Industry and Ihave for some time been trying to identify the capacity bottlenecks,whether of manpower or capital equipment, which are likely to occur in the upswing in 1977 and 1970.    Action to eliminate thesebottlenecks will require co-operation of both sides of industry and ofthe Manpower Services Commission as I am making clear to theNational Economic Development Council.v. The Secretaries of State for Industry and Trade and I should begin a systematic interdepartmental programme for reducing the constraints both at home and abroad to the expansion of our exports.7.        These proposals are all for action at the micro-economic level toimprove our economic performance without significantly increasing ourpublic sector deficit.    Accepting them now would not of course mean thatsome action in the Budget is ruled out.    By the spring we shall have a clearer view of the world economy and of our own prospects, particularly as regards inflation.    Some modest reflation may then be possible and desirable.conclusion.        I invite my colleagues to endorse the approach outlined in this paper.D W treasury Chambers4 November 1975
