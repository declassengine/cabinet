RATE SUPPORT GRANT SETTLEMENT 1976-77(ENGLAND AND WALES)Note by the Chief Secretary,  treasury. I propose a rate of Gk^% for the aggregate Exchequer grant to local  authorities  in England  and Wales  in  1976-77 because:-(a) It would give  local  authorities  sufficient  cash to finance  the volume of current  expenditure which theGovernment has  approved for  1976-77,   and pay and price increases  at an annual rate of around  11% (consistently with our counter-inflation policies),  without  any increase  in  average rate poundages.(b) We announced in July in the White Paper &quot;The Attack onInflation&quot;  (Cmnd 6151,   paragraph  16)   that  &quot;As regardsthe RSG  settlement  for next year,   1976-77,   the calcula-tion of the grant will be  on the basis that pay settle-ments both in the remainder of this year and in nextyear conform to the pay limit&quot;.(c) A higher grant percentage would make a mockery of ourintroduction of cash limits.(d) A grant percentage of 66-J% - 2% more than the 6k^% whichI am suggesting - would be widely regarded  as  a generoussettlement because it would give  at least  200 million of spare  spending money.    As local authorities becameaware  of its  significance,   it would undermine  a lot ofthe good work done by Government and by the consultative council to instill  a sense  of economy in local govern-ment spending.(e) If local authorities  doubt whether our counter-inflationpolicies will be wholly successful,  they have available the large additions to reserves  ( 300 million)  which
the  present  level  of rates  are enabling them to make this year before they need consider increasing theirpoundages.     Even an extra  1  per cent  on expenditure would require  only  100 million of this.(f)     If,   on the  other hand,   local  authority fears  about ourcounter-inflation policies  are more  serious  than this,they will  have  the  assurance  I gave  them that we  areprepared to review the  cash limits  on the grants  &quot;ifthe pace of inflation generally or the rate of price increases  affecting local authority expenditure were substantially higher than those implied in the cashlimits&quot;.2.     It is very easy to  produce  alarming figures  of prospective rateincreases.     This  can be  done,  however,   only by  (i)   assuming that local  authorities will overspend in volume terms,  (ii)   confusingthe annual rates of inflation with the  likely pay and price increases over the shorter period from the RSG settlement inNovember 1975 and  (iii)   concentrating on domestic rate poundagesand assuming that the Government will force these to rise by morethan the non-domestic rates.3.    The  position is  simply put in the following table.Percentage changes in average rate poundages in 1976-77(assuming no  overspending and no  drawings on reserves)Increase in annual rate Grant percentageof inflation assumed bylocal authorities 64 65 66^-0.0 -2.9 -7.211%                                                      2.4 -0.5 -4.912%                                                 4.7 1.8 -1.515%                                              11.7 8.8 +4.-.5There is nothing here to alarm local authorities;     and no grounds for local authority associations or commentators to deduce that large rate increases are implied.4.    In fact,  it would be clear to them,  as it would soon be clear to many individual local authorities,  that a grant percentage of66-J% would leave them with excess cash.
5.    The willing co-operation of the Consultative Council  on local Government  Finance  from the  summer onwards  over the&quot;standstill&quot; in the volume  of expenditure,   and  their more recentacceptance of our decision on cash limits,  both encourage  the thought  that  they want  the  Government to behave in  a tough andconsistent manner.       That  is what Gk^% means.conclusion.     There  are two possible  political views  for us.     One  is  thata grant  of 6G^% will be  attractive.     The other is  that most people  in the  country -  and that  includes many Labour MPs  and party workers - want to  see  an effective  squeeze  imposed on local  authority expenditure.     A lower percentage  grant,   andavoidance of increases  in rate  poundages,   is more  likely toproduce  this result  than a higher percentage  grant;     the  latter would not reduce  the rate poundage,   it would  simply meanpositive  encouragement  to overspend.       I recommend  a rate of6ki%.J.B.HM TREASURY13 November 1975
