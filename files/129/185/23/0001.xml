112 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT81C(75) 123 COPY NO14 November 1975CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT:  1976-77Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. We must now take a decision on the amount of help which centralgovernment should give local government in order to help with theprovision of services in 1976-77.    We give this help by way of a grant onthe estimate of the expenditure they will incur on those services in 1976-77.The grant, known as the rate support grant, is a block grant in aid of all services and is expressed as a percentage of the estimated expenditure.2. We are not in dispute about the amount of expenditure on which thegrant for 1976-77 should be calculated (and so no Public expenditure survey Committee (PESC) issue is at stake); nor about the way the grant should be distributed.    The sole question is the percentage of grant.MISC 104 were agreed that the present rate should be maintained.    TheChief Secretary, Treasury, dissented.3. At present the grant rate is 66^- per cent.    I want to keep it at thatrate first because I want to maintain the co-operation of local governmentin keeping down expenditure.    No Government has ever before reduced therate of rate support grant;  indeed it has risen in every one of the last nine years.    To reduce it would be regarded by local government as an act ofbetrayal.    They have reluctantly accepted, and loyally urged on their members, our decision that the expenditure on which the grant is to bebased should represent a standstill compared with the expenditure which isoccurring in 1975-76.    A standstill means, in effect, some authoritiescutting some services in order to allow necessary growth in others - adecision which will dismay our supporters as it has already dismayed theTrades Union Congress Local Government Committee.    Moreover, theyare disturbed by our proposal to impose cash limits - a proposal which Isupport - which they see as eroding their independence,,    To reduce therate of grant below the present level would be a further blow.    It could verypossibly mean a refusal any longer to co-operate in Government economic policies through the medium of the Consultative Council.    Our best friends(Thomas, Goodwin, Sherman etc) would regard it as a kick in the teeth, and say that they were keeping to their side of the standstill bargain while theGovernment was not keeping to its side.1
4. My second concern is what will happen to rate levels next March.In order to take a view about this we must take a realistic view about:&quot;i. &quot;What expenditure local authorities will undertake in 1976-77in real terms.    I do not think that local authorities will, with thebest will in the world, be able to reach an absolute standstill.    Theevidence from discussion about individual services with theauthorities is that there will be an overspend of about 1 per cent.(Thic will still mean a reduction in the rate of increase over a three-year period from 10 per cent to 5 per cent to 1 per cent - a remarkable performance, and certainly better than centralgovernment has achieved).    We could not of course state thispublicly but it would be foolish not to take it into account whenlooking ourselves at what is likely to happen.ii. The rate of inflation which local authorities will assumewhen setting their rates.    The period for which they have got tomake an assumption is from now, ie November 1975, to outturn(roughly September) 1976-77.    The Treasury&apos;s calculations on cashlimits show that 7 per cent would be a reasonable figure for thisperiod, on the assumption that the Government^ counter-inflationpolicy works.    I agree that this is the broad level of figure whichwe must put into cash limits.    But it is not realistic to count on local authorities all assuming such a low figure for that period whenthey come to make their rates.    They will remember previousestimates of inflation given under Conservative Administrationswhich were wildly optimistic.    They will not believe that 7 per centwill represent the likely rate of inflation for the next 12 months (forthis is how the matter will appear to them), and they will take ahigher figure as their assumption for inflation - probably something like 10-12 per cent,5, The following table shows what will happen to domestic rates on an assumption of 1 per cent overspend and making various assumptions aboutthe rate of inflation which local authorities will assume.    It also makes theassumption, which I recommend we should endorse, that we should main-tain the domestic element at its present level - that is the relief given to domestic ratepayers.    The local authorities were unanimous in recommending this.Domestic rate poundage increases (%) in 1976-77ILikely inflation assumed by local Grant Percentageauthorities	64	65	66 7%	8	5	-110%	18	15	912%	25	21	1615%	35	31	26
6. If, therefore^ local authorities choose an inflation rate of 10-12 percent, as I believe they will, and if we cut the rate of grant, we should then have rate increases of between 15 per cent and 25 per cent next spring -just at the moment when our counter-inflation policy will be coming undergreat strain.7. This is essentially a political issue0    The question is whether, forno gain to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in public expenditure terms (forthe PESC figure is not affected - it is only the distribution between central and local government expenditure which is at issue).    We risk breakingour current excellent relations with local government, provokingdangerously high rate increases next spring, and putting ourselves in ascapegoat position in the local elections aext May.8. I believe this would be foolish, and I therefore invite my colleagues&apos;agreement to setting a grant percentage on rate support grant for 1976-77 of667 per cent.A department of the Environment14 November 19753
