MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 106COPY NO   o i14 October 1975 0  cabinet an APPROACH TO INDUSTRIAL STRATEGYNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for industry. The task we face is a daunting one - nothing less than a reversal of the relative decline of British industry which has been almostcontinuous since at least the end of the 19th century.    This is notsomething we can achieve overnight.    It will be a long haul and the fullbenefits will only emerge in the long term.    But we must start theprocess now.2. The attached document sets out the Governmenfs proposals for thedevelopment of a long term industrial strategy.    We believe that any approach to an industrial strategy must contain two ingredients.    First,it must be realistic and flexible.    Our proposals will involve a carefulanalysis of the performance and prospects of individual industries whichwill be open to continued adjustment as experience grows and circumstanceschange.    This wii] not be a rigid strategy but a flexible framework withinwhich strategic decisions can be made.    Second, it is vital to engage theco-operation and drive of both industry and its work-people.    We intend to do this by thorough discussion on a regular basis with representatives ofboth sides of industry, both at industry and at company level.    We needbetter decisions both by companies and by Government.3. The objective we seek is a coherent framework for the operationof the Governmenfs new instruments of industrial policy.    Although the framework is primarily concerned with long term problems, as it developsit will increasingly help short term policies to be framed against a longer term industrial perspective.    We regard our proposals as a major and constructive step towards the development of a much greater commonsense of purpose among all concerned with the future of British industry.D W HE G v cabinet Office14 October 1975
DitAVl&apos; KEDCi PAPER:    &quot;AIT APPROACH PC INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY&quot;t;v   THE CHANCELLOR CP THE&apos; EXCHEQUER AED THE SECRETARY CP STATEFOR INDUSTRYIntroductionCur prime objective niust be to become a -high output-high wage economy.This can only be achieved by improving our industrial.performance endraisin-r; our growth of productive potential.    Our economic performancesince the war has not been satisfactory, reflecting in large part out failure by comparison with our competitors to deal effectively with our  -industrial problems.    The Government is introducing powerful newinstruments to tackle these problems, in particular planning agreements and the PIP.    We must ensure that these,  and the other weapons in ourarmoury, are used to purposeful effect.    This calls for a soundlv^b^sedl/as a guide for manpower planning.    In some sectors of industry the pressure of international competition will force some shed.;P:g of labour.    in others, technological improvements in productivity may mean, that asmodernisation proceeds, the same or a larger output can be produced witha smaller labour force.    It is therefore of the first importance todevelop a coherent industrial strategy so that&apos; action can he taken in.good time by Government and companies to expand capacity and increaseemployment in sectors with good prospects or in others to take defensiveaction where this is necessary. Manpower policies(training, re-training, encouragements to mobility)nustbe   geared in withthis strategy.2      The National Economic Development Council has held a series of discussions about the need for a greater degree of industrial planning and at the August Council m meeting the Government undertook to produce a caper setting out a new approach to an industrial strategy which could then be fully discussed by all the parties.    The development of any ouchstrategy is inevitably a, long and difficult task.industrial strategy for manufacturing industry. The other need
xiiis paper sets ov.the approach which the Government considers likely to be the most Irealistic and fruitful.    It is not a strategy but a programme for developing a strategy which will place responsibility on Governiaeion unions and on management to improve our industrial, performance,Background3.     She health of our industry, and in particular manufacturing industry, which accounts for about 30% of our output and empioymeand over 80% of visible exports, is of vital importance to our national economic performance.    Cur manufacturing industry appearnot to have responded adequately to changes in the pattern of wo?-trade and to suffer from structural rigidities which show themsekin particular in bottlenecks - both in manpower and components inthe. early stages of upturns in the economy. The. reasons for our relsjpoor performance by international standards have been exhaustive!;:analysed and discussed, not least in the Council and the economic development Committees, and there is no universal agreement on theSome important factors, such&apos;  as an over-valued exchange rate and tburden of international responsibility, may now be less serious.Others, such as a limited supply of labour for industries to draware inescapable.    But the main relevant,&quot;and clearly inter-relatefactors are thought to include:Inve stmentLabour(i) a low rate of investment(ii) inefficient use of capital, which)has resulted in a poor&quot; increments,output-capital ratio.(iii) poor choice of investment.(iv) inadequate development of a manpojpolicy and the consequent 1 (region and sectoral) shortages of skillelabour.(v) low labour productivity reflectin,poor management, inadequate consutation, restrictive practices, ovmanning and disruption by1 industraction.
(vi) attitudes to productivity and labour-mobility based on views aboutappropriate pay ana tax structures,reflecting long-standing attitudesto relative pay in industry.Government (vii)       sharp and frequent changes of aconomiregulators to meet the conflictingneeds of economic and social prioritimaking it difficult for companies to plan ahead.(viii) pre-emption of resources by the publisector and &quot;by personal consumption tothe detriment of/industry s investment and export per ormance.(ix)Finance (x)(xi)(xii)4.     There is no reason to &quot;believe that our problems will sortthemselves out as a result&quot; of favourable economic developments.Indeed, on the international front the situation is likely to become more rather than less difficult - intensified pressures from the developing world to set up its own manufacturing capability, increasedcompetition from low cost producers, and a build up of pressures whichcould affect both our terms of trade and the security of supply of foodstuffs and key raw materials.Elements of an industrial strategy5*     To tackle our underlying problems and to improve our industrialperformance will call for action by all parties concerned, Government,management and the unions, underlining the need for an agreed notionalstrategy towards industry on a long term basis.    Such a strategy mustnationalised industries&apos; performanceaffected by Government interventionon pricing, investment and employmentpolicies.a declining rate of industrial pro-fitability,imperfections in the capital marketsmainly at the medium and longer termends.a capital market which does not give priority to the needs of industry.
i. the bettor co-ordination of policies affectingindustry having regard to their contribution to growththrough industrial efficiency.    In particular thisdemands a more positive identification of the industrialimplications of the whole range of government policies, and the feed-back of information from planning agreements with companies will he of particular value.ii. the more effective use of specific instruments of industrial policy and the deployment of financialassistance to industry.    Both planning agreements andthe HEB wall he important instruments in this field.iii. ensuring that industry,both public and private, is ableearn sufficient profits        on its successful invest-ment to spur managements to expand and innovate andto provide them with the basic finance to do so.Adequate sources of external funds are also vital:    seme v.li;be provided through the National Enterprise Board and some tiFinance- for Industry, hut it will also he essential that themarket should he able to meet the needs of industry.iv. a more effective manpower i:)policy, includingmeasures to provide a better supply of skilled man-power for growth industries and to cope -with the human problems of redeployment from contracting toexpanding industries.   Training and retraining willbe crucial here, both in coping with the problems ofthe present recession and in enabling people to meetthe needs of a re-oriented British industry.    The NSCand its agencies will have an important part in this..v. the improvements in planning, both in industryand by Government, which will flow from systematicand continuing tripartite discussion of the likelyprospects of individual industries,&apos; allied to greaterdisclosure of information.at company level,particularly, but not exclusively in planning agreements,.Above all, the need is to get away from policies of confrontation;to work together in the national interest towards agreed common siand objectives.6.,     For its part, the Government will need to continue to balanceeconomic and social objectives which often have conflicting impliitions for policy.   Nevertheless, the Government intends to give!greater weight, and more consistently than hitherto,, to the needt
increase the growth rate through regenerating our industrial structure and improving efficiency.    This will mean giving greater priority forthe immediate future to industrial development over consumption, or evenour social objectives.    Only in this way can we maintain the industrialbase without which the Government&apos;s whole programme of economic and social.reform cannot be fulfilled.    Success in achieving our aims will depend on a complex variety of factors needing support at national,industry and firm level end. requires proper co-ordination of macro andinicro-poli c i e s.   But we must recognise that this is not a. solution tothe short term economic problems which we face now.7      One response to the problem might be for the Government to set inhand a new National Plan.    The likelihood is that any plan which erecteda single complete ard mutually consistent set of industrial forecastsand targets would rapidly he falsified by events and have to be discardedThis would once again discredit the .rocoss of industrial planning in.this country, as have previous attempts which failed, largely because theywere based on unsustainable economic aosuiiiptioriSj and paid too littleattention to the constraints affecting individual industries and companieOur rational response to changes in circumstances and lack of early andvisible success was to abandon the plan in question, rather than J ike theFrench or Japanese, to revise it and try again.    As a result resourceshove tended to be dissipated with too little result.    Accordingly we find ourselves without any co-ordinated strategy to provide a consistentbasis for Government and industry to consider the likely prospects ofthe most important industrial sectors over a. period of 5 or more years ahead and to indicate their role in meeting the overall economic objectives.    This should be discussed extensively with both, sides ofindustry as part of the development of the closer and more positiverelationship between Government and industry to which the Government is committed in the White Paper on the Regeneration of British Industry.The framework would need to be reviewed and if necessary adjusted, at
regular intervals, to take account of changing circumstanced.    Thinktie in with what the Government intends to do in planning agreements with major companies as well as with Government planning of public expenditure and nationalised industry investment.uneworK8..     Ihe first step is the provision of a systematic statistical andanalytical framework.    Although this can ultimately be broadened totake account of other useful information, including work currently inhand in the Rational Economic Development Office, we propose that the framework should initially rest on two main elements:i..     An analysis of past performance of individualsectors of manufacturing based on a number of statistical indicators such as size, growth rate,trading performance, import content, growth of world demand and importance to other sectors.A key factor would be the competitiveness of theindustry at home and abroad.    This process will help identify the importance of individual sectorsin achieving various objectives.ii.    The implications for different industries and sectors of alternative medium term growthassumptions, using as a starting point theGovernment&apos;s medium term projections.9* The Government would make an initial assessment on the basis othis statistical framework, taking full account of a wide range ofqualitative factors, such as the scope for improving on past perforaathe potential for import substitution, the development of new technolminimum economic size of plants, the security of future raw materialssupplies (for example our self-sufficiency in energy by 1980), the impact of e.c. membership, the emergence of new overseas competitors aiithe industrial objectives and policies of other Governments.
the10.   The aim will he to identify those sectors most important for achieving our economic objectives   both for the Governmenfs purposeend for those of private industry.    This will entail a sector&apos; by-sector analysis to identify those which are likely to have mostpotential and those which may be expected to present problems.    Thiswill involve a first grouping of the most important industries ifollowing way:industries which, judging by past &quot;performance and current prospects are intrins.ical.I3/- likelyto be&apos;successful.- industries which, though they fall short ofthe first category have the potential forsuccess if appropriate action is taken.- industries whose performance (as in the caseof component sixppliers) is most important tothe rest of industry.It is of course clear that any industry can contain sub-sectors and individual firms whose prospects may be better or worse than the sectoias a whole.The use of the industrial framework1.1.   This analysis is not in itself an industrial strategy.    It isa starting point for the development of the Governmenfs ownindustrial planning and a framework for discussion and action by theGovernment and by both sides of industry at national, industry and.company level.    At each level, the objective must be to tackle theproblems listed in para 3 above, which lie at the root of ourinadequate industrial performance since the war.i.     National Level12.   At the national level, there is a wide range of government policies affecting industry.    For these policies to operate effectivelythe Government should be able to assess their effects on individualsectors of industry to take account of them in policy formation.    Theproposed medium term industrial framework should contribute to thisby providing a way of analysing the factors affecting the prospects for various sectors, including the impact of changes in the government&apos;s general economic policies.
13     This sectoral framework can on!y be a part of the Government&quot;s totalstrategy governing its relations with industry.    Quite apart from policies for selective intervention (discussed further bellow) industry&apos;will want&apos;ire;the Government an assurance that a priority objective of economic managerialwilt be to allow it to earn a reasonable irate of return on capital.    The.Government has indeed made it clear that it accepts the importance ofsustaining a&quot;vigorous, alert, responsible and profitable private sector of industry.    Industry will also want closer consultation on medium termmnrro-economic ,prospects..    v;e have made a. start here by circulating toKkJX&apos;! the main components of the Government&apos;s medium term projections and vieshall be ready to consider ways of carrying this further to complement thediscussion of.sectoral prospects which will take place on a regular basis as indicated in pa.paragraph 19 below *ii   Trdustry level14     There will need to be extensive discussions of the analysis of industripro3poets with each of the industries identified within the groupingsdescribed in para 10 above.    The IfDCs will have a great deal to contribute to this, and they wad 1 be able to draw upon the work they have beenundertaking for the NEJ3C&apos;s Medium Term Industrial - Review.    The structure and operation of the KDCs&apos; machinery nay have to be looked at in the lightof this new development.    Other sectoral or gen i s at i on s such, as trade associations may also contribute to the discussions.15     The indicators which EEDO are preparing (NEDC(75)       ) will hevaluable at this stage in assessing the scope for improving performancewithin each sector.    Publicly owned industries will have an important role to play in improving our overall industrial performance.since it is just as important that labour and capital resources are efficiently used in thepublic as well as the private sector.    Just as they will, he brought intothe planning agreements system, it is the intention that the nationalised industries should come within the scope of the strategic planning process.This will, for example, enable the long term plans of the nationalised industries and their supplier industries to he related to each other and tothe whole industrial framework.    But since most of the nationalised indust-ries are utilities rather than manufacturing industries, most -of them arenot, with the notable exception of steel, likely to feature in the groupingsof para 10,o(J
16    The detailed discussions are likely to throw further light on possible constraints to improved performance and the industrialimplications of projections and decisions.    They might also make specific recommendations for action by companies, trade unions and Government,although the selection, of sectors is not intended to imply any commitment that the Government will necessarily intervene.    v,&apos;hile the Government musretain ultimate responsibility for the allocation of resources the industrial framework should provide a basis for determining priorities for action . in specific areas of particular importance to the economy,within the inevitably limited resources available.    This will contribute to the development of priorities for co-ordinated intervention and suppornot only by the Government itself but also by public agenci.es such asthe KEB and the Manpower Services Commission.iij   Comnany level17     The Government would also discuss the industrial projections andarosaecis and their implications with individual companies, primarilythough rot exclusively in the context of planning agreements..   It isthe individual decisions taken by management and unions at the levelof the firm which will in aggregate determine the Pk&apos;s industrialperformance and planning agreement discussions should in due courseprovide a valuable means of influencing a significant proportion ofthe UP&apos;s manufacturing sector.    Y/hile some firms will hove opportunities. . it would be the. aim&apos; to improve the overall standard of a sectorwftich are not, available to oiners in a given eecior/ bp raising tirestandard of average companies toward that of the best.    At trie level.of the firm, the Government will be concerned to provide support where this is justified in individual cases - eg assistance for hey investment projects - and the HBB will have a role in promoting changes in themanagement and organisation of individual companies as well as by securing desirable restructuring of a sector.    In deciding on the case for support to individual companies the Government will need to haveregard to the criteria in EEDC(75)67, including the need to ensure that each company has the prospect of viability in the longer term.    the framework and the development of a strategy
will provide a comprehensive base for Government policies both focompanies in growth sectors end for dealing with the problems of companies in sectors with deteriorating prospects. Here detailedknowledge of the Government&apos; s thinking, and the Governmenfs coirmeat to take full account of the agreed strategic framework shoulallow companies generally to plan ahead with greater confidence.:&apos;-v a   Procedure18. As Las been made clear the Government view the development p!an industrial strategy     . . not as a one-offoperation but as a continuing and evolving process, with arrange:for regular review after the initial discussions and agreement.19.    The Government therefore envisage that in a normal year therewould be a three stage operation on the following lines:    first the late summer material   would be put to the NEDC which would coiof three main parts:i. a paper setting out the main components ofthe Governmenfs medium term projection;ii. a paper identifying the most importantsectors grouped in accordance with para     10and.indicating the criteria /&quot;and indices^?which had been used for this purpose.    As&quot;the30 or so sectors would have been chosen primarily for their importance to the economy, it is unlikely they will change significantly from year to year, although as experience of thesystem develops it may be possible to add furthercriteria for selection.   Nonetheless the Govern-ment expects that the Council will wish to comment on the criteria chosen for any one year&apos;-s review;iii. separate annexes for each&apos; of the sectorslisted.    These would contain figures, whereavailable, for the appropriate disaggregated partof the Government&apos;s overall medium term projections.They -would also include a. descriptive profile ofthe industry which woulcjftraw attention to its main problems and opportunities and. in particularwould attempt to identify areas where future trendswere likely- to differ from those in the past. / Two-specimens are attached as an appendix to this paper. 7
20.     Second, subject to the Council &apos;s endorsement of. the Government&apos;approach to the year1s review, material in iii. would be remitted to individual EDO&apos; si or where no appropriate EDCs existed, to tripartitecommittees which at    least in the early stages would be set; up ad hoc.It would beii the EDCs, or ad hoc committees, that both sides ofindustry together with Government would attempt to identify areas for improvement and possible action.21.   Third, the results of these discussions will be pulled together,perhaps by an official group representing the Government, TTJC,GBTand KEDO and submitted; to the Council at about the turn of the year.This report wotild then form the basis for an important discussion bythe Council on industrial policy and in particular on areas high light ecfor action and improvement, at a suitable time of the year to influenceGovernment thinking on macro-economic policy.22.   None of this would in any way prevent or inhibit discussions inthe Council or the EDCs at other times of the year on issues related to industrial strategy or the particular aspects of industrialperformance.    But it would provide a framework which would relateNEDCs main discussions on industrial matters to the Government1sown t ime t ab 1 e.23-   At this initial stage of development, the timetable for consuita-tions must be treated, flexibly.    As explained above,the preparation of a sound statistical base entails a good deal ofwork, because much of it is breaking new ground and requires theapplication of considerable resources to develop techniques.    However,the aim is to produce an experimental analysis for consideration bythe Council early in the New Year!.    After discussion in the Council,the detailed examination at sectoral level could begin, although again at this stage it might need to be regarded as to some extentexperimental, and. progress might usefully be reviewed by the Councilabout the middle of next year when revised medium term projectionsshouh. become available.    If we are to stick to this timetable theestablishment of any additional groups that may be necessary will need to be set In hand quickly.
24     The Government recognise? that the proposals in this paper deallargely with procedural natters and that the Council cannot take a&apos; fview about the merits of the new approach until it has had the furthflpaper we hope will he ready by the turn of the year.    However the Go-moni; does ai iach great importance to this new approach because they nit is the right way do move towards a solution of our long term inch;problems. &apos; They therefore invite the Council to agree that the fi-rth!work that lias beer, described should be undertaken and should be hrou-forward for discussion early in the hew Year.25 V/hen these industrial strategy proposals have been developed,Government will be in a position to examine the needs and problemswide range of industries and companies against a coherent framework,playing its part in helping to meet these needs and to overcome theproblems the Government will bring tc bear the whole range of its pIt will be able to frame its general economic policies to take accomore systematically of industrial needs. The not will be able to nfinance for companies in key sectors. Selective financial assistwill be used to encourage and assist viable projects and the sector?discussions should enable appropriate schemes, like those for the fe.foundries, machine tools, clothing, and textile industries, to be developed. The TdSC and its agencies will have a major role to play in meeting the needs of growth sectors for suitable trained, manpower in easirg the problems arising from industries shedding labour. TheGovernment is confident that the use of these instruments, and the oilat its disposal, in a coherent and planned way will make a major irn:on the problems we have set out.
PLTROCKEnlCALSPRODUCTS1 The petrochemical industry is defined as that employing.largescole processes to chemically convert and separate organically basedraw materials, mainly naphtha in the United. Kingdom.    However, it isdifficult to define the sector more precisely because of the range of products, the extent and variety of the processes used in themanufacture     of- chemicals derived from oil and gas.    The statisticalcategory most nearly covering the industry is HLH 271-2, OrganicChemicals.   The basic products of the sector are Olefins (ethylene,propylene and butadiene) produced by cracking;    and aromatics (benzene,,toluene and xylene) produced by reforming.    The fol3owing figures give1974 sales in thousand tons:    ethylene (1,275)? propylene (663),butadiene (212), benzene (696), toluene (252).    The value of sales ofthe sector at actual prices rose from  413m in 1968 to  53z*-m in 1971and is estimated to have approached  1,500m in 197/&apos;-- - The syntheticresin, rubber and fibre industries are major users of the output ofthe petrochemical industry.RAW MATERIALS AND PROCESSES2        Naphtha, the major raw material for the petrochemical industry isf uQ 1itself a joint product with gasoline and heavy/oil from crude oil..    Toa significant extent naphtha is produced at the expense of gasolineand. thus rates of growth of gasoline consumption together with rates oiexpansion of cracker capacity can affect the availability and priceof naphtha for use in the petrochemical industry.   United Kingdom,naphtha use in the petrochemical industry is around 6-Jm tons of whichslightly less than 4-m tons is for the production of ethylene.    In thecourse of 1973, naphtha prices rose from around US 4^5 to US $120 perton in response both to administered crude oil prices and to demandderived from products of the chemical industry.   Prices have fallensince early 197^-, though not to earlier 1973 levels and there is no immediate shortage of naphtha.    Various factors may be leading to theuse of other feedstocks in futurec    Gas oil is relatively more aburdairthan naphtha and gives more co-products, particularly propylene.Natural gas liquids (ethane, propane and butane) are available in larg,quantities from the North Sea and may find a use in petrochemicals.3        The production of ethylene is around 30% of naphtha input but thproportion can be varied within limits by varying the severity of thecracking.   Propylene and butadiene are the major co-products;    marketshave been developed for these chemicals and they are now much&apos; in demon.
A problem in planning new capacity is to ensure that there are markets for all these products which have somewhat different market growthrates.MARKETS4        The main derivatives of the basic olefins and aromatics areplastic materials (polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene,polypropylene etc) with a wide range of uses in packaging, constructio:household wares etc:    synthetic fibres;    plnsticisers and solvents;synthetic rubbers and detergents.5        The very wide range of products into which petrochemical derivedprodxicts enter have led. to estimates of demand for petrochemicalproducts being based on estimates of the growth in gross domestic product.    Prut this simple judgement needs to be amended by differingsectoral growth rates wdiich. affect petrochemical demand since petro-chemical products are concentrated to some extent in particularsectors., end the effect of substitution of other materials for petro-chemicals in production and consumption as a result of petrochemicalprice rises.   The latter .are thought to be slight by the industry.Also petrochemical and petrochemical derived product imports will affecthe relationship between UK petrochemical growth and market growth and must be considered.   The volume of organic chemicals (MLH 271.2)output increased by 12% pa in 1958-73? or five times as fast as gross domestic product.    Since the peak reached in 1974 output has fallen20-30/O in 1975*    Demand may not have fallen as much because consumershave run down their stocks.    Further sectoral analysis of the majororganic chemicals markets and substitution patterns is necessary toarrive at a more market based estimate of output growth.   However, thegrowth of output experienced in 1968-73 is not likely to recur between1975-85.STRUCTURE, SUPPLIES AND CUSTOMERS6        The large scale and capital intensity of plant in the petro-chemical industry together with the inter-dependence of products andprocesses has led to heavy concentration of the industry.    The fourcompanies manufacturing ethylene in this.country are either integrated with the oil production and refining industry which produces naphtha(BP Chemicals, Royal Dutch Shell and Esso) or with the manufacture ofother organic and inorganic products (ICI).    Each of these companies have plants overseas and have to plan increments to capacity not only &quot;conform with their estimates of United Kingdom market growth and eachcompanies share of this, but also with reference to capacity surplusand shortfalls of their overseas plants.
7        The most economic size of an ethylene plant is now about 500,00Ctons provided it is run at full capacity and its cost some  IPOmillion.    There is increasing evidence of petrochemical companiesjointly planning and building capacity;    BP anr] sign have jointlyannounced a plan to build an ethylene plant to come on stream onTeesn.de in 197?.    This has the obvious advantage of spreading the risk]and the cost:    but another most valuable benefit is that it eases thetask of arranging for the absorption by the market of this very largeincrement to capacity.TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION8        Estimates of UK trade in organic chemicals at current prices forthe years 1966-74 and for the first half of 1975 are shown below,,    Theinadequately represent the importance of the industry for overseastrade since products of the industry are also an important element inother UK exports, for example in plastics products.TRADE IN ORGANIC CHEMICALS  Mil1ion, Current Prices1st Half1966   1967   1968   1969   1970   1971   1972   1973   1974   1975Exports 70      75      99     110     136     154     161     244     545     214Imports 85      95     118     136     161     14?     161     237     506     2099        The very strong rise in exports and imports of organic chemicals.in 1973 and 1974 partly reflects the large price increases stemmingfrom the increase in naphtha costs.    After adjusting for changes inprices it is estimated that the volume of exports has grown at about11% per annum while the growth of imports has been slightly lower inperiods of slack domestic demand and slightly higher in periods of peal?domestic demandc    Figures for the first half of 1975 reflect the weakdemand in both the UK and overseas.10      In 1973 and 1974 exports accounted for around one-third of domestic production while imports accounted for around one-third of consumption.   Consumption of petrochemicals in Western Europe has grownat almost twice the rate in the United Kingdom and is expected tocontinue to do soaINVESTMENT11      The volume of organic chemicals investment averaged  115m pa,at 1970 prices, in 1970 and 1971 but fell sharply to average only  55mpa in 1972 and 1973*   Since then investment has recovered slightly.3
If ethylene demand and output in 1975-85 increased at half the 196&apos;--&apos;,rate., or at about 6% pa, one more 500,000 ton ethylene plant will netto be built to satisfy UK demand in addition to the cracker planned f1977k    If UK ethylene demand and output in 1975-85 increased at two-thirds of the historical 1968-73 rate, or at about 8% pa then two additional 500,000 ton crackers would be required, bringing installedcapacity to 3m tons.    Estimates of the downstream investment needed ttake advantage of new ethylene capacity have been put at about four times the cost of an ethylene plant.EMPLOYKENT12       Between 1970 and 1973 employment in the organic chemicals(MLR 271.2) sector fell by 34- thousand while during the same periodoutput rose very strongly.    Although changes in employment must tendon the whole to be influenced by past changes in output, it seems unlikely that employment in 1975 will be higher than in 1973o    Averagrate of increase in output per head in the period 1963-71 was 7*8%,based on Census of Production data.    Although direct employment in thipetrochemical industry is low, the indirect employment created if outis processed domestically is higher.PROSPECTS13      The particular advantages of siting petrochemical production inthe UK lie in the political security of North Sea supplies of oil, gasand natural gas liquids, their proximity and availability and theexistence of sites with deep water access.    Attention has, therefore,been focussed on the question whether these advantages would enablethe UK to capture a larger share of the European market and by addingvalue to a greater proportion of these North Sea feedstocks to gainbenefits in terms of balance of payments and employment.14-       It is unlikely that UK companies, even if they had the financial resources, could expand their share of European markets quickly enougThe best chance of exploiting     these feedstocks seems to be throughoverseas companies with established European markets building in the.Ito serve those markets, plants which would otherwise have been builton the Continent.

1      Ferrous founding involves the remelting end refining of iron or steel, pouring the molten metal into a mould.    Cn removal from the mouldlimited amounts of finishing are. carried out according to the end useof the product.    Ferrous eastings are classified under L&quot;.f.H 311 and 313and are essential components for many industries.    Over one-third ofthe tonnage is used by the vehicle end tractor industries, a similarproportion goes to engineering with the remainder serving a wide variety of industry including coal mining, railways and construction.    Thesupply of ferrous castings was a serious constraint during the 1973industrial upturn and this might well he so again.Market Trends2      The value of UK production in 1974 was  6481/1 for iron castings and 125m fcr steel castings.    The total tonnage has fallen since the earlyI960&apos;s due in part to substitution   by alternative materials, particularin the building sector.    In contrast the tonnage supplied to. the vehicleindustry has increased:-VehiclesTractorsEngineering industriesBu i 3. d i n g and al 1 i e dDomestic goodsPressure pipes and fittingsIngot, moulds and bottom platesMiscel lane ousExportsTotal:&apos;000 tonnesProduction of iron castings19631974f000 tonnesdeliveries ofsteel caatings1953974558	803	15	16287	200		979	745	148	158455	314	...	...117	64	...	523	340	...	....451	A20		...348	304	.   67	62included	above	10	293718	3190	240	2653      Meanwhile, there have been substantial, improvements in productquality eg lighter spheroidal, graphite (SG) iron has substituted forgrey iron for pressure pipes and fittings and in some sec tors of the

Structure of the Industry

8 There is a considerable diversity of size in both iron and steel sectors as demonstrated by the numbers of foundries in three broad size categories in 1974:-

Iron

Annual output (tonnes) No %

Small Under 1,200 415 54

Medium 1201-5000 220 28

Large Over 5000 133 18

758

Steel

Annual output (tonnes) No %

Under 2,000 45 54

2500-6250 26 31

6251 and over 13 15

84

Types of company range from independents, tied foundries operated by engineering and vehicle companies, and foundries in the public sector including British Steel Corporation and British Rail. Major companies in the iron sector include Birmid Qualcast, Glynwed, BSC and BIMC. In the steel sector F H Lloyd is the largest group (in fact the largest steel castings group in Europe) and the Weir Group is also sizeable.

Plant and Equipment

9 A large part of the plant and equipment in the industry is antiquated, a result of inadequate investment over many years of cyclical activity with the associated problems of cash flow and profitability. In many foundries, although the capacity is nominally adequate in tonnage terms, the plant is inadequate to meet present day requirements of higher quality castings and safer and cleaner methods of production.

Average age of ferrous foundry plant in years

Iron Steel

Buildings 41 40

Melting plant 19 15

Sand plant 12 15

Finishing plant 12 13

10 It has been estimated by the industry and NEDO that the cost of replacing buildings, plant and equipment at current replacement cost is £630m in the iron sector and £140m in the steel sector. On a 15 year replacement basis, this implies annual capital expenditure of £50m.


Epy i rnrancnta 1 Control and Safety ar:ci Health Renuircr.or.ts11     In addition to replacement and modernisation of existing proce-lthe industry is faced with increasingly stringent requirements bothrespect of tighter environmental control standards, parti.cu3.arly onmelting plant,  and a more rigorous application of the Safety and Heat Work Act.    The industry has estimated that compliance with these!requirements over the next 5 years will cost about  90m, the burden being particularly heavy ait the very smallest and the very largestfoundry locations.Elnarinlsl Position of the Indi;strv12 The ferrous foundries have had a persistently low level ofprofitability. Recent data from REDO and the industry has demonstrcflthat in the past 4 years gross profit (after depreciation and before!interest and tax) has been in the order of 6-9?&apos; of turnover for bcuffsectors. Expressed as a percentage of net assets, the iron sectorin the order of 15-21$ and the steel sector 6-14$.13     Against this background the industry and PESO have estimated tilextent to which the industries would be able to raise from iniernalijgenerated cash flow, the additional funds required for modernisationover the next 5 years.Average annual net Average annual 1974 eash flowcash flow (1971-74) investment as $ of forecas m at 1975 prices required  m requirement(1976-1980)Iron 43 54 80Steel 7 14 51Total 50 68 74Thus the industry&apos;s ability to finance the necessary investment fro:internal funds would fall  short by some 26$.    Given in particulardepth of the current general recession and the extreme difficultyfoundries would have in achieving higher prices for their products,is a serious position. ,Probloms faced by the industry14 &quot;   Given its present position the ferrous foundry industry faces a formidable task over the next few years.    The reasons for this may&quot;summarised:- :.-   A   -

This should take account ofthe effects of the  25m allocated for the Ferrous Foundries Scheme offinancial assistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act recently announced.16     In audition it will he important to consider the means by which, theindustry can improve its level of profitability and devise better methodsof coping with the trade cycle by diversifying products and improvedmarketing in consultation with major users.   -In this connection, theactivities of the newly formed EDC forferrous foundries could improve the yrecess cf. consultation with user industries and enable companies to see their own position better in a national context.17    The problem cf manpower supply, labour relations and training inthe foundry industry is also ore which will need careful study and effective action by the industry.    Its efforts in this direction have been assisted in recent years by the Foundry Industry Training Committee(under the umbrella, of trie Engineering Industry Training Board) and recent initiatives for training and retraining by the Secretary of Statefor Employment will be of particular assistance to the foundry industry.
