DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 12113 November 1975CABINETSPEAKERfS CONFERENCE ON ELECTORAL, LAWMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentINTRODUCTION1. The work of the last Speaker&apos;s Conference was interrupted by theGeneral Election of February 1974.    The Conference had been able toreport on several topics, including service voters&apos; registration, multipleregistration, the minimum age of election and election expenses.    Noreport, however, was received on most of the topics that had been includedin the Conference^ terms of reference.    In April 1974 the Cabinet(CC(74) 8th Conclusions) decided not to take any initiative over reconveningthe Conference, particularly in view of the possibility of a furtherGeneral Election that year.ELECTORAL REFORM2. It is now time for a new Conference to be convened, and a list ofthe topics to be referred to it could readily be agreed.    The major issuefor decision is whether the question of electoral reform should be includedin its terms of reference.    Consideration of electoral reform would naturally concentrate upon the issue of proportional representation, whichin turn raises questions of the size and number of constituencies.3. There has been a considerable amount of public interest and commentrecently on the subject of electoral reform, on which the traditionaladvocacy of the Liberal Party - traditional for a few decades at least - isnow meeting with a response in other quarters.    The publication of our proposals for regional assemblies in Scotland and Wales will inevitablyfurther stimulate debate on the subject.    It seems right that we should now submit it for examination, in an appropriate forum, though basically in the context of elections to the United Kingdom Parliament.copy NO    ^
4. The Liberal party, and perhaps the Nationalist parties, are almost certain to oppose the reference of electoral reform to a Conferencecomposed predominantly of MPs who may be expected to defend the presentsystem.    Traditionally however, matters of this sort have been discussed by Speaker&apos;s Conferences.    On balance, I think that this is the right course;  but, particularly since a Speaker^ Conference could not beexpected to produce a fully reasoned report, which a subject of thisimportance might be thought to demand, I believe that there would be advantage in appointing an additional body to prepare the ground for theConference^ deliberations by carrying out a detailed survey of the varioussystems of proportional representation and, without expressing anypreferences of their own, by distilling from this a series of objectivelyframed questions which the Conference might be invited to answer whensubmitting its final recommendations.5. Such a body might cnnsist of people of some eminence in public life, or of acknowledged expertise, and mostly from outside Parliament.I contemplate that it should be able to take evidence and that its report forthe Conference should be published.    The aim would be to set it up at aboutthe same time as the Conference is convened, that is about the end of theyear.    Its report should then be ready at about the end of 1976, by which time the Conference ought to have completed its consideration of theother terms of reference.COMPOSITION OF CONFERENCE6. The last two Speaker&apos;s Conferences were composed of the speaker and 29 MPs.    On the usual basis of allocating this number of places in thepresent House of Commons, there would be 15 Labour MPs, 12 Conservatives,1 Liberal and 1 Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), together with the Speaker.Given the subjects for discussion, there may well be claims for move places for the minor parties, t&quot;* ensure separate representation for the Liberals,the SNP and the mster Unionists.    I propose that we should assume initiallyin the consultations that the usual pattern would be followed.    The only practical alternative would be, I suppose, to have an equality of Governmentand non-Government membwe, apart from the Speaker: for example,15 Labour, 12 Conservative and 3 from the other parties, possibly one eachfor the Liberals, the SNP, and the Ulster Unionists.CONSULTATIONS7. The normal procedure is for the composition and terms of referenceto be discussed with the leaders of the political parties and the Speaker.If the proposals contained in this memorandum are approved, a more detailed agenda for the Conference will be put to Home Affairs Committee,and discussions could take place as soon as they had been cleared.    the subsequent announcement about convening the Conference could also refer to the establishment of a separate body to prepare the subject of electoral reform.2
recommendation. I invite my colleagues to agree;-a. that consultations should now take place with theleaders of the political parties and the Speaker aboutconvening the Speaker!s Conference on the basis I havesuggested;b. that the question of electoral reform should beincluded in the Conference^ terms of reference; andc. that a separate body should be set up to prepare areport on electoral reform, on the lines indicated inparagraph 4, for subsequent consideration by the ConferenceR H j home Office13 November 19753
