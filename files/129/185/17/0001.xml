DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 117 Q1COPY NO       0 16 November 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1979-80Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. This year&apos;s public expenditure review has followed the procedurewe approved in May.    Cabinet considered the likely outcome of the medium-term economic assessment (MTA) in July, and they also agreed thestatement I should make about public expenditure in debating &quot;The Attack onInflation&quot;, which made it clear that the Government would be seeking further substantial economies, particularly in 1977-78 and 1978-79, and that therewould at best be very little room for growth beyond the reduced level for1976-77.    We had a preliminary exchange of views about priorities at chequers on 4 August.    Officials have now completed the Survey Report(C(75) 116) and the official Steering Committee on Economic Strategy hasmade its comments (C(75) 118).    We now need to take early decisions onthe programmes as a basis for the annual White Paper on Public expenditure which is normally due at the end of the year.THE ECONOMIC background. The first point to make is that we are not concerned here with theimmediate problems of world-wide recession.    In the short run spendingcuts of the kind constantly urged on us by the Opposition would raiseunemployment still further and make our situation worse.    My proposals inthis paper for expenditure reductions are therefore concentrated on theyears beyond 1976-77, except where a decision in that year would have alarge and irreversible effect on expenditure in later years.    I cannothowever rule out the possible need to reduce some programmes in 1976-77if this proves necessary to offset increases in other programmes beyondthe level at present planned or if there is a marked further deterioration in our economic position.3. The situation beyond 1976 will be very different.    International and domestic demand should have recovered and the forward planning of resources must be based on the assumption that unemployment will befalling rapidly.    The decision before us is therefore essentially as follows:given the total quantity of resources we can reasonably assume, how should we allocate what is left after allowing what is needed for the balance ofpayments and investment?
4. First, what quantity of resources should be used directly by theGovernment - to provide education, to construct roads, to maintain law andorder, etc?    The greater the &apos;direct&apos; public expenditure of this kind, thesmaller the quantity of goods and services available for personal consumption.We must expect that if wage earners are not content with their share they may seek through excessive pay claims to pre-empt resources intended for investment and the balance of trade.5. Secondly, of the total resources available for consumers to spend,how much should come out of their own pockets, and how much out of the government&apos;s purse byway of transfers like pensions and subsidies?    Thelarger the transfers the greater the re-distribution of income betweenpeople who are working to create the nation&apos;s wealth and the rest -particularly those who are retired.6. In coming to a view on these questions we must take the tax implications-tions into account;  transfers no less than direct public expenditure have tobe financed by taxation.    We shall face formidable problems if on top of the tax increases needed to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement(PSBR) as the economy recovers, rising public expenditure makes necessary a further substantial increase in the tax burden.    Moreover the tax system has been seriously distorted by inflation.    Duties have not risen in line with prices, and the real value of tax allowances has been eroded.    More andmore people on low incomes are being drawn into the tax net and there is increasing overlap between the social security system and income tax, ofwhich the poverty trap is a disturbing example.    Correcting this situationover the next few years will be made more difficult by the tax implications of the public expenditure programmes as estimated in the MTA.    I am circulating a separate note on these issues as Annex A.7. Finally, there is Government expenditure on the acquisition ofexisting assets.    So long as the assets are used by the Government asefficiently as by their previous owners, and their products are sold ateconomic prices, this may not have much effect on the resources position,and hence on taxation.    But if compensation is paid in cash it raises thePSBR and if paid otherwise (eg by stock) it makes the financing of any givenPSBR more difficult.    In one way or another it thus adds to the problems of managing the Governmenfs finances.THE MEDIUM-TERM ASSESSMENT8. So far as the quantity of resources likely to b*a available is concerned,the medium-term outlook has not altered radically since the July medium-term assessment.    But if we incorporate the Survey figures (which involvesassuming that the formula reductions would be implemented - a decision wehave not yet taken) the slower growth in the public sectorJs direct use of resources would make more resources - for instance, labour - available forindustries where productivity grows relatively fast.    In that case theestimated rate of growth would be a little faster and make a little moreresources available.2
9. The MTA is based on past trends.    I have stated repeatedly that euraim must be to do significantly better than we have done in the past;  manyof our present economic troubles are due to years of low growth, and weshall find it easier to overcome the problems ahead if we can increase ourrate of growth.    This is, of course, why we are putting such emphasis onour industrial policies.    But in the meantime if industrial investment is higher than has been allowed for in the MTA there will be even fewerresources available for public expenditure and private consumption - thiscut would be additional to those proposed in this paper.    For instance,the increase in manufacturing investment asked for in &quot;Labour and Industry;The Next Steps&quot; implies a level of manufacturing investment in 1979 about15 per cent higher than that allowed for in the MTA.    The offsetting cut in public expenditure would have to be of the order of  1 feillion at 1975Survey prices, depending on the resource costs of the programmesconcerned.10.       Moreover, past trends provide no guidance about the effect on our economic performance of the current high rates of inflation.    We must therefore face the possibility that the underlying rate of productivity growthmay, at least for the time being, be significantly less than the MTA assumes.The higher the rate of inflation, the more difficult it is to return to highemployment, and the lower, once again, the growth of total resources willbe.    If we hold the  6 limit in the current wage round and achieve further reductions in inflation in later years, we are more likely to achieve the medium-term performance as projected in the MTA.    But the ultimatesuccess of our attack on inflation is bound to depend in part on how muchroom our public expenditure plans have left for growth in the living standards of working people.11.       There have been big increases in total public expenditure in recentyears.    In volume terms it rose by about 6 per cent in 1973-74 and 8 percent in 1974-75, and the latest forecast suggests that it will rise by over4 per cent this year.    This is an increase of nearly 20 per cent in 3 years,while the gross domestic product (GDP) at factor cost is expected to rise by only lj per cent over the same period.    The ratio of public expenditure toGDP, which was 45 per cent in 1965, rose from 51 per cent in 1973 to about60 per cent in 1975.    We have been able to enjoy these increases in public expenditure without corresponding increases in taxation because of the highsavings ratio and the balance of payments deficit.    But we cannot return to public sector deficits of a size which would be acceptable in a normalsituation without large cuts in expenditure programmes in 1978-79 if big taxincreases are to be avoided.    For the reasons I have already given, theresource prospects may turn out to be less favourable because the projectionsof the growth of the economy over the medium-term, while consistent withour broad economic objectives, depend on a range of assumptions aboutdomestic and external developments which in the event may not be fully realised.    But even if all goes according to plan in this respect, the medium-term outlook for taxation is particularly disquieting.3
THE TAX IMPLICATIONS12.       I have summarised in Annex A the main features of the present and prospective tax position of wage-earners.    The tax structure is alreadyseriously distorted, and the effects of inflation and the need to raiseadditional finance are producing anomalies which it is difficult to defend.These are particularly marked amongst the lowest income earners, butthey also affect the more highly-paid skilled workers.    Tax rates and national insurance contributions mean that over 40p out of every extra poundearned is taken in tax once a man crosses the tax threshold.    A married manon two-thirds average income now pays nearly a fifth of his wages in incometax compared with just over 4 per cent in 1960-61; a married man on average earnings pays nearly a quarter compared with 10 per cent in 1960-61.For the taxpayer earning above-average wages, including a large number oftrade unionists, the burden is of course even greater.13.       Because it has not been possible to adjust tax allowances and taxbands in line with inflation, social security benefits, particularly the levelof supplementary benefit which must be taken as an indication of the&quot;poverty line&quot;, are constantly pressing hard against the tax threshold.    Thishas produced the problems of the poverty trap and is drawing increasing numbers of low income recipients into the tax net.    People on the basicnational insurance retirement pension are rapidly approaching the taxthreshold.    It is difficult to justify a situation in which people pay tax eventhough their income is below the maximum level of supplementary benefit.Simply to eliminate the fiscal drag of  1, 200 million estimated for thecurrent year would probably require adding something like 3p to the basic rate of income tax.14.       On top of the action needed to remove these distortions, there arethe substantial overall increases in tax which would be necessary even ifpublic expenditure programmes were reduced by the formula cuts includedin the Survey.    There are, of course, a great variety of ways in which thisextra tax burden could be imposed, but the simplest way of illustrating it isto assume that indirect taxes, and all personal tax allowances and tax bands,are adjusted to keep pace with inflation, and then to see how far the rates of income tax would have to be raised so as to provide the extra yield.    On this basis, the public expenditure programmes after the formula cuts would implyan increase in income tax rates of between 5 and 9p - depending on the savingsratio at the time and other uncertainties.    This would mean that a married man on average earnings would pay about 30 per cent of his wages in incometax; and that allowing for national insurance contributions, once a wageearner crossed the tax threshold he would be facing a marginal tax rate of anything from 45 per cent to 50 per cent.    I do not believe that this is atolerable prospect;  in such a situation wage demands would increasingly bebased on incomes after tax and the task of containing wage inflation wouldbecome insuperable.4
15.       The position is unlikely to be more acceptable if, instead of raisingincome tax, I were to rely mainly on indirect taxes - eg putting up the VATrate, or raising duties on items such as tobacco, beer and petrol by a good,deal more than the rate of inflation.    These taxes would, directly increasethe retail price index, and again make our counter-inflationary policyimpossible.    Increases in company taxation would either be passed throughinto prices or would reduce the funds available for investment.    Capitaltaxes would contribute nothing of adequate size and are low in resourcecontent.16.       There have been very large increases in the estimates of debt interest in all years from 1976-77 onwards, due mainly to the very rapid growth of the PSBR and its prospective continuance at a high level for atleast the next year or two.    The estimates are subject to a substantialmargin of error, but the future level of debt payments, which are of courseinescapable, will undoubtedly be very high.    They are now expected to amount to around  7, 500 million in 1977-78 at 1975 Survey prices, and. thiswill give rise to very severe financing problems.    But since their demand,content is relatively low for interest paid at home, there is correspondinglyless need for tax increases or offsetting reductions in expenditure.    the implications for taxation have been taken into account in the illustrativefigures in this paper and the Annex but even if the whole of the debt interestincrease since the last White Paper were excluded the tax increase would still work out at a substantial figure.    There is a compelling case for reductions in expenditure programmes quite apart from the prospectiveadditional burden of debt interest.17.       I regard it as essential that public expenditure programmes arereduced sufficiently to ensure that by the end of the period the rise in the tax burden is kept to tolerable levels.    The figures I have given above show ;that even on the possibly optimistic MTA assumptions, this result will not beachieved if we limit the reductions in the expenditure programmes to thoseresulting from applying the formula,    I believe therefore that we should aim at the higher end of the range of the  2- 3 billion (at the prices of last year!sSurvey) mentioned in our earlier discussions, ie at something like  3-f billionat 1975 Survey prices.    I recognise that this implies painful decisions andwill be far from popular with our supporters.    But I do not believe we reallyhave a choice.    Either we grasp the nettle now and revise the programmes to a level which is likely to be sustainable, or we can expect that later in the lifetime of this Parliament we will encounter a serious crisis - or successionof crises - in which we would have both to increase taxes and to cut expendi-ture in a way which was much more disruptive to our programme and more damaging to our political prospects.    The risks are very unequal.    If wecut too little now and are compelled to make violent changes in our plansover the next 2 or 3 years, the consequences will be catastrophic both forour economy and for our survival as a Government.    If we prove to have cut too much we can restore the balance rapidly and win popularity in doing so.5
BASIS FOR THE WHITE PAPER18.       I therefore propose that in deciding the programmes to be presented in the White Paper we should seek total reductions in 1978-79 of the order of 3f billion at 1975 Survey prices, with appropriate reductions in 1977-78and 1979-80.    This would produce figures as in the table below.  million at 1975 Survey prices1973-74  1974-75  1975-76  1976-77  1977-78  1978-79  1979-80Expenditure           40,910    44,214    45,946    45,460 44,470 43,850 43,780programmesCOnti.ng.enCy                                               100         500 900 1,200 1,400-250 -250 -250 -250reserveShortfallallowanceTotal public expenditure(excluding debt interest)% increase on previous year- in volumeterms- in demandterms40,910    44,214    46,046    45,710    45,120    44,800   44,930-r4, 8       +8.1 +4.1 -0.7       -1.3       -0.7        +0.3-1,3       -0.7        +0.419.       My colleagues will wish to consider how this could be done inaccordance with our broad political priorities as a Government, and with theleast avoidable disruption to programmes.    The proposals in Annex B are anillustrative list as a starting point for discussion.    If, however, my colleaguesprefer to exclude any of the items, it would be necessary to substitute an itemfrom the reserve list of policy options in order to make good the deficiency.The substituted item would also need to be one which would have broadly thesame effect on demand.    If my colleagues wish to propose any such exclusionI hope therefore that they will be prepared to specify precisely the reductionwhich they would prefer instead.    Similarly, if the Cabinet wish to approveany of the current proposals for additional expenditure which some of our colleagues are putting forward, these too must be offset by items from thereserve list, or by other offsetting savings, if we are not to pre-empt ourcontingency reserve.
20.       Implementing the proposals shown in this list would significantlyreduce the amount of additional taxation necessary to balance the economy bythe end of the Survey period.    On the same illustrative basis as inparagraph 14, i.e assuming that indirect taxes, personal tax allowances andtax bands are all adjusted for inflation, the required rise in income tax ratesmight come down by about 4p, from 5-9p to l-5p.    This implies that the marginal tax rate (including national insurance contributions) on passing the tax threshold would be somewhere between 40 and 45 per cent, instead of between 45 and 50 per cent, at the end of the period.21.       The illustrative list takes the Survey programme figures as its pointof departure.    I fully recognise that the Cabinet&apos;s approval in May of theformula for the Survey did not carry with it agreement to the reductions which the formula implies.    But the Survey figures provide a fully analysedstarting point from which we can make adjustments up or down, and Ipropope that we should use it as such.    This means that all the &quot;formulareductions&quot; (column a. of Annex B of C(75) 118) would be implemented unless,as the reflection of our priorities, some alternative option from outside the package was submitted.    The &quot;formula reductions&quot; do not even reach thelower figure of the range mentioned in paragraph 16 above.    The illustrativelist therefore contains also the following, drawn mainly from the policy options illustrated in the Survey Report (column b. of Annex B of C(75) 118),for those programmes to which the percentage reductions were not applied.22.       Social security.    This programme shows a large increase onCmnd 5879, largely due to the effect of basing upratings of pensions and other benefits on past movements of earnings or prices (the &quot;historical method&quot;),at a time of declining inflation.   Pensioners have rightly done better thanthe working population since we came to office, but to apply the &quot;historicalmethod&quot; of uprating next year would give them a further large relativeimprovement, which would be the adventitious result only of inflation slowing down more rapidly.    I propose therefore that we should switch from the&quot;historical method&quot; to the forecasting method for the 1976 uprating.    Wecould draw an analogy with the new policy for incomes under which pay increases are related not to past inflation but to future targets.    If necessarywe could give compensation, when we make this change, for any ^oss1 bypensioners from the previous use of the historical method.    We would stillbe able to say that the 1976 uprating was intended to satisfy the commitment that pensions should keep up with the movement of gross pre-tax earningssince July 1974, when we raised single and married pensions to  10 and  16.I see no need to do more than this.    This change would need to be announced,but would not require legislation.23.       I have not included in my illustrative list any change in the gross earnings basis for uprating itself, although that might need to be looked atagain if economic conditions require it or if other reductions prove hard toget.    We shall however need other savings.    We should stop the earningslimit of  20 for pensioners rising faster than earnings.    This will require legislation by the end of the year to reverse the Opposition amendment which7
was recently enacted.    I have included restriction of unemploymentbenefits for better-off occupational pensioners under retirement age;  andof supplementary benefit for students (already under discussion).    We shall also need to consider whether to defer the child benefit scheme, which,unlike these other options, would not require legislation, or to adopt a combination of other smaller options from the list in C(75) 118 which wouldtogether secure similar net savings.24.       The total reduction in the illustrative list for 1978-79 is up to 618 million.    For the most part, this would however only go to offset the increase - itself largely due to the existence of the &quot;historical method&quot; -of  561 million between Cmnd 5879 and the Survey.    By comparison withother programmes, there would not be a big reduction on social security inthat year between Cmnd 5879 and the next White Paper.25.       Housing.   I think we are obliged to look for a major contribution from this programme which has grown enormously in the past 3 years.The Survey formula required the 1976-77 Budget cuts to be carried forwardinto the subsequent years and the illustrative list consists of the threepolicy options identified in the Survey.    The option on new house-buildingtakes account of the views expressed at the Chequers meeting on 4 August:it would allow building by local authorities, new towns and housing associations to run from 1976-77 onwards to around 35 per cent higher thanthe average for the past five years.    In the present situation, we mustimpose a limit on the total amount of new house-building which is publiclyfinanced; but the proposed limit does not imply any restriction on building in areas of greatest stress.26.       Trade, Industry and Employment.    This is an area to which we haverightly given high priority even in our present difficult economic situation,and I have therefore not included any specific proposals in the illustrativelist at this stage.    Moreover some elements in it are not at present pro-grammed and are a charge on the contingency reserve, which is one of thereasons why the Survey Report proposes that this year we should reconstitutea rather larger contingency reserve than that in Cmnd 5879f which has been exhausted in the space of a few months;.    Nevertheless, while this programme should continue to carry a high priority, we must be all the more careful tosee that projects are stringently appraised.    We must also take steps where we can to secure reasonable savings.27.       Nationalised Industry Investment.    These programmes have alreadybeen the subject of a separate appraisal, and have been considered by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy, the outcome of which is summarised in Annex C of C(75) 118.    The illustrative list proposes that weshould now implement the suggestion that the telecommunications and BritishRail investment programmes should be levelled off from 1976-77, and thatwe should reduce the subsidy to British Rail, yielding savings in 1978-79 of 71 million on telecommunications and  140 million on British Rail.8
28.       Other civil programmes.      The food subsidy programme is planned to decline throughout the period, and the illustrative list assumes a somewhatsharper rate of decline, saving  30 million.    A greater saving would bepossible if it were desired to spare some other item.    Some small savings could be achieved be reconsidering the new bus grant and by reducing thegrant to the Civil Aviation Authority.    The list includes an increase inprescription charges.    It also proposes a limit on expenditure under theCommunity Land Scheme, although the alternative of proceeding no further with the legislation remains open for discussion.29.       Defence.    The Defence Review was completed before the deterioration-tion in the medium-term economic prospects, and I cannot believe that wewould have reached the same decisions if we had been doing it now.    Weare now faced with the need to curtail all public expenditure programmes,and in this situation, when so many other desirable features of otherprogrammer will have to be foregone or postponed, defence must be seen to be malting a very substantial contribution to the new savings required,at least equivalent to the application of the percentage formula which hasbeen used as the yardstick for other programmes.    The illustrative listproposes therefore that the Defence Budget should be cut by that amount,ie  450 million in 1978-79.CONCLUSION30.       I invite my colleagues to agree -i,       that the total of expenditure programmes (excluding debt interest, contingency reserve and shortfall) should be set at 44,470 million in 1977-78,  43, 850 million in 1978-79 and 43, 780 million in 1979-80;ii.       to achieve that objective, the programmes in the white paper should be based on the illustrative list in Annex B to this paper, subject to any variations which the Cabinet may wish tomake by substituting, for the reductions shown in the list, otheroptions of a similar amount (taking account of the generallygreater effect on demand that results from reducing directpurchases of resources rather than transfers).D W treasury Chambers6 November 1975 9
TAX PROBLEMS IN THE MEDIUM TERMAs a proportion of national income the total tax burden of taxes of all kinds and National Insurance contributions isa little over two-fifths.     We are also spending more thenour revenue yield.     So long as the public sector deficitdoes not get out of hand this is acceptable - indeed it makes economic sense - in recession conditions.     Once the economy picks up, and to sustain the recovery, the need tomove into better financial balance will become urgent.     this implies reducing the public sector deficit, either by curbingthe growth of public expenditure or by increasing taxationor, more likely both.2.     The need for a substantial increase in the tax burden isimplied too by the growth prospects for the economy over the medium-term.     Extra taxation will be required to&apos;containprivately financed consumption to the level necessary to achieve the Governmenfs objectives for the balance of payments and for domestic investment.     The medium-term assessment (MTA)estimate of the required rise in tax yield assumes that the tax system will fully adapt to the effect of future inflation.This means that indirect taxes are projected to go up withrising prices.     Extra revenue is still needed in part to help to achieve the required distribution of resources, but also tohelp finance the revalorisation cf income tax allowances, whichis implied by the inflation assumption.3.     The prospect for a continued rise in the tax burden isdifficult enough.     But the problem does not end there.     TheMTA makes no provision for correcting the distortions alreadypresent in the tax system.     These distortions throw a shadowforward over the medium-term tax prospects, and make the financing problem that much more difficult.
4.-    In recent years, for example, the balance of taxationhas shifted from indirect taxes to direct taxes.     As a percentage of the total tax table , income tax.has risen from .31.1 per cent in 1973/74 to an estimated 57-4 per cent in1975/76.     Structural difficulties are developing within theincome tax system because of this shift.     Low income earnershave been drawn in increasing lumbers into the tax net, andthere is growing friction between the income tax system andthe social security system.5.     The fall in the share of total taxation provided byindirect taxes reflects, in part, constraints imposed byIncomes Policy.     Increases in indirect taxes are quicklyreflected in a measurable rise in the Retail Price Index (war)and so feed through directly into \\rage bargaining.     the increases in duties announced in the April 1975 Budget did not take full account of past inflation but they still added 2% percent directly to retail prices within a few months.6.     Some forms of company taxation - employer national insurance contributions for example - increase prices in timealthough the effect on the RPI is less perceptible than VATor duty revisions.     Increases in corporation tax rates reducecompany liquidity and the return on investment.     It isimportant to avoid action which could jeopardise productive investment and so threaten the growth prospects assumed by the111 A.7*     There are also the capital taxes.     But yields are modest- capital transfer tax will yield  315 million in 1975/76 andthe yield of the heavier wealth tax illustrated in the green paper was estimated at between  350 million and  425 million.Capital taxes are largely paid out of savings rather thanconsumption.     Hence while the capital taxes can contribute towards reducing the FSBR their resource content is low so theydo not lead to a significant fall in the weight of taxation onthe general public.secret
8.     The increasing burden of income tax has shown itselfmainly through the raising of tax: rates - revenue has beenneeded to finance rising public expenditure as well as to offset adjustments to allowances because of the erosioncaused by inflation.     Even so the real values of the taxallov/ances and rate bands have fallen relative to income levels.     This is inflationary fiscal drag - about  1200mof revenue in 1975/76.9.     The dilemma is this.     Indirect taxes might be used tohelp close the medium-term financing gap as well as contribu-ting towards eliminating distortions in the tax system.     Butthis would have a direct impact on prices and eventually wagecosts.     On the other hand, increasing reliance on income tax,which is the working assumption used by the MTA, will furtheraggravate the structural pressures which are building up in theincome tax system, and may well have adverse effects on counter-inflationary policy.PROBLEMS OF THE INCOME TAX SYSTEM10,    The income tax burden has increased in recent years at all levels of income.     On the basis of present tax rates and allowances it is estimated that the proportion of personalincome taken in income tax will exceed&apos; 16 per cent in 1975/76(compared to 11 per cent in 1965/66) and will rise again in1976/77*     The latest MTA suggests that, on the assumptionsdescribed above, increases in income tax rates of 5p - 9p will ,be required over the next 5 years.     This implies that by1978/79 a married man on average earnings would be paying about30 per cent of his earnings in income tax.     This compares withper cent in the current year and 10 per cent in 1960/61.Allowing for national insurance contributions,.in 1978/79 hewould face a marginal deduction rate of 45 per cent to 50 percent.11.   Low wage earners have not escaped rising tax rates anddiminishing tax thresholds.     For example:- in 1960/61 the average tax rate for a married couple ,&apos; 3SECRET
at two-thirds average earnings was 4.2 per centoIn 1968/69 it was 9-3 per cent.     In 1975/76 it-is 19.1 per cent.- because of the removal of the reduced rates of tax in 1970/71 the low income earner comes intotax at a much higher rate.     In 1962/63 the lowestmarginal rate was effectively 6.8 per cent comparedwith the present rate of 35 per cent.     The 5-5 Pe^cent national insurance contribution makes this 40-^-per cent.- the increase in the tax burden has fallen heavily on this group.     Below average earners contributeover a quarter, some  3800 million, to the total income tax yield.     The scope for increasing taxrevenue from higher incomes is limited.     If allearnings above  6000 pa were taxed at 100 per cent the additional yield would be  450 million.12.   The taxpayer at average earnings is in much the same position.     For example:- in 1960/61 the average tax rate&apos;as a proportionof average earnings for a married couple was 9-8 percent.     By 1964/65 it was 12.2 per cent.     In thecurrent year it is 24.4 per cent.- real post tax incomes have fallen recently, butrising money incomes may have helped to mash this.In the 6 months to mid-1975 the gross income of a married average wage earner rose by  17 to. nearly- 58 per week.     In real terms (after allowing for tax and national insurance contributions) this implieda fall of 3 per cent.13.   The revalorisation of the main personal allowances in1974 and 1975 were financed by increases in tax rates.     So4
the relief attached to the increases in tax thresholdswas offset as wages increased.     For example:- the benefits of the increase in the main personalallowances introduced in the April 1975 Budget 3?anout for a married man when his wages exceeded  47per week (about 75 per cent of average earnings) .Many industrial workers - Coal miners, engineeringworkers and dockers - have been .overall losers.- taxpayers at 1-^ times average earnings have suffered a sharp rise in average tax rates from 16.4 per cent for a married couple in 1960/61 to nearly 28 per centin 1975/76.14.    In the highest incomes gross pre-tax differentials havenarrowed in recent years.     This process will be accelerated bythe over- 8,500 cut-off in present pay policy.     Between 1974-/75and 1975/76 &quot;the real net income of a married taxpayer with nodependants initially earning  6&quot;,000 a year and receiving theaverage pay increase for those at that level of earnings fellby an estimated 18 per cent.FRICTION BETWEEN THE TAX SYSTEM AND THE SOCIAL, SECURITY SYSTEM15.&apos;  Successive Governments since the war have been faced withthe problem of financing higher levels of public expend.iture,including rising social security expenditure.     This problem is reflected in the friction between the tax and the socialsupport systems.     There is a &quot;scissors-type&quot; relationship.Increased public expenditure on social services (the biggestsingle component in total public expenditure) requires increasedtax revenue to finance it.     Given the constraints on indirecttaxes and the little remaining scope for further direct taxation of higher incomes, this means more and more tax coming frombelow average earners.
16.    This produces anomalies because people are being drawn into tax at income levels which in many cases arebelow social security benefit levels.     PIS recipients have .been drawn into the tax net:    they then face high margined,rates of tax - not less than 90-g- per cent and in some casesas much as 107 per cent with the loss of rent and rate rebates.Pensioners (some 8 million of thorn) are also in danger of beingincreasingly drawn into the tax net.     On current PESO assumpt-ions about the likely size of the November 1976 uprating, therewill be little headroom left between -the standard pension and    ;&apos;the age allowance limit.     There are also problems for pensionrecipients below 65 (mainly single women or widows) and a particularly difficult situation arises on war widows, for manyof whom entry into tax liability will come as a rude shock.After the November 1975 uprating, basic rates of unemploymentbenefit alone will only be slightly below the tax thresholdfor many family types (an extreme example is that of a married man with two children who pays tax on earnings over  18.36 pw,as against basic unemployment benefit of  18 ).When account is taken of earnings related supplement and inparticular, tax rebates on one hand, and national insurance contributions and work expenses on the other, it is possiblefor people to be better off unemployed or sick, than at work,at least for a time.POLICY PROBLEMSRelationships to counter-inflationary policies17*   These policies could be put at risk if Trade Union attitudestowards the wage bargain become influenced by the effect of income tax on take-home pay.     As marginal rates rise and take-home pay falls the maintenance of a viable Incomes Policybecomes much more difficult.     This problem becomes more pressingif increases in personal allowances are financed by a rise inmarginal rates of tax.     In these circumstances there are losersand gainers - and the losers will be the more highly paid workers.This cross-over point ^&quot;is described in paragraph 13*6
Incentives18,   A recent Trade Union Research Unit paper on these issues(Technical Note Wo 2?) recognised that &quot;The Labour Governmenthas increased the severity of direct taxation and particularlyaccentuated its progressive bite into high incomes, to an extent quite unprecedented in peace time&quot;.     The pax^er pointsout many of the problems listed in this Annex.     On the questi*of higher incomes the paper concludes that the further re-distribution of wealth through the income tax involves serious problems of incentives so that much more reliance should beplaced on redistributive capital taxes.19.   The Trade Union paper makes a strong case for not adding to the income tax burden, and indeed implies that it should bereduced.IN SUM20.
