DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S government(75) 102 COPY no 6 October 1975CABINETTHE LAW ON PICKETINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentPICKETING1. While I understand the difficulties of the Secretary of State for employment in this matter, I fear I would regard the consequences of theproposals in C(75) 101 as potentially very dangerous.2. The Secretary of State for Employment and I had considerablediscussions about this matter when the Employment Protection Bill was being prepared for the Commons.    This led to a tripartite meeting with the policeas a result of which I understood that he accepted, albeit reluctantly, thedifficulties for the police and withdrew pressure for the inclusion of a clausewhich went wider than the declaratory provision agreed between us.    It wasthen agreed that we should seek to promote discussions between the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and the police organisations under Home Officechairmanship and with Department of Employment representation.    this offer to pursue the issue has not been taken up by the TUC but, of course,it remains open.3. There is great strength of feeling throughout the police service(including the Police Federation) on this matter.    They rightly regard theissue of picketing as delicate and difficult, and a change at this moment inthe way proposed would jeopardise the balance and impartiality the policestrive to maintain.    Had we decided to propose this change in the summer itwould, at the very least, have required most careful preparation andexplanation.    To spring it on the police now without the further consultationwhich appeared to have been agreed in the summer would, I believe, makethe position still more difficult.4.        As all that is now proposed is to leave out the reference to obstructionof the highway it may be thought only a small matter.    But the omission willbe clearly seen to be deliberate.    It will naturally be assumed that we intend to give the right to obstruct, although without specifically saying so.    Thiswill assume great significance and result in dangerous confusion.    If the new clause became law the courts might hold that it conveyed an immunity from1
obstruction, or they might not*    Pickets would believe that they had a rightto obstruct the highway; the police could, and probably would, take thecontrary view.5, It may further be said that it will have no great practicalconsequences because the strong likelihood is that the House of Lords wouldnot accept it.    The effect this would have on the Governments tightlegislative programme for the remainder of this Session could hardly fail tobe unhelpful, although that is primarily for others to determine.    in substance an abortive attempt to introduce a revised clause into the lords would push the law on picketing into a twilight zone.    Neither police norpickets would know what was expected of them.    In a bad resultingatmosphere it would be more likely that contentious prosecutions would arise.    When we had tried to change the law and failed, the position of theHome Secretary in dealing with those who might be, or had been, convictedwould be impossible.6. In this area I believe the police are genuinely willing to co-operate in order to minimise friction, but there are real dangers at the presenttime of potentially violent scenes, generated by extremists who are looking for trouble.    There are plenty of these about.    Recently such scenes havemostly not arisen out of industrial situations; but with a new uncertainty inthe law, those who want to create them could easily latch on to a picketingscene.7. I very much hope that constructive discussions between the TUC andthe police will take place; but I believe it would be a serious mistake tointroduce a sudden change in the law on picketing that, if enacted, would beambiguous and therefore divisive, and if defeated, would cause confusion and conflict,CONSPIRACY8. On conspiracy it appears, from what we now know of the law commission^ draft report, that the Secretary of State for Employmentsproposal will be met in a Bill which will be published as part of their reportearly next year.    But the Bill will go much wider than the single change proposed to the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875, and can beused as the basis for a thorough reforming measure which will go a long wayto respond to the decision on conspiracy reached by the Party Conference.9. In my view the best course is to await the report and not to actpiecemeal.    This will enable us to appraise the merits of the proposedprovision for the 1875 Act in the context of their recommendations as a whole,and by dealing with the whole area of conspiracy law it will be much easierboth to present the change and to get it through both Houses of Parliament.We could not count on settling the matter were we to do so as the Secretaryof State for Employment proposes.    Without being able to point to the
published recommendations of the Law Commission to support an amendment of the 1875 Act, it would be very doubtful if an amendment would succeed in the Lords.    3f it fails, just as with the proposed amendment on picketing, we have the worst of all worlds.R H j home Office6 October 19753
