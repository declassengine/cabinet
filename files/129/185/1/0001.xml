DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO      81CABINETTHE LAW ON PICKETINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for EmploymentBACKGROUND1, Our Election Manifesto last year promised that the EmploymentProtection Bill would include new safeguards for peaceful picketing.    Duringthe passage of the Bill, it has become clear that there is widespreadsupport within the Party for such legislation.    At Report Stage in the commons there was heavy pressure from our own supporters and real danger of a successful backbench revolt, which I was able to avert only by giving firm assurances that the Government would renew its search for an acceptable way of changing the present law, and would if at all possibleintroduce amendments in the House of Lords.THE RIGHTS OF PICKETS2. Two main forms of amendment have been canvas sed:-a. A declaratory provision making it clear that the rights ofpickets are not limited to attendance, but extend also to seeking to persuade others (including those in vehicles) by peaceful means.The Home Secretary and I considered that such a provision wouldbe helpful in clarifying the law and it was included in the EmploymentProtection Bill as Clause 99 (see Annex).    However, the clause was regarded as inadequate by our own supporters and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and the Opposition secured its deletion in CommonsCommittee, with most Government supporters abstaining.b. A provision conferring on pickets a limited right to obstructvehicles in defined circumstances, subject to conditions (eg. as tonumbers, location, identification).    An amendment on these lineswas moved by Jeff Rooker on Report, and won considerable support from our own side; it was defeated with the assistance of theOpposition.1C(75)10125 September 1975
3, I have recently had further discussions with the TUC    They havemade it clear that they do not favour any amendment of the Rooker type(b. above) - partly because they fear that it would reduce the flexibilitywhich the police at present have in controlling picket lines. In view ofthis, I do not think we should initiate or support amendments of this kind.4. What the TUC want is the reintroduction of Clause 99 but with the omission of the words &quot;falling short of obstruction of the highway&quot;.    Sucha provision would serve the original purpose of making it clear that therights of pickets are not confined merely to attendance.    It would not specifically deal with the question of obstruction but would, like the presentprovision on picketing in Section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour relations act 1974, remain silent on the overlap between the law on obstruction and immunities for pickets, allowing the police and the Courts a degree of discretion about whether and when picketing constitutes obstruction.5. It might be argued that the omission of the words &quot;falling short ofobstruction&quot; would have the effect of actually legalising obstruction in some form;  and I myself referred to this possibility during the debate on theRooker amendment.    However, on further reflection I consider thatdeletion of the words would not alter the likely interpretation of Section 15and Clause 99 taken together;  and I appreciate the tuc&apos;s concern that ifobstruction is  specifically mentioned, the law will be rigidified in a direction which neither they nor we would welcome.6. The Home Secretary has suggested that the best way of making progress would be for joint discussions to take place between the police and the TUC with a view to producing an agreed code of conduct on picketing.I have discussed this suggestion with the TUC.    They would be prepared toenter into discussions with the police only if Clause 99 is reinserted in theform they suggest; they do not regard discussions as an acceptablesubstitute for that.    Although I doubt whether it would be possible for thetwo sides to reach formal agreement on a code of conduct, the discussionsmight well result in a better understanding between them and this could be reflected in guidance which each might issue separately.    I am sure thatthis would be a helpful development and that we should do all we can toencourage it.    However, it is clear that so far as the TUC are concerneda new provision is a necessary pre-condition.THE LAW ON CONSPIRACY7.        Although less directly relevant to our Manifesto commitment, thisis a matter about which serious concern has been expressed by our own supporters and by the TUC following the Shrewsbury pickets case.    Onesuggestion which has been made is that Section 3 of the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act 1875, which deals with conspiracy in tradedisputes, should be amended to remove the sentencing anomaly which that case revealed.    An amendment intended to secure this was tabled by government supporters at the Commons Report Stage of the EmploymentProtection Bill but was not selected.2
8. In my view such an amendment would have much to commend it onmerit.    Under Section 3 as it stands, the prison sentence which may be imposed in trade dispute cases for conspiracy to commit a crime is limited to three months or to whatever longer period is laid down Li statute for punishment of the crime to which the conspiracy related;  but this limit is confined to crimes triable only on summary conviction,    I suggest thesection should be amended so that for all offences in trade dispute cases,regardless of how they may be tried, the sentence for conspiracy to commit the offence should not exceed the statutory limit for the offenceitself where one is prescribed.    This is a much less far-reaching proposalthan that put forward by the TUC, i, e. that the use of criminal conspiracycharges in trade dispute cases should be abolished altogether,9. I accept that major changes in the law on conspiracy should awaitconsideration of the Law Commission^ report, which I understand willbe available early next year.    But it would, in my view, be wrong not touse the opportunity afforded by the Employment Protection Bill to try tosecure this relatively minor change.    There are, of course, ampleprecedents for dealing separately in industrial relations legislation withthe trade dispute aspects of the law.CONCLUSION10.       I hope my colleagues will agree that in the light of our Manifestocommitment we ought not to leave the matter where it is but should do what we can to meet the views of our own supporters and of the TUC bytabling the amendments referred to in paragraphs 4 and 8.    I do notunderestimate the difficulty of carrying the amendments in the House ofLords;  but if we try and fail it will at least be clear that we have doneour best.M department of Employment25 September 19753
