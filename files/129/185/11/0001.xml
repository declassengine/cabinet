DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S government(75) 111 COPY NO3 November 1975CABINETEXTERNAL BORROWING policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, Our policy on external borrowing, which embraces the problem ofour sterling liabilities,, lies at the heart of our policies on externalfinance.2.        Historically a large proportion of our external borrowings has taken the form of sterling deposits and sterling holdings.    This was natural inthe days when sterling was a major reserve currency.    It also brought anumber of advantages, some of which still apply to a limited extent:-a. Originally it was the cheapest method of borrowing.    Thathas not been true more recently (see paragraph 3e. below).b. Because this is a fragmented method of borrowing, it doesnot focus attention on the amount and timing of our borrowing asdoes a large formal loan.    We benefit from the fact that the numerous separate deposits mask the total amount borrowed, as wellas the size of large borrowings from individual lenders, since thebanking system tends to diffuse the total taken in from any onelender.c. The convenience and informality of sterling depositsencourages a habit among lenders of using this mechanism forinvesting surplus funds.    Once deposited, the funds tend to remainhere through normal human inertia.    Until recently these tendencieshave proved very helpful in attracting some of the surplus of the oilproducers: in their case habit has reinforced the inclination to hedgetheir investment by placing some of it outside the USA.d. Finally banking, insurance, shipping and commodity dealingtends to be attracted to an active banking centre,3.        But I have for seme time held the view that these advantages are nowgreatly outweighed by the disadvantages of having so large a proportion ofour external liabilities expressed in sterling:-
e, Over the whole period since 1949 sterling borrowing has notbeen cheaper than,  Cy, dollar borrowing because, taking one year with another, the extra interest payable has offset the gain fromdepreciating sterling.    And during these periods when we did makea profit, the lenders concerned felt cheated,f, Moreover we have certainly lost overall as a result of the losses from the economic disruption which we have been forced toaccept in order to avoid a sudden massive conversion of our sterlingliabilities.    The threat of such a conversion has contributed greatly to successive stop-go policies and to our reputation for being proneto these policies,g. Our sterling borrowing causes parity instability because somuch of it is short-term.    The periodic threat of a massiveconversion has not arisen from the fear that we might default on our external debts, but from the fear that sterling might depreciatebecause the economies and currencies of certain other countries arenow becoming stronger and more important by comparison with ours.But a run on sterling caused merely by the fear of depreciationbecause of our relative economic weakness undermines confidence inus and creates fears that we may become uncreditworthy in absolute terms..h. Our policy on domestic interest rates cannot leave out of account the level of world interest rates.    But our sterling borrowingplaces a much more immediate constraint on our ability to operatedomestic interest policy flexibly and in accordance with our economic objectives.4.        But important though it is to reduce radically the proportion of ourliabilities expressed in sterling, we should not try to achieve this byguarantees of major sterling holdings.    These would in effect turn the guaranteed holdings into dollar liabilities, bat on the most unsatisfactory and expensive basis, because we would in practice be obliged to take on allthe exchange risks and pay high sterling interest rates as well,5,        We would therefore do much better, for the moment, to rely on thetwo existing deterrents to unsought large-scale conversion.    First, the sterling holders know that if they seek to convert large sums, they will cause the sterling parity to plummet or compel us to block their holdings.Second, conversion would deprive them of a major hedge against investingtheir funds in dollars.    I believe that for the time being they will not converton a massive scale out of fear of a marginal depreciation.    They will do soonly if our policies cause them to lose confidence in us to the point wherethey fear that we will default, or block their funds on our own initiative.
6,        In our present economic situation we are not attracting furthersterling deposits and are unlikely to do so on any scale.    The oil producershave now come to feel that their sterling hedge is sufficient for their purpose and are finding other hedges against the dollar.    So we shall haveto borrow in dollars to cover our current account deficit.    &quot;We are usingfor this purpose the method, now well-tried, of encouraging nationalised industries, local authorities, and private companies of good standing to borrow abroad.7.        If in addition to our current deficits we are faced with a deficit on capital account through the marginal conversion o  sterling holdings, then we ought to use our reserves to meet that deficit.    This would be the mainuse to which they would be put.    I have reluctantly come to the conclusionthat it would be unwise to use our reserves on a large scale to support the sterling parity, since they are quite inadequate to cope with a massiveconversion of sterling holdings.8.        Moreover, although our present economic weakness leaves us littleimmediate scope for reducing our sterling liabilities, we ought at least tomake it an object of policy to achieve such a reduction by means of an initiative on our part, so that when circumstances become more propitiousto such an initiative we are poised to take advantage of them.    We should stand ready, when the situation allows us to do so safely, to borrow moredollars than we need for our current account deficit and to use the excessdollars to replace some of the existing sterling deposits.    This switchwould involve, among other things, the management of the interest rate on.existing sterling deposits, and even in more favourable circumstances wouldrequire great care to avoid the risk that the holders of sterling deposits willconvert on a scale greater than we can accommodate.    What I have said ondollar borrowing will also apply where appropriate to opportunities forborrowing in other currencies and in special drawing rights.9.        I also recommend that we should try to devise a scheme which wouldtake advantage of London&apos;s status as a major multi-currency financialcentre in order to secure more non-sterling deposits.    Such a scheme would need to be entirely overt so as not to damage overseas confidence,I envisage an operation, superintended by the Bank of England, which wouldbe analogous in concept to the last major Euro-market loan but in which the funds would be raised in small amounts, and continuously, through the day-to-day working of the financial markets.    I envisage that foreign banks withbranches in the United Kingdom might take part in this operation as well asthe United Kingdom banks.    At present our banks borrow in dollars butmainly for on-lending abroad.    The proposed scheme would have to givebanks some inducement to retain non-sterling deposits in the United Kingdom,since there could be no question of compelling them to do so.    I recognisethat my proposal involves taking on short-term non-sterling liabilities.But sterling deposits, because of their immediate convertibility, are also ineffect a short-term non-sterling liability.    Non-sterling deposits, once
established, wo-sld only be subject to substantial changes in their flow on a major change in our credit rating, ie if a fundamental lack of confidence in britain were to emerge;  whereas sterling deposits have a much lowerboiling point, since depreciation in the exchange rate will make themvolatile.    What starts as a fear of an adverse parity exchange can quicklygrow into a sense of fundamental anxiety.10.       Lenders throughout the world are reluctant to invest all their funds in the United States.    At present Britain provides the essential alternativelocation, because only our financial mechanism is so highly developed as tobe capable of taking in money on the required scale.    The most certain wayof losing this great financial and political advantage is to bring our financial institutions into discredit through a collapse of sterling caused by an excessive dependence on our sterling liabilities.    We must therefore now make an early start in devising means of reducing that dependence andradically changing the mix of our external liabilities.    How rapidly we canimplement such a policy will depend largely on our success in restoring ourcredit in the eyes of overseas lenders.    But the essential preliminaryplanning should begin now.H LCabinet Office31 October 1975
