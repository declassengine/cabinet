DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government(75) 122 COPY NO       g \14 November 1975CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. Article 138(1) of the Treaty of Rome provides that, for what was envisaged as an interim period, &quot;the Assembly shall consist of delegateswho shall be designated by the respective Parliaments from among their members in accordance with the procedure laid down by each member state&quot;.    This is the system at present used.    Article 138(3) provides forthe introduction of a system of elections &quot;by direct universal suffrage inaccordance with a uniform procedure in all Member States&quot;.    The full text of Article 138 is attached at Annex A.DEVELOPMENTS UP TO DATE2. At the Heads of Government meeting in Paris on 9 and 20 December1974, seven of the Nine agreed, in the words of the Communique, &quot;that theelection of the European Assembly by universal suffrage, one of the objectives laid down in the Treaty, should be achieved as soon as possible.In this connection, they await with interest the proposals of the european assembly, on which they wish the Council to act in 1976.    On this assumption, elections by direct universal suffrage could take place at anytime in or after 1978&quot; (but see paragraph 8 below).    The Prime minister made it clear, as is also recorded in the Communique, that &quot;Her MajestyJsGovernment could not themselves take up a position on the proposal beforethe process of renegotiation had been completed and the results of renegotiation submitted to the British people&quot;.    The Danish Prime Ministeraleo reserved his position as to the date for the introduction of directelections.3.        The European Assembly duly produced proposals in January.   Asummary is attached at Annex B.    Heads of Government reverted to thisquestion at the European Council meeting in Brussels in July and foreign ministers were charged with examining the problem, taking account of theproposals put forward by the European Assembly and of other relevant factors.    (The Prime Minister made it clear that we would need to make
our own studies of the complex question involved).    In consequence,officials have been taking part in a Working Group set up for the purpose &quot;on the clear understanding that the Government has not yet taken up aposition on any of the issues under consideration.4. The Working Party has now reported;  a copy of its report isattached at Annex C.    It provides an analysis of the problem which need to be solved if a system of direct elections is to be introduced and in eachcase sets out various possible solutions.    The report contains norecommendations, though for some of the solutions proposed it gives an indication of the support shown for them, without specific nationalattribution.    One point is clear: there is general recognition that thedifficulties of reaching agreement between the Member States rule outdirect elections on a uniform electoral system at this stage of theCommunity^ development.    The consensus in the Working Group was thatas many questions as possible should be left to national decision, includingthe fundamental one of the electoral system to be used for each member state.5. On the question of the dual mandate (ie whether membership ofnational Parliaments should or should not be a prerequisite for membership of the European Assembly) there was a strong inclinationto leave the matter open to individual choice.    The Danes, however, arevery anxious to be able to retain a compulsory dual mandate in Denmark,We shall need to decide in due course whether anyone (including Membersof Parliament and Peers) can be dandidates, recognising the pressure ofthe dual mandate or. Members of Parliament (MPs),    The same issue will arise over the proposed Assemblies for Scotland and Wales - seeparagraph 12 below.6, Foreign Ministers had a brief discussion of the report on/6 November and have submitted it for consideration by the Heads ofGovernment in Rome on 1 and 2 December.TIMING OF DIRECT ELECTIONS7.        The aim of seven Governments is that elections should be held in1978.    But many detailed points will remain to be considered in theCommunity (and by national Administrations) even after the basic decisionsof principle have been taken by Heads of Government and the new arrangements will have to be embodied in a Treaty between the member states.    With the best will in the world, this is unlikely to be ready for signature before the end of next year.    It would then need to be ratified byall the Member States, a process taking up to a year.    In the United Kingdonand probably all other Member States, legislation would also be necessary toprovide for national systems of direct elections to the Assembly.    All told,there seems little possibility that the first direct elections could actuallytake place until 1979 or 1980.2
POWERS OF THE ASSEMBLY8. The powers of the Assembly are not under serious discussion atpresent, though some Member States profess to wish to increase them.The introduction of direct elections would give the Assembly - alwaysunderstandably anxious to increase its influence - additional arguments for wider powers and, in particular for some ability to influence theCouncil&apos;s decisions on legislation.    I am not in favour of yielding to pressure of this kind.    There is no question of the Member States agreeing to give the Assembly the last word in legislation and any arrangements for&quot;co-decision&quot; would risk creating conflict between the Council and theAssembly and thus hampering the Community&apos;s work.    But I do not thinkthat we can reasonably refuse to go along with the consensus in favour ofa step towards the Treaty commitment of uniform elections because of theadditional arguments that it will give the Assembly over powers, all themore because it will be time enough to decide how to meet these argumentswhen direct elections have taken place in four or five years&apos; time.Meanwhile, we shall be in a strong position for resisting any serious consideration being given to the possibility of greater powers,,    We canpoint out that the Assembly acquired certain new powers over the budgeton 1 January 1975 (slightly modified by agreement between the member states this summer, though the Treaty to this effect, signed in July, has yet to be ratified);  and that it would be wrong to divert attention from thecomplicated work on direct elections towards another unproductiveargument in the Community about greater powers,FUTURE POLICY9.        Against this background we now need to decide the line which thePrime Minister and I should take at the meeting of Heads of Governmenton 1 and 2 December.    I see no reason why we should let ourselves berushed into decisions.    It might suit us very well if, after hearing anyviews on matters of substance, the European Council were to note theprogress made in the Working Party&apos;s report in identifying issues whichwill need to be decided at Community level and to invite either the ItalianPrime Minister (as a Member State with a great interest in the subject,currently in the Chair) or M Tindemans (whose report on European union is due to be presented at the turn of the year) to make proposals whichcould form the basis for decisions by Heads of Government at the firstEuropean Council in 1976.    Given that the date the European Council setitself to take decisions was in fact 1976 and not 1975, such an outcomeought not to be regarded as excessively dilatory.10.       I suggest that we should also take this opportunity to give some firstthought to the main substantive issues which are likely to presentthemselves for decision in the Community.    In what follows I am assuming that the choice of electoral system will be left to Member States and thatthe dual mandate will be optional (see paragraphs 4 and 5 above).    On the3
electoral system, the most sensitive issue for us, given the obviouspolitical connection vith other important domestic issues such as theproposed regional assemblies for Scotland and Wales and pressures forelectoral reform, we will not need to take final decisions until much further down the road - not indeed until any new Treaty has been signedand ratified, unless we wish to settle the matter earlier for our own reasons,11.        The two main issues on which we are likely first to need to take aposition in the Community are:a. The size of the Assembly and the distribution of seatsThe Assembly at present consists of 198 members with 36 seatsfor the United Kingdom.    The balance of opinion in the community is in favour of an enlarged Assembly of some 300 to 400 members.Anything much bigger than this would be unwieldy and unjustifiablyexpensive.    But it is already clear that any reallocation of seatsmay give rise to considerable problems between the Member States.The French, while recognising that Luxembourg cannot be deprived of seats altogether, seek to make each countryJs membership asproportional as possible to its population and thus to increase the representation of the larger States.    The Irish want the same proportion of seats as they have in the existing Assembly.    Theother small Member States will wish to get at least the shareproposed by the Assembly.    The considerations as far as theUnited Kingdom is concerned are set out in a note by officials at annex D, which makes it clear that we will face problems over the adequate representation of the regions and minor parties.    A largerrepresentation would make these rather easier to deal with.    I think we should therefore go for an Assembly of about the sizerecommended by the Assembly itself (355) seats, with as many seatsas possible for the United Kingdom and preferably rather more thanthe 67 proposed by the Assembly.b. The election dayHere the basic choice is between having Community-wide electionson the same (or approximately the same) day or timing the elections in each Member State so as to coincide with national elections.Within the Community all except the Danes (who seem to feel stronglyabout this) favour the former.    The arguments on both sides from our own point of view are briefly set out in a note by officials at annex E,    On balance I think they point in favour of keepingCommunity elections separate from national elections.    On balanceI am in favour of a Community election day which is what most othermembers of the Community will favour.    We should explore further the possibility that Community elections might be held in May,. making it possible to combine them with our own local elections which takeplace in that month.4
12.        We have to consider at what point it would be right to consultParliament and parties.    I see no need to do so before the meeting on1 and 2 December.    On the contrary, if we have a clearer idea of thescope of the problems we should have a better prospect of leading the consultations so as to get constructive views on the questions involved.In doing so we shall have to bear in mind the point reached in discussions on devolution.    There is no reason why the arrangements for elections to the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies should cut across those which may ultimately be made for direct elections to the European Parliament.    Itcould be that issues of procedure and timing will arise as progresscontinues on the two separate matters; but we ought to be able to dealwith those at the time.    In respect of the European Assembly theimportant thing is that the fullest consultation should take place beforeHer Majesty&apos;s Government enters into any binding commitments.CONCLUSIONS13.       To sum up, my recommendations are as follows:a. At the Heads of Government meeting on 1 and 2 Decemberwe should work for a decision to invite the Italian Prime minister or M Tindemans to make proposals which could form the basis for decisions by Heads of Government in 1976.b. We should begin without commitment, to push things in thedirection indicated in paragraph 11 above on the two main substantiveissues likely to arise first in the Community discussions:i. the size of the Assembly and the distribution of seats;  an Assembly of about 350 with as many seats aspossible for the United Kingdom;ii. the election day;  a Community day, possibly timedto coincide with our local elections in May.c. That apart from the decisions required in 13b, we should workto ensure that all other arrangements, such as Electoral Roll,delimitation of Constituency boundaries, method of voting,conditions for canditature, etc. should be in the hands of nationalParliaments.d. There should be the fullest consultation of Parliament andthe parties after the Community^ preferred scheme has takenclearer shape, but before Her Majesty&apos;s Government takes onany binding commitments,L J foreign and Commonwealth Office13 November 19755
ANNEX AARTICLE 138*1.     The Assembly shall consist of delegates who shallbe designated by the respective Parliaments from amongtheir members in accordance with the procedure laiddown by each Member State.2.     The number of these delegates shall be as follows:Belgium ............................. 1UDenmark............................. 10Germany............................. 36France.............................. 36Ireland ............................. 10Italy............................... 36Luxembourg.......................... 6Netherlands......................... 1 kUnited Kingdom ...................... 363.     The Assembly shall draw up proposals for electionsby direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniformprocedure in all Member States.The Council shall, acting unanimously, lay down theappropriate provisions, which it shall recommend to member States for adoption in accordance with theirrespective constitutional requirements.* As amended by Article 10 of the adjusted Act of accession.
THE ASSEMBLY&apos;S DRAFT convention the proposals put forwaaei fey the Assembly at the beginningof this year (based on the Patijn Report) were in the form of adraft Convention.      The Assembly recognises the difficulty of going all the way to direct elections on a Community-wide uniformbasis in one step as Article 138(3) of the Rome Treaty envisages.It therefore proposes the repeal of Article 138(3) and theintroduction by May 1978 of elections to the Assembly to takeplace in each Member State on the basis of separate nationalprocedures but on the same date or on the immediately precedingor following day;    a uniform electoral system would be thesubject of further Assembly proposals to be submitted by 1980.The term of each Assembly would be five years.     The assembly would be increased from 198 to 355 members;    seats would be distributed as follows (existing distribution in brackets):Belgium	23	(14)Denmark	17	(10)Germany	71	(36)France	65	(36)Ireland	13	(10)Italy	66	(36)Luxembourg	6	( 6)Netherlands	27	(14)UK	67	(36)
Membership of the European Assembly would be compatible with that of a national Parliament (ie the so-called dualmandate would be neither made obligatory nor ruled out).     Onthe admission of political parties to the election,Parliamentary immunities and eligibility to stand for election,the Convention envisages that the provisions governing nationalelections should apply (though it would also be madeincompatible with Assembly membership to hold office in theCommunity institutions or in the Government of a Member State).The Convention does not deal with the right to vote in other member States, nor the question of compulsory voting.

Arrangements for electionsII. Composition of the European ParliamentIII. Status of members of the European ParliamentIV. Provisions relating to arrangements for implementing the future Convention and to its revision.oV    .     II.;:0 0EUROPEAN COMMUNITIESThe CouncilR/2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev. 1 dmCONFIDENTIAL
I. ARRANGEMENTS FOR ELECTIONSArticle 138(3) of the e.c. Treaty and the correspondingarticles of the ECSC and EURATOM Treaties lay down that:&quot;The Assembly shall draw up proposals for elections by direct universal suffrage in accordancewith a uniform procedure in all Member States.The Council shall, acting unanimously, lay down the appropriate provisions, which it shall recommend to Member States for adoption in accordance with theirrespective constitutional requirements.&quot;The draft Convention proposed by the Parliamentstipulates that &quot;pending the entry into force of uniformarrangements for elections, the arrangements shall fall within the competence of each Member State:&quot;The Working Party noted, that although completeuniformity would remain the ultimate aim, thetechnical and political difficulties were such thatuniformity in certain aspects only could be accepted as a transitional arrangement. :The delegations therefore felt that it would be wiser to proceed on the assumption that during an initial period the arrangements for elections would be governed by nationalprovisions in each Member State, subject to certain uniformrequirements ( ).( ) Cf. Pages 4-6
The Working Party considered that the concept of&quot;arrangements for elections&quot; covered not only the votingsystem (uninonrinal ballot, majority list or proportional representation) but also a whole range of provisions connectedwith those arrangements *   Thus, while the Working Party notedthat some difficulties might arise where the provisions adoptedby Member States differed too greatly, it still felt that national provisions should govern such matters as:- the voting age,- the right to vote, including that of nationals of one member State residing in another (^)r- eligibility for election ( ),- manner of voting (proxy vote or postal vote),- financing of elections,- legal obligation to vote, or not,- the size of the constituency or constituencies, up to the single national constituency.   One delegation suggested,however, that the draft Convention should include a provision whereby, in view of the need to;&apos;.bring the candidate into closer touch with his electors j a, single national constituencywould not be possible.   Other delegations could net accept this suggestion.( ) On this point see also p. 4 (banning of double voting).(2) As regards the possibility that a Member State might accept as meeting the conditions of eligibility that the candidatewas also a Member of the national parliament, see, in thisconnection, the problem of the dual mandate, p. 14.
- replacement of a member as a result, for example, ofincompatibility, voluntary or compulsory resignation, ordeath.   The arrangements currently in force in the member states provide for the replacement of a member:s: by a deputy= by the first person not elected from the list to which the member is to be replacedbelonged= through a by-election.It was pointed out, however, that common provisions should be introduced for the following three points:1, The banning of double voting, particularly in order toprevent nationals of one Member State who resided in another from voting in both States, when the lav; allowedthem to vote in either0   In this connection, reference wasmade to Article 11 of the draft Convention proposed by theEuropean Parliament in 1960, which stipulated:&quot;The nationals of one Member State who reside in theterritory of another Member State shall be able toexercise their right to vote in their country of origin, which shall take appropriate measures tothat end.Where the State of residence also allows the rightto vote to the persons referred to in the previoussubparagraph, since persons may vote only once.Any infringement of this rule shall be liable tothe legal penalties in force in the country of origin.&quot;
2, Offices with which the function of member is incompatibleIt was suggested that a distinction be made between two types of incompatibility:- that arising from national legislation.   Each Member state would be free to compile its own list,- &quot;Community incompatibility&quot; - this list should be agreed at Community level.The two lists would apply simultaneously.The Earopean Parliament suggested the following listfor Community incompatibility:- member of the Government of a Member State,- member of the Commission of the European Communities,- judge, advocate-general or registrar at the Court ofJustice of the European Communities,- member of the Court of Auditors of the European Communities,- member of the Consultative Committee of the European coal and Steel Community or member of the Economic and SocialCommittee of the European Economic Community and of theEuropean Atomic Energy Community,- member of committees or other bodies set up in pursuance ofthe Treaties establishing the European Coal and steel community, the European Economic Community and theEuropean Atomic Energy Community for the purpose of managing the Communities&apos; funds or carrying out a permanent and direct administrative task,
- 6 -- member of the Board of Directors or Management Committee,or staff, of the European Investment Bank,- active official or servant of the institutions of theEuropean Communities or of the specialized bodies attachedto them.Most delegations were able to agree to this list inprinciple.In view of the fact that the members of their governments might also be members of Parliament, severaldelegations wondered whether the Convention should include a provision stating that the duties of a member of aGovernment were incompatible with those of a member of theEuropean Parliament,,Other delegations said that they did wish this to belaid down, more especially since national GovernmentMinisters were members of the Council ,of the european communities.One delegation said that given the arrangements inforce in some States it would be more logical to accept as a compatible the functions of a member of the commission with these of a member of the Parliament, something which,for the moment, has not been sought.3. Timing of electionsUnder the draft Convention proposed by the european parliament, elections would take place on the same daythroughout the Member States. II.V2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev. 1 ner/JP/jm-000/ 000
- 7 -Two possibilities were envisaged by the V/orkingParty:(a) a single date, provided that this principle wasinterpreted flexibly and enabled the ballot to becompleted in a short space of time, so as to respectnational customs.It was said that there should be a provision to the effect that counting should begin immediatelyafter voting closed.As regards the publication of results, althoughit was emphasized that there should be provisionfor immediate publication, it was also stated that immediate publication was bound to influence the electoral behaviour of the nationals of the member state voting last ( ).(&quot;b) Same dates as for elections to national parliamentsThe following arguments were advanced for and against these two suggestions:1,  ^single^ateThe political significance and psychologicalimpact of European elections would be reinforcedif they were held on the same day in all member states.   This would also make it possible toorganize a real election campaign on Europeanissues.   Furthermore, each &quot;legislative period&quot;of the European Parliament would start and end atthe sa.me time for all members.   The political stability of the Parliament during such legislativeperiods would thus not be subject to seriousfluctuations.(&apos;) Where the single date applied, it would be desirableto agree the term for the length of mandate asMember of the Parliament.   The Parliament has.   suggested five years,R/2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev. 1 ner/JP/aeb .../.*.CONFIDENTIAL
Against this it was argued that political difficultiesnight arise if the composition of the European Parliamentdid not reflect the balance of political forces in thevarious Member States.There was also the risk, in the view of somedelegations, that because the work of the european parliament did not have a direct impact on the peopleof the Member States they might at first feel littlesense of involvement in the election of members and there might therefore be a low turnout if the election was heldon a different date from that of members to the nationalparliament.   Coversely, if the two elections were heldon the same day this would act as an incentive to vote,2 * SiJEe..Js   - 2 .. i e&apos;c tions to t^-e^S^tioS^^ES^JiSSBS^-S11^The same points were made in favour of this solution, namely:- the need to maintain a certain parallel between the composition of national parliaments and that of theEuropean Parliamentj- the need to ensure a large turnout.On the other hand, it was pointed&quot; out that if theelections to the European Parliament were spread over anumber of years, their political impact would be greatly reduced.Moreover, if the campaign for elections to theEuropean Parliament were coupled with the nationalelection campaign, there was a risk that it might be conducted mainly on national issues.   There would bethe further consequence that until elections had beenheld in all Member States, the European parliament would be composed of a mixture of elected and non-elected members, which would not be without problems *R/2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev, 1 ner/jP/aeb .../...
The objection was also made that if the dates werenot the same, it would mean that a fairly large numberof members would always be fighting election campaigns,which was bound to have an effect on the smoothfunctioning of the European Parliament.Finally, it was further emphasized that the resultsof elections in one or more Member States might influence the electoral behaviour of the nationals of other member states voting later.II. COMPOSITION OF TEE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT(A) Need for homogeneous basis for calculating the number ofmembersEmphasis was placed on the need for homogeneous dataso that the number of seats could be calculated on broadly similar demographic bases.   This could be achieved by using- the results of the most recent census carried out ineach Member State, provided that census methods were largely similar,- in the longer term, the results of the European censusscheduled to begin in 1981.
- 10 -(B) Number of seats(a) At present, pursuant to Article 138 of the e.c. treaty and the corresponding Articles of the other Treaties, thedistribution of seats is as follows:Belgium................ 14Denmark................ 10France ................. 36Germany................ 36Ireland ................ 10Italy................ 36Luxembourg............. 6Netherlands............ 14United Kingdom......... 36Total 198(b) The draft Convention drawn up by the european parliament provides for the following system:- up to a population of 1 million, each State receives6 seats;- States with a population between 1 million and2.5 million are given 6 further seats?- Uy to a population of 5 million, each State receives further seat for each additional 500,000 inhabitants,&apos;- For a population between 5-*nillion and 10 million each state receives 1 further seat for each additional750,000;- For a population between 10 million and 50 million each state receives 1 further se^t for each additional1 million inhabitants or part thereof;- Above 50 million, each State receives 1 further seat foreach additional 1,5 million inhabitants or part thereof.R/2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev. 1 ner/JP/ved .../...CONFIDENTIAL
- 11 -This system gives the following seat distribution:Belgium ........... i&apos; * *......* * * 2^Denmark.......................17France &amp;Germany ......... .............. 71Ireland ....................... ^italy ......................... 66Luxembourg .................***   6Netherlands ................... 27United Kingdom................ 67Total 355The Parliament arrived at this result on the basis ofthe following principles:- the guarantee of the maximum degree of proportionalitybetv/een a State&apos;s population and the number of its representatives in the European Assembly;- the representation of all significant political forces from within the Member State;- the prerequisite that in the ney/ dispensation of seats,no State would enjoy a lesser number of places than isat present the case.(c) For its part the group, made the following observations:1. As regards the total number of seats, this couldwell be in the size-order proposed by the Assembly.However, there remains the problem of whether the numbershould vary in accordance with population changes in the member States.
However, the problem arises of whether the numberadopted will be able to vary in accordance with populationchanges in the Member States.2. Three options were envisaged for the allocation of seats(i) to accept the system proposed by the EuropeanParliamentMost delegations said they could accept thissystem.Other delegations, however, said that thissystem did not provide a sufficient degree ofproportionality.(ii) To design another, more strictly proportional,method of distribution, whilst talcing account ofthe problem posed by the less populated States.(iii) To retain the present method of distributionThe present formula could either be retained&apos;unchanged or could be weighted using a co-efficient.This suggestion was rejected by some delegations.It was stressed by several delegations that thesolutions referred to in (i) and (ii) should not lead toa reduction in the number of seats at present allocated to each Member State.   Other delegations had reservations on thismatter.I&apos;
- 13 -One delegation stated that it would not he ableto accept a reduction in the present proportion ofthe total number of seats allocated to it.III. STATUS OF MEMBERS OP THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT(A) the dual mandateThere are three options:&quot; to prohibit the dual mandate- to make the national mandate compatible with theEuropean mandate- to make the dual mandate compulsory.While not denying the disadvantages which might result from the dual mandate, all delegations felt thatfor an initial period it should be possible to holda dual mandate so that the European member could maintain the closest possible links with both hisnational parliament and the citizens of his member state.   In the opinion of one delegation this argument justified making the dual mandate compulsory.Most delegations, however, felt that it should beoptional.One delegation, however, felt that if this possibility were retained each State would have a choice and some might therefore opt for the compulsory dual mandate, given the basic consideration that the eligibility conditions were to lie withinthe national competence.
- 14 -Several delegations, while not in favour of the compulsory dual mandate, said they could accept such aninterpretation as a transitional measure.   Other delegatiexpressed reservations on this,(B) ImmunitiesTwo questions arise in this connection:- would the immunities of European members apply only inthe Parliament&apos;s places of work or over the whole of community territory?- in addition to any immunities granted by the community to members of the European Parliament, would they alsoenjoy the immunities granted to members of nationalparliaments?Several delegations felt that the protection to beenjoyed by members of the European Parliament as a resultof the immunities conferred upon them should applythroughout the territory of the Community*There are problems of coherency between Article 10of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities and provisions of Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Draft1Convention prepared by the Assembly. ( )( ) On this matter, please refer to the note prepared by theCouncil&apos;s Legal Servxce Doc R/2364 (JUR 143) (ASS 570).
- 15 -(C) Verification of credentialsMost delegations considered that:- if any disputes arose concerning the internal provisionsgoverning the arrangements for elections in each member state, the competent national institution should dealwith them;- in the case of possible disputes concerning possibleCommunity provisions, one of the following solutionsmight be envisaged:s control by a Community institution (European parliament or Court of Justice of the European Communities).   Onedelegation said that this control should be theresponsibility of the European Parliament;= inasmuch as these provisions were of direct application,control could be left to the competent nationalauthority referred to, with the possibility of appealto the Court of Justice of the European Communitiesor to the European Parliament.(D) Loss of mandateThe Working Party noted that if a system was adoptedwhereby election of members of the European parliament would be governed by the provisions covering arrangementsfor elections in each Member State:
- 16 -- most of the provisions governing loss of a member&apos;s mandatwould be covered by such domestic provisions;- it was not impossible, however, for there to be Communityprovisions laying down some rules covering loss of mandateThe comment was made that the Parliament should in anycase be responsible for deciding on the removal of one ofits members from office- although if removal was a result of applying the internalprovisions of a Member State, the Parliament would have only to take formal note of the removal, which had beendecided upon by the competent national authority;- on the other hand, if removal was to be decided uponpursuant to possible Community provisions, it would befor the Parliament alone to take the decision.In regard to all the matters touched on at (B), (C) and(D) above, the Group thought these might well be the subjectof further study.
The following two -procedures were suggested;- the adoption of implementing measLires could bedecided on by the European Parliament on aproposal from the Commission; the Council,acting by qualified majority, could then eitheraccept or reject the Parliamentes decision (alonthe lines of the budgetary procedures),IV. PROVISIONS RELATING TO ARRANGEMENTS FOR implementing the FUTURE CONVENTION AND ITS REVISION(A) Arrangements for implementing the future convention on this matter, Article 14 of the draftConvention States&quot;Should reference be made to the procedure laiddown in this Article or should it appear that further measures are required to implement directelections to the European Parliament in accordancewith this Convention and if the necessary powers are not provided, the Council shall, actingunanimously on a proposal from the European parliament and with its approval, make the appropriateprovisions.   The Council shall consult theCommission before making its decision.&quot;(1) While most delegations could accept theprovisions proposed by the European parliament in Article 14 of its draft Convention, othersfelt that they were unacceptable, mainly becausethey provided for joint decision by Counciland Parliament.
- 18 -- implementing measures could be adopted by a proceduresimilar to the conciliation procedure adopted bythe European Parliament, the Council and theCommission for the preparation of acts havingfinancial implications ( ).(2) A number of delegations thought that the Article 14procedure could be used only for measures for implementing the Convention, in the narrow sense of the term.   However,they did admit that it might also be used for amending thenumber of seats when population changes made this necessary.Any amendments to the method of distributing seats, however,would come under the provisions for substantive revisionof the Convention.

- 19 -B. Revision of the ConventionArticle 15 of the draft Convention provides for the repeal of Article 21(3) of the ECSC Treaty, Article 138(3)of the e.c. Treaty, and Article 108(3) of the Euratom Treaty.The substance of these paragraphs is reproduced inArticle 7(1) of the draft Convention, which also sets adeadline (1980) for the European Parliament to draw up aproposal for a uniform set of arrangements for elections:&quot;The European Parliament shall draw up a proposal for a uniform electoral system by 1980 at the latest.   The council shall unanimously lay down the appropriate provisions, whichit shall recommend to the Member States for adoption inaccordance with their constitutional requirements.&quot;(1) Some delegations felt that it was possible tofollow the Parliament*s suggestion to repeal Article 21(3)of the ECSC Treaty, Article 138(3&quot;) of the e.c. Treaty, and article 108(3) of the Euratom Treaty and that there could therefore be a provision in the Convention coveringarrangements for possible revision.Several delegations thought that paragraph 3 ofthese articles of the Treaties could serve as a basis for any substantive revision of the Convention, and accordingly felt that- these paragraphs should not be repealed,R/2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev* 1 lisCONFIDENTIALo a ./ 00c
- the future Convention should not include the provisionsof Article 7 for revision of the Convention.However, one delegation raised the possibility that paragraph 3 of the aforementioned articles ought to apply only if the revision of the Convention were made for thepurpose of partially or totally establishing a uniformset of arrangements.   They therefore felt that:- paragraph 3 of those Articles should be retained,- there should be a provision allowing for a revision ofthe Convention which was not specifically aimed atsetting up such a uniform system ( ).(2) As regards the Parliament*s intention to prepare adraft for uniform arrangements for elections by 1980 atthe latest, some delegations thought that a date shouldbe set for the preparation of a Convention establishinguniform arrangements. They felt that the mention of sucha da.te would serve as a reminder of the objective whichhad been set in the Treaties and would provide an incentive to achieve this objective.Others thought that mention of a date would raisehopes which might subsequently be dashed, and accordinglyfelt that no such deadline should be set for drawing upthe uniform arrangements.( ) See the note drawn uo by the Legal Service /&quot;R/2325/75(OTJR 139)(ASS 562)^&apos;R/2547/1 e/75 (ASS 613) rev, 1 lis* Q -C/   * * *
Note &quot;by officials the SIZE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ALLOCATION OF SEATSAt present we have 36 seats out of a total of 198.     TheAssembly&apos;s proposals would give us 67 seats out of a total of 355*At ihe meeting of the Working Group on 18/19 September the Frenchjoined those who were in favour of enlargement (probably all the others, since even the Danes do not seem to be opposed).     However,they said on instructions that, while they recognised that seatscould not be allocated purely in accordance with population becauseof the problem of Luxembourg (and to a lesser extent of the othersmaller countries), the Assembly&apos;s proposals did not give sufficientweight to the importance of having seats proportional to the numberof voters:   there would be one seat for 60,000 people in Luxembourgcompared with one seat for nearly 900,000 people in the largercountries.     They agreed that the Assembly should have around 400seats but wanted more for the four, larger countries.     Most othermembers of the Group would prefer to accept the Assembly&apos;s proposals as to size (355) and allocation.     All are agreed that the Assemblymust not be made too large (ie more than about 500)*2.      The geographical distribution of our seats will be importantpolitically.     Attached is an example of how we might distribute ourallocation with 36, 67 or 100 seats.     The following points emerge:-With 36 seats(i)   Scotland would have four seats, compared with denmark^ 10 seats for roughly the same population.T
(ii)Northern Ireland would have one seat, comparedwith the Irish Republic&apos;s 10 seats for nearly double the population.(iii)Wales would have only two seats, although it hasabout the same population as the Irish Republic,(iv)   Throughout the United Kingdom the constituencieswould have huge electorates^     For example, inScotland the Strathclyde Region could have twoseats;   the other two Scottish seats would be shared by the rest of Scotland;   Birmingham, with over 700,000 electors, would not qualify for aseat on its own.     Typical constituencies would bethe whole of Essex, and the whole of Kent.With 67 seats the position would still not be good:-(i)   Scotland would have seven seats, compared with denmark&apos;s 17-(ii) - Northern Ireland would have two seats, comparedwith the Irish Republic&apos;s 13.(iii) Wales would have four,seats.(iv) The constituencies would still be very large,eg the metropolitan county of Merseyside wouldhave two seats.     No Welsh city would qualify for a seat.If we supported the French on proportionality, and perhapsargued for a slightly larger Assembly, we might get, say, 100 seats.The allocation to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ought then to come rather closer to that of the smaller member countries (whotight lose a seat or two).     Sample constituencies might be:-the Lothian region of Scotland, mid-Glamorgan, Sheffield.2
5.       The representation of minority parties could also raiseproblems.     Assuming that our normal electoral system were used,a rough calculation has been made on the basis of the number of seats won at the General Election of October 1974, with thefollowing very tentative results:-PartyAssumed number of U.K. seats,36 seats   67 seats   100 seatsActual results of UK_Election_Seats in   PercentageHouse of   of popularCommons voteLabourConservativeLiberalS.N.P.U.U.U.C.Others18161154291124943133318277131110o39.335.818.32.91.41.0This calculation almost certainly overstates the representation ofthe minority parties.     It simply distributes the seats in each.ofthe four countries of the United Kingdom in the same proportion asthe seats won in those countries by the different parties at theGeneral Election.     It therefore suppresses the extra squeezingeffect on the minority parties of combining numbers of constituencies-uencies.     In fact, with 67 seats it is questionable whether oneLiberal would have been returned.     Even with 100 seats, the liberals in particular would almost certainly do badly.     With an allocation in the Assembly of 67 or (even more) 100 seats, the SNPand UUUC might do rather better than the Liberals.

confidential annex   ENote by officialsELECTION DAY (COMMUNITY DAY OR NATIONAL ELECTION DAYS)Should elections to the Assembly be held at the same timer,Community-wide, at fixed intervals of, say, five years?     (No doubta uniformity requirement would be interpreted liberally so that vecould vote on Thursday and the French on Sunday.)     Or should enchcountry be free to decide the incidence of its own elections oo thatthey can be held, for instance   in conjunction with those to thenational Parliaments?2.     All the other Community countries, except Denmark, want a community day.     The main Danish reason for opposing this seems to&apos;be that it would make it more difficult for them to have a compulsorydual mandate, which they want in order to maintain close links between Copenhagen and Strasbourg.     The others, including theFrench, argue that the logic of direct elections-to the european assembly is that all its members should be elected at the nnmo timoand not when national elections dictate and for a fixed five-year period.     There are obviously strong Communautaire argumentn fora uniform date.3.     Domestically, the chief arguments in favour of holding theelections concurrently with our own General Elections are that thir-would be more economical, would be likely to result in a higherpoll, and would avoid the danger of political embarrassment to theGovernment of the day if the results were to favour the Opposition.More particularly:-1
CONFIDENTIALto mount an election on a national scale requires the mobilisation of large numbers of people to deal with arrangements for absent voting, to man the pollingstations, to conduct the count and so on;    it npvicosts approximately  5m.     With the elections heldconjointly a common infra-structure would be used,with relatively little additional cost, and that mostlyon the count or, perhaps, on the provision of extrapolling stations to relieve congestion likely to be caused by the delays of dual voting.There is a limit to the frequency with which the publiccan be called to the polls.     Separate elections arealready held for two different tiers of local governmentand for Westminster, and in Scotland and Wales there isnow also the prospect of elections to their own Assemblies.The low referendum turnout in Northern Ireland was thought to be symptomatic of just such a surfeit as could beproduced generally if separate elections to the european assembly were to be superimposed upon all else.Elections to the European Assembly taking place throughouton a single day would appear as a national verdictpronounced upon the Government itself, and the parties would be disposed to approach them in that way.     Localgovernment elections are already considered indicativeof public attitudes towards the Government of the day,and tfyese have at least cross-currents caused by localissues.2
4.     As against this:-(a) Significant additional cost could be avoided if the european assembly elections coincided with local government elections.     The risk of mid-term embarrassment to theGovernment could also be reduced.     Every year, in atleast part of the country, there are local government elections during the first week of May - a convenienttime, which might well commend itself to other community countries.(b) This synchronisation would also help to counter anyreluctance to go to the polls.5-     Apart from the Community arguments in favour of a uniformdate , there are the following arguments against holding assembly and General Elections concurrently:-(a) The political parties would pay scant attention to tlv;European elections and the latter could scarcely appnnras anything other than an extension of domestic politic?-;any European issues would be swamped in the election campaign.(b) Even though the detailed arrangements for the Assemblyelections are to be left to national arrangements ar.far as possible, the rules cannot be exactly the sarooas the rules for Parliamentary elections, eg oncandidates&apos; expenses.     These differences could increase over time, eg on the franchise.(c) Any under-representation of the minority parties (r.ooAnnex D) would be that much more stark if they got n3
reasonable number of seats in the accompanying GeneralElection.6.     If Ministers find the choice between a Community day and national days nicely balanced, they may wish to go along with thedecided preferences within the Community for a common electionday and to try to secure that the Community day falls in thefirst week in May.4
