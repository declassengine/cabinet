DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 12514 November 1975CABINETTHE RATE SUPPORT GRANT 1976-77Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. Controlling local authorities&apos; current expenditure has been one ofthe Governments most difficult problems.    The decision on the rate support Grant is critical for public expenditure strategy generally.2. The agreed figure for local authority current expenditures in 1976-77at November 1975 prices is  10, 260 million.    Pay and price increases (in line with the counter-inflation policy) would add a further  720 million,making total local authority expenditure next year  10, 980 million at1976-77 prices.3. The Treasury and the Department of the Environment ag,?3e that local rates, with no increases in average rate poundages should bring insome  3, 900 million, leaving  7, 080 million to be made up by the rate support Grant.4. A rate support grant of  7, 080 million would represent 64^ per cent of total local authorities&apos; current expenditure in 1976-77. The correspond-ing percentage for 1975-76 was 66^ per cent.5. The Secretary of State for the Environment argues (C(75) 123) thata reduction in the proportion of expenditure financed by the Rate support grant would create serious political difficulties, and could jeopardise therelations which the Government has been seeking to establish with the localauthorities with regard to control of expenditure.6. More specifically, he argues that local authorities will not fullysucceed in achieving a total standstill in current expenditure between1975-76 and 1976-77, and that local authorities will be gloomier about the inflation prospect than the Governments counter-inflation policy assumes.For both these reasons, they will in fact put up rates, even though on the strict arithmetic they should not need to do so,7. For these reasons, he recommends continuing with a percentage rateof grant of 66-^ per cent, even though this gives local authorities at least 200 million more than they need to finance their agreed expenditure.COPY NO81
8. The Chief Secretary argues, for the reasons set out in paragraph 1of the Annex to C(75) 124, that the Grant should be fixed at 64^ per cent.QUESTIONS FOR MINISTERS9. If the Chief Secretary1 s recommendations are accepted, ministers will be able to announce:-a. that local authorities&apos; current spending is being held constantin real terms;b. that this can be done without significant increases in the rate burden, and with a cut in the proportion of local expenditurefinanced by central Government.10.       Such an outcome if it could be made to stick, would represent a major success in the Governmenfs attempts to control public expenditure and, in particular, local authority spending.11.       If the Secretary of State for the Environments recommendations are accepted, the difficulties local authorities will have in keepingexpenditure constant will be cushioned, and the risks of significant increases in rates reduced.12.       On the other hand, to announce that the grant is being kept at66^- per cent, even though, on the arithmetic, local authorities do not needthat much money to finance their agreed programmes, could have damaging consequences:-a. It could create the impression that Ministers do not really meanwhat they say about public expenditure, and that they are tacitlyproviding money to cover slippage in both their expenditure policies and their counter-inflationary policies.b. Ministers have decided to seek major savings in public expenditure in 1978-79: the bigger the margin given to localauthorities now, the more difficult it will be - both practicallyand psychologically - to secure the desired savings in the medium term.RE C OMME agenda T ION13.       The CPRS recommends that Ministers endorse the chief secretary&apos;s recommendation.Cabinet Office14 November 1975
