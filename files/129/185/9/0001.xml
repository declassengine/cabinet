introduction. It is now some eight years since the last White Paper on the Aid Programme(Cmnd. 3180), other than the White Papers which publish the text of the annualU.K. Memorandum to the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation and Development. In this period there has beena marked evolution in the relationship between the industrialised world to which britain belongs and the developing countries of the Third world. Events in thelast year or two in particular have provoked an intense and wide ranging debate on the issues involved and a growing awareness of what interdependence means for the world economic community. H.M.G. has played a leading role in thedialogue on how a more balanced and equitable structure of international andeconomic relations can be created, and has accepted that the present relation-ship and balance between the rich and poor countries of the world must be remedied. Britain&apos;s aid programme constitutes a major channel of co-operationwith certain developing countries, and should be seen as one of a number of essential instruments for helping to make economic inter-dependence a reality.How best to achieve in present circumstances its objective of promoting theeconomic and social development of the people of the developing countries is the subject of this White Paper.2. While the developing countries as a group have made significant economic progress, a large number of them remain extremely poor and have fallen behind the others in their rate of development; furthermore, the poorest groups withinmost developing countries have benefited very little, if at all, from any improve-ment. The Commonwealth Heads of Governments, meeting in Jamaica inMay 1975, reaffirmed the statement included in the Commonwealth Declarationadopted in Singapore in 1971 that &quot;the wide disparities of wealth now existing between different sections of mankind are too great to be tolerated . . . our aimis their progressive removal&quot;, and endorsed the need for particular considerationto be given to the special needs of the poorest developing countries. They alsoendorsed the conclusion of the March 1975 Commonwealth Ministerial Meetingon Food Production and Rural Development that problems of rural develop-ment, affecting three-quarters of the population of Commonwealth developing countries, should receive high priority, particularly from aid donors.3. Also in May 1975, the Ministerial Council of the Organisation for economic Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.) recognised that manydeveloping countries were faced with extremely severe problems of poverty and decided that particular emphasis should be placed on meeting their requirements for assistance. This theme was also dominant in the Ministerial level meetingof the O.E.C.D. Development Assistance Committee in June. Also in June, theJoint Ministerial Committee of the World Bank and the International monetary fund recommended that priority be given to meeting the requirements of the poorest countries for concessional assistance and that the present distributionof aid be reviewed with a view to improving their share. These and similar1
considerations underlay much of the proceedings at the recent Special Sessionof the United Nations.4. There has thus been growing international agreement that scarce con-cessional aid resources ought to be concentrated increasingly on the poorest countries and used in ways which would directly benefit the poorest sectionsof the population in these countries. The problems of many of the poorest countries have been exacerbated by the sharp rises in oil prices and other com-modities, and the desperate situation of the poorest people in some of thesecountries has been highlighted by natural disasters, such as the droughts in ethiopia and the Sahel and the floods in Bangladesh.5. In this situation, we and other aid donors are now adapting our aidpolicies to give more help to the poorest countries and the poorest peoplewithin these countries. The purpose of this White Paper is to explain the back-ground to these changes, the problems involved and what we are doing to change the emphasis of our own development assistance policies. Some change hasalready been made; for example, earlier this year it was decided that future government to government aid commitments to the poorest developing countries should normally be made as grants rather than as loans. But because of the complexity of, and preparations required for, poverty orientated programmes,the overall change in emphasis in our policies will be a gradual process and itwill inevitably take some time for it to become fully effective; this new emphasiswill leave many of the traditional activities of our aid programme largelyunchanged.6. The White Paper does not go into the wider issues governing the overallsize of the total aid programmes; it is concerned solely with how we deploythe funds which are available. Moreover, while the criterion used in H.M.G.&apos;said policy is primarily that of need, the allocation of U.K. aid, like that ofother donors, is conditioned by a number of considerations reflecting ourwider interests and historical links. These will include political and commercialfactors. These wider considerations, whose significance will, of course, varywith time and circumstance, are not covered by this paper.7. In order to place this new approach in the context of overall British aidpolicy, and to help those who have little knowledge of the day-to-day workingof the Ministry of Overseas Development, there are annexes which describe the overall financial and policy framework, the main forms of British aid andthe organisation of the British aid machinery.2
OUR NEW AID POLICIES AND WHYLong-term perspective1. The improvement in the living standards of the vvorld&apos;s poor is one of the major challenges of our time; it will remain a challenge for at least the rest ofthis century and perhaps well into the next. In 1975 it is possible to look backover the last 25 years of national and international development efforts and to claim that much has been achieved. Developing countries have improved their basic infrastructure, railways, roads, bridges and power systems, and developed the skills of many of their people to provide the basis of higher levels of econ-omic activity. This has been assisted by technical assistance and financial aidprogrammes. Few developing countries had, in the past, a faster growth of their national output than they recorded in these years. Major progress has beenmade so that, for example, in the fifteen years since 1960 the aggregate gross national Product (G.N.P.) of developing countries, taken as a whole, more than doubled in real terms, rising on average by almost 6 per cent, per annum. Eventaking into account population growth, average income per head grew by some3 per cent, per annum. However, this overall picture conceals considerabledifferences between countries, and the poorest countries as a group haverecorded a much lower rate of growth (under 4 per cent.) over the same period.2. Despite what has been achieved, there is growing concern about the pattern of development in many of these countries. Most of them remain dualeconomies with a small, relatively prosperous, modern sector in the towns anda very large and very poor traditional sector living in the rural areas and around the edges of the towns. The rapid growth of population, without a matchingrate of development, has meant that a high proportion of the active populationof many such countries are either unemployed or employed in activities with very low productivity.3. The rapid growth of population in the developing world also gives rise to concern about its ability to feed itself. Rapid population growth is paradoxicallya result of great advances made in the last half century in medical science, publichealth techniques and efficiency of government organisations which have reduceddeath rates dramatically while birth rates have not been significantly affected.Projections suggest that the present population of the developing countries islikely to rise from 2.8 billion to 4.5 billion by the end of the century even on theassumption of an early and significant reduction in the birth rates in thesecountries. In a typical developing country, with its population likely to grow at\ per cent, per annum in the next 20 years and the need to raise living standardsfrom very low levels, growth of agricultural output will need to be a first priority for development policy.4. The purely physical factors suggest that it is possible to meet the foodneeds of the estimated population of the world for the next 30 to 40 years with-3
out resort to unconventional agricultural techniques. It must be emphasised,however, that there are enormous economic, social and political problems involved in increasing food production to these levels. In the developing coun-tries some stimulus may come from rising market prices, making agriculturalinvestment competitive with alternative commercial opportunities, and inter-national and bilateral agencies may help in promoting viable schemes by pre-investment studies and by the loan of skilled specialists. There will remain theproblem of providing the developing countries with the necessary capital for investment on the scale required.5. The response to these enormous long term problems must rest largely withthe developing countries themselves. They will have to devise and implement the policies which provide incentives and services to farmers to raise agriculturalyields and which allow them to absorb more of their large and growing labour force in productive labour-intensive activities. However, the poorest countries of the world cannot be left to shoulder these burdens without internationalassistance. They have depended, and must continue to depend, on research inthe richer countries to provide the advances in agricultural and industrialtechnology which will help their food and employment problems. They willcontinue to rely on the richer countries for the technical, professional andadministrative skills which they have not yet acquired themselves. Finally,although most developing countries always have financed, and will continue to finance, the bulk of their investment programmes from their own resources,many of them will continue to depend on an inflow of foreign finance to ensurethat they achieve adequate growth of their productive capacity to keep ahead of population growth and to achieve some improvement in average living standards in the next generation. This inflow has to be maintained over a long period oftime for the poorest developing countries, and for them the finance must be on very concessional terms. Because they start with such low average incomes, thepeople of these countries, who number more than a billion, have a long way togo to achieve a modest improvement and yet are ill-placed to make all thenecessary current sacrifice to ensure some improvement in future. It is moreoverthese same poor countries which are most vulnerable to major and sometimesrandom disturbances in the international economic system, as the events of thelast few years testify.Recent events6. The sharp rise in oil price has caused problems enough for us in Britainbut its effect has been even more serious for many developing countries, especi-ally as this coincided with bad harvests, a world-wide shortage of food and sharpincreases in the price of key manufactured goods such as fertilizers; so for manyof them the main problem has currently become not one of development butjust survival.7. Between 1972 and 1973 there was an improvement in the terms of tradeand the volume of exports of the developing countries taken as a group; many countries were able both to grow rapidly and to add substantially to their foreign exchange reserves. But by 1975 the rise in the prices of oil and foodtransformed world economic relationships. Coupled with the fall in the pricesof many of the developing countries&apos; commodity exports and dramatic rises in4
the prices of the industrial products they import, the increase in the prices of imported oil and food have quickly eroded the favourable position that someenjoyed at the end of 1973, so that virtually all developing countries who do notexport oil now face a severe deterioration in their terms of trade, not only corn-pared to the favourable levels of 1973, but also relative to the 1960s.8. To assess the significance of these recent events it is not enough to look atthe position of the developing countries taken as one group. To do so concealsthe great differences between them. Some have made substantial and probablycontinuing gains, some only temporary gains. But others, covering some 800million of the world&apos;s very poorest people, have not only been heavy net losersbut also cannot at present look to any better prospects ahead.9. Those countries with oil to export have become a class by themselves. Mostof them now have acquired a source of income, or a basis for commercialborrowing, which should mean that they will not need concessionary assistancein the foreseeable future. The richest oil exporters have acquired sufficient wealthto remove all financial constraints on their development, and they have funds to spare to help and invest in other developing countries.10. The non-oil exporting developing countries have faced a large and re-curring loss of income from the rise in the price of oil. For those who had previously done well this represents the end of the better times; their earliergains have been eroded. Tied as they are through their raw material exports tothe fortunes of the developed countries, some are worse off than they were before the commodity boom started in 1972. Nevertheless for these better offdeveloping countries the basic strength of their economies, reflected in theircreditworthiness and powers to borrow, gives them a resilience and adaptabilityto ride out the changes and still retain satisfactory longer term growth prospects provided the economies of the industrial countries begin to expand again atsomething like their previous rate of growth.The needs of the poorest countries11. It is the condition and prospects of most of the low income developing countries which have been most seriously affected. Often poor because of theirreliance on agricultural exports which do not benefit strongly from economic growth in industrial countries, they have not shared in the recent commodityboom. Instead they have seen large rises in the prices of their required importsof capital goods, raw materials, foods and fertilizer. At the same time droughts,floods and hurricanes have forced some of them to import much larger volumesof food grains merely in order to survive. The rise in oil prices alone has involved the most seriously affected countries in very large annual costs and will continueto do so for some years ahead, while their terms of trade have deterioratedseriously, not only from 1973 but also compared to the late 1960s. This groupincludes the large South Asian countries and a number of smaller countries,mainly in Africa; virtually all of them have an income per capita of less than$200 (or about  90) per annum. Between them they account for nearly one-thirdof the world&apos;s population. Before the recent dramatic economic changes, theywere already very poor and growing much more slowly than other better offdeveloping countries their average standard of living rising barely 1 per cent,per annum and many of them have been receiving far less aid per person from5
all sources than the rest of the developing world. Recent events have put backtheir already modest growth prospects.Financial implications12. While the recent emergency has provided some stimulus to action, it isthe longer run prospects which must determine the shape of the response. Theprospects for the middle and higher income developing countries in the longer period depend heavily on the growth of their exports, and this is particularlysensitive to the level of economic activity achieved by the industrial countrieswhen they emerge from the current recession. They will also have to rely more on commercial sources of finance than in the past. In this context, the inter-intermediary role of both private and official institutions and the direct role of mem-bers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (O.P.E.C.) will bevery significant. If effective demand world wide for traded goods is to be main-tained, the role of the O.P.E.C. countries in putting more of their financial sur-pluses into active use will be crucial. When the developed countries recover fromthe present recession, and if the developing countries can attract and managefinancial flows on largely commercial terms, then the majority of them withper capita incomes over $200 should achieve modest rates of economic growth.13. But the prospects for the poorest countries (roughly those with incomesunder $200 a head) are bleak. Unlike the better off developing countries, theycannot attract or afford to borrow substantial quantities of money at commercialrates; private institutions would not regard them as being creditworthy and anysubstantial borrowing from public institutions at anything other than highlyconcessionary rates would build up intractable debt problems. While longer termforecasts are very uncertain, calculations suggest that if the present level of oilprices continue, if the industrial countries grow more slowly than in the past,and if the present volume and distribution of aid is maintained, the averageliving standards of the countries with per capita incomes under $200 would only slightly improve between now and 1980. Even if the industrial countriesresume their past growth rates, the living standards in the poorest countries arestill unlikely to improve by more than about 1 per cent, each year. If thesecountries are to achieve a growth rate of over 2 per cent, per capita, which wouldthen approach that of the better off developing countries, then they would needsignificantly larger annual amounts of aid up to 1980 than is expected to flow in1975. To achieve this in the absence of a substantial increase in the total volumeof official development assistance will require a significant redistribution of aidflows towards the poorest countries.14. Much of the increase in aid flow could come from the new rich, the oilproducers, although the bulk of total aid will have to continue to come from theold rich countries, since the combined national income of the new oil rich states will be only about 5 per cent, of that of the traditional O.E.C.D. aid donors.The financial surpluses of the oil producers provide a new source of capital on commercial terms which, if channelled directly or indirectly to developing countries, would in theory be an important stimulus to the world developmentprocess. But concessionary funds will remain a scarce resource to be husbandedwith particular care in the new world situation; it is more important than ever to ensure that they are placed to produce the greatest effect.
15. Some international financial facilities have been mounted which help with the short and medium term balance of payments problems of developing countries (see Chapter VIII for details), but these must not distract attention from the need for all donors to maintain and increase concessional aid flows inthe long term to the poorest countries. The long standing divergence of pros-pects between the poorest developing countries on the one hand and the middle and higher income developing countries on the other, has been sharpened by recent upheavals. It has always been true that the poorer a country the furtherit has to go in raising the standard of living of its population. But the poorer a country the harder it is for it to save domestic income or to service commercialfunds borrowed from abroad, in order to raise its investment rate and future growth prospects. This is still the case, and after the recent changes the prospectsahead are even bleaker for the poorer countries than they were before. Themiddle and higher income developing countries will need to rely more on flowsof commercial capital. In the current state of world capital markets it is not easy to raise long term capital, and the development of new institutions by thericher oil producing countries for long term investment in developing countries and the expansion of existing international institutions, such as the Inter-national Bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.), will inthelongerterm assist the flow of resources to developing countries.U.K. aid policy poverty orientation16. In these circumstances, it is essential that we, the U.K., play our full partin adapting our aid policies to meet the needs of the poorest countries. Our newaid strategy is therefore in essence:(a) to give an increasing emphasis in our bilateral aid towards the poorest countries, especially those in this group most seriously affected by therise in the price of oil and other commodities. (Ways of achieving this are discussed in the next chapter); and(b) to promote situations in which British concessional aid funds canstimulate matching contributions of concessional funds from othergovernments, and to encourage the deployment of such aid through bothmultilateral and bilateral channels towards the poorest countries. (Thisis discussed further in Chapters VIII and IX.)17. It is not enough to concentrate concessional aid on the poorest countriesif the main purpose of such aid is to give more help to the poorest people of theworld. It is true that most of the poorest people in the world live in the poorest countries and that allocating more aid to these countries might therefore beexpected to benefit the poorest people. But there is no guarantee that this will always happen unless conscious action is taken.18. In the last few years there has been a growing realisation that the benefits of the significant improvement in the overall economic position of manydeveloping countries has not always helped the poorest groups within thesecountries. Attention has already been drawn to the emergence of dual economies in which the benefits of development have tended to be concentrated on the modern sector and many left outside it have not gained productive employment.Millions of people still live in conditions of absolute poverty, often without eventhe basic needs of food and shelter. Disease, malnutrition, ignorance, apathyand persistent under-employment are the normal lot of these communities. the
poorest, feeling the need for mutual family support and particularly support inold age, still tend to have large families despite (or partly because of) the high rates of infant mortality.19. When the plight of these people is highlighted by the publicity accompany-ing natural disasters, such as the floods in Bangladesh or the drought in theSahel, there is always a ready response to appeals for some short term relief.Such assistance (which is the subject of Chapter VII) is essential and saves manylives. But the emergency provision of food, shelter and medicine relieves onlythe most obvious symptoms of poverty. It does not deal with the root causes.And no one and no country wants to depend on charity. Instead the incomes ofthe poorest groups need to be increased by opportunities for productive work.Nor is it sensible simply to rely on measures to reduce birth rates, though thatis vitally important. Experts all over the world are now fairly certain thatpopulation growth will be reduced only when general economic conditionsimprove and infant mortality is reduced, so that parents no longer feel the need to give birth to many children to ensure that at least a few survive. Policies for family planning have their place (they are discussed in Chapter V), but, if theyare to be effective for the mass of the people, it must be in the context of widerpolicies of economic and social development.20. A widespread current view among analysts of the development process isthat, unless specific action is taken to assist the poorest groups directly, relativepoverty will increase and any reduction in the number of people living in a stateof absolute poverty will be painfully slow.21. The Government accepts that more should be done to ensure that ahigher proportion of British aid should directly benefit not only the poorest countries but the poorest people in those countries. As most of these people live in rural areas, the third leg of our new aid strategy is not only to put a newemphasis on programmes orientated towards the relief of poverty withincountries but to give a special emphasis to rural development. There are how-ever many problems. Those generally related to poverty oriented programmingare discussed in Chapter III; the more specific problems of rural development are discussed in Chapter IV.8
ALLOCATING U.K. AID BETWEEN countries. Even when it is decided, as the Government has decided, that there shouldbe an increasing emphasis on aid to the poorest countries, there are still manypractical problems to be resolved. There is first that of deciding which countries are indeed the poorest and have the worst prospects; this is not just a question ofrelative poverty, and even that is not easy to establish. One has to take intoaccount the amount of aid each country is likely to receive from other donors,including multilateral agencies, and whether any individual country is likely tohave such a flow of foreign exchange from other sources, e.g. oil and mineralexports, as to make it unlikely that further injections of concessional aid would affect its rate of development in the near future.(a) The assessment of relative poverty2. Any allocation of aid aimed at helping the poorest must begin with someassessment of the relative poverty of individual countries. The starting pointmust be the national income of each country and the size of its population.Although population figures are relatively reliable, it must be recognised that national income figures have many limitations. These limitations apply even when using the figures for analysis within individual countries, but there areadditional reservations when they are used for international comparisons. (Themain difficulties arise from the exchange rate to be used for converting national income expressed in national currency into a common currency, and the differences between countries as regards patterns of production, consumption and price levels.) Despite the limitations, however, there are no readily availablebetter alternatives, so we must continue to use them. If and when currentinternational research into these problems (research which is being partlyfinanced by the U.K.), produces better measures, we would be ready to consider their use in this important context. Further, as the effect of concessional aidlasts well into the future, it is necessary to take a view not merely on present levels of incomes but on future levels also; growth rates vary, and if there is to bean increasing emphasis on help for the poorest, aid should tend to concentrate onlow income countries with worse growth prospects than the average.(b) Aid from other donors3. In seeking to determine a country distribution of aid based on need, wehave to take into account the country pattern of aid from other donors, includingthe oil producers. Given the limited total volume of concessional funds available and the various criteria used for determining distribution, concessional aid canbe badly distributed in relation to need. The best way of avoiding this wouldbe for some international agreement on appropriate criteria for determining thecountry distribution of aid (as we have suggested to the Development assistance committee), and then joint action for achieving that pattern. If aid were totallymultilateral, achieving an acceptable distribution of total aid would, in theory,9
be easier than with the present mix of bilateral and multilateral programmes.But no individual donor, even one following mainly development or povertycriteria in distributing funds, feels that it should attempt to counteract all thebiases, as they exist and emerge, in the pattern of other donors&apos; aid. In this sense the role of the &quot;residual donor&quot; is understandably sought by no one. Butif individual donors, in planning their distribution largely on the basis of need,increasingly take account of the aid given by other donors, then the more quicklywill an optimum overall distribution eventually emerge.4. The U.K. is moving towards this position. We are not necessarily reducing our long standing allocations to the poorer countries as a result of other donorscoming forward to make funds available. But in poor countries where we havea relatively small programme or no programme at all, we shall consider increas-ing or instituting an aid programme only if that country is, and is likely toremain, relatively &quot;under-aided&quot;.(c) Funds from other sources5. In deciding on the distribution of our own concessional funds, it is only right that we should take notice of situations where countries which wouldqualify on poverty grounds for our aid are already receiving as much by way of export income as they can use for their own development. In general, thesecountries are the major low income oil and mineral exporters. Each case has tobe looked at individually, but where it seems likely that as well as having anenergetic development programme a country will still, by virtue of its export earnings, be increasing its foreign exchange reserves, then the case for Britishfinancial aid is substantially reduced. Giving aid to a country in such circum-stances would merely be adding to its reserves. This does not mean that theeconomic development programmes of countries such as these are no longer amatter of concern to the U.K.; it is rather that the nature of our involvementmust change, with increasing emphasis on technical assistance, where in somecases it is right that the recipient government should contribute to the cost.(d) Absorptive capacity and performance criteria6. It is often suggested that the ability and willingness of a country to make effective use of aid funds should be a significant factor affecting aid distribution.This raises the difficult issues of the relevance of absorptive capacity and itsmeaning, as well as the question of &quot;performance criteria&quot; and the objectivesagainst which performance is to be judged. Absorptive capacity is a major factorto be considered in any economic assessment of a developing country and, where this constraint on development exists, aid will be used to help to ease it, inparticular by providing more technical assistance to identify, formulate andimplement projects and programmes. Experience with using &quot;performancecriteria&quot; of a purely statistical kind suggests that these need to be approachedwith great caution, as it is often difficult to distinguish efforts from success; thelatter may be a result of good luck while great efforts can be met with littleapparent success because of the deep-seated nature of the development con-straints.7. The Government will continue to be actively concerned in ensuring thatconcessional funds made available are used to finance projects and activities10
which produce real and substantial benefits. We do not, however, approach thiswithin narrow financial or even solely economic terms. The judgment of whetherthe benefits from particular kinds of activities are sufficiently great to justifythem is usually best made by the governments of individual countries, thoughwhen aid funds are directly involved the donor has the right and obligation tomake his own judgment. In those instances where benefits are difficult to measure,we expect expenditures to be justified on the basis of careful studies of sectorobjectives and, in particular, their relation to the amelioration of poverty and an appraisal showing the least cost method of achieving such objectives.(e) Balance of payments8. In general, a difficult balance of payments situation facing a country should not automatically determine whether it is in need of concessional aid.Such difficulties can result from deliberate decisions by the governments of developing countries on the running of their economies, or from the excessiveuse of commercial credits, and it is very doubtful whether in these circumstancesmore aid is justified. Poverty remains the overriding criterion and poor balanceof payments prospects are important if they indicate continuing low per capitaincome in the future. A relatively richer developing country should not qualify for concessional aid merely because of poor balance of payments prospects.The governments of richer developing countries have more scope to correctany balance of payments problem by changes in domestic policy.(f) Historical factors and wider considerations9. Most aid programmes are partly and inevitably a reflection of the past.A high proportion of British bilateral aid has always gone, and will continue togo, to fellow Commonwealth countries; in 1973 British bilateral aid to such countries amounted to  183 million; this was 82 per cent, of total Britishbilateral aid. Moreover, within the Commonwealth, Britain has a special responsibility for the Dependent Territories and the West Indian AssociatedStates, whose reasonable needs have been, and will continue to be, a first charge on our aid resources. Of the Commonwealth total of British bilateralaid in 1974,  22 million (or 12 per cent.) went to the Dependencies and Si million (or 5 per cent.) went to the Associated States.10. In addition to these historical connections, other political and commercialfactors are taken into account, though against the background that the funda-mental purpose of the aid programme is to promote development and therelief of poverty.(g) The terms of our aid11. It is our policy to relate the terms of our bilateral aid to the economic circumstances of the recipient country, and for a number of years the majorityof our bilateral development loans have been provided on interest-free terms.However, in the middle of 1975 it was decided that aid terms should be softenedeven further for the poorest developing countries, and our government togovernment aid commitments to those with a per capita income of less than$200 are now made on grant terms, unless a country&apos;s income prospects are such as to make this an inappropriate concession. These very poor countries are also eligible to compete with British firms for the supply of goodsfinanced from our remaining bilateral development loans, provided thecountry receiving a loan so agrees.11
12. Our bilateral aid is normally tied to the purchase of British goods and services in the U.K., but exceptionally we are prepared to untie a limited part to meet the local costs of British aid financed projects. We are also prepared toallow the purchase of certain categories of goods from third countries whereexceptional circumstances justify this, particularly if the recipient country is aDependent Territory. Our contributions to multilateral institutions such as theWorld Bank are provided on an untied basis, in comformity with an agreement reached by member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of theO.E.C.D.12
THE PROBLEMS OF ENSURING THAT BRITISH AID DIRECTLYBENEFITS THE POOREST SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY1. Although we intend to give a new emphasis in our aid programmes to aidwhich directly benefits the poorest sections of the community this is easier saidthan done. This chapter discusses some of the principal considerations beginning with the most important of all the attitudes and policies of the recipientgovernment.The importance of the attitudes and policies of recipient governments2. The scope for action by donors is clearly limited. It is the attitudes and policies of the governments of the developing countries that are decisive. Theresponsibility for dealing with poverty, unemployment and income distributionis plainly theirs these are indeed highly sensitive matters at the heart of theinternal political process in all countries both developed and developing. Andthe character of the political, social and economic power structure in each country conditions the power of governments to ensure a more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth.3. Most, if not all, developing country governments have declared their intention of raising the standards of the mass of the population. But even when this objective has been most earnestly and consistently pursued there is inevitablyoften a gap between such stated goals and actual performance.Allocation of aid to particular sectors, types of projects and regions withindeveloping countries4. It is sometimes argued that a direct method for trying to ensure that aidis used to benefit the poorest section of the community is for the donor to specifyin advance the economic or social sectors, types of projects, geographical areas,or particular beneficiary groups within a country to which it wishes to confine,or preclude the use of, its aid. Such a policy faces obvious difficulties. It mightwell be offensive to national pride and resisted by many recipient countries andnot only those unsympathetic to the objectives which the donor is trying topromote. This raises the real possibility that on the conditions specified a potential recipient would prefer to refuse the aid. Such a policy might also be frustrated if the recipient government was able to offset it by switching its own resources from one sector to another. Finally, there would still be the difficultyof an official outside donor being able without local co-operation to specifyenough individual projects where the benefits of aid would in fact go largely tothe poorest group. Where the recipient government is generally sympathetic tothe objectives, outside help in specifying sectors and groups will be needed only if, for whatever reason (e.g. domestic pressures or lack of expertise), the recipientgovernment feels unable on its own initiative to devote enough resources to dealing with the poverty and employment problems. For these various reasonswe do not propose to follow this kind of approach.13
5. Rather we believe it is essential that a poverty focussed aid policy has tobe related to the circumstances of each individual country and that one has toproceed by means of detailed programmes related carefully to the circumstances and wishes of each country and not by way of general guidelines to be appliedregardless of all countries. Obviously the most successful efforts could be madein countries whose governments see the need for and are trying to implementpolicies and programmes directly affecting poverty, employment and income distribution. By promoting and supporting conferences such as the Common-wealth Ministerial Meeting on Food Production and Rural Development, weare discussing with developing country governments the support that they would wish us to give on projects which will directly help the poorest sections of theircommunities.6. It may nevertheless be helpful to say something about the types of projects and programmes which might emerge after consultation on a detailed country-by-country approach. In many developing countries the groups containing the absolute poor are likely to be small peasant farmers, landless rural labourers,the urban unemployed and those doing low productivity jobs in the urban area.There is no doubt that in particular cases a poverty orientated aid programme will involve aid for the urban sector and this is discussed in Chapter V. but since most of the poorest people in the developing countries live in rural areas, itseems inevitable that for most countries and particularly the poorest the mainattack on poverty for some long time ahead must be in the rural areas. This, ifsuccessful, should help to cut down the flow into the urban areas. In thesecircumstances, it is likely that where developing countries ask us to help themwith their poverty orientated programmes, their requests will mainly concernrural development. This is the subject of the next chapter.7. A change in emphasis in British aid policies along these lines will requiremore work by British officials in co-operation with recipient governments inproject identification, formulation and implementation. This will place an extraburden on the staff and particularly on those with expertise in the new areas of concentration such as rural development. The role of O.D.M. staff servingoverseas such as in the development divisions (described in Annex III) is also likely to increase since these are the people who are likely to be most closelyinvolved with recipient governments in the initial identification, selection and preperation of suitable projects.The problems of local costs and recurrent expenditure. Most of the money provided to finance aid projects is usually limited to theimport costs of the project. But aid programmes designed specifically to help the poorest sections of the community are likely to involve a high proportionof projects where most of the money involved has to be spent on local wages andlocal materials and equipment.9. We are ready to consider allowing in exceptional cases a limited part of our financial aid to meet local costs of individual projects. We take account of anumber of factors. The most important is the developmental case. This will in turn depend on such things as the availability to the recipient country of dom-estic resources and free foreign exchange, and the efforts made to improve the mobilisation of those resources.14
10. It is also likely that many projects aimed at helping the poorest sectionsof the community will involve recurrent costs; for example a rural development scheme might well involve agricultural extension services which might be needed for many years if the project is to be successful. Most donors, includingourselves, while being reasonably generous in providing local costs for povertyorientated programmes in the poorest countries, are normally unwilling toprovide local costs to cover recurrent expenditure. This is often regarded as anon-productive form of aid which leads to &apos;open-ended&apos; commitments andwhich reduces the incentive for increasing the mobilisation of local resources tomeet such costs.11. While most of these views have considerable validity there are cir-cumstances in some of the poorest countries where projects likely to benefit the poorest will not be undertaken unless the donor can provide reasonably generouslocal costs.15
RURAL development . The term rural development which has recently become so fashionablecovers many activities which are not in themselves novel. The working definitionwe are at present using is &quot;the improvement of living conditions in rural areasthrough the increased productivity of agricultural and related enterprises and,if it is to benefit lower income groups, the equitable and fair distribution of the wealth so created taking into account the need to maintain a balance between individual consumption, investment and improvements in communal social services&quot;. We see integrated rural development another term much used atpresent, which in our view reflects a more widespread awareness of the manyinterdependent aspects of rural life in developing countries as referring to a balanced and co-ordinated approach which seeks to take into account the variedneeds and circumstances of a particular area. Such definitions will inevitably haveto be modified and refined as we gain more experience of operating a policywhich deliberately seeks to place high priority on rural development.2. At the heart of successful rural development is increased agricultural production. In most environments this is probably based primarily on annualcrops, dairy products and animal husbandry or fisheries, which largely feed the rural populations themselves. But rural development must also involve thegeneration of cash surpluses, whether through cash crops including timber andother forests products or through the marketing of the surplus staple foodcrops. This not only gives the rural population a cash income. It also providesboth local resources and foreign exchange earnings to contribute to the develop-ment of the social and other services which are an essential part of the full development of the rural areas. Thus the marketing of surplus staple food cropsor the growth of crops for export and industrial use can also be associated withfood crop production and, under suitable conditions, can on their own be thebasis for further rural development.3. Some basic services are a pre-condition of rural development. These may include agricultural extension, rural roads, water control, credit facilities,marketing systems, elementary education and rural health services. But every country and indeed each region within a country will have a unique combination of its own existing natural resources development, and other facilities, servicesand inputs as well as different social systems and political approaches. Thereare therefore no prescribed solutions for implementing and operating a rural development policy; it is essential for both donor and recipient to tailor each individual project to the often widely different needs and circumstances of thearea or region involved. Moreover, in any given situation only some of thecomponents can be provided and supported from outside and these can only be identified in consultation with the authorities responsible for directing the enterprise.16
4. Our assistance can take differing forms and can be directed to a variety ofpurposes. There can be a need for financial assistance or for technical assistance,or for a combination of both. We can become involved in a fully integratedarea development or operation, or simply in one particular element of the pack-age, the rest of which might be within the capacity of the local government concerned either with or without assistance by other aid agencies, with whom we should be ready to collaborate to the extent necessary. But whatever the size and scope of our involvement we must be prepared to maintain our inputfor a long enough period to achieve our objectives. We shall be ready to beflexible in our approach and to keep our procedures under review.5. Finally, it is important to recognise that no self-sustaining development canbe expected if there is not an active commitment of the administration of thecountry at all levels, as well as of the people themselves. The management of aidfinanced projects must therefore from the start include as many qualified localpeople as possible, preferably from the local area. Where the use of foreign staff is unavoidable, local personnel must from the beginning be trained to take over their places as soon as possible. There is of course nothing new in this approachsince it applies to almost all aid projects. But it is of particular significance in rural development projects. The national government must naturally also beready to provide the necessary local resources for success in terms of bothfinance and manpower, as well as full recognition and acceptance of the part which external aid can play.More employment as well as more food6. A most important aspect of rural development if it is to benefit the poorestis that it will need to be done in ways which minimise the displacement of labour.Thus the double challenge of rural development is to raise productivity and income in agriculture while at the same time providing work for more people inthe sector.7. There is an important difference between concentrating on increasedagricultural production per se and increased agricultural production through the medium of rural development. The latter should involve an improvementof the standard of life of the broad mass of the rural population. Though somegreater inequalities in income may well emerge, depending partly on whether thegovernment and people favour individual smallholdings or estate development or a mixture, projects and programmes should be designed to ensure as far aspossible that the employment and incomes of the poorest groups grow at an acceptable rate without undue sacrifice in the growth of production.8. Within the rural sector, therefore, one might expect greater emphasis onprojects designed to benefit the rural poor such as the poor small farmers andlandless labourers. This may require less emphasis on costly, large scale schemes,costly that is in relation to the number of people affected by them. Moreoverbecause capital is so scarce it is more than ever necessary to find the least costmeans of achieving particular objectives.What have we done already?9. The amount of rural development supported by British aid is already quiteconsiderable. It has included projects in marketing and processing, rural17
transport infrastructure, irrigation, electrification, agricultural extension,health, population, loan and credit programmes, land reform, integrated areadevelopment and settlement. These projects have been possible because the U.K.was able to provide expert management, feasibility studies, research, technical and specialist manpower, besides capital aid.10. A classification by economic sector of our commitments and disburse-ments of bilateral financial aid and technical assistance is presented annually in&quot;British Aid Statistics&quot;1. This classification, whilst useful in some respects,does not give an accurate picture of our efforts to give assistance in the field of rural development. For example, road projects are naturally classified as&quot;transport and communications&quot; though many of them are an essential in-gredient of rural development. The same applies to some health and education projects.11. We are developing a new classification of our expenditure which will,it is hoped, give a more realistic picture of the impact of our assistance on the rural areas. This involves indentifying the location and purpose of individual projects as precisely as possible and devising a method of enabling this inform-ation to be collected in a consistent fashion. In spite of the considerable technical and conceptual problems it is hoped to produce a report based on this newclassification before the end of the year.How much more can we do?12. The scope and speed with which we can increase our rural development programmes will largely depend on the wishes of the recipient governments. Wecannot, and do not desire to, impose our rural development policies on countriesin the developing world. The immense variety of cultures, physical resources andgovernmental machinery in the developing world demand a variety ofresponses in terms of aid. Our assistance must therefore be identified and organised country by country.13. Nevertheless, in seeking to pursue more energetically an emphasis onrural development in our own aid programme, we realise that we may find our desire to assist in the rural sector does not accord with the wishes of a recipientgovernment. And other relevant factors (for example, political or commercialarguments) have to be given their proper weight. But while recognising that weare largely dependent on requests we receive from governments, we intend to devote increasing efforts to those enterprises where we are invited to share in apurposeful drive to raise living standards. In fact we hope that a growing inter-national concensus on priorities, such as we think was evident at the 1975Commonwealth Ministerial Meeting on Food Production and Rural Develop-ment, and our willingness to assist particularly in the process of identifyingand formulating suitable projects will lead to our being asked to co-operate with more and more projects in this sector.14. The process of indentifying, formulating, initiating and implementingrural development projects is likely to take longer than most other forms ofassistance, for a variety of reasons: the intrinsic complexity of rural situations,our own desire to make more deliberate and appropriate contributions, and^British Aid Statistics 1969-1973&quot;: H.M.S.O. 1974.18
manpower constraints both in our own administration and that of the recipientcountry. Its implementation will therefore need to be realistically related toachievable rates of expenditure.15. Improved projects and assistance to rural development will undoubtedlyrequire more intensive and more protracted research, planning and appraisal,and this is likely to put new calls on both our internal and external sources ofexpertise. Nowhere more than in agricultural/rural sector planning is close collaboration between indigenous developing country staff and external person-nel essential. We are likely to see more experimental or pilot programmes as a prelude to any more extended schemes.16. We accept therefore that it will take time for our new policy emphasis tobe reflected in the composition of our aid programme. This is one of the main reasons that we consider we should take a more active role by making clear our desire and willingness to strengthen our contribution to rural development, andby seeking our new opportunities for projects both bilaterally and in co-operationwith multilateral agencies.The steps we are taking17. As a first step we have informed Commonwealth Governments, andwill be informing other recipients of our aid, that we wish to help them promoterural development and food production through our aid programmes. Wehave established within the O.D.M. a new Rural Development Department,which will co-operate with the Departments concerned with particular countries so that we can achieve a much more positive promotion of rural development. Alongside this Department, which will also have a special con-cern with integrated development schemes, we have set up a Steering group on Rural Development which brings together within O.D.M. its many sources of specialist advice and the operational geographical administrators. Wehave also been strengthening our interdisciplinary Natural Resources AdvisoryGroup of scientists and specialists in the rural field.18. We are considering how our technical assistance and our trainingprogrammes might best be adapted to meet the emphasis on rural development and food production. As a step in this direction we have set up at ReadingUniversity the Agricultural Extension and Rural Development Centre whichoffers post-graduate training to those officials of middle management status and upwards who plan and administer rural development programmes.19. On the research side O.D.M. has supported a joint Overseas Develop-ment Institute (O.D.I.) and Reading University research programme onchange in agriculture. The wide-ranging results of this research were discussed at an international Seminar held at Reading University in September 1974.Consideration is now being given to further work in this field and a new initiative involving O.D.I. which will assist in the dissemination of research in rural development to policy makers and managers and more closely involvethe social scientist in the development process.20. Other important research on rural development is being undertaken by many other institutions in this country such as the Institute of DevelopmentStudies and we intend to encourage and foster such research, particularly19
when it is likely to be closely related to the formulation of new projects and programmes in this field.21. In addition to longer term research and the careful and often necessarilyslow preparation of appropriate projects and programmes, the way ahead in rural development will also depend on some bold innovative projects whichwill depend on creating and quickly responding to suitable opportunities as and when they appear. Such projects are often small and local and are bestundertaken by the voluntary agencies which, with their greater flexibility,can respond quickly to needs. To enable them to play their full part a new scheme has been recently announced whereby the Ministry will pay half the costs of certain agreed individual projects and, particularly, innovative projectsundertaken by voluntary agencies. Many of these projects will contribute to improving conditions for the poorest groups of people in developing countries.22. There have also been recent discussions between the commonwealth development Corporation (C.D.C.) and the O.D.M., as a result of which theC.D.C. has decided that over the next five years it will increasingly seek toplace its new commitments into the poorer countries and into renewablenatural resource projects that is to say, in agriculture, forestry and fisheries,benefiting people living in the rural areas.23. Finally, we have been discussing with international agencies whetherthey know of suitable projects to which we could contribute. We have also made it clear that we are ready to support and to play our part in any inter-national initiatives which seem likely to serve a useful purpose in providing additional funds for rural development, co-ordinate the activities of variousdonors in this field and ensure a more effective use of available resources.
POLICIES IN THE OTHER MAIN SECTORS1. Poverty oriented programmes call for action in sectors other than theagricultural. Indeed it may not be easy to secure the co-operation of the people in the necessary development of agriculture unless they can see and themselvesexperience benefit to themselves and their communities in these other sectors.They will look for social benefits: they need them in any case. This chapterlooks at the necessity for and the problems of changing our policies in some ofthese other sectors.EDUCATION2. The context in which aid to education is given has changed and continuesto change. It began when there was little state-provided education in the developing world, and such education as there was often provided by missions and other voluntary agencies. It grew under the Colonial Development and welfare Acts and after the war a lot of help was given to the development ofeducation at primary and, more especially, secondary and tertiary levels usuallywith the motive, stated or not, of producing a corps of civil servants and other leaders in society who would be able to take over from expatriates who had inmany cases provided the backbone of the administrative machinery. Universitiesflourished; more than 30 overseas universities owe most of their origins toBritish assistance.3. There then developed a demand for universal primary education. But inpractice appropriate basic education for all or often the majority of children has rarely been achieved because of the lack of adequate resources and also because of the pressure to meet the demands for movement upwards throughthe secondary schools into the universities. The expansion of education has not always produced the economic and social benefits expected. Its effects have been more to determine who should enjoy the benefits. The new education systemshave greatly favoured urban populations and the children of middle and upperincome groups.4. Education expansion has also imposed large financial strains and often been accompanied by poor (and sometimes declining) quality and efficiency.The lesson is being learned that if all members of the population, and particularly those in the rural areas, are to enjoy at least some basic education, then thegrowth of education has to be related to development needs, and efficiencyimproved.5. But governments naturally regard education policy as something whichthey themselves develop in relation to the needs of their own countries as they see them. The education of the poorer sections of the community, whatever agethey may be, is a matter which governments wish to regulate according to theirown policies. They are sensitive about advice from without but they are readyto receive expert external advice and assistance for the implementation of
their own plans in circumstances in which donors are bound to listen moreand to prescribe less.6. The emphasis in aid therefore is changing to the provision of expertisewhich can contribute in this context. In any event what aid can be providedcan only be at the fringe of the overall development of education whetheruniversal or in particular countries; nevertheless a ship may be turned with avery small helm. We recognise that we have to be selective about those areas ofeducation which we can most effectively aid and where a modest input will havea far-reaching effect; we can bring assistance to the development and reform ofcurricula, to the development of local examinations geared to local needs, tothe employment of diverse media in education, and especially tape, film andradio, to the provision of books and, in a large number of countries still, theprovision of teachers and more importantly teacher trainers where there is a&quot;multiplier effect&quot; of aid. In co-operation with the British Council we cansupport the diffusion and the improvement of the teaching of English as aninternational language but there is a need to learn how things can be taughtin vernacular languages where this is feasible in local circumstances. We canadvise on ways of developing the structure of education and the management and inspection of school systems. But it is not possible to have a universal solution to the various educational problems of the increasingly varied developing world and we have to do what we can where we can in a way which carries forwardeducation with the greatest developmental advantage.7. Much thought has been given in recent years to &quot;basic education&quot; and&quot;non-formal education&quot;, concepts which are capable of application in diversecircumstances. We must beware of adopting policies which while intended tomeet the needs of the poorest people, and especially those in rural communities,imply that poorer people and people living in the country can expect only a standard of education lower than those who happen to live in towns. There is a need for education about education.8. As a beginning however it is possible in basic education to aim for exampleat: functional literacy and numeracy; the knowledge and skills required for raising a family and running a household; the knowledge and skills for earninga living in the community within which a person works while also giving him abasis for advancement into wider areas in either his own country or elsewhereif he seeks the opportunity; the knowledge and skills required for participation in the community and its government.9. Little has in practice been done on these lines but H.M.G. is ready to help the development of basic education, particularly in rural areas, by pilot projects and small scale schemes or on a larger scale if these are acceptable to thegovernments concerned. We are prepared to join in experiments with the estab-lishment of rural Community Schools for both children and adults, for thepupils to be of all ages well outside the pattern of leaving school at 16 oruniversity in the early 20&apos;s; to facilitate the provision of education whereverthere is a desire for it and to help in its awakening where there is not; to inte-grate where possible developments in education with those in other aspects of rural transformation, for education cannot be seen in isolation. The role ofwomen will be crucial. The major constraints will be the identification ofsuitable situations where an external contribution can properly be made and the
recruitment and training of staff in the U.K. who will be qualified to participate in non-traditional education activities.10. We have also to foster in co-operation with the Technical education and Training Organisation for Overseas Countries (T.E.T.O.C.) the teaching and development of appropriate technical skills, in colleges, institutions andpolytechnics as well as in job training schemes: and to find means as basiceducation develops of teaching these skills outside the towns, in &quot;learningcentres&quot; in the villages, through village level workers and by radio, corre-spondence and even by television when this is appropriate and practicable. we need to encourage the use of the education facilities for as much of the day andevening as possible: there is too much to be done for expensive buildings to beunused for most of the 24 hours.11. It is on the whole in the richer countries that education on the threeformal levels has been the most developed but the poorest countries will requirethe skills necessary for administration and international relations in an in-increasingly complicated world. We shall therefore continue to support educationat all levels and especially in the least developed countries. They too need access to universities and polytechnics. We will continue to reconsider with the Inter-University Council die role of universities in development and rural development in particular. We expect our provision of education aid to the more advancedcountries to begin to taper off and everywhere we shall give more careful con-sideration to the question of who benefits and who pays for the education beingsupported.12. We shall continue to offer training and further education in this countryfor those who require it and for whom the appropriate facilities are not available or cannot be economically provided nearer home. We may have to concentratecourses or training or research at particular &quot;centres of excellence&quot; rather thanpicking up courses where they can be found and we are ready to encouragesuch centres overseas rather than always in Britain. We will continue to reviewour processes of recruiting British staff and, where necessary, of training them so that we are better able to meet the calls for assistance in increasingly special-ised fields as the general provision of classroom teachers is gradually run down.13. There is still much to be done in the provision of books and literatureand perhaps more importantly in the production in the developing countriesthemselves of indigenous teaching materials. We are ready to explore how this can best be carried further forward.HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT(a) The problem14. The housing needs of the poorest sections of the community in developing countries are by any standards immense. Generally speaking in rural areas the availability of land and traditional building materials, and self-help methods of construction, mean that modestly adequate shelter can fairly readily be obtained for a family. In urban areas, however, it is a much more difficult problem, andrelates not only to housing but to the wide range of services such as sewerage,piped water, domestic electricity supply and street lighting which tend to beequated with urban living.
15. The particular problems of the poorest countries are, first, the competingdemands from the rural sector for the limited financial resources available for development and improvement; these rural sector requirements must berecognised and met as, in Africa and most of Asia, the majority of the popu-lation and most of the poorest people live outside cities and towns. Second, the consequential severe limitations on the finance for new investments in urban areas and for meeting the recurrent cost of urban services and administration.Third, the low incomes of a substantial proportion of the urban inhabitants,despite the fact that in several respects the majority of town dwellers could beconsidered better off than most rural inhabitants, since they are generallyprovided with more readily available social services and civic amenities and jobopportunities and wages are better. Fourth, in the poorer developing countries there is the unique difficulty that the incomes of the majority of urban residentsare &quot;low&quot; in an absolute sense in relation to the cost of conventional approaches to the supply of urban services. The traditional approach to establishingminimum acceptable standards and to methods of construction place a par-ticular constraint on the poorest income groups obtaining adequate shelter.The cost of providing and maintaining conventional housing, urban watersupply, sewerage, electricity, transport facilities, roads, and even the cost ofsite and service schemes are all high in relation not only to the low incomes ofthe urban poor but also in relation to the level of income of the majority of the urban population. Nonetheless if the poorer areas of the cities where the greatestnumber of urban citizens live are not to become completely untenable centres of disease and misery, then some if not all of the services are essential, bearing inmind the obvious differences between rural and urban life. Clearly, however,traditional and conventional approaches to their provision will have to be modified so that the benefit of urban amenities can be shared more justlybetween all sections of the urban community.16. Financial resources are completely inadequate for the purpose of resolvingby traditional and conventional methods the housing needs, as well as many ofthe other urban requirements of the poor countries. &quot;Low-cost&quot; housingschemes have occasionally been included in development programmes but while,relatively, the capital cost of building the houses has been low they fail to benefit the poorest groups in the community because their incomes cannotreach up to even these costs. The result is that so-called low-cost housing usuallyserves middle-income groups rather than the poor. If any immediate impact isto be made on a reasonably equitable basis in reaching the poorest income groupsthen we believe that the answer lies in adopting a combination of &quot;site and services&quot; schemes, and improvement and upgrading of existing informal&quot;squatter settlements&quot;.(b) A possible solution site and services schemes17. Planned schemes initiated within the public sector and providing minimumservices from which individual initiatives can develop offer a practical contribu-tion to solving the problem of housing the poor. A &quot;site and services&quot; approachminimises labour costs, first, by ensuring that participants in each schemecontribute their own labour to the construction of housing, and second, bypermitting construction standards determined by the resources, skills andinitiatives of individual families, provided necessary standards of health and
safety essential in the interests of the whole community are maintained (although these need not be such as to impose major constraints on the poorer families).18. Schemes can range from the provision of land with defined boundarieswithin which people can build their own houses (subject to minimum standards),to the provision of floor slabs, service cores and possibly a single room whichcan be expanded as and when the opportunity occurs. The less government hasto put into each scheme (although it will have to put in a basic contribution) thelarger will be the number of people who will benefit from the limited resources;the more each household puts in the more the households that will benefit.19. Schemes probably require:(i) an area accessible to centres of employment, shops and social services;(ii) the provision of land with security of tenure for lawful occupiers;(iii) a properly planned physical lay-out of the area, establishing boundariesfor individual plots and space for roads, social infrastructure and amenities;(iv) minimum water, electricity and sewerage facilities;(v) credit facilities for the purchase of basic building materials and their supply at minimum cost through co-operatives or central buyingagencies;(vi) guidance in the construction of housing which owners can expand as timeand resources permit;(vii) community guidance (e.g. the social worker who would help to resolvedomestic and community problems and who would liaise betweennewcomers and urban authorities);(viii) a level of charges for the basic facilities provided, such as to enable eachscheme to be self-financing and in due course to generate surpluses withwhich to help start other similar schemes.As many as possible of these elements are needed to get such schemes going.(c) The action we propose to take20. Housing is a subject of prime concern to local governments and politiciansand the adoption and implementation of schemes on these lines will beessentially a matter for decision by the governments in individual developing countries. However we propose to inform them that we will be glad to considerassisting them with their housing problems in respect of low-income groupsthrough the medium of &quot;site and service&quot; schemes in one or more of thefollowing ways:(i) by providing advice under technical assistance, at national or locallevels (although the amount of expertise which we can offer in this fieldis limited);(ii) by financing pilot schemes in selected areas (viz. where there is sufficient support, both local and central, to indicate a reasonable chance of long-term effective schemes being undertaken); and(iii) by providing financial aid for definitive schemes in appropriate cases.21. Where funds for a particular country are limited, we would restrict our assistance to pilot schemes likely to generate further local interest. Capital aidwould have to be restricted relative to the total need but it will usually have toinclude some provision for local costs.
POPULATION22. Attempts to improve the living standards of the poorest sections of thecommunity are obviously made more difficult if the population of these com-munities is increasing rapidly, as it is in most of the poorest countries. Becauseof this, aid for population matters must be given high priority. A substantial proportion of our effort is in support of multilateral and international aidprogrammes. In 1974/75 Britain contributed  1.7 million to the U.N. Fund forPopulation Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation, andin 1975/76 we shall contribute  3 million to these organisations. At the sametime we are developing a bilateral programme of aid in this field.23. Population growth is not restricted simply by providing family planningservices. The lesson that has been learned over the past few years is that the fullimpact of such services cannot be made without community participation. Thismeans the direction of greater resources to development strategies that providethe poor with jobs, education and health care as well as with family planningservices. Indeed there seems to be a direct association between levels of social and material well-being and declines in fertility. The raising of living standards and personal economic security now appear to be necessary pre-requisites of a successful family planning programme. This implies attention to:(a) measures to reduce disease and mortality among infants and young children. In turn this helps to decrease the desire by couples for large families in order to &quot;replace&quot; children who are expected to die. such measures go alongside improved nutrition, especially for children;(b) the provision of family planning services and information as an integral part of maternal and child health care services. This approach relatesfamily planning to the need to improve the general health and welfare ofmothers and children and enables couples freely and responsibly todecide on the number and spacing of their children in the light of the health and welfare and resources of the family and of the community inwhich they live. For family planning to become a normal part of com-munity health care more community health centres and clinics are neededrather than large scale hospital services and the utilisation of para-medicalas well as medical staff so that much larger sections of the population canbe reached by these services. Unless these services are provided now,measures taken to reduce disease and death rates of infants and young children will initially lead to a substantial increase in population growth;(c) the provision and improvement of social and welfare services in general,particularly for the aged. If parents know that in their old age they willbe taken care of by the wider community, they are less likely to wantmore children in order to ensure security in old age;(d) increased research into the cultural background into which family planning services are introduced and studies of the most culturallyappropriate methods of family planning and fertility regulation inparticular situations. This implies increasing the research capacity in developing countries;(e) measures aimed at improving the status of women in society, and theinvolvement of women in the development process. The improvement ofthe status of women (particularly educational status), and their involvementin productive roles outside the family, has been shown to have a complex
relationship with changes in fertility patterns which can lead to smallerfamilies and new aspirations which help to defer childbearing.24. In negotiating our bilateral programmes we shall try to take factors suchas these into account. It is clear that different aspects of both rural and urban development and population programmes are closely interwoven and this -enforces the need for a multi-disciplinary approach.HEALTH25. The poorest developing countries have serious health problems becausethey are mainly situated in tropical areas, where disease is widespread and food supplies inadequate or of the wrong kind. Many of the diseases found in the poorer countries are directly caused by malnutrition, like kwashiorkor, or indirectly like certain forms of anaemia. In addition many non-tropical diseasessuch as tuberculosis, measles and pneumonia often have more serious effectsamong the poorest people in developing countries than they do in Europe orNorth America. In this situation, particular attention needs to be paid to publichealth, nutrition, water supplies and other measures to prevent disease.26. In the past much of Britain&apos;s health and medical aid has taken the formof responses to requests from developing countries, whether for training or forspecialist services, buildings and equipment. We now wish to give more emphasisto the needs of the poorest sections of the community and to the development ofsystems capable of serving all sections of the community. Until recently a large part of British aid for medical and health facilities in developing countries wasto meet requests for new hospitals, particularly teaching hospitals, or theexpansion of established ones. Now British medical aid is being increasinglydevoted to community health and preventative health schemes in rural areas,rather than to large hospitals and specialist curative services. For example,capital aid has assisted in the provision of rural health clinics in Lesotho, theGambia and Kenya.27. This change of emphasis is also reflected in the current strategy for researchfunded by O.D.M. in the field of tropical medicine. For example, specialemphasis is now placed on research into preventative measures and the develop-ment of cheap and simple methods of treatment, with the object of achieving thehighest possible level of community health through methods appropriate to theconditions where the mass of people live. Similar changes are taking place inour training programmes.
THE SPECIAL PROBLEM OF WORLD FOOD AND FERTILISERS1. Whatever is done by means of rural development schemes or urban development schemes to help improve the living standards of the poorest, andnotwithstanding the importance of suitable policies for adequate and suitablehousing, education and health schemes, the basic need is sufficient andadequately nutritious food.2. It is necessary to distinguish between the immediate world food problem and the longer term prospects. The present world food crisis is essentially theresult of bad harvests caused by unusual and widespread adverse climate conditions at a time when world food stocks were unusually low. As a result the price of food has increased rapidly. This coincided with the sharp rise in oilprices and also in key manufactured goods such as fertilisers. The poorest foodimporting countries found it more and more difficult to provide and pay forthe food that their people required.3. Cereal prices have this year fallen below their peak levels, but futureprice levels are bound to be significantly affected by the increase in production costs which have occurred, as well as by increasing world demand. Because ofthe rapidly growing populations in the poorest countries who need to importfood, and the great need to increase their nutritional levels, their demand for food will also continue rapidly to increase. Most of this increased need will haveto be met from domestic production within these countries. This means that although in the short term the main emphasis for those giving outside assistancemust be on food aid, the focus of attention in both the short and longerterms must be on increased agricultural production in these countries and theresources needed for this.(a) Help with food production4. In the light of this analysis it has been decided that the main aim of Britishdevelopment assistance policy in relation to the food needs of developing countries must be to support them in efforts to maximise local food productionand provide for its equitable distribution.5. There are three main areas of action. The first is research, to create more productive agricultural technologies, to adapt the package to specific ecologiesand societies and extend the resultant processes and ensure availability of inputsto farming communities. We are giving full support to the Consultative group on International Agricultural Research, sponsored by I.B.R.D., F.A.O. andU.N.D.P., which for 1975 has succeeded in assembling the $45 million requiredto sustain the eight existing international centres, of which perhaps the bestknown are the Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre in Mexico and theInternational Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. The Group has alsosponsored the establishment of the International Board for Plant GeneticResources located in Rome, which has amongst its functions the task of pre-
serving genetic resources in danger of extinction. In addition to our directsupport to these scientific power-houses, we finance complementary co-operative work in British establishments and assist developing countriesbilaterally to equip themselves to utilise the output of the international system.6. The second area of action is through the multilateral agencies concernedwith agricultural investment, of which the most important is the international development Association, with its expanding programme of concessionallending for rural development. Regional development banks also have an increasing role to play. To supplement these resources the World Food Confer-ence advocated the establishment under United Nations auspices of an Inter-national Fund for Agricultural Development and the General Assembly hasinvited the Secretary General to explore the possibility of creating such a fund.He is holding preparatory meetings in which the U.K. is playing a very active part. We hope the Fund will attract additional resources on a sustainable basis and if it does we shall certainly contribute. The World Food Conference also proposed the establishment of a Consultative Group on Food Production and investment in Developing Countries (C.G.F.P.I.), whose main function is toencourage a larger flow of external resources for food production and theimprovement of co-ordination and effective use of available resources. We were represented at the first meeting of the Group held in Washington in July 1975.7. The third area of action relates to our direct bilateral assistance to the developing countries. By our new rural development programmes described in chapter IV we hope we can help to provide the incentives to the farmer tosurpass the target of feeding himself and his family and bring sustenance to hisneighbour in town and country and even further, by harnessing the natural andhuman resources of the countryside, making a growing contribution to theagricultural export earnings of his nation.(b) Fertiliser aid8. One of the key factors in increasing food production is the provision ofsuitable fertiliser. Lately however there have been world shortages of the rawmaterials used in their manufacture; there has also been a halt to new investmentbecause manufacturers found in the late 1960s that supply was much exceedingdemand. Demand for fertiliser recovered rapidly during the 1972/73 food crisis,and then shortages of supplies, both in the home market and for export, develop-ed. At the same time, fertiliser plants in some developing countries were operatingat a low percentage of capacity, often through lack of adequate power supplies.The rapid rise in oil prices contributed to the escalation of prices, and the response to these increases has been a cutback in fertiliser consumption. While there arenow indications of some surplus manufacturing capacity, current estimatessuggest that supplies of nitrogenous fertiliser will remain below underlyingdemand until about 1978.9. In 1974 the F.A.O. Council established the International FertiliserSupply Scheme to monitor the demand and supply situation, with special reference to the most seriously affected countries, and to facilitate the im-ports of those countries, from the resources made available to the Scheme.The importance of that Scheme has been emphasised by the World food conference and by more recent international meetings. Despite the effects
of the scheme, of increased bilateral fertiliser aid, and of recent falls inprices, many developing countries could still not afford to buy the fertiliserthey required. The consequential loss of production in those countries duringthe fertiliser year ending 30 June 1975 is estimated at 2.7 million tons of grain. Some countries will experience similar difficulties in the current year.10. Because we import much of the raw material for our fertiliser manu-facture, there are limits to what we in Britain can do to meet the fertiliser needsof other countries. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom has already supplied25,000 tons through the F.A.O. scheme, as well as 146,000 tons to Indiaand 10,000 tons to Bangladesh on a bilateral basis. We have recentlypromised to give another 100,000 tons, in association with the F.A.O.Scheme, during this year. We are also anxious to help developing countriescreate or improve their own sources of fertiliser supply as part of our longer term aid to food production. For example, over the last few years we have committed  25 million to India to help build three fertiliser plants; one is in production and the remaining two should be completed within the nextfew months.(c) U.K. food aid11. As we have explained, we do not believe that food aid is a desirable alter-native to aid for increased local food production, or, indeed, for better protection against crop losses in the field and in store and more equitable systems of food distribution. But in the present situation without food aid millions could starve.This in the main must come from the traditional granaries of the world, but we canplay a direct minor role in the provision of milk products and some other specialfoods as well. However, most of the food aid which we can provide has to be bought from other countries.12. In the last^financial year we spent some  25 million on food aid, of which about  18 million was our share of the cost of E.E.C. food aid (which is described in more detail in Chapter IX). In the current financial year wehave earmarked  35 million for U.K. food aid, of which about  27 million will be our share of existing E.E.C. food aid programmes, about  4 million for proposed increases in these programmes, and about  4 million for ourdirect contributions to the World Food Programme.13. The main purpose of the World Food Programme (W.F.P.) is toprovide food aid in support of the economic and social development projects in developing countries. It also provides limited emergency aid in naturaldisasters. Over the last ten years W.F.P. has gained much experience in the handling of food aid for these purposes. Britain has supported W.F.P. since its inception, and we regard it as being more successful than any otherorganisation in the difficult task of using food as an instrument of economicand social development. We should like to see a higher proportion of thefood aid which is now given bilaterally channelled through W.F.P. Theresources of W.F.P. are provided on a voluntary basis by governments, andpledges are made for each calendar biennium. The U.K. pledge is normallydivided as to one-third in cash and two-thirds in commodities. The W.F.P.pledging target of US$440 million (about  190 million) for the biennium1975/76 has already been surpassed. It includes U.K. pledges amounting to 8.825 million.
14. Through our participation in multilateral programmes such as the E.E.C.programmes and the World Food Programme, we are working to ensure that special attention is given to the needs of the poorest and most desperatelydeficient countries. We shall continue to provide food aid so long as this is urgently required. But such aid can, and often does, have adverse effects on foodproduction and the distribution of income between rural and urban areas in the recipient countries. Most bilateral food aid is sold on the domestic market of the recipient country and in conditions of acute scarcity. This can help to reduceprices to levels which the poorest can afford. However, there is a danger that food aid released on the domestic market will depress prices to levels which provide no incentive to local farmers to maximise their output. In addition, the continuedavailability of food aid can have the effect of discouraging governments fromefforts to assist domestic food output. For these reasons we shall keep our food aid policy under continuous and careful review in the light of market conditionsin the world as a whole and in individual developing countries.
DISASTER RELIEFThe massive problems of many of the poorest developing countries are oftenmade worse by disasters such as floods, droughts, hurricanes and earthquakes.Until last year the only official provision for helping the victims was a limitedfund to cover first aid relief in the event of natural disasters; it did not cover the more insidious problems of drought and disease or disaster situations whichare &quot;man made&quot;. In general, official aid, it could be said, goes further and worksbetter when carefully related to the long-term development plans of carefully selected recipient governments. There are dangers of over-reaction, duplicationand waste when help is given in the immediate aftermath of a major disaster;and this is an area where voluntary agencies are particularly well placed to attract and deploy the contributions of the many people who feel moved toplay some part in the relief of human suffering.2. But there are also compelling arguments for using official aid to save lives and relieve suffering. What, for example, is the use of preparing for futured development if present disasters are allowed to spread hunger and disease? Is it right to help increase tomorrow^ harvests but wrong to keep alive today&apos;s poor;right to build schools and hospitals, but wrong to provide food and drugs forstarving children? And how can people in Britain who see on their televisionscreens the impact of disasters in a succession of poor countries be expectedto agree that the aid programme which they are financing should not be madeavailable to help the victims? There was therefore a logical, as well as a com-passionate, case for strengthening our own disaster relief arrangements and fortrying to improve the joint performance of the donor community.3. In June 1974 a Disaster Unit was set up in O.D.M., with the following main responsibilities:(i) to make contingency arrangements for the supply of transport, equipmentmedical supplies, and specialist personnel; and in particular to see thata stock of suitable vehicles is readily available for the transport of food and supplies in disaster areas;(ii) to monitor research and reports from official and non-official sourcesrelating to situations of impending disaster;(iii) to liaise with the United Nations Disaster Relief Office, aid agencies and voluntary bodies, and make sure that the British Governments contribu-tions are suitably related to theirs;(iv) to take responsibility in O.D.M. for executive action in respect of certaindesignated disaster situations in developing countries. The Unit works inclose consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, whichretains its existing responsibility in respect of natural disasters.4. It is a small Unit, working closely with official and unofficial groups here and overseas and drawing help and advice from a variety of sources. It has
access to the O.D.M.&apos;s Medical and Engineering Advisers and to those con-cerned with food aid and it gets a great deal of help from the Ministry of defence and the Crown Agents. In all its work it tries to make sure that O.D.M.&apos;sresponse to disasters is not only rapid and relevant but properly related to othercontributions.Contingency arrangements5. One of the Unifs first tasks the building up of a transport reserve reflected difficulties and delays that had been experienced in getting suitabletransport into drought stricken areas of the Sahel. The Unit began by building up a reserve of these four wheel drive Bedford lorries and Land Rovers. Toavoid delay it arranged for suitable second-hand vehicles to be purchased andreconditioned in the Department of Environment&apos;s workshops and to be storedby that Department at York. These are taken from the reserve as and whenneeded for disaster relief and any which are surplus to estimated relief require-ments are released for other aid purposes. This reserve forms part of a wide-ranging series of contingency plans.Early warning6. No two disasters are identical; and the first warning of danger may comefrom a variety of sources. The Unifs monitoring arrangements therefore cover a wide ground. It reviews and passes on to O.D.M. Geographical Departmentsreports from international agencies and other sources. With the help of O.D.M.&apos;sInformation Department, the Unit also monitors reports in the press and onradio and television, and British voluntary agencies have been consistentlyhelpful in supplying information about local situations of which their workersoverseas have particular knowledge.Liaison7. Over the past year the Unit has been building up contacts with the manyagencies responsible, here and overseas, with various aspects of disaster relief.It works closely with the Disasters Emergency Committee which exists to focusthe efforts of the main British voluntary agencies in respect of major disasters.8. The main focal point for international disaster relief is the United NationsDisaster Relief Co-coordinator&apos;s Office in Geneva (U.N.D.R.O.). Members ofthe Unit have discussions with U.N.D.R.O. officials about many aspects ofdisaster relief-including the need to help developing countries build up their capacity for dealing with disasters and are in hourly contact with Genevawhen a disaster strikes.Next steps9. H.M.G. has promised to contribute  200,000 over the next three years to a voluntary fund intended to increase U.N.D.R.O.&apos;s capacity. This will helpdeveloping countries to plan ahead and prepare for future disasters and will improve co-ordination of relief after a disaster partly by enabling U.N.D.R.O.to put people into the field where necessary and partly by improving its com-munications with aid donors.10. In the meantime we will help as best we can to promote local preparednessand to provide immediate disaster relief as and where it is most needed. Disasterrelief can be an essential first step towards development, particularly in the poorest countries.
CO-OPERATION WITH OTHER DONORS AND INTERNATIONALORGANISATIONS1. Chapter I explained that part of our new aid strategy was to promotesituations in which British concessional aid can stimulate matching contri-butions of concessional aid from other governments, and to encourage thedevelopment of such aid through both bilateral and multilateral channelstowards the poorest countries. This chapter and the following chapter(about the E.E.C.) set out some of the ways in which we are trying to achieve this.(a) The World Bank Group2. The World Bank Group is the largest of the multilateral developmentfinancing institutions. The Group has two main elements: the international bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) which now borrows all its funds from governments on the international capital markets and lendson near commercial terms; and the International Development Associa-tion (I.D.A.), which receives its funds as grants from governments of thericher countries and provides credits on highly concessional terms.3. The I.D.A. is currently disbursing funds from its 2nd, 3rd and 4thReplenishments. The 4th is in national currencies, for commitment by I.D.A.over the period 1974-1976. The British contribution is  206 million.4. I.D.A. funds are made available to the poorer developing countries,and concentrated on the poorest such as India, Bangladesh and other smallerAsian and African countries, almost all of it now to countries with per capita incomes in 1972 of less than $375 (about  120) per year, and a major part of countries with per capita incomes in 1972 of less than $130 (about 60). The British government welcomes and fully supports the intentionto concentrate these very scarce concessional funds on the poorest countries.5. The I.B.R.D. is hoping to raise the level of its annual commitments,most of them to countries with per capita incomes in 1972 of less than$850 (about  380) per annum, and about half to countries with 1972 per capita incomes of less than $400 (about  180) per annum. The BritishGovernment also welcomes and supports these plans of the I.B.R.D.6. The Bank has become increasingly concerned in recent years withthe situation of the poorest people in the developing countries, and it isadapting its pattern of lending to programmes within individual countries to correspond with this concept. A significant part of its lending will there-fore be devoted to directly improving the production capacity and incomes of the poorest group of people. Its chief &quot;target&quot; groups will be the small farmers and the landless in the rural areas, and the urban poor who are either unemployed or working for a very low income. The main effort will
however be made in rural areas; about one quarter of total Bank/I.D.A.future lending will go to agricultural projects and about half of this will be in rural projects aimed directly at improving the position of the poorestgroups.The Third WindowI. The Bank is establishing a lending facility to provide, initially for oneyear, loans additional to its normal programme at an interest rate inter-mediate between that now charged by the I.B.R.D. itself and that for I.D.A.credits. Almost all the lending will be to I.D.A. countries, with a concen-tration on those with per capita incomes under $200. The resources for thisfacility, known as the &quot;Third Window&quot;, are to be borrowed by the Bankin the normal way. The subsidy required to reduce its normal interest rates on these loans is being provided by a number of developed countries and oil producers.8. The original target for the Third Window was $1 billion (about  475million), which would require a subsidy fund of about $225 million (about 106 million). Hov/ever, as offers of contributions had reached only about half that amount, it was agreed in July 1975 to establish a $500 millionWindow in the first instance. The Third Window will start its lending opera-tions when at least $100 million (about  47.5 million) has been firmly com-mitted to the subsidy fund, hopefully in late October 1975.9. We have strongly supported this new facility on condition that mostof the resources will go to the poorest countries, and we have agreed tocontribute $10 million (about  4.75 million) to the subsidy fund for a $500million Window. If contributions from other donors, who have not yetpromised anything to the subsidy fund, reach a level sufficient to finance the $1 billion Window originally proposed, the UK would be prepared toconsider increasing its contribution to $15 million.(b) The International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.)10. The I.M.F. is not of course a development aid agency: its primary purpose is the promotion of international co-operation on monetary matters.But initiatives taken by the Fund in the wake of the 1973/74 oil price rises notably the establishment of the Oil Facility and the proposal for aspecial Subsidy Account associated with it represent extremely importantelements in the international effort to maintain development momentum inthe developing countries, particularly the poorest. The Fund has therefore been increasingly drawn into the area of development co-operation a factor which was relevant to the decision to set up the joint I.M.F./I.B.R.D.Development Committee see paragraph 16 below.(i) The Oil FacilityII. This was established in 1974 with resources of some $3.7 billion( 1.6 billion) of which about $3.2 billion was borrowed from oil producers,the rest from Canada and the Netherlands. Its purpose was to provideloans to countries facing large increases in oil import costs. The rate was per cent, then well below commercial rates, and loans were repayable overyears 3-7. Most drawings under the Facility were made by developing countries.
12. The Facility has been re-established for 1975, at a maximum of about$6 billion ( 2.6 billion). The conditions have been modified, but the bulkof the finance will, as before, come from the oil producers. Interest rates,at 1\ per cent., are now approaching commercial rates. The 39 I.M.F.members who are among the M.S.A.s (&quot;most seriously affected&quot;) will beentitled to some  800 million.(ii) The Special Account13. Because of the burden on the M.S.A.s of the near commercial interestrate on borrowings from the Oil Facility, described above, a &quot;SpecialAccount&quot; has been proposed to subsidise the interest rates for thesecountries. The Account would be made up of &quot;appropriate contributions&quot; byoil exporting and industrial countries.14. The main features of the scheme as proposed are that the rate shouldbe subsidised by up to 5 per cent., which would cost 350 million S.D.R.s(say,  180 million) over seven years, if the M.S.A. countries&apos; maximumaccess of about  800 million could be accommodated, and was actuallysought by them. The main potential contributors to the subsidy would bethe major oil exporters and the industrialised countries (O.E.C.D.), but it is recognised that a formal burden sharing agreement may not be achieved,and the list of contributors would be an open-ended one. This would mean that any subsidy could not necessarily be guaranteed for the full life of the loans. We have, however, declared our readiness to make an appropriatecontribution.(iii) The Special Trust Fund15. The I.M.F. is examining proposals for a Special Trust Fund to provide additional highly concessional funds for the developing countries, whichcould be disbursed more quickly than the Third Window loans (which areat present intended to be largely for development project aid). This fund would provide comparatively short term help for countries in immediatebalance of payments difficulties. We support the idea of such a Fund pro-vided its lending is to be concentrated on those countries with per capitaincomes of less than $200. We are prepared to contribute to a Trust fund for the poorest countries as well as to the Third Window, if, as we hope,a viable and acceptable scheme can be worked out and receives general support.(c) The Development Committee (I.M.F./LB.R.D. Joint Ministerial Com-mittee on the Transfer of Real Resources to Developing Countries)16. This Ministerial Committee, which includes representatives of bothindustrialised and developing countries, was set up by parallel resolutions of the I.M.F./I.B.R.D. in September 1974. It provides the opportunity for ministers from industrialised and developing countries to discuss all aspectsof the transfer of resources from developed to developing countries and itis our hope that the Committee will pay increasing attention to theproblems of the poorest sections of the world community.17. We also hope the Committee will agree on some criteria for theallocation of concessional flows. It is not yet universally accepted that the
main basis for distribution of scarce concessional money should be povertyand population, but the Development Committee will be taking a globalview of aid and this will be an opportunity to show that the poorest countries at least the large poor countries usually receive the lowest aidper capita. They might then hopefully indicate the scope for division of bilateral and multilateral flows of aid towards the poorest, includingcomments on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the differentpossible institutional channels for additional soft money.18. For the future work programme, accurate information about oilproducers&apos; aid commitments and disbursements is essential; without itdonors would have no basis on which to judge individual needs; anothermain objective should be to seek to co-operate with the oil producers in increasing concessional flows to the poorest countries. We hope therefore that the Committee will provide an opportunity for a wider dialogue betweenoil producing and consuming countries about co-operation in the develop-ment process. We describe below the steps which we are taking bilaterallyto achieve this dialogue.(d) Co-operation with the oil rich countries19. During the past year or so, the Middle East oil exporting states haveemerged as major donors of aid to other developing countries; still largely to those which are Arab or Islamic, but increasingly to other developing countries in Africa and Asia.20. The O.E.C.D. estimates that in 1974 O.P.E.C. commitments of bilateral concessional aid were about $5-9 billion ( 2,800 million), with about$2 billion ( 952 million) actually disbursed. Multilateral concessionarycommitments are estimated to have totalled some $1*6 billion ( 760million) in 1974, of which an estimated $0-5 billion ( 238 million) wasdisbursed to the institutions concerned. Saudi Arabia and Iran, withestimated disbursements of $0-9 billion and $0-5 billion respectively, werethe major O.P.E.C. donors. But much more money was provided on com-mercial or near-commercial terms for international financing institutions,including the I.B.R.D. and the I.M.F. The Arab oil producers broadened the base from which to operate aid programmes by increasing the capital of anumber of their own institutions, notably the Kuwait, the Abu Dhabi, the saudi and the Iraqi Funds. They are likely to continue, and indeed increase,the provision of capital on both commercial and concessionary terms.The Arab and other O.P.E.C. countries will probably provide a large partof the funds needed for the increased I.B.R.D. lending programme in the1976/1980 period, as well as much of the S.D.R. 5 billion ( 2-6 billion)proposed for the 1975 I.M.F. Oil Facility. These funds will be lent to these institutions at competitive interest rates and will be fully guaranteed, butthe Special Account requiring concessional funds, which is being set upto subsidise the interest rate for the drawing under the I.M.F.&apos;s Oil Facilityby the M.S.A. countries, would also receive contributions from the O.P.E.C.countries.21. We are anxious to co-operate with the oil producers in providingdirect assistance to the developing countries. We are seeking opportunities
where we can to help through the provision of feasibility studies, projectplanning and staff for project implementation, in association with capitalprovided by the Arab Funds.22. Co-operation with the oil producing countries is also being pursued in the context of their own plans for develoment. A number can noweasily finance their own development programmes. Their difficulties stemfrom lack of sufficient trained manpower to make the best use of their resources to develop their economies. We can help, but we have torecognise certain constraints. In the first place, our own financial resourcesmust increasingly be focused on help for the poorest. Our objective, there-fore, is to devise arrangements with the richest of the developing nations which involve little or no charge on the Aid Programme, and which ensurethat scarce manpower, etc. resources are allocated equitably between richand poor.(e) The Development Assistance Committee (D.A.C.)23. Another important international forum for the discussions of aidissues is the Development Assistance Committee (D.A.C.) of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.). This Committeeincludes representatives of the traditional aid donors other than the soviet bloc.24. The main objectives of the D.A.C. are:   to increase the volume of resources supplied to developing countries to improve the terms on which aid is provided to increase the efficiency of the resources made available in con-tributing to the development goals of the developing countries to increase the effectiveness of co-operation among donors andother development institutions.25. We have urged that the D.A.C. should consider ways and means toincrease the proportion of concessional aid given to the poorest countries,including the introduction of a new aid target which would relate thedistribution of aid to the poverty of the recipient country. We have sinceproposed that this new target might be that 60 per cent, of all bilateralofficial development assistance should go to countries with an average per capita income of under $200 per annum. Since they have about 60 per cent,of the population of all developing countries, this target if achieved wouldmean that the poorest countries would not get less than the average aid per head of all developing countries; at this stage, unfortunately, it would be unrealistic to expect that they should, as they need, get more than theaverage. We have also suggested that the D.A.C. should agree on a specialtarget for the terms of aid to the countries with per capita incomes below$200.(f) The UN and the Specialised Agencies(i) The UN Emergency Operation26. In May 1974, the U.N. launched an emergency operation to provide
quick disbursing additional aid for the M.S.A.s. This was basically anaccounting operation for new and additional bilateral action, althoughthe UN. also requested contributions to its own special account which itwas responsible for disbursing. The oil producers have provided commit-ments totalling nearly  1 billion (although this money may not all bedisbursed before the closing date of 30 June 1975 to make it eligible). TheO.E.C.D. commitment is about  0.4 billion, of which the E.E.C. countriescontributed about two-thirds, either jointly ($250 million or about  110million) or on a bilateral basis. We strongly supported this operation and did all we could, albeit unsuccessfully, to increase the E.E.C. joint contri-bution to S500 million or about  220 million. The total U.K. commitment to the Emergency Operation was about  84 million, of which  71 million was provided bilaterally and  13 million through the E.E.C.(ii) The United Nations Development Programme (U.N.D.P.)27. The U.N.D.P. has the responsibility for administering and co-ordi-nating the great majority of technical assistance provided through the U.N.system. Total voluntary contributions to U.N.D.P. for 1975 are expectedto be more than $400 million (about  170 million), the U.K. itself haspledged  10-25 million. U.N.D.P. assistance to developing countries is basedon a system of country programming, whereby recipient countries are given  an Indicative Planning Figure which denotes the amount of support a country can expect within the five year programming period.28. After prolonged discussion the 48 members of the U.N.D.P. Govern-ing Council have agreed on criteria (based in the main on population andper capita income) by which the anticipated resources for the secondprogramming period (1977-1981) are to be allocated. This has resulted inproposals for a larger share of resources for the poorest developing countries.29. Analysis of the U.N.D.P. expenditure indicates that more than 30per cent, of it already goes into agricultural development projects. Increas-ingly U.N.D.P. programmes are being designed along multi-disciplinary and inter--sectoral lines to cope with problems at the village level. Since 1968U.N.D.P. has undertaken six such broad based rural development schemes in Africa; these are intended to be pilot schemes which will be the basis forwider application of successful techniques and approaches in the future.(iii) United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (U.N.I.C.E.F.)30. An integral part of the United Nations is the United NationsChildren&apos;s Fund which is responsible for giving assistance, particularly to developing countries, in the development of permanent child health and welfare services. U.N.I.C.E.F.&apos;s income is provided annually on a voluntary basis, chiefly from governments but also from other sources. as u..N.I.C.E.F. helps the poorest sections of the community in developing countries and has a high reputation in doing so, it has long had the supportof the British Government. Out of estimated total pledges for 1975 of u.S.$103 million (about  43 million) the U.K. has pledged  2 million as its regular contribution. In addition we are giving contributions to severalspecial appeals.
(iv) The Food and Agricultural Organisation (F.A.O.)31. In the Preamble to F.A.O.&apos;s Constitution, member nations dedicatethemselves to the following aims:&quot;raising levels of nutrition and standards of living of the peoples under their respective jurisdictions; securing improvement in the efficiency ofthe production and distribution of all food and agricultural products;bettering the condition of rural populations; and thus contributingtowards an expanding world economy and ensuring humanity&apos;s freedom from hunger&quot;.The Constitution defines F.A.O.&apos;s functions under the Regular programme as being to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relatingto nutrition, food and agriculture (including fisheries and forestry), topromote and recommend relevant national and international action, and toprovide technical assistance.32. None of these functions refers specifically to rural poverty, but theF.A.O. Regular Programme is largely concerned with many aspects of rural development. One sector of the Programme which is directly aimed at the rural poor is that of the Human Resources, Institutions and AgrarianReform Division. This includes programmes in the fields of agricultural education and extension, land tenure, home economics and rural institutions.The U.K. has helped in recent years to bring about a strengthening of this division.33. Details of the Regular Programme are reviewed during the debates on the Programme of Work and Budget at the F.A.O. biennial conferences and more frequently in the F.A.O. Council; and there are specialist Com-mittees on Agriculture, Fisheries and Commodity Problems (among others) which meet between Sessions of the Conference. In all these discussions the U.K. representatives have taken the opportunity to stress theneed for an increasing concentration of F.A.O. programmes and projects onthe needs of the poorest countries and the poorest sections of the community in those countries.34. F.A.O. played a leading role in the preparation and conduct of theWorld Food Conference of 1974, in which rural development was a majortheme, and will be very much concerned with the various actions arisingfrom that Conference.(v) World Food Council35. As recommended by the World Food Conference of 1974, the U.N.General Assembly has created the World Food Council. The Council meetsat Ministerial or plenipotentiary level. It held its first Session in June thisyear. The U.K. was represented by the Minister of State, Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, Ministry of Overseas Development. On that occasion the U.K.announced its willingness to give another 100,000 tons of fertiliser throughthe F.A.O. Scheme (paragraph 10 of Chapter VI refers). The Council re-viewed as fully as the limited time allowed the progress so far made by the multilateral agencies and bodies in implementing the Resolutions of theWorld Food Conference; reached conclusions about the next action required
on various important elements in the current world food situation; and gave to the President and the Executive Director of the Council broadguidance on the method and content of the future work of the secretariat and the preparations for the next Session of the Council.(vi) United  Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural  Organisation(U.N.E.S.C.O.)36. In a speech to the 18th General Conference of U.N.E.S.C.O. in 1974,the then Minister of Overseas Development, Right Hon. Judith Hart MP,emphasised the following points:(i) U.N.E.S.C.O. should remember its vital role as an agent in thedevelopment process particularly with regard to the grave situationfacing the poorest and least developed countries.(ii) U.N.E.S.C.O. in considering its medium term objectives and in giving them a priority rating, should accord development assistanceto the Third World as the dominant concern in this decade and thenext.(iii) the structure and content of the education programme for the developing countries should be based on the criteria that theymust benefit the poorest countries and the poorest people.Subsequently in a resolution on objectives to be used as a basis for medium term planning the Conference recommended that U.N.E.S.C.O. should aimamongst other things to stress programmes designed specifically to benefit the least developed countries.37. As a follow up to this, U.N.E.S.C.O. is holding a meeting this year of senior officials of Ministries of Education of the least developed countries to try to pinpoint the major problems which arise in connection witheducational development in these countries. The aim of the meeting willbe to identify useful activities, to review education systems in general and encourage education for rural development and literacy in particular.38. With the support of the U.K., rural development has been an increasingly important component of U.N.E.S.C.O.&apos;s programmes. The 1974General Conference agreed that the main aims of U.N.E.S.C.O.&apos;s rural development programme should be the reform of education in rural areas and its orientation towards rural development and the development of technical education in agriculture, with particular attention being given tothe needs of the twenty-five least developed countries.39. The U.K. will continue to do all it can to ensure that U.N.E.S.C.O.&apos;work and programmes are increasingly concentrated on the needs of the poorest people in the poorest countries.(vii) The World Health Organisation (W.H.O.)40. In the W.H.O.&apos;s current work programme, which runs from 1973to 1977, the special needs of the least developed countries and of the poorestpeople in those countries are particularly taken into account. For example,W.H.O., together with other international organisations, is studying theproblems of providing drinkable water and the disposal of sanitary wastesin the poorest sections of the community. There is also a drive to providebasic health care systems which would call for a wide use, particularly in
rural areas, of health field-workers who would be trained to the variousstandards needed, below professional qualification. A similar drive againstmalnutrition, which is part of the W.H.Q. programme, includes directmeasures against deficiency diseases. The U.K. has helped promote andwill continue to support the emphasis which W.H.O. is giving to the prob-lems of the poorest.(viii) International Labour Organisation (I.L.O.)41. One of the major objectives of the I.L.O.&apos;s World Employment Pro-gramme is to help developing country governments to improve the situation of the rural poor. The I.L.O. has been involved in work on various aspectsof rural employment problems for a number of years, but this effort hasrecently been focused in a specific rural employment promotion pro-gramme, and a joint inter-agency approach has been developed, mainly with F.A.O. and the World Bank.
THE E.C.C.-A NEW DIMENSION1. On entry into the E.C.C. Britain became a party to a number of community commitments involving developing countries. These includedAssociation with certain Mediterranean countries; membership of the food aid Convention; the negotiation under Protocol 22 of a new set of relation-ships with 46 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific(the A.C.P.s), and the obligation to align Britain with the Community&apos;scheme of Generalised Preferences for developing countries. (This Schemeallows duty free or preferential duty rates for most manufactured andprocessed agricultural exports from developing countries entering the Com-munity.)2. Before and after accession successive British Governments have called for a more comprehensive and world wide Community aid policy. the protocol 22 negotiations with the 46 A.C.P.S were an important step in thisdirection. Formerly nearly all Community development assistance had been directed either to dependent territories of Community members or, underthe terms of the Yaounde Convention, to 18 &quot;Associated&quot; states (plusMauritius from 1973) all of which had been dependencies of E.E.C.countries.3. But outside these negotiations were some of the most populous andpoorest states in the developing world, especially the independent developing commonwealth countries in Asia. These were eligible for some trade benefits and for food aid from the Community but not for financial help. Howeverjust before British accession, in October 1972, the Community agreed that&quot;without detracting from the advantages enjoyed by countries with whichit has special relations it must respond even more than in the past to the expectations of ail the developing countries&quot;. The Community also under-took in the Joint Declaration of Intent annexed to the Treaty of accession to give special consideration to the trade policies of the independent Com-commonwealth Asian countries.4. Successive British Governments have wanted to see these intentionsturned into action. In a statement to the Council of Ministers in April 1974the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary summed up our objectives asfollows:Generous terms of access to the E.E.C. market for the agricultural and industrial products of those countries eligible for Association withthe Community under Protocol 22 of the Treaty of Accession;Improved arrangements for the trade with the E.E.C. of those develop-ing Commonwealth countries for which the option of Association wasnot open;
Improvements in the Community&apos;s scheme of generalised trade prefer-ences for developing countries; and community aid policies going wider than those countries eligible forAssociation.5. Major improvements along these lines have taken place but muchremains to be done.(a) Protocol 22 and the Lome Convention6. The Protocol 22 negotiations began in July 1973 and the new Con-vention was signed in Lome on 28 February 1975. It will formally come intoforce when it has been ratified by the nine Community members and twothirds of the 46 A.C.P.S who signed the Convention but interim arrange-ments are being made to implement its trade and aid benefits with effectsfrom 1 July 1975.7. The most important elements of the Convention are:  (i) The European Development Fund (E.D.F.). Aid totalling some  1,600mwill be provided from the Fund for the A.C.P.S over the next fiveyears. This is in addition to an agreed  200m in soft loans from theEuropean Investment Bank.(ii) Industrial co-operation. While agricultural and rural development willbe the major sector assisted by the E.D.F., the Convention breaks newground by providing for the establishment of a Committee on In-dustrial Co-operation and a centre for Industrial Developmentdesigned to promote the development and diversification of industryin the A.C.P.S and help bring about a better distribution of industrywithin those countries and between them.(iii) Stabex. This is the name given to a new scheme funded from theE.D.F. to help stabilise the commodity export earnings of the A.C.P.S.It will cover such products as cocoa, coffee, cotton and copra and onemineral, iron ore. The scheme is one to which the developing countriesattach very great importance.(iv) Sugar. The Community undertook to purchase and import for an indefinite period specific quantities of cane sugar, raw and white,originating in A.C.P. States plus specific quantities from Belize,Surinam and St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla and from India under theterms of the Joint Declaration of Intent. From the standpoint of the developing countries, the new arrangements are no less favourable than those which applied under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreementwith the U.K.(v) Access for A.C.P. countries&apos; exports. The Convention provides forthe free entry into the Community market of industrial products andthe almost completely free entry of agricultural products. Points ofparticular concern to Commonwealth countries were beef (important to Botswana, Swaziland and Kenya) and bananas and rum (important to the Caribbean countries).(vi) Non-reciprocity. Under the terms of the Yaounde&quot; Convention, the associated States were required to give duty-free treatment to importsfrom the Community in return for the preferences they received in theE.E.C. The Lome Convention contains no parallel provisions. The
A.C.P. are simply required to treat imports from the E.E.C. member states in a non-discriminatory manner and at least as favourably asthose from other developed countries.(vii) Nomenclature. The term of &quot;Association&quot; which describes the Com-munity&apos;s Convention with the 18 &quot;Yaounde&quot; countries has been drop-ped. The new Convention is known simply as the A.C.P./E.E.C.Convention of Lome. To some extent this is a symbolic change as it also reflects a new co-operative relationship between the community and the A.C.P. which many see as a &quot;new model&quot; for relations betweenthe developed and developing world as a whole.(viii) Help for dependent territories. The Community will shortly be pro-mulgating a regulation to apply broadly similar provisions to those inthe new Convention to its own dependent territories, which so far asthe U.K. is concerned include the West Indian Associated States. Anadditional sum of about  70 million will be set aside (including about 5 million from the European Investment Bank) together with some 10 million for the application of the Stabex scheme to those terri-tories.(b) Community assistance to other developing countries8. In a speech to the Council of Development Ministers on 30 April 1974the then Minister of Overseas Development, Right Hon. Judith Hart M.P.,drew attention to the imbalance in the distribution of the Community&apos;s aid to the developing world and called for the E.E.C.&apos;s total aid effort to relatemore adequately to development needs. In July 1974 the Community agreedto the principle of financial and technical aid from the Community to countries not formally &quot;Associated&quot; nor covered by, the offer of a special relationship with it. It was also agreed that the Commission should prepare a paper outlining Community development assistance plans for the years ahead.9. The Commission have now made specific proposals, which are understudy by Member States, for a five year programme of financial and tech-nical aid for those developing countries not covered by the Lome convention or the special arrangements (the &quot;Non-Associates&quot;) starting in 1976. Themain emphasis is on agricultural and rural development. We support theseproposals and hope that they will soon be agreed and implemented.10. Meanwhile the Community has contributed $250 million of financialassistance from its own budgetary resources to the United Nations Emer-gency Measures for developing countries hardest hit by the rise in oil andother commodity prices. The Community also provided substantial food aid and approximately 70 per cent, of this went to the developing Common-wealth countries in Asia.(c) Food aid11. Food aid financed from the Community budget is distributed on a world-wide basis and about 70 per cent, now goes to &quot;Non-Associated&quot;developing countries. Approximately half of it is provided as cereals underthe Food Aid Convention and about half in the form of dairy products e.g.skimmed milk and butter oil. 1975 expenditure from the Community budget
is expected to total about  94 million. Commission proposals for increasingthis amount are being studied by Member States in the light of recom-mendations from the World Food Conference.12. Britain takes a sympathetic view of these proposals in the current situation facing poor food-importing countries but believes (as explained in Chapter VI) that the long term solution must lie in greater investment,more financial aid and better incentives for increased agricultural produc-tion within the developing countries. This is one of the reasons why theGovernment considers that Community food aid should be complementedbe a planned Community programme of financial aid to the &quot;Non-associated -ated&quot; developing countries with a special emphasis on assistance withmeasures to increase food production.(d) Trade benefits from the Community to developing countries13. These are discussed in the following chapter.
TRADE POLICIES AND THE POOREST countries. Aid and trade are complementary facets within the area of co-operationbetween developed and developing countries and both play an important part in the formation of British foreign policy. Trade is important in thedevelopment process and trade policies must take account of aid efforts.This White Paper would therefore be incomplete without some mention oftrade policies in which the UK. is involved and which affect the poorest countries.(a) G.A.T.T. trade negotiations2. A key area involving developing country trade interests is the current&quot;Tokyo&quot; round of the G.A.T.T. multilateral trade negotiations (M.T.N.s).The Tokyo Declaration issued by the G.A.T.T. Council of Ministers in 1973gives particular emphasis to the special needs of the developing countries.While as a general principle negotiated reductions in tariff or non-tariff barriers will be on a reciprocal basis, the Tokyo Declaration neverthelessrecognises that the developing countries should be given special and morefavourable treatment where this is feasible and appropriate.3. We fully subscribe to the Tokyo Declaration and are glad that theEuropean Commission (which is representing the E.E.C. in the negotiations)has been given a liberal negotiating mandate in respect of the developing countries.4. On tariffs, the Community has as its objective a tariff harmonisationapproach which would produce on average tariff cuts in the range of25-50 per cent. Once the general formula has been agreed consideration will be needed on how to take specific measures on products of particular interest to the developing countries particularly the poorest and this could be done by applying larger and/or faster tariff reductions.(b) Generalised Scheme of Preferences5. Another area in the trade field relevant to development policy is theGeneralised Scheme of Preference (G.S.P.). With effect from I January 1974,the United Kingdom has participated in the Community Scheme.6. The G.S.P. was originally conceived as a means of encouraging in-dustrial diversification by the granting of generous tariff preferences tothe developing countries in industrialised markets. It was seen as the naturalcounterpart of investment and export incentives offered by the developing countries themselves.7. But there are limitations to the value of the schemes in providingstimulus to industrialisation and economic development. Decisions aboutinvestment in new industries or in expanding capacity depend on manyfactors, of which preferential access to markets is only one. Moreoveralthough the E.E.C.&apos;s G.S.P. covers a reasonably broad range of products,
it contains a number of limitations on preferential access in areas particularlysensitive for domestic producers.8. The U.K. welcomed the improvements made to the E.E.C.&apos;s GeneralisedScheme of Preference in 1974 and 1975. For 1975, the list of products subjectto particular restrictions has been substantially reduced and the potentialtrade coverage of the scheme overall was increased by about 15 per cent.For the future, the Community is committed by a Council Resolution tocarry out continuous and progressive improvement to the scheme and topay particular attention in this to the needs of the poorest developing countries.9. But there are limits on the extent to which progressive trade liberation-lisation can be used to bring benefits specifically to the poorest beneficiaries.So far poorer countries have had a fairly low share of trade under G.S.P.which has been dominated by a small group of more advanced developing countries, mainly in South East Asia and Latin America, which export verycompetitively on a large scale. Poorer countries&apos; restricted use of the schemestems from their low level of industrial development rather than limitationsin the scheme itself. The Community&apos;s G.S.P. contains provisions to ensurethat the more competitive developing countries do not monopolise its bene-fits at the expense of the less advanced. Information and educationalmeasures to assist poorer countries to make fuller use of the opportunitiesavailable can be particularly helpful.(c) Export promotion10. Export promotion is of increasing importance as a means of directlyincreasing developing countries&apos; export earnings. The main channel forassistance is the U.N.C.T.A.D./G.A.T.T. International Trade Centre (I.T.C.)which provides training in export promotion techniques, helps establishexport promotion organisations in developing countries and undertakesanalyses of the market opportunities in the developed countries for develop-ing country exports. Through a liaison office in the Department of Trade,H.M.G. gives practical support to the work of the I.T.C.11. The Community also operates programmes of trade promotion. Activi-ties include financing visits by trade missions from developing countries,providing specialist advisers, financing developing country participation in trade fairs and exhibitions, publishing information on products exportedby individual developing countries and organising seminars to help bene-beneficiaries to obtain greater benefit from the G.S.P.12. To complement these international and Community financed mea-sures, H.M.G. established with the London Chamber of Commerce inDecember 1973 an Import Opportunities Office for Developing Countrieswhich provides information on market opportunities, arranges contacts between U.K. importers and developing country exporters and generallyacts as a contact and information point in the U.K. for businessmen andthe developing country trade representatives. The Tropical Products Institute(T.P.I.) of the Ministry of Overseas Development also undertakes someexport promotion work as part of its general involvement with the post-harvest aspects of research and development into renewable natural re-
sources. Activities include market research, research into new uses fornatural materials and projects to promote processing of natural products in developing countries.(d) Commodities13. There are also implications for aid policy in the U.K. initiativeon commodities launched by the Prime Minister at the CommonwealthHeads of Government Meeting in Kingston in May this year.1 In his speechthe Prime Minister reaffirmed the need for economic interdependence andargued that, in an expanding world economy, wealth should be shared moreequitably between nations and peoples. He put forward the idea of establish-ing a general agreement on commodities. The object of this would be tohelp in achieving a more orderly, stable and equitable conduct of inter-national trade in commodities which would be of mutual advantage to developing and developed countries, whether as producers or consumers.These ideas have since received wide international support and it isH.M.G.&apos;s policy to maintain the momentum of this initiative by promotingits discussion in many fora, in particular the United Nations.14. Among the specific proposals for action put forward by the UnitedKingdom at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April1975 was the conclusion where suitable of international commodity agree-ments, supported as appropriate by regulatory mechanisms such as inter-national buffer stocks, co-ordination of nationally held stocks, productioncontrols and export quotas. But not all producers are developing countries,and some commodities produced by developing countries may be particularly difficult candidates for effective commodity agreements. As a comple-mentary approach therefore the United Kingdom proposals include theestablishment of a framework of a scheme for the stabilisation of developingcountry export earnings from commodities.15. Under these proposals attempts would be made to take account ofthe needs of the poorest developing country producers. One of the possible ways to do this might be to devise favourable terms for these countries inany scheme of export earnings stabilisation.^ee Cmnd. 6061: World Economic Interdependence and Trade in Commodities.H.M.S.O. 1975.
SUMMARYIt may be helpful to summarise the main points set out in the precedingchapters.Chapter I: Our new aid policies and whyDespite the achievements of the national and international developmentefforts of the last 25 years, many developing countries still face a numberof seemingly intractable problems: large-scale unemployment or underemployment, rapid population growth, food shortages and malnutrition and,increasingly, a polarisation between a small, relatively prosperous, modernsector and a large, very poor and mainly rural, traditional sector. the response to these long term problems must rest largely with the developing countries themselves but, especially for the poorest countries, internationalassistance on concessional terms is essential to ensure that they achievesome improvement in average living standards in the next generation.The radical economic changes of the last year or so have seriously erodedthe growth prospects of many developing countries. But the developing countries cannot be considered as a homogenous group in terms of their ability to cope with the current situation, and recognition of this diversitymust be reflected in our aid policy. It is the poorest countries, those withper capita incomes under $200 (or about  90) representing a third of theworld&apos;s population, for whom the prospects are very bleak indeed. Unlessconcessional aid flows to these particular countries are increased, theiraverage living standard, already very low, will improve only very slightlybetween now and 1980. But truly concessional aid is a scarce resource andas such must be directed where it can have the most effect in alleviatingthe worst poverty over the long term. The three legs of our new aid strategyare therefore:(a) to give an increasing emphasis in our bilateral aid towards the poorest countries, especially those in this group most seriously affected by therise in the price of oil and other commodities;(b) to give a special emphasis to programmes oriented towards the poorest groups within these countries, and especially to rural develop-ment; and(c) to promote situations in which British concessional aid funds can bestserve to stimulate matching contributions from other governments,and to encourage the deployment of such aid through both multi-lateral and bilateral channels towards the poorest countries.Chapter II: Allocating U.K. aid between countries the Government is anxious to achieve the greatest possible distributionof British aid to the poorest countries. But first it has to be decided whichare the countries most in need. Gross national product gives a roughapproximation of current income levels, but future levels must also be con-
sidered. The general intention is therefore to look towards a greater con-centration of our aid, other than that provided for the Dependent territories and Associated States, on those countries with per capita incomes of lessthan $200 and, within that group, on those with worse growth prospectsthan the average. In this we shall take account of other donors&apos; aid, andwhether a country is likely to have other substantial sources of foreign exchange.It is the Governments policy to relate the terms of our aid to theeconomic circumstances of the recipient country, and since mid-1975government to government aid commitments to countries with a per capitaincome of less than $200 are now made on grant terms.Chapter III: The problems of ensuring that British aid directly benefits the poorest sections of the community the determining factor is the attitudes and policies of the recipient govern-ments. We are particularly able to give the most effective help possible tothose governments which see the need for, and are trying to implement,policies and programmes directly affecting poverty, employment and income distribution. More directly, we shall wish to co-operate with recipientgovernments to ensure that so far as possible our aid results in benefits for the poorest sections of the community. In particular, we would wishto concentrate on assistance for programmes for rural development.Chapter IV: Rural developmentMost of the poorest people in developing countries live and for the fore-seeable future will continue to live in the rural areas: for this reason weare placing special emphasis on rural development. Increased agricultural production is at the heart of such programmes, but we recognise it is not sufficient to think only in terms of raising productivity and income inagriculture. The challenge is that this should be done in ways which mini-mise the displacement of labour, so as not to aggravate the serious problemsof underemployment facing most developing countries. Effective rural development requires an integrated approach with attention paid to suchmatters as rural roads, water control, credit facilities, marketing machinery,elementary education and rural health facilities.The process of identifying, formulating, initiating and implementing rural development programmes which we can assist is likely to take longer thanmost other forms of assistance, and we accept that it will take time for thenew emphasis on rural development to be reflected in the composition ofour aid programme. However, we have made it known to recipient govern-ments that we wish to help them promote rural development and foodproduction through our bilateral aid programme and are exploring ways of assisting international agencies with projects which are already on the stocks. In the meantime, we are building up our capacity in the Depart-ment, overseas in the missions and development divisions, and in establish-ing appropriate research and training, so that we may best be able to offer the assistance which is required.Chapter Y: Policies in the other main sectorsPoverty oriented programmes call for action in sectors other thanagriculture.
(a) EducationHigh priority must be given to expanding appropriate basic education.We are anxious to bring such assistance as we can to help governmentsfoster its development. We also have to be prepared to help with thedevelopment of appropriate technical skills in various ways. But the poorest countries will require skills necessary for administration and we therefore continue to support education at all levels in these countries. We shall continue to provide training and further education in this country for thosewho require it.(b) Housing and urban development the housing needs of the poorest sections of the community in develop-ing countries, particularly in urban areas, are immense. Conventional low-cost housing schemes are not the answer. We believe that our aid in this sector should be focused on &quot;site and service&quot; schemes which encourageself help.(c) PopulationAttempts must be made to slow down the population growth in the developing countries and we wish to give high priority to aid for populationmatters. But population aid is not merely a matter of family planning pro-grammes, since a rise in living standards appears to be a necessary pre-requisite. There is a close connection between family planning and other aspects of development and we intend to give high priority to this integratedapproach.(d) health the poorest countries have serious health problems which will call for particular attention to be paid to public health, nutrition, water supplies and other measures to prevent disease. We wish therefore to increase the emphasis on medical aid to community health and preventative healthschemes in rural areas, rather than to large hospitals and specialist curativeservices.Chapter VI: The special problems of world food and fertilisersThe basic need of the poor is sufficient and adequately nutritious food.It is necessary to distinguish between immediate world food problems andthe longer term prospects. This means that although in the short terman important emphasis for external aid donors must be on food aid, thefocus of attention in both the short and longer terms must be on increasedagricultural production in the developing countries.Assistance to agriculture and especially food production is an essential part of our bilateral rural development programmes. We are supportingrelevant research and exploring methods of helping agricultural investmentthrough the multilateral agencies. We also intend to do all we can to help to provide the incentive to the farmer to surpass the target of feedinghimself and his family.One of the key factors in increasing food production is the provisionof fertiliser. We are supplying some fertiliser and we are also anxious tohelp countries create or improve their own sources of fertiliser supply.In the present circumstances without food aid millions could starve.
We are playing our part both bilaterally and multilaterally in providing suchemergency assistance.Chapter VII: Disaster reliefUntil last year, the O.D.M. had no special arrangements for disasterrelief on the grounds that scarce concessional resources would have amore lasting effect when carefully related to long term development plans;relief operations could be well handled by the voluntary agencies. How-ever there were also compelling arguments in favour of using the aid programme to save lives and relieve suffering, so a special Disaster Unitwas set up in the O.D.M. in June 1974. In all its work the Unit tries toensure that the U.K. response to disasters is not only rapid and relevantbut properly related to other contributions.Chapter VIII: Co-operation with other donors and internationalorganisationsPart of the new aid strategy is to promote situations in which Britishconcessional aid can best serve to stimulate matching contributions fromother governments, and to encourage the deployment of such aid throughboth multilateral and bilateral channels towards the poorest countries.(a) 1.B.R.D./I.D.A. We fully support and welcome the intentions thattheir scarce concessional resources should be concentrated on the poorest countries, and that an increasing proportion of future lending will be devoted directly to improving the productive capacity and income of the poorest people in developing countries, particularly in the rural sector.We also strongly support and are contributing to, the subsidy fund of thenew facility (the Third Window), which will provide additional concessionalloans to the developing countries, particularly the poorest.(b) I.M.F. We welcomed the establishment of an Oil Facility in 1974 toprovide loans to countries facing large increases in oil import costs. Thereis a new element in the extension of the Facility into 1975, namely a SpecialAccount to subsidise the interest rate on borrowings made by the M.S.A.countries. We are in favour of this and are contributing to the subsidyaccount. We are also prepared to support the proposed Special Trust Fund,if it is to be mainly for the poorest countries.(c) The Development Committee. As this Ministerial Committee on theTransfer of Real Resources to Developing Countries includes representativesof both industrialised and developing countries it provides an excellentopportunity, of which we wish to take advantage, to co-ordinate inter-national action on help for the poorest countries.(d) Co-operation with the oil rich countries. During the past year, the oilproducing countries have emerged as major donors of aid. We are doing all we can to co-operate with them to help the poorest developing countriesthrough multilateral channels. We are also exploring the possibility ofproviding technical assistance to be used in association with capital fromArab Funds, particularly for the poorest countries.(e) The Development Assistance Committee. This is an important forum for co-ordinating the policies of aid donors where we have urged that
clear and agreed criteria be developed for the country allocation of aid inorder to get more for the poorest countries.(f) The U.N. and the specialised agencies. The U.N. Emergency Opera-tion, to which Britain contributed, provided quick disbursing aid for the developing countries most seriously affected by the rise in oil prices. Apartfrom this specific programme, we are doing all we can to encourage thevarious specialised agencies of the U.N. to increase the concentration oftheir programmes on the needs of the poorest countries and poorest people in those countries.Chapter IX: The E.E.C. a new dimensionOn entry into the E.E.C., Britain became a party to a number of Com-munity commitments involving developing countries. We played an active part in the Protocol 22 negotiations with the 46 A.C.P.S which culminatedin the Lome convention of February 1975.But we believe that the Community should have a world-wide aid policy.This means their doing more for the most populous and poorest states inthe developing world who are eligible for some trade benefits and for food aid, but can not call on the European Development Fund.Chapter X: Trade policies and the poorest countries(a) G.A.T.T. trade negotiations. We fully subscribe to the Tokyo declara-tion which gives particular emphasis to the needs of the developing countries.(b) Generalised Scheme of Preferences. The U.K. welcome the liberalisa-tion of the E.E.C.&apos;s scheme of tariff preferences.(c) Export promotion. Both we bilaterally and the E.E.C. collectivelyare providing programmes of trade promotion for the developing countries.(d) Commodities. The U.K. initiative on commodities launched by thePrime Minister at Kingston may have implications for aid policy. Underthese proposals attempts would be made to take account of the needs ofthe poorest developing country producers.

ANNEX ITHE OVERALL FINANCIAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK1. The size of the British Aid Programme, like all British public expen-diture programmes, depends first of all on the decisions taken by theGovernment on total public expenditure and, secondly, on how this money is to be divided up between particular programmes such as aid, defence,education and housing. These decisions are taken annually in the context ofthe Public Expenditure Survey; this is when the planning figures for fiveyears ahead are reviewed and rolled forward by a year. By this method,competing claims on the available money are brought together and therelative priorities of the various needs are weighed against each other. Thefinal decisions are published in the annual White Paper on Public Expen-diture.2. In addition to these annually agreed sums for aid provided from thepublic purse (usually referred to as the net aid programme), there is also an arrangement whereby the repayment of the capital (but not the interest)of past aid loans received each year is added to this net programme. In1975/76, the figure is about  40 million rising to about  60 million in threeyears&apos; time.3. In 1975/76 (the British financial year runs from April to March) thenet Aid Programme will be  430.7 million. When amortisation is added,this gives a gross British Aid Programme for that year of  471.4 million.4. In 1970 the United Nations set as a target that the industrialised countries should transfer to the developing countries not less than 1 percent, of their G.N.P. This target included both private investment and official assistance, but within this target there was a second specific targetthat 0.7 per cent, of G.N.P. should be given in the form of official develop-ment assistance.5. The Government has accepted the 1 per cent, target and in 1974accepted in principle the target of 0.7 per cent, (in 1974 performanceagainst the 1 per cent, target was 1.20 per cent.1 and in that year Britishofficial development assistance was 0.38 per cent, of our G.N.P.).- It is notyet possible, however, to say, when the target of 0.7 per cent, will bereached; this must be subject to the progress of our own economy as wellas to other calls on our resources.The Aid Framework6. Once the Public Expenditure Survey has established the levels of future aid programmes in net constant prices, and these figures have beentranslated into cash, the next step is for the O.D.M. to indicate on the samerolling basis as applies to the annual Surveys, how the funds should beiPartly based on figures which are still provisional.
divided between various types of aid, such as multilateral and bilateral,and within the latter category between the various recipient countries.Experience has shown that most forecasts of future expenditures err onthe side of optimism and before the total is divided, therefore, the gross aid programme figures for each year are written up to include an estimatingadjustment to allow for such &quot;slippage&quot;.7. This done, the Ministry prepares each year a so-called &quot;Aid Frame-work&quot;. This provides, in terms of expected disbursements, a detailedbreakdown of expenditure on every major item in the aid programme forthe next four years, i.e. it gives figures for bilateral capital aid, technical assistance and pensions payments to each individual country as well asallocations for all other expenditures from the Aid Programme such as itscontributions to the various multilateral organisations and programmes,and technical assistance not susceptible to territorial allocation.8. This Framework is agreed with other interested Government depart-ments and then become the basis on which the Ministry of overseas development makes new aid commitments. It is not published because itis based on intentions and assumptions which may not be realised, butindividual commitments such as a loan to a particular country are announcedas soon as they have been entered into.Country policy papers9. To help in the analysis of all the factors which need to be taken intoaccount in reaching decisions on the make up of the British aid programme to individual countries, a country policy paper (C.P.P.) is prepared for eachof our main recipient countries. Papers on very similar lines are also pre-pared on the Dependent Territories. Against a background of the economicsituation in the country concerned, historical, political and commercial considerations, an assessment of past programmes and development potentialand prospects, these papers set out a suggested programme for British aid for the country or territory concerned for the next few years. Among other things it sets out the pointers for various forms of aid (e.g. the balance between financial aid and technical assistance, the balance between project and programme aid), and the specific terms of aid (e.g. the need for localcost aid etc.) which is regarded as desirable for that particular country.10. Once the paper has been agreed by the British mission in the country concerned and by all the relevant Government departments, it provides an agreed programme which can then be translated in practice by the O.D.M.
THE MAIN FORMS OF BRITISH BILATERAL AID AND HOW WECONTROL AND EVALUATE them. British bilateral aid like most bilateral aid can be divided into two main categories:(a) financial aid which is normally provided as a grant or loan of money.This may be used to help finance specific development projects suchas a flood protection scheme, to pay for the import of specific capital equipment needed to create new or expanded capacity (for example,the provision of electrical generators to provide new or extra capacity in a rural electrification scheme which in itself may be part of alarger rural development project) or to provide an assortment of goods and services such as fertilisers and pesticides to enable existing pro-ductive facilities to be more fully utilised.(b) technical assistance or manpower aid which is financed by grants andnot loans. The main purpose of this type of aid is to facilitate thetransfer of appropriate knowledge and skills from Britain to the developing countries. This normally involves training or further educa-tion for developing country nationals or the provision of Britishexperts who may work in an operational capacity or who increasingly,act as advisers or consultants.2. In 1974 of the  261 million spent on British bilateral aid,  185 million(71 per cent.) was capital aid and  76 million (29 per cent.) was technical assistance. This chapter discusses these main forms of British aid and theway in which they are controlled and evaluated to ensure that both theBritish taxpayer and the developing country get value for money.FINANCIAL AID(a) Project aid3. This may be defined as the provision of aid needed to finance a specificinvestment project in a developing country where the investment can be identified and subjected to a detailed appraisal.4. Once a project is tentatively identified as likely to be suitable for financing from the British aid programme the next step is to submit itto a rigorous and careful appraisal. It is to the mutual benefit of thoseproviding development finance and those receiving it that value for money is obtained. The fact that under the British aid programme finance isprovided on concessional terms makes it no less important to ensure thatthe economic return to the projects it supports as well as social benefits ismaximised.
5. The careful appraisal of projects is an important means of achieving this objective and of ensuring that the taxpayers&apos; money is well spent.Over the years the O.D.M. has, in association with scholars in BritishUniversities, devoted a great deal of effort towards evolving practicalmethods of project appraisal which are adapted to the special conditionsof developing countries. Methods can be adapted to local circumstances and can, for instance, take due account of the high levels of unemploymentor under-employment which often prevail in developing countries, and ofthe fact that local markets sometimes do not reflect the true costs and benefits arising from development projects.6. The need for careful project appraisal is widely recognised but diffi-culties have been caused for the recipients arising from the different require-ments of different agencies. It has also to be recognised that the purposeof project appraisal is not simply to enable development finance agenciesto decide whether or not to finance a particular investment. It is an essential part of the planning process in developing countries to ensure that all theresources, whether domestic or from external sources, available are wellspent.7. In order to make clear our approach to project appraisal and toprovide training material, the O.D.M. published its &quot;Guide to ProjectAppraisal in Developing Countries&quot;.1 Some 4,000 copies have now been sold, or distributed as part of our technical assistance to planning officersin developing countries, to consultants and to other development financeagencies. The Guide has also been translated into French and 300 copiesof the translation have so far been distributed.8. Attempts have been made to bring more uniformity in project appraisalprocedures among development finance agencies. To this end the O.D.M.have engaged in discussions with a number of agencies in Europe and withthe World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Whileit is still the case that different agencies have different approaches, thereis now a much greater consensus as to the importance of such issues aspoverty and unemployment and their implications for project appraisal.9. A great many projects in the health and education field for exampledo not produce benefits which can readily be expressed in quantitativeterms and here the problem is to ensure that objectives are carefully defined and the most economical method of achieving them chosen.10. In the discussion of projects with the recipients it is often possibleto identify alternative ways of doing things which will reduce costs and increase benefits. It is as a method of helping recipients to discover suchalternatives and to improve the effectiveness of the planning process as awhole that the project appraisal procedure has its principal justification.For this reason our approach is flexible and we do not attempt to impose a rigid approach on all countries.lHMSO 1972.
(b) Capital goods aid11. Capital goods aid is provided to cover the cost to a developingcountry of importing capital equipment and other goods required to createnew productive capacity or expand existing productive capacity. It can be distinguished from project aid only by the fact that it is usually provided in circumstances in which it is impracticable for O.D.M. to make a detailedappraisal of the project in which the equipment or goods will be used.This normally happens when the cost of the imported equipment financed by British aid forms a relatively small amount of the total project cost:for example, a developing country may be undertaking a large and wide-spread feeder road programme to link up isolated rural communities withmarkets for their cash crops. Such a programme would normally be under-taken by the local public works department making use of local labour for most of the construction work. But some parts of such a programme may require the use of construction machinery or equipment which needs to be imported. Such machinery, the cost of which would only be a small partof the cost of the total project, might well be used in several different areasdepending on the various problems which might arise during the construc-tion of the roads. In such circumstances a detailed appraisal by O.D.M. ofthe entire project before the equipment is supplied would not be justified,though we do expect the country itself to have appraised the whole roads programme concerned and this kind of aid would be judged in that context.12. However, although there is no detailed appraisal of the project forwhich the machinery or equipment is required, O.D.M. does make ageneral apprasial for each allocation of all Miscellaneous Capital GoodsLoans. In doing this we examine, among other things, the developmentpriority accorded to the sector in which the investment will be made andthe development value of the project or programme in which the goodswill be used.(c) General development aid or programme aid13. This is used for the provision of goods or services which cannot be identified with any particular investment project or sectoral investment programme. Its main forms are maintenance aid, debt relief, and food aid.(Our food aid policy is described in Chapter VI.)(i) Maintenance aid14. This is basically a form of balance of payments support. It usuallycovers a very wide variety of goods and services which may be needed for many different purposes. Rigid control such as the detailed examination of every item required and a follow up of its use is not onlypractically impossible but would involve a large-scale and resented inter-ference in the day to day work of the local government. But there must besufficient control to ensure that the aid is directed towards proper develop-mental purposes. It is not easily possible to prescribe methods of controlapplicable to all countries since the degree of control required will vary from country to country according to the strength or weakness of thelocal administration and their ability to ensure that effective and appropriateuse is made of whatever goods or services are provided.15. For these reasons O.D.M. tries to adapt its control of such aid to
the particular circumstances of each country for which such aid is being provided. Various techniques are used such as a positive &quot;shopping list&quot;v/hich lists the general categories of goods that may be purchased out of a loan. In those countries where there is a greater likelihood of the misuseof maintenance aid, it is necessary to impose much stricter controls suchas a detailed scrutiny and examination of a random sample of purchases.Whatever method of control is used, care is taken to ensure that the goods to be purchased do not include substantial items of capital equipment forwhich a fuller appraisal is required.(ii) Debt relief16. This is an exceptional form of development assistance. Aid isoccasionally used for this purpose but each case is carefully considered onits merits. Such aid increases the amount of foreign exchange availableto the debtor (assuming of course that without the relief the debt wouldhave been paid). But its developmental value depends on the way in whichthese additional resources are then used by the recipient country; there isno donor control over its use.17. The use of U.K. aid to provide debt relief in certain exceptional cases normally relates only to aid debt. Commercial debt is governed by commercial considerations and criteria. Many of the poorest and mostneedy of the developing countries do not have a heavy debt servicing burden(because their aid is provided on highly concessional terms and they havenot been able to accumulate heavy commercial debts) and it is important to look at the individual circumstances of each developing country and totailor the type of assistance given to the particular needs.TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR MANPOWER AIDIts objectives18. The main purpose of technical assistance or manpower aid shouldnot just be the plugging of immediate manpower gaps but the building upof local capabilities. This in the end should enable individual countries tobecome self-sufficient so that they no longer need such aid save in the moreesoteric skills.19. In order to achieve this objective the administration of technical assistance or manpower aid has been changing in recent years, at leastso far as the U.K. programme is concerned. Originally, virtually all U.K.technical assistance was requested and supplied on an ad hoc basis. while there will always be a need for some ad hoc provisions, there has been a steady trend towards the planning and co-ordination of U.K. technical assistance programmes for developing countries individually. This planning and co-ordination involves not only the technical assistance programmeswithin O.D.M.&apos;s direct control but also the programmes of other Britishorganisations concerned directly or indirectly with aid, such as the british council, the Inter-University Council or the British Volunteers Programme.This change has coincided with similar moves by other suppliers of tech-nical assistance (e.g. the U.N.D.P. Country Programmes) and with efforts in many developing countries to plan and co-ordinate their manpower,including that part of their manpower requirement which must be met fromexternal sources.
20. The need for careful planning and co-ordination of manpower aidhas thus come to be recognised by both donors and recipients. With man-power aid or technical assistance, there is no simple market test as thereis with project aid, especially where the posts in question are in the public sector. Typically, the central authorities in the developing country (orthe donor agency) will be faced with demands for technical assistance inexcess of the funds available, most of which may be at first sight fairlyequally worthy of support. Unless there is a co-ordinated plan of prioritiesagainst which the requests can be assessed, the mix of technical assistanceprovided will be arbitrary. As a result technical assistance may be providedfor low priority activities while more important projects will be neglected.Skilled manpower, including technical assistance, is a scarce resource for most developing countries, particularly when there is, as there seems to be,a diminishing number of people willing to work overseas. Without planning,the resource will be used inefficiently and wasted: even with it somewastage is unavoidable. The planning of technical assistance to reducewastage to the minimum, is thus of the first priority for both recipient anddonor.21. When a developing country has its own co-ordinated plan of man-power priorities we try to build on these for our technical assistanceplanning by (a) carrying out regular manpower reviews to examine in close consultation with the local government all their technical assistance needs and arrangements; (b) visits of professional advisers, either from london or from a Development Division. Similar visits are of course made to countries without a detailed manpower plan, but where a local plan islacking there are severe constraints on the extent to which technical assistance can be programmed; (c) in the particular case of training, drawing up a mutually agreed training programme with the recipient governmentand relating this to the progressive reduction of their requirements ofexpatriate officers, initially at least in the less specialist functions. We aregradually extending this technique to more and more countries; we believethat it is a good method of improving the effectiveness of training provided under the aid programme, since it helps ensure that the types and quantitiesof training provided are matched to the recipients development priorities.22. This paper is not the place to discuss the detailed techniques of technical assistance planning, but clearly the setting of priorities for technical assistance and manpower aid generally should as far as possiblecomplement the priorities set for financial aid. Thus as we increasinglychange the character and form of our financial aid programmes to ensurethat we provide more help for the poorest countries and the poorest people in those countries, so we are re-examining the various forms of technical assistance which we provide such as supplementation schemes, theprovision of consultants and advisers, help with training programmes,research etc. to ensure that they also reflect this new emphasis.23. At the same time improved programming at the country level isbeing accompanied by more careful appraisal of individual activities,emphasising particularly much closer definition of objectives, co-ordination
of inputs, regular reviews of outcomes, and set termination dates. Thenew aid policy, the more positive approach to identifying technical assist-ance requirements, the emphasis on co-ordination and planning at activity and country level, and the rapid disappearance of situations of grossmanpower dependence; all are leading to the growth of the project form in technical assistance, and the decline of the programme form and notions ofgeneral &quot;under-pinning&quot; whether in assistance to universities or insupplementation and training activities.(a) Supplementation schemes24. These are schemes under which the British Government supplementson behalf of certain governments the salaries and allowances paid to british staff employed by governments, universities and other institutions inoperational posts in developing countries. At present there are about 7,000people whose salaries are supplemented under various schemes (although we would have been willing to supply more if they could have been recruited). This number is expected to decline steadily as these people are replaced by local staff.25. All current scheme agreements expire at the end of March 1976.During 1975 arrangements are being negotiated with each country for thepost March 1976 period. Consideration will be given to increasingassistance to the poorer countries if the need can be established; the richercountries will be expected to make a larger contribution of their own.Following a review of the supplementation schemes various improvements have been made to terms of service which should increase the chance of recruiting and retaining expatriate operational staff. One of the biggesthindrances to overseas contract employment is the fear of job insecurityon return to the U.K. We are examining the possibility of extending theHome Base scheme to help counteract this. Another aid to recruitmenthas been the calculation of supplements to salaries and emolumentscalculated on a U.K.-related basis, ie U.K. notional salary plus employeesshare of superannuation, inducement, cost of living minus local emoluments,instead of on a local salary plus cost of living basis; rates are reviewedannually. All supplemented staff are now paid on this basis. In some countries where very few expatriates are employed in the Public service it may be possible to reach agreement whereby O.D.M. employs the officersand seconds them for service with the government concerned (which would normally refund the equivalent of the local salary to O.D.M.). A major problem in relation to all overseas appointments is often the securing of proper accommodation overseas and while O.D.M. does all it can in con-junction with the overseas governments to secure adequate housing theneed for the pioneering spirit has not wholly disappeared.(b) Use of consultants26. British consultants through their work overseas, both commerciallyand under aid arrangements, continue to play an important part in helping&apos;The Home Base Scheme provides for Government Departments and other bodiesto take on supernumerary staff on the understanding that an equivalent number of people from the Department will be seconded to work overseas under O.D.M. auspices.
to formulate development programmes and projects. In 1974 total officialexpenditure on technical assistance in respect of the services of consultantsand other organisations in undertaking feasibility and other pre-investmentinvestigations, and in the provision of other kinds of management,operational and advisory services, was  5-2 million. 104 new feasibility andpre-investment studies were commissioned during the year.27. To see what changes, if any, there needed to be in the role of Britishconsultants to enable them to play their full part in the new aid strategy,and particularly in promoting rural development, the Ministry of overseas development held a one-day conference with British consultants in October1974 to discuss ways in which they might help.28. It was recognised that there are no ready made answers and that it takes time and many different professional skills to find solutions appro-priate to the communities we are seeking to help. But it became clear that many British consultancy firms can and were willing to play their part by putting together multi-purpose teams to meet the particular requirementsof a given situation, with the added advantage of the professional assistance and back-up which the firms&apos; U.K. base can offer.(c) Training programmes29. About 8,000 students and trainees from developing countries cometo Britain each year under U.K. technical assistance programmes. Butthere has been growing concern about the relevance of training in developed-country institutions to students from developing countries. By and largethe courses available in U.K. universities, etc. are based on the problems,institutions and conditions of British society. For example, the trainingof engineers in the U.K. and in other developed countries is carried onagainst the background that the engineer, once qualified, will have at his disposal a variety of supporting services a highly skilled work-force, a wide choice of sophisticated machinery, etc. which is not available in mostdeveloping countries. Similarly, the engineer will be taught (even if not specifically) that efficiency depends on economising in the use of labourand raw materials, rather than of capital equipment once again an in-appropriate attitude for engineers working in many developing countries.Similar considerations apply in many other fields: medicine is an obviousexample.30. This is no easy problem. It is not confined merely to the institutions in the developed countries, but through their influence on research output,text-book writing, etc. similar attitudes spread to the developing countries&apos;own institutions. One way of providing more appropriate training is theprovision of courses specifically designed for students from developing countries. The U.K. provides &quot;tailor-made&quot; courses in some fields, eg the institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex covers a range of subjects of social and economic importance to the poorest developing countries and several other universities have special courses. They dependfor their success however on the availability of U.K. staff capable of teachingon them, and on an adequate demand from developing countries to makeit worthwhile to run them. The most widely known example of this form
of training has been the pattern of arrangements made with a number of u.K. universities and colleges under the auspices of the CommonwealthEducation Fellowships Schemes enabling them to provide courses in education specifically geared to the needs of the developing countries andstaffed accordingly.31. In line with our new aid strategy, increasing attention will be paidto the establishment of suitable courses in the U.K. for those from the developing countries who need training, not available in their own countries,in fields related to poverty oriented programmes such as rural development.At the same time more will be done to identify the help which the U.K.can provide in promoting or assisting suitable training courses in these fields in the developing countries.32. As our new aid strategy is likely to put new calls on both our internal and external sources of expertise, particularly in the field of rural develop-ment, at a time when such expertise is no longer being replenished fromthe Colonial Overseas Services, we are also considering what steps we need to take to train new UK. specialists in overseas work.(d) Research33. &quot;Research and Development&quot; has been one of the most rapidly growing areas of U.K. technical assistance expenditure in recent years andin 1974 we spent  5-lm on this. Increasing emphasis is being given to research into appropriate technology, both on the industrial and agriculturalside (eg the work at the University of Strathclyde, the research anddevelopment being carried out in the Tropical Products Institute and other.D.M.-funded bodies referred to in Annex III). These forms of researchtogether with, for example, medical research which is giving a specialemphasis to nutritional problems, and research on road construction andtransport planning for rural areas should make an important contributionto the new emphasis in the aid programme on rural development and animprovement in the quality of life at the poorest level.ON-GOING AND EX-POST EVALUATION OF BRITISH BILATERALAID34. During the last year or two the O.D.M., together with most otherdonors and U.N. agencies, has begun to devote more attention to the ex-postevaluation of projects already carried out in the past, and to reviews of on-going projects, to see what lessons can be learned. There is now a growing number of projects and aid programmes that have been runningfor a sufficiently long time for evaluation to be meaningful and the O.D.M.is currently spending about  100,000 per annum on ex-post evaluation work.35. There are two main areas for such work, capital aid and technical assistance, and the techniques used differ. For capital aid, the problem is relatively simple in that there is usually something tangible to look at and some quantifiable costs and benefits, even though there may also be substantial unquantifiable elements such as the benefits of a school orhospital. In the case of technical assistance, however, the problems are far more difficult. Here the benefits will normally take the initial form of improvements in people&apos;s skills or mental abilities, leading, it is hoped,
to changes in organisational behaviour, and it may be very difficult toquantify the results in any meaningful way. Furthermore, programmestend to be of a continuing rather than a once-and-for-all nature. For thosevery reasons, however, it is especially important to try to make some assess-ment of the success or otherwise of technical assistance programmes andfor this purpose survey techniques of various kinds are being evolved.36. Ex-post evaluation work is best conducted in close co-operation withthe recipient country, partly because their full approval is needed foraccess to the project in any case, partly because full co-operation will ensure&quot;instant feedback&quot; of any lessons that can be learned, and partly because it is in both parties&apos; interests that the recipients own evaluation capabilitiesare developed. After all, once the project has been implemented it is the developing country itself that is responsible for its future success and there-fore has the priority need to learn whatever lessons are to be learned fromthe evaluation. The O.D.M.S interest is primarily in trying to improve the effectiveness of its future aid procedures.
ANNEX iii the ORGANISATION OF THE BRITISH AID MACHINERY1. The Ministry of Overseas Development (O.D.M.) was first set up asa separate Ministry by a Labour Government in October, 1964. It brought together the technical assistance functions of the former Department of technical Co-operation and the overseas aid policy functions of the Foreign,Commonwealth Relations and Colonial Offices and of other Departments.In November, 1970 as part of a reorganisation of central government, theMinister&apos;s functions were formally transferred to the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Ministry became the overseas development Administration of the F.C.O. under a Minister exercisingdelegated powers. In 1974 the new Labour Government reconstituted O.D.M.once more as a separate Ministry with its own Minister. As a result of the ministerial changes in June, 1975, the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs exercises overall responsibility as Minister of overseas Development. Mr. Prentice, who retains his seat in the Cabinet,has been appointed Minister of State within the Foreign and commonwealth office with responsibility for overseas development. He is in charge of theMinistry of Overseas Development which remains a separate Ministry.2. O.D.M. is staffed by home civil servants, although occasionally mem-bers of the diplomatic service work there on secondment. The senior manage-ment includes the Permanent Secretary and three Deputy Secretaries, oneof whom is the Director General of Economic Planning. The UnderSecretaries include senior advisers in Natural Resources, Education andMedicine. O.D.M. is organised both on geographical and on functional lines.There are 12 departments each covering a specific geographical area. Onthe functional side there are some 20 other administrative departments;there is also the Economic Planning Staff which is divided into three departments, International, Geographical and Statistics; and there is the professional advisory staff, consisting for the main disciplines of advisorygroups under a Chief Adviser, while for others there are one or twoAdvisers. All these elements work closely together in whatever combinationsare necessary to deal with particular questions.Aid administration overseas3. Contact between O.D.M. and the developing countries is reinforced bythe U.K. diplomatic missions, which are responsible for the administrationof the British aid programme in the countries to which they are accredited.In those developing countries in which there is a large British aid programme, (eg India, Kenya) there are normally one or more members ofthe mission with full-time aid management duties. There are about 30 suchposts, about half of which are filled by O.D.M. personnel on secondmentto the Diplomatic Service. In all cases responsibility for the local handling
of O.D.M.&apos;s relations with the government concerned lies with the Headof Mission.4. O.D.M. maintains 5 regional development divisions overseas, in Bridge-town, Barbados for the Caribbean; Beirut for the Middle East; Bangkokfor South East Asia; Blantyre for Central and Southern Africa; and Nairobifor East Africa. The main purpose of each development division is toadvise and assist, within its area of operations, the Heads of Britishdiplomatic Missions in independent countries and, where applicable, thegovernments of West Indian Associated States and British Dependencies,in the planning and execution of aid programmes in their countries, andin the exercise of such financial authority (varying between  100,000 and 400,000) to approve capital aid projects as is delegated to the Head of mission. The development divisions, each with a Head (of assistant secretary rank) and a team of specialist advisers representing the disciplinesmost relevant to the area, are primarily advisory to the Heads of Mission,but they may also be made available to meet requests by the governmentsconcerned for professional advice; and they advise O.D.M. generally on the professional aspects of financial aid and technical assistance in their areas.5. These development divisions, three of which were not fully establisheduntil 1973, are in effect out-stations of O.D.M. Their establishment hasresulted in a significant decentralisation of much of O.D.M.&apos;s workparticularly on project identification and appraisal. There is increasingbenefit from the existence of multi-disciplinary staff of the developmentdivisions, with the opportunities which they have of keeping in contact with the development problems of the countries with which they areconcerned.The scientific and technical units of O.D.M.6. Specialised services are provided in the U.K. and in the developing countries by the scientific and technical units of O.D.M.; the TropicalProducts Institute, Centre for Overseas Pest Research, Directorate of overseas Surveys, Land Resources Division, and Population Bureau.Unlike the headquarters departments and the development divisions (whichare financed under a separate Aid Administration Vote) the scientific units are financed from the Overseas Aid Vote ie the aid programme itself.7. The primary concern of the Tropical Products Institute (T.P.I.) ishelping developing countries to make better use of their renewable plant and animal resources particularly for food purposes. The Institutespecialises in the various scientific, technological and economic problems which arise after the &apos;crop&apos; has been harvested. T.P.I. gives advice and carriesout research on processing, presentation and storage of these products, aswell as on marketing and the use of by-products. The guiding principle inits development work is to aim for the best type of equipment, level of labourintensity or mechanisation, scale of operation, cost and so on to suit local circumstances. As an example, T.P.I.&apos;s work on the storage of cassava hasshown that it is possible to construct clamps from earth and straw whichcan maintain this perishable commodity in good condition for up to threemonths.
8. Of course, no amount of effort put into improved processing and marketing of products will yield best results unless the initial resource isof top quality. This is where the Centre for Overseas Pest Research(C.O.P.R.) can help, with advice and research in the field of pre-harvest pestcontrol. The stark figures of the cost of damage caused by plant diseases,weeds and insect pests each year  30- 40,000 million demonstrate theimportance of C.O.P.R.&apos;s activities in the agricultural field. But control ofpests which otherwise reduce the quality of plant and animal products isonly one aspect of C.O.P.R.&apos;s work; it is also concerned with certain disease-carrying pests which affect public health. For example, C.O.P.R. is collabor-ating with the World Health Organisation in a major scheme to controlriver blindness (onchocerciasis) in the Volta River Basin in West Africa.9. The Directorate of Overseas Surveys and the Land Resources Division(L.R.D.) both concern themselves with land potential. The former assistsdeveloping countries in the basic surveying and mapping of land which isessential for development planning. Working closely with local surveydepartments, the Directorate carries out field surveys and mapping for specific projects, including arranging air photography contracts when required. L.R.D.&apos;s role is to help developing countries make the best possible use of both existing exploited land and areas which hitherto have notbeen opened up. It does this by making an appraisal of land resourcepotential and then suggesting the best use of such resources for the develop-ment of agriculture, livestock, husbandry and forestry. Equally important asactually doing the job themselves is the way in which both these scientificunits help build up local capabilities and resources by giving technicaladvice, making experts available to work with and teach local counterpartstaff, and by providing training facilities.10. The Population Bureau, which maintains close collaboration with theInternational Planned Parenthood Federation, acts as a centre in Britainwhere a body of knowledge and experience in the promotion and imple-mentation of family planning programmes overseas is being built up. Itdoes not merely deal with the techniques of family planning, but takes amuch broader view of the population problem covering its medical, social and demographic aspects. Its staff make advisory visits to developing countries, organise research projects in Britain and overseas, and assist withtraining including the promotion of courses for students from developing countries.Support for related agencies11. O.D.M. finances or contributes to the finances of a number of tech-nical, scientific and educational organisations whose services, research and advice, are available as technical assistance to developing countries. they include the overseas divisions or units of the Building Research Station, Insti-tute of Geological Sciences, the Road Research Laboratory, the Common-wealth Forestry Institute and the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine.O.D.M. also provides grants-in-aid to the Technical Education and training organisation for Overseas Countries and the Inter-University Council for higher Education Overseas.
12. The Commonwealth Development Corporation (C.D.C.) is anotherorganisation associated with O.D.M., and its Chairman and Board are appointed by the Minister of Overseas Development. It was set up by act of Parliament in 1948 to encourage and support economic development inthe countries in which it operates (and since 1969 this includes non-Commonwealth countries as well); at the same time it has to pay its way,taking one year with another. Most of its capital is borrowed from Govern-ment, within the aid programme, and other funds are generated internally.Although C.D.C. has a number of wholly-owned projects, it more ofteninvests in partnership with others overseas governments, international and national development agencies, British and foreign financial institutions,the general public overseas, and so on. Its present investments in variedprojects covering public utilities and housing, primary production, and commercial and industrial undertakings, total some  200 million in morethan 40 countries.13.
