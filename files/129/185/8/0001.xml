DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 10827 October 1975INNER CITY AREASNote by the Secretary of the cabinet when the Cabinet discussed public expenditure priorities at its meetingon 4 August last (CC(75) 39th Conclusions), the Prime Minister, in his summing up, said that high priority should be accorded to dealing withthe problems of inner city areas.    Subsequently the task of consideringnow this might be implemented was assigned to the Department of the environment, who have chaired a working group of officials.    A final report from the group will not be available until the end of the year;but in view of the forthcoming consideration by Cabinet of public expenditure questions, in the course of which decisions will have to betaken which will involve taking a view on the priority to be given toinner city areas, they have produced an interim report to provideMinisters with a background assessment of the problems and theirrelationship to public expenditure issues.    This interim report istherefore attached for the information of Ministers.COPY NO81CABINETSigned   JOHN hunt cabinet Office24 October 1975
INNER CITY AREASINTERIM REPORT BY INTERDEPARTMENTAL GROUP OP OFFICIALSINTRODUCTION1      Following the Chequers Cabinet meeting on     h Augustwe were instructed as a group of officials from all the SocialDepartments to report on the problems of Inner City Areas.    TheDepartments which have taken part in the work are listed in the Annex.2      We have produced urgently this interim report so that it maybe available to Ministers during the current consideration of thePublic Expenditure Survey 1975.    It is in two parts.    The firstseeks to summarise what can be said now on the basis of work already done.   The second tries to relate this to current public expenditureissues.   The group will produce their final report before the end ofthe year.    In it they hope to set out for Ministers&apos; considerationpossible lines for t he development of policy.3      During 1976 and early 1977, the Government will be receiving the final reports on the 3 Inner Area Studies of the Departmentof the Environment, interim research reports on several comprehensivearea schemes in Scotland, and a stream of reports from the CommunityDevelopment Projects of the Home Office.    The group1s final report may assist the Government in making a positive response to these.PART ITHE PROBLEMh      It is assumed that Ministers have in mind a general concern about urban areas, particularly in the major cities, characterised bymultiple problems - poor and obsolescent housing, overcrowding, hadenvironment, high unemployment and very low earnings.    This is, ofcourse, a general and long-standing concern, but the formulation of effective policies requires closer definition.   For this it ishelpful to distinguish:-a)        individual or family problems of poverty ordeprivation;1
CONPI  DENTIALb) area problems of concentration of the pooror deprived.And there is a further distinction between long-term action addres;to deep-seated problems and short-run ameliorative measures.5       In the last century, concern for the deprived or disadvantage:meant concern for the poor, and, during a period of massive migratito the towns, especially for the urban poor.    Prom this arose majorprogrammes of public health measures, concurrently with national sj:terns of compulsory education and regulation of conditions of work,and the beginnings of slum clearance.   The beginning of this cen-tury added compulsory insurance systems.    The post-war period brouglin the universal social security and health systems, a comprehenshurban planning system, and major extensions of the public role in Iing.   Throughout, the general assumption has been of separable protlems effectively catered for through separate policies and program::6      Of late three separate strands of concern have developed:-a) for the persistence of poverty - at leastrelative - of a minority;b) for the particular problems of identified,different groups (the elderly, poor single-parent families, the disabled, and handicapped,the disadvantaged coloured);c) for spatial concentrations of the poor ordeprived.7 The first concern, for the persistence of poverty, is bound up with national policies of redistribution, through taxation, incomes policy, and social security systems, and raises issues eg of means-testing and of take-up of benefits. This concern may be fundamentalto inner areas&apos; problems but it is outside the remit of the group and is being considered elsewhere.8       The second concern, for the problems of particular groups,towards more discriminating and specialised measures for particular&quot;client groups&apos; of individuals or families - party through cash benefits but mainly through the provision of specialised services.2
$      The third strand of concern, for spatial concentrations ofthe poor or deprived is the main interest of this report.    The funda-mental issue is how far this approach should he pursued separately,in addition to the other two0RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN AREA BASED POLICIES10     Since the mid-60s one element of housing policy has increasinglyaimed to raise the standards of homes and environment in small areas.There are now General Improvement Areas, to improve to a good long-term standard; Housing Action Areas where action consistent with the short-life of the property is taken to combat poor housing conditions and housing stress; and provision for Priority Neighbourhoods where local authorities try to hold the position pending more positivemeasures.   These successive housing policy instruments have beenboth more selective geographically and more concerned with widersocial needs.11     In Education successive Advisory Committee Reports since theWar, eg the Newsom Report &quot;Half Our Future&quot;, have drawn attention tothose who suffer educational disadvantage.    The Plov/den Report in1966 looked beyond educational provision to the social background of primary school children and advocated &quot;positive discrimination&quot; towardsareas where old schools served children of poor families living inrun-down housing.   Many of the slum schools of the kind described inthe Plov/den Report are of course in the inner cities.    Educationalpriority areas as such have not been designated but special needsidentified by local authorities have received priority in educationalbuilding programmes and in the allocation of teacher quotas.   Since1968 &quot;social priority&quot; schools have been identified where teachersreceive allowances in addition to their salaries.   Positive discrimination -nation in favour of areas of urban deprivation does not depend solely on capital expenditure and the deployment of teaching staff; localeducation authorities can make considerable use of their discretion to discriminate for example in the employment of ancillary staff andin the provision of special equipment.12    Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966 provides for grants&quot;by the Home Secretary towards the extra cost incurred by local3
authorities in connection with the presence of substantial numbersof Commonwealth Immigrants in their areas.    Total grant-earningexpenditure in 197h/75 was about  13.UM and much of it will havebeen on staff employed in inner areas, where many commonwealth immigrants live.   Most of this expenditure has been on additionaleducational staff.13     In 1969 the Government introduced the Urban Programme adminjs-tered by the Home Office.   Unlike the developments in housing oreducation, this is outside all existing programmes, taking as itsstarting point the recognition of local authorities with areas of&quot;Special social need&quot; (especially, to start with, problems of race relations).   It is a programme of specific grant towards capital costs or the initial years of revenue expenditure on pioneering orsupplementing projects by local authorities or voluntary groups.It is a small programme.    Total expenditure in Gt Britain authorised in its first k yrs was  20 -  25M.1h.    As a separate venture the Home Office launched the CommunityDevelopment Project which sought to study deprivation in. 12 smallareas, using action and research teams to involve the community tothe maximum possible extent in identifying their needs and findingways of meeting them.   More recently the Urban Deprivation Unit was set up in the Home Office.   As a result of their work,in mid-197Uthe Home Secretary announced proposals for trials of Compreh ensiveCommunity Programmes, an administrative device to help central andlocal government work together in developing more effective measuresto help the deprived.15     Meanwhile, the DoE had launched its three studies of inner cityproblems in Liverpool, Birmingham and Lambeth, now entering their final phase.    In late 197h- the DoE undertook to support a series of&quot;neighbourhood management1 initiatives by local authorities - adminis-trative devices for local authorities to co-ordinate their policiestowards particular parts of their areas.16 Within the Departments of the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Urban Policy Group has for over 2 yrs considered urban problemsh
across the whole span of Scottish Office policy interest.   more recently, the Urban Renewal Unit has been established under theGroup, with the specific tasks of advising on and developingco-ordinated urban policies in Scotland, and of providing corporateadvice and assistance to local authorities.   The Unit, which is asmall co-ordinating Unit working across Departmental boundaries,has been largely occupied since its inception with the problems ofthe Glasgow area, but is fostering a number of comprehensive area-based local authority initiatives there and elsewhere to tackleconcentrations of deprivation.17    Although the employment and training services provided by the manpower Services Commission are provided on an area basis largely by or through local offices, and although some of them are tailoredto meet the needs of individuals who are members of particular dis-advantaged groups (eg employment services for disabled people andlinglish language training courses for immigrants and others) theservices do not specifically give priority to local needs of thoseliving in the inner areas.Two Government financed schemes in the employment field are operated on an area basis.    The Community Industry scheme launched in 1972to help young people to hold down a stable job, operates mainly inthe traditional unemployment black spots such as Glasgow, liverpool and Wearside but also has units in London and the West Midlands.Nevertheless, although some young people in the inner areas have undoubtedly benefited from Community Industry, the scheme is primarilyangled towards meeting the needs of disadvantaged young people ratherthan being specifically concerned with tackling the problems associatedwith the inner areas.    The job creation programme (formally knownas the work creation scheme) being directed by the Manpower services commission which is intended to mitigate the worst effects of highcyclical unemployment is however devoting special attention to theproblems of the inner areas and the needs of special groups such asschool leavers and young people.HOW CONCENTRATED ISJDEPRIVATION?18    This brief review of present area based policies shows notonly the extent of concern with spatial problems but also the lack5
CON PI  DENTIALof definition of inner areas as such or of multiple deprivation.The Group therefore looked at recent research in this field andcommissioned further work on deprivation indicators and the extentof concentration in geographical areas.    This work shows that whilstconcentrations of various measures of deprivation are obviouslyfound more in manor cities than elsewhere some forms of deprivationare much more concentrated than others and combinations of indicator;do not point to easily definable areas of multiple deprivation.19     The highest concentration found is that of New commonwealth immigrants, and these tend to be in areas of poor housing and relatively high unemployment.   More generally, there is quite a high degree of concentration of poor housing; but unemployment is more widely spread.    Other social indicators show different patterns of distribution.20     Except in the case of commonwealth immigrants, priority or&apos;worst&apos; areas selected at any level of analysis would include onlya minority of those in the population suffering from the disadvan-tage examined, and the population of these priority areas would ingeneral have a majority of people not suffering from that disadvan-tage (though they may suffer from the fact of living in such an areathrough poorer public services and stigma).21     Major issues have been thrown up by this analysis whose resolu-tion is crucial to the development of policy in this field.    Theyare as follows:-i) Is the spatial concentration of different aspectsof deprivation something which itself warrantsa special discrimination eg because the variousdisadvantages are thought to be mutually reinfor-.influencing if concentrated?ii) If so, what weight is to be given to different forms of disadvantage in selecting areas forspecial discrimination?   Differemt   combinationsof social indicators will lead to different areas, and analysis of small areas will givedifferent results from analysis based on localauthority areas,confidential
iii) How much discrimination is warranted, given that any selection will depend on an arbi-trary judgement distinguishing a relatively few had areas from a good &quot;many more whichare little better.iv) Is the objective of policy to secure ashort-term reduction in some deficiencies in some areas, or to secure long-termimprovements in the living conditions andlite-chances of the poor?The Group hope in their further report to set out these issues more fully for Ministers&apos; consideration.FIRST LESSONS22    At this stage the Group believes that the following generallessons can be drawn from the s tudies and analyses so far.23    Not all concentrations of poverty and deprivation are to befound in the inner cities.    Physical quality of the housing aside,some local authority estates, even post-war ones, have at least as great a concentration with dirept implications for public investment .In Glasgow, there are more people in such estates than in the problemareas in the inner city.    Knowsley in Lancashire displays a similarhigh concentration.   Most types of deprivation also occur outside the inner cities and indeed outside cities altogether.2k    There is not a single set of problems even in inner areas.    inner london has major problems and so has Glasgow, but they are not thesame, Glasgow has a far higher percentage of unemployed and it tends to have more severe and concentrated problems of bad housing andenvironment.   London has overcrowding on a unique scale and majorconcentrations of commonwealth immigrants.   Some &quot;inner cities1 havesubstantial populations - perhaps 300,000 in Liverpool - 2-3 million in London - (though the extent to which the whole inner city sufferspoverty or deprivation varies from each to each) but smaller innercity areas exist elsewhere.7
The features common to the inner city areas are:-a) they contain concentrations of problems, but notidentical sets, and while many people are at aserious disadvantage the majority of individuals and families will not be;b) the inner cities are areas of substantial declinein population, and there is good reason to regard the population movement as differential; it doesnothing to reduce the concentrations of poor,disadvantaged and feckless;c) they are areas of substantial decline in jobs, anddisplay pockets of high unemployment and low income;d) they are areas of obsolescent housing and, wherethe housing has been replaced, it will have been by local authority building.25     Concentrations of certain kinds of deprivation exist, therefore,but it would be dangerous to assume that a general policy could &quot;be constructed of identifying the worst areas and then mounting anattack through special programmes.   While this approach is useful for specific programmes directed to limited ends such as slum cleara:and housing improvement it is not suitable for general applicationto deprivation,which is more scattered.   Moreover, it is by no means certain that substantial extra expenditures within the areas would Ifeffective.    The commitment of local authorities would be vital and cannot necessarily be assumed.    In the United States, successivemajor special programmes have had limited success.    The main pro-grammes of Government must therefore play the major role of securingchanges.    They are the established instruments of Government action,It is through these programmes that the bulk of resources are, andwill continue to be, channelled.8

C ONPIDEN TI AL26    At &quot;both central and local government level, it is generallydifficult to make substantial quick adjustments to the main programmes to meet the needs of particular small areas.    But main programmes canchange and develop, at times quite rapidly, in response to clear evidence of need and to strong political willo    They are used tobalancing different priorities between competing groups within overallconstraints.    They can and do apply priorities which reflect relativeneeds.    Some could, subject to the constraints of expenditure limits and acceptability, apply a &quot;positive discrimination&apos;.27    It also has to be recognised that co-ordination of main pro-grammes and objectives is also extremely difficult, but there are nowmoves at all levels of Government to help adjustment of these main programmes.    In Central Government the first steps have been taken towards a joint approach to social policy.    Many local authorities are well advanced into corporate planning although often it is stillrudimentary below chief officer level.    Several local authorities,with DoE support, are about to experiment with neighbourhood manage-ment (para 15).   And trials are being worked up of ComprehensiveCommunity Programmes (as proposed by the Home Office - para 1h).What the main programmes of central Government generally cannot do isensure discrimination by local authorities towards particular partsof their areas, or secure action which local authorities are unwil-ling to take.    Comprehensive Community Programmes have been proposedpartly to overcome this difficulty and give Central Government anentry to local government decision-taking processes.28    A good deal extra can and is being done in the inner areas by local authorities - local measures to provide play space, improve the environment, encourage school/community relations, add to infor-mation services.    Some of this innovation springs from the EPA experi-ments and the Urban Programme. . The. progressive localauthorities are not short of ideas for spending/u^%?&amp;lly in suchways.There are also resources within the communitywhich can be released   . by modest public help.9
29     The case for special supplementary programmes (like the urban Programme) is that while small scale, they can, if so directsa) encourage innovation which will lead toadaptation of the main programmes;b) encourage discrimination by local authori-ties towards special problems, or coordi-nation of their various actions towards these problems;c) unlock community initiatives.The Urban Programme, has always in England and Wales been directed to (a) and (c) and in Scotland it is now directed to (b).IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY30     In the light of this review the following general points emerga) The MAIN benefit to the inner city will besecured by the progressive adaptation of themain programmes;b) This may require co-ordination and redirec-tion of central government programmes as wellas closer links between central and localgovernment.    (The Scottish Office have already made some moves in this direction);c) There is room for initiatives to find new systems of administration eg in relation to localauthority management or central/local relation-ships but these are difficult;d) There is some room for special supplementary programmesparticularly if used as suggested in para 29 butthey are not the whole answer.10
PART IIPUBLIC EXPENDITURE31     This part sets out what can be said, in the absence of asettled definition of the inner areas, about the effects on those areas of current public expenditure proposals.   References are to part Two of the 1975 Public Expenditure Survey Committee Report:&quot;Public Expenditure to 1979-80&quot;.32    Because this part is addressed to public expenditure, it ignorespolicy fields (organisation, planning, housing management, industriallocation policy) which in one way or another may be important toinner city problems.   Because there is no settled definition ofinner city areas or of the way particular programmes relate to theirproblems, it is in good part based on judgement.LOCAL AUTHORITIES CURRENT EXPENDITURE (SPECIAL ANALYSIS 1):33    Most of the relevant programmes are local authority onessupported through the Rate Support Grant (RSG).    In England and wales the RSG total in 1975/76 (at November 1974 prices) is  h,705M.   ForScotland the corresponding total is  555M.   The grant distributionhas over recent years increasingly reflected through the needselement the kinds of needs which are typically concentrated in innercity areas.   So it provides a substantial differential in the dis-tribution of grant in favour of local authorities of those areas.(The needs element is paid to London Boroughs and MetropolitanDistricts; elsewhere in England and Wales to Counties. InScotland by far the greater part of the needs element goes to the regions so that Glasgow, for example, with its severe concentration of deprived housing, receives only moderate benefit from it.)    Localauthorities decide their own priorities for expenditure.   Thegeneral restriction on total local authority spending and manpowerwill no doubt inhibit any &apos;positive discrimination1 by localauthorities towards parts of their areas, may put at risk some ofthe supplementary ameliorative spending described in paragraph 29and could itself limit the development of capital projects for innercity areas.
CON FIDENTIALLOCAL AUTHORITY CAPITAL EXPENDITURE34     Capital programmes, other than housing ones, which seem mostrelevant are (as in the PES Report).  million at 1975 Survey Prices1975-76    1976-77    1977-78    1978-79   1979-:GREAT BRITAINImprovement of the environment and localfacilities* 333.1        253.4        256.4        239.6      215Personal social services 113.9 82.6 56.1 2+4.1        MSchools: capitalexpenditure on primarysecondary and otherschools 384.8        367.4        285.9        233.7      217,]*In England and Wales, most of this falls within the locally determined Sector.35     The reduced provisions for improvement of local facilitieswill limit the scope for comprehensive measures to alleviate urbandeprivation and prevent improvement in areas of bad environment.In the distribution in 1976/77 of the-Locally Determined Sector inEngland and Wales (Special Analysis 2), (para 2) the priorityannounced to the local authority associations is to shield the allocations to areas containing new and expanding towns.   even with the reduced provision, the national and local priorities for personal social service facilities (Section 11) are directed to neei:which tend to be concentrated in poorer urban areas.   The small size of the sums available for replacement and improvement of old schools&quot;would bear especially harshly on urban areas&quot; (Section 10, para %The greater part of the programme goes to new schools to meetincreases in child population - generally outside inner areas;Mis not possible to divert resources on any significant scale rroilining for new population to improvement or replacement becauseof the need to provide a school place for every child.   expenditure cuts will therefore be felt directly in schools with sub-standardacc ommodat i on.i36     It seems clear that the major reductions in all these programmes (partly to give some shield to revenue expenditure) mustbe cutting deeply into provisions for needs of high priority, andmust very greatly inhibit any possibility either of positive discri*mination towards inner city areas or of co-ordinated programmes ofimprovement.
CONFIDE N T I A LHOUSING37     A number of housing expenditure programmes are of directrelevance to the needs of inner city areas, particularly those concerned with house improvement grants, council house improvements,municlpalisation, local authority lending for both house purchase and improvement, housing association investment in new building and improvement, environmental schemes in housing areas and slum clearance.    It is from these programmes in particular that resources are drawn to finance housing action areas (first introduced in1975/76) which comprise mainly urban neighbourhoods of some 200-300houses within which local authorities are encouraged to tackle theamelioration of poor physical conditions and social stress.   DoE isgiving these areas priority under the various expenditure programmeslisted above and, although each of those programmes aims to meetneeds beyond those arising in the city cores, it is intended that -subject to the outcome of the housing Finance Review - there shouldhe a steady concentration of effort upon stress areas.    (In wales the greater part of this expenditure goes on renovating housing insmaller communities such as the small coal mining towns).     TheGreat Britain provision for these related programmes in the 1975 PESReport (Section 7) is as follows:-  million at 1975 Survey Prices1975-76        1976-77       1977-78        1978-79        1979-801367 1380 1i444 1446 147838     In addition, it must be emphasised that the new public-sectorhouse-building programme is not subject to any overall quantitativecontrol.   Local authorities are encouraged to continue building to meet their housing needs, and much of the new dwellings thusproduced in the major conurbations and elsewhere (eg New Towns)will benefit inner area households.   The relevant estimates of publiexpenditure in the 1975 PES Report for new house building by thepublic sector   in Great Britain are:  million at 1975 Survey Prices1975-76        1976-77       1977-78        1978-79        1979-801492 141+2 1470 1489 1495
SPECIAL PROGRAMMEShO There are three cases where on explicit bias towards particular areas is given or intended within programmes:a) TEACHER SALARIES:   Within the agreed arrangements forteacher salaries, special allowances (total some  11M perannum) are paid to teachers in some 3,400 &quot;social priority&apos;schools identified by the Burnham Committee.   Teachers&apos;salaries, including these allowances, rank: as relevant expenditure for Rate Support Grant.   The future of theseallowances (whose importance has been eroded by the Hougbtonaward) is to be reviewed by Burnham.b) RECREATION:   Within the budget of the Sports Council(which has been partly shielded), the highest priority isto be given to grants to play and recreation provision in areas of special social need.c) SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES:   Part of the expenditureon 2 schemes is likely to bring spedal benefit to thoseliving in the inner areas.   These are the Manpower services commission&apos;s work creation scheme and Community Industry(likely to cost respectively  30M and  4.1 M in the financialyear 1976/7).OTHER39     If formula cuts are applied to the National Health Service(8.11), DHSS would not he able to shield from expenditure cuts thehospital services and health centre programmes in those inner areaEwhich are already relatively well provided with health care facillti;and the possibilities of discrimination in favour of seriouslyunder-provided areas would be severely limited.   However, family practitioner services are excluded from the expenditure reductionsand to the extent that inner areas are seriously under-provided withthese services, they might benefit from such expansion as is possibliin these and related community health services.   As to Local TransMServices it is not possible to say more than that the reductionsproposed (Section 6, paras 22-24) in Bus and Underground RevenuwSubsidies will particularly affect metropolitan areas.
ill There are three minor programmes largely directed, to particular areas with inner city problems.   The first two are:a) Scottish Environmental Recovery ProgrammerThis is a small programme, started in 1972, under whicha total of  10M has been made available in grants to local authorities in the Clydeside area forgeneral work to remove dereliction.   This is a once for all programme and is now almost fully committed.b) Section 11, Local Government Act 1966 provides grant tolocal authorities incurring extra costs from thepresence of substantial numbers of commonwealth immigrants in their areas (the grant-earning expenditurein 1974/5 was  13.4m).1+2     The third is the Urban Programme.    It pays 75% grant towards ameliorative measures (current and capital) by localauthorities and voluntary bodies.    It also finances theCommunity Development Project (para 1ii) and would provide the vehicle for the Comprehensive Community Programmes (paras 27).It is the only programme at present available which can be madeto satisfy the criteria in para 29.   The shielding of other HomeOffice programmes would mean the termination of the Urban programme in England (Section 9* paras 1+0 and 1+1).   To maintain it at the1975-76 level would require about  l+M in 1978/9 and about  6Min 1979/80.
