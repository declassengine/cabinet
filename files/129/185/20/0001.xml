IffllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 120 COPY NO 8211 November 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1979-80Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment the MACRO ANALYSIS1. The Treasury argument (as I understand it) goes as follows.    Wemust as our first priority meet the two &quot;prior claims&quot; of a zero balance ofpayments deficit by 1978 and a strong investment boom.    If we do so, wecould have rapidly falling unemployment in 1977 and a risk of over-heatingin 1978.    But without large cuts in public expenditure, the share left for private consumption would be too small, and the level of taxation onindividuals intolerably high.    We must therefore reduce the share of public expenditure in order to increase that of private consumption.2. But the basic premise seems to me extremely unconvincing.    Weshall not in practice meet the two &quot;prior claims&quot;.    On present forecastsand policies it is most unlikely that we shall eliminate the balance ofpayments deficit by 1978 (even if this were a sensible thing to try to do).An early investment boom of the strength suggested by the Treasury seemswildly unlikely.    The probability is that we shall still have substantialunemployment by end-1977.    A huge cut in public expenditure would therefore simply dig a further hole with nothing to fill it.3. I accept that some cuts are inevitable given the likely size of thepublic sector borrowing requirement (even though this is inflated by the fact of recession).    But I conclude that a, they should be significantly lower than the Treasury is demanding, and b. that to keep our options more open,some should be decided and announced now while others should be kept onthe shelf for decision in a year&apos;s time in the light of the developingeconomic outlook.TAXATION VERSUS PUBLIC EXPENDITURE4. But before we decide on public expenditure cuts of whatever size, wemust at least consider whether any part of these could be avoided by highertaxation.
5. I strongly agree with the Chancellor^ ^on-expressed view thatincome tax is now biting dangerously hard.    But. this is not nearly so true of indirect taxes.    It would be quite possible, for example, substantially toraise employers1 national insurance contributions (which are much lower in britain than on the Continent).    True, these would work their way throughinto pi-ices.    But so would many of the Treasury^ proposed cuts insubsidies - consider, for example^, the effect on wage claims and inflation ofan annual rise of  1 or more per week in council rents (a key price fortrades union negotiators).6, We always have to remember that, with the one exception of theNational Health Service, our social benefits are now much less generousthan those of the European Economic Community and Scandinavian countries.PRIORITIES7. It is of course for the Cabinet to decide these and I have recentlyexpressed some views in a minute to the Prime Minister dated 31 October1975.8. But it is disappointing that the Treasury papers give us so little help.(Incidentally, they seem to ignore what came out of the Chequers meeting(CC(75) 39th Conclusions), eg on housing investment where my colleagues will hardly be surprised to hear that the proposals are totally unacceptable to me.)   We would be much assisted (though it would not settle the matterconclusively) by some comparisons of how the major services have fareda. over the last 20 years, and b. as compared (say) with the average for theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.9. One further point on priorities,     I leave my colleagues to decide whether the Party could survive an actual absolute cut in public expenditure (for such, debt interest aside, is involved by the highestTreasury figures) as opposed to a cut in planned programmes of growth.But I remind them of the views strongly expressed at Chequers that we mustso arrange matters that when we go into the next Election, we have at least a limited number of fields in which we can claim a positive and visibleachievement.A department of the Environment11 November 1975
