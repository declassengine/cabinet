OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75)us COPY NO      814 November 1975CABINETSELECTIVE IMPORT controls memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for trade. We have been asked to circulate a paper to Cabinet on the case forimposing selective import controls to protect capacity and employment inseme manufacturing industries and when import penetration in the UnitedKingdom market is high.    The Trades Union Congress (TUC) have arguedfor this in their confidential paper on &quot;Imports and Jobs&quot;, approved bytheir Economic Committee on 8 October,    They have not argued for generalimport controls for balance of payments or other reasons, and the paperdoes not therefore discuss these aspects.2.        It is important to recognise first that over a substantial part of thearea under discussion there are already very significant, restraints, as aresult of a number of measures which can be reconciled with our international obligations.    There is at present a more extensive range of measures affecting imports than at any time in recent years.    In thetextiles and clothing sectors controls are being constantly widened underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Multi FibreArrangement.    A wide range of Japanese textile goods is subject torestraints under the Anglo-Japanese commercial Treaty,    A number of items are still covered by residual quantitative restrictions against eastern europe: these include rubber, footwear, matches, pottery, radio and television seta, electronic components and textiles.    In addition men&apos;sleather footwear from Eastern Europe is currently subject to voluntaryrestraint arrangements.    Japan also has voluntary restraints on exportsto the United Kingdom of colour television sets, cutlery, pottery and ballbearings.    Apart from voluntary restraints the Japanese have given priceundertakings on their exports of television tubes to the United Kingdom andof steel and zips to the whole European Economic Community (e.c.).    Inaddition the Japanese Government has recently acknowledged the need forcar exports to be carried out in an orderly way - as a result a fall in japanese car exports to the United Kingdom is expected.    Imports insensitive sectors are also being closely monitored.    There is United kingdom:surveillance licensing of imports of textiles and clothing and (shortly) of1
television sets and tubes.    There is Community surveillance of imports ofzips, calculators and tape recorders from Japan.3o        The Department of Trade is constantly searching for ways of extending these restraints in appropriate cases0    As regards anti-dumping duties, we have to operate within the terms of our own legislation which inturr is based on the international rules, and under which anti-dumping dutiescan only be imposed in cases where injury to domestic industry is caused or threatened and where there is adequate evidence of dumping; but we go asfar as we can in giving British industry the benefit of any possible doubt.In fact there are no grounds for accusations for dumping in the leading caseswhere imports are most competitive.    But it is clear that the TUC isarguing for a much broader policy of import restraint than the continuation of piecemeal measures along these lines.    Their paper lists a wide range of consumer industries as leading candidates - motorcars, television sets,television tubess radios, electronic components, domestic appliances,textiles, clothing and footwear, and offshore supplies, whose productscompeted with  2, 000 million of import goods in 1974 out of a totalmanufactured imports of  5,000 million.    The situation of these industriesvaries, and there is a preliminary survey of each in the annex to this paper(though further work is needed - see below).    However, it is right to review in this paper the broader arguments on the question^ and these are considered under three headings - the economic case;  internationalrepercussions; and political considerations,THE ECONOMIC CASE4,        The economic case for selective import controls is best argued inthe context of a sector&apos;s longer-term viability rather than on the grounds that jobs are being lost because of imports and could be preserved byimport controls.    The need to impose a viability test in &quot;rescue1 cases isnow generally recognised.    Any direct savings of jobs would need to be balanced against the risk (paragraphs 11 and 12 below) of retaliation andescalating trade restrictions hitting United Kingdom exports and thereforeemployment whether in the same industries or elsewhere.    This riskwould vary with the sector concerned and would have to be assessed caseby case.    Some temporary degree of protection could be justified whileredundancy and re-employment plans were made; but the general dangers of import controls and the risk that firms and industries would simply hangon and press for the restraints to be made permanent have to be recognised.As a matter of timing the effect on import figures and on employmentnormally falls after an interval.    In any extensive scheme it could be asmuch as nine months before the published figures showed aay significant reduction in imports.    There would, however, be some effect on employment before that - say in three to six months - as orders were placed with British firms in anticipation of a lower level of imports.    more general effects, for example, through multiplier processes, would takelonger,
5 The severity of the current recession has aggravated the problemsof individual sectors that had already been facing an increasing degree of import penetration, and has sapped confidence in many firms.    a combination of these two factors has led to cutting back employment,reduced profitability and reluctance to invest or even modernise and itmay in some instances lead to the closing down of existing plant whichwould be viable in normal trading conditions.    In the next upswing, giventhe poor United Kingdom investment and growth record, the chances of restoring this capacity and ensuring vital labour skills are not lost maybe slight, and the result is likely to be additional domestic supplyconstraints and an upward shift in the sector&apos;s propensity to import.Broadly therefore there would be an economic case for selective controlsif only they could be applied for a sufficient period during which theindustry could be restored to long term viability.    There could be no guarantee that import controls on their own would achieve this, and itmay well be they could only make sense if supplemented by some form ofindustry scheme aimed at restoring the sector Js competitive position.Even if the controls were only imposed through the worst of the recessionthey could help the industry to survive in the short term, and by removinga degree of uncertainty help confidence in the sector concerned.    this might help investment decisions, and if supplemented by other measures could ensure time to improve the industry&apos;s performance in the longer term,6,        There are other broader economic con side rations :-i. The effect on the general price level may be small, but the domestic goods which are substituted will tend to be more expensivethan the preferred imports (though this shift may not show up in the retail Price Index (RPI)).    In the case of components where theBritish substitute was more expensive, this could have an effect onthe competitive position of exports further down the productionchain.    Judging from reactions the arrangements on the colour television tube front are having an effect on the price of televisionsets.ii. If the restraint takes the form of a quantitative restriction and is successfully related to the degree of excess capacity in the domestic industry (which is by no means easy), it may be possibleto avoid the extra effect of scarcity leading to higher prices.    Itwill almost certainly not be possible to avoid, however, short termdisruption to production in so far as restraints apply to components.And competition from imports may have been holding domesticprices below the level permitted by the Price Code, so that prices will climb to this level if the competition is removed.iii. The benefit to overall employment is likely to be smallespecially in so far as any increased output were met by increased productivity, and because some of those whose present jobs would3
be saved have skills which are still relatively scarce.    Anestimate of the maximum figure that might be achieved next year if restraint were imposed on the full TUC list would be 30, 000,iv.        Once a case for import controls had been accepted in oneof these industries, it will be more difficult to resist pressuresfor similar treatment elsewhere.7,        Despite these arguments, the balance of economic advantage couldbe in favour of import controls for some specific industries, if only as atemporary counter-cyclical bridging operation, and as part of a package of measures to improve the performance of a particular industry.    Where an industry needs major restructuring, and the Government decides to use the instruments available to it to see that this actually occurs, thepossibility of using some form of import restraint during the period ofrestructuring needs to be retained.    Such cases could arise as theGovernment&apos;s industrial strategy develops and the needs of prioritysectors are examined in detail.INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS8.        The Accession Treaty and the Treaty of Rome bar restrictions on imports from member States.    However, during the transition period,applications can be made under Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession forCommission authority to take protective measures if a particular sector(or region) is faced with persistent difficulties.    If we had a good case,there is no reason to suppose that the Commission would refuse their authority;  and their agreement would reduce the risk of retaliation byother countries.    If the Commission were to refuse their authority andwe took action nonetheless, United Kingdom citizens could challenge thelegality of our actions in the United Kingdom courts; in any event a difficult political situation would then arise.9.        Under the GATT selective import controls could only be justifiedunder Article XIX.    This Article permits import restrictions to be usedwhere products are being imported &quot;in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic production&quot;.    But in most of the cases listed by the TUC imports arefalling in volume terms, even while their share is increasing, because of falling United Kingdom demand.    It would not therefore easily be accepted in the GATT that we had a proper case for involving the Article.    action taken under this Article cannot be applied in a way which discriminatesbetween countries, though it would be possible to exclude other eec countries.    Where items are on the Community liberalisation list, we wouldhave to obtain Community consent to imposing restrictions underArticle XIX;  in other cases simple notification might be sufficient, thoughthe legal position on this is not entirely clear.    The invocation ofArticle XIX may have to be done by the Community on our behalf and,4
indeed, this might be advantageous in preventing any retaliation being directed solely against the United Kingdom.    Affected GATT countries could ask for consultations and are entitled to receive compensation, byway of concessions on other goods or to retaliate against an equal valueof the exports of the restricting country.10.       Finally, we have to take account of the undertaking in theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pledge,which was renewed last May for a further 12 months, not to take newprotective measures,    It was always understood that the Pledge related to action of a general nature and did not preclude action in particularsectors.    Action covering a wide range of sectors - certainly action aswidespread as that asked for by the TUC - would however certainly beregarded as a breach of the OECD undertaking.11.       In practice, the risks of retaliation would depend to some extent on the particular case and the exporting countries most affected.Although in most of these cases the balance of trade with the mainexporting countries is heavily adverse, so that direct retaliation on thesame product would have little or no effect, the GATT allows retaliationon other exports;  and on some United Kingdom products restraints by anyof those countries would be serious.    It is true, as the TUC point out,that other countries have imposed import restraints in recent years without retaliation - eg Italy (in May 1974), France (this year on Italianwine imports and the Commission is taking infraction procedures against france as a result), Australia (in the early 1970s).    But action by theUnited Kingdom on industrial goods, even over a limited range, would beseen as peculiarly damaging in current conditions, when unemployment inmost of the countries affected is as high as and in some cases higher thanin the United Kingdom, both overall and in the particular industries.    Forthis reason national protectionist pressures, notably in the United States,are very strong.12.       The risk is not merely of direct retaliation against United kingdom exports, but, much more serious, of making it impossible for otherGovernments to resist a chain reaction of escalating import controls.It would be very much against the United Kingdom&apos;s interest to risktriggering off a trade war among the major industrialised countries;  our exports, around 50 per cent of manufacturing output, are much greater in volume than our own imports of finished manufacturers, with a correspondingly greater risk to jobs.13.       There are broader international dangers.    Action over a broadfront to prop up our weakest industries by protectionist measures couldbe seen by sterling holders as an inappropriate response and a soft option,leading to a further decline in overseas confidence in United Kingdomeconomic recovery.    It could jeopardise any possible negotiations for obtaining funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to finance the5
balance of payments deficit, which may well be essential over the next fewmonth So    It could be a damaging check to the policy of avoiding &quot;beggarmy neighbour&quot; action to which other major countries, particularly theUnited States, attach great importance.    There would be an element ofthese objections against any selective controls.    But if our action were confined to isolated special cases in which we could mount arguments basedon damage to the industries concerned, we might obtain internationalacquiescence.ACTION AGAINST PARTICULAR COUNTRIES14,       Selective controls do not necessarily have to be applied to all sources.    In some cases the main problem may be eg imports from Japanor eastern area countries, and it might be possible to negotiate restraintarrangements with those countries (as has already been done for severalproducts) which would be less dangerous in terms of internationalrepercussions than general action.    There are cases also - eg cars -where the main problem comes from e.c. countries and where the leastdisruptive course might be action under Article 135, against those countriesonly.15.       In our view the international objections rule out the imposition of selective import controls over a v/ide area of imports.    Whether controls on a particular sector raise similar international opposition depends onthe sectors chosen.    Clearly the political pressure in favour of somerestraint, whether as an alternative to general reflation this winter or aspart of the deal with the TUC on a second year&apos;s co-operation on counter -inflation policy may become very strong indeed.    We need an early reportfrom officials on the scope for some limited action.    But we must recognise that the international dangers on the other side will continue tobe very grave, and we must be prepared to weigh these against the disadvantages of reflationary steps and against the possibilities of securingTUC co-operation by some other means.HANDLING16.       A ccordingly the question of selective import controls needs to be looked at urgently on a case by case basis, by an interdepartmental working party, which is being set up for the purpose.    Each case needs to beconsidered against general criteria.    These criteria could include:i. The degree of import penetration.    It needs to be established that there is a high level of import penetration which has arisenrecently and been achieved rapidly.    The consequences of this need to be analysed for employment and investment in the industry, and consideration given to whether the level of imports is likely to result in the long term loss of United Kingdom manufacturing capacity.6
ii. Prospects for the industry.    It will be important toconsider whether the sector concerned has a long term future.In particular a United Kingdom-based manufacturing capability islikely to be needed where:a. production in the industry makes a substantial contribution to net output;b. production in the industry provides inputs for a wide range of other products.iii. Scope for alternative ways of reducing imports.    an assessment should be made of the scope for reducing imports by voluntary bilateral agreement.    It could also be considered whethernon-tariff restrictions have a role, eg registration and testingprocedures for foreign imports.iv. International obligations and risks of retaliation.    Anyselective control could be countered by:a. action against United Kingdom exports of the sameproduct or products of the same industry;b. action against other United Kingdom exports to thecountries where trade was affected by the import controls.The extent of bilateral trade in the products of the industry will need to be established in order to assess the damage that action under a.could cause to the United Kingdom industry and the trade balance.For b. the extent of trade with the affected countries and theconsequences of retaliation would similarly need to be established.v. The effects on United Kingdom consumer prices. The extentof price difference between United Kingdom and foreign products and the downstream effects will need to be analysed, together withthe capacity of the United Kingdom industry to supply the expectedincreased demand for United Kingdom production without significantprice increases.vi. The appropriate form of import controls.    If a case can bemade out for some form of import restrictions the alternative methods should be evaluated.    The usual ways of restricting imports are by the imposition of:a. quotas;b. a surcharge;c. import deposits.
Quotas enable the Government to set a precise target for a reduction in imports (though not necessarily to achieve it so precisely).    But they arerigid in administration;  whilst this is perhaps not so important in thecase of consumer goods, quotas applied to anything used as componentsby industry can cause disruption to production and generally createirritating and sometimes expensive delays.    Surcharges and deposits areeasier to administer and carry far less risks of disrupting production.It is not however possible with any certainty to tell in advance what theeffect on imports will be of any particular level of surcharge or deposit.RECOMMENDATION17,       In our view the case against any major unilateral move to imposeselective controls on a range of imports in present circumstances is very strong.    It should be recognised that a good deal has been and is being done, within the restraints imposed by our international obligations; butthe risks in going beyond this limitation would be very great indeed.    Inour view those risks outweigh any sectoral economic advantages whichcould be gained.    However, this does not necessarily rule out restrictions in particular sectors though these would need to be carefully consideredcase by case.    The interdepartmental working party which has been setup under Treasury chairmanship to examine the TUC proposals, will produce an early report for Ministers.    The annexes attached set out thefactual background, but do not give a fully argued treatment of the case ineach sector, and need to be expanded into a full paper on each of thesectors mainly concerned.D W HP STreasury Chambers4 November 19758

For 1976 the Japanese have undertaken to market their carsin an orderly way and it has been agreed that further discussions should takeplace in December between representatives of the two motor industries.   following the outcome the SMMT announced publicly that it did not wish to see import quotasimproved in the motor-car sector.

TEXTILES (SITC ORDER XIII)tWhereas home demand has declined by about li5%i exports have fallen by 27%resulting in a fall of UK production of about 6%.   Imports of fibres andyarns fell by about 15%, and fabrics by 13%.   Compared with the 1973 peakin the textile cycle the decline in UK production is of the order of 15%.Under-use of capacity varies widely in the separate sectors; eg man-madefibres ^0-50%, spinning of cotton and mmf yarn 2&apos;*-30%, weaving of cotton and mmf fabric 19-38%, knitwear 25%.In consequence unemployment has risen as has short-time working,Prospects for an upturn are uncertain.   While the situation doernot appear to have worsened in the period June-September 1975, no improvementcan be expected until well into 1976 and because the depression in textilesis world-wide there is little prospect of exports improving in the face ofthe severe competition engendered by the excess capacity everywhere.Many low cost textile imports are now restrained under the GAIT HultifibrcArrangement (MFA) to about their 197^ levels.   These controls were onlyimposed in the second half of 1975; their efi&apos;6ct should be to cut manyimports in the second half of the year to below their level in the first.Import penetrations range from under 10% in wool textiles to about 50% inwoven cotton cloth.   The MFA does not allow imports to be cut back and ifwe overrode this prohibition by invoking other GATT provisions it would carry a serious risk of disrupting the MFA and endangering the arrangementsmade under it for sharing some of the UK import burden with the rest of the eec, - &apos;(Explanatory note:   Except where otherwise stated percentage changes comparethe period Jan-June 1975 with the corresponding period in 197&apos;u)

CLOTHING (SITC ORDER XV - PART )

Retail sales have been reasonably buoyant during the first six months of 1975 and there has been a continuing rise in some imports despite existing and new restrictions on low cost imports. The fall in new orders arising from reductions in the stocks held by retailers and wholesalers has shown signs of levelling out but is still a problem. On past experience imports tend to respond faster than home production when demand recovers.

Import penetration overall in 1975 is expected to be about 16% but is much higher in certain types of clothing; eg woven shirts 57%, knitted shirts 46% blouses 55%, men&apos;s and boys jackets 50%, trousers and jeans 45% (all for the period Jan-June 1975). Exports which in the main cater for the medium to higher priced sectors in overseas markets are encountering increased competition.

The prospects for the UK clothing industry indicate little change with under-use of capacity of up to 20% in shirts not untypical. Imports are expected to continue to rise and with exports more or less static the trade balance could well worsen and employment decline further. However, the MFA does not allow imports to be cut back and if we overrode this prohibition by invoking other GATT provisions it would carry a serious risk of disrupting the MFA.

OOTV/EAR (liLil 450)hasOutput by UK manufacturers / fallen in the first half of 1975ylargely due to destocking by retailers, although both   export and home sales have fallen2.    Import penetration has been growing, with foreign producershaving a significant price advantage which has resulted in highimport penetration measured on a volume basis.   However the general trend disguises the substantial overall increases in imports from certain sources eg Italy, Hong Kong and Malaysia., but reductionsfrom others, Korea, India and Japan, and also a reduction in import penetration in certain sectors eg men&apos;s leather shoes andan increase in others eg women&apos;s leather shoes between the first half of 1974 and the first half of 1975-3,    The British footwear industry has been experiencing severedifficulties and has attached much of the blame on cheap imports,some of which came from Gzechslovakia, Poland and Romania.    Theindustry has pressed for the impositions of restrictions ofimports of men&apos;s leather footwear from these 3 state-tradingcountries where exports to this country (excluding sandals) roseby about 19% in 1974 compared with 1973*   As a result of an anti-dumping investigation undertaken in 1972 an understanding hadbeen reached with the 3 countries that they would warn us ofsignificant increases in their exports to the TJK.4.    It became necessary to ask them voluntarily to restrain their exports and they have now agreed to restrain exports of men&apos;sleather footwear (excluding sandals) to the UK in 1975 at a levelbetween 5-10% below that of comparable exports in 1974.   this represented a decline of some 300,000 pairs.    The position in1976 has not yet been discussed but we will aibmost certainly need to appeal to them again to exercise restraint.

Imports were  156m at current prices (tubes  37m), mainly from USA, Japan, Germany and France.   Exports were  91m at current prices.   Thereis considerable international specialisation and much of the trade is done bymltinational companies.Radio and Electronic Components (MLH 364)Hoine Demanda.    constant 1970 prices  mOutputa.

r some sectors the UK is very strong and likely to remain so (eg record turntables,abstain loudspeakers).   In terms of price, UK manufacturers find it difficult toLete in certain mans produced components in which Far Eastern countries specialise.&apos;j:c UK is more competitive in custom-built specialised components.   There is[cnsiderable spare capacity,Ifhere is room Cor improvement in the balance of trade, but equipment makers need fscess to imports, and if controls were introduced some disruption of  -    - .3roduction could be  expected.57 tubesAlthough half of UK domestic demand for colour TV tubes is met by imports most ofthese are of size or types not at present made in the UK. In the first 6 months of \(1975, over a ^ of the market was for the small screen sizes (below 22&quot;) not available;from the British Industry and, of the rest, a substantial proportion were of technicalvarieties brought in by the TV tube manufacturers themselves to, complement their existing ranges. The basic problem is not the quantity of imports so much as the price at which they were cold in the UK market. These prices tend to. fix the domestic price level. i-I Following the Secretary of State for Trade&apos;s visit to Japan the Japanese Government;  has agreed to indicate to their manufacturers to increase prices in the UK of those   Itypes of colour TV tube which are or about to be made in UK closer to the break-even fj*ice of UK industry.   Quantitative restrictions sufficient to provide any significan;iadditional volume for the UK industry would require such savage cuts in imports that Iit could cause serious unemployment in the TV set making industrys     - Ii-   &apos;wen ;i with the closure of Pilkington&apos;s Ravenhead factory, there is ample capacity-(in Milliard) for making Colour TV tube glass to meet future UK requirements, which isfconsiderably under-used at present.

TELEVISION SETSThe production of Colour TVs are by far the most important sector ofthe industry, having grown rapidly in the early seventies.   home demand has fallen sharply although exports have been increasingsignificantly.Future prospects for the industy depend on the prospects for consumersexpenditure, and on the intensity of foreign competition 4,   TheJapanese have said that they do not propose to renew their voluntaryrestraint on colour TV sets after the end of this year, on thegrounds that the numbers of Japanese sets exported to the UK havefallen subotantially (which is the case).   We expect shortly to instruct our Ambassador in Tokyo to make it clear to the Japanese thatif their exports rise to a level at which they exceed the share ofthe market they have enjoyed hitherto HMG would be prepared ifnecessary to impose import controls 9

mm 135 -DOMESTIC ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES (HLH 368)Home sales in 1975 have fallen by about 10% over 1974 and thedomesbic electrical appliance industry is, in general, currentlyworking at about 20-25% below capacity.   The effects of the recentVAT increase have proved less severe than the industry expected,but there has been a substantial downturn in sales of cookers,heaters and dishvrasbers - all being down about 50% on last year.2,    Imports, (notably Italian refrigerators) have for some yearstaken a substantial share of the UK market due to their highlycompetitive prices and up to date product ranges.    Palling demand in the US has affected imports to a considerable extent, for example,diswasber impoxvts are almost 60% down on last year.3.    Exports are down by about 10% in 1975 and the industry haslittle expectation of any upturn&apos; in exports until well into 1976.
GLASSUnder this heading the TUC also refer to TV tube production aa well to flat glass production.   The position of the TV tube sector is presented elsewhere.
