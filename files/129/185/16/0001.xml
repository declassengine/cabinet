1975 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY-GENERALREVIEWINTRODUCTIONThe Cabinet decided in May that while decisions on the total levelof expenditure had still to be taken, officials should prepare the1975 Report on a basis which would illustrate the implications of substantial reductions. The detailed ground rules for the Surveywhich were approved by the Cabinet are reproduced at Annex A(pages 14-20).2. The Cabinet also agreed that before considering the Report theywould have further discussions on the medium-term economic prospects and on their priorities within the various elements ofpublic expenditure.   These discussions have now taken place.3. The present Report is intended to provide a basis for the specificdecisions which are now required on individual programmes, togive effect to the views already expressed on the total and onpriorities. These decisions need to be taken early in the autumn, inorder to enable the planning of expenditure programmes to proceed in an orderly way, and to provide a framework for the annual public expenditure White Paper.THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 1974 TO 19794. A paper on the medium-term economic prospects was circulatedto the Cabinet in July. This showed that after allowing for theresources needed for the balance of trade and investment, the growthbetween 1974 and 1979 in the resources available for public expenditure and privately-financed consumption was likely to beof the order of 1  per cent per annum. If the public expenditure programmes to 1978-79 had remained as they were when the Surveystarted (22 May 1975), the demand placed by public expenditure on resources would be increasing at an annual rate of just under 2 percent over the period, and privately-financed consumption would rise, from the depressed 1974 base, by between f and 1 per cent per annum.5. The Public Expenditure Survey was designed to show the implications of substantial reductions in the up-dated White Paperfigures.* When these reductions are taken together with the costof new policies and estimating changes the growth of public expenditure over the medium-term period 1974-1979 comes down* Taking account of changes between Cmnd. 5879 and 22 May.
to 1 - 4 per cent per annum, and the average increase in privatelyfinanced consumption rises to about 1-3 per cent per annum still avery low rate, especially in view of the depressed 1974 base.6. The prospects are summarised in Table 1 below, which followsthe same basic pattern as the resources table published in the public expenditure White Papers. Column A shows the picture with theexpenditure programmes as they stood on 22 May. Column Bshows an alternative picture with public expenditure as estimated in the Survey.TABLE 1Allocation of Resources, 1974-79(Demand terms at 1970 factor cost prices)Average annual increases 1974-79A.

The growth of GDP is alittle faster because more of the labour force is assumed to be working in industry and commerce, and although investment would also be higher,and more resources would be needed for the balance of payments, the growth of &quot; free resources &quot; would still go up a little.(2) Excludes nationalised industry investment (included in prior claims).THE SURVEY7. Tables A and B on pages 10 and 11 bring together the figures shown in this Survey, analysed by expenditure programme and by economic category. The detailed programme figures and the implications of adopting them are set out in the programme chaptersin Part 2 of this Report.
8. The Report illustrates the effect of expenditure reductions intwo ways. First, the ground-rules required reductions to be madeto most expenditure on goods and services (and some otherrelatively small items), and officials were asked to describe in theReport the effect of these reductions. Second, when examiningprogrammes, officials were also asked to identify and illustrate the implications of policy changes which would enable expenditure tobe reduced if required. It should be noted that while the first ofthese the Survey reductions have been incorporated in the Tablesof expenditure figures in this Report, the second category the other policy options have not, but are separately costed. For convenienceboth these categories of expenditure reductions are listed, in summaryform, in Annex B (pages 21-27). This list distinguishes, for each pro-gramme, the reductions already incorporated in the Survey figuresfrom the other policy options which are not incorporated.9. Departments were also asked to follow up Ministerial exchangesearlier in the year about the possibilities for public expendituresavings through lower standards. The results of this follow-up are summarised in special Analysis 7 of Part 2 of this Report.10. In addition, the Survey figures include the costings of certainnew proposals which were not included in Cmnd. 5879. The main proposals now costed in this way are shown in Table 2 below.TABLE 2  million 1975 Survey prices1975-76  1976-77  1977-78  1978-79  1979-80National Enterprise Board*	50	195	182	165	117Selective assistance to					industry*	305	49	72	49	32Scottish and Welsh					Development Agenciesf	15	47	62	69	77Community ownership of					development land	 	29	77	137	130Air Travel Reserve Fund .	10	4	-4	-10	 British National Oil					CorporationJ	100	500			Total	480	824	389	410	356* Including provision for BLMC as follows:not      ...       - 44 77 69 28Selective assistance   .      260 26 46 41 28f Includes some provision transferred from other programmes.$ Estimates are not available for 1977-78 to 1979-80; expenditure for these years will be a charge on the contingency reserve.
11. Apart from the cost of new proposals two major estimatingchanges have increased public expenditure since Cmnd. 5879. First,it has been necessary to revise some of the economic assumptionsused in the Survey to take account of the effects of the Governmenfscounter-inflation policies outlined in Cmnd. 6151. These changes have the effect of increasing programmes expressed at constant prices; in particular for three programmes. Second, forecasts of debt interest are substantially higher than in Cmnd. 5879. Table Bon page 11 shows debt interest rising at an average annual rateof 7-1 per cent at constant prices between 1974-75 and 1979-80.This compares with the expectation in Cmnd. 5879 that debt interest at constant prices would fall in the period 1974-75 to 1978-79at an average annual rate of 2-7 per cent. The changes betweenCmnd. 5879 and the Survey are mainly because of revised assump-tions about the size of the public sector borrowing requirement and about the level of future inflation. The increases in public expenditure due to these two factors are shown in Table 3 below.TABLE 3  million at 1975 Survey prices1975-76   1976-77  1977-78  1978-79  1979-80Effect of Cmnd. 6151 onprogrammesTrade, industry andemployment (mainlyrefinancing of export and Shipbuilding credit)	\     	+46	4-75	4-89	4-84Housing	-2	-49	-f27	4-165	4-200Social Security	 	4-459	+606	4-408	+317Other  ....	-11	+ 13	-18	-14	-15Total effect on programmes	-13	-1-469	+690	4-648	4-586Debt interest change since					Cmnd. 5879 .	4-582	-f-2,207	4-3,382	4-3,257	 12. The application of the ground rules produced net reductions of 2,200 million in forecast expenditure on goods and services in1978-79, after taking account of additions for new proposalstotalling  410 million (see Table 2 on page 4) not previously includedin programmes but before taking account of Cmnd. 6151. after taking account of the revised economic assumptions necessary asa result of Cmnd. 6151 the reductions since 22 May shown in the survey amount to  1,552 million. The other policy options identifiedby Departments include alternatives and amount to  1,860 million- 2,110 million. Table 4 summarises the position and shows the transition from the base date for the Survey to the pre and postCmnd. 6151 position.

Further measures have been agreed by Ministers but have notbeen included in the Survey figures either because Part 2 had beenfinalised before they were agreed, or because decisions are still necessary on timing or other details. Table C on page 12 sets out themain items in this category with an indication of their costings. the totals are as follows:  million at 1975 Survey prices1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-8093	-82	22	22	14SPECIAL ASPECTS14. As well as looking at the individual expenditure programmes,Ministers will also need to consider three special aspects.15. First, a large amount of expenditure in various programmes is administered by local authorities; and of this current expendi-ture is not directly controlled by Central Government, althoughfinanced as to about two-thirds (three-quarters in Scotland) throughthe Rate Support Grant. A separate analysis is given in Annex C(pages 28-32).16. Second, expenditure on construction in the various programmesaccounts for a high proportion of the workload of the construction industry. Changes in the level of this expenditure are thus verysignificant for the size and well-being of the industry. A fuller note on this problem is at Annex D (pages 33-37).17. Third, the figures in Tables A and B, like the figures in the detailed programme tables in Part 2, are in constant 1975 survey prices (in &quot; volume &quot; terms). They provide a measure of the scale of provision of services, and how this changes over time.  But they
do not take account of future price changes; and the prices whichare important for public expenditure, especially wages and salaries,tend, on average, to rise faster than prices in general. As a result,the volume figures do not fully reflect the cost involved in terms ofother goods forgone. It is possible although only in a very broadway to adjust the figures for this &quot; relative price effect &quot;, and thisis done in Annex E (pages 38-40) where account is taken not only of the normal relationships but of the  6 a week limit on pay settle-ments and the relative fall expected in construction prices in the nextfew years.18. Moreover, different types of public expenditure vary in theextent to which they place a demand on resources. Expenditureon goods and services, whether capital or current, makes a directclaim on resources by the public authority Concerned. transfer payments do not add to the demand on resources by public sectorauthorities, but they do add to the demand of the recipients, andthis additional demand has also to be taken into account in themanagement of the economy. The amount of the demandgenerated by transfer payments will usually be rather lower than for direct expenditure because some of the payments may flowback in direct taxation or be saved rather than spent.19. To allow for this, each economic category is assigned a&quot; demand weight &quot; reflecting the relative demand which, on average, 100 of expenditure in that category places on resources (as explained in Annex E). However, while these adjusted figures give a bettermeasure of changes in the demand which public expenditure imposeson resources, all public sector spending including for example thepurchase of company shares either adds directly to the government -menfs borrowing requirements, or exacerbates the problem of accommodating any given borrowing requirement. Given the levelof taxation, any addition to public expenditure, however low thedemand content, thus makes it more difficult to manage monetary policy. There may also be important implications for international confidence.TOTAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURE20. In addition to the figures for individual programmes, total public expenditure contains provision for debt interest (see para-graph 11 above), a contingency reserve, and a deduction for shortfall.21. The contingency reserve allowance is intended to cover anumber of different types of expenditure, for example, new policiesannounced by the Government but not included in programmes(see paragraph 13 above and Table C on page 12); later policies orrevised costs of existing policies which cannot be offset by reductions
in expenditure elsewhere; and unpredictable events. The figures forthe contingency reserve in this Report are expressed in volume terms.In Cmnd. 5879 they were expressed in demand terms.22. The deduction for shortfall for each year from 1976-77 takes account of net underspending which in the past has occurred overthe programmes as a whole, but which it is not possible to allocatein advance to any individual programme.CASH LIMITS23. As announced in the White Paper &quot; The Attack on Inflation &quot;(Cmnd. 6151), cash limits will be applied to an extensive range of services, starting in 1976-77. For these services, the volume figuresfor 1976-77 which are decided by Ministers as a result of the 1975Survey will therefore also provide the basis for the calculation of the relevant cash limits, although some adjustment may be requiredin order to take account of changes in the economic prospectsbetween the time when the White Paper figures are prepared andthe time when cash limits are fixed. Once these cash limits havebeen fixed, they will however take primacy over the volume figures.The eventual volume out-turn will thus be affected by the move-ment of prices for the service in question, and hence will notnecessarily be identical with the volume figures decided in the survey and published in the White Paper. This is an inevitableeffect of control in cash terms.THE BROAD PICTURE24. The overall picture can be looked at in a number of ways.The growth of public expenditure can be looked at from year to year. Or it can be compared with the position shown in theprevious White Paper. The Governments plans must be defensiblefrom either point of view.25. Considering the growth from year to year, the Survey figures in Table A show the following percentage changes comparedwith the previous year:1974-75     1975-76     1976-77     1977-78     1978-79     1979-808-0 4-2 3-2 2-3 - -0-426.  When volume figures are adjusted to take account of therelative price effect these percentage growth rates become:1974-75    .1975-76     1976-77     1977-78 1978-79     1979-8012-4      &apos;   4-8           2-7           2-2 0-3 0-1
27. The average annual rate of growth from 1974-75 to 1979-80in volume terms is 1 - 8 per cent; and in cost terms (including the&quot; relative price effect&quot;) it is 2-0 per cent. The average annual rateof growth of demand on resources (in cost terms) is 2 - 2 per cent.28. The other comparison is with Cmnd. 5879. Annex F provides a detailed analysis, by expenditure programme, of the differencebetween Cmnd. 5879 and this Survey. In summary, the comparisonfor 1978-79 (the last year of Cmnd. 5879) is shown in Table Don page 13.THE CHOICES FOR MINISTERS29. This Report is intended to provide a factual basis for thedecisions which Ministers now need to take. The decisions required as a basis for the preparation of the White Paper are as follows:(a) The total to be aimed for in each year to 1978-79 and the ceiling on total public expenditure in 1979-80.(b) In the light of the Cabinefs discussion of public expendi-ture priorities and in order to keep within the figureset for total public expenditure in each year:(i) whether the Survey reductions should be adopted for each programme, with or without modifica-tions;(ii) which other policy options should be adopted.

ANNEX ABasis adopted in arriving at the expenditure figures in the 1975 Survey for 1975-76 and later years the GROUND RULESIntroductionThe purpose of the Survey is to illustrate for Ministers the implications-tions for expenditure programmes of reducing the level of public expenditure below that shown in the January 1975 White Paper(Cmnd. 5879). The aim is to provide Ministers with a basis fortheir discussions on the total level of public expenditure and on the priorities to be observed within the total.2. The reductions in expenditure in 1976-77 announced in theBudget statement will need to be reflected in the Survey. Theproposed ground rules for the subsequent years are designed to illustrate the effect of a progressive reduction from the Cmnd. 5879levels in those years. So far as possible, these ground rules treatexpenditure by reference to its general economic category, although some adaptation has been necessary in particular cases.3. The basic starting point for the Survey is the expenditure programme figures incorporated in the White Paper, revalued to 1975Survey prices, and adjusted to reflect changes, both policy andestimating changes, recorded up to the starting date for the survey,which, it is suggested, should be 23 May. These basic figures wouldthen be further modified as indicated in paragraphs 5-11 below,supplemented where necessary by Appendices .1 and 2.4. Officials in Departments and the Treasury (and the Civil service department, as appropriate) would then assess the extent to whichexisting policies could still be carried out at or within these modifiedprogramme totals. If the existing policies could not be carried out without exceeding these totals, the report should show what couldbe accomplished within the totals, and the policy changes whichthis might involve. In the case of services to which percentagereductions do not apply, officials should explore and illustrate the implications of policy changes which Departments or the Treasuryconsider could be made to reduce expenditure.Calculation of the modified totals5. Subject to the special cases mentioned in Appendix 2, the general principles to be applied are as follows.
1975-766. The figures to be entered in the Survey are the latest costingsas at 23 May 1975, and will include any modifications flowing fromthe changes to 1976-77 announced in the Chancellors budget statement.)1976-777. The figures to be entered are the basic figures as in paragraph above, modified to take account of changes announced in the budget statement.1977-78 and 1978-798. The total figures to be entered for these years would generally be derived by a broad percentage adjustment of the basic figures in paragraph 3 above.9. The percentage reductions to be applied to the basic figures are explained in Appendix 1. These reductions apply to current expenditure on goods and services, current grants to private bodies,gross domestic fixed capital formation and capital grants to persons and private non-profit making bodies. Other economic categories,and the services listed as exceptions in Appendix 1, would not besubject to these percentage reductions, but would be treated inaccordance with Appendix 2. It should however be stressed that theapplication of percentage reductions is designed to produce certaintotals for each of the main programmes (and Departmental shares in those programmes, including any expenditure incurred on their behalf by the Property Services Agency). Departments would generally then be free to reallocate the totals within their share ofeach programme, provided that the overall demand content is notthereby increased.1979-8010. For this year no figures are available from Cmnd. 5879. the survey totals for this year should therefore be calculated byestimating the expenditure in 1979-80 which would flow from a continuation of the modified policies which could be affordedwithin the totals derived as explained above for the earlier years.Except where justified by demographic factors, the growth of eachmain programme from 1978-79 to 1979-80 should not be allowedto exceed the average annual growth rate during the period 1975-76to 1978-79 implied by the figures to be entered in the Survey forthat period.
Programmes not costed in the White Paper11. The programmes in the White Paper do not include the costof certain policies which Ministers had decided to adopt before theWhite Paper was published, but which had not at that stage reachedthe point at which they could be costed on a year-by-year basis.These were left as a potential charge on the contingency reserve.Wherever possible, these programmes should now be costed with a comparable degree of stringency to that implied above for other programmes, for consideration by Ministers in the light of the survey.Charges12. In certain cases (e.g. school meals) a charge is levied as anoffset to the cost. For the purpose of the Survey, the calculation of these charges should be based on the assumptions underlying theWhite Paper figures. The expenditure totals should be derivedfrom the White Paper figures for the cost of the service net of charges. The report should thus display the consequences (whether in terms of charging policy or some other policy modifications) of keeping the cost of the service, net of charges, within the totalsmodified in accordance with the procedure set out above. Thepossibility of increasing charges should also be separately examined in all cases.Savings through lower standards13. The Prime Minister has asked the Treasury and the CPRS tofollow up the replies sent by Departments to the Prime Ministersminute of 24 December about the prospects for expenditure savingsthrough lower standards. Treasury expenditure divisions (in con-sultation with CPRS) will discuss with departments, in the context of the 1975 Survey, the extent to which lower standards couldcontribute to expenditure reductions in the programmes concerned.A report on the outcome will be incorporated in the Survey report.
APPENDIX 1Percentage reductionsThe percentage reductions referred to in paragraph 9 of the mainpaper are as follows:A. CurrentCurrent expenditure on goods and services-wages and salaries-other cegsCurrent grants to private bodiesB. CapitalGross domestic fixed capital formationCapital grants to private sector persons and ^private non-profit-making bodies1977-78     1978-7910%15%20%The following services are not subject to these general percentagereductions, but should instead be treated in accordance with the relevant paragraphs of Appendix 2: investment by nationalised industries, Regional Water Authorities and the Civil aviation authority; certain expenditures in support of productive industry(see paragraph 3 of Appendix 2); housing (including new dwellings inother programmes); &quot; basic needs &quot; school building; defence; super-annuation payments; administrative costs of social security benefits and revenue collection; and current expenditure on certain&quot; demand-determined &quot; services (see paragraph 9 of Appendix 2).
APPENDIX 2Rules for particular categoriesThe general principles in the main ground rules may require modifi-cation in the following cases.Expenditure in support of productive industry. The productive investment of the nationalised industries, theCivil Aviation Authority and Regional Water Authorities, needs tobe considered in the light of the demand for the products and their commercial prospects, and their contribution to the growth of thecountry&apos;s productive capacity and exports. The investment pro-grammes should be discussed individually between the treasury and Departments in the light of these criteria.3. Expenditure on regional support and regeneration; industrialinnovation; general support for industry; functioning of the labour market; agricultural support; support for fishing industry; andexpenditure on infrastructure which is a direct consequence of thedevelopment of offshore oil; will not be subject to the percentagereductions in Appendix 1, but otherwise the general procedure inparagraphs 3 and 4 of the main ground rules would apply.Housing4. Expenditure on housing (and new dwellings in other pro-grammes) is not subject to the percentage reductions in Appendix 1,but the expenditure totals for 1977-78 and 1978-79 (as well as thatfor 1976-77) should be reduced by a sum equal to the reductionannounced for 1976-77 in the Budget Statement. Otherwise thegeneral procedure described in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the mainground rules would apply.Defence5. Defence has already been subjected to a full review, and sub-stantial reductions by comparison with the cost of previous plans were announced by the Secretary of State on 3 December. Thefigures to be used for the 1975 Survey should therefore be as follows:(a) For 1976-77, the revalued White Paper figure modified inaccordance with the Chancellor^ Budget Statement;(b) For the years from 1977-78 onwards, the revalued white paper figures modified in accordance with the cabinet decision that detailed studies should be initiated to attemptto accelerate the savings resulting from the recent defence review.
In addition, an indication should be given of the effect of applyingreductions comparable to those in Appendix 1 to the years from1977-78 onwards.Overseas aid. The overseas aid programme would be subject to the same level of percentage reductions as that shown for current expenditureon goods and services in part A of the table in Appendix 1. Super-annuation payments would not be covered by these reductions, nor would expenditure by the Commonwealth Development Corporationwhich is not counted within the aid programme.Current grants to persons7. Expenditure classified under this heading (and the relatedadministrative costs) should be forecast on the basis of numberseligible and the economic assumptions adopted for the Survey. Itwill be necessary to explore or illustrate policy changes which departments or the Treasury consider could be made to reduce expenditure on those programmes and the savings which these would imply. It will be particularly important to identify new services or benefits on which expenditure is due to start during the survey period but where the expenditure is not irrevocably committed (a)in operational terms or (b) in terms of public announcements.Subsidies8. The figures for subsidies in each of the years after 1976-77 shouldbe reduced by at least as much as the reductions announced for thatyear. The possibility of further reductions should be fully exploredin all cases.&quot; Demand-determined &quot; services9. The level of expenditure on some services is &quot; demand-determined &quot; in the sense that once the basic framework has been laid down all proper demands on it have to be met and arbitraryfinancial limits cannot readily be imposed. Current expenditure onthe following services is not therefore subject to the percentagereductions in paragraph 1, viz: family practitioner services, drugs,food and medical stores in hospitals and social service homes, grants for residential homes, welfare milk, school meals and milk and school transport, concessionary fares paid under existing schemes,legal aid, crown and police prosecutions, food in prisons, rates on government property, and other rent and rates. Instead, the best available estimate should be given of the likely cost of uptake ofthe services concerned. If there is an estimating reduction comparedwith Cmnd. 5879, it should not be used to finance increases in otherparts of the main programme concerned. If there is an estimating
increase, officials should, wherever possible, identify savings whichwould enable the increase to be absorbed. The Departments con-cerned would need to reach agreement with the Treasury at the outset on the extent to which their expenditure may fall to bedealt with under this heading. It will be necessary to explore orillustrate policy changes which Departments or the Treasury con-sider could be made to reduce expenditure on these programmes,and the savings which these would imply. It will be particularly important to identify early in the Survey new services or benefits on which expenditure is due to start during the Survey period but where the expenditure is not irrevocably committed (a) in operationalterms or (b) in terms of public announcements.Other categories10. For debt interest, superannuation payments, the administrative costs of revenue collection, and unattributed e.c. contributions, thelatest available forecasts should be provided.11. For other categories not previously mentioned in Appendix 1 or , percentage reductions would not be applied, but otherwise theprocedure in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the main ground rules would apply.Northern Ireland12. Items included in the Northern Ireland main programme shouldbe treated in the same way as the analogous items in other programmes.General13. The following points should be noted by way of interpretation of the main ground rules:(a) In certain programmes, adjustments were made in cmnd. 5879, for presentational reasons, between the approved expenditure totals and the contingency reserve.In these cases, any references to the &quot; White Paper figures &quot;should be taken to mean the underlying policy figuresapproved by Ministers before the White Paper was published.(b) The items referred to in paragraph 11 of the main groundrules which were not costed on a year-by-year basis beforethe publication of Cmnd. 5879, are: selective assistance andother industrial support; Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies; public ownership of aircraft and shipbuilding industries and ports and road haulage; National EnterpriseBoard; capital expenditure of British National Oil Corpora-tion; and community ownership of development land.

ANNEX CLocal authority current expenditure . Local authority current expenditure in Great Britain as summarised in the table below* shows an increase of 8 per cent between 1973-74 and 1974-75. The estimates for individual programmes imply an increase in total expenditure of around 4 percent in 1975-76 and, in the light of the reductions announced in the april Budget statement, a further \ per cent in 1976-77. However,on the best evidence now available the actual expenditure in 1975-76is likely to be around 6 per cent (see paragraph 4 below). The broadeffect of the 1975 Survey ground rules is that the standstill in totalexpenditure in 1976-77 will continue through to 1979-80.  million at 1975 Survey prices1973   1974   1975   1976  1977  1978   1979-74    -75    -76    -77    -78    -79    -80Great BritainRoads and transport .      .    538 680 716 668 642    612 611Housing .      .      .      .450 518 501 418 454    471 477Other environmental services 803 897 937 961 948 917 910Law, order and protectiveservices       .      .      .871 910 935 957 974    987 1,008Education and libraries    . 4,283 4,477 4,652 4,764 4,795 4,798 4,792Personal social services     .    571 647 686 699 711    722 734Miscellaneous service so . 76 79 83 84 85 86 87Estimated   overspend   in1975-76(2)   .      .                150 -          Total    .      .      . 7,592 8,208 8,660 8,551 8,609 8,593 8,619(x) Other public services, assistance to agriculture and employment services.O It is not possible to allocate this estimated additional expenditure to individual services (see paragraph 4).1974-75 and 1975-76: Reliability of the Estimates2. It should be noted, however, that the figures shown for 1974-75are based on only limited outturn data from local authorities. Theywill be revised when provisional outturn data becomes availablein the autumn. Meanwhile the estimates represent the best assess-ment that Departments can make of the likely outturn.* Detailed analyses for England and Wales and for Scotland, andreconciliations with &quot; relevant&quot; expenditure for rate support grant purposes,are given in Special Analysis 1 in Part 2 of this Report.
3. For 1975-76, it was recognised last autumn that a sharp reductionin the rate of increase of this expenditure would not be achievedunless the Government gave clear guidance about the implications for each of the main services. Following considerable inter-Departmental discussion about the nature of such guidance, thiswas issued in circulars to local authorities (No. 171/74 in Englandand Wales, 9/1975 in Scotland). There seems little doubt that, as a consequence, the rate of increase in spending has been reduced.4. However, analysis of the rate calls in England and Walessuggests that authorities may be increasing their expenditure(compared with 1974-75) by about 6 per cent rather than the 4 per cent which is implied by the estimates for individual programmes in thisReport (and was accepted for rate support grant purposes assufficient to meet inescapable commitments). The expectation thatactual expenditure in 1975-76 will exceed the estimates shown is supported by reports that a number of Councils have budgeted for increases in excess of inescapable commitments. While it is not yet known whether any valid deductions can be made from the com-parison, the first of the new quarterly manpower returns showsmuch higher staff numbers at end March 1975 than the separatereturns collected by the Department of Employment for June 1974.In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, therefore, thepresumption must be that the estimates of expenditure in 1975-76will be exceeded, possibly by some 2 per cent (around  150 million).Agreement by the Consultative Council on Local government finance that this degree of overspending was likely, and that itimplied no scope for any further increase in total expenditure in1976-77, was announced by the Secretary of State for the Environ-ment on 5 August, 1975. It is not yet possible to allocate theestimated overspending between individual programmes.5. It is not yet possible to assess the prospects for actual expenditurein Scotland in 1975-76.Implications for the Main Services : 1976-77 Onwards6. The implications of restricting expenditure to the levels shown for 1976-77 onwards are described in the Programme chapters inPart 2 of this Report.7. The Consultative Council on Local Government Finance hasalready been warned that there will be difficult implications for1976-77 in getting expenditure down to the levels announced in theBudget. Exactly what these decisions will involve depends on the detailed studies now being undertaken in consultation with local
authority associations. The outcome will be set out in the reportsof the sub-groups for each service which will be completed aboutthe end of September.8. For 1977-78 onwards, the principal consequences of the impliedreductions in expenditure are:(a) Roads and Transport: There should be further reductions in standards of road maintenance. Following the fasterincrease in bus fares required in 1976-77, the increasesrequired in subsequent years by previous government policy will be unchanged.(b) Housing: It is assumed that rents will increase by about per cent in real terms in 1977-78 and that thereafterthey will rise in line with the cost of living. Rent Rebatesand Allowances are extrapolated at present levels on theassumption that the monetary limits are adjusted as necessary so as to preserve the level of entitlement.(c) Other Environmental Services: Some fall in standards of services (e.g. refuse and town and country planning).At best no increase in existing staffs. Higher charges for recreational and other facilities.(d) Law, Order and Protective Services: Police numbers would continue to increase, fire service numbers would be heldsteady and the rate of growth of the probation service would be reduced. No new urban programme projectswould be undertaken. Capital expenditure generally would be severely cut back.(e) Education and Libraries: Real increases in school mealcharges. No expansion of nursery education, or further reduction in the size of classes in primary and secondary schools; and severe restrictions on non-teaching costs.Possible failure to meet the full demand for higher education places.(/) Personal Social Services: Minimal growth in expendituretogether with increased demand arising from statutoryduties and demographic changes might result in unutilisednew buildings, curtailment of some services for prioritycategories and further increases in social workers&apos; caseloads.Action needed to restrain expenditure. There is no prospect of local authorities being persuaded to hold their expenditure to the desired level in 1976-77, let alone to
reduce their spending in subsequent years, unless the Governmentmakes the fullest use of the available means of exerting its influence.In particular:(i) Consultative council the authority of the Consultative Council and of itscounterpart in Scotland must be shown to have been putbehind the policy of limiting local authorities&apos; current expenditure in 1976-77 to the aggregate in the tableabove, and behind the policy changes in individual services which are involved in making this possible.(ii) Rate support grants the level of rate support grant would need careful consider-ation since this can affect the level of expenditure.(iii) Guidance on individual services the implications for individual services, and the Govern-menfs acceptance of reduced levels of provision in some services, would have to be spelled out publicly with agreater degree of clarity and harshness than ever before.The same emphasis on restraint in expenditure would haveto be pursued consistently in circulars, in speeches and inmore informal day-to-day guidance to local authorities.(iv) LegislationLegislation giving local authorities new powers, whethermandatory or permissive, would have to be. avoided.(v) ManpowerLocal authorities would have to be brought under pressure to exercise a tighter control over their staff numbers.(vi) Capital expenditureIn determining the capital programme of each service,special care would be needed to minimise any consequentialaddition to recurrent expenditure.(vii) Central Government expenditureIt would have to be apparent that the Government wasexercising a similarly severe attitude towards its ownexpenditure.10. If these conditions were not fulfilled, local authorities mustbe expected to incur current expenditure at levels appreciably higherthan those indicated in this Report. The question calling forconsideration is whether even the maximum use of existing meansof influence can be expected to produce such a sharp reversal of the trend of this spending, which has increased year by year at ratesvarying between 4 and 8 per cent over the past two decades.
11. Departments responsible for the main local servicesconsider that there is little prospect of this radical change, even withthe use of all these methods of influence, unless the Government alsotell local authorities now that there is little prospect of allowing a return to the previous trend of growth in expenditure for several years to come. There will certainly be a need for actual expenditure and staff numbers to be watched carefully, and for the closestco-operation with local authorities, throughout the period.12. The alternative to present means of exerting influencewould be to introduce some direct form of control. It would be inappropriate in this Report to attempt an assessment of the merits of such a change in the relationship between central and local governments. But it is relevant to note that, in the view of theDepartments concerned, the initial problems of introducing controls over local authority current expenditure as a whole would be such that this would be less likely to prove effective even in terms ofrestraining expenditure during the first two or three years thanexisting means of influence.
ANNEX the construction industryConstruction and the associated building materials industries havea weight of over 17 per cent in the index of industrial production.Over 40 per cent of building output and 90 per cent of civil engineer-ing work is for public sector clients.2. The surge of demand from 1971 to 1973, which was accompaniedby rises in tender prices which were very steep for some types ofbuilding work, has been followed by an exceptionally sharp fall in demand. Output in 1974 was 8  per cent down on 1973 levels the greatest fall of the post-war period and a further A\ per centdecline is expected in 1975.Recent conditions3. Public works orders in the nine months October 1973 to June1974 were 40 per cent below those for the previous nine months.After some recovery later on last year they have declined again.Private sector orders also fell away at the end of 1973 and have remained exceptionally low. Public housing orders however haveshown an upward trend through the last twelve months. The index of all new construction work outstanding fell by 20 per cent betweenmid-1973 and the end of last year.4. All this has had the expected result on output which is now about 15 per cent below potential capacity. Output of the building materials industry fell by 12 per cent in 1974 from its 1973 peak,with particularly steep falls for house-building materials and produc-tion has continued at a low level.5. Registered unemployment of adult male construction workersreached a record level of 158,000 (Great Britain, seasonally adjusted)in June 1975. Since October 1973 there has been a fall of 100,000employees in employment and an estimated decrease of 60,000self-employed operatives.6. The rate of tender price increases, adjusted for Variation of price (VOP) payments has slowed from an average of 37 per cent a year during 1972 and 1973 to 7 per cent between the fourthquarter of 1973 and the first quarter of 1975 for PSA buildingtender prices. This has resulted in the implied margin of tenderprices over building costs falling to a level more consistent withthe long-term average mark-up. On the basis of figures availableto the Price Commission profit margins for construction as a wholeseem to have fallen to below levels previously regarded as normal.
Prospects for the construction industry a.. Output7. The following table shows the latest forecasts of output in theconstruction industry, 1975-76 to 1979-80, by sector-building and civil engineering and types of purchases. For sectors other thanhousing, the public sector forecasts are based on figures in theprogramme tables shown in this report, and the private sector fore-casts are consistent with the MTA. The housing forecasts maydiffer from MTA, in particular for intermediate years, for examplebecause of uncertainties on the impact of mortgage stabilisationpolicy. The chart on page 37 shows quarterly movements in out-put over the period 1975-76 to 1979-80 for building, civil engineering and total output.8. Given the planned 1975-76 expenditure programme, new ordersfor public sector non-housing are expected to rise sharply for therest of the year. Consequently output for this sector is forecast torise by 4 per cent in 1976-77 (to a level %\ per cent below 1973-74).From 1976-77 onwards, output is forecast to decline, levelling offtowards 1980.9. Housing output will show an increase, but at a diminishing ratefrom 1975-76 onwards. Both private industrial output (includingoil contracts) and private commercial output are expected from theMTA to be on a steep upward trend from 1977-78. By 1979-80output from these two sectors taken together is projected to be31 per cent up on 1975-76 and 13 per cent above the peak year 1973.Repair and maintenance output is expected to increase from 1976-77onwards.10. The outlook is for total construction output to fall by 2 percent in 1975-76, recover by 3 per cent in 1976-77 and to increase by a further 5 per cent in 1977-78 and by nearly 3 per cent eachyear in the last two years of the period. Within the total the profilefor building and civil engineering will be different: the first fallinga further 4 per cent in 1975-76 and increasing fairly steadily in eachof the subsequent years and civil engineering output, while growingup to 1976-77, looks like being on a slightly falling trend towardsthe end of the period.b. Possible constraints11. The industry could run into supply problems if capacity is reduced as a result of continued lack of confidence because the recession is too prolonged and if the subsequent recovery is toorapid. The danger areas are skilled workers, cement, constructional
steelwork and bricks if productive capacity is taken out of commis-sion this year or next. A high level of closures of both cementand brick works has already occurred.12. On the demand side Local Authorities&apos; desire to avoid furthersharp increases in rates, could involve building expenditure pro-grammes being pruned to below the amounts implied by the Survey.Summary of prospects13. The trough of the construction industry recession is expectedduring the course of this year with output 13 per cent below the peak 1973 level. 200,000 jobs have been already lost in construction and the associated building materials industries since the 1973 peakand if output per man recovers from present low levels the numberof lost jobs may well rise to about 300,000 by the end of 1975-76.From 1976-77 output is projected to rise slowly at first but then toincrease by 5 per cent in 1977-78 and by nearly 3 per cent eachyear for the last two years, reaching in 1979-80 a level marginallyabove 1973.

ANNEX EExpenditure in Cost and Demand TermsFigures for the main Survey programmes in volume terms are shownin Table A and corresponding figures in cost terms, adjusted for therelative price effect (RPE) are shown in the table on page 40. As men-tioned in paragraph 14 of Part I the adjustment for the RPE allows forthe fact that prices do not all change at the same rate. An adjust-ment is made separately for each economic category. For the pastyears the change in the RPE reflects how prices have in fact moved,whereas in future years an allowance is made normally on the basisof past long-term trends, though in some cases a special allowance is made where prices are thought not to be on the long-term trend.Thus wages and salaries tend to move faster than prices in generaland this means that growth rates in cost terms are normally faster than growth rates in volume terms. The sharp relative increase in public sector pay in 1974-75 was an important factor leading tothe high RPE that year. A further major influence on the size ofthe RPE has been the movement of construction prices. following the sharp relative rise in 1973-74 and 1974-75 a relative declineis expected over the Survey period and this means that the RPEis lower than might have been expected on the basis of long-termtrends.2. As the importance of the various economic categories variesbetween the different programmes, the adjustment for the RPE hasa disproportionate effect on different programmes. For example, in programmes which are labour intensive, such as education and health and personal social services, the RPE adjustment makes a largepositive addition to the growth rate in volume terms (plus2 per cent a year for health and plus 1 per cent for educationbetween 1974-75 and 1979-80), whereas for programmes with alarge construction element such as roads and housing, the growth rate in cost terms is below that in volume terms (less 0-8 per cent a year for roads and less 2 - 2 per cent for housing).3. It is also possible to adjust the Survey figures to take account ofthe demand content of expenditure, making separate adjustments for different economic categories. Thus in 1974-75 the growth rate in demand terms was lower than that in cost terms because among other things the fastest growth that year was in subsidies whichhave a relatively low demand weight. In 1975-76 and subsequent years, subsidies are expected to decline, as are net lending to the
private sector and net purchases of land (also with low demandweights). The major economic categories which are fast-growingand with high demand weights are current expenditure on goods and services and investment in plant and machinery. This means that, in total, the growth in demand terms betv/een 1974-75 and1979-80 is higher than that in volume or cost terms.

As a result of the Defence Review and the savings for 1976-77 announced in the 1975 budget statement, planned Defence Budget provision hasbeen reduced by over  2 billion over the period1976-77 to 1979-80; overseas commitments outsideNATO have been cut, and within NATO our forces have been reduced to what was considered by theGovernment to be the essential minimum consistent with NATO strategy.3. Within the financial provision estimated in theDefence Review as necessary for this level of support for NATO, costs in respect of residual non-NATOcommitments and a rounding-down of the defence review costings have had to be absorbed; inaddition, the Budget cut for 1976-77 has had to be accomodated. The total of these adjustments was estimated to be some  550 million by 1979-80. Thenecessary savings are to be achieved by a combina-tion of savings in the support area (including civilianmanpower), in works services, and in stores and supplies, and by some additional cuts in or defer-ments of equipment. These measures will, in thelong run, affect the quality of our essential minimumcontribution to NATO.4. The Defence Budget targets as a result of theDefence Review, revalued to 1975 Survey prices,are:  million7977-75	1978-79	1979-80. 4,725	4,723	4,694The Secretary of State for Defence undertook in cabinet on 10th April to attempt to accelerate the savings after 1976-77 resulting from the defence review. But the main Review measures e.g. ahalving of the air transport force and reductions inamphibious shipping, destroyers/frigates and minecountermeasure vessels will have been made by april 1976. The reductions in uniformed manpowerprovided for in the Review will have been largelyachieved by the end of 1976-77, except in the caseof the army, for which commitments in Germanyand Northern Ireland preclude so fast a rundown.Further savings could be found by acceleratingSECRET
Defence Review measures without operationallyunacceptable consequences in the area of non-NATOand Mediterranean commitments, but assuming theattendant political difficulties could be overcome,and taking into account enhanced offset (para-graph 6 below), these could at most yield further savings of some  85 million a year, which is thebasis of the MOD figures in Table A above.5. The Treasury view is that the savings to be explored in fulfilment of the Secretary of Statevsundertaking should represent reductions in each ofthe later years of the same order as those applied in the 1975 Budget measures to 1976-77; this would imply lowering the Defence Review targets by  125million in 1977-78,  123 million in 1978-79 and 94 million in 1979-80 to the totals in Table 1above. Given the steps needed to get down to theDefence Review targets, and because the rundownin the forces is planned to be largely complete earlyin the Survey period, savings of this order could beachieved only by a combination of:(a) earlier withdrawal from Mediterranean and non-NATO commitments, and additionaloffset to the cost of our forces in Germanyand Hong Kong, and(b) further equipment cuts.6. The Ministry of Defence and the Treasuryagree that earlier withdrawal could at best producesavings in the total annual cost of mediterranean and non-NATO commitments (including Malta) asfollows:  million at 1975 Survey prices(a) Withdrawal from Cyprus byend 1976-77(b) increasing the pace of with-drawal in Malta starting in1977-78(c) Closure of Gibraltar dock-yard by end 1976-77 andretention of minimum naval base facilitiesAn average of 25 million a year from1977-78, net of re-dundancy paymentssay,  2 million a year in1977-78 and 1978-79 4 million in each of1977-78 to 1979-80The current assumption is that offset to the cost of forces in Hong Kong will be some  17 million from1976-77, or about half the cost. If we are successful in our aim of achieving an increase to three-quarters of the cost over a period, this would yield furtheroffset of, say,  2 million in 1977-78,  4 million in1978-79, and  6 million in 1979-80. Budgetarypayments by the Germans under the current offset agreement are some  21 million a year at theexchange rate ruling on 30 June 1975. A successoragreement is due to be negotiated shortly, in whichthe aim would be to increase the current figuresubstantially. The Ministry of Defence savingsimplied in Table A above assume a contribution of  50 million a year.7. The savings in paragraph 6 all present severepolitical and practical difficulties. In the event thatthese difficulties prevented more than, say, a halfor a third of the savings being achieved, to bringthe Defence Budget totals down to the Treasuryfigures in Table 1 above, it would entail cuttingup to  100 million a year from the equipment programme.8. It is common ground between the Ministry ofDefence and the Treasury that equipment savings of this order would mean eroding the front linecapabilities which were decided on in the defence review. Reductions in the front line could notbe concealed -from our allies. The political, militaryand industrial consequences would need to be weighed against the financial savings.Formula reductions9. Reductions in the Defence Budget comparable to those sought by the formula applied to civilprogrammes would entail reductions of  220 million in 1977-78,  450 million in 1978-79, and  530million in 1979-80. These would be additional tothe Defence Review savings for those years, which amount to some  430 million,  610 million and 760 million respectively, without taking account ofthe costs of the residual non-NATO commitments and the PESC roundings, which have had to heabsorbed (see paragraph 3 above). Further reduc-tions of up to  530 million a year could onlybe found at the expense of the core of our NATOcommitted forces, including major elements of thefront line. The outcome could be a reduction inthe number of uniformed Service personnel by a quarter to a third, with a cut of front-line forces,including BAOR and major front-line operationalships and aircraft of the Navy and the RAF, bya third to a half. The judgment reached in thecourse of the Defence Review by the Governmentwas that reductions of this order would mean a fundamental change in our defence policy, basedon support of NATO as the linch-pin of our security, and have the most serious military andpolitical implications for NATO.

The Aid Programme was cut in the last Budgetby  13 million this year and by  13-1 million in1976-77. The rate of increase between these twoyears is now 2-5 per cent but the average annual rate of increase for the years beyond 1976-77 isabout 0-9 per cent. The average annual rate of increase now proposed for the whole PESC period is 1-3 per cent, compared with a figure of 3-3 per cent in the period covered in Cmnd. 5789.2. In 1974, the Government accepted in principle the United Nations target of 0-7 per cent of gnp for official development assistance, andalthough no undertakings have been given aboutthe date of reaching this target and it has beenmade clear that progress must be subject both tothe pace of the United Kingdom&apos;s economic recovery and to the other calls on our resources,they have said that in the years ahead they will seek to move towards it. Our performance in1974 was 0-38 per cent (compared with 0-35 percent in 1973). Accurate forecasts of our per-formance are virtually impossible, but although we are still likely to be ahead of most other majordonors, at best we are unlikely to improve on this figure with the provision shown above, and at worstour performance is likely to go down.3. The Ministry of Overseas Development donot claim that the revised figures proposed for1977-78 onwards would produce a situation inwhich they would be unable to fulfil all of theirexisting specific commitments to the developing countries. But the prospects for the poorestdeveloping countries have deteriorated so much,especially through the effects of the oil crisis, thatthe Ministry foresee calls on the United kingdom for new and increased aid. Government spokesmenfor the United Kingdom have unequivocally alignedSECRET
themselves with other advocates of more aid for the poorest countries, particularly those hardest hit byoil and other commodity prices. They have saidthat provided there is substantial support fromother donors, especially the oil producers, we will support with funds from the Aid Programme theproposals for a Special Trust Fund for the poorest countries (i.e. with incomes under $200 per capita),for subsidies of the interest payable on drawingsby poor countries from the IMF oil facility andfrom the IBRD &quot;Third Window&quot; and for anInternational Fund for Agricultural Development.Aid through the European Economic Community,which is substantial, is attributable to the aid programme and unlike unattributed e.c. Expendi-ture under Programme 2-7, is not exempt from theproposed cuts under the &quot; ground rules &quot;. these and other potential new commitments could hardly be avoided without breach of international good faith. In the Ministry&apos;s view the proposed cuts would make it very difficult to meet all suchcommitments whilst preserving the necessaryelement of flexibility in the Aid Programme.4. It is the view of the Ministry of overseas development that the proposed cuts would providegrounds for criticism of the United Kingdom bothdomestically and internationally at a time whenthe Western World is trying to establish a newdialogue with the developing countries in the context of the New International Economic Order.Overseas representation5. This expenditure includes the cost of the foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London, Britishdiplomatic and consular representation in some 120countries and eight official delegations to inter-national organisations and conferences. It coversexpenditure on staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as office and residential accommodation abroad, official travel, and support-ing services. Also included is the cost of the Pass-port Offices in London and other centres and the communications organisation in support of the diplomatic Service.6. Overseas representation is labour-intensive and much of the expenditure is staff-related. The Diplo-matic Service has already been reduced in size byabout 13 per cent since 1965 (including reductionsrecommended in the Duncan Report of 1969).Increasing commitments have had to be met at theexpense of the manpower margin which the PlowdenReport considered vital in an overseas service(Cmnd. 2276, paragraphs 86-90).7. The FCO consider that at the 1976-77 level ofexpenditure existing policies could be broadly main-tained, though with some staff redundancies and areduction in services. Thereafter the scale of Diplo-matic Service commitments would have to be pro-gressively reduced worldwide to contain expenditure within the decreasing resources available. Optionsconsidered include withdrawal from areas of lowerpriority (i.e. closure of posts), cuts in the size of allremaining posts, and staff cuts at home. The totalstaff employed at home and overseas at present isabout 8,600 United Kingdom-based and 8,250locally-employed; the total number of career officesis 229 (of which 124 are Embassies and High Corn-missions, 97 consular offices and 8 delegations to international organisations). The reductions sug-gested below are at this stage essentially illustrative:the actual pattern, if the financial savings postulatedwere to be implemented, would be a matter for political decision. Even the least damaging combina-tion would require a cutback of the following order:(a) By 1977-78 it would be necessary to closeabout 10 Embassies/High Commissions and about 15 consular offices, with a saving ofover 65 United Kingdom-based staff, and tomake even greater staff cuts elsewhere athome and abroad. It would also be necessaryto close several consular offices with locally-engaged staff only. Altogether nearly 450United Kingdom-based and nearly 500locally-engaged jobs would be lost withcorrespondingly heavy redundancies.(b) By 1978-79 over 20 Embassies/High Commis-sions and 35 consular offices would have tobe closed with a total saving of about 170United Kingdom-based staff. About 700United Kingdom-based jobs would also gofrom other posts abroad and at home.Altogether more than 850 United Kingdom-based jobs would be eliminated (with up to50 per cent redundancies) and upwards of 900locally-engaged staff paid off.(c) By 1979-80 closures would reach over 25Embassies/High Commissions and 40 con-sular offices, with a total saving of about240 United Kingdom-based staff. Theseclosures would represent about a quarter
of all career offices. In addition, about 800United Kingdom-based jobs would have to be saved at other posts abroad and at home.All told, more than 1,000 United Kingdom-based jobs would have to be eliminated (one-eighth of the present strength) with a high proportion of redundancies. Locally-engagedstaff abroad would also have to be cut by over 1,300 (about one-sixth); and since allwould become redundant, the cost of sever-ance payments would be heavy.8. Although closures would naturally be concen-trated on posts of lower significance for UnitedKingdom commercial and other interests, neverthe-less the aggregate effect of closures and staff reduc-tions at home and abroad, on the rising scalepostulated, would inevitably restrict the ability ofthe Diplomatic Service to carry out Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s policies throughout the world.(a) There would be restrictions over the wholefield of activities, as well as in the conduct ofbusiness with foreign governments and inter-national organisations.(b) In many countries which are individually of secondary importance but collectively signi-significant as part of the Third World, the UnitedKingdom would be represented from a neigh-bouring country, and Diplomatic Serviceactivity in those countries would be largelydiscontinued. Diplomatic Service activity inall remaining countries would also be reduced.(c) In all countries from which representation was withdrawn, the provision of consular services to British subjects (e.g. protection of legalrights, issue of passports, repatriation) would cease. In those countries where Consulateswere closed, service to the public woulddeteriorate. Passport offices in the UnitedKingdom would be unable to maintainpresent standards of service.(d) Even such activities as export promotion,which currently receive high priority in termsof staff effort, would be curtailed in certain areas and eliminated in those countries fromwhich missions were withdrawn. So wouldother work done on behalf of Home Depart-ments such as aid and immigration, whetherby Diplomatic Service officers or by home civil Servants seconded to the FCO.SECRET9. Plans for necessary modernisation of the FCOglobal communications system (which also servesother Government Departments) would have to be deferred at the cost of prospective staff savings whilethe effectiveness of the present system would besteadily eroded. The 10-year purchasing and build-ing programme for the Diplomatic Estate announced to Parliament in 1971 would be substantially slowed down and we would be increasingly vulnerable toconstantly rising rents. Maintenance of the existingestate would suffer.Overseas information10.   This covers three main elements:(a) British Council expenditure to promote widerknowledge of the United Kingdom and theEnglish language abroad and to foster culturalrelations with other countries. (Theremainder of the CounciPs expenditure is included in Overseas Aid.)(b) The cost of the BBCs External Services andassociated expenditure on British broadcastingdirected to other countries.(c) The cost of FCO information staff at homeand abroad and their operational expenses,and of supporting services of the central office of Information (COI) and the stationery office.11. As indicated in Cmnd. 5879, this programme has already been cut by  1 -5 million a year (at 1974Survey prices) from 1975-76 onwards. The reducedprovision shown in the table would progressivelyaccentuate the downward trend in activity and seriously damage the whole range of activities, tosuch an extent that even information support forthe national export effort would be affected.12. In 1976-77 across the board cuts would have tobe made, including reductions in vernacular broad-casting to Western and Eastern Europe, the near east, South Asia and the Far East. The cut-backwould have to be applied from 1977-78 onwardswith increasing severity. By 1979-80:(i) British Council representation would haveto be closed down in some 15 out of 83countries and activity reduced in as many more. This would eliminate some 140United Kingdom-based jobs, most of whichwould involve redundancies, and about 200local employees abroad would have to be_I
discharged. A total of 960 United Kingdom-based and 1,195 locally-employed staff areborne on the overseas information pro-gramme.(ii) BBC vernacular services would have to bedrastically pruned: the number of vernacularservices would be reduced by between 15to 20 out of the present 39, with a consequent reduction of between 30 per cent and 35per cent in total vernacular broadcasting hours. Expenditure on Relay Stations wouldalso be cut back, thereby reducing effectivebroadcast coverage of the Near East, and throughout Asia and Australasia. All told,nearly 400 External Services jobs would be cut, about one-sixth of the total.(iii) FCO and COI Information Services wouldbe reduced in parallel. It is estimated thatin 1979-80 reductions in COI staff couldbe up to 100 out of a total of 830 staffdevoted to overseas activities. The effectsfor the FCO staff have already been allowed for in paragraph 3 above. (The FCO totalsof United Kingdom-based and locally-engaged staff borne on the overseas information programme are 374 and 1,020respectively.) These reductions wouldinvolve cutting not only a wide range of activities projecting Britain abroad, includingthe sponsoring of influential overseas visitors to this country, but could not avoid affectingpublicity for exports. It would also involvethe closure of the Wilton Park conferencecentre.Other external relations13. This item consists mainly of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to international organisations such as the United Nations andNATO and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs other international commitments. By their nature thesecannot be reduced unilaterally. This expenditure isnone the less subject to constant scrutiny with a viewto achieving the maximum economy consistent with her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs international obliga-tions.14. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs contribution tothe support of the United Nations Emergency Forcein the Middle East has been included for 1975-76only.   Provision for the United Nations Force in cyprus has been made at current force levels for1975-76. Thereafter the figures in the table havebeen provisionally based on pre-July 1974 forcelevels.15. The forecast provides for the grant-in-aid tothe Commonwealth War Graves Commission to bereduced from  3-2 million in 1976-77 to  3 million in 1977-78 and  2-9 million in 1978-79 and1979-80. But the Commission argue that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s 76 - 96 per cent share of their expenditure is fixed, being based on the number of graves, andthat they have already reduced their expendituressignificantly. A cut of the size postulated would, intheir view, make it impossible to carry out their functions properly.Military aid16. This heading covers military trainingassistance, which provides for courses in theUnited Kingdom for the Service personnel of othercountries, the provision of British Service personnel on loan to developing (mainly Commonwealth)countries, and a small amount of police training,particularly in South-East Asia.17. A cut of about 50 per cent in military trainingassistance from 1975-76 to 1978-79 was reflected in Cmnd. 5879 figures. The level of expenditurein the table assumes further significant reductionsfrom 1975-76 to 1979-80.Contributions to the European Communities, etc.(net)18. This comprises United Kingdom contributions to the European Communities&apos; budget (excludingamounts attributed to aid and other programmes);capital contributions to the European InvestmentBank (including an allowance for the forthcomingincrease in capital, but excluding any allowance for any maintenance of value payments arisingfrom a new unit of account) and receipts by theUnited Kingdom public sector from the Com-munities&apos; budget.19. The forecasts have been built up by applying the forecast United Kingdom percentage share ofthe Communities&apos; budget in each year to estimates of the cost of carrying out existing Communitypolicies.    The United kingdom&apos;s  share of the
budget rises to 19-24 per cent in 1977 and will increase progressively in 1978 and 1979 as theUnited Kingdom moves to the full own resourcessystem in 1980.) 20. The provision for the United Kingdom&apos;contribution towards the cost of Euratom andenergy research and development projects takes account only of present commitments, some ofwhich terminate at the end of 1976 or in 1977. Ifthese programmes were to be extended, the addi-tional cost to the United Kingdom would represent a claim against the contingency reserves.The forecast for the market support (i.e. Guarantee)section of the Common Agricultural Policy hasbeen made on the basis of the support policies asthey now stand; it does not take account of possiblepolicy changes which might arise in the future,e.g. from the current CAP stocktaking exercise.The forecasts for receipts (including receipts fromthe Budget Correcting Mechanism at the end of the survey period) are based on best estimates of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s share of receipts. Conversionsfrom units of account into  s have been made atthe present budget unit of account rate of 2-4units of account to the  .21. The forecasts are slightly lower than those in cmnd. 5879. This mainly results from a higher level of United Kingdom receipts forecast from themarket support section of the CAP.22. The table below gives a breakdown of the forecast United Kingdom contribution to and receipts from the Community budget in the period1975-76 to 1979-80. The figures for the net con-tribution shown in the last line include community budget expenditure attributed to other programmes,but they exclude capital contributions to the Euro-pean Investment Bank which is not part of theCommunity Budget; they cannot, therefore, be corn-pared with the figures quoted in Table 2.  million at 1975 Survey prices1975 1976 1977 1978 1979-76    -77    -78    -79    -80United Kingdom contributionAdministration,    Miscel-laneous,   Payment   of&quot; Own Resources &quot;collection costs, etc.Support for HydrocarbonsProspectingEuratom, etc.Social Fund  .Regional development fund ....European .

During the survey period the transition to fullCommunity support levels under the common agricultural Policy will be completed. By 1978-79,at the latest, market support for most agricultural products will be provided entirely by Communitymeasures, old style United Kingdom price guaranteescontinuing only for the products which may still remain outside the CAP. National schemesproviding direct support through production and capital grants will continue throughout the periodalongside similar Community measures but thecapital grants are already operated within Com-munity regulations or conform to rules governingnational aids. It is against this general backgroundthat the agricultural support projections for theperiod have to be determined.2. The projections affected by CAP policies havebeen based on those policies as they now stand, butit has been assumed that the beef support regime,introduced last February for a year in the first place,will be continued by the Community throughout theperiod.
3. In the case of fisheries support, future develop-ments in the Common Fisheries Policy may have some effect on the level of capital grants but the consequence for expenditure under this head is not likely to be very significant.4. Expenditure in Northern Ireland on price guarantees and cn production and capital supportmeasures and on support in special areas is includedin Table 15, Northern Ireland.Application of the ground rules5. Expenditure on support for agriculture andfisheries is not subject to the percentage reductionsfrom 1976-77. These apply to other assistance to agriculture, food processing and marketing (exceptfor animal disease measures) and central and miscellaneous services: this block involves expendi-ture of about  98 million of which nearly two-thirdsrelates to the agricultural research and advisoryservices. Under the ground rules, following the reductions already decided for 1976-77, further reductions of  4-9 million and  9-7 million arerequired for 1977-78 and 1978-79 respectively.6. Substantial cuts in the research and advisoryservices would seriously reduce their effectivenessand this would conflict with the medium term policyof selective expansion outlined in &quot; Food From OurOwn Resources&quot; (Cmnd. 6020). The agricultural departments accordingly consider that the scale ofthe research and advisory services should not bereduced or at least should not bear the whole burdenof the savings required. Savings of about  1 - 7 mil-lion a year can be found from other functions andgeneral administration without any unacceptable lossof administrative efficiency. In terms of equivalentdemand effect this would leave savings of  4-4 mil-lion in 1977-78 and  11-6 million in 1978-79 tobe secured in agricultural support.7. The introduction of the new beef support regime,for which substantial provision has now been madethroughout the Survey period, offers the possibility of finding the necessary savings under the production grants head. Revision of the beef cow and/orcalf subsidies after 1977 could provide in 1977-78and 1978-79 the balance of the percentage reductionsneeded under the ground rules. DAFS and DANIrecognise that to the extent that the percentagereductions are not met from the areas to which theyinitially apply under the ground rules they will haveto be found elsewhere and that this unavoidablySECRETleads to savings in production grants. It is, however,the view of DAFS and DANI that the essential condition which must be met to make these savingsacceptable through cuts in the beef cow and calfsubsidies is that the agreement of the e.c. is securedto the continuation throughout the Survey period of beef support arrangements of the form recently introduced which will be satisfactory for UnitedKingdom producers when coupled with the transitionto common price levels.8. The Treasury consider that, provided the currentCommunity beef regime is continued at the nextCAP Price Review, earlier termination of the beefcow subsidy should be considered at the next annual review.9. In the last two public expenditure White Papersit was assumed that transition to full CAP supportlevels would make savings of  20 million a year from1976-77 onwards under this head. These savingswere on a United Kingdom basis but were not atthe time allocated between Great Britain andNorthern Ireland. If the production grant savingsmentioned above are set against the ground rulesreductions, the  20 million savings (in production grants) assumed in previous White Papers can be matched by reductions under another head, i.e.cereals price guarantees. For the 1975 crop the gap between the level of these guarantees and of CAPsupport prices is so narrow that significant expendi-ture in 1976-77 is not expected, provided that CAPsupport is effective in putting a floor in the marketat the intervention level. Following the recentchange in the United Kingdom representative rate,the cereals guarantee will be terminated after the1975 crop, and there will therefore be no expenditureafter 1976-77.10. In the tables it has been assumed that the cap beef regime now operating will continue andthat policy decisions will be taken to reduce expenditure on production grants (beef cow andcalf subsidies) by  6-4 million in 1977-78 and 11-6 million in 1978-79 (of which  1-6 million and  2-4 million would apply to Northern Ireland).As explained in paragraph 9, there will be no expen-diture, in these years, on the cereals guarantee. Theprojections for 1979-80 represent the estimated expenditure which would result from the continua-tion in that year of the modified, policies. Thefollowing paragraphs draw attention to the main features of the individual programmes.11
Market Regulation under the CAP11. This heading relates to United Kingdompayments made by the Intervention Board to implement Guarantee Section (market support)measures under the CAP and the e.c. Food aid programme. Most of the expenditure is financed from the Community Budget (FEOGA); receiptsto this end are shown in Table 2. The forecast for 1975-76 includes  93 million for the grosscost of the beef premium scheme, of which  43million will be financed by FEOGA and thebalance by the United Kingdom. Adopting normalSurvey conventions these amounts have beenprojected over the five-year period on the assump-tion the Community will agree to continue thescheme in broadly its present form. In 1975-76 110 million has been included for Monetary Com-pensatory Amounts which are financed by FEOGA.For the later years it has been assumed that MCAswill continue but at a somewhat lower rate than in1975-76. (About 90 per cent of MRCA payments areof direct benefit to consumers rather than producers.)Price guarantees12. For reasons already explained, there willbe no further significant expenditure on cerealsguarantees. This results in reductions of  52million in 1976-77,  44 million in 1977-78 and 22 million in 1978-79. The cost to the exchequer of implementing the milk guarantee is borne by thefood subsidies programme and is shown under thathead. For price guarantees of products not coveredby the CAP (sheep, wool and potatoes) the normalSurvey convention is adopted of projecting theestimated expenditure in the current year whichreflects decisions in the 1975 Annual Review.Production grants and subsidies13. There are four production grant schemessupporting beef. Two are CAP measures the dairy Herd Conversion Scheme which has been closed to further entrants but which will never-theless lead to payments until 1978-79, and the beefguidance premia payable under the Farm andHorticulture Development Scheme to farmers con-concentrating on beef production. The other two schemes, which are on a substantially larger scale,are the United Kingdom beef cow and calf subsidieswhich are discussed in paragraph 7.14. The projections for capital grants and for support in special (hill) areas assume a continuation of present policies, including the increased rate ofhill sheep subsidy announced following the 1975Annual Review. Some revisions may be needed totake full account of the e.c. directive on lessfavoured areas but variations in expenditure are unlikely to be very significant.Other expenditure by the Agricultural Departments15. The three main, continuing, blocks of expendi-ture under this head relate to the research and advisory services (including the agricultural collegesin Scotland); the eradication and control of animaldiseases; and central and miscellaneous services.The reducing level of expenditure over the survey period is mainly due to the brucellosis programme which is planned to secure progressive eradication.Additionally in 1975-76 provision is included for the guaranteed price to ACP producers for sugar shippedto the United Kingdom during 1975: the cost of thisremains uncertain but provision of  105 million hasbeen included in Table 3.Food subsidies16. The reductions in public expenditure in1976-77 announced in April included a reductionof  150 million (at 1974 Survey prices) in the planned provision for food subsidies. The groundrules for this year&apos;s Survey required that at aminimum this reduction should be carried throughinto later years but also provided for the possibilityof further savings to be explored.17. Ministers have now decided to moderate therate of rundown of the programme in 1976-77,with no start to phasing out this year. The white paper, &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot;, Cmnd. 6151,states that  70 million is to be added to the provisionpreviously made for 1976-77. The figures flowingfrom the ground rules, adjusted by these decisions,have been shown in the tables. This leads to higherfigures for 1975-76 ( 565 million) and 1976-77 ( 393million) but the provision for the remaining threeyears of the Survey period is unchanged. TheDPCP have asked to have recorded their viewthat the restoration of the  70 million for theprogramme, announced in Cmnd. 6151, should beassumed to be at 1974 prices. This would add afurther  14 million to the 1976-77 figure in the table.18. The resulting projections would mean, par-ticularly in cash terms, a substantial level ofexpenditure throughout the period of the Survey.
The Governments stated intention is progressivelyto phase out food subsidies and in the Treasury&apos;view an alternative option which should be con-sidered is that phasing out will be achieved by1979-80, subject to residual provision in that yearI to cover contingencies notably the United King-dom share of the cost of Community food subsidies.This would imply a sharper rate of rundown inthe last two years of the Survey period as in thefollowing projections:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80565	393	250	150	50This would mean two steps down of about  150million, followed by two of about  100 million.DPCP are unable to agree to these projections since in their view they allow insufficient scope for flexi-bility in planning the latter stages of the rundownand could prejudice continuing support for a volun-tary incomes policy.Support for the fishing industry19. Estimates over the Survey period provide forthe continuation of existing capital grant schemes.Provision in 1975-76 also includes the cost of thetemporary operating subsidy for the period january to June 1975.Forestry20. The demand upon resources is measured by thecost of capital employed by the Forestry Commis-sion at the ruling Government rates of interest andby cash expenditure. Towards the cost of capital employed there is a subsidy to cover the differencebetween the target rate of return of 3 per cent set by the Government and the ruling Government lend-ing rate and there are other subsidies on activities which are not capable of producing the target ratebut which the Commission undertakes for socialreasons.21. Application of the ground rules necessitatedcuts of  1 -1 million in 1977-78 ( 0-1 million current 1-0 million capital) and  1-6 million in 1978-79( 0-2 million current  1-4 million capital). these have been achieved on research and development(current) and on land acquisitions and new construc-tion (capital).22. Various estimating changes arising out of factors not within the Commission^ control (e.g. thefall in demand for timber reduces income and changes in the ruling Government rates of interestproduce an automatic change in the remission ofinterest) are unavoidable in themselves and beyondthe Commission^ ability to find offsetting changesbecause of the fluctuating and disruptive effect onprogrammes. Reductions, however, have beenpossible in the ancillary work for the establishment and maintenance of plantations; some rephasing ofthe land acquisitions programme to give a level run of figures has the effect of fully offsetting a small increase in 1976-77 with reductions in 1977-78 and1978-79. The net effect of all these changes is toincrease the annual totals by  1-9 million in1976-77,  1-4 million in 1977-78 and  1-0 million in 1978-79.23. The application of the rules reverses the recentexpansion in the development of recreation facilities and the cut in research and development expendi-ture reduces the research effort in the improvementof planting stock and crop yields, in soil studies on coal tips and other difficult sites, and other long-termstudies.24. Apparent increases, ranging from  4-2 million in 1975-76 to  7-0 million in 1979-80, in the totalexpenditure over that shown in previous returnsarises solely from a change in classification to reflect normal National Accounts principles. Thenet profit on the Commission Trading Accounts isnow shown as part of the Gross Trading Surplus.(Previously the profit from the Trading Accounts was already included in the total expenditure.) This doesnot lead to an increase in the cash requirement.SECRET13

These are new provisions. The figures representexpenditure programmes of  200 million for theScottish Development Agency (SDA) and  100 mil-lion for the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) (thefigures to which Ministers agreed at IDV (75) 3rdMeeting) over five years. The main objectives of the agencies will be to accelerate the economic andindustrial development of Scotland and Wales andto improve the environment consistently with thatobjective. In particular they will have the task of planning, developing, maintaining, and managingGovernment-owned industrial estates in Scotland andWales and of providing advance and purpose builtfactories. This calls for expanding programmes ofexpenditure. The Agencies will also expand thederelict land clearance programmes where it is envisaged present and planned levels of work willbe increased and they will undertake major environ-mental schemes. They will also carry out inScotland and in Wales the regional developmentfunctions of the National Enterprise Board.3. The Welsh Office regard these figures with con-cern as a significant part of the proposed expenditure is already pre-empted by commitments entered intomainly to lessen the adverse effects of the Ebbw Valesteel closure programme.Policy option4. It would be possible to spread the expenditure of 200 million in Scotland and  100 million in Walesover six rather than five years, with savings of 37-4 million and  15-9 million respectively overthe Survey period.Regional development grants5. Regional development grants have been availableonly since 1972 and previous estimates were affectedby the lack of statistical data, as well as the inherentuncertainties in forecasting eligible investment.Although more statistics are now available the fore-casts, which are substantially lower than in Cmnd.5879, are still subject to a wide margin or erroreither way.Policy option6. In terms of policy options which might achievesubstantial savings, the most obvious method in this area would be a cut across the board in rates of grant (currently 22 per cent in special development areas and 20 per cent in development areas and on buildings only in intermediate areas). A cut of fourpercentage points could save up to  25 million thefirst year after the change and eventually  50 million a year. This could be done by Order. This would,however, mean a significant weakening of theGovernment^ regional policies and would also run counter to the aim of keeping regional incentivesstable so far as possible. Neither Department ofIndustry nor Treasury officials would wish torecommend it.Provision of land and building7. The present policy of land acquisition andadvance factory building and the criteria for pro-viding factories  to  industry&apos;s  requirements  are
assumed to continue. The forecasts are substantially above Cmnd. 5879 due mainly to revised estimates ofinterest on capital employed and depreciation and because fewer sales are now expected, though thepolicy of seeking sales will continue.Selective assistance to industry in assisted areas8. It is assumed that Section 7 will continue to bethe main source of selective financial assistance for employment-creating projects in the assisted areas and for maintaining employment in those areas incases where there would otherwise be redundancies.The forecasts are based on continuation of thepresent criteria but will be affected by factors whichare difficult to quantify. For example, industry&apos;sdifficulty in obtaining credit from the private sectorcould lead to greater demand for loans rather thaninterest relief grants, and the forecasts are generallysensitive to developments in the economy as a whole.The question of control over expenditure under this programme is to be the subject of further discussion between the Treasury and Departments and this may affect the figures.Special assistance for rural and highland areas9. The provision covers the grant-in-aid to the highlands and Islands Development Board; it hasbeen carefully considered and in the department^view, bearing in mind that from 16th May 1975 theBoard&apos;s area has been extended, there is no scope for reductions beyond some savings that have beenmade primarily to offset additional expenditure on a subsidy to Caledonian MacBrayne.10. The forecasts for the Development Commissionprovide for the same level of expenditure as Cmnd.5879. Because the current Scottish expenditure ofthe Fund is being taken on by the Scottish Develop-ment Agency without a PESC transfer there couldbe a potential saving in the region of  0-9 million.But expansions in the Development Commission^activities which have been agreed in the past havenot been fully reflected in PESC provisions and themaintenance of activity at its existing levels would absorb all these savings. The expansion of activities in Scotland and Wales is being financed from SDAand WDA funds and to leave the PESC figure even at its present level would mean the abandonment inEngland of any intensification of programmesapproved by Ministers in November 1974 (EC (74)18th Meeting). To fulfil this remit satisfactorilywould require additional amounts of about  5 mil-lion for each year from 1976-77 onwards.SECRETRegional employment premium11. Provision has been made for continuing topay the premium at current money levels to manufacturing industry in development areas.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of theLocal Employment Act 197212. The expenditure is for outstanding commit-ments under the Act.INDUSTRIAL INNOVATIONIndustrial Research Establishments and Computer-Aided Design CentreIndustrial  research  and  development  contracts,grants and other support13. Expenditure by the Department of industry on these two sub-programmes is treated as a management budget (i.e. a net budget within a fixed ceiling). It is assumed that activity at theIndustrial Research Establishments (IREs), nowlargely directed by Requirements Boards, will con-tinue to be supported at the current level in1975-76 with some growth in later years. In theyears from 1976-77 onwards capital expenditure forthe IREs is expected to remain in line with the1974 Survey.14. The main expenditure on research anddevelopment contracts with industry, which are usually conducted on a cost-sharing basis, is onShip and Marine Technology; it is expected thatthis work will continue to grow during the survey period. Expenditure on research work by universities-ties and other bodies will fall below the 1974Survey figures by amounts ranging from  1-5 million in 1975-76 to  4-2 million in 1978-79.The Department^ support for the research associations (which was increased substantially inthe 1974 Survey) now mainly takes the form of research contracts rather than, as formerly, grants.15. There is also expenditure on industrial research and development contracts, grants andother support outside the management budget and controlled by the Department of Energy. Theprovision included in Table 4 would allow the con-continuation of programmes on oil rig safety and continental Shelf surveying. They allow no signifi-cant support to industrial innovation in the field of offshore energy, and no domestic programme on new energy sources or energy conservation.17
16. It follows that a reduction in these figures would mean the cancellation or postponement ofsome programmes on oil rig safety. In fact,additional expenditure of  1-0 million in 1975-76, 6-0 million in 1976-77,  6-7 million in each ofthe years 1977-78 and 1978-79 and  8-1 million in 1979-80 would be required to enable the Depart-ment to carry out a modest domestic energyprogramme including R &amp; D on new energy sources(including wave power and tidal power), energyconservation (including combined heat and powerschemes), and to commission the further hydro-graphic survey necessary to assist in the formulation of licensing policy and to cover the UK&apos;s contribu-tions to certain R&amp;D programmes carried out underthe auspices of the International Energy Agency.It would also enable the Department to give alimited stimulation to industrial innovation in off-shore techniques (primarily those that will be needed in deep water in a few years&apos; time). If this latter is not funded now, British industry will be badlyplaced to compete offshore in the early 1980s.Policy option17. Expenditure on the Department of Industry&apos;smanagement budget as a whole is expected to rise from  30-4 million in 1975-76 to  41-8 million in 1979-80, an increase of 37 per cent during the survey period. The Treasury consider that afeasible policy option would be to reduce overallexpenditure on this management budget by  2 mil-lion in 1977-78,  4 million in 1978-79 and  5 million in 1979-80. This would still allowexpenditure to expand at a rate of 5 per cent ayear. Some of the additional expenditure stillallowed for would be required to meet non-recurringexpenditure towards the end of the Survey periodsuch as the dispersal of the Laboratory of theGovernment chemist. As this is a managementbudget, it would be for the Department to determinehow this reduction in the rate of expansion would be accomplished.18. The Department does not agree that savingsshould be found from this management budget. it considers that the level of forecasts, which are thesame as the 1974 Survey, must be maintained ifindustrial innovations is to play a full part in the revival of industry, if the research establishmentsare to continue to operate efficiently, and if theRequirements Boards are to be effective inreorienting and generating industrial research anddevelopment and in encouraging its application.Technological and industrial sponsorship19. This sub-programme is controlled as a management budget. The forecasts include provi-sion for Mineral Exploration Grants and DeepSea Mining. Provision is also included for thepayment to the National Research and development corporation of interest relief grant in respect of amicroelectronics project carried out under Section11 of the Development of Inventions Act 1967.Any United Kingdom contribution to the inter-national tin stockpile will be a charge to this budget.Aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance20. It is the Governments intention to nationalisethe aircraft industry. The Bill now before theHouse will not however go forward in the present session: it is planned instead to reintroduce itat the earliest possible opportunity in the next session. In these circumstances, and given thedifficulty of estimating the possible future invest-ment requirements of the Corporation in advanceof a corporate strategy, the figures in Table 4 take no account of the nationalisation proposals.21. No provision has been made for unapprovedaircraft or aero-engine projects. The projects that have been included have in the main been thesubject of recent Ministerial statements, and there-fore alternative policies have not been considered in those cases.Aircraft and aero-engine general research anddevelopment programme22. This programme covers support for research and experimental development aimed at improving the international competitiveness of the UnitedKingdom airframe, aero-engine and equipmentindustries. It includes expenditure on work carriedout in industry, universities and Ministry of Defence(Procurement Executive) research and development establishments. Last year the level of expenditureon the programme was reviewed, and the estimatesreflect the reduction in expenditure over the period1974-75 to 1977-78 that was then agreed. Theestimate for 1976-77 reflects a further reductionof  0-2 million as a contribution to the savingsannounced in the Budget. A significant acceleration-tion of the run down of this expenditure would face practical difficulties in terms of, for example,staffing in the MOD(PE) establishments, and wouldrisk jeopardising the viability of the programmenow being carried out.
Concorde23. The estimates are based on the development work necessary to achieve a certificate of air-worthiness by the end of 1975, and on the authorised production programme of 16 aircraft.No provision has been made for possible receiptsarising from the sale of aircraft to Iranair. Thepolicy to complete 16 aircraft was agreed by thePrime Minister and the French President last year.RB21124. Since 1971 the Government has been com-mitted to finance the development of the RB211-22,and the production of the first 555 engines for the lockheed Tristar. This part of the RB211programme has now reached the stage wherereceipts are exceeding expenditure. The Govern-ment announced in September 1974 that it had agreed to support the development of the more powerful RB211-524 for the Tristar, and on 20June 1975 the Secretary of State for Industryannounced Government support for the applicationof the engine to the Boeing 747 and agreement inprinciple to support a programme for thrustdevelopment to 53,000 lbs. As a result of thedecisions this year, expenditure is increased by 9-6 million over the Survey period, but othervariations since Cmnd. 5879, particularly a higherestimate of receipts of levy on the various versionsof the 524, partially offset the increase.Other aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance25. The main item is the provision of working capital for Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.- 20 million in1974-75, and  63 million in 1975-76 in cash terms.In April 1975 conditional approval was given by ministers to the company&apos;s 1975 budget, and the cash requirement is reflected in the amounts quoted above. Except for a small margin of expenditure which is being reviewed the budget is limited tothe company&apos;s firm commitments. It is intended that any financial support in subsequent years willbe provided through the National Enterprise Board see paragraph 37 below. Pending a review ofthe company&apos;s forward strategy, which is in prepara-tion, no provision has been made for repayment of Government loans of  25 million in 1978-79and  6 million in 1979-80.26. The estimates provide for receipts of levyarising from earlier Government support for aircraft and aero-engine projects,  and for GovernmentSECRETsupport of the M45H engine and the HS146 aircraft.Expenditure of  1-9 million in 1975-76 on theM45H is contractually committed: and provisionof  0-8 million in each of the years 1975-76 and1976-77 on the HS146 reflects the Ministerialdecision announced by the Secretary of State for industry on 9 December 1974 to keep the optionopen following the termination of the work byHawker Siddeley Aviation Ltd. (HSA) under theircontract with the Government. No provision hasbeen made for possible termination payments underthe contract with HSA for that programme.National space technology programme27. Although expenditure on space research anddevelopment is now largely devoted to collaborativeprojects within the European Space Agency (underthe International Space Programme), there are alsocontinuing commitments to a small National space technology Programme to be carried out partly in industry in 1975-76, and partly in the form of research and development work at the RoyalAircraft Establishment which is to run throughoutthe Survey period. The purpose of this programme is to support the United Kingdom space industryin maintaining its competitive position. There isan increase since Cmnd. 5879 due mainly toslippage from earlier commitments.International space programme28. This programme provides the main part ofthe United Kingdom contribution to the european space Agency (ESA). The contribution covers the applications programmes of the Agency (i.e. aero-nautical, meteorological, telecommunications andmaritime satellites) as well as the Space Laboratoryand the Ariane Launcher technology, and also ashare of the Agency&apos;s overheads. The forecast also provides, in the later years, for a United kingdom contribution to new programmes. The balance ofthe contribution to the ESA covering its scienceprogramme is paid by the Science Research Council,and is included in the provision for the research councils (see Programme 10, paragraphs 43 to 45).Policy options29. The Treasury propose that the provision shouldbe:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-8018-8	21-6	19-3	14-4	14-719
These figures reflect the Departments existing commitments to the ESA and allow for a contribu-tion to expenditure on new programmes, as currentlyproposed by the ESA, on the basis of member states&apos; GNP. The Treasury consider that UnitedKingdom participation in new programmes on amore generous scale than this cannot be justified inpresent circumstances. The Department considersthat its proposals are the minimum that can be con-sidered realistic if the United Kingdom is to con-tinue to play a full part in the future work of theESA. It considers that the reduction proposed would require Ministers to take a different, and muchmore restrictive, attitude to United Kingdom par-ticipation in new proposals.Atomic Energy Authority research and develop-ment, etc.30. The main provision under this heading is forthe Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor which isbeing adopted for the United Kingdom&apos;s nextnuclear power station orders (the costs of which arelikely to escalate above those included in the fore-cast) and the Fast Reactor, which is currently seen as the main element in the longer-term nuclear power programme. Provision is also made for con-tinuing development work in support of the advance Gas Cooled Reactors at present under con-struction; for underlying and applied nuclearresearch; for plasma physics and fusion research;research on general reactor safety and on radio-active waste treatment and disposal. Expenditure onthe High Temperature Reactor, other than on theinternational (Dragon) project, has virtually ceased.31. The Cmnd. 5879 provision will be insufficient tosupport these programmes and additional sums of 9 million in 1976-77,  14-6 million in 1977-78 and 6-1 million in 1979-80 will be required beyond theprovision shown in the Table 4 (net increase of 28-6 million to 1978-79). There is no effectivescope for the Authority to show substantial savings on its smaller programmes although it may be ableto achieve a small saving perhaps  2 million to 2-5 million over the Survey period -by withdraw-ing in 1976 from the International High Tempera-ture Reactor (Dragon) Project. This, however, is dependent upon the outcome of a current review of high Temperature Reactor policy. Major savings to enable expenditure to be contained within theCmnd. 5879 totals shown in the tables could only beachieved by substantial cuts in the Fast Reactorwork programme. This would have major implications-tions for the sea and our nuclear industry. Thefuture of the Fast Reactor is being considered by ministers. As an illustration of the possibilities, adecision to defer the start of the construction ofCFR1 by, say, two years to the end of 1979, while maintaining a minimum credible effort by AEAitself, would give rise to savings of  4 million in1975-76 and  26 million over the period 1976-77 to1978-79. This may not in the event be the bestapproach to cutting back, but the revised forecastson this basis, and allowing for savings of say  0-8million in each of the years 1976-77 to 1978-79in the event of withdrawal from Dragon, would be 89 million in 1976-77,  81-9 million in 1977-78and  72-9 million in 1978-79. This would reducethe increase required to 1979-80 to  0-2 million.Atomic Energy Authority other expenditure32. From 1976-77 this relates entirely to the saleof uranium ore (mainly to the Electricity GeneratingBoards).Nuclear services of the Department of Energy33. Almost all of this programme represents sup-port for the international centrifuge project forenriching uranium and provision for additionalworking capital for British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.(BNFL) and The Radiochemical Centre Ltd. (TRC).The Cmnd. 5879 provision is  32 million (of which 7 million is required in 1975-76) below the forecastrequirement over the survey period. The money is needed for the external funding needs of BNFL andTRC.34. BNFL require additional funds of  5 million ineach of the years 1975-76 and 1976-77 and 15 million in 1977-78 for direct investment incentrifuge enrichment capacity and in plant for thereprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel for the HomeGenerating Boards. Enrichment and reprocessingservices are indispensable features of the nuclear fuelcycle business. The capacity for which funding isbeing sought represents an essential underpinning ofthe United Kingdom nuclear power programme.35. TRC is a wholly publicly-owned companyprofitably engaged in the manufacture and marketing of radioisotopes for medical and other purposes.The company plans to expand its activities in par-ticular to set up a second manufacturing facility in
South Wales and for this purpose requiresadditional funding of  2 million in 1975-76,  3 mil-lion in 1976-77 and  2 million in 1977-78 without which the planned expansion will not be possible.GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYNational Enterprise Board36. No decisions have yet been taken about the phasing of funds for the National Enterprise Board(not). The figures included are therefore arbitraryand provisional. For the purpose of the Surveyit has been assumed that the statutory provision of 1,000 million in cash terms will be spread over aperiod of five years, i.e. a period extending slightlybeyond the end of the Survey period, and that expenditure other than on British Leyland MotorCorporation (BLMC) and Rolls-Royce (1971)Limited will be spread evenly, in cash terms, over that period.37. Rolls-Royce is preparing a strategy review which should be available for consideration by ministers in the autumn; pending that review the arbitrary assumption has been made that the com-pany&apos;s working capital requirements in 1976-77 willbe somewhat lower than the provision in 1975-76(paragraph 25 above).38. For BLMC it has been assumed provisionallythat  250 million of the  500 million in cashterms which BLMC is expected to require by1978-79 will be provided by the not;  150 million of the remainder would be provided as selectiveassistance under the Industry Act and  100 million from commercial sources. No decisions have beentaken about support for BLMC after 1978-79 butfor the purpose of the Survey it has been assumed that  125 million (again in cash terms) will berequired in 1979-80 and that  50 million of thiswill come from the not,  50 million from selectiveassistance under the Industry Act and  25 million from commercial sources.39. The Department considers that expendituremay have to be phased earlier if the not is tocarry out its wider industrial role satisfactorily.They also consider that, until decisions are taken,not more than half the proposed Governmentinvestment in BLMC should be attributed to theNEB.SECRETSelective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakingsbritish leyland act40. Provision is made for expenditure of  260million in 1975-76 under this Act for the purchaseof existing shares ( 60 million) and the proposedequity rights issue ( 200 million).section 8 of the industry act 197241. The biggest item here is the non-not balance(see above) of Government assistance to the british leyland Motor Corporation; the provision is againarbitrary and provisional. It is assumed that  150million will be provided under the Industry Act1972 up to the review point in 1978-79, and,although no decision about support beyond 1978-79has yet been taken, a further  50 million has been assumed for 1979-80. Part of this assistance might in the event be provided under Section 7 of theIndustry Act rather than Section 8, but it has been assumed for purposes of these figures that all willbe under Section 8.42. Secondly, in his Budget speech the Chancellorannounced that an additional  100 million wouldbe made available for new industry support schemes and for special assistance to investment projectsstarted before the end of March 1976. provision is now made for these. It has been agreed thatthere should be three support schemes, for the machine tools, the ferrous foundries, and the clothing industries, with provisional expenditureallocations of  20 million,  25 million and  15million respectively.  40 million has provisionallybeen allocated to investment projects. No firmforecast of expenditure by years can yet be made.The spread shown in the table assumes that all but 5 million of the  100 million will be spent inthe Survey period.43. Part of the  40 million for investment projectsmay again be spent under Section 7 of the industry act rather than under Section 8, but the wholesum is being treated for the moment as falling underSection 8.44. The forecasts include expenditure on the WoolTextiles Scheme up to and including 1977-78, andin 1975-76 provision is included for assistance toAlfred Herbert Ltd. ( 25 million) and SynovaMotors Ltd. (the Meriden Motor Cycle Co-operative) ( 0-9 million).   New projects, and any21
expenditure resulting from the calling up of guarantees, will be additional to the presentprovision.45. Provision is also made for payments by theDepartment of Energy under the Offshore InterestRelief Grants Scheme. The annual forecast from1976-77 has been reduced in line with current take-up under the scheme. No provision has beenmade for other new Section 8 projects by theDepartment of Energy. But the Department hashitherto had a claim on the contingency reserve of 10 million a year for cases approved by Ministers.It has agreed to work to a ceiling of  7 million ayear.assistance to icl46. Provision is made for the outstanding balancedue to International Computers (Holdings) Ltd.under the current programme of support announced in 1972-73, which runs until 1976-77. repayment of this support will start to fall due in 1978-79;the forecasts are based on the terms of the agree-ment with the company and depend on profitsmaterialising at levels currently envisaged.Promotion of tourism47. The forecasts include provision for the grants-in-aid to the British Tourist Authority, and theEnglish, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards and for selective assistance for tourist projects in thedevelopment areas under Section 4 of the Develop-ment of Tourism Act 1969. Assistance for hoteldevelopment schemes under Part II of the Act has ceased and no provision is necessary beyond1975-76.Policy option48. The Treasury consider that it would be feasible to hold the grants-in-aid for the British TouristAuthority and the English, Scottish and the WalesTourist Boards constant at the 1975-76 level for thewhole of the Survey period. This would achieve a saving of  0-9 million in 1979-80, of which 0-5 million would come from the British TouristAuthority and the English Tourist Board. However,the Department of Trade, the Scottish Office andthe Welsh Office would resist this proposal on thegrounds that it is important both politically and forthe morale of the British Tourist Authority and the tourist Boards that we should be able to point tosome expansion of activity, however small, duringthe Survey period, especially since the British TouristAuthority and English Tourist Board grants-in-aidhave already made a substantial contribution to theDepartment of Trade&apos;s savings despite beingexcepted from the percentage cuts exercise.Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending49. The forecasts provide for the refinancing ofpart of the guaranteed credit made available by the banks at a preferential fixed rate of interest to united Kingdom purchasers of ships built in UnitedKingdom shipyards. This refinancing is worked inconjunction with similar arrangements for exportcredit refinancing; under the scheme ECGD and department of Industry finance on a pro rata basislending by the banks in excess of a proportion oftheir non-interest bearing sterling sight deposits (seeparagraph 62 below). Except for 1975-76, thefigures are considerably lower than in Cmnd. 5879.This reflects a lower forecast of ship lending bythe banks. Total net lending by the banks underthis scheme is expected to remain about level in cash terms over the Survey period: the fallingexpenditure reflects a forecast decline in the propor-tion of such lending refinanced by the Government.Assistance to the shipbuilding industry50. Because of the deferment of the Aircraft and shipbuilding Nationalisation Bill, complete figuresfor the capital expenditure programme of theindustry after nationalisation cannot yet be shown.51. The expenditure provided for here falls mainlyunder Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972. It covers,first, current commitments to Govan Shipbuilders,Cammell Laird, Sunderland Shipbuilders, Austin andPickersgill and certain smaller shipbuilders;secondly, a notional provision of  10 million a year for further capital assistance to the industry in later years; and thirdly, provision for additional loss-funding grants of  5 million a year starting in1976-77, mainly in respect of Govan Shipbuilders.52. There is also provision for residual expenditureon construction grants under Section 11 of theIndustry Act 1972.Other support services53. Provision is made for the remainder of the machine tool accelerated expenditure in 1975-76 andfor the repayment of loans in respect of the QE2,aluminium smelters and ex-Industrial reorganisation corporation (1958-59) commitments.   The forecasts
assume that the QE2 loan will continue tobe repaid at  10 million a year. The repayments of the aluminium smelter loans are now forecast athigher levels than previously due to rephasing. It is assumed that 1958-59 loans will be recovered in fulland that share holdings will be retained indefinitelyunless reorganisations involve a change in or dis-posal of these holdings. Provision is made foradvances of  0-3 million to the National FilmFinance Corporation in 1975-76, being the balanceof the sum of  1-0 million currently being madeavailable to the Corporation.54. Department of Energy expenditure under this heading is on the Energy Savings Loan Scheme and construction sites for offshore oil production plat-forms. The annual provision for the loan scheme has been reduced to  2 million for 1976-77 and1977-78 in line with present take-up levels. Atpresent the Department is committed to assisting the construction of only one oil platform site underthe Offshore Petroleum Development (Scotland) Act1975; no provision is made for any further cases which may arise. The Department considers that anadditional provision of  0-5 million a year shouldbe made in 1975-76, 1976-77 and 1977-78 forsurveying tow-out routes since it would be disastrousif a rig failed to reach its site because the route hadnot been surveyed. Part or all of the costs would be recovered.Investment grants55. The expenditure is for outstanding commit-ments under this scheme.SUPPORT FOR NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES(other than the transport industries)Assistance to the coal industry56. The forecast assumes that there will be nofurther operational grants to the National coal board and that payments will be confined to socialgrants, redundant mineworkers payment scheme,pensions, etc. Ministers have yet to decide whetherthey wish to give the industry further assistance ofthis nature after the provisions of the 1973 CoalIndustry Act expire in March 1976. Any expendi-ture arising out of such a decision would constitute a claim on the contingency reserve. A further claim on the reserve would arise if it became necessaryto implement the Governments commitment toassist the industry in the event of adverse fluctuations in oil prices.SECRETCompensation for price restraint57. Subsidies for price compensation in 1975-76are equivalent at outturn prices to  100 million,made up of  30 million for the electricity industry inEngland and Wales and  70 million for the PostOffice. It is assumed that no subsidies will be paidin later years.Other compensation58.  28-8 million is included for compensation tothe gas and electricity industries for the additionalinterest payments incurred as a result of bringing forward investment in 1971-72 and 1972-73 at theGovernment^ request. Provision is also made forthe scheme, introduced in 1974, for re-adaptationgrants to redundant steel workers. The substantial reductions in the present forecasts in comparisonwith Cmnd. 5879 figures for this scheme areattributable to the rephasing of the British steel corporation^ closure programme following the SteelClosure Review.Other services59. This programme includes the operation andmaintenance by the Department of Energy ofGovernment installations for storing oil for civil purposes. Additional expenditure of at least 0-1 million a year from 1977-78 will be required if the Department is to fulfil present government policy, which is currently being reviewed.INTERNATIONAL TRADEExport promotion60. The forecasts include provision for net expendi-ture on trade fairs, missions, etc; the British ExportMarketing Centre, Tokyo; industrial trainingschemes; technical help to exporters; the overseasprojects fund; assistance to overseas marketingresearch; education and training for overseas trade;and grants-in-aid and selective grants to non-officialtrade organisations.Trade co-operation61. The provision covers the United kingdom share of the expenses of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade, the subscription to the Inter-national Customs Tariffs Bureau and the UnitedKingdom share of the expenses incurred by the secretariat of COST (European Co-operation in theField of Scientific and Technological Research) andcertain research studies.23
Refinancing of fixed rate export credits62. The United Kingdom, like most of the mainindustrial countries, offers medium and long-termcredit at a fixed rate of interest on exports of majorcapital goods. The scheme also covers home ship-building. This expenditure is the Export credits guarantee Departments (ECGD) share of the costof refinancing that part of the fixed rate creditextended by the clearing banks for exports and homeshipbuilding which exceeds 18 per cent of their non-interest bearing sterling sight deposits; the share attributable to home shipbuilding is met by theDepartment of Industry and shown separately (para-graph 49 above). The expenditure recordedrepresents the net addition to refinancing in the rele-vant year, except that the figures for the years up to1975-76 are abnormally higher because they include provision for transferring to ECGD the amount ofthe refinancing provided prior to 1972 by the IssueDepartment of the Bank of England (which did not count as public expenditure). This is a demand-determined service and the current estimates of ex-penditure on refinancing are substantially higher thanthose in Cmnd. 5879 because they are based onrevised forecasts of fixed rate lending by the banksand the level of their non-interest bearing sterlingsight deposits.Policy options63. As the fixed rates set by the Government arebelow current market rates there is also a substantialinterest rate subsidy which does not however countas public expenditure. The net cost of this subsidy,which mainly takes the form of interest forgone onsums refinanced, is expected to be about  130 million in 1975-76. In order to reduce the interest ratesubsidy, the Treasury have proposed that con-sideration should now be given to an increase of\ per cent in the minimum fixed rates (to 1\ per cent for credit of two to five years and 8 per cent for credit of over five years, but excluding ships). Thisproposal would take time to have its full effect onthe interest rate subsidy, which will depend on thefuture level of United Kingdom capital goodsexports and hence the level of fixed rate lending,and on the gap between the fixed and the marketrate. But by 1979-80 the saving might amount toabout  10 million a year.64. The most direct way of reducing public expenditure would be to increase the amount offinance which the clearing banks are required toprovide themselves. An increase in the refinancingthreshold of 1 per cent of non-interest bearingsterling sight deposits would reduce expenditure by 75 million in the first year and about  10 million ineach succeeding year. The banks would not agree toan increase however unless they were given a rate of return which would make the finance they providednoticeably more expensive than borrowing by theGovernment to provide refinance. Attempts to findan acceptable way of reducing public expenditure by admitting other banks to the scheme have failed.65. Proposals are also being considered, partly in a balance of payments context, for facilitating the financing of export credit in foreign currencies.The implications for public expenditure are un-certain but might avoid or defer some of therefinancing which would otherwise have been required.Cost escalation scheme66. The Export Credits Guarantee Department was empowered by the Export Guarantees amendment act 1975 to provide insurance against certain increases in the cost of manufacturing capital goods for export or performing major projects overseas.This expenditure represents the extent to whichpayments to exporters under guarantees, and admini-stration costs, are expected to exceed the income from premiums. Until 1977-78 premium income isexpected to exceed payments; from 1978-79 the opposite is expected. The forecasts of income andexpenditure are based upon present estimates of therate of inflation, the demand from exporters for thescheme, and the extent to which they are successful in obtaining contracts. All these factors are subjectto a great degree of uncertainty.REGULATION OF DOMESTIC TRADE ANDINDUSTRY AND CONSUMER PROTEC-TIONProtection of innovation67. This provision includes Patent Office salaries,general administrative expenses and receipts, sub-prescriptions to the International Patents Institute atThe Hague and to the International Bureaux atGeneva and expenditure in connection with theEuropean Patent Office. The provision allows for substantial increases in fees due to become opera-tive in 1975-76, and which are assumed to bring in about  3 million extra a year.
Regulation   of  trading  practices  and  consumerprotection68. The provision includes the Department ofTrade&apos;s expenditure on salaries and generaladministrative expenses, together with associatedreceipts, in connection with Insurance, companies and Insolvency Divisions. The forecast assumesstaff savings dependent on the passage of theInsolvency Services Bill. The provision for receiptsallows for a substantial increase in renewal fees.Additional receipts are included, dependent on thepassage of the Companies Bill, of  0-5 million ayear from 1977-78.69. The provision covers the Department of prices and Consumer Protection^ expenditure on the monopolies and Mergers Commission, support forthe National Council of Social Service and expendi-ture on the promotion of the activities of localadvisory centres. In addition, the cost is nowincluded of the National Consumers&apos; Council, sixnationalised industry consumer councils, a grant-in-aid to the Royal Society for the Prevention of accidents (transferred from the Home Office) andexpenditure on research on the safety of consumer goods (from the Home Office and the Departmentof Industry). The programme also provides forthe continuance and development of the statutoryfunctions of the Office of Fair Trading with respectto monopolies and mergers, restrictive trade prac-tices, consumer protection and consumer credit.Expenditure occurring in the administration of theConsumer Credit Act will be met from fees.Provision is made for a Government loan to TheAir Travel Reserve Fund, set up under the AirTravel Reserve Fund Act 1975, and for its repay-ment.Standards and quality assurance70. The main item of expenditure is the grant-in-aid for the British Standards Institution. provision is also made for expenditure on the MetricationBoard and quality assurance schemes and forsubscriptions to the International Bureau of weights and Measures and the International organisation for Legal Metrology. It is now assumed that themain metric changes affecting the consumer willtake place between 1975 and 1977 (later than earlierforecast) and provision for the continued work onthe Board has been made accordingly; this accounts for the increase in the forecasts in 1976-77.   TheSECRETproposals assume that approval will be given forplanned increases in fees for Weights and Measuresservices.FUNCTIONING OF THE LABOUR MARKET71. This programme aims to improve the func-tioning of the labour market by developing theemployment, training and other labour marketservices provided through the Department ofEmployment. It includes expenditure by theDepartment of the Environment on job centres,skill centres and employment rehabilitation centres,which with other related expenditure on servicesformerly provided on an allied service basis willbe transferred to this programme. expenditure by local authorities on the Careers Service is also included.72. The Manpower Services Commission (MSC)and its two agencies, the Training Services Agency(TSA) and the Employment Service Agency (ESA)are now fully operational. The Commission isfinanced by grant-in-aid and most of its expendi-ture and that of the Agencies is included in theprovision for this programme.73. Certain of the Departments schemes for train-ing, employment transfer, rehabilitation of thehandicapped and career development of young people are eligible for assistance from the EuropeanSocial Fund. Such receipts are taken into account in the net contribution to the e.c., etc. (see table 2).Manpower Services Commission74. The Commission is directly responsible forcarrying out its functions within a general policyframework agreed with the Secretary of State.Plans have been made to allocate the additional resources ( 20 million in 1975-76 and  30 million in 1976-77) announced in the Budget statement.Employment services and employment rehabilitation75. The main expenditure is on the placing serviceof the ESA. Some 70 job centres have now been opened and the scale of their activities continues torise significantly. It is planned to open a further150 job centres in 1975-76 by accelerating for thatyear the long-term programme intended to provideabout 400 such centres at the rate of 100 a yearby the end of the decade. It had been hoped to develop this rate to 125 a year but this will25
not be possible within the constraints of thisSurvey. Provision for PSA services has not yetbeen transferred to this programme.76. Responsibility for the Careers Service has nowpassed to local authorities in England, Wales and scotland. Whilst the Service will be subject tothe general limitations to be applied to localauthority expenditure sufficient provision is madeto enable the Service to deal with demographicgrowth but not to expand its activities significantlyin the Further Education sector under the powersprovided in the Employment and Training Act.77. Provision has been made in 1975-76 and1976-77 to develop and improve the EmploymentTransfer Scheme as a means of assisting labourmobility in those years but no provision has yetbeen made for maintaining this level of assistancebeyond 1976-77.Industrial training78. Additional provision has been made in1975-76 and 1976-77 to assist apprentice andother training in a variety of ways and to increasesignificantly the volume of direct training in aperiod of higher unemployment. This provision was made on the basis that most of it can be curtailed as the position improves but the substan-tial increase in training allowances is not yetreflected in the provision for 1977-78 and onwards.Some provision remains to be transferred fromPSA for services previously provided on an alliedservice basis.Redundancy Fund payments79. The numbers receiving payments in 1974-75(210,000) were below the assessment reflected in cmnd. 5879 but were closer to the general level than in 1971-72 and 1973-74. The Fund has beenin surplus since August 1973, despite the increaselast year in the earnings limit. Provision has beenmade to meet modest additional expenditure arisingfrom provisions in the Employment Protection Billto safeguard employees&apos; redundancy payments incases of the insolvency of the employer.Industrial relations and other labour market services80. This relates in part to the cost of Departmentof Employment staff engaged on general manpowerpolicy, economic policy (manpower), incomes andindustrial relations work. Also included areindustrial  tribunals,  the  Office  of  ManpowerEconomics, and the new institutions to be estab-lished by the Employment Protection Bill. TheAdvisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service hasbeen separated from the Department of Employ-ment and will become fully independent following the passage of this Bill. Current public expenditurerestrictions will impose some constraint on theexpansion of the Service in 1976-77.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICESEmployment81. This part of the programme covers Departmentof Employment expenditure on services for theseriously disabled, the Health and Safety Commis-sion, international relations work (mainly the sub-scription to the International Labour Organisation)together with the central and common services notattributable to other employment programmes.82. The provision of services for the seriously dis-abled consists mainly of grants towards the cost ofRemploy Limited, local authorities and other bodiesproviding training and employment under shelteredconditions. A decision regarding the future organisa-tion of sheltered employment is to be taken shortly.The combined effect of the cuts in capital and current grants will be to reduce the modest rate of increase envisaged in Cmnd. 5879 (about 350 newjobs a year on a current total of about 14,000) to250 in 1976-77 and to 150 by 1979-80. voluntary bodies are in financial difficulties because of inflation-tion; this will cause a loss of places either directlyin their specialised fields or indirectly in generalworkshops from which resources may have to be diverted to safeguard the specialised places.83. The Health and Safety Commission came into existence in October 1974 and the Health and SafetyExecutive on as recently as 1st January 1975. the health and Safety at Work etc. Act requires theCommission to rationalise the structure of thevarious constituent inspectorates and to extend theprotection of the Act to some 8 million employeesnot previously covered. Ministers are also com-mitted to a considerable increase in the staffing ofthe Factory Inspectorate. In order to fulfil its func-tions under the Health and Safety at Work etc. act the Commission needs considerable additional resources, but it was not possible to estimate theextent of such resources until recently. the cuts required by this Survey and the restrictions
on any further expenditure beyond the level of cmnd. 5879 will have the effect of halting these developments and thereby preventing the Commis-sion from meeting all its responsibilities under theAct for some time. Expenditure by the PSA on) premises, together with most of the other relatedexpenditure on services formerly provided on an allied service basis, has not yet been transferred tothis programme.Other84. This sub-programme covers salaries andadministrative and miscellaneous expenses of theDepartments of Industry, Trade (except those of thePatent Office and Insurance, Companies andInsolvency Divisions which are carried on relevantsub-programmes), Prices and Consumer protection and Energy, as well as those of the Price Commis-sion up to 31st March 1976, when existing legislationexpires. There is provision for an additional 0-4 million in 1976-77 and  0-8 million thereafterfor extra staff for the Department of Industry todeal with Planning Agreements. Provision for theDepartment of Energy will not be sufficient to meetthe increasing pressures resulting from the develop-ment of Government policies in the energy field; anadditional  0-5 million in 1976-77 and  0-6 million a year thereafter would be required to provide forthe Departments bid for extra staff mainly for workon North Sea Oil. Provision includes a contribution of  0-2 million a year to the International EnergyAgency and small payments to the Government ofthe Isle of Man as their percentage of the oil and gasroyalties from the Continental Shelf.85. Provision is made for the first time for theBritish National Oil Corporation (BNOC). Thefigures of  100 million in 1975-76 and  500 million in 1976-77 included in Table 4 are estimates only and could be subject to significant changes, depend-ing particularly on the speed and extent of progress on participation. Within these estimates provision is definitely needed for expenditure by NCB(Exploration) which is to be taken over by BNOCand which is estimated at  54 million in 1975-76and  60 million in 1976-77. Information on which to base estimates for later years in the survey period is not available and provision for those years will need to be a charge against the contingency reserve.SECRET27

The figures in Cmnd. 5879 for the trunk road and motorway construction programme ran from 317 million in 1975-76 to  338 million in 1978-79.This was already a severe reduction compared withthe expenditure forecast in Cmnd. 5178. The recentfurther cut in expenditure in 1976-77 has led toreduced expenditure in that year of  297 million,which represents a total reduction of some 45 percent against the 1972 forecast. The reductions nowproposed for the later years have the effect of changing the programme from a slowly growingprogramme to a declining programme (some 7-8 percent between 1975-76 and 1978-79).
2. Roads now carry 90 per cent of passenger milesand 85 per cent of all inland freight ton miles. the proportions are expected to grow. Forecasts suggestthat road traffic will rise by over 60 per cent in thenext 15 years despite increased fuel costs. But the succession of cuts has meant that the national road programme is lagging behind the rising demand for transport infrastructure. New additions or improve-ments to the inter-urban network give good value for money in terms of economic benefits. They also provide environmental benefits by taking traffic outof towns and villages. Planning blight whichaccompanies all major road schemes will last longerand there may be difficulty in finding sufficient fundsquickly to complete different sections of major newroutes. This will delay the benefits and aggravatecongestion in the area of the incomplete road.3. The 3,100-mile network of high quality roadsthat would, on earlier programmes, have been com-pleted very early in the 1980s will now only becompleted in the mid-1980s. Some schemes planned for later years may have to be abandoned. the limited resources will be concentrated on schemeswith a high economic return or with substantialenvironmental benefits (e.g. by-passes to historictowns).scotland. The provision for schemes direcdy related to theinfrastructure of offshore oil is based on the currentestimates of the actual cost of these works, and hasbeen excepted from the formula cuts. The newyear (1979-80) shows the beginning of the downturnfor this expenditure but it will probably be necessaryto rephase expenditure on the A9 as a result of therecent tenders received for the Kessock Bridge.5. Otherwise the effect of the formula cuts will cause considerable delay to the whole programme.Committed expenditure absorbs a very high pro-portion of the provision and works on the shelf nowamount to over  30 million. The completion of theCentral Scotland Motorway, improvement of other major roads, replacement of bridges and importantenvironmental improvements have already been delayed and will continue to be held up.wales6. A programme reduced as shown in the Tablewould mean that progress could not be made as planned with the M4 motorway, the only motorwayin Wales, and that nearly all other major roadprojects would be subject to serious delays.SECRETMaintenance7. The expenditure figures proposed for trunk roadsimply a considerable reduction in maintenancestandards, especially given increases in motorwaymileage and in axle loading. The effects willprobably first show in the appearance and ridingquality of roads and in footway maintenance.Although the reductions will be concentrated in areas where safety should not be much affected, there willbe some additional risks.LOCAL TRANSPORTGeneralengland and wales8. Local authority spending on transport is nowscrutinised through annual Transport Policies and programmes (TPPs) submitted by authorities tocover a five-year rolling programme. Once an allocation of grant for the first of the five years has been decided, priorities are a matter for the localauthorities so that the divisions of expenditure shownin the Table are indicative only, though expenditurein the early years is largely committed. The savingswill be secured only through the co-operation oflocal authorities, although the allocation of grant will clearly have an effect, as will policy statements from central Government.9. The proposed reductions would cut total local expenditure on transport by 19 per cent between1975-76 and 1979-80. Reductions of this magnitudemight mean that local authorities, perhaps tomaintain the level of their directly employed staff,will cut back mainly on capital expenditure to a degree which might be unacceptable to CentralGovernment: if so, the Government might wish toconsider altering the system of TPPs and grant to restore a greater degree of detailed control.scotland10. Following the reorganisation of local govem-ment in Scotland, promising discussions have been taking place with the new regional/islands councilsabout the preparation of their first TransportPolicies and Programmes which are due to besubmitted to the Secretary of State later this year.11. With minor exceptions specific grants havebeen terminated and support for local transport isnow channelled directly through Rate support grant. This transition is unfortunately coincidingwith a period of severe financial difficulty for bus33
operators, in rural areas in particular. The fore-cast of expenditure for passenger transport supportwill be under severe pressure in this year&apos;s negotiations. The eventual pattern of expenditure within the programme may differ from thatillustrated because of adjustments reflecting localauthorities&apos; individual priorities. The guidelinesissued to authorities on the basis of Cmnd. 5879indicating possible levels of expenditure in future years will have to be revised downwards to reflect the reductions proposed in 1977-78 and 1978-79.LOCAL   TRANSPORT:   CAPITAL   INVEST-MENTRoads: New construction and improvementengland and wales12. This heading relates to all roads (includinglighting) over which local authorities have control,including certain roads in new towns.13. Reductions in capital expenditure on the scaleenvisaged would require a reduction in new startson road schemes in 1976-77 compared with thoseenvisaged for 1975-76 in the Transport Supple-mentary Grant (TSG) allocations. Thereafter newstarts would need to run at a reduced level through-out the Survey period. It would be necessary tomonitor new starts in any year carefully if expendi-ture limits in subsequent years were not to be exceeded, and this might require some amendment tothe TSG system.scotland14. The Scottish Office consider that the provisionincluded here for essential work in support of north Sea Oil development, which is as in Cmnd.5879, is inadequate. It is more than usuallydifficult to predict how the oil-related programme will be phased; but the Scottish Office view is thatfunds will be needed as in the following table:  million at 1975 Survey prices	1975	1976	1977	1978	1979	-76	-77	-78	-79	-80Scottish Office	5-0	7-1	6-8	5-0	5-0Treasury	3-8	3-5	2-8	1-3	1-515. If this expenditure has to be met from thecurrent forecasts, non-oil-related expenditure wouldhave to be cut by much more than the formulacuts-over 30 per cent in 1978-79:   This wouldresult in severe delays to many firmly committedschemes and could result in some roads, requiredfor new housing and industry and in comprehensivedevelopment areas and New Towns, being severelydelayed in the rest of the decade. The MonklandMotorway in Glasgow which is one of the final stages of the Central Scotland Motorway might well have to be further rephased.Public transport investmentengland and wales16. Formula reductions would reduce investment in new buses. This would be incompatible withencouraging public transport. Provision for businvestment has been shielded at the expense of savings elsewhere. The provision for investment in rail and underground infrastructure is almostentirely for schemes already under construction and could not, after reductions, accommodate any major new schemes, e.g. the Manchester Pice-Vic project.scotland17. Minor rephasing of two major schemes in glasgow may prove necessary; these are the modernisation of the Underground and Clyderailschemes.LOCAL TRANSPORT: CURRENT EXPENDI-TURERoads maintenance18. The economic effect and practical consequences of lower standards cannot be estimated: there isa risk that reduced standards will lead to structuralfailures resulting in higher costs in subsequent years. Local authority highways vary from busyprincipal roads to country lanes, and authorities will be advised to seek economies as far as possible on roads where the traffic is comparatively light and speeds are not high. The public will haveto be told of the reduced standards and the reasonsfor them. Moreover, the savings implied by theformula are substantial and in an area where direct labour is a major ingredient there can be no assurance that even they can be achieved in total.Despite this, the need to sustain other areas oftransport spending, e.g. on road construction andpublic transport, has been felt to justify a greatercut in maintenance expenditure than the formulawould require.
Car parks19. The policy is to achieve economic charges forcar-parking. Current costs of car-parking should be covered by receipts from charges, and the capital costs of new provision should also be recovered fromreceipts over a reasonable period of time. However,local authorities&apos; charges are not within direct con-trol, and there can be no guarantee of growth in income as rapid as the forecasts in Table 6 envisage,particularly so long as parking charges are con-strained by price control. Any shortfall would need to be offset by reductions elsewhere in local transportexpenditure.Other expenditure20. This includes administration and expenditureon road safety education, training and publicity.Formula reductions in expenditure on administra-tion will inevitably be difficult to achieve.British Rail subsidies21. The proposed expenditure line makes no provision for growth in the number, or improve-ments in the standards, of services supported byPassenger Transport Executives (PTEs) underSection 20 of the 1968 Transport Act, although there is considerable pressure from PTEs for suchimprovements. Some schemes are already under construction by British Rail which will add tosupport costs during the 1980s (see also para-graph 31).Bus and underground revenue subsidiesengland and wales22. Cmnd. 5879 envisaged a 50 per cent reductionin support for buses and underground between1975-76 and 1978-79. The additional reductionproposed for this Survey would increase this to61 per cent. The reduction follows the very rapid increase in subsidy which occurred during 1974,when fares were in many cases held down whilecosts rose sharply.23. Existing Government policies already entailfares being raised much more rapidly than costs,particularly in metropolitan counties, in order to recover some of the ground lost in 1974; and theGovernments powers to influence local farespolicies are limited. There is also a limit to the pace at which fares can be raised without causingsuch a reduction in passengers carried that the gain in net revenue is totally inadequate. The initialreductions in passengers carried following fareSECRETincreases earlier this year suggests that the limitmay be lower than expected. If so there is a riskof bus service cuts which would leave areas of thecountry without public transport (with the risk of substantial redundancy, notably within the NationalBus Company), and a minimum amount of subsidywill probably be required indefinitely to maintain an acceptable level of bus service in such areas.24. It will be some months before the evidenceof fares policy in 1975-76 is available. But theDOE consider that it seems likely to show thatthe reductions in subsidy now proposed in subse-quent years could not be achieved withoutsubstantial service cuts throughout the countryincluding the metropolitan areas.scotland25. In general bus fares in Scotland are higher andso the general bus subsidy paid up to now has beensmaller relative to costs. This is having two effects.Firstly, there is clear evidence that recent fareincreases are, temporarily at least, producing un-precedented diminishing returns in many busoperations. While this is particularly noticeable in rural services (where subsidy could increase three orfour-fold in 1975-76) urban and inter-urban services are beginning to experience it too, and the trendcould well be permanent. Authorities seem likely tobe faced with a choice between drastic closures andmassive increases of subsidy; so local authorities may well not be prepared to keep subsidies down tothe reduced levels, even though the provision stillshows a significant increase over the Survey period.The second effect is on expenditure on concessionaryfares (see paragraph 29 below).Concessionary faresengland26. Responsibility for inclusion of this item hasrecently been transferred from the Secretary of Statefor the Social Services to the Secretary of State forthe Environment.27. The operation of the schemes is within the dis-cretion of local authorities and expenditure has been rising rapidly in real terms in recent years. CurrentCentral Government policy is that there should beno expansion of existing concessionary fare schemesor introduction of new ones. There is a wide dis-parity between the concessions offered by differentauthorities and a consequent pressure towardslevelling up.35
28. The expenditure forecasts, which repeat Cmnd.5879, are based on very inadequate data. They showa small growth but this could easily be exceeded by changes in the level of take-up of existing schemes.scotland29. As indicated above, high bus fare levels inScotland are reflected in large and rapidly increasingexpenditure on concessionary fare schemes. Theprovision has been increased from the Cmnd. 5879level of  4 million a year to  10 million a year, butthere could be difficulty in containing expenditureeven within that level.CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIESNationalised industries30. The largest item in this block represents support to the British Railways Board (BRB). The levels of subsidy which will be required are currently being reviewed by Ministers. Provision is therefore basedon that in Cmnd. 5879 and changed to reflect theeffect of the capital reconstruction under the Rail-ways Act 1974, changes in accounting rules (mainly the charging of infrastructure assets to revenueinstead of capital account) and the separation ofBRB&apos;s historic pensions liabilities from the rest oftheir finances. Total subsidies, including indicativesums for payments by the PTEs, which are includedin local transport above, are:  million at 1975 Survey prices						1975	1976	1977	1978	1979	-76	-77	-78	-79	-80Direct support by Central					Government	297	322	338	360	360Payments by PTEs:					Scotland	12	12	12	12	12Others	17	18	19	19	19	326	352	369	391	391Support for pensions					liabilities	65	67	60	51	60O	391	419	429	442	451(&apos;) The treatment of repayments of notional capital debt as public expenditure has not been agreed by the Department.31. The allocation of subsidy figures between central and local government is provisional. Follow-ing the Railways Act 1974, the Government and thePTEs are reviewing the basis on which PTE pay-ments should be made, and when the effects of these have been assessed, an adjustment of the subsidyprovision between central and local government maybe required.32. The subsidy provision also makes no allow-ance for grants which will be required to meet BRB&apos;sdeficit on the non-passenger sector of the railwaysbusiness. Transitional grants will be requiredpending the elimination of the deficit and theresources will need to be found from the contingency reserve; initial estimates are that subsidy in 1975-76will be some  55 million partially offset by a reduc-tion of  30 million in passenger grants; later years will depend on the review mentioned in paragraph 30above.33. Two other industries are expected to requiresupport in 1975-76 and subsequently:(a) The British Waterways Board (BWB) receivesgrants for essential maintenance of the water-ways and the improvement to modem trafficstandards of about 400 bridges carryingpublic roads over the waterways. The pro-vision is increased for 1975-76 over Cmnd.5879, partly because of rapidly rising labour costs and partly because of the need to expand the maintenance programme for safetyreasons. (This increase is offset by reductionselsewhere.) A major review of the BWB isin progress and the report is expected shortly.Meanwhile the provision for 1976-77 onwardshas been unaltered.(b) The Scottish Transport Group (STG). Thegrant to the Group&apos;s subsidiary DavidMacBrayne Ltd., continues, although onemajor loss-making service will probably closethis year. Provision is made for subsidy of 2-5 million in 1975-76 and 1976-77 to theother shipping subsidiary, CaledonianMacBrayne Ltd., to meet operating deficitswhich could only otherwise be covered byunacceptably high increases in fares whichmight in any case not bring in the necessaryrevenue. The figures included in Table 6 forCaledonian MacBrayne are those of theTreasury; the Scottish Office take the viewthat it is unreasonable that they should beexpected to find full offsetting cuts in the later years of the Survey for a project recognised as a special case in 1976-77. They have pro-vided  2-5 million in 1975-76 and  0-7 mil-lion a year from 1977-78 by reducing other
parts of their programmes but are seekingthat the balance of  1-8 million required from 1977-78 onwards should be added totheir allocation.Other34. The main item is the refund of fuel duty to bperators of bus stage services for about1,500 million miles of stage carriage service run eachyear. Increases in duty have been refunded to suchoperators since 1964 and full remission of duty,amounting to 22 p per gallon, has been allowedsince 12th February 1974 because of the immediately preceding sharp increase in motor fuel prices.35. In addition 50 per cent grants are made towardsthe cost of buying new buses for use on stage ser-vices. Total investment in new buses by public sector bodies appears as part of their capital pro-grammes, and only the grants to the private sectorare shown here. Following the Cabinet remit to officials to reconsider the future of new bus grantsa report will be made to Ministers in time for their decisions on this PESC Report.36. The Railways Act 1974 empowered theSecretary of State to make grants towards the pro-vision of facilities for the loading or unloading of railfreight. Table 6 includes only the payment of grant to the private sector. Grant aided expenditure by public sector bodies will form part of their capital programmes.37. Other subsidies include those under the High-lands and Islands Shipping Services Act 1960 forsea transport services in Orkney and Shetland.PORTS AND SHIPPINGPorts38. The provision covers investment by theindependent harbour trusts and local authorityowned harbours, and grants and loans to ports inthe private sector. Provision for the new port atSullom Voe, to be provided by Shetland IslandsCouncil, to deal with North Sea oil, has been slightlyreduced since Cmnd. 5879.39. The reduced level of provision for Scotlandmeans that further development of roll-on /rcll-offfacilities will be minimal, and it will not bepossible to proceed with any major new scheme. ASECRETfurther development at Peterhead Bay Harbour a tanker jetty for the new power station nearby and forthe possible export of liquefied gases is not yetfully provided for in the programme. various methods of solving this problem are being con-sidered.40. It is not possible to give firm estimates of the timing and cost of the Governments proposals for public ownership of ports and port businesses. It isnot yet certain when the necessary legislation will beintroduced and the cost could be up to  150 million or more depending on exemptions and the terms ofcompensation.41. Acquisition of private commercial ports might cost some  60 million and of port businesses some 90 million spread over say three years. In addition the whole capital investment programmes of these ports and port businesses would count as public expenditure, at an additional cost of perhaps  5 million a year.42. If legislation were enacted in 1976-77, a roughapproximation of the total cost might be:  million at 1975 Survey prices1977  1978  1979  1980 Total1        -78    -79    -80    -81Acquisition of private ports 50 10     60Acquisition of portbusinesses           30     30     30    90Investment programme of former private ports andbusinesses   ...     -      5      5      5    1550     45     35     35   165Shipping services43. This programme covers the cost of the Coast-guard service including various expenditures on the promotion of safety at sea; ship surveys andexaminations of seamen, which is partly recovered from fees; measures to combat oil pollution; certainsecurity measures in connection with the NorthernIreland emergency; and the United Kingdomsubscription to the Inter-governmental MaritimeConsultive Organisation including a contribution towards the cost of that Organisation^ headquarters in London. Provision for the reorganisation of thecoastguard is made in 1976-77 and 1977-78.37
CIVIL AVIATIONCAA grant-in-aid44. The present forecasts are higher than thosein Cmnd. 5879 mainly because of changedassumptions about the pace of cost recovery foren route navigational services provided by Euro-control. Charges to users are currently aimed atrecovering 30 per cent of the costs of providing theservices. The rate is to be increased in November1975 to a level designed to recover 60 per cent of costs. It remains Government policy to aim atprogressing to 100 per cent cost-recovery inNovember 1977 but the current estimates are basedon the assumption, which seems realistic at thisstage, that Member States will not be persuaded toproceed at this pace and that charges will beincreased in November 1977 to recover 80 per cent of costs and not until November 1979 to recover100 per cent. The figures assume, however, thatthe United Kingdom will succeed in prevailingupon other members of Euro-control to updateannually from November 1976 the costs on whichuser charges are based; at present they are updatedbiennially.45. If, despite the current trend of Euro-controlopinion, Member States can be persuaded to move to 100 per cent cost recovery in November 1977(or if the Government were to decide to proceedto 100 per cent recovery of United Kingdom costsunilaterally from that date) the CAA&apos;s grantrequirements could be reduced as follows:100 per cent cost-recovery from November 1977; cost baseupdated annually  million at 1975 Survey prices1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80-2-0	-6-9	-9-6	-6-746. Full recovery of the CAA&apos;s costs on its other activities by 1977-78, notably the provision of navigation services at aerodromes and personnellicensing, depends largely on Ministers being willingto withstand the protests of users such as pilots and other interested bodies, in particular the regional airport authorities, against unpalatableincreases in the Authority&apos;s charges.47. The current estimates of grant requirementsassume that the CAA will continue to bear the losses at the Highlands and Islands aerodromes.If responsibility for financing the aerodromes wereto be transferred to another body, the Authority&apos;sgrant requirements would be reduced by:  million at 1975 Survey prices1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80-3-6	-1-7	-1-8	-1-8	-1-8However, the actual losses might be lower following a review now taking place of the financial prospects of each aerodrome, including the level of charges.48. The Department of Trade were asked toconsider the consequences of cutting the grant-in-aid by  3 million in 1976-77. Their view is thata cut of  3 million in the grant, if applied solely to staff costs (which account for nearly 60 per cent of total costs in that year) would mean a reductionof about 3 per cent in the CAA&apos;s staff complement.It is doubtful whether this could be achieved without substantial redundancy payments. It might lead to a substantial reduction in activities whichare not immediately productive in the short term,such as research and development, with consequen-tial adverse long-term effects on air safety.Capital investment by the CAA and local authoritiescaa49. The greater part of the Civil aviation authority&apos;s investment programme consists of investment in equipment and installations for theNational Air Traffic Services. The expenditure will provide, inter alia, new radar and flight data processing and associated display equipment at theLondon Air Traffic Control Centre, similar facilities at a new Scottish Centre and new ormodernised navigational aids at aerodromes andfor en route control purposes.50. Expenditure is at a peak in 1975-76 andexceeds the Cmnd. 5879 provision in that year.This is partly because the CAA will have to spend 0 - 7 million on extending the terminal at Sumburghairport in the Shetlands to cope with the very large increase in traffic associated with North Sea oil,and partly because of the fitting-out costs at their new headquarters. The CAA have made savings of over  1 million in 1975-76 to set-off againstthe inclusion of these new items in their programme.51. No allowance is made in the figures for additional expenditure at the CAA&apos;s Highlands and
Islands aerodromes, which has recently been proposed. If approved, this would add  5-8million to the total over the period to 1979-80.local authorities52. Most of the expenditure here relates to major development programmes at Manchester and birmingham airports. In each case there has beena slippage in the timetable. Thus, the presentfigures show reductions on the Cmnd. 5879 fore-casts for 1975-76 and 1976-77 which are partiallyoffset by increases in 1977-78 and 1978-79. Ithas not proved practicable to apply the formula to this programme, and it has been agreed between departments that this expenditure should be treated in accordance with the same criteria as capitalexpenditure by the CAA on their aerodromes.Other civil aviation services53. The major items included here are UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution to euro control and pay-ments by the Government in respect of security measures at airports.54. There is an increase over the Cmnd. 5879provision because of a higher contribution to, and lower recoveries from, euro control. The highercontributions are called for because of increases inEurocontroFs investment and operational budgets,of which the United Kingdom bears a proportion.OTHER TRANSPORT SERVICES55.

Although housing has not been subjected to thethe formula cuts the requirements under the groundrules were:(i) to carry into later years the cuts alreadyimposed on 1976-77 in the ChancellorsBudget statement: these were the cuts of 80 million on subsidies and of  52 million on capital expenditure other than new building;(ii) to assess any policy changes which theDepartment or Treasury consider could bemade to reduce expenditure further.2. Estimating changes in the Housing programmeup to 1st August 1975 have been taken into accounttogether with the effects on expenditures in parti-cular subsidies of economic forecasts revisedfollowing publication of Cmnd. 6151.3. The prospective out-turn in England on uncon-trolled elements in the programme (for examplesubsidies) is uncertain, although there are signs thatin some areas there may be under-spending. against this must be set the certain prospect, revealedimmediately before the Report was completed, ofover-spending, estimated at  80 million, on localauthority mortgage lending, due to commitmentsentered into before the imposition of controls; andthe Treasury have asked the Department to findoffsetting savings. For 1975-76 there is a pros-pective overspend of  14 - 2 million on some elements of the programme in Wales, and the chief secretary has invited the Secretary of State for wales to say what offsetting savings he proposes so as tohold expenditure within the allocated total. NeitherEnglish nor Welsh totals in the table allow for the prospective over-spends.4. For 1976-77 and subsequent years, the fore-casts (except for Wales) see paragraph 6 below represent the programme set out in Cmnd. 5879 withthe Budget reductions incorporated, as modified bythe decision in Cmnd. 6151 to limit rent increases in 1976-77. A large proportion of the forecastsrepresents expenditure on subsidies, whose size issensitive to prices, interest rates and decisions aboutrents; and new building of local authority houses,which is not subject to an aggregate control. Con-trol of other elements of housing expenditure hasbeen extended during 1975-76 to the purchase ofexisting dwellings, improvement investment andmortgage lending by local authorities.5. In Ministerial correspondence earlier this year,the Chief Secretary has expressed the view that theSECRET45
total of public expenditure on housing should nowbe brought under control, including investment in new dwellings. In reply the Secretaries of State have said that they cannot, at the present time, accept a limitation on the level of new house-building.6. Revised estimates of expenditure on subsidies in wales have resulted in increases of the followingamounts from 1976-77 onwards:  million at 1975 Survey prices1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-804-5-1	-1-7-8	-f-7-2	4-8-9In order to contain expenditure in total within themaximum permitted under the ground rules, reduc-tions of a corresponding amount need to be madeelsewhere, and these reductions have been made inthe provisions for local authority mortgage lendingand local authority improvement investment.Subsidiesengland7. The figures are based on a new forecastreplacing that done for Cmnd. 5879 and incor-porating revised assumptions as follows:(i) New investment and council houses sales areassumed to follow the course described below(paragraphs 16 to 19). These give a net increase to the council housing stock ofabout 2\ per cent per year.(ii) The local authority average pool rate ofinterest is assumed to rise from 9-5 per centin 1974-75 to 10-6 per cent in 1976-77 andthen fall to 9-6 per cent by 1979-80. this assumption is critically dependent on move-ments in market rates of interest, especially the short-term market.(iii) Management and maintenance costs in real terms are assumed to stay static in 1975-76as allowed in the Rate Support Grant settle-ment, and thereafter to rise in real terms at about 4 per cent per year. This latterassumption will need to be reviewed in thelight of decisions later this year about allow-able levels of local authority current expendi-ture generally in the Rate Support grant negotiations.(iv) Gross rents which on present indications will rise this year by an average of 50p per weekare assumed to rise next year by an averageof 60 pence per week as foreshadowed in cmnd. 6151. In 1977-78, a real increase of8 per cent is assumed. Thereafter, they areassumed to rise in line with the forecast con-sumer price index.8. The assumptions in paragraph 7 (i) to (iv) enable a forecast to be made of the total deficit on localauthority housing revenue accounts. The majorshare of this is met by Exchequer subsidies under theHousing Rents and Subsidies Act, with the residualmet by Rate Fund Contributions. The estimates of rent Rebates and Allowances are an extrapolationof present levels, on the assumption that the mone-tary limits are adjusted as necessary over the periodso as to preserve the present level of entitlement.9. Subsidy arrangements may be altered before theend of the Survey period as a result of the Review of housing Finance now underway.scotland10. The figures take account of revised and lowerestimates of new building and are based on anannual rent increase progression starting in 1975-76of 25p, 45p, 59p and 33p thereafter. The 1975forecast shows on the whole a slightly lower run of figures than before.Option mortgage11. The option mortgage scheme is designed togive to house purchasers of moderate incomebenefits roughly equal to those available throughtax relief on mortgage interest to basic rate taxpayers. The forecast reflects the increase in subsidynecessary following the change in the basic rateof income tax in the Budget.Grants and loans to housing associations12. Cmnd. 5879 provided for a substantial increasein activity by Housing Associations, following thenew grants for Housing Associations&apos; new building or rehabilitation schemes provided for in theHousing Act 1974. These capital grants are calculated so as to reduce the loan charges onthe scheme to a level that can be met from fairrents, after allowing for management and main-tenance costs. It is estimated that, after paymentof Housing Association grant, about one-quarterof housing association investment will continue tobe financed by loan, and provision for this is contained within the lending figures.
13. The programme of project approvals providedfor is as follows:(thousands of dwellings)1974  1975  1976   1977  1978   1979-75    -76    -77    -78    -79    -80EnglandAcquisition/Conversion .New Building .ScotlandAcquisition/Conversion .New Building .WalesAcquisition/Conversion) .New Building .14-5 15-0 150 150 150 15-028-0  25-0   25-0  25-0  25 0   25-00020-4101-42-251-02-6103-4103-41-21-5    1-5    1-5    1-5    1-5    1-5In Scotland there has been a transfer from improve-ment investment to finance higher housing associa-tion activity in the improvement of sub-standardtenement property. The Scottish Office proposedthat part of the reduction in estimated public sectorhousebuilding expenditure (paragraph 18) rising from  0-5 million in 1975-76 to  2-5 million in1978-79 should also be transferred to housing associations to enable them to increase their build-ing for special groups. But the Treasury have not accepted such a use of estimating savings.House improvement and slum clearance14. The National House Condition Survey 1971estimated that about 1 million dwellings in GreatBritain were unfit and some further 2 millionlacked one or more basic amenities. To deal withthis problem, comprehensive renewal strategies bylocal authorities have been called for, under whichhouses that cannot sensibly be rehabilitated arecleared in as sensitively-managed a way as possible;but in most cases action is taken by authorities togrant-aid renovation of the poorer, privately-ownedhouses under the Housing Act 1974, to improve thelocal environment, to bring property acquired fromthe private-rented sector up to a decent standard and to improve those dwellings on council estateswhich require urgent attention. It is the Govern-menfs policy that expenditure on rehabilitationand environmental treatment should be concentratedwhere there is greatest need, especially in housing action areas.15. Expenditure on improvement to a localauthority&apos;s own dwellings is now controlled inEngland and Wales under Section 105 of the housing act 1974, and under similar powers contained in scottish legislation. To help in deciding hispriorities in relation to this programme and to those for municipalisation and local authority mortgages,the Secretary of State for the Environment has setup a Study Group with the local authority associa-tions and wishes as does the Secretary of State for wales to preserve the option to switch resourcesbetween these items in future years.Housebuilding16. The expenditure figures for new dwellings andassociated land purchase allow for a programme ofnew dwellings approved each year by public authorities as follows:(thousands of dwellings)	1975	1976	1977	1978	1979England:					Local authorities .	100-0	100-0	100-0	100-0	100-0New towns .	12-0	12-0	12-0	12-0	120Scotland:					Local authorities .	12-5	14-3	14-5	15-5	15-5New towns .	3-0	3-0	3-0	2-5	3-scottish Special Housing					Association	3-0	3-2	3-5	3-5	3-wales:					Local authorities .	6-5	6-5	6-5	6-5	6-5New towns .	0-4	0-6	0-4	0-2	0-4Great Britain Total .	137-4	139-6	139-9	140-2	140-917.

In Scotland, the figures for new investment are somewhat lower than before, as a result of a more stringent estimate of local authorities&apos; performance and intentions.SECRET47
Council house sales19. The estimates in Cmnd. 5879 have been reviseddownwards to 3,000 houses per year following thesharp drop in council house sales over the last year.1,200 were sold in 1974-75 compared with 23,260 in1973-74. Sales of public sector houses in new towns have been suspended for the time being inEngland and Wales but not in Scotland.Municipalisation20. Cmnd. 5879 provided for a constant figure of 143 million per year on municipalisation from1975-76 onwards. The programme was overspent in1974-75, and following agreement with TreasuryMinisters earlier this year the provision for 1975-76was increased to  185 million, compensating savingsbeing found from the local authority lending pro-gramme. Local authorities have general loanconsent to purchase property falling within categorieswhich have been redefined in DOE Circular 64/75so as to concentrate the resources in the areas ofworst housing stress.Lending for house purchase21. The figures for 1975-76 in England reflect thedecision to restrict lending in order to financeincreased improvement and municipalisation referredto in paragraph 20 above. Because of the high level at which local authority lending was running at the end of 1974-75, despite the increased avail-ability of building society mortgages, the effect of therestriction has in a number of cases been to compellocal authorities to suspend lending, apart fromhonouring outstanding commitments for the re-mainder of 1975-76 (see paragraph 2 above). Thebuilding societies have agreed in principle to helpmake up the shortfall by an expansion of their ownlending within the limits agreed for house price stability. The figures for later years include a re-duction of  52 million a year following the savingsannounced in the Budget. In Scotland, localauthority lending will be controlled at the same level as previously planned in spite of expenditurelast year which was higher than forecast.POLICY OPTIONSengland22. The Department consider that to put forward proposals for major changes in housing expenditurein advance of the outcome of the current housing finance Review, would be entirely premature. Theyconsider moreover that the Review may welldemonstrate a strong case for additional expenditureon certain heads. Treasury officials after some preliminary discussion with the Department, have however asked that the report should deal with threesuggestions for further cuts in housing expenditure:(i) Local authority mortgage lending, municipalis-ation and improvement investment. Cmnd.5879 as adjusted for the  100 million switchprovided for sums totalling  712 million, in1978-79, but the continuation of the 1976-77Budget savings has reduced this by  52 mil-lion. Officials have considered the implications-tions of increasing this cut to  260 million,in 1978-79.(ii) New house building. The forecast in themain table follows Cmnd. 5879 in extra-polating the current level of approvals of newdwellings over the Survey period the Englishlocal authority level is currently 100,000 per year. Officials have considered the implications-tions of initiating a limit on new housebuilding and reducing the levels of approvalsto 90,000 per year giving a saving in 1978-79of about  110 million.(iii) Subsidies. The forecast in the main tableassumes that council house rents in 1976-77will rise by 60p on average and will increase by 8 per cent in real terms in 1977-78.Officials have considered the possibility offurther annual increases of rent (averaging 8per cent per week in real terms) over and above the CPI in 1978-79. This additionalincrease would be intended to reducesubsidies by  60 million in 1978-79.Local   authority   lending,   municipalisation   andimprovement23. The Treasury suggestion for a further 208 million cut would require expenditure in1978-79 to be kept to  452 million, compared witha provision in 1974-75 of  916 million and an out-turn of  1,070 million. The fall in prospect from1975-76 under existing agreed provision alreadypresents severe difficulties for the DOE; it is asfollows:  million at 1975 Survey prices1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79757 662 645 660
24. For the current financial year, even afterswitching  103 million from lending for house pur-chase to municipalisation and improvement expendi-ture, it has been necessary to restrict the categories of property which may be municipalised, and severely to ration improvement expenditure; whilethe halving of local authority lending for house pur-chase has forced most local authorities to stoplending for the second half of the year, apart fromfulfilling commitments.25. The three programmes are important elements in the Governments policies for older housing.Lending by local authorities particularly assists those with lower incomes purchasing older houses.Municipalisation is being concentrated on acquisi-tion of the worst housing in the private rentedsector, in pursuit of the policy under the housing act 1974 of concentrating improvement effort intothe worst areas of housing stress. The improvementprovision as well as providing for the improvementof acquired houses, also has to support the work of bringing the worst of the existing council housing upto reasonable standards.26. The relative balance between lending, muni-cipalisation and improvement as components of housing policy is being examined in the housing finance Review and in the study group mentionedin paragraph 15. The Department consider thatno sensible decisions about relativities can be takenin advance of the outcome of these studies, but that because the total for the three heads, alreadysubject to the  52 million cut, is already underextreme pressure, it should not be cut further.27. In the Treasury&apos;s view, a reduction in thelevel of investment in the purchase of existing houses and in improvement, while slowing downprogress in these areas would represent an unavoidable-able rephasing if expenditure is to be reduced. Thereduction to  452 million in 1978-79 compares witha total for these three elements together of  411 mil-lion in 1970-71. A cut in local authority mortgagelending would bring local authorities&apos; activitiesback to a much lower level, but should still enablethem to concentrate on applicants who are unableto qualify for building society mortgages.New housebuilding28. In the DOE&apos;s view, to introduce a limit onthe new council house building programme, evenif it were not applied in certain areas, would beSECRETinconsistent with the severe criticism which ministers have levelled at the previous conservative administration for the low level of council housebuilding during their period of office and wouldbe seen as inconsistent with the Governmentsdeclared policy of giving priority to new house-building. The current forecast of 100,000 for localauthorities is well below what they achieved inthe second half of the 1960s, and a reductionwhether to 90,000 or to some intermediate figure would be regarded as a change of emphasis in the effort going to house the lower income household.In the Treasury view, current and prospectiveeconomic circumstances require a limit to be placedon the aggregate of public expenditure on housing.This implies controlling the total of new house-building in the public sector, which would not be inconsistent with continuing to give it priority, andwould not require a restriction on building in theareas of greatest stress.Subsidies29. The Secretary of State for the Environmenthas stated publicly that rents must meet a greater proportion of the cost of public housing. TheTreasury proposal would however entail real rent increases from 1977-78 onwards of 8 per cent ayear. In the Departments view it is unrealistic to suppose that increases of this size over two succes-sive years could be guaranteed at this distance intime.30. On the present forecast, the percentage of costs borne by net rents already rises from 43per cent in 1975-76 to 47 per cent in 1979-80. Ifabove this were superimposed a real rent increaseof the scale suggested, the contribution of rentsfrom existing tenants would be of such a size as to eliminate the need for any rate fund contribution towards new housing. This would be particularlytrue of housing authorities with building pro-grammes low in relation to existing stock. tenants of older council houses would be on good ground in resisting such steep increases.31. Nor could the increases be achieved within thepresent legislative framework of the Housing rents and Subsidies Act 1975. Amendment to the Actwould in the Departments view be necessary both to compel local authorities to make rent increasesthey would otherwise refuse to carry through andto reduce their existing entitlement to certainGovernment subsidies.49
32. The Treasury recognise that if the proportionof housing costs which is met from rents is to be restored to the level of 72 per cent which obtained in 1970-71, the present generous rate of CentralGovernment subsidy would have to be reduced, andthis would require fresh legislation. The oppor-tunity for this will occur when new legislation is introduced following the Review of housing finance. As it is highly desirable to maintain the incentive for local authorities to increase the shareof housing costs borne by rents, plans could now bemade accordingly.scotland33. Total reductions of about  50 million in1978-79 might be achieved as follows:(i) Reduction in improvement investment ofabout  30 million a year, starting with theprogramme authorised to start in 1977-78.Expenditure outside priority areas wouldhave to cease; in addition, there would be asubstantial diminution of the resources available for improvement in multiply-deprived areas.(ii) A reduction of 1,000 approvals per year for new house building from 1976 onwardswould yield about  10 million. This would almost certainly require the introduction of programme controls.(iii) An additional rent increase in real terms of30p a week in 1978-79 would yield about 12 million. It would be extremely difficultto persuade local authorities to carry it out,and under the present interim housing finance system, there is no means of ensuring that they would do so.wales34. The Welsh Office agree generally with theDepartment of the Environments views; in parti-cular that proposals for major changes in housing expenditure would be premature in advance of theHousing Finance Review. Wales has special problems in the incidence of older housing and thehigh level of unfitness; and local authority mortgagelending is relatively more important than in Englandbecause of the greater proportion of older buildings which do not satisfy Building Society criteria forloans. Reductions totalling  16 million in 1978-79might be achieved as follows:  million(i) Improvement  investment/acquisition/local authority mortgage lending .     .  8(ii) a reduction of 400 in new dwellingapprovals......4(iii) additional rent increases of 28p in1978-79 onwards      .     .     .     .4

This programme comprises a wide variety of services concerned with public health, improvementof the environment, and the development of localfacilities and amenities, most of which are the responsibilities of local authorities. It also includesexpenditure on water and sewerage services.SECRETWater supply, conservation and sewerage2. The nine Regional Water Authorities in Englandand the Welsh National Water development authority (WNWDA) are responsible for themanagement of water supply and conservation and sewerage, together with sewage disposal, the preven-tion of water pollution, fisheries and amenity and53
recreation associated with water. The bulk ofcapital expenditure on the services provided by theAuthorities is devoted to water supply and thedisposal of sewage to match domestic and industrialrequirements. In determining the direction of their capital investment programmes since their establish-ment last year the Regional Water Authorities andWNWDA have been asked by Departments to give priority to the avoidance of public health risks andthe provision of services for new housing andindustry. Investment by the regional and islandscouncils in Scotland is subject to similar priorities.3. Cmnd. 5879 assumed an average rate of growth of 7 per cent a year in expenditure on water services from 1974-75 onwards, taking account of the extraassistance to the construction industry in 1975-76announced by the Chancellor in September 1974. Inthe years between 1965-66 and 1973-74, investment in water services had grown at the rate of 10  percent a year. During this period a start was made onimproving rivers by bringing some sewage treatmentup to minimum standards but at the end of theperiod there was still serious deficiencies in sewagetreatment and there had been virtually no renewal orreplacement of obsolete and decaying sewers exceptincidentally to the enlargement of sewerage systemsto accommodate new development.4. It is possible that the reduced programme for1976-77 shown above will be barely enough to ser-vice the housing programme and new industrialdevelopment (and could cause difficulties in par-ticular areas, including New Towns); that it will lead to further deterioration in some rivers; that itwill allow nothing to be devoted to renewals andreplacements; and that there will be no margin topermit increased expenditure resulting from the implementation of the water provisions in theControl of Pollution Act 1974. Continuation at about the same level in England and Wales in subse-quent years (the consequence of the formula cuts)could produce accumulating difficulties in servinghousing and industry, while the problems due tofailure to cater for other needs could escalate. Itwould therefore probably be impracticable to meetthe Governmenfs priorities in housing, industry andthe prevention of serious public health risks withouta measure of growth in expenditure on water ser-vices from the reduced 1976-77 level. The estimates in the main Report provide in general for a growth rate of 3 per cent a year from 1976-77 but theDepartment of the Environment and the welsh office doubt whether this will be adequate to satisfybasic needs. It may be necessary, in the light offurther assessment of the requirements for waterservices, to adjust those estimates to cater for ahigher growth rate (the DOE&apos;s present view is that5 per cent a year might be justified), possibly with acall on the contingency reserve. There may be similar difficulties in Scotland, where the Surveyguidelines result in a marked downward trend in theprogramme. Although forecast expenditure on oil-related programmes has not been cut, it is possiblethat over the period the estimates could necessitate the delay of some housing developments because oflack of provision for sewage treatment.Improvement of the environment and local facilitiescapital5. In England and Wales, capital expenditure onthese services falls almost entirely within the locally determined sector (LDS) where block borrowingapproval is given not only for these services but also for, e.g. transport, some education and other expendi-ture. Local authorities have in recent years spent agreater proportion of their locally determined sectorallocation on Other Environmental Services than fore-cast, but this pattern may not continue. This means that expenditure on Other Environmental services could decline significantly from that in recent yearsand the provision for renewal of capital facilities willbe much below that to which local authorities haverecently been accustomed. It is not possible to sayexactly what measures local authorities will adopt to achieve the required savings, but the general pictureis indicated by the following paragraphs which apply equally to Scotland.6. Within Other Environmental Services authorities will be bound to make adequate provision for expenditure on refuse services and administration,including additional expenditure on waste disposaland the control of noise if the relevant sections of theControl of Pollution Act are implemented. Thismeans that authorities will probably take a substan-tially greater cut in expenditure on recreation(sharply reversing the rapid rise of such expenditurein recent years), and to some extent on town and country planning. Although there must be, in refusecollection and disposal, an adequate ability to pro-vide replacement of existing facilities as they becomeexhausted, there will be no room for innovation.
For administration only the most urgent and modestoffice buildings would be provided for and localauthority staff morale and efficiency will suffer. Itmay be that no more planning redevelopmentschemes can be approved for grant; there wouldbe reduced spending on aid to industrialists, ratesof improvement in smoke control would be halted.The scope for comprehensive measures to alleviateurban deprivation, badly needed in, for example,West Central Scotland, will be seriously limited.7. In short, if the reductions are maintained, itshould be possible to provide both for refuse andadministrative services but it will be impossible toprovide supporting facilities to currently acceptedstandards for new housing development and therewill be a progressive reduction in the standards ofthe supporting services for the improvement of the environment.current8. The fall in expenditure will mean that there maybe some deterioration of standards in services as existing staffs will have to support any new develop-ment as well as existing developments. New capitalfacilities will have to be supported by chargessufficiently high to recoup costs or by increased efficiency.9. On recreational services there will have to beincreases in charges, some facilities perhaps beingclosed down and nothing new being provided unless it is self-financing. For refuse, standards may dropwith authorities seeking to change to inferior butcheaper systems, although the Control of PollutionAct relating to solid and toxic wastes, if imple-mented, will require higher standards in some cases and impose additional duties on local authorities.All loss-making waste reclamation schemes willhave to cease. There will have to be greater co-operation between authorities in the use of planning staff, and no new duties imposed, apartfrom those required by the Community Land Scheme(see paragraph 16). The tasks of local governmentwill take longer to perform. There can be no realincrease in members&apos; allowances. Living and work-ing conditions will suffer if authorities have toslacken their endeavours to abate air pollution, gritdust and smells, with the provisions of the Control of pollution Act, if implemented, increasing pressuresSECRETin the opposite direction. Local authority trading services (mainly cemeteries and crematoria) will need to raise their charges substantially to bring them closer to being self-financing.New towns industrial and commercial develop-ments10. This heading includes expenditure by NewTown Corporations on land and site servicing forshops, offices and factories in new towns and also,in so far as they are not borne by privatedevelopers, some construction costs as well. It isexpenditure analogous to commercial and industrialdevelopment of nationalised industries. The alloca-tion was cut back in 1974-75 in line with that forother services in this programme. This reductionrequired significant economies in the timing and nature of the provision in new towns. Much ofthe provision is in assisted areas and overall a high level of new town development is still plannedover the next few years. In view of these factors,and subject to further examination to establish the precise needs for this type of investment in new towns, it has been agreed that for 1977-78onwards expenditure of  35 million a year shouldbe included for England, with  12-7 million a year for Scotland and  lf-2 million for Wales.Royal Palaces and Royal Parks, historic buildings and ancient monuments11. This item covers expenditure on the main-tenance, etc., of the Royal Palaces and Royal Parksthroughout the United Kingdom. Provision is also made for grants to owners for the repair of historicbuildings, for other related services and for expendi-ture on the purchase, maintenance, repair anddisplay of ancient monuments, including emergencyexcavations to record monuments before sites aredeveloped.12. A reduction in the maintenance standards ofthese buildings would be a false economy possiblyleading to irreplaceable losses. Therefore expendi-ture in this sector is to be kept to the levelapproved for 1976-77. The savings foregone areto be found from the Other Environmental Services.13. No allowance has been made for any additional expenditure on the acquisition, preservation-tion and running of historic houses arising from theoperation of the Wealth Tax.55
Environmental research14. This item covers expenditure by the Depart-ment of the Environment on its three researchstations, on Departmentally-sponsored extra-muralresearch and on grants to research associations and bodies. There will be a cutting back of plannedincreases in the number of research staff andgeneral savings in DOE&apos;s external research pro-grammes. The present activity level of the centre for Environmental Studies will be maintained. Theallocation of the reduced provision to individualresearch programmes will be considered by theProgramme Review Committee in October in thelight of general priorities seen at that time, butthe Department consider that in general, the reducedprogramme will impose severe restraint on theDepartment^ ability to carry out required research.The Treasury point out that between 1974-75 and1976-77 this programme benefited from a sub-stantial uplift, and even with savings greater thanthe formula cuts in 1978-79 and 1979-80 theprogramme has not been reduced substantially below the forecast 1976-77 level.Central and miscellaneous environmental services:Specialised environmental services15. The Countryside Commissions and NatureConservancy Council, together with the SportsCouncils, provide a small group of specialisedcentral and miscellaneous environmental services,operating on small and tightly drawn budgets.For 1977-78 and later years the Department ofthe Environment have provided for a modestincrease in expenditure by the Nature ConservancyCouncil to enable it to carry out at least its most pressing statutory functions. The provision for the countryside Commission in England and Wales hasbeen maintained at Cmnd. 5879 levels; neverthelessthis will require some curtailment of their planned expansion of experimental research and information work. In England the Sports Council has beenshielded from the full effect of the reductions toenable it still to take a lead in, and make a con-tinuing financial commitment to a number of projects to which the Department of the Environment attach importance. The Welsh Office also propose a gradual expansion of the Sports Council for Waleswith particular emphasis on the encouragement and support of governing bodies in Wales and on grants for capital expenditure. There is also a modestexpansion in expenditure by the Scottish SportsCouncil on sports facilities. The reductions ingrants to the wide range of other bodies in this programme could markedly impair their viabilityor effectiveness. The cut in the Cmnd. 5879figures for 1976-77 and later years has not been applied to any of these services, but compensatorysavings have been found within Department of the environment administration, and EnvironmentalResearch.Community Land Scheme16. This is a new item which will provide forthe capitalised purchase, administrative and interestcosts to local authorities (and in Wales, the LandAuthority for Wales) and the New Town Develop-ment Corporations of land acquisition. In the1974 Survey report provision was included in the contingency Reserve. Local authorities will buyand make available development land in their areas.DOE and Scottish and Welsh Offices are anxiousto take urgent action to ensure as much land aspossible is brought forward to meet what may bea land availability problem, particularly for housing,and therefore to provide for a fast build-up in opera-tions and turn round of disposal receipts under thescheme. This will also help minimise the length oftime before local authorities&apos; land accounts move into surplus and the Exchequers share accrues. Theprogramme indicates the anticipated rate of build-upof the scheme based on assumptions about availablemanpower and an initial timelag as compulsory purchase processes are gone through, and on theassumption that development land tax is introduced at 80 per cent.17. In the view of the DOE and Scottish and welsh offices, it is impossible to say how much lower tax would have to be to alter the situation. A verymuch lower rate, say under 60 per cent, which would present practical fiscal problems, could be expectedto make vendors more willing to sell. It is much less likely that any variations in tax which kept therate at 60 per cent or above would have much effect.At tax levels of 60 per cent or more local authorities would still, in the view of DOE and Scottish and welsh Offices, have to buy as much land as theycould to make sure that there was a continuingsupply of land for development. The constraintswhich would limit the volume of expenditure on land would therefore be those of the availability of staff,the time taken by purchase procedures, etc.   The
figures in this Report are based on this full pro-gramme of local authority acquisitions which thedepartments concerned think necessary if the schemeis to be a success and sufficient land made availablefor development. If the programme is to be a success then the result of the preparatory work in theearly years will be that the programme would rise toa maximum cost of  135 million (Great Britain) in1978-79 and begin to fall thereafterwards as pro-ceeds of sales exceed the cost of purchases. Thesefigures are the departments&apos; best estimates. It hasnot been possible to draw on local authorities&apos; ownestimates since none will be available until thescheme is in operation.18. The Treasury note that these tentative esti-mates assume that the amount of expenditure willbe limited solely by the availability of staff, the time taken by compulsory purchase procedures, etc.; butthat so far there has been no collective Ministerialconsideration of the precise scale of expenditure which should be approved for the purpose of thescheme. In their view, Ministers will wish to con-sider whether an open-ended commitment should beaccepted or whether it should be subject to specifiedannual cash limits; and, if limits are to be imposed,whether these should be at or lower than the present estimates, rising to say  100 million (instead of 135 million) in 1978-79.19. A necessary consequence of the scheme is the strengthening of Central Government to provide it with the necessary staff, many of whom will bebased in regional offices. Separate figures aregiven this year as the scheme forms a whollynew addition to public expenditure: in subsequent years these figures will be incorporated within the&quot; central and miscellaneous environmental services &quot;subhead.Thames Tidal Flood Protection Scheme20. A reduction of  7-3 million has already beenmade in 1976-77 and this has entailed somerephasing of the scheme, mainly on works down-stream of the Barrier itself. To exact the &quot; formula &quot;cuts amounting to  10-2 million in 1977-78 and 8-3 million in 1978-79, would place in jeopardythe protection of the downstream areas and possibly even Central London to an extent which is unaccept-able in terms of the risk of loss of life, industrialdisruption and damage to property. Ninety per cent of contracts for the Barrier itself are already letand thus the whole of the &quot; formula&quot; cuts fallagainst the unlet part of the downstream worksbeing carried out by Water Authorities. This results in an effective cut of 30 per cent on these works in each year. The only savings which might bemade without creating unacceptable risks would beby delaying the second stage on certain less vulner-able lengths where work is to be carried out in two stages. The total savings which might be achieved by this means in the period 1977-79 would be about 5 million and these are reflected in the figures inthe table.SECRET57

introduction. Most of the expenditure on law, order andprotective services is accounted for by localauthority services which are manpower-intensive.2. More than half the total expenditure goes onthe police; and manpower accounts for about 80per cent of police expenditure.3. Amongst the Home Office services the highest priority has been given to police manpower; thishas been made clear in successive White papers on public expenditure and the rate support grant,and there has been an assurance that if recruitmentexceeded expectation, additional money would befound so that police forces would not be inhibitedfrom recruiting up to their authorised establish-ments. The narrative in the following paragraphshas been written by the Home Office with theassumption that Ministers will continue to take thesame view of the priority to be attached to policerecruitment. The Treasury, however, do not accept that this degree of priority should necessarily beassumed to continue.4. To avoid cuts on police current expenditure under the formula, extremely severe reductions would have to be made on the remainder of thelaw and order programmes. It is impracticable,given the nature of the programmes, to findequivalent savings from other current expenditure,and cuts of over 60 per cent in 1978-79 wouldhave to be made in planned capital expenditure for police, fire, courts, probation and after-careservices, and prisons.ENGLAND AND WALESAdministration of Justice5. The programme covers expenditure on bothhigher and lower courts as well as the costs incurred by departments concerned with theadministration of justice.court services. The forecasts provide for the running costs of magistrates&apos; Courts and capital expenditure on theprovision of court buildings, including the replace-ment of existing buildings taken over for use asCrown Courts under the Courts Act 1971. all expenditure is the responsibility of local authorities,but the Central Government pays a grant of 80 percent of approved expenditure. Current expenditurecovers the staff and goods and services necessaryto cope with the increasing work load of the courts.7. The various cuts already made on the Magis-trates&apos; Courts building allocations and, in particular,the cut applied in November 1974 to the 1978-79forecast, have disrupted the building programme.The expenditure shown in Table 9 will leave avery small programme of new work for 1976-77but no programme of new work for 1977-78 or1978-79. The large building programme whichhas been progressively deferred for some years would therefore come to a halt for a time. Whilethe smaller courthouses, especially those which donot sit daily, can possibly cope with inadequateconditions for a few more years, the major centresare already overburdened and required to deal witha growth of business which has at least doubledaccommodation needs in the last 10 years. Alsomany courts have been required to give upadditional accommodation to the Crown Courtssharing the courthouse. To meet these urgentneeds courthouses were being planned for Innerand Outer London and many of the majorprovincial cities. The amounts now to be availablefor the later years would be needed to continueschemes started in earlier years for Inner Londonalone. To speed up work. where accommodation would otherwise be inadequate it may be necessaryto employ more stipendiary magistrates.8. Current expenditure on Magistrates&apos; Courts ismore than offset by fines collected ( 32 million in1973-74-which do not appear in Table 9); andthis reflects the volume of work over which neitherthe courts nor the Government can exercise any effective control. Previous forecasts made modestprovision for the rise in such business, which hascontinued unabated for many years. (For example,there were proceedings against 406,277 people in1974 for indictable offences compared with 220,797in 1964.) Courts cannot turn work away; the only effective way of achieving the level of expenditureshown in Table 9 would be by legislating to reducethe number or types of cases going for hearing.This might, for example, be done by introducingfixed penalties for a wider range of motoringoffences.9. For the higher courts, the level of capitalexpenditure will permit work to proceed on the nineschemes referred to in Cmnd. 5879 at a reducedannual rate, with consequent delay in completion.
It also entails deferment for at least a year of five of the eight schemes planned to start in 1979-80.10. The Courts Act 1971 enabled the Crown court to retain until 1981 the accommodation formerlyused by Assizes and Quarter Sessions in order togive sufficient time for replacement courts to be built. Successive cuts in the level of expenditureimposed in recent years mean that some of thesecourts cannot now be built in time. It will there-fore be necessary to consider legislating to extend the period during which the Crown Court maycontinue to occupy the present accommodation.11. The main part of the gross current expenditureon the courts depends on the number of cases withwhich they have to deal. On civil business this is largely offset by court fees. Net expenditure hasbeen reduced from 1977-78 by some reduction in staff. In addition, action to reduce the size ofcivil and criminal juries from 12 to 10 persons might also be needed. Any further reduction in net expenditure could be achieved only by further increases in fees which would tend to put the courtsbeyond the reach of those with moderate means,who do not qualify for legal aid.legal aid12. Expenditure on civil legal aid is estimated torise by an average of 3  per cent a year but has beenreduced by  1 -2 million in 1978-79 on the assump-tion that by then legal aid will have been withdrawnfrom certain undefended divorce cases to which thesimplified special procedure applies. This requiresregulations subject to affirmative resolution whichare likely to be heavily attacked, particularly by government supporters.13. Expenditure on criminal legal aid rises muchfaster 9 per cent a year in the Magistrates&apos; courts and 7 per cent in the higher courts and there is astrong case for putting some limit to this open-ended commitment. It would be possible to cut it by statutory restrictions in entitlement, but only if ministers were prepared to accept the political un-popularity of doing this when most of the pressureis to increase the range of cases for which legal aidis available. There might also be scope for off-setting some of the expenditure by increasing revenue from Contribution Orders, but only at the cost of extra court staff and the result might be to addmarginally to the prison population. The best hope for savings is to move cases from the Crown court to the Magistrates&apos; Courts where the average legalcost per case is about a third of the Crown Courtfigure. The awaited recommendations of the JamesCommittee on the work of Magistrates&apos; Courts arelikely to be of some assistance here (possibly savingabout  1 million a year in legal aid costs) but legis-lation will be required. None of the aforementionedpossible economy measures are reflected in theexpenditure shown in Table 9.Treatment of offendersprisons14. In Cmnd. 5879 it was assumed that the numberof prisoners would rise from 36,800 to 40,000 in1978-79, but the total has risen sharply since last autumn; is now over 40,500, the highest figure ever.There could be over 42,000 in custody by 1978-79.15. Staff costs account for over 80 per cent of allcurrent expenditure on prisons. In spite of steadystaff growth in recent years a high rate of overtimeis still necessary to meet increased commitments.Cmnd. 5879 envisaged an increase in non-industrialstaff from 17,100 to 22,300 in 1978-79, accompaniedby a reduction in overtime expenditure. the reduced provision in Table 9 would permit anincrease to between 20,500 and 21,000 in 1979-80,depending on whether overtime could be reducedstill further. Most of the growth will be needed toman new accommodation coming into use during the survey period, leaving little margin to meetincreasing court commitments, and to fulfil the requirement to reduce overtime. The results wouldbe continuing severe restrictions of facilities for prisoners. The effect will be aggravated if thepresent unexpectedly sharp increase in populationcontinues, and the consequences for control,discipline and security may be serious.16. The capital expenditure programme in Cmnd.5879 would have provided 6,700 new prison placesover the Survey period and allowed starts to bemade on 3,300 further places to come into use bythe mid-1980s; would have improved the working,education and welfare facilities in existing prisons,and enabled a modest start to be made on replace-ment and refurbishing schemes. 1 Capital expendi-ture on place producing schemes has been cut by30-40 per cent in 1977-78 and about 60-70 percent in 1978-79. The revised provision wouldprovide about 5,000 new places in the Survey period and permit starts on 1,000 further places to comeinto use by the mid-1980s.   There are at present
about 35,500 places in the system, coping with a population of just over 40,000; as on present estimates the number of new places coming into use would exceed the likely increase in population, some reduction might be made in the present number of15,000 living two or three in a cell designed for one,but overcrowding would continue into the 1980s,leaving well over half the prison population in build-ings constructed in the last century (with theirappalling sanitary arrangements) or in convertedSecond World War service camps.17. Only a bare minimum of maintenance andrefurbishing could be afforded within the reducedcapital programme with no scope for the much-needed modernisation of 19th century prisons andfor saving converted Second World War servicecamps from dereliction; for the expansion of work-shop, education and visiting facilities, which wouldhave eased some of the difficulties arising from con-tinued over-crowding; and for the replacement of sub-standard staff quarters.probation and after care18. Cmnd. 5879 assumed an increase in the numberof probation officers from 4,180 to 5,640 over theperiod to 1978-79, to meet the expected growth in existing commitments and new duties stemmingfrom recent legislation without increasing theindividual work load. On 1st April 1973 there were4,433 officers in post, an increase of 13 over the forecast in Cmnd. 5879. The revised provision would mean that the number of officers could beincreased by a further 450 instead of a further 1,200over the current Survey period to a total of 4,900.This reduction in growth of 700-800 would placeincreasing strain on the service and delay the exten-sion of community service order facilities throughoutEngland and Wales.19. Against the Cmnd. 5879 programme of 19 daytraining centres by 1978-79, it will be possible tocomplete only about 10 by 1979-80.20. The present number of places in adult proba-tion and bail hostels is just over 400. The reducedprovision will allow an increase to 1,600 as againstthe 1,900 planned for. In addition it would benecessary to defer provision of 30 probation hostelsfor young offenders which it had been planned to start towards the end of the period.21. By no longer supporting new and experimentalafter-care projects the existing number of after-carehostels could be maintained.22. No further expansion by the National Associa-tion for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders andother organisations on schemes to keep people outof prison would be possible.23. The reduced allocations for magistrates&apos; court-houses mean refusing separate building proposalsfor probation offices because the latter have to be confined to the magistrates&apos; courthouses of whichthey form part.General protective servicespolice24. The programme of building up police strengthsstarts from a higher level in 1975-76 than was assumed in Cmnd. 5879 and improvements infacilities for training and scientific and technicalsupport will continue; but for a period of two yearsno new operational buildings would be started orbadly out of date ones replaced.25. Cmnd. 5879 provided for an increase of about10,000 officers over the Survey period from 1st April 1974 with the caveat that if more recruitscame along within the limits of authorised establish-ments the money would be found to pay for them(but see Treasury comment in paragraph 3 above).Police strengths are expected to grow from 102,750(compared with the assumption of 101,850 in Cmnd.5879) on 1st April 1975 to 113,000 over the newperiod. The increase of 10,250 represents anaverage annual increase of almost 2 per cent.26. On 1st April 1975 the number of civilians,other than traffic wardens and cadets, in post was33,640 which exceeded earlier forecasts by 2,800.There were 6,160 traffic wardens 640 fewer; and4,850 cadets 200 more. The estimate provides forfurther growth over the period of about 2,400 ofwhom three-quarters would be traffic wardens.27. Provision is made for improved training facilities, for the planned development of the PoliceNational Computer system and the forensic sciencelaboratories; for continuing research; -and for theintroduction of the independent procedure for investigating complaints against the police. In-creased provision is made for communicationsequipment and operational vehicles, though lessthan in previous forecasts.28. The programme of new building up to 1976-77has already been held to a very low level; no new work would be possible under the reduced provision
for the following two years, but some resumptionwould be allowed in 1979-80. By the end of the survey period the scale and standard of manyoperational buildings would be far short of require-ments of the service, and site acquisitions would be severely restricted to the prejudice of future schemes.The allocation for police houses would be held to a level below the requirement, with a consequent increase in rent allowance payments.fire services29. The estimates assume that the number of whole-time, retained and junior firemen would remain at the present levels of 30,000, 14,200 and150 respectively throughout the period, and that thenumber of civilian staff would remain at nearly4,800. Limiting numbers to these levels would depend on the co-operation of local authorities asthe Central Government has no power of enforce-ment.30. The fireman&apos;s working week was reduced from56 to 48 hours in November 1974 and the Union are pressing for a further reduction to 40 hours. On thebasis of present organisation this would require anincrease of up to 5,000 firemen.31. Expenditure on goods and services would bemaintained at current levels.32. There would be a reduction in the service givenby the Fire Service Technical College and in the size of the Home Office fire research programme.33. The large reduction in local authority capitalexpenditure on the fire service would lead to thecontinuance in service of many out-of-date firestations; and would make it difficult to replace fireappliances and vehicles which are well past theiruseful working life, with consequent risk of serious loss of operational efficiency.other protective services34. Most of this expenditure is concerned withthe administration of controls on immigration andnationality.35. The proposed cut on the Cmnd. 5879 provisioncould probably be tolerated within the existing commitments of the immigration service at the portsup to 1978. If there were to be expansion of smallerports, and this is quite likely now that the ChannelTunnel is defunct, there could be a problem.36. A note on the effect of staff reductions on thequality of service is included below in paragraph 44.Civil defence37. Annual expenditure by the Home Officeamounts to between  6 million and  7 million cover-ing in order of priority, warning and monitoring,central training, grants to county councils, policy,administration and scientific work and stockpiles. Areduction of about  0-5 million could be achievedmainly by reducing the size of the stockpile of fire service equipment.38. The effect of the proposed cuts on the HomeDefence PSA building programme is further to defer the completion of vital protected accommodation for regional Commissioners in war. Work on UnitedKingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisationprojects and the Home Defence College would continue broadly as planned with some delays. the credibility in NATO of our domestic arrangements could only be maintained by concealing the news ofthese cuts.39. The Department of Energy is responsible forthe operation and maintenance of the Governmentsoil storage and pipeline system for civil defence purposes. 50 per cent of the gross expenditure is associated with commercial and service use. InTable 9 receipts exceed expenditure from 1977-78.Additional expenditure of  0-4 million in 1977-78, 0-8 million in 1978-79 and  1-0 million in 1979-80will be needed unless the proposed review of oil storage requirements results in changes in present government policy.Community services40. Within this sub-programme, priority has beengiven to the promotion of good Community relations and to the Voluntary Services sector. Expenditureof  2-3 million on the Community RelationsCommisson and the Race Relations Board wouldenable these agencies to maintain and expand their current level of activity in 1976-77, but thereafter the present annual rate of growth of expenditure would be reduced. If Parliament legislates for anew Race Relations Commission to supersede thetwo existing agencies, the new body could be in full operation by the beginning of 1977-78 and the costcontained within the revised level of expenditure.The development of the Equal OpportunitiesCommission would be able to go ahead as plannedfollowing the April 1975 cuts.
41. The cuts would mean reducing the amountof new capital approvals each year under the mainUrban Programme from  4-5 million to  2-9million in 1977-78 and  1-5 million in 1978-79.The Urban Programme would cease to be viablewith so small a capital sum available for new projects (though existing revenue commitmentswould continue to be honoured); nor would it be feasible to proceed with the development of Com-prehensive Community Programmes on the basisat present proposed. This would mean that theHome Office would no longer have any programmedirected at tackling urban deprivation.42. There is a case for applying the whole of anysuch savings from the Urban Programme to augment the funds available to the voluntary services Unit because any reduction in the grants to voluntary bodies leading to loss of services wouldbe disproportionate to the small savings achieved.Moreover voluntary service has an outstanding part to play at a time when statutory services may be run down; and voluntary bodies are themselves notonly suffering the effects of inflation but are beingincreasingly deprived of the charitable sources that have traditionally been available.Central and miscellaneous services43. The costs of some central staffs are attributed to other sub-programmes, but the effects of the restricted levels of expenditure are more con-veniently explained in the comprehensive notebelow.STAFF44. In order to meet the continuing growth ofwork, provision was made in Cmnd. 5879 for about,000 extra non-industrial staff for the Home Officeapart from the Prison Service. To achieve the required savings this growth would have to bereduced to about 1,100 over the Survey period. Itis not, at this stage, possible to determine relativepriorities for use of staff resources over the survey period; demands upon the Home Office are madeon so many fronts that maximum flexibility ofdeployment of staff between the different HomeOffice responsibilities is essential. Two-thirds ofthe planned increase, however, was in areas sup-porting the operational services of Immigration,Police and Fire, and the growth was geared toexpected increases in work loads. implementation of the cuts in projected growth of staff would mean that these services would have to accept theconsequences of slower responses and lowerstandards of support. Generally, increases in thenumber of cases dealt with by the Home Officedepend upon factors not within Departmentalcontrol, e.g. increases in crime or in applications from visitors, and immigrants. Reductions in cor-responding staff growth involves delay in resolvingcases and in responses to Ministers, Members ofParliament and the public. There would also bereduction of staff effectiveness because the standards of internal services and resources devoted to staffmanagement would have to be reduced.SCOTLAND45. The passages which follow analyse the effects of the cuts as they fall according to the formulaon the various services. A paragraph in eachsection comments on the effects of redistributingexpenditure in line with the priorities adopted bythe Home Office for England and Wales.Administration of Justicecourt services46. Central Government became responsible forsheriff court houses from 1 April 1973. Only since that time has it been possible to plan a forwardprogramme of building to meet long-wanted needs,and since 16 May 1975, to take account of there organisation of sheriff court districts. Severerestrictions would result from the proposed cuts in investment. Apart from the replacement of the sheriff Court in Glasgow, which is well forward in planning and has the highest priority, the restricted programme would allow only one othernew court before 1980; and only a few of theextensions needed for a steadily increasing work-load throughout the country.47. Despite extra expenditure to meet the cost of increased court business and the introduction of security arrangements, net expenditure shown inTable 9 has been reduced by increasing court feesby 1978-79 by about half of the amount of inflationsince they were last increased in 1969-70. such increases would require the approval of the lord president of the Court of Session. Apart from theLord Presidents known views on keeping fees ata token level, the Scottish Courts Administrationconsider that such large increases may havepresentational difficulties.
Treatment of offendersprisons48. The capital programme would provide 553 newprison places against a likely population increase ofabout 1,000 by the end of the period, and overcrowd-ing would increase; the planned provision of newstaff quarters would be reduced by nearly half.Non-industrial staff would be levelled off at less than2,500, against a planned increase of about 600 ormore to alleviate existing under-manning and theneeds of new establishments; many inmates would bekept longer in their rooms each day and work,education and recreation would be curtailed, withattendant risks to good order and discipline.49. If it were decided to switch resources to safe-guard police and fire current expenditure, the prisonscapital programme could be further reduced by amounts of  1-5 million in 1977-78,  3-0 million in 1978-79 and  3-3 million in 1979-80, bydeferring beyond the period a planned young offenders institution. Unless there were a fall ininmate population, young offenders would then haveto be confined in adult prisons, worsening theconditions described above.General protective servicespolice50. The formula reductions would require thepresent police strength, which already exceeds the1975-76 forecast of 11,825 assumed in Cmnd. 5879,to be reduced by 900 to a figure of 15 per cent belowauthorised establishments by 1979-80; legislation would be necessary. Civilian strengths would beheld at their current level of 4,155. Capitalexpenditure reductions would defer starts on somesubstantial projects, some of which have alreadybeen deferred as a result of previous expenditure cuts; this would mean continuing to accept, par-ticularly in Glasgow, conditions which are far fromsatisfactory.51. If it were decided to switch resources tosafeguard police and fire current expenditure, policestrength could be allowed to rise to 12,400, and civilians to 4,800, in 1979-80; but in practice forces would probably prefer to recruit uniformed officersif they could get them. The consequent additions to the expenditure would be  10 million,  3-0 mil-lion,  6-0 million and  7-3 million in the last fouryears respectively of the period. The police capital programme could be further reduced by  0-7 mil-lion,  1-5 million,  2-4 million and  3-8 million in the last four years respectively, to help restore the reduction in current expenditure, but because ofthe need to maintain expenditure on essential equip-ment, this would mean deferring beyond the survey period all starts on new buildings other than veryminor projects.fire services52. The formula provision would require areduction by 1979-80 of nearly 400 in the number of full-time firemen, from the present level of 3,850.There would be a serious reduction in fire cover andin fire prevention work; legislation would probablybe needed.53. If it were decided to switch resources to safe-guard police and fire current expenditure, it wouldbe possible to avoid a reduction in the number offiremen by adding back amounts of  0-1 million, 0-5 million,  1-3 million and  1-5 million in Ihelast four years respectively of the period. At thesame time, fire capital expenditure would have to befurther reduced by amounts of  0-4 million, 0-5 million,  1-9 million and  1-7 million in thefour years respectively; this would mean deferringthe proposed headquarters buildings for two brigadesand other projects.

The expenditure limits imply that after 1976-77there would be a fall in total expenditure on educa-tion. It has not proved practicable to comply withthe expenditure limits in later years without pro-ducing excess savings in 1977-78.2. It would fall to local authorities to make manyof the changes. They would involve substantial changes in Government policy on both the scope and standard of the education service. On the pro-posed disposition of the resources available, thefollowing pledges made by the Government wouldhave to be modified or abandoned:Nursery education It would not be possible togo on expanding provision for the under-fives after1976-77.Class sizes Progress towards meeting the com-commitment to reduce the size of all classes in primary and secondary schools to less than 30 would be stopped.Higher education On the basis of the latest estimates of potential demand, admissions to higher education would have to be deliberatelyrestricted up to 4 per cent below the estimated number of qualified applicants by 1981. To this extent the Robbins principle, that higher educa-tion courses should be available to all who are qualified to pursue them and who wish to do so,would not be fully met.Non-advanced further education There wouldbe no scope for any expansion in this area suchas increasing the proportion of young people onday-release courses.Open University The intake of new studentswould ha\T to be severely limited.On the other hand, it would be possible within theprescribed allocations to provide for a special short-term programme of mainly minor works to be started in 1976-77 to facilitate comprehensivesecondary reorganisation (paragraph 13).3.

Under-fives5. Local authorities would have to be asked tohold the number of under-fives in nursery andprimary schools constant at the planned 1976-77level of 450,000. This would allow some increase inthe proportion of young children receiving nursery education (at present 43 per cent of four-year oldsand 5 per cent of three-year olds), since the size ofthose age-groups is diminishing. But it would mean that the Government^ present aim of providingeducation for 90 per cent of four-year olds and50 per cent of three-year olds by 1981 would beunattainable. A building programme of  9 millionstarts for 1976-77 and a further  11 million over thefollowing three years, compared with  72 million on the basis of Cmnd. 5879, would be allocated tothe areas of greatest need to be used to provide fully equipped nursery buildings in place of existing often inadequate and ill-suited accommodation for under-fives in primary schools.Primary and secondary schools6. It is assumed that the schools will continue toeducate all children now in attendance or presented for admission, while they are of statutory school age and as long as they wish to stay on at schoolbeyond the age of 16.recurrent expenditure. Teacher numbers would rise to 463,000 in1977-78, but local education authorities would haveto be asked to hold numbers at that level in thefollowing two years. This would be a reduction of16,000 in 1978-79 and 20,000 in 1979-80 below thenumbers consistent with the policy, which was announced in March, of a teacher force of480-490,000 in 1981. This smaller teacher force would be sufficient to maintain in later years theaverage pupil: teacher ratios (PTR) of the academicyear 1975-76 namely:Under-fives...... 26&apos;6:1Primary....... 23-3:1Secondary to 16..... 18-2:1Secondary over 16..... 9-5:during the Survey period the number of primaryschool teachers would fall gradually with the numberof primary pupils; but there would be an increase inthe number of secondary school teachers. these changes could be achieved by the normal wastageprocess. Additionally the teacher numbers assumedwould allow for the phased introduction of inductiontraining for newly-qualified teachers from 1976-77,and for some continuing growth in in-service training. The Departments view is that the implementation of these programmes, which havealready been deferred once, commands a higher priority than the alternative of some further improvement in PTR beyond the ratios of 1975-76.8. Measures are already in hand to reduce thenumber of students undertaking teacher training, but because of the time lags involved and the need to moderate the rundown of the colleges of educationso as to maintain a viable teacher training system,the further restrictions imposed on teacher numberswould result in a substantial excess of qualifiedteachers over employment opportunities. The un-certainties about future wastage rates, and to an increasing extent the result of integrating teacher training with other higher education courses, makeforecasting particularly difficult. But best estimatesindicate that the potential excess supply of peoplequalified as teachers in September each year would rise from about 7,500 in 1976 to 22,500 in 1979.9. The estimates for teachers&apos; salaries also take account of the higher expenditure which wouldresult from an increase in the average age andlevel of qualifications of the teaching force.10. Local authorities would have to be asked to limit non-teaching unit costs in schools to a growth of 2 per cent above the assumed 1975-76 level in1976-77 with annual rises of 1^ per cent in the threefollowing years. This compares with the 1J per centgrowth rate allowed for in the 1975-76 RSG settle-ment (which however may have been implemented tosome extent by deferment of expenditure on itemssuch as maintenance) and rates of over 3 per cent for the later years in Cmnd. 5879. This growth inunit costs is mainly attributable to bringing intouse new buildings, to changing teaching methods andto the growing sophistication of new eqipment. Inaddition, as the number of children, in primary schools will be contracting, the overhead cost perpupil will necessarily increase. Local authoritieshave consistently maintained that an annual increasein non-teaching costs is inescapable and that a growth rate of at least 4 per cent is needed.11. The Governments policy on direct grantschools, announced earlier this year, involves the phasing-out of those schools. Their last direct grant
intake will be in September 1975. The expenditureconsequences of this policy will not be known untilevery school has made a decision about its future. On the basis of present knowledge, it isexpected that, although there will be a transfer of resources between different categories of expenditure,there will be no change in total expenditure.capital expenditure12. Basic needs building programmes would continue at the level required for the growth of secondary school pupil numbers and for populationshift at both primary and secondary levels. (the traditional formula by which the starts values ofthese programmes was calculated is being reviewed;meanwhile the starts values calculated for Cmnd.5879 have been maintained for the present Survey.)There is provision for improvement and replacementprogrammes of  20 million starts in 1976-77 and 15 million in each of the three following years.These limited programmes would largely be requiredto provide effective and economical management ofthe basic needs programmes but there should be some residual sums available for replacementprojects. The small size of these sums would bearespecially harshly on urban areas where there is often little occasion for basic needs building but where there are many old schools. The sub-standardaccommodation in these old schools would have toremain in use for much longer than was envisaged inpreviously announced plans.13. A starts programme of mainly minor workstotalling  25 million has been announced for1976-77 only, for a Special Programme to AssistReorganisation (SPAR). About two-thirds of theexpenditure will fall in 1976-77 and the rest in1977-78. The Governmenfs policy on comprehensive-sive secondary reorganisation cannot be sensiblyachieved by some local authorities unless they under-take certain limited building projects, and the SPARprogramme is a means whereby these difficulties in implementing the Governmenfs policy can beremoved. This programme will not be distributed among authorities in the usual way; instead, bids willhave been invited from authorities for the purposespecified and the Department will allocate resources in response to those bids within the available total.Special schools14. Recent trends in numbers justify a reductionin the forecast of pupils compared with Cmnd.5879 which leads to reductions in the expenditure forecasts up to  13-4 million by 1978-79. Staffingstandards and non-teaching costs in special schoolsare treated in the same way as in primary and secondary schools. There is provision for building programme starts of  10 million in 1976-77 and 7 million in each of the three following years.These amounts are less than one-quarter of thecorresponding provision in Cmnd. 5879. Thisreflects the DES view of the educational prioritiesat a time of restraint but the result would be that many children who ought to be in special schoolswould remain in ordinary schools where their special needs cannot be fully met and where their presence is sometimes positively disruptive. nor would it be possible to provide replacementaccommodation for those handicapped children whoare at present taught in unsatisfactory buildings.School milk15. The expenditure forecasts assume that a recommendation of the Committee on CateringArrangements in Schools will be adopted. school milk would continue to be provided free of charge to children aged 7-11 on grounds of health or ifthey were attending a special school but in other cases local authorities would be allowed to sellmilk on the same footing as the sale of refresh-ments and beverages other than a school dinner,i.e. provision and prices would be at the discretion of the authority instead of their having to charge the full cost as at present. Ministers collectivelyhave not yet taken any decision on this issue.School meals16. Increases are proposed in the present 15pcharge for school meals of 5p in September 1976,5p in September 1977, 8p in September 1978 andlOp in September 1979. These are cash figures;on present assumptions about inflation they wouldmean a reduction from 63 per cent to 35 per centin the proportion of the cost which is subsidised.(Cmnd. 5879 assumed annual increases sufficientto keep the proportion constant). When the charge was raised, an adjustment would be made to theincome scales used for assessing eligibility for freeschool meals to alleviate any hardship which might result. This proposal would produce savings ofsome  60 million in 1979-80. The DES considerthat it would be less damaging educationally thanfurther reducing expenditure on teaching and other
costs. If, for any reason, the proposals were withdrawn, other expenditure reductions would be needed to meet the Survey&apos;s requirements.Non-advanced further education17. The forecasts of student demand for further education (below degree level) have been substan-tially increased in the light of the more rapid growth revealed by recent statistics. The Survey&apos;sconstraints do not leave room for a comparableincrease in expenditure and the forecasts thereforemean that by 1981-82 it will be possible to provideonly for 96 per cent of the revised forecast of student demand. If this forecast is correct it means that by the autumn of 1979 17,000 potential non-advanced students are unlikely to find places in the colleges.18. Even to provide for the reduced studentnumbers, it would be necessary to require localauthorities to adopt severe policies on staffing andon the building programmes. The total numberof academic staff in non-advanced further educa-tion would have to be held at the level for 1976-77during the following three years. This would resultin a change in the staff: student ratio from 1:10-8in 1975-76 to 1:11-9 in 1979-80. Non-teachingunit costs would also have to be limited to a rise of 2 per cent in 1976-77 and by only 1  per cent a year in 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80 for thesame reasons as those recorded in paragraph 10.The building programme starts would have to be substantially less than would be required to provide in full for the growth of student numbers. existing buildings would have to be used as much as 10per cent more intensively, with an inevitable declinein standards.19. The expenditure projections also include theprovision of  1 million in both 1976-77 and1977-78 to continue the special programme whichis being mounted this year to counter adultilliteracy.Higher education20. At the time of the 1974 Survey it was estimatedthat to maintain the Robbins principle, that courses of higher education should be available to all thosewho are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wish to do so, provisionfor 700,000 full-time and sandwich students inGreat Britain in 1981 would be required. On thebasis of later statistical information, however, it72was estimated in Cmnd. 5879 that the Robbinsprinciple would be maintained by provision for640,000 students in 1981. This planning figure hasnow been provisionally reduced further to 625,000.The present expenditure projections would allow for 600,000 students in 1981, some 96 per cent of the current forecast of qualified demand. Onthe basis of the planning figure of 625,000, theexpenditure forecast would make it necessary to restrict the number of admissions to higher education by up to 15,000 in autumn 1979.21. As in the non-advanced further educationsector, a freeze on academic staff numbers at the1976-77 levels would be required. The resultantchanges in the staff: student ratio would be:	1975-76	1979-80Universities	1: 8-4	1:9-4Advanced FE   .	1:7-3	1:9-2The provision for non-teaching unit costs is thesame as in the non-advanced sector, i.e. a rise in1976-77 by 2 per cent and by a further \\ per centin each of the following years. Substantial reduc-tions would be required in the provision of grants for university equipment, to a level at which no improvement in standards is likely to be possible.Computer Board expenditure would be significantly reduced but would allow for necessary replacementand running costs.22. The building programme for higher educationwould be minimal and mainly confined to projectsneeded to ensure the full use of vacant science places and the maximum use of the former Colleges ofEducation. The intensity of use of premises wouldhave to be increased by about 3 per cent whichshould be possible without an unacceptable declinein standards. Allowance has been made for 8 million starts on student residence projects in1976-77, but none thereafter. The implication isthat higher education institutions would need to admit an increasing proportion of home-basedstudents if they are to avoid adding unduly to thehousing problems in certain areas. The provisionnecessary to meet the planned expansion of pre-clinical medical places has been included in full, butexpenditure on the UGC&apos;s share of the clinical build-ing programme has been reduced in accordance withthe formula.SECRET
23. The expenditure forecasts would require the open University to restrict intakes from at least20,000 in 1977 to 13,500 in 1978 and about 7,000 in1979 and 1980. The number of new applicants nowexceeds 50,000 each year, and the former studentsright to return would pre-empt some of the limitedplaces available.24. The reduction in teacher training numbers men-tioned in paragraph 8 is being achieved through asubstantial reorganisation of the colleges of educa-tion. This inevitably means that expenditure fore-casts in this area will be subject to considerable uncertainty. The estimates include provision for thepayment of compensation, on terms in accordancewith the Crombie Code, to redundant staff.Higher and further education fees25. The Department is committed to annual increases in the levels of tuition fees for universities and further education to maintain their values in real terms. The present proposals would require further increases from 1977-78 leading to a net reduction in public expenditure of  22J million in 1979-80.They imply a considerable reduction in the existingsubstantial subsidies for students well able to pay their own fees, particularly overseas students fromdeveloped and oil-producing countries. (Policy inthis area is at present under review.)Libraries26. The figures for the Survey assumed that theBloomsbury site would continue to be used for theBritish Library. However a decision has now beentaken in favour of an alternative site at Euston. Itshould be possible to cover the cost of acquisitionwithin the sub-programme provided the Bloomsbuiysite is sold. Provision of  2-1 million is included for initial construction work on a first phase in1979-80 but the actual starting date is subject todetermination in the light of the economic conditions prevailing nearer the time.27. A \\ per cent a year growth rate for the1975-76 level of expenditure has been allowed for local authority libraries current expenditure. In line with this projection, it is assumed that there willbe substantial cuts in local authorities&apos; capitalexpenditure, to only  2 million in 1979-80. (that expenditure forms part of the locally-determinedsector which is managed by DOE.)SCOTLAND (excluding University Grants Com-mittee expenditure on universities)28. The amounts available for expenditure in eachyear, excluding grants to persons and North Sea oilinfrastructure expenditure, are:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80551-8	531-7	507-3	504-329. The following paragraphs describe the effect of applying the Survey formula to each sector of theprogramme. While therefore they are indicative ofthe possible consequences of the formula reductionthey do not necessarily reflect the way in whichScottish Ministers would actually decide to applyresources at this level. In some sectors, e.g. schoolmeal charges, such decisions would clearly have tobe co-ordinated with those taken in England andWales.30. The following are forecasts of the numbers of pupils and students for whom the programmesdescribed below would provide:Thousands	1975	1976	1977	1978	1979	-76	-77	-78	-79	-80Schools:					Under-fives	28	37	44	48	52Other primary  .	611	598	583	564	542Secondary					To age 16	333	337	340	337	334Over 16	60	70	&apos;   72	75	77Further  and   Higher					Education	90	93	96	98	10131.

The building programme would continue toprovide new accommodation for under-fives but ata lower rate of progress, from the second half of
1976-77, than that envisaged in Cmnd. 5879. Thenumber of places available (in addition to places inprimary classes) by 1980 would be about 43,000and if the programme was then continued at the reduced 1979-80 rate the target of 59,000 placeswould be reached by 1985-86, some three yearslater than was envisaged in Cmnd. 5879.33. The amount provided for recurrent expenditure would allow an expansion of teacher numbers but ata slower rate than previously envisaged. This would lead to a pupil-teacher ratio of 32-2:1 in 1979-80compared with a ratio of 29 - 0:1 envisaged in Cmnd.5879 (throughout the period up to 1978-79).Primary, secondary and special schoolscapital expenditure34. The amount provided would meet the basicneed for addititional school places throughout theperiod but there would be only limited scope for theimprovement of old primary and secondary schools.It would not be possible to provide in 1976-77 forany of the starts programme for improvement of 5-2 million already provisionally announced forthat year, but it would be possible to maintain theCmnd. 5879 starts programme for the subsequent years, viz.  6-3 million in 1977-78 and  7-3 million in 1978-79; and to provide for  3-8 million in1979-80. The starts programme for special schoolswould be  3-0 million from 1976-77 onwards.recurrent expenditure35. It would be possible for local authorities toprovide sufficient teachers in 1975-76 and 1976-77either to meet or to make progress towards the staffing standards envisaged in Cmnd. 5879, but inthe years 1977-78 to 1979-80 this would not bepossible. By 1979-80 there would be provision forsome 2,400 fewer primary teachers and for some,700 fewer secondary teachers than required underCmnd. 5879 giving pupil-teacher ratios of 25 -1:1and 16-7:1 respectively instead of 22-9:1 and15-0:1. The expenditure provision would not permit any growth in non-teaching unit costsbetween 1975-76 and 1976-77. In the subsequent years to 1979-80 there would need to be a net reduction in these costs of about 1 per cent a year.School milk and meals36. The amount provided assumes no change in theCmnd. 5879 policies on school milk and meal charges,i.e. an increase in the charge in September 1976,1977 and 1978 sufficient to maintain broadly theproportion of the total cost met by subsidy. If,however, the DES proposals for increasing thecharge for meals instead of cutting gross expenditure were accepted over the whole country there would besavings in Scotland as follows:  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-801-6	2-2	3-6	4-9Non-advanced	further	education	37.   The capital expenditure provision would enable   Iexpected commitments in respect of non-advanced   1student numbers to be met, though with some difficulty, involving a greater intensity of use of   1accommodation and in some cases sub-standardfacilities.38. The provision for recurrent expenditure would meet the present estimate of demand and allow foran increase in the number of non-advanced studentsfrom 56,000 in 1975-76 to 64,000 in 1979-80 butonly with a substantial stiffening of staff/studentratios. The overall average would worsen from about 1:11-8 to about 1:14-0. Although it isdesirable that some stiffening of this ratio shouldtake place it is the view of SED that it must be doubtful whether authorities (including localauthorities) can realistically be expected to move soquickly. So far as non-teaching costs are concerned the same pattern would have to be followed as forschools (paragraph 35).Higher education39. The amount allocated for capital expenditure would provide for about 36,000 places by 1979-80compared with an estimated requirement of about37,000 places. This might involve some over-crowding and possible refusal of admission toqualified applicants.40. The recurrent expenditure provision would allow the overall average staff /student, ratio to bemaintained owing to the fall in the requirement forteacher training. But this would not be true of thecentral institutions (non-teacher training) in this sector. With increasing student numbers in their case their staff: student ratio would have to declinefrom 1:9-0 in 1975-76 to about 1:11-2 in 1979-80;alternatively, and more realistically in SED&apos;s view,the intake might be restricted by about 4 per cent(500 places) to achieve a ratio of 1:10-0.
Social and recreational education41. The progressive reduction in the programmecompared with that in Cmnd. 5879 would permitonly a limited number of major projects. authorities would have increasing difficulty in maintainingI standards and the previously intended expansion inthe numbers of qualified youth and communityworkers would have to be abandoned.Local authority libraries42. The programme would permit starts on alimited number of projects of high priority only.The service could be maintained but on a progres-sively declining standard of provision involving lowerstaff numbers and restricted expenditure on books.RESEARCH COUNCILS ETC43. This is a block budget (the &quot; Science Budget &quot;)and is allocated by the Secretary of State for education and Science, on advice received from theAdvisory Board for the Research Councils, to thefive Research Councils (Agricultural, Medical,Natural Environment, Science and Social Science),to the British Museum (Natural History), and to agrant-in-aid to the Royal Society for scientificpurposes. The allocation for 1975-76 is broken down as follows:	  million	1975-76Agricultural Research Council	13-1Medical Research Council	28-8Natural Environmental Research Council	19-2Science Research Council	96-4Social Science Research Council	8-7Natural History Museum*	2-royal Society.....	1-7Total.....	170-8* Includes provision for major building.44. The purpose of the research financed fromthe Science Budget is to develop the sciences assuch, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education. It covers a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from investiga-tion of human and animal health and behaviourthrough the causes of, and cures for pollution, tothe mapping of the earth, sea and sky and the investigation of the laws of physical matter.Research Councils support these activities partly by carrying out research in their own establish-ments and units, partly by making grants touniversity departments, providing central facilitiesfor university research workers, and providingsupport grants for postgraduate students.45. The 1976-77 figure, while representing a cut of  1-5 million on the level implied for that yearby Cmnd. 5879, is 2-5 per cent higher than thefigure for the current year ( 170-8 million) andthis level is maintained in 1977-78. But for thelast two years of the Survey period the figures show a decline back to the level of expenditurein the current year. This reflects the science budget contribution to the Departments overallexpenditure reductions compared with Cmnd. 5879.ARTS46. In the period up to 1978 the provision for current expenditure by the national museums and galleries would permit the continuation of presentactivities, the manning of building extensions due for completion, the improvement of security and,in England, the encouragement of further liaison with non-national institutions on conservation. But,in Scotland and Wales, the reductions required inthe two final years could be achieved only by man-power cuts or by closing the institutions for atleast one day each week, since the necessaryresources to avoid this could only be found by making undesirable cuts in other programmes.47. The capital provision for national museums and galleries should enable the present plannedprojects in England to be carried through, but therewould be no scope for new projects. In Scotlandand Wales, however, it would preclude even the start of planned projects.48. No provision is made for any additional expenditure on the acquisition, housing and care ofworks of art or other objects arising from theoperation of the Wealth Tax.49. Provision for current expenditure on the Arts,the major part of which goes to the Arts Council,would enable the level of activity of existing clientsto be maintained. It would also be sufficient to finance the occupation and running of the new national Theatre and the setting up of a PublicLending Right scheme during 1976-77 and 1977-78.But the reduced resources for 1978-79 and 1979-80would be inadequate for these purposes and for payments to authors under the Public Lending
Right scheme. It is estimated that an additional 5 million in each year would be required to meet these obligations. The alternative would be to close the new National Theatre and to abandon thePublic Lending Right scheme.50. The level of capital expenditure provided forthe last two years for the Arts Council and otherArts would mean that much less could be spentby the Arts Council and the British Film Instituteon housing the arts and housing the cinema.51. Cmnd. 5879 assumed that the National Theatrewould have been completed in 1975-76. Up-to-date estimates of the cost of completion and ofits timing were not available at the base date forthe Survey, and so are excluded from the minimumtables. It is now clear that additional provision is required of  1-2 million in 1975-76,  0-8 million in 1976-77 and  0-2 million in 1977-78. This isan inescapable commitment but it has not beenpossible to find offsetting savings within the Educa-tion, Libraries, Science and Arts programmes.

The provision for total expenditure on the health and personal social services would lead tothe following growth rates on the previous year:England     Scotland(Per cent)Wales1975-761976-771977-781978-791979-80+4-1+0-2-1-5+01-4-5-4+0-4+0-3-1-1+0-3-f3-6-0-1-0-2-1-2+0-22. The National Health Service, for the first time since its creation in 1948, would be subject toabsolute reductions, and so also would the personal social Services. While the effect of the reductions on current expenditure could be mitigated to someextent by additional switches from capital, such a move would add in turn to the problems facing the nhs and would involve further postponement of major capital schemes, including some for ares which by any standards must be regarded at present as inadequately served. The morale of NHS staff,on whose contribution the service is vitally depen-dent, would be severely depressed, and this wouldaggravate the effect of the cuts themselves.Health Servicescurrent expenditure3. Expenditure on the family practitioner services,which has not been subjected to the formulareductions, would continue to grow at an average annual rate of around 3 per cent from 1976-77 to1979-80. The forecasts assume that family planningsupplies will continue to be prescribed anddispensed free of charge, that other prescription charges will remain at the flat rate of 20p an item,and that dental and ophthalmic charges will beincreased as costs rise. The Treasury considerthat in the present economic situation prescription charges for those not exempt should also be in-creased. A rise in the charge from 20p to 30p, forexample, would produce a net saving in expenditureof about  20 million.4. The allocation for running the hospital and community health services would fall by 0-1 percent in 1977-78 below the level for 1976-77(already reduced in the Budget statement), by 3 percent in 1978-79 and by a further 1 per cent in1979-80. The figures for 1978-79 and 1979-80would be below those for 1975-76. The major problem is how to reconcile such a reduction withan expanding need, in particular for the growing number of old people. It is estimated that therewill be an increase of 2 per cent a year over the
Survey period in the number of people aged 75and over, leading to a substantial increase in demand for services, while the lower birth-ratewill lead to only a small fall in demand. In ordermerely to maintain existing standards for a changingpopulation, and to allow for technological advance,the provision for hospitals is estimated to require a growth of around H per cent a year.5. It is clear that if reductions of the size envisagedwere applied to a service in which staff account for75 per cent of total expenditure, the growth of manpower planned for the Survey period wouldhave to be restricted. For example, there wouldhave to be a reduction of nearly 10 per cent inthe forecast for 1978-79 given in Cmnd. 5879.Applying this reduction across the board to procure-ment and staffing would mean 77,000 fewer health service workers than planned, of whom nearly4,000 would be doctors and 36,000 nurses. Com-paring the new forecast for 1978-79 with thepresent year, the fall in expenditure would be 0-per cent, requiring a reduction in present staff numbers of about 5,000. The NHS in some areas is already understaffed, wards are empty becauseof lack of nurses, and there is constant pressure to expand the number of doctors in some speciali-ties and in some parts of the country.6. Staff reductions of this order could be accom-accommodated only by drastically revising present policies.Standards in geriatric and psychiatric services areeven now regarded by the Health Departments asdangerously low. Any protection for these sectorscould come only from cutting still further the acute sector, where waiting-lists are already long,or reducing other services below a level whichthe Health Departments consider is alreadyinadequate. A number of small hospitals arealready being closed and it would be necessaryto close many more including some providingaccident and emergency services, because of thecost of 24 hours a day, seven days a week cover.The effect would vary in particular areas: in some places this could lead to a breakdown in public confidence in the NHS and in staff morale.capital expenditure. From the early 1960s up to 1972-73 and1973-74 there was a sharply rising investment inthe health services, involving a mixture of schemesof varying sizes and complexity. Expenditure in1975-76 will be some 17 per cent less than in1973-74. There will similarly be a reduction in1976-77 from the previous year&apos;s level, and thedecline would continue over the Survey period.Despite the investment of the last 12 years or so,in both new buildings and refurbishing, there remains a large historical legacy of old hospitalbuildings requiring replacement and many unful-filled plans for new facilities. These have long been awaited by the communities concerned, to cope with demand particularly from the elderly,whose numbers are growing, from the mentally illand from the mentally handicapped.8. The limitation of funds experienced during thepast two years, and projected for 1976-77, hasalready led to the postponing of a substantial pro-portion of the planned major hospital projects. InEngland, the allocations now envisaged for subse-quent years would mean a further severe limitation on major schemes and a total moratorium may haveto be considered. Furthermore over the next fiveyears 222 health centres would have to be dropped from forward plans. In Scotland and Wales theeffect would be to slow down markedly the imple-mentation of health policies which depend on theprovision of new or upgraded buildings. In all three countries a minimum provision for small schemes would be required to sustain essential minor works and to replace plant and equipment but some main-tenance work and the introduction of more adequatefire precautions would be delayed.Personal social servicescurrent expenditure. Over the last few years planned growth incurrent expenditure on the personal social serviceshas been between 7 and 8 per cent a year. the forecast for 1975-76 represented a growth on theprevious year of some 6 per cent, and this was intended to cover only the increase due to inescap-able commitments. The reductions now proposed would provide growth between 1976-77 and 1979-80of around 2 per cent a year. Statutory duties forexample, under the Children and Young persons act, 1969, and the Chronically Sick and disabled persons Act, 1970 are expected to lead to increasedrequirements. Law and Order expenditure on com-munity homes, previously a Home Office responsi-bility, was transferred to local authorities in 1973:there is a 5 per cent increase in juvenile crime eachyear. A greater number of children are now takeninto care.  Local authorities will be unable to rely
on further assistance from the voluntary sector whichis itself in financial difficulty. It follows that verydifficult decisions would have to be made to achieveabsolute cuts in some other services where demand will be affected by the increasing number of old people and by general social and economic pressures.10. Among the problems that might face localauthorities would be:(i) The need for completed buildings to be leftunused;(ii) An increase in the existing very high caseloads on social workers;(iii) The curtailment of some services for prioritycategories (e.g. the very elderly and theseverely handicapped living alone). this could involve, for instance, much strictercriteria for the availability of home helps, anda lower provision of aids and adaptations of housing for the disabled.capital expenditure11. The allocation in 1975-76 is  114 million. the reductions proposed would become increasinglysevere, ending in 1978-79 and 1979-80 at only littlemore than one-third of the present allocation. Therewould be a most serious decline in the number ofbuilding projects commenced as an essential part ofthe strategy of moving patients from hospital care to community care in the fields of mental illness,mental handicap and geriatrics. The development ofthis strategy is already giving concern because, facedwith the problems that exist in present circumstances in meeting the current expenditure consequences ofcapital schemes, local authorities are increasinglyreluctant to embark upon such projects. Neverthe-less, it would be possible to provide the essentialsecure accommodation required for child offenders.In Scotland, the final distribution of the available resources between capital and current expenditurein 1976-77 and later years depends upon planningdecisions still to be taken.Other health services and central and miscellaneousservices12. These two sub-programmes together covernearly 100 individual items, the largest of which relate to the Special Hospitals, Training, thePrescription Pricing Authority, Dental EstimatesBoard, Departmental administration, Research, and services for the Disabled. Apart from WelfareFoods, which is exempt under the ground rules, anda few other items which cannot be cut, each sub-programme as a whole is broadly to take its propor-tionate reduction. It might indeed be necessary to slow down by at least a year progress on completing the new special hospital at Park Lane, Liverpool.This in turn would mean a delay, of one or possiblytwo years, in starting the rebuilding of Broadmoor.Reductions in current expenditure for the SpecialHospitals would mean that recruitment of nursesfrom 1976-77 onwards would have to be reduced toa level which would make it difficult to commissionPark Lane on the extended timetable.

As the programme consists of current grants to persons the figures have not been subject to percen-tage reduction. This Section sets out, in conjunctionwith Table 12, the consequences of existing legisla-tion together with the results of decisions already taken. Apart from the new pensions scheme, nochange has been assumed in the structure of national insurance benefits. The programme includes newbenefits for the disabled. The position on child benefits is set out in paragraph 5-8 below. Thefigures have been calculated on economic assump-tions which take account of &quot; The Attack onInflation &quot;.2. The Government was committed to introducing the new pension scheme not later than April 1978and in 1977 if this proved possible. The provision in Cmnd. 5879 was for a 1978 start and it was announced in August that the start would be in 1978.Two changes forming part of the new pension scheme which were previously planned to take placein 1978 were postponed until 1979 with savings of 12 million in 1978-79 and  13 million in 1979-80.Table 12 takes account of those changes. In theWhite Paper on &quot;Better Pensions&quot; (Cmnd. 5713)the Government undertook that &quot; with the introduc-tion of the new scheme, the position of existingpensioners will be further reviewed in the light ofthe development of the economy &quot;. As in Cmnd.5879, no allowance has been made in the programme for the result of this review.Upratings3. Benefits were uprated in April 1975 and will beuprated again in November 1975. Between July1974 and November 1975 standard long-term bene-fits  will,  on  Survey  assumptions   about  pricemovements, have increased in real value by 2-7 percent and standard short-term benefits will have declined in real value by 0 - 3 per cent.4. No decision has yet been made about the dates of upratings after November 1975. The figures havebeen calculated on the assumption that theseupratings, other than of family allowances or childbenefit, take place at intervals of 12 months, themaximum allowed under the Act. In the view of theDepartment of Health and Social Security (DHSS)this may prove unrealistic over the next year or soeven if the rise in prices slows down markedlyduring that time as &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot;implies. The Department points out that there willhave been two upratings this year after intervals of1\ and 8 months and that the rise in prices will notnecessarily slow down soon enough to allow the november uprating, which may not prove verygenerous in relation to the level of prices at that time,to last a full year. The figures have been calculated on the further assumption in accordance with statu-tory provision, that the long-term benefits will beincreased in line with the movement of earnings,except in November 1976 when the movement ofprices over the determining period is more favour-able, and that the short-term benefits will beincreased in line with the movement of prices. Thescale rates of supplementary benefit are assumed,following normal practice, to be increased at eachuprating by the same cash amount as the correspond-ing national insurance rates.Family support5. It has been announced that the Child BenefitScheme will start in April 1977. This will be a tax-free cash benefit for each child, replacing notonly family allowances but also child tax allowances for children under 11 and a similar amount of the child tax allowance for children between 11 and 19.
It has also been announced that a benefit for thefirst child in one-parent families child&apos;s interimbenefit will start in April 1976; this is included inthe cost of family allowances in Table 12.6. No agreement was reached in 1974 on the rate atwhich child benefits would be introduced in 1977and it was recognised that the decision need not betaken until the Spring of 1976. In planning public expenditure, however, a sum was set aside on top of the cost of existing family support measures, andon the assumption that there would be no changein the value of the child tax allowances before1977. This corresponded to a weekly rate of  2-16per child. The Secretary of State reserved her position about the adequacy of this provision.7. The assumptions have in the event been falsifiedby the April 1975 Budget. The change in the taxrate increased the tax-saving value of child tax allowances, but reduced the after-tax value of family allowances. In net terms, this increased the valueof child support for the basic rate taxpayer by 9p forthe first child and 4p for other children, at a cost of 45 million. The DHSS and the Treasury have notbeen able to agree on the appropriate way of adjust-ing for this change. The DHSS consider that separately of  2-22 would now be needed to give the sameextra benefit in cash terms to an average family,which has just over two children, as  2-16 before theBudget. However, on the economic assumptionsused in this year&apos;s Survey, even a rate of  2-16 couldnot be financed out of the money earmarked by theChancellor; and the real value of that rate wouldbe somewhat higher than was envisaged last year. separately of  2-16 would give higher provision in real terms to the average two-child family; and a cashincrease to families with up to seven children, com-pared with what they will receive in 1976. Tworates have therefore been costed:  2-16 and  2-22.The following table shows the net Exchequer costof child support before and after the introductionof child benefits on the assumption that there is nochange in present child tax allowances, basic rate ofof tax, or family allowances before 1977. Bothcostings include savings of about  40 million from1977-78 on two main scores. First, child benefit will accrue from the birth of the child not, like childtax allowances, for the whole tax year in which the child is born. Secondly, those drawing sickness benefit or similar benefits will lose part of the additions for children which are at present tax-free.GB   million   Net Exchequer cost1975 Survey prices		Child				benefit		1974-75	1975-76 1976-77	rate in	1977-78 1978-79 1979-80			1977-78		1,445	1,390     1,270	 2-16	1,255	1,190     1,125		 2-22	1,285	1,220     1,150These figures include the cost in revenue forgone of tax relief through child tax allowances. On theintroduction of child benefits, about  630 million of this relief will be converted to a cash benefit andwill rank as public expenditure. Table 12 does not include this revenue cost, but only the cost of con-tinuing family allowances in the absence of childbenefit. The extra cost of the child benefit scheme,over the cost of family allowances and child tax allowances will need to be accommodated in the contingency Reserve.8. Although the costs in table above and inTable 12 relate to Great Britain alone the childbenefit arrangements will of course extend to northern Ireland as well. As for Great Britain,the Northern Ireland Social Security figures inTable 15 include only the cost of family allowances.The extra cost of Child Benefit in Northern Ireland,over the cost of family allowances and child tax allowances, will be small but will also need to be accomodated in the contingency reserve.The real improvement of benefits9. The following table shows the broad conse-quences for their real value of uprating benefits,other than family allowances or child benefit, as described in paragraph 4. The base line taken isthe average rates of benefits in force in 1975-76,and the figures reflect the Survey assumptions aboutthe movement of earnings and prices.  million 1975 Survey prices1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80Long-term benefits	367	756	879	1,094Short-term benefits	99	175	160	160Other benefits	&apos;     -3&apos;	-6	-8	-10Total	463	925	1,031	1,244
Over the Survey period standard long-term benefitswill improve in real terms by about 4  per cent a year on average; and standard short-term benefitsby about 2\ per cent a year on average. Thegrowth is fastest in the earlier years of the period.10. A significant part of this real terms improve-ment arises because in accordance with existing policy, upratings are assumed in the table to bebased on known movements of earnings or pricesover a past period &quot; the historical method&quot;.Whilst the pace of inflation has been quickening,upratings have reflected lower (past) rates of increase in earnings or prices than were currently being experienced. Conversely, during the rest ofthe Survey period when inflation is assumed tobe slowing down, upratings in line with earningswill give larger real increases in long-term benefitsthan the current rate of real earnings increase.Even upratings in line with prices will lead to realimprovements in the value of benefits becausethe past increase of prices which determines them will be higher than the current price increaseeroding real values between upratings. This largelyexplains why the savings shown in paragraph 15 (a)are lower than the cost of the improvements in long-term benefits shown above.11. The improvement of provision set out in the table in paragraph 9 is the cost, on Surveyassumptions, of existing commitments. It con-trasts with the potential decline in the total valueof family support, on illustrative assumptions aboutthe future of family support, as shown in the table in paragraph 7.Staffing12. Between April 1976 and April 1977 there willbe a net increase of 4,150 in the number of staff engaged on social security work. But by April1980 the net increase compared with April 1976is expected to fall to about 1,000. These overallfigures reflect three factors:	Change	over April 1976	April 1977	April 1980Higher unemployment	4-2,000	+480New schemes and benefits .	+2.750	4-2,940Other benefits .	-600	-2,380	4,150	1,000Temporary staff savings would arise to the extent that starting dates for the new schemes or benefitswere deferred; the most significant savings would come from the deferment of child benefit (withsavings in the first year of about  5  million).EL  POLICY OPTIONS13. What follows sets out possible means of effecting savings in the social security programme.The inclusion of an option does not imply anyview about its political acceptability. The follow-ing descriptions are very broad and do not attemptto set out the suggestions in sufficient detail toenable final decisions to be made. The costcalculations do in general take account of associatedchanges needed to maintain coherence in thesystem of benefit provision, but do not take accountof changes which might be needed to make the basic proposals more palatable. To this extent the maximum figures of possible savings whichare given might not be realised. Some options arealternative to, or overlap with, others so thatadoption of more than one option might not realise the total of the savings shown.Uprating benefits14. The following table gives estimates of the savings that might be made on uprating policy.The savings estimates depend on the economicassumptions adopted for the Survey which imply that for a year prices would rise appreciably faster than earnings, after which real earnings would riseby about 2f per cent a year over the rest of the survey period. If real earnings rose more slowlythan this, the cost of the programme would be automatically reduced, and so would the savings from uprating in line with prices. If real earningsrose faster, the cost of the programme would beincreased and so would the saving from priceuprating. The options would not produce anysavings until the 1976 uprating, which is assumed to be in November, but would be cumulative there-after.15. Options (a) and (b) would require amendmentof the Act which, since 1974, has required long-term national insurance benefits to be upratedin fine with earnings except where prices risefaster.

The savings are cal-culated on the assumptions that(i) on the first occasion (Novem-ber 1976) the uprating wouldin addition cover any short-fall in the November 1975rates through use of the his-torical method since July 1974(see paragraph 10) on the survey assumption this seems likely to affect short-term benefits only; and(ii) despite the impossibility offorecasting correctly themovement of earnings and prices for several monthsahead, no margin would beadded to the forecast toensure that the uprating atleast matched the movementof earnings or prices (as was done in the past for pricesupratings when the forecastmethod was used).51    214    432-     26    107    219-     1253    106231    558    508    519Raising pension age16. Amendment of the Act would be needed. Theestimates of savings given below assume that raising the pension age would need to be done graduallyafter a period of notice, so that raising the ageby one year would be the most that could beachieved by 1978-79.   This would in turn mean that a further increase in pension age could notbe achieved until after the Survey period. If theage for women could be raised at one stroke to65 (to start, say, in April 1978), the savings wouldbe  19 million in 1978-79 and  56 million in1979-80. After five years the savings would reach 236 million. The figures make no allowance foran increase in the rates of pension to compensate for the loss of the increments which people can at present earn by deferring retirement.  million 1975 Survey prices1978-79    1979-80Increasing pension age from 65 to 66for men and from 60 to 61 forwomen.....Ill 228From 60 to 61 for women 19 39Earnings rule17. Revoking the provision in the last upratingAct which increased the earnings rule limit for retirement pensioners to  35 with effect from April1976 and  50 with effect from April 1977. TheGovernment was twice defeated in the commons on an amendment to raise the earnings limit from 13 to  20 in 1975-76 and to the amounts shown above in later years. It is estimated, assuming thatthe present  20 would be raised in line with themovement of average earnings over the survey period, that savings of  59 million would be effected in 1976-77,  106 million in 1977-78,  74 million in 1978-79, and  58 million in 1979-80. the savings would be large in the early years becausethe projected increases required by the Act aregreater than the movement of earnings. The Actmakes no provision for adjustment after 1977-78so that the savings thereafter would steadily declinein real terms.Child benefit scheme18. The Government is committed to introducing the scheme in April 1977. Postponing the start ofthe scheme for one year to April 1978 would yieldsavings in 1977-78 of about  115 million at therate of  2-16 or  145 million at the rate of  2-22(assuming the continuation of child interim benefit and no increase of family allowances or child tax allowances before the new scheme starts).
Short-term national insurance benefits19. Main legislation would be needed for (a) or(c) below. The estimates of savings quoted assume that the changes are made in time to give a full year&apos;s saving in 1978-79.(a) Removing entitlement to flat-rate unemploy-ment or sickness benefit for the first sixrather than for the first three days of theperiod of interruption of employment. (Sofar as sickness benefit is concerned thiswould place us in breach of an I.L.O. Con-vention.)   Saving  60 million.(b) Removing entitlement for flat-rate unemploy-ment benefit for the first six days of any period of suspension (lay-off). Saving  19million.(c) Restricting   entitlement   to   unemploymentbenefit for those receiving substantialoccupational pension. Many such pensionersclaim unemployment benefit when notwanting work. Proof sufficient to disallowbenefit is, however, hard to get. Govern-ments of both parties have tried to restrictbenefit to those with modest pensions but have had to withdraw the proposals. Saving 17 million.Supplementary benefit for students20. Removing, or very greatly reducing, the entitle-ment of students to supplementary benefit duringvacations could save up to  19 million in 1978-79on present projections of increasing claims fromstudents. This subject is already under urgent examination: officials have been instructed to reportby the beginning of September.Deferment of invalid care allowance and non-contributory invalidity pension for housewives21. The Governments publicly stated objective isto start the invalid care allowance during 1976-77and the non-contributory invalidity pension forhousewives during 1977-78. The first year cost ofthese proposals is respectively  2 million net and 18 million.Maternity grant22. Abolishing the maternity grant or making itspayment subject to a test of means. The maximumsavings from abolition, assuming no grant waspayable from April 1978 or earlier, would be  14million in 1978-79.

Inland Revenue and Customs and Exciseexpenditure consists almost entirely of wages and salaries and related administrative costs. Theestimates allow for an increase in Inland Revenuestaff to deal with the additional work resulting fromthe 1974 and 1975 Budget commitments, and fromthe growth both in the absolute number of individual and corporate taxpayers and from theincrease in the number of individuals who areliable to income tax at other than the basic rate.Cuts in estimates would be likely to result in an actual reduction of the amount of tax collected.2. The staff increase in Customs and Excise upto 1 April 1977 is due primarily to e.c. work andthe control of Value Added Tax both of whichare still evolving. Also additional staff areexpected to be required to control the increasingamount of traffic arising from North Sea oilactivities and from the continued development of east Coast Ports.other financial administration3. The Department for National Savings (DNS)items included in Table 13 reflect reductions whichthe Treasury believe can be sustained withoutsignificantly affecting the existing stock of national savings. The reductions arise from a 20 per cent reduction in the official support staff to the national savings Voluntary Movement ( 0-4 million in bothyears), together with increases in the minimum pur-chase amounts of Premium Savings Bonds and national Savings Certificates ( 0-3 million in bothyears).
4. This heading also covers the Exchequer andAudit Department. The reductions would requirestaff cuts in 1977-78 and 1978-79 which would seriously impair the departments capacity to carryout its statutory duties.5. The activities of the Bank of England are being examined in the light of the ground rules for the survey.Central management of the Civil service. Expenditure in this programme includes thegeneral management functions of the Civil service department (CSD), central civil service recruitment,training, and other services for civil service manage-ment, Royal Commissions, etc., Office of theParliamentary Counsel and the government hospitality Fund. The resources included inTable 13 will, after making all feasible economies,enable the departmental policies to be carried outin 1975-76 and 1976-77. In subsequent years after making such economies the resources will be inadequate to carry out existing or planned policies and some retrenchment of expenditure on general administration, central civil service recruitment andtraining will be necessary. In particular it may benecessary to curtail planned expansion of the CivilService College and it may not be possible to meet all additional commitments incurred for assistanceto certain Civil Service welfare organisations or ahigher rate of expenditure on Government hospitality-tality in 1977-78.Broadcasting (capital expenditure)7. Expenditure covers the capital requirements ofthe BBC Home Services and the IBA. although this expenditure was reduced in the 1974 Surveyadditional provision was subsequently made for the continuation of the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF)625-line colour transmitter building programme in1975-76 and 1976-77 at the rate previously envisaged. In 1977-78 and 1978-79 it was intendedto continue this programme at the original ratewithin the Cmnd. 5879 forecasts. The 1976-77expenditure was not covered by the cuts announced in the Chancellors Budget statement. The figures in Table 13 for the following years illustrate theeffect of the 1975 Survey formula. Without very severe cuts elsewhere in the broadcasting capital programmes, such a reduction would render itimpossible to meet the target of the UHF transmitterconstruction programme to obtain a coverage ofabout 98 per cent of the population by the end of1979. A delay would have the effect of deprivingsome people in the remoter areas of access to tele-vision at all, because by that time spare parts fortheir obsolete UHF 405-line sets will no longer beobtainable. The regional and political consequences of such deprivation are clear. As a result of the cuts made in the course of the 1974 Survey the bbc made deferments in the provision of additional production facilities in the regions, in plannedimprovements to radio transmissions, and therefurbishment of television and radio studios inLondon. The provision for these items would need to be still further reduced. In the case of the IBA,further reductions would have to be made in theprovisions for maintenance of the VHF (Very-HighFrequency) television transmitter network.Records, registrations and surveys8. This includes expenditure by several Govern-ment Departments (the Office of population censuses and Surveys, the General Register Office(Scotland), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, andother minor Departments) and some local authority expenditure. Provision is made under the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) for social surveys carried out as an allied service forGovernment Departments.9. The allocations for the Office of population censuses and Surveys (OPCS) and the GeneralRegister Office (Scotland) include a total of  1-million which is the estimated cost of the prepara-tory work for a 100 per cent census of the popula-tion in 1981. This masks the extent of the reduc-tions which these departments would be requiredto make under the ground rules. While the registration of births, marriages and deaths wouldbe unaffected and OPCS would be able to continuethe major ongoing social surveys, ultimately therewould be a severe reduction in the Departmentsability to carry out surveys for other Governmentdepartments.10. For Ordnance Survey, the main direct effect would be a reduction in manpower of about 450(10 per cent of present numbers) by 1979, involvingcessation of recruitment of draughtsmen and sur-veyors and a risk of redundancies. There wouldbe disturbance of career development, training, and
accountancy improvements; cumulative arrears inrevision of mapping; and an ending of the expansionof digital mapping as a future tool for planning,recording and administration.11. Local authority expenditure includes registra-tion of electors. The only way this could be contained within the levels set out in Table 13would be to increase the interval between prepara-tion of registers from 12 to perhaps 18 months.This would entail legislation and would probablybe unacceptable politically.Other services12. Included in this category is the capital invest-ment programme of Cable and Wireless Ltd. whichwas submitted to Ministers as part of the separatereview of nationalised industry investment.

This programme covers expenditure on office accommodation and on furnishing, maintenance and running costs of specialised accommodation for thehome civil service.2. With the size of the estate increasing, it is notpossible to do more than level off expenditure on maintenance and running costs, in the main byeconomising in the use of fuel. Expenditure onDepartmental administration is shown as dechningduring the last four years of the period, partly as theresult of cutbacks in capital expenditure. Expendi-ture on rents relates to accommodation alreadyleased and immediate demands for additional accommodation for extra staff, and is excepted fromformula cuts. The rent total at constant prices is however expected to decline during the last fouryears of the period as a result of dispersal of staff from London leased accommodation into Crownbuildings or less highly rented buildings outside london.3. Capital expenditure had been planned to rise toprovide Crown buildings for staff to be dispersedfrom London and to replace leased accommodation,but this expenditure has had to be cut back very severely to meet the formula cuts. Part of thereduction has fallen on furniture and equipment but most has had to be found from proposed new build-ing schemes. Within the reduced sums available,priority will be given to accommodation required to implement new policies such as child benefits and capital taxes, the implementation of the dispersalprogramme, maintenance of the programme toimprove substandard office accommodation at the1975-76 level of  7 million (including furniture), a modest programme of buildings for local office
requirements for which leased accommodation is notavailable, and occupational services for essential newhirings. It is a matter of some concern to theDepartment that although the administrative costs ofrevenue collection and social security payments havenot been cut, no such relief has been included in this programme for the associated accommodation ser-vices; if the capital expenditure only on these ser-vices had been exempted, there would have beenadditions to the totals shown in Table 14 of 1-5 million in 1977-78 and  0-7 million in1978-79. The main effect of the capital expenditure cuts is that it will not be possible to start during the survey period more than one, or at most two, of thefollowing major projects, previously in the pro-gramme :London office buildings at Vauxhall; Royal Mintsite; Elephant &amp; Castle; Horseferry Road andMarsham Street.Restoration and enlargement of Old Public Offices,Whitehall and Richmond Terrace, Whitehall.Ministry of Defence Offices, Foxhill, Bath.Reconstruction of 6/14 Waterloo Place, Edin-burgh.A Government Conference Centre in London.The effect will be to delay improvements in accom-modation and to further postpone the time when thestock of Crown buildings can be increased to makelong-term economies by reducing the rent bill.4. Furthermore, the formula cuts have caused adownward trend in the amount of money to be spenton this programme between 1975-76 and 1978-79.Bearing in mind that the number of staff to be housed and the size of the estate will have increasedmeanwhile, the requirement to continue this trend togive yet lower expenditure in 1979-80 is likely to involve a further reduction in the limited building programme permitted under the formula cuts and,in the Departments view, may possibly slow down the dispersal programme.5. The Treasury, however, considers that whilst the reductions made in this programme will reduce thelong-term economies otherwise available from ahigher total of owned office space, the amounts left in the programme should, with rearrangement of priorities as necessary, be sufficient to meet essential needs including adherence to the planned dispersalprogramme.Stationery and printing (home)6. Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office supplies Govern-ment Departments with their printing, stationery andoffice machinery, and is responsible for the printing and in most cases the publication, distribution and sale of Government publications.7. Although Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office tries tomeet Departments&apos; requests for stationery and printing economically, in the main it cannot rejector reduce them. A proportion of requirements for1977-78 and 1978-79 have been excepted fromreductions, but no exemption was given for 1976-77,and sporadic interruptions of supplies are expected.Provision for expenditure on office machinery, whichis mostly related to increasing efficiency or reducingstaff, falls well below known needs, and will sufficeonly for replacement of worn-out machines and a quarter of other demands.Computers and telecommunications8. The general aim in installing computers is toimprove departmental efficiency and to widen thepolicy options. The Central Computer Agency(CCA) gives advice to Departments on computersystems and equipment and on project and installa-tion management and provides centralised pur-chasing and contractual services. The Agency isalso responsible for policy and financial control oftelecommunications used in Government for admini-strative purposes.9. The reduced forecasts would require the can-cancellation or deferment of certain projects which are designed to improve departmental services and efficiency; detailed proposals by the CCA to this effect are under consideration by Departments. Inaddition there will have to be a greater resort tohiring equipment, which is more costly in the longrun than purchase. The Agency foresees a problem in that increasing commitments for hire charges and essential maintenance, while total expenditure is pro-gressively restricted, will reduce the ability to obtainnew or replacement machines to carry out policies towhich Departments are committed.Home publicity10. This covers expenditure on publicity cam-paigns which are carried out by the Central Officeof Information and Scottish Office for other Govern-ment Departments and includes the related printingcosts on Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office Vote.
Publicity is directed principally at audiences in theUnited Kingdom through the media of Press and television advertising, films, exhibitions and publica-tions in support of departmental policies. the reductions for 1976-77 and following years will necessitate economies in the publicity programmes for all departments including the major continuingcampaigns.Civil superannuation11. The forecasts take into account increasesexpected in the numbers of new superannuationawards and in the average size of individual awards.Provision has been made for a once-for-all paymentof  40 million in 1975-76 for the cost of trans-ferring to the Civil Aviation Authority the accruedpension rights of some 7,500 civil servants who aretransferring to the Authority.   (This payment is classified as public expenditure but does not repre-sent a claim on resources until the pensions inquestion come to be paid.) With the transfer ofthese staff, an annual &quot; secondment contribution &quot; ofsome  4-0 million from the Authority will cease,increasing net costs by this order throughout the survey period. Within the period of the Surveyexpenditure is not likely to be more than mar-ginally affected by the new State pension scheme proposed in the Social Security Pensions Bill.Other common services12. This programme covers the cost of legal ser-vices, the Government Actuary, Civil ServiceCatering Services and Transport services. Reducedexpenditure by the Treasury Solicitors Office willprobably impair the legal services performed forother departments.

Table 15 shows the division of Northern Irelandexpenditure between Northern Ireland departments and United Kingdom Departments. It does not include (i) the cost of food subsidies and price guarantees for milk and wool which appear for theUnited Kingdom as a whole in Table 2.3: NorthernIreland&apos;s share of this in 1975-76 is roughlyestimated at  25 million reducing to  5-5 million in 1979-80; (ii) expenditure by the InterventionBoard for Agricultural Produce on market regula-tion   operations   to   implement   the   common agricultural Policy in the United Kingdom as awhole (also in Table 2.3); and (iii) extra costsattributable to the Army&apos;s task in Northern Ireland,which are included within the figures in Table 2.1and are of the order of  42 million in 1975-76.Part A: Northern Ireland Departments2. Cmnd. 5879 referred to further measures in thefield of social and economic planning which were under examination but which had not progressed tothe stage at which their financial implications could
be assessed. In view of the serious economicsituation and the need for the greatest restraint in public expenditure, Northern Ireland departments have drastically re-examined not only their proposed measures but also the content of their existing programmes. As a result new priorities have been worked out and room has been made within existing programmes for those measures and additionalitems of expenditure which are considered to beof the highest importance.3. Priority has been given to housing (a recentsurvey has shown that the condition of the housingstock in Northern Ireland is worse than in anyother region); to the creation of jobs in areas of high unemployment and to those aspects of other programmes such as health and education whichcan directly bring help and relief to areas of specialdeprivation. This priority is given at the expenseof severe curtailment of other programmes notablyroads (where the reduction resulting from theformula cuts and from reallocations is an averageof 31 per cent a year) and plans for the compre-hensive redevelopment of urban areas includingareas in Belfast which have been badly affected by civil disorders. Despite the priority given to housing, it has been possible to find the extraresources needed for the repair and improvementof the existing stock of houses only by curtailingthe programme for new houses in the public sectorfrom 50,000 to 42,000 houses in the period. Theloss of 8,000 houses will be a severe blow and will further delay the long-overdue replacement of unfitdwellings.4. The net effect of these changes is to reduce expenditure by Northern Ireland Departments bysome  17 million in 1976-77,  30 million in1977-78 and  50 million in 1978-79 compared withCmnd. 5879. In addition Northern Ireland Depart-ments have further reduced their programmes by 34 million over the Survey period to offset partof the additional expenditure by the NorthernIreland Office on law and order.5. In the view of the Northern Ireland Depart-ments, the effect of these reductions is likely to bevery serious. In the health programme the cut in capital expenditure will mean a slowing downthroughout the service and will be particularlysevere on some of the larger hospital schemes forwhich there is an acute need. No money will beavailable for the necessary development of personal social services and community care where there arealready serious deficiencies to be made up by com-parison with the rest of the United Kingdom.6. The school building programme will be unableto provide for more than basic needs; and therewill be a serious delay in the development of ser-vices such as nursery education and recreationaland community facilities which can play animportant part in improving social conditions inNorthern Ireland and in helping to restorenormality.7. The effects on employment are particularlyserious because the expenditure cuts necessarily fallon construction and on services which are labourintensive. Northern Ireland Departments estimate that the reduced level of expenditure will mean that some 5,000 jobs which were expected underthe programme in Cmnd. 5879 will not nowmaterialise and that about 10,000 existing jobswill be lost. This loss of existing jobs alone isthe equivalent of a 2 per cent rise in unemploymentin Northern Ireland, which in June 1975 was38,506 or 7-4 per cent.8. No provision has been made for possibleexpenditure to offset the competitive disadvantages of the pig and poultry industries in NorthernIreland. The amount of money involved is put at  19 million over the period. It may also benecessary to extend help to the pig and beefprocessing industries beyond the present year. Thiswill depend largely on decisions taken from time totime on the value of the Green Pound in the irish republic and in the United Kingdom. Currentlythe scheme costs  2-4 million a year. No provision has been made beyond 1975-76 for expenditure of 2-7 million a year on grants to commerce andindustry to help to meet the cost of special security measures on business premises. The security situa-tion will dictate whether the expenditure must continue.Part B: United Kingdom Departments9. In the view of the Northern Ireland Office, theGovernment^ direct legal responsibility under theNorthern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 for lawand order in Northern Ireland cannot be dischargedwithin the Survey totals shown in Part B of Table2.15. To keep within the totals would entail adecision to reduce law and order services. Thiswould  immediately  raise   questions  about  the
Governments determination to exercise its responsi-bilities in Northern Ireland, and would so increasethe risks of eventual greatly increased securityexpenditure.10.  The detailed consequences are as follows:(a) Police. The proposed Police Training Collegehas been dropped from the programme; andthe replacement of certain obsolete stationswill not proceed. The recruiting programme for police and associated services, announced in September 1974, could not be put intoeffect within the Survey totals.(b) Prisons. The Survey totals would mean thatthe expected number of prisoners could notbe accommodated, and that it would beimpossible to get away from the present useof the compound system, which has attractedsevere international criticism.(c) Compensation. Payments under the NorthernIreland Criminal Injuries to Persons and property Acts currently total some  50million a year. This total is chiefly deter-mined by the level of violence. although a review of the compensation system is in train, it cannot be assumed that it will leadto a reduction in expenditure.11. After allowing for  34 million offsets byNorthern Ireland Departments, the Northern IrelandOffice consider that expenditure in the period ofthe order of  15 million in 1976-77, to  21 million in 1977-78,  18 million in 1978-79 and  27 million in 1979-80 is needed beyond the Survey totals, inorder to sustain the Governments responsibility for law and order in Northern Ireland. These figures include a total of  16 million for the cost of thenew permanent prison at Maghaberry.

1. The Public Expenditure White Paper published in January 1975 (Cmnd. 5879) made it clear that local authorities&apos; expenditure and their demand on manpower would need to be subject to continuingrestraint. For 1975-76 local authorities were askedto restrict the growth in their current expenditure and manpower to inescapable commitments. Fol-lowing the Budget statement of 15th April 1975, theLocal Authority Associations as members of the consultative Council on Local Government Financewere advised that the planned rate of growth in their current expenditure between 1975-76 and 1976-77had been reduced from 3 per cent to about l\ percent and that for planning purposes it would not be unreasonable to assume a nil rate of growth in1977-78 and 1978-79. The means of achieving the objectives are considered in Annex C to Part 1 ofthis report. The estimates of current expenditure shown inTable A above are taken from the individualprogramme tables in Part 2.3. The outturn for 1973-74 reflects the actualoutturn as submitted by local authorities. Theestimate for expenditure in 1974-75 is based onprovisional outturn information.4. The estimates shown for 1975-76 for individual programmes are the levels of current expenditure which were approved for the 1975-76 rate support grant settlements (except that the estimates for housing in England and Wales have been decreased by about  100 million). The Consultative Councilhowever, accepted on 1st August that the bestevidence available indicated that local authorities inEngland and Wales may spend about 2 per centor  150 million more than the settlement provided.This estimated overspend is allowed for in the totalsshown above. It is not yet possible to assess pros-pects for actual expenditure in Scotland in 1975-76.5. The forecasts of expenditure for 1976-77 to1979-80 have been prepared by Departments in thelight of the April 1975 Budget and the 1975 Surveyground rules. The estimates show for England andWales a decrease in 1976-77 of 1-6 per cent overestimated expenditure in 1975-76.* In Scotland theestimates for 1976-77 show an increase of 1-8 percent over the intended level of expenditure in* This decrease reflects in part the action taken to limit housingrent increases in 1976-77 as announced in Cmnd. 6151. Theestimates for current expenditure on goods and services are broadly equivalent to a standstill.1975-76. For the period from 1976-77 to 1979-80the estimates for Scotland show a reduction ofabout 1 per cent. Those for England and Walesshow an increase of 1 per cent, becauseDepartments have assumed that a greater propor-tion of the expenditure reductions required by the1975 Survey ground rules would fall on other expenditure. The implications for the main localauthority services of restricting their total expendi-ture to these levels are described in detail in theprogramme chapters of this Report and are sum-marised in Annex C to Part 1.&quot;Relevant&quot; expenditure for rate support grant6. The rate support grant negotiations betweenthe Government and local authority associations arenot conducted solely in terms of current expenditure as defined in public expenditure Surveys but oflocal authorities&apos; rate fund expenditure in theirrevenue accounts (subject to minor adjustments and,since 1975-76, to the inclusion of capital expendi-ture on transport). It is this expenditure which is&quot;relevant&quot; for rate support grant purposes. it includes loan charges, revenue contributions to capital expenditure and other items which fall onthe rate fund but do not rank as public expenditure.On the other hand, it does not include, in par-ticular, that part of expenditure on student awardsand on rent rebates which is met by CentralGovernment grants.7. These differences in definition give rise to problems of communication between CentralGovernment and local authorities, who repeatedlyask for reconciliation (as shown in Tables B &amp; Cabove in aggregate and by main programme)between public expenditure figures as published inthe annual White Paper and relevant expenditure;and for Ministerial statements about the acceptablelevel of current expenditure to be interpreted forthem in terms of &quot; relevant&quot; expenditure, which is directly related to their own accounting and controlsystems. It is clearly in the Governments interestto meet these requests for better understanding.But there are major problems which have yet tobe resolved in discussion with local authority associations.8. The main difficulty arises in connection withloan charges: the real burden of these chargesdepends primarily on future interest rates and therate of inflation, both of which are very uncertain(especially over a five-year period); and, to a much
smaller extent, on changes in the level of capitalexpenditure and in the proportion of outstandingdebt that needs refinancing. The estimates of relevant expenditure in this Special Analysis are based on the neutral convention that the realburden of loan charges will remain constant at its1975-76 level.9. Even on this basis, however, there can be significant differences between the rates of growthimplied by estimates of current expenditure andthose of relevant expenditure. In part, these differences are attributable to variations in theamount of capital expenditure met from revenue;and the estimates which Departments have madefor future years reflect the fall in capital expendi-ture by local authorities shown in this Report (and summarised in Special Analysis 2).

The financing of relevant expenditure10. The high rate of growth in the volume oflocal authority relevant expenditure in the early1970s and the rapid increase in the rate of inflationhave created great problems in the financing of relevant expenditure. As Table D above shows,relevant expenditure in Great Britain at outturn prices has risen from just under  4,000 million in1970-71 to an estimated  10,900 million in 1975-76.While rates have not kept pace with the growth in expenditure they have more than doubled from 1,800 million in 1970-71 to  4,100 million in1975-76. Aggregate Exchequer Grants, however,have more than trebled in the same period from 2,300 million to  7,200 million.11. Expressed as a percentage of the approvedlevel of relevant expenditure, Aggregate exchequer grants have increased as follows:England ScotlandandWales1970-71 57 65J1971-72 57* 661972-73 58 66 1973-74 60 681974-75 60J (-)- special provision     68 (4- special provision= 6ft) = 71)1975-76 66b 7512. For 1970-71 to 1974-75, the estimates ofexpenditure in Table D have been obtainedfrom returns made by Departments and the esti-mates of rates and of Exchequer grants frompublished sources. In principle, the differences between expenditure and income should reflectchanges in local authority balances; but the precisefigures shown in the table appear to reflectalso a small difference between relevant and RateFund expenditure and possibly some discrepanciesbetween the sources of the different estimates.13. The estimates of expenditure in 1975-76 take account of the estimated overspend in England andWales in that year; those for grant are consistent with the main Rate Support Grant Orders (the re-valuation from November 1974 prices to 1975-76estimated outturn prices being based on theeconomic assumptions used in the 1975 Survey). Therates forecast is based on the levels of rates struckthis year. It implies an excess of income overestimated expenditure of over  400 million. Thiswill be reduced if inflation proves to be higher thanthe 22 per cent assumed in the 1975 Survey, or if local authorities spend more than allowed for in the tables above (see paragraph 4 above).

Local authority capital expenditure in GreatBritain as summarised in the table above shows asubstantial increase from 1971-72 up to 1974-75,followed by a sharp fall in 1975-76 and 1976-77 toa level significantly lower than in 1970-71. The effectof the 1975 Survey ground rules is to reduce localauthority capital expenditure by a further 2-9 percent in 1977-78, 1-2 per cent in 1978-79 and 3-per cent in 1979-80.2. In England and Wales, a distinction is made between key sector services such as housing and
school-building which are subject to specificDepartmental approval and the locally determinedsector within which local authorities are free toset their own priorities.3. Expenditure on key sector services stands at about  2,400 million in 1976-77, somewhat lower than in the early 1970s and considerably less thanthe peak of  3,187 million in 1974-75. For theperiod 1977-78 to 1979-80 it is estimated to continue at about  2,400 million a year. It should be notedthat within the total, housing expenditure is fore-cast to rise from  1,688 million in 1976-77 to 1,789 million in 1979-80 and that on the communityownership of land from  21 million in 1976-77 to 95 million in 1979-80. Expenditure on other keysector services is shown to decline from  721 million in 1976-77 to  496 million in 1979-80.4. Expenditure on locally determined services(largely environmental services, local administration,minor transport schemes and school equipment) hasvaried between  600 million and  740 million inthe years 1970-71 to 1974-75. Expenditure in1975-76 is estimated at  573 million and, following the April 1975 Budget statement, at  524 million in 1976-77. The effect of the 1975 Survey groundrules is to produce estimates showing further substantial reductions in expenditure to  387 mil-lion in 1979-80. This is in line with the overallreduction in key sector services other than housingreferred to above. The pattern of spending up to1974-75 reflects local priorities; for subsequent years the programme shares are based on Depart-ments&apos; estimates and can be no more than a guide-line.5. In Scotland, local authority capital expenditurein 1976-77 is estimated at  575 million. The 1975Survey ground rules produce an estimated expendi-ture of  447 million in 1979-80. Of this reduction of 68 million,  29 million falls to education,  19million to housing and  11 million to roads andtransport.

It was an essential feature of the 1975-76 rate support grant settlements that there should be noexpansion in total staff numbers beyond a verysmall increase necessary to meet inescapablecommitments. The Government and the localauthority associations have since established for england and Wales a Joint Staff Watch Group anda new system of quarterly returns designed toreveal quickly any increase in numbers of staff over those already in post. It is envisaged that thewatch on staff numbers will be extended to scotland in the near future.1	1	1	1	1	1	1	124	24	24	24	25	25	25	2512	12	12	12	12	12	12	1232	34	35	36	36	36	36	3621	22	23	24	24 ,	23	22	2297	104	109	111	112	109	105	10416	19	22	23	23	23	22	224	4	4	4	5	5	5	5207	220	230	236	238	234	228	2272,117    2,208    2,251     2,272    2,267    2,264    2,2722. The Government have also made clear in para-graph 16 of &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd.6151) that:&quot;As regards the rate support grant settle-ment for next year, 1967-77, the calculation of the grant will be on the basis that pay settlements both in the remainder of this yearand in next year conform to the pay limit. Noextra grant will be payable either in the mainsettlement for 1976-77 or in increase orders on account of that part of any general pay
settlements which exceed the limit. In addi-tion, unless staff numbers are tightly restricted,the Government will have to reconsider thescale of provision of grant.&quot;3. It is therefore essential that there should bereliable estimates of local authority manpower andthat these should be considered at the same time as the programmes for expenditure.4. The manpower figures above are in terms of full-time equivalents, with part-time employees generallycounted as half. They include employees in localauthorities&apos; revenue producing undertakings, e.g.housing and passenger transport, as well as thosein rate fund services. The estimates for individual services are based on Departmental returns, except those for roads and transport where estimates havebeen made by the Treasury.5. The estimates show an increase in localauthority staff numbers in Great Britain of about175,000 or 9 per cent in the two years to 1 April1975.6. The estimates for 1975-76 were made before itwas recognised that local authorities in England andWales may spend about 2 per cent more than the1975-76 settlement provided (Special Analysis 1).The 2 per cent increase in staff numbers shown inthe table above may therefore be understated. Itis not yet possible to assess the prospects for actual expenditure or manpower trends in Scotland in1975-76.7. The estimates provide for no growth in localauthority manpower over the period 1 April 1977 to1 April 1980.

Increases in the Chancellor of the ExchequersDepartments will provide additional staff in the inland Revenue to deal with extra work resultingfrom the 1974 and 1975 Budgets, and the new development land and capital taxes commitments.In Her Majesty&apos;s Customs and Excise the increases in staff will be needed for e.c. work and thecontrol of VAT.5. In the Department of Employment (line 4)changes in the number of staff result from new legislation (Health and Safety at Work Act andEmployment Protection Bill), and from movements in the forecast level of unemployment. The figuresdo not take any account of the fact that the staffof the Manpower Services Commission and itsAgencies will return to the Civil Service if theEmployment Protection Bill receives the royal assent. The number of staff involved would be22,600 at 1st April 1976, with a forecast growthto 27,100 at 1st April 1980. This increase isrequired for improvement in training and employ-ment services.6. In the Department of Health and social security (line 5) the changes result from the intro-duction of new Benefits (Child Benefit Bill, social security Pensions Bill), changes in national insurance regulations, and movements in the fore-cast level of unemployment.7. The main factors in the increases in theDepartment of the Environment (line 6) up to 1st April 1977 are requirements for communityland, the completion of the build-up of staff forcentralised driver and vehicle licensing and addi-tional commitments in the Property ServicesAgency. Thereafter, increasing requirements for community land should be more than offset by reductions in staff employed on centralised licensing,due mainly to the end of parallel rurming withthe local authority system. There are also reduc-tions in Ordnance Survey manpower.8. In the Home Office (line 7) the biggest increase during the early years of the Survey period is forthe provision of staff in the Prison Service to keep pace with prison population and to reduce over-crowding and overtime working. This factor alsoaffects Scottish Office requirements and is the main reason for the increase in line 8. Other factorscontributing to the increase are immigration staff and Police support personnel.
5.  Public expenditure the table below shows the distribution of wages and salaries expenditure analysed by main programme.While the bulk of expenditure by public authorities on manpower is included, the table excludes elements of remuneration attributed to other economic cate-gories, e.g. pay of staff working on constructionprojects charged to capital account; professional feesof doctors, dentists, etc.; pay which forms part of theon wages and salariesoperating expenditure of Central Government andlocal authority trading services; and expenditure on wages and salaries by public corporations. Expendi-ture falling within the economic category &quot; wagesand salaries &quot; accounted for 25 - 5 per cent of total public expenditure in 1974-75 and will fall to just under 25 per cent in 1979-80 on the basis of the programmes set out in Part 2 of this Report.  million at 1975 Survey prices		1970-71	1971-72		1972-73		1973-74	1974-75		1975-76	1976-78	1977-78		1978-79	1979-801.

7.  Public Expenditure Savings through Lower StandardsBackground1. In preparation for their discussion of the 1974Public Expenditure Survey the Cabinet asked theCentral Policy Review Staff (CPRS) to examinethe possibilities for making public expendituresavings through greater austerity in the standards of equipment and buildings in the public sector,including the possibility of low-cost housing. the cprs report was recirculated to Ministers asMISC 52(74)13 as background for the meeting at chequers on 17th November 1974 about strategy and Priorities. However, it was not specificallydiscussed and, in his minute of 24th December tothe Secretaries of State for the Home Department,the Environment, Social Services, Education and science and Scotland, the Prime Minister askedfor reports about what action had been taken and what further action was planned.2. The Ministers concerned replied to the PrimeMinisters minute in February and March of thisyear. The Prime Minister asked that the treasury and the CPRS should follow up these replies with departments and let him know the outcome in due course. It was decided that the inter-departmentaldiscussions on the 1975 Public Expenditure Surveywould be the most convenient opportunity for the follow-up exercise.CPRS suggestionsThe original CPRS review highlighted thefollowing main areas where there might be scope for public expenditure savings through lowerstandards:(i) The Department of Education and Science(DES) and the Department of Health and social Security (DHSS) should study the potential cost advantages of industrialisedbuilding techniques.(ii) The Department of the Environment (DOE)should study the scope for cost reductions in housing by:(a) more use of portable (factory built)houses(b) lower housing space standards(c) lower standards of finish and materials(d) reducing the provision of car space in new public sector housing projects.(iii) DOE should consider the effects of reducingthe level of improvements grants.(iv) DHSS should examine areas where theprovision of hospital beds is above thenational average and identify potentialeconomies.(v) DHSS should encourage the use of short-life buildings, where they are appropriate.(vi) More DHSS guidance should be given aboutthe effectiveness of equipment.(vii) DES should encourage the use of temporarybuildings; and the improvement rather thanthe replacement of school buildings.(viii) DES should consider giving guidance on the&quot; reasonable&quot; level of equipment provisionper child.(ix) The target rate for the growth of telephonesin the domestic sector should be reviewed andsome quantification made of the effects of reductions in employment.(x) There should be a study of standards on therailways; and of the proportion of invest-ment in London and the South East.3. The following paragraphs summarise the main points arising from the Survey discussions of pro-grammes where savings through lower standardsmight be possible.Defence4. Substantial savings in the general administra-tive under-pinning of the Services (the &quot; supportarea&quot;) are already being made as a result of decisions taken in the course of the defence review. In addition, the Ministry of Defence have carefully considered whether reductions can bemade in the construction standards for hospitals,schools and living accommodation for the Services.5. The Forces hospital requirements will fall as aresult of the Defence Review and the provision ofbeds will be reviewed in the light of the report
of the Defence Medical Services Enquiry Com-mittee. Standards for building and equipment ofService children&apos;s schools overseas are comparable with those for State schools in the United Kingdom.6. As far as provision for housing the Services isconcerned, the Ministry of Defence point out thatsuccessive cuts in the works Vote have slowed down programmes of building new single accom-modation and modernising existing accommodation.Existing single accommodation is regarded asinadequate in area and provides accommodationmainly of the dormitory type. Improved standardsmaking for greater privacy were approved several years ago, but as a result of the general pressure onthe Defence Budget very little progress has yet beenmade with their introduction. A great deal of accommodation to the old standard will therefore remain in use for many years ahead. This will affect the general living conditions of Servicemenand the Ministry of Defence do not consider itacceptable that, in addition, reductions should bemade in the standards of such new accommodationas can be provided. Married quarters for Service-men are based on local authority (Parker Morris)standards, which are not being changed, and inthose circumstances, the Ministry of Defence do notconsider it would be right to reduce married quarters standards. Some minor savings may bepossible, e.g. by reducing the provision for garagesand expenditure on landscaping; but, insofar as theprovision of new living accommodation has to be restricted by the amount of money available, theMinistry of Defence would wish to continue withits policy of spreading out the programme ratherthan reduce existing standards which have beenaccepted as no more than reasonable.Housing7. The figures for Housing in Table 7 provide for savings of  8 million in 1975-76,  24 million in1976-77,  48 million in 1977-78 and  76 million in1978-79. These savings will be achieved by restric-tions in the provision to be made for car parking in public sector housing schemes and by changes in thebalance of housing programmes to include moredwellings for smaller households. They will be facilitated by changes in the housing cost yardstickand by savings arising from the simplification of house design and greater use of standardised plans,components and forms of construction. Furtherguidance is being considered on ways of reducingunder-occupation and on possibilities for economy in the provision of housing estate roads and foot-paths.Education8. There is little scope remaining in the educationfield for economies through lower standards. Thebuilding cost limits in England and Wales have operated to reduce space standards to their lowestlevel since the war and they are now close tothe statutory minimum. A study is in progress toexamine the position in Scotland; meanwhile a tokenreduction has been made in the Scottish cash pro-vision for 1975-76.9. The use of industrialised building methods is widespread in England and Wales, and less so inScotland. But this technique is generally thought to save time rather than money. Temporarybuildings are used wherever the need is urgent or temporary but the penalties in maintenance costs are high if they are kept in use for very long,resulting in poor value for money. Furthermore,their mere attachment to an existing school wouldoften not be sufficient by itself because of the resulting overload on central services (kitchens,halls, gyms etc.). A PAR has just been started on the criteria for decisions on whether to rebuildor remodel older schools.10. The level of provision of teaching equipment is at the discretion of local authorities and pastattempts at guidelines to achieve a degree of standardisation have not been successful. Furthermore the publication of standards would be more likely to increase expenditure (through &quot; levellingup &quot;) than to reduce it, at least in the short term.Health and personal social services11. For hospital building, a rigid system of costcontrol is employed to enforce economy in spaceand design. A review of the building guidancenotes prepared for health authorities is being undertaken to revise those where lower standardsare now thought possible. Health authorities havebeen encouraged to use industrialised building tech-techniques (bearing in mind such factors as safety, fireprecautions and cost of maintenance). A decreasein the ratio of beds to population could be achieved in the case of geriatric and mentally ill and handi-capped patients but only at the cost of extraprovision for such people in the local community.It is not possible to produce a single ratio of
beds to population in respect of acute cases that could apply to the whole country, but work is proceeding on studies which, it is hoped, will produce appropriate bed ratios for differentlocalities. There is a well-established procedure for ensuring that the procurement of supplies forthe NHS is by the most economical and efficientmethod, e.g. by placing national contracts where appropriate and by using standard specifications.Government accommodation12. There is a very close relationship between the initial cost of a building and the costs it incursthroughout its life of 60 years or more. standards of building, finish and landscaping need to be set in relation to the total cost over a building&apos;s life.Lowering standards to reduce the initial cost at theexpense of substantially higher maintenance and operating costs is uneconomic. This relationship between initial cost and life costs is being exploredin depth by a PSA PAR which started in thecurrent year.13. Space standards in accommodation for theCivil Service have not been improved since theearly 1950s.14. Maintenance costs have already been reduced in recent public expenditure cuts and this willrequire PSA to make whatever savings are possiblefor example by extending the periods betweeninternal redecorations.15. For the PSA the most fruitful area for savingslay in greater rationalisation of design and con-struction by increased use of prefabrication andindustrialised methods. The PSA are engaged in long-term continuous effort to improve practice byrationalising building procedures and techniques;this has an important influence on costs but it isnot possible to quantify it. Industrialised buildingsystems are already in use in the United kingdom on a considerable scale and the PSA is currentlyinvestigating extension of their use for diplomaticbuildings overseas, where local building costs arevery high and suitable building materials are not readily available.Nationalised industries16. The CPRS review made recommendations forreviews of the rate of growth of telephones in the domestic sector; and of standards on British Rail.These points will be covered in the separate reviewswhich Ministers have agreed should be made of nationalised industries programmes.
8.   Population and Employment (Great Britain)1. Changes in the population, either in total orin particular age groups, affect a wide range of programmes. The latest projections available based on the mid-1974 estimates of population are summarised in the following table.2. The changes from the projections made at thetime of the 1974 Survey are mainly due to the factthat the estimates of births have been reduced inthe early years of the projection. For 1979 (thelast year of the period covered in the 1974 Survey)the projection for the 0-4 age group has beenreduced by 747,000 (18-1 per cent). Changes inthe other groups are much smaller. The estimateof total population in 1979 has been reduced byjust over 700,000.3. The labour force projections are unchangedfrom those published last year and are based ontrends in activity rates (taken from censuses of population over the period 1951-71) applied to mid-1972 based population projections.

10.  Infrastructure expenditure for North Sea Oil1. As in the 1974 Survey expenditure on infrastruc-ture directly related to North Sea Oil has not been subject to formula reductions. The table belowshows the amount of expenditure which has been treated separately for the purposes of the Survey andwhich has been included in the relevant programmetables in Part Two of this Report.2. This expenditure has been interpreted as includ-ing that on projects which would not have takenplace within the Survey period but for the off-shoreoil developments, and projects which have been increased in scale, planned to be completed more quickly or cannot be slowed down because of oildevelopments. It includes industrial infrastructure(roads, and harbours); and certain elements of socialinfrastructure (hospitals, schools) needed to accom-accommodate the population shift induced by the north sea Oil development.
