UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S government(75) 105 COPY NO        o --&apos;0 i13 October 1975CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE DENTAL AND OPTICAL charges memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. I was asked (CC(75) 41st Conclusions) to consider with the secretaries of State for Social Services, Scotland and Wales whatpossibilities were open with the agreed National Health Service (NHS)allocations to avoid increasing dental and optical charges, as proposed bythe Secretary of State for Social Services in her memorandum C(75) 100,and in particular whether economies on the necessary scale could besecured in the cost of administration,2. The saving required amounts to  18,5 million in 1976-77, of which 16 million relates to England, about  1, 5 million to Scotland, and 1 million to Wales,    This compares with a total staff cost on theadministration of the NHS which I understand to be of the order of 200 million.    In central government, health and personal social servicesadministrative staff cost  27.4 million in England with proportionatelysmaller amounts for Scotland and Wales.3. I have considered, in consultation with the Secretary of State for social Services, what economies might be possible against this background.She has assured me that in practical terms administrative economy of anything approaching the order required is not feasible for herDepartment.    Following the cuts already announced by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in his Budget statement, she has recently issued furtherguidance to the NHS about cutting its administrative costs and she cannot expect it to shoulder any more economy.4. So far as her own Departmental administration is concerned, theSecretary of State for Social Services sees no possibility of reductions in administrative expenses on the social security side since these are largely decided by customer demand and policies already embarked on.She considers it inconceivable that the proportion of her Departmentsadministrative expenses committed to health and personal social services could be reduced by any amount significant enough to have a bearing onthis current issue.1
5. The Secretary of State is playing her full part in the fundamentalreview of the growth of bureaucracy in central and local government whichI was invited to undertake by the Cabinet on 4 August, and she has assuredme that she expects to achieve some reduction from the present levels of administrative expenditure in her Department.    But that will take time and she sees no possibility of securing early administrative economycommensurate with the sum involved in the discussion of dental and ophthalmic charges,,6. In these circumstances I have concluded that it is not practicable tofind economies of the order of  18 million in the cost of administration ofthe NHS and related services.civil Service Department13 October 19752
