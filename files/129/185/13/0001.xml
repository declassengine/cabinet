DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 113 COPY NO      813 November 1975CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for energy the SLUMP1. It is now clear that the slump is far more serious than we had expected, and our present range of policies are insufficient to deal with it.Unemployment is high and rising fast with no clear prospect of a fall, let alone a return to full employment.    Damaging cuts in public expenditure are becoming an integral part of our strategy.    The pound is sinking and reserves are befog spent.    Investment is low and falling.    There can be no confidence that United Kingdom industry will be able to meet an upturn in world trade when it comes.    Trade union leaders have warned us ofincreasing pressure from their members as living standards fall,unemployment rises and the true position becomes fully apparent.    There isno national consensus for our policy, only cynical Tory support for wage restraint and generalised public anxiety about inflation.    We shall have to choose between two alternative remedies.A. TO DEVALUE, HOLD WAGES AND BOOST PROFITS2.        If the forecasts confirm that present policies will fail there will be pressure to depreciate the pound by a further large amount and then holdwages for a prolonged period while profits rise and exports gradually pickup.    Wage restraint would have to be rigid while prices increased totransfer larger sums to the company sector.    This would not guarantee an effective industrial recovery.    Since this policy would change the conditions under which the  6 limit was agreed with the unions, and they could notdeliver continued voluntary restraint for very long, it would mean a returnto &quot;siege&quot; conditions of confrontation with the trade union movement.    Thisis not a practicable option and we should guard against it,B, TO REBUILD OUR INDUSTRIES BEHIND A WALL OF PROTECTION3,        In preference to this we should now adopt a comprehensive system ofprotection to secure a rapid boost to output and jobs, and the industrial policy set out by the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party
statement, embracing Jack Jones&apos; new investment fund proposals.    Itwould involve a clear breach with European Economic Community free traderules but would make possible a rapid industrial recovery and a long-term programme to regenerate industry which could win wide national support athome and would be understood abroad,.    It would be seen as a necessaryperiod of British re-industrialisation, using our own resources, includingour energy reserves, to rebuild our manufacturing baseDTHE CHOICE4.        Either way there will be elements of &quot;siege&quot; but our present policyis becoming untenable.    Devaluation and wage restraint could not holdpublic support long enough to succeed, even if ultimate success weretheoretically possible.    We must by now recognise that the gravity of the crisis is greater than we have hitherto believed and we must tell people the truth about the choice which has to be made,,5.        To adopt a policy of national reconstruction would involve major changes in the way economic and industrial policy is developed andexecuted.A W BDepartment of Energy3 November 1975
