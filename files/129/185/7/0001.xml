OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 107 COPY NO     g j17 October 1975CABINETMEASURES TO ALLEVIATE UNEMPLOYMENT IN THECONSTRUCTION industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, At their meeting on 22 September the Cabinet invited me, inconsultation with the Minister principally concerned, to consider whatselective increases in construction in the public sector should be approved.We should announce them as soon as possible.2. Attached is a note prepared by my officials in consultation with theDepartments concerned, proposing the lines on which alternative packagescould be devised.3. This is the last part of our necessarily limited measures to take the peak off unemployment, and in the guidance which I gave to the Press aboutthe total impact which we are trying to make I foreshadowed a package of 30 million.    Our statement said that it would comprise projects which metour social and economic priorities.4. I think we should announce the package as directed almost entirely to the Assisted Areas (and within Scotland to the localities where unemployment in construction is most serious).    In our discussions a gooddeal of emphasis has been laid on improvement of local authorities&apos; housing,&quot;While I see the attraction of this, I think we ought to offer work in severalservices with social priority, and aim to provide a flow of run-of-the-millwork for a variety of contractors and skilled and unskilled workers.    Thesethoughts underlie the scheme set out in the annexed table, which i recommend accordingly.D W treasury Chambers17 October 1975

MEASURES TO ALLEVIATE UNEMPLOYMENT:    CONSTRUCTIONNote by Treasury officials the Statement to the House of Lords by Lord Shepherd on24 September 1975 included the following section about theconstruction industry:&quot;In addition, the Government have in hand further work on theproblems of the construction industry, where they recognisethat the unemployment situation is particularly acute, and onwhich the measures which I have described will have only alimited effect.     At the same time, there is the need toavoid a continuing addition to the general run of public expenditure programmes over a period of years.     V/e are there-fore giving urgent attention to the scope for a carefullydefined programme of works relevant to our principal socialpriorities which could be put in hand quickly and completed within the coming year, so as to help provide employmentwhere it is most needed in this industrye     A statement on a carefully selected programme of works of this kind will bemade with the minimum of delay.&quot;This paper, which has been prepared in consultation with officials of all the Departments concerned, suggests how this commitmentcould be met in accordance with the various criteria alreadypublicly indicated, and seeks Ministers&apos; instructions accordingly.Criteria-2.     References in the Statement, in the passage quoted above and elsewhere, require that the measures should meet the followingcriteria:(a) The expenditure must be on construction with substantiallabour content, whether by commercial firms or direct labour organisations.     This rules out, for example, capital expend-iture within the local authorities&apos; locally determinedprogrammes on furniture.(b) The projects must be capable of being completed beforethe end of 1976-77*     This means that the schemes have to be small, simple, and easily prepared if not already waiting onthe shelf.     Such small works are also generally labourintensive, and therefore also suit (a) above.(c) The project must not lead to recurrent expenditure in later years.     Minor (mainly internal) improvements, fire.  precautions and other small works match this requirement.
5.     The guidance given in the Statement, that the works will be relevant to the Governments social priorities, suggests that thefirst services to be considered in allocating the available money-should include housing, education, health and personal social&apos;services and related environmental services; and further thatthere would be merit in weighting the allocation in favour ofinner city areas.fiedgg 5h a r ecs forithocationsbe givenControl4. The responsible Departments and the Treasury are satisthat, with appropriate decisions on the volume of the packsthey have the means to ensure that programmes of works whicundertaken would conform with the criteria described above.Special arrangements would be made with the local authoritithe education and (separately) other services, and with heaauthorities for their services. For the local authoritiesservices the principle would be that they would bid for all for their proposed works and specific authorisations wouldsubject to assurance that the criteria would be met. Theprinciple of first come, first served,would apply as necesslest the programme should be delayed.Regional distribution5.     All areas of the country are suffering unemployment in theconstruction industry, and no part of the industry is unaffected,But since the object of policy is to deal with specially acutesituations, it is important to note that the Assisted Areas arethe worst affected.Unemployment in construction, by region, June 1975South EastEast AngliaSouth WestVest MidlandsEast MidlandsYorkshire and numberside*North West*North*Vales*Scotland*Great BritainNorthern Ireland*Wholly comprises Assisted Area&quot;Tartly comprises Assisted AreaSources:   Department of Employment and Ministry of Finance, NorthernIrelandThousands	oL /029.4	7.63.6	7.712.3	12.010.9	9.77-7	9.412.8	10.625.5	&apos;15.815.8	14.712.8	16.919.1	10.3149.8	Ar\ p I \J c 09.8	21.1Ministers will wish to consider whether they should confine the
programme of works to the Assisted Areas; and in Scotland, whetherthey should similarly differentiate between localities where theconstruction industry is hard hit and those where developmentrelated to North Sea oil is sustaining it.6.     The available public guidance on the size of the programme isthat which was given by the Chancellor at the ministers press conference on 24 September in explaining the effect of thecomplete package of measures on unemployment:&quot; ... a. limited scheme to help unemployment in the construction industry ... likely to cost a sum of the same order as thecreation scheme - let me say round about  30 millionAllocation7.     The original proposal from the Department of the Environment-related only to the improvement of local authorities&apos; housing andthe whole of the  30 million could be spent in this way by theend of 1976-77-     Alternatively, such a sum could be divided between several services as in paragraph 3*     The allocations to scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also require considerbut whether within such a total or in addition to it, they would  -be of the order of  3  million,  2^ million and  2 million respectively if they are to be broadly proportionate to the incidence of unemployment in the construction industry.Priorities in Northern Ireland might be markedly different fromthose elsewhere.conclusions.     Ministers are invited -(a) to endorse the criteria for works for the relief of acute unemployment in the construction industry which are set out in paragraphs 2 and 3;(b) to decide on the amount of money to be made availablefor the works (para 6), and its allocation between England,Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (para 7);(c) to decide whether in England they wish to concentrateiis allocation on Assisted Areas, and in Scotland in favourof localities where unemployment in construction is mostacute (para 5);(d) to decide also whether they wish to concentrate itsallocation on a particular service (eg improvement of localauthorities&apos; housing - para 7) or to divide it among severalservices as in paragraph 3.Amount- 3 -
