o o ^6 0 JDOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)3.(65) 11G4th August, 1965CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  OVER3EA3 AIDNote by the Ch ancellor of the Ex chequerAt the Cabinet meeting on 29th July (C. C. (65) 45rd Conclusions,Minute 3) I was asked to arrange for the Group of Ministers who had originally considered the public expenditure programme to have anotherlook at the allocation for overseas aid.    We have done so in the light ofthe annexed paper agreed between the Minister of Overseas development and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.After considering the position as set cut in the paper we now recommended that the cash limit for expenditure on aid in 1966-67 shouldbe  225 million, i.e.  9 million above the basic programme for thatyear.    This would have to cover all unforeseen contingencies.    Thiscash limit of  225 million should be retained up to and including 1969-70.It is, in fact,  4 million below the &quot;basic&quot; programme.mme for 1969-70 andno additional programme would be involved for that year.    Forwardcommitments must be limited so that cash disbursements will not exceed 225 million in these later years.The implications cf retaining a limit for cash expenditure of 225 million in 1967-68 and beyond could be considered again next yearwhen the desirable level of the aid programme is reviewed as part ofthe annual review of expenditure.J.   .COPY NO.Treasury Chambers, 3.

ANNEXMINISTEEIilL COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC EXPENDITUREPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;   OVERSEAS AIDReport by the Minister of Overseas development and, the Chief Secretary to the TreasuryAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 29th July, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that he had considered the overseas aid programmeproposed for 1966-67, and accepted that a substantial part of this represented inescapable commitments;   he therefore suggested that it wouldbe reasonable to plan for cash disbursements in that year totalling 225 million, and to maintain expenditure at that level in subsequent yearsup to 1969-70.2.     We were asked to consider the aid programme figures again in the light ofthe views put forward by the Chancellor, and to circulate a paper dealingalso with the implications of planning the aid programme on a cash, ratherthan a constant price basis.3.    We are agreed that it is not possible for us to submit firm proposals on the distribution of any programme representing disbursements substancially lower than the total originally submitted,since the precise nature of thissmaller programme would have to be examined in consultation with the other overseas Departments.   We are agreed however that it would be possible to plan for actual disbursements of  225 million in 1966-67,&apos;   although this figure would mean that Her Majesty1s Government would have to make a seriesof difficult decisions affecting our external relations and obligations, andwould leave very little room for the contingencies which will occur.The price basisk.     In the early stages of discussion of the basic aid programme, allfigures were stated as for most other programmes of public expenditure interms of constant prices, and the original &quot;basic&quot; programme was designed tomaintain the ratio of aid to G-.N.P. constant over the period from 1964-65 to1969-70.   It is however a feature of the aid programme that most expendituresunder it are committed on a cash basis, and all recent discussion of dis-bursements in 1966-67 has been conducted in terms of cash commitments.

5.     Thus while the figure required to maintain the ratio of GNP in1966-67 would be less than  225 million, we have arrived at this figureon a detailed consideration of commitments and near commitments, and thisis a cash, rather than a &quot;constant price&quot; figure.   To maintain disburse-ments in the succeeding years to 1969-70 at  225 million on a cash basis would be likely to mean that in 1969-70 this represented a lower ratio of SNP at that time compared with 1964-65.   But the average ratio overthe period might still be at least the same as or more than in 1964-65because of the &quot;hump&quot; year 1966-67.Recqmniendatiqns6.   Thus in view of the uncertainty about price movements it is impossibleto be.absolutely sure of the implications, in relation to the presentation of aid as representing a proportion of GKP, of maintaining the aid programme figure at  225 million on a cash basis throughout the period until1969-70.   ?&apos;e have noted that programmes of public expenditure will besubject to annual review.   17e suggest that advantage should be taken ofthis in reapect of the difficulty arising from the cash basis of the aid programme, and we recommend that:(a) for the purposes of planning public expenditure, the figure for aid disbursements should be  225 million in eachfinancial year from 1966-67 to 1969-70;(b) the implications for the years 1967-68 and beyond ofmaintaining this figure on a cash basis should be separately considered in the next annual review;(c) the level of the aid programme should also be considered in the annual reviews, particularly in relation to our balance of payments position.B.C.J.D.Treasury Chambers, S .W. 1.2nd August, 1965
