C. (65) 121 COPY NO.6 85th August, 1965CABINETLOCAL. GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Committee on Local Government Finance has been considering what could be done to improve the financial position oflocal authorities.    It has authorised the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment to proceed with the preparation of a major Bill which would greatly modify the present system, of Exchequer grants s.s well asmaking other improvements.    It is clear however that such a measurecould not be in operation until April, 1967 even if it was introduced inthe next Session.2.      The Committee has also been considering the possibility of introducing a measure of relief to ratepayei^s with low incomes inadvance of the general measure of rating reform.    This would require a short Bill introduced early next Session to come into effect inApril, 1966.    The cost of the scheme for relieving people with a family income below a certain level might be of the order of  30 to 35 million;  and of this it has been suggested that a large proportione. g. 75 per cent might be met by the Exchequer.     There would therefore be some increase in general taxation offset by lower localtaxes on poorer people.3.      The Committee on Local Government Finance considered that itwould be premature at this point in time to ask Cabinet to decide whether a system of rate rebates should be introduced from April, 1966.They suggest that a decision might be taken before the next Sessionbegins, in the light of the situation then.    Subject to the views ofCabinet they have, however, authorised the Minister of Housing andLocal Government to prepare a short Bill which could be introducedvery early in the Session.    It could also provide for the payment ofrates by instalments.    If it was decided not to go ahead with a short bill, it would be possible to include these provisions in the major Billon local government finance which is also under preparation for laterintroduction.L.
