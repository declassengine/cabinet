I.     INTRO IUCTI0N1,    The purpose of this Yftiite Paper is to describe, with the necessary back-ground, the principles which should govern a co-ordinated national fuel policyand the machinery and measures whereby the Government proposes to secure and maintain such a policy.2,    The fuel needs of Britain are met by the nationalised coal, electricity and gas industries and by the oil industry.     These industries employ in total about one million men or 4 per cent of the working population:   their capital investment in 1965 will be in the region of  1,000 million - about one-sixth ofthe country&apos;s total investment:   the annual turnover of the industries is about 3,000 million:   and the value of their net output is about 5 per cent ofthe national product.3.    Adequate supplies of fuel and power are essential for the community.     the productivity of labour is closely linked with the power at its disposal and increasing quantities will be needed to support the growth of the economy andthe rise in lining standards.    The pattern of fuel supplies depends primarily on the requirements of the consumers.     The size and nature, however, of the fuel-producing industries are such that Government is inevitably involved.     Itis a function of Government to ensure that national considerations, which individual consumers would not otherwise take into account in their choice, arereflected in the situation.     Government must, for example, be concerned aboutthe pattern of fuel consumption In relation to security of supply, long-termcosts, and the balance of payments.     Moreover, the fuel industries, because oftheir size and nature, occupy a focal place in the planning of the economy, both national and regional.     The Government has a more direct responsibility in thecase of the nationalised fuel industries;   in total, these finance about one-halfof their investment by borrowings from the Exchequer, and their efficiency in theuse of capital is of special importance to the economy.k*    Government policies in other fields - such as taxation, imports, land use,clean air, and distribution of industry - affect fuel policy, production and use.Conflicts of policy are bound-to arise from tine to tine, but these should bocapable of more ready and orderly solution against the background of a coherentfuel policy.- 1 -

Zl M5.    On taking office, the Government put in hand a review for the purpose of developing a co-ordinated fuel policy.     A new appraisal of policy in the lightof recent technological advances would in any case have been timely.     New rawmaterials and processes are transforming the nature and prospects of the gas industry;   the generation of electricity by nuclear power on competitive termsis now within reach;   a large expansion of oil-refining capacity is in progressjthe coal industry, though it has notable technological achievements to its credit,faces difficulties in covering its costs and holding its markets.6.    The field covered in this White Paper is very wide.     To focus the issuesvdthin a reasonable compass, compression has been inevitable, and the &quot;White Papertouches only briefly, or not at all, on many aspects of the fuel industries which, though important in themselves, are not directly relevant to the mainpolicy decisions.

i ^ 9 Ql       (j   &apos;iII.     THE STATUTORY, FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK7.     The Ministry of Fuel and Power Act, 1945, places on the Minister of power the duty of:&quot;securing the effective and co-ordinated development of coal,petroleum and other .... sources of fuel and power in GreatBritain .... and of promoting economy and efficiency in thesupply, distribution, use and consumption of fuel and power,whether produced in Great Britain or not&quot;.The Government has improved and extended the machinery for this purpose.8.     The powers of the Government to give effect to fuel policy fall into three main categories.     First, there are the general powers - for example in the fiscal and import fields- available to it for regulating the economy as a whole.Secondly, there are specific powers in relation to fuel production, of whichpotentially the most important are the powers under the Continental Shelf Act,1964, to regulate the production of oil and natural gas in the British parts ofthe Continental Shelf.     Thirdly, in relation to the nationalised fuelindustries, the Minister of Power (or the Secretary of State for Scotland in thecase of the Scottish Electricity Boards)   appoints the Boards and has certain specific powers under the nationalisation statutes.     Thus, the industriesrequire Ministerial approval for the general lines of their capital development and research programmes and for their borrowings.     The Minister also has powersto give them general directions on matters affecting the national interest.9.     In the formulation and application of fuel policy, however, the formalpowers under the nationalisation Acts are of limited usefulness.     They do not extend to the oil companieg.    Moreover, under the statutes, each of the nationalised bodies is responsible, subject to the Minister&apos;s general powers, forthe management of its own affairs.     In view of the size and complexity of theseconcerns and the desirability of fostering responsibility and self-disciplineinside them, the Government thinks that these arrangements are wise.    For the-discharge of its duties under the 1945 Act, the Government is supplementing the instruments available to it by processes of discussion and consultation at various levels.10.   Among the most important subjects covered in these discussions are the investment,   -borrowing and financial performance of the three nationalised fuelindustries - coal, electricity and gas.     Investment in these industries is- 3 -CONFIDENTIAL^

reviewed annually under a procedure by which the Ministers responsible discuss with the Boards their plans for development and capital expenditure for the fiveyears ahead.     As well as approving the general lines of these five-yearprogrammes, Ministers also fix each year an upper limit on the amount to be spent on investment during the succeeding year, and a provisional limit on investment in the year after that.     It is of the utmost importance to economic growth that the industries should earn an adequate return on both past andfuture investment.     This was one of the main objects of the White Paper on theFinancial and Economic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries published in1961 (Cmnd. 1337), which the Government has endorsed.     The Boards&apos; progress towards the financial objectives fixed under the terms of that White Paper isone of the subjects covered by these annual reviews of investment;   and the government&apos;s task - also referred to in Cmnd. 1337 - of satisfying itself that within each undertaking procedures for authorising capital expenditure are adequate, is carried out by continuing study of the subject between the Govern-ment and the individual Boards.    The capital investment reviews also aim toensure, among other things, that the programmes are broadly consistent with eachother.     This means that they oust be based on similar assumptions about thegrowth of the economy, and involves scrutiny of the underlying forecasts of demand for the various fuels.     The reviews also play a part in gearing thedemands made by the fuel industries on the nation&apos;s resources with calls fromother sectors of the economy.11.   Another subject for which both the Government and the nationalised fuelindustries have a responsibility is research.     It is of fundamental importanceto the future health of the industries that their programmes of research anddevelopment - now amounting to over  1k million a year - should be wiselyplanned and vigorously executed and that the results should be effectivelyapplied.     The research programmes of the industries (other than those of theScottish Electricity Boards, which are reviewed by the Secretary of State forScotland, but co-ordinated in practice with those of the electricity industry inEngland and Wales) are reviewed by the Minister of Power&apos;s Advisory Council on research and Development.     This Council has an independent Chairman, and membersdrawn from all the fuel-producing industries, from industry generally, from the- k -

CONFIDENTIAL ,        n g icJ w JLuniversities, government Departments and the Atonic Energy Authority.     TheCouncil considers, among other things, whether the programmes of research are adequate to the needs of the fuel industries and of consumers,whether there is a proper balance between different lines of research, andwhether there are any gaps, undue overlapping or lack of co-ordination betweenthe programmes of the different industries, and between then and other programmes, including that of the Atonic Energy Authority, in the fuel and powerfield.     The Minister of Po?/er has a special responsibility for research onproblems affecting the safety and health of nineworkers;   this research iscarried out by the National Coal Board and by the Safety in Mines research establishment of the Ministry of Power, and is reviewed by the Minister&apos;s Safetyin Mines Research Advisory Board.     On research generally, there is infornalco-operation between the nationalised fuel industries at all levels.    There isalso a Research Liaison committee of the National Coal Board and the central electricity Generating Board, -which has been expanded, on the government&apos;sinitiative, to include the gas industry also.12.   &quot;While their regular contacts with the separate industries afford Ministersadequate opportunities for discussing the affairs of each industry, there isalso a need for collective discussion with all three industries together on thedevelopnent of national fuel policy.     This is achieved in the Co-co-ordinating committee, of which the Minister of Power is Chairman and the Chairmen of theNational Coal Board, Electricity Council and Gas Council are members.     TheGovernnent is developing the work of this committee so as to make it an effective instrunent for promoting the co-ordination of the policies of thethree nationalised fuel industries, and for assisting in the formulation and execution of national fuel policy.13.   The Government considers it important to bring into consultation on fuel policy not only the heads of the nationalised fuel industries, but also leadersfrom the oil industry, from industry generally, and from the trade unions.Accordingly, the Minister of Power set up in January, 1965, an Energy AdvisoryCouncil, composed of all these interests and of representatives of GovernmentDepartments.     The  Council sits under the Minister&apos;s Chairmanship and its termsof reference are &quot;to consider and advise the Minister of Power about the energy- 5 -CONFIDENTIAL n

In the initial phase of its work, the Council has discussed estimates of energy requirements to be used asworking figures for the National Plan (cmnd.. 27&amp;k-), and considered the basis of long-term policy, and the revision of the second nuclear power programme (paragraphs69-71).   The G-overnment has taken into account the results of these discussions in preparing the present White Paper.   As circumstances change, fuel policy will need to be kept under review, and the Council will have an important continuing contri-bution to make to this work.

One ton   of oil is taken as equivalent to 1.7 tons of coal, and 280 therms of natural gas as equivalent to one ton of coal, these having roughly (on average) thesame heat content.   Nuclear power and hydro-electricity are equated to theamount of coal needed to produce electricity at the current efficiency ofsteam stations.(2)   These totals differ from the figures published in the Ministry of PowerStatistical Digest where an adjustment is made for exports and stock changeof coke and manufactured fuel.- 7 -CONFIDENTIAL^CONFIDENTIAL ,       n ,tS  14.   Fifteen years ago, the 3ritish fuel economy was overwhelmingly dependenton coal, which Supplied 90 per cent of the country&apos;s needs.   The electricity and gas industries were based almost entirely on coal.   Of the relatively small amount of oil then used, about one-half was for transport, and the requirementsvjere met largely by the import of products refined abroad.15.   At that time the impact which oil would have on the United Kingdom energymarket was not generally foreseen.   The National Coal Board&apos;s Plan for Coal,published in 1950, which was accepted by the Government of the day as an appropriate basis for framing the industry&apos;s development programme, foresaw ademand for coal in the period I96I - I965 of 240 million tons a year, including25 - 35 million tons for exports.   The Committee on the Use of National fuel and Power Resources (with Lord Ridley as Chairman), reporting in 1952, thought this estimate too low (Cmd. 8647).   Following this report, the National coal board reviewed production possibilities and formed the view that it might beable to increase output to about 250 million tons a /ear in the period 1965 to1970,     The subsequent course of events, of which the salient points are givenin Table 1, belied those forecasts of demand.Table 1

Coal and Oill6.   Coal consumption did, in fact, rise for a time and, despite a minersetback in 1952, home demand reached a peak of 217? million tons in 1956.During this period the coal industry had difficulty in meeting demand both athome and for export, and imports had to be arranged at high cost.   These reached a peak of llg- million tons in 1955, of vhich nearly half came from the UnitedStates.   Because of doubts about the industry&apos;s ability tc meet the demand for coal, the Government in 1954 took steps to encourage the use  &apos;f oil, notably in power stations.   By 1957, however, the demand for c&quot;al began to fall.Industrial activity strpped rising in the years 1956 - 1958 and, withimprovements in industrial fuel efficiency, total inland fuel consumption waslower in 1959 - an unusually warm year - than it had been in 1956.   despite this, the consumption of oil, the price of which fell back substantially afterreaching high levels during the Suez crisis, increased steadily.   P wer stations,as a result of the programme of conversion to oil firing decided &quot;n in 1954,used ever 7 million tons of coal equivalent  of  oil in 1959 &amp;s against lessthan one million tons in 1956.   This growing use of oil within a static total demand for energy meant a sharp decline in the market for coal, with immediate and serious effects on the industry.   H^rae consumption fell by nearly 5 milli ..ntons in 1957 and by over 10 million tons in each :;f the two following years.Although the B&quot;a.rd cut back production, undistributed stocks r^ose to over35 million tens by the end of 1959*17.   Following this sudden reduction in demand for coal, a number of measures were taken to help the industry.   The electricity industry was asked to stop theswitch from coal to oil.   Licences were refused for the import of Americancoal although, as a result of a fall in pithead prices and in freight rates,these imports would have been cheaper than British coal at some places for eooeusers.   In the I96I Budget, a duty of 2d. a gallon (about  2 a ton, equivalentto protection in the region of 23/- per t&quot;n of coal used for steam-raising) -was placed on oil used f:r burning.    This duty was initially imposed for revenuereasons, but its protective effect on the coal industry was one cf the factorstaken into account in deciding       retain it.- 8 -CONFIDENTIAL

These measures, the renev/ed increase in total fuel consumption which began in I960, and the coal industry&apos;s efforts to improve efficiency, arrested thefall in the demand for coal, which remained around 200 million tons includingexports in the four years up to 19^3 (the winter of 1962/63 was abnormallysevere).     But since mid-1963 the industry&apos;s difficulties have again been increasing, and on 12th April, 1965, the Minister of Power told the House ofCommons that the Government was taking a number of short-term measures to relieve them.     These comprised a temporary relaxation of the Board&apos;s financial objective (which had been agreed under the terms of Cmnd. 1337 - see paragraph10), measures to increase in 1965/66 the amount of coal taken by the central electricity Generating Board and the gas industry, and a scheme to promote the use of coal in public buildings, including a 5 per cent preference overoil in Government establishments.     It is estimated that, as a result of these measures, these consumers will take some five million tons more coal in1965/66 than they would otherwise have done.     Even so, on present indications,it does not seem likely that in 1965/66 demand for coal, including exports,will reach 190 million tons.     On 1st July, 1965, the Minister of Powerannounced further plans for assisting the coal industry, including proposalsfor capital reconstruction (see paragraph 49).19.   The increase in the nation&apos;s fuel needs from 1959 to 1964 was mot primarily by oil, which increased its share of the total from 23 to 33 per cent, with acorresponding decline in the share provided by coal.     A similar shift away from coal has occurred in every major industrial country.     In the United States,with its large indigenous resources of oil and natural gas, the developmenttook place much earlier.     In most European countries it began at the sametime as here.     In almost all of them the process has gone further thanit has in this country.     Thus, taking four of the largest coal-producing countries in western Europe, the share of coal in the national energy market had declined by 1964 to 49 per cent in Western Germany, 44 per cent in Prance, 60per cent in Belgium and 39 per cent in Holland.     The United Kingdom figure    ona comparable basis (which differs from that normally used here) was 69 per cent.20.   Table 2 analyses the demand for coal and oil since 1956 in more detail:-- 9 -

In addition there are now many&quot;non-fuel&quot; uses for oil, notably in the manufacture of chemicals, whichabsorbed over 3 million tons of oil in 1964 compared with well under one million tons in 1956.21.   Oil used for road and air transport and as refinery fuel has been shownseparately because these are readily identifiable sectors in which, broadly speaking, there is no competition between oil and other fuels.     This is truealso for the &quot;non-fuel&quot; uses and for some of the fuel uses under &quot;other purposes&quot; - e.g. agricultural traction ana coastal and river transport - but these are much smaller in comparison.     In the other sectors in the table, coal and oil are generally in competition with each other;   at power stations bothare also in competition with nuclear energy and hydro-electricity and at gas-works with natural gas.     The table shows the steady growth of oil, particularlyin the sectors in which it is in competition with coal;   and the fact that power stations are the only major expanding market for coal.22.   The expansion of oil use was accompanied by a rapid growth of the homerefinery industry, broadly in step with the increase in consumption.     Refinerythroughput, which was less than 10 million tons of crude oil in 1950, reached22-g- million tons in 1952, nearly 33 million tons in 1953, 52 million tons in1962 and 581- million tons in 1964.- 10 -9 0 PO c-&apos; t?Table 2Consumption of coal and oils / in the United Kingdom

While the share cf the energy market taken &quot;by oil has been increasing,there has also been a marked gro th in the use of electricity and gas - the two main secondary fuels.Table^Use of electricity^ /jid Jj^s ,ift j:he- United Kingdoa1950 19.55 19il 1943      1264Electricity (thousand      ^\      47.6 69.7 113.0 136.8     143.4 million kilowatt hours)&amp;as (million therms)(2) 2,371 2,6l6 2,618 2,925     3,014(1)   Wet purchases by final consumers, as defined on page 13 of Ministryof Power Statistical Digest, 19&amp;4.(2)    Sales of town gas.Electricity consumption has grown at over 8 per cent a year during the period1950 - 1964, though the rate of growth has been lower in the last two or threeyears.     The industry has invested heavily to meet the increasing demand;   but,as a result of past   under-estimation of the rate of growth in demand, and ofthe time required tc increase capacity, the industry is still hard-pressed tomeet peak demands.     Ecenemies of scale and greater efficiency have resulted insubstantial savings in costs;   and this has been reflected in electricity prices.In consequence, over most of this period the average revenue per unit ofelectricity sold has risen at a much lower rate than the average price of allUnited Kingdom goods and services.24.   Throughout the period, electricity production has been predominantly basedsn home-produced coal.   Oil use at power stations, which reached a level of over7 million tons ,r,t coal   equivalent by 1959, and sf over 0 million tons in i960, has since remained at about the latter level.   But in 1955 a step towards the develop-ment of a new primary fuel was taken with the adoption of a programme for the con-struction by the electricity industry of 1,500-2,000 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power stations for commissioning in the years i960 to I965.    This was greatlyexpanded in 1957 to a nuclear programme of 5,000-6,000 MW of capacity by 1965;subsequently the date for the completion of this programme was put back in suc-sucessive stages to end-1969.   It is now expected that by the end of 1965 at least2,500 MW of this capacity will be in service and that the programme will beoompleted by 1969.   A second programme, announced in 1964, adopted forBlectrioity and Gas

confidential ,        ^fanning purposes a figure of a further 5)000 MW of capacity to be installed ingngland and Wales in the years 1970 - 1 975;    this programme has since been  revisedupwards (paragraphs 70 and 71).     At the time tb-s first programme was drawn upit was hoped that the cost of the power produced from the firststations would be about the same as that produced from new coal-fired stations;but this hope has been falsified, mainly by the unexpectedly high capital costof these nuclear stations and the steep fall in the cost per kilowatt ofconventional generating sets, as these came to be built in ever larger sizes.None of the stations in the first programme is now expected to produce electricityas cheaply as conventional stations commissioned at the same time.     But stations to be built under the revised second programme should produce nuclear power thatis fully competitive with conventional stations (see paragraph 68).25.     As Table 5 shows, the gas industry has not expanded rapidly and continuouslylike the electricity industry over the years 1950 to 1964*     The gas indusrty was handicapped by the limitations of the coal carbonisation process, which wasnot capable of substantial further development, had high capital costs, andrequired special coals which were becoming increasingly expensive.     Gas salesrose only slowly up to 1955/ after which they remained almost st tic until 1961.But the industry had been making strenuous efforts to free itself from over-dependence on carbonisation coal.     Two large plants employing the Lurgiprocess, for producing lean gas by the total gasification of cheaper types ofcoal, were built, and the industry also pioneered the import of Saharan natural gas by refrigerated tanker.     Even more important has been the developement ofprocesses capable of producing gas cheaply from a variety of oil products.Although the full benefits cf these new sources of gas are still to come,there has already been in the last two years a marked advance in gas sales, andthe use of gas is now rising at a rate of about 8 par cent a year - even fasterthat the present rate of grovth in electricity.     There would be a furtherpowerful stimulus to the growth of the gas industry if the search for petroleumin the British part of the Continental Shelf were to result in a substantialfind of gas.Fuel Prices2d.    The trend of the prices of the various fuels in relation to each other has-12-

CONFIDENTIAL ,       o qa considerable influence on the pattern of fuel demand.   Accurate comparisonsare difficult to make because, in some cases, published prices are subject tounspecified discounts, sometimes substantial.   However, the general tendency-over the period 1950 to 1964 has been in favour of oil as against coal, in spitof the imposition of the oil duty in 1961.    Over the period 1950 to I96A asa whole, but not in the years since 1961, electricity prices generally roseless than those of gas..27.   The Ministry of Power maintains a watch on the relative prices of fuelshere and abroad.   The evidence is incomplete and difficult to interpret, butindications are that, on the whole, United Kingdom fuel prices, both domestic and industrial, compare favourably with those of our main European neighbours,though they are undoubtedly higher in general than in the United States, whichhas much greater natural resources.   Recent study of fuel prices in the UnitedKingdom and in Western Europe indicates that coal prices in this country are on average lower than in the European Economic Community;    fuel oil prices seemslightly higher on average here than in the Community countries but, takingfigures for coal and oil together, the balance of advantage is in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s favour.   For electricity too, prices here are probably rather loweron average than in the Community countries, but comparisons of national averageare of doubtful significance since the variation within each country, as aresult, for example, of the availability of cheap hydro-electricity in some areas, is so much greater than the variation from one country to another.   Forgas, also, there is considerable variation within each country.    The priceson the Continent for manufactured gas are thought to be broadly equivalent to prices in the United Kingdom, but natural gas is usually much cheaper.28.   Domestic consumers&apos; direct expenditure on fuel and light represents about one-twentieth of their total expenditure.   Although for most industries fuel isnot a large element in costs, it is a major item for some.   For manufacturing industry as a whole, fuel accounts on average for about 3^ per cent of total costs, but this conceals wide variations;    and fuel costs are heavy in some important sectors such as cement (nearly 30 per cent) and steel (rather under15 per cent).- 13 -

IT.     PROSPECTIVE DEMAND FOR ENERGY29.   To complete the background for national fuel policy, it is necessary to assess the probable course of the demand for energy in total and for the variousfuels individually.     The rate of growth in total inland demand for fuel dependsmainly on the rate of growth of the economy, while the division of the demandamong the different fuels is governed by separate decisions made by a great number of consumers - industrial, commercial or domestic - who are influenced bythe relative price and suitability of the different fuels.    Estimates about the prospective demand for energy must, therefore, be based on assumptions about thegrowth of the economy;   about the success of each of the fuel industries in improving efficiency, in keeping down costs and in selling its products:   and about Government policies and other factors affecting the relative prices of thedifferent fuels.     It is assumed, as in the National Plan, that national output   will grow 25 per cent between 1964 and 1970, an average of 3.8 per cent a year.     Recent experience of the complex relationship between the growth of energy consumption and of the economy as a whole (see paragraph 32) suggeststhat a change of one per cent a year in the assumed rate of expansion in national output up to 1970 (in either direction) might affect the estimatedannual demand for fuel by that year by about 11 million tons coal equivalent.Other assumptions, and the consequences of variation in them, are even lesssusceptible of precise treatment;   even if all the assumptions provedvalid, theestimates would still be subject to a margin of uncertainty.    While forecastingof this type is essential for formulating fuel policy, the past experiencedescribed in paragraph 15 has shown how far out estimates can be, especially those relating to particular fuels.     The estimates which follow should not,therefore, be looked on as more than broad indications of likely requirements onthe assumptions adopted.30.   In reply to the Industrial Inquiry, undertaken in the preparation of theNational Plan, each of the fuel industries provided in the spring of 1965estimates of its own sales in 1970.     The electricity and gas industries also provided estimates of their requirements of primary fuels.     The estimates wereprepared on the basis of the policies current at the time.     The initialestimates appeared too high in total;   they were revised and reconciled in- 14 -

CONFIDENTIAL .        31]discussion with the Ministry, and subsequently discussed in the Energy AdvisoryCouncil.     The revised estimates are summarised in Table 4, which incorporatesfigures for i960 and ^^Gl^.^)   these were both years of high economic activity and near normal temperatures and   hence   a comparison betv/een then gives a goodindication of recent trends in fuel consumption.Table 4Industries&apos; estimates of fuel demand in the United Kinftdonresulting fron the Industrial Inquiry for the National Plan(4)Mxllion tons of coal equivalent &apos;	I960	1964	1970Coal:			For power stations	51.9	68.0	84For gas works	22.6	20.5	10For other purposes	122.2	98.7	81Total	196.7	187.2	175(JOil (including petroleun gases):			For power stations	9.2	9.7	14For gas works	1.9	5.0	For other purposes	54.4	78.6	115^Total	65.5	93.3	144Natural gas	0.1	0.3	1-1Nuclear power and hydro-electricity	2.6	5.1	Total Inland demand for energy	264.9	285.9	337Slectricity (thousand million kilowatt	104.9	143.4	241hours]			&amp;as (million therms)	2,636	3,014	4,635(l)   Except for electricity and gas.(2)   It is estinated, on present prospects, that a further 5 nillion tonsnay be exported, giving a total estinated demand for coal of 180nillion tons.     In i960, coal exports were 5.5 million tons and in1964, 6.0 nillion tons.31.   Using the same hasic assumptions, the Ministry of Power nade separate estinatesof fuel demand in 1970, calculating both requirements for individual fuels, asin Table 4 above, and requirements for each of the nain sectors of consunption.The primary nethod enployed was to examine the trends of the various fuels,separately and jointly, within each sector.     The total inland demand for energywas assessed by the Ministry at 324 million tons of coal equivalent.     A summaryof the Ministry&apos;s sector analysis is given in the Appendix.- 15 -

32.   The difference of 13 million tons between the Ministry total (324 million tons coal equivalent) and the aggregation of the industries&apos; revised estimates(337 million) is small enough to fall within the margin of uncertainty.   TheMinistry&apos;s estimate shows an increase in total demand for energy between 1964and 1970 of 13g per cent (averaging 2.1    per cent a year), an   &quot;energy coeffi-cent&quot; of 0.55 - that is to say, an increase of 0.55 per cent a year in the con-sumption of energy for each one per cent a year growth in gross domestic product.The annual average increase in the consumption of energy in 1960 - 1964 was 1.9per cent, giving an energy coefficient of O.56.   The Ministry&apos;s estimates allow for the continued improvements foreseen in industrial fuel efficiency and, inparticular, for an expectation that fuel consumption per unit of output of ironand steel will fall considerably; and for an extra demand for energy implied bythe more rapid increase in productivity and higher standard of living envisaged by the National Plan.    It is, however, difficult to quantify the preciseallowances necessary.   To reach 337 million tons coal equivalent (the sum of the revised estimates of the fuel industries) vrould mean an increase in the energycoefficient to 0.74.   There is no evidence that the general trend is upwards(although there have been considerable fluctuations from year to year).    Butthe coefficient for the European Economic Community as a whole in 1960-1964 was nearly double that of the United Kingdom and seen in this light a coefficientof 0.74 is not high/ Moreover, if there is to be flexibility to meet changes intechnology and in consumers&apos; choice of fuels, and to give an adequate allowance for uncertainties, there should be some margin of capacity above the estimated total energy demand.33.   Prices exercise an appreciable influence -?n the relative market shares ofthe various fuels.    Estimation of the relative prices of the different fuels for years ahead is particularly hazardous, but the trend of prices in favour of oilis long-establiahed.   The estimates in paragraphs 30 and 31 were prepared beforethe Government proposed the capital reconstruction of the coal industryand the provision of the special funds that are referred to in paragraph 4$./It is an over-simplification to express as a single coefficient the relation between the rates of increase in energy consumption and in economic activity,A number of factors contribute to the relationship.   Comparisons between different countries are difficult to interpret because of differences between their energy patterns and general economic structures.- 16 -

CONFIDENTIAL- 17 -These will relieve some of the difficulties of the industry.   However, theycannot by themselves be expected to alter long-term trends and, whatever maybe the position in the more distant future, there is no strong evidence tosuggest that in the period to 1970 coal is likely to become significantlycheaper in relation tc oil.   Gas prices seem likely to fall generally, inrelation to other fuel prices, even assuming that changes are made in financialand fiscal preferences at present enjoyed by the gas industry (as suggestedin paragraphs 86 and 90 below).   Taking all these factors into account, theGovernment accepts the view, which emerged from discussions in the EnergyAdvisory Council, that it w:uld net be prudent to ccunt on a coal market in1970 above the range cf 170 tc 180 million tons including experts, which, on present prospects, may be about 5 million tens.34,   The Ministry makes longer-term estimates and, though these can provide onlybroad guide lines, they form an essential background for taking decisions fromtime to time on investment projects which require a long period to mature ane?rn their keep.   Present indications are that, even if the decline in demandfor coal slows down in the early 1970&apos;s, it is unlikely to be reversed.   Therate of expansion of nuclear power might well accelerate in the second halfcf the 1970&apos;s.   In addition, there is the major uncertainty about the availability of natural gas from under the North Sea (sec paragraphs 79 end 80).These fact&apos;rs, which cannot at this stage be quantified, could significantlyaffect demand for coal   and oil in the years after 1970.

V.     OBJECTIVES OF FUEL POLICY35.   It is against this background and in the light of these prospects that the objectives af fuel policy may be considered.    The overriding objective is that the fuel sector should make its full contribution to the strengthening of the economy and the balance of payments.    The objectives may be more specifically statedthus :-(a) Adequate and continuous supplies of fuels of suitable qualitjrshould be available to sustain the desired rate of growth in the economy.(b) The price of fuels should be such as to enable them to play their part in making the United Kingdom economy as a whole competitive,particularly in relation to other countries of Western Europe.(c) The fuel industries should be technically progressive and viable.(d) Imports of fuel, particularly of oil, which on any reckoning will grow fast, should be in the form that is least costly in terms offoreign exchange.(e) The supplies available should afford consumers freedom of choice between fuels, subject to their paying prices which fully reflectall the relevant costs.   On this condition, consumer freedom of choice, apart from being desirable in itself, is an essential guideto the efficient planning of supplies.36.   Same of the f^regeing objectives conflict with others, so that the single-minded pursuit of any one objective, such as the supply of every fuel at the cheapest current price, will not necessarily be the best for the nation.    the aim must be to secure the balance between the various objectives that is most advantageous.   For this, no static policy can suffice.   The balance ofadvantage is continually liable to change, as a result of events which are neither predictable nor controllable.   Technological changes, changes in thebalance of supply and demand for fuel, and the discovery and development of new sources of supply, have all at times affected the balance in the past, and mustbe expected to do so again in the future.    Fuel policy, therefore, must beflexible enough to move with the trend of events, and must maintain all possibleroom for manoeuvre by refraining from making, earlier than is demonstrablynecessary, major changes which it may be impracticable to reverse.

9 Asi) a37.   The objectives outlined embrace all aspects of fuel supply and demand;fuel policy needs to be similarly comprehensive and to be coherent in all itselements.     It needs also to be considered in its relation to the fuel policies of other countries, which can affect British overseas earnings.     The government believes that the policy described in the following sections fulfils these requirements.    For convenience of presentation, the policy is explained as it affects, first, each of the primary fuels - coal, oil and nuclear power - andthen the secondary fuel industries - electricity and gas.     Exports of coke and manufactured fuels are separately mentioned in the coal section (paragraph 53),and supplies of solid smokeless fuels are considered, together with other fuel supplies for clean air, in the secondary fuels section (paragraph 9l).

6 a 4)VI.     COAL38.   The most difficult single problem in fuel policy is the health andsize of the coal industry.   It is, however, clear that the country willcontinue for many years to need indigenous coal as a main primary fuel.The Government has come to the conclusion that radical changes and substantial additional assistance are necessary to enable the industry toprovide essential coal supplies in an efficient and economic fashion and tomake its optimum contribution to our economy generally and to the balanceof payments.The Present Sifaatio?a^of the Coal Industry39.   The National Coal Board has been making great efforts to strengthen theindustry&apos;s position and to increase efficiency by better use of men andmachines and by concentration on the most economic pits.   Productivity(output per man-shift) rose by 5.3 per cent a year over the period 1 960/64and is continuing to rise.   The Board leads the world in developing theapplication of automation to mining and is beginning to put a new series oftechniques to large scale use.   But costs per ton in this labour intensiveindustry have also risen, often for reasons beyond the Board&apos;s control.Proceeds per ton, on the other hand, have tended to fall.   Markets for thehigher qualities.cf coal havo tended to decline while tho lower grades, whichare in increasing demand for power stations, fetch much lower prices.   TheBoard&apos;s difficulties have been aggravated by a burden of capital debtincurred through past investment designed to meet a level of demand whichhas not materialised.   Moreover, the Board has   had&quot; to aim to achieve a marketbig enough to absorb not only the maximum output obtainable from theeconomic pits but also the output from collieries which continued inoperation even though they could not cover their day to day running costs.In present conditions this  aim can no longer,-be -sustained.40.   In the past year or two., the financial position of the Board has deteriorated.   Improvements in the industry&apos;s productivity have absorbedincreased labour costs, but have not been sufficient to offset the highercosts of materials and other expenses.   As a result, the Board was only justable to meet outgoings in 1 964/65, after taking credit for the release of some20.

financial provisions which were found to be no longer necessary.   TheGovernment had already agreed to a temporary relaxation of the Board&apos;financial objective (paragraph 18).   The unfavourable trend has continuedinto the current financial year, with the result that the Board / now hasto contemplate the prospect of introducing its first general price increase since 1960./  /To be altered if price increases have been announced before publication of the &apos;.hite Paper /&apos;.41.     Between I960 and 1 964 only two out of the eight coalfields - Yorkshire and east Midlands - made a surplus after the payment of interest.   In effect,these coalfields, which produce about half the total tonnage, have beensubsidising the others.   In 1964 about half of the industry&apos;s 540 colleriesmade losses amounting in total to about  60 million.   Of these, some 150collieries, accounting for about 20 per cent of output, operated at a gross loss(i.e. the proceeds of sales fell short of running costs and made no contribution to interest charges or depreciation).   These pits were, withfew exceptions, in the coalfields that have not been able to pay their way.They comprised collieries marked for eventual closure because there was nohope of making them economic, collieries with a doubtful future, and othercollieries, including some under reconstruction, that were expected tobecome economic.   On the other hand, some of the collieries that coveredtheir prime costs but not their total costs of production will become grosslosers in the next few years.The Case and Criteria for Protection42.     Protection for indigenous fuel industries is an accepted part of the policies of major industrial countries including the United States,France and the Federal Republic of Germany.   There are many reasons why a measure of protection should be given to the British coal industry.First, supplies of indigenous coal on the scale envisaged in the estimates insection IV, and perhaps on an even larger scale, are reasonably secureprovided that the industry is not disrupted by too sharp and indiscriminate adecline.   Secondly, although oil is more attractive to many users on price andother grounds at present, and seems likely to continue so, the possibility that21

this situation might change in the longer term cannot entirely he discounted.&amp; The coal industry is by its nature inflexible.   Capacity once lost could bere-created only with very great difficulty.    Thirdly, there are practicallimits to the rate at which the industry can contract economically - that is;,by elimination of losing collieries.     Fourthly, is is desirable that thefullest economic use should be made of the large investment already madein the coal industry.   At the same time in considering new investment in thecoal industry regard must be had to the possibility that the present scale of protection may not be continued indefinitely.   Lastly, the coal industry,which places no direct burden on the balance of payments, is a large importsaver.4.3.   The amount and form of protection given to the coal industry needs tobe reviewed from time to time in the light of developments, but there are some general considerations which ought to govern it.   In particular, theamount of protection:-(a) should not be such as to make British fuel costs uncompetitiveas compared with those of our main competitiors in IvesternEurope;(b) should not be so great as to prevent the development of anadequate and well-balanced oil-refining industry in theUnited Kingdom;(c) should be sufficient to prevent the market for coal fromdeclining faster than output can, in practice, be economicallyreduced, and to help the industry to bring about smoothlyits transition to a more compact and competitive structure,Existing^Meijiqds of Prjjtecjhon44.   The most important of the existing measures of protection, which are described in paragraph 1 7 above, are the duty on heavy oil (and other oilused for burning) and the virtual ban on coal imports.   The level ofthe   oil duty has fiscal and budgetary implications which are outside thescope of this White Paper.    The effects on the balance of payments of changesin the duty are complex, and there may be little or no advantage to thebalance of payments from any increase in the duty above its present level.On fuel policy grounds there are objections to an increase in the rate of duty.

The present rate of 2d. a gallon is much the same as the average duty onheavy oil in the European Economic Community; and an increase in the rate would increase industrial costs to the prejudice of our internationalcompetitive position.     It would also be a blunt instrument which would by itself do nothing to encourage greater efficiency in the coal industry andwhich could result in the continued operation of very high cost pits whichshould be closed as soon as possible.   Indeed, it can be argued that, on fuel policy grounds alone, a reduction of the oil duty, and hence of thecost of fuel to industry, is in principle desirable.   Although in the presentcircumstances of the coal industry there is no early prospect of such areduction, the Government yri.ll keep this question under review.45.   The ban on coal imports, which is virtually complete, cannot be made more rigorous.   Indeed representations in favour of its relaxation have beenmade by foreign Governments and by British industry.   Unrestricted importscould, however, at present involve an unacceptable fall in the demand forBritish coal and could prejudice the task of concentrating the industry inan orderly manner.   There is no practicable and fair method of limiting coal imports to those cases, such as coastal steel works, where they might be most advantageous.   The Government will, however, keep the position under review in the light of developments at home and abroad, and take into account thevarious restrictions imposed by other Governments to protect their indigenousfuel industries.Subsidies for the Coal Industry.continuing general subsidy for coal production.   Such a course would be inconsistent with the concept of a self-supporting industry, which coal can and should be.   It would lessen the incentive for the industry to increase its efficiency and competitiveness, and could carry with it the risk of a growing commitment for the Exchequer.Policy for Coal(a)   Concentration of Deep-mined Production47.   The size of the market:for coal in any particular year depends on thegrowth of industrial activity, and on the. weather and other.unpredictable factors.46.   The B oard does not seek, and the Government does not favour, a

\. The estimates in section IV above suggest, however, that the market for coalin 1970 may not exceed 170 to 1 80 million tons.   There are strong objectionson fuel policy grounds to affording the coal industry additional protectionby further measures to restrict or discourage the use of oil.   An attempt by artificial means to restore the market for coal to a level of about 190to 200 million tons a year by 1 970 v/ould, on the present pattern ofproduction and costs, be costly and probably unavailing.   The aim nov? mustbe to improve the position of the industry by further concentration ofproduction on the economic pits,   with this in view the Board will seek to accelerate the closure of gross losing pits that have no prospect of movingout of that category.2(8.   A substantial part of the industry has relatively low costs and has been consistently profitable.   Nearly 80 per cent of coal is now obtained bynechanised methods and an immediate improvement in the industry&apos;s fortunescould be obtained by fuller use of machines already installed.   The Boardplans to increase the proportion of coal won by mechanised methods to over90 per cent in the next five years.   For the future, the most promising new developments lie in the application of remote control to mining operations.At the first pit being developed to employ these new techniques, output per man shift is expected to be about 8 tons, or over four times the presentnational average.     With such developments^ the sound heart of the industry can make an increasingly valuable contribution to the future health of theUnited Kingdom economy and provide assured and well-paid employment for themen who work in the mines.49.   The size of the industry depends basically on the extent to which, throughthe efforts of men and management, these potentialities can be realised.The Government recognizes, however, that further assistance is needed toenable the industry to overcome its present problems and the legacy of thepast.   This assistance will be provided in two main ways,(i)   Social problems the Board will be assisted in dealing with the human problems towhich concentration gives rise.   Even allowing for the expected reductionin mining manpower, much of which vk1.11 be achieved by normal wastage, the

CONFIDENTIAL n    ,eS i-J -h.National Plan foresees in 1970 a substantial manpower gap in the economy as a whole, so other employment should in general be available for mennot required in the coal industry.    Difficulties arise, however, becausereductions in mining manpower will continue to be heaviest in difficultemployment areas - Scotland, the North East and South Wales.   In theinterests of economic efficiency as well as to ease the human problems towhich this reduction in manpower will give rise, it will be necessary toensure that the men affected by closures are quickly redeployed to otherproductive employment inside or outside the industry.   The Board willcontinue to develop its schemes to assist the transfer of miners to thosecoalfields and areas where future production will eventually be concentratedand where the difficulties of recruiting and retaining manpower are likely tocontinue.   The Government will provide special funds to speed the closure of uneconomic collieries by assisting redeployment within the industry and resettlement in other industries through its regional development policies.(ii)   Capital ReconstructionSecondly, the Government proposes that about  400 million out of  960million of the Board&apos;s capital debt to the Exchequer at end-March, 1965, shouldbe written off.   This will give continuing relief to the Board&apos;s finances, theimmediate relief in 1965/66 being about  30 million.   The Board will, for its part, aim to find from its own revenues the  380 million that it estimates willbe required for capital expenditure on collieries over the period from 1st January, 1966, to end-March, 1971, and to achieve a greater concentration ofthe capital available within the industry on the most promising pits.The financial aspects of these policies   will be   examined more fully in a white paper on the finances of the coal industry to be published   shortly.(b)   Opencast Coal Production50.   Opencast production occupies a small but important niche in the Board&apos;total activities.   Such coal is economical to get and it provides, in somelocalities and for certain types of coal, a valuable supplement to deep-mined25,

9 K 9ti! i! wI production.   Opencast coal production has declined from a peak of over 14million tons in 1958 to around 7 million tons a year now; and is expectedto remain at around the present level for the next few years.   The level of output can be varied fairly quickly to meet temporary changes in demand,provided basic output   is kvj t at  a   level sufficient to enable the contractors, who work the sites 4 1/2 the Board, to maintain an organisationadequate to provide a base for expansion.   On the other hand, conflictingclaims for land use and the need to preserve amenities have to be taken intoaccount, and the Board can work only sites approved by the Minister of Power.   Allthese factors will be taken into account by the Government in consideringfuture applications by the Board for authority to work opencast sites.(c) Co-operation with other Nationalised Fuel Industries and other public Authorities51 .   The electricity industry is the largest single market for coal; itconsumed about 68 million tons in 1 964, compared with 46 million tons in1956 and 52 million tons in 196O.   The growing proportion of coal production which goes to power stations has meant that the coal and electricity industries are becoming more closely bound together.   The electricity industry givespreferential treatment tc coal and the Government considers that this shouldcontinue for the present, subject to annual review.   In the gas industry thenew oil-based processes are substantially cheaper than processes founded on coal; the Government considers that the trend towards these new processesshould not be inhibited, but does not exclude the possibility of modestassistance in this market for coal.   (The subject of primary fuel use by the secondary fuel industries is more fully discussed in paragraphs 77 - 84 below,.)The Government has also decided to continue to encourage the use of coal in public buildings (see paragraph 18) subject to review from time to time.(d) Pricing Policy52.  as mentioned in paragraph 41 above,the East Midlands and Yorkshire coal-fields are at present subsidizing the others.   The long term aim of theNational Coal Board&apos;s pricing policies has been to make each coalfield self-supporting but with the burden of debt arising from past investment it hasbecome more and more difficult to achieve this aim.   The capital reconstruction26,

9 K Qei y *now proposed will provide further opportunities for the Board to secure abetter correlation between the prices and costs of the various coalfieldsand of the various coals, which the Board and the Government believe isdesirable.     In this way the price mechanism will help to identify areas where production should contract, and reduce the scale of the subsidisingof the losing pits by good pits, thus avoiding the risk of overpricing themore economic coals,(e)   Ejcgorts53.     In 1964/65, 5.3 million tons of coal and 1.3 million tons of coke and manufactured fuels, with a total value of about  33 million, were exported.In 1965/66 exports are expected to be somewhat less.     A reversal of thistrend and an increa.se of exports effected economically would have obviousadvantages for the Board and for the United Kingdom balance of payments.The Board is seeking to secure such an increase, but market conditions are difficult and longer-term contracts are becoming increasingly necessary tosecure additional business.     The main export market is Europe, and british coal has to compote with American and Polish coal which can be supplied inEurope at a price below the home price of British coal in the United Kingdom.Prices reduced to secure business are often undercut by a competitor andthere comes a point at which additional exports would not increase - and couldeven reduce - the total foreign exchange earnings.     Moreover, the coalproducing countries of the European Economic Community impose restrictions on imports, so that the volume of sales does not depend on price alone.     it current prices, increases in exports are economic only where the Board has surplus capacity and the necessary manpower available in low-cost pits, so that extra,tonnages can be obtained at costs of production very little higher than the wagescosts of the men employed.     In these circumstances, care is needed about entering into long-term commitments beyond what can be seen to be commercially justifiablein the light of plans for reorganising and reshaping the industry.Conclusions on Coal54-.    Although the estimates in section IV show that the market for coal in1970, even after talcing account of the Government&apos;s measures to assist theindustry and of probable improvements in the industry&apos;s efficiency, may not

28.exceed 170 to 180 million tons, there is no question of requiring anyarbitrary run-down in production.     The size of the industry within the framework set by the general fuel policy will depend significantly onits success in reducing costs.     Relieved of the double burden ofunprofitable collieries and past capital debt, and with the successful prosecution of the National Coal Board&apos;s own policies for improving the health of the industry, the economic part of the industry should be ablewith rising productivity to increase its output and its market.     Thecoal industry thus streamlined will continue for many years to be amain supplier of primary fuel on a basis \which will enable it to makea major contribution to the strength of the national economy.

29.q K KeJ j3 i?VII.     oil the Demand for Oil55.   In 1964, oil contributed one-third of primary ..fuel supplies.     Consumption,including non-fuel uses, is increasing at a rate of about 9 per cent a yearand is expected to continue to increase, though perhaps at a slower rate.For many uses there is no effective substitute for oil (see paragraph 21).In these fields, therefore, which account for about 40 per cent of the total tonnage and are increasing rapidly, oil is not in competition with other sources of primary energy.     For other uses - mainly steam-raising (includinguse for power generation), process work, space-heating and water-heating - oilis in competition with other fuels.     Among the uses where oil is in competition with other fuels, consumption of the light fractions (including the use ofnaphtha for gas-making) has been growing very fast in recent years.     However,the biggest single item is the consumption of fuel oil.     After a check in1963/64, partly as a result of a reduction in use at power stations, consumptionof fuel oil is now going forward again, though at a rather lower rate than thatof the light fractions.     The rate of increase in demand for middle distillateshas recently been held back by the strong competition of the gas industry inthe heating market.36.   The growth of demand for oil for the uses where it is in competition withother fuels has been encouraged by its efficiency and convenience and by itsincreasing cheapness compared with most other fuels.     Oil prices have been morestable than those of most other commodities.     Over the years, the selling price of fuel oil has fallen relative to that of coal, despite the tax of 2d.per gallon introduced in 1961.     The relative deterioration in the position ofcoal was apparently checked in 1963 and the early part of 1964, but the previoustrend has since re-emerged.Reserves57.   There is little doubt that there are adequate reserves of oil in theground to meet rapidly growing consumption throughout the world.     The &quot;provedreserves&quot; (oil known to exist and to Le economically recoverable by presentmethods) of the non-communist world at the end of 1964 amounted to 35 times

O ,J oproduction in that year (ever 60 per cent of the reserves being in the middle east).   Looking ahead, the industry is confident that additional reserves willbe proved as needed.   New resources of oil are continually being discovered and large areas that are potentially oil-bearing remain to be explored.    Provedreserves will also be increased by the development of improved techniques of recovery.   Natural gas will increasingly supplement oil, and the current gasreserves of the non-communist world have been estimated as being equivalent toabout one-third of the proved oil reserves.    In addition, there are vastreserves, estimated at seven times the proved oil reserves of the non-communistworld, in the shale oil deposits in the United States and in the Athabasca andSouth American tar sands.   There is thus little risk of oil suddenly runningjut.   What may happen eventually is that prices will rise as exploration and recovery become more difficult and expensive.Security of Supply and Balance of Payments58.   Although reserves are adequate, reliance on imported oil, the bulk of which comes from one area - the Middle bast - inevitably involves some risk ofinterruption to supplies and has balance of payments implications.    On presentprospects, the declared value of retained imports (i.e. imports of crude oil and products less exports) is likely to rise from about  1+S1+ million in 1964 to something over  600 million in 1970.   These figures provide no guide to the netoutflow of foreign exchange, and the charge on the balance of payments is considerably less;    in particular, the cost of imports is substantially offset by the overseas earnings of the oil companies in which there is a British interest.The British Petroleum Co. Ltd. and the Rcyal Dutch/Shell group together account for about one-third of the international trade in crude oil and products.Their sales abroad, which are nearly five times as big as the United Kingdom&apos;soil consumption, bring the country substantial invisible earnings.Policy for Oil59.   From the beginning of the centuryoil has played a major part in advancingtechnology.    Motor cars, aeroplanes and modern ships all depend on oil.Recent examples of the contribution of oil to advancing technology are thedevelopment   of petro-chemicals, the new oil-based processes for gas making and improvements in techniques of iron making by the inj3 ction of fuel oil into

3 K Rii ejl o&apos;production in that year (ever 60 per cent of the reserves being in the Middle^East).   Looking ahead, the industry is confident that additional reserves willbe proved as needed.   New resources of oil are continually being discovered and large areas that are potentially oil-bearing remain to be explored.    Prwvedreserves will also be increased by the development of improved techniques cfrecovery.   Natural gas will increasingly supplement oil, and the current gasreserves of the non-communist world have been estimated as being equivalent toabout one-third of the proved oil reserves.    In addition, there are vastreserves, estimated at seven times the proved oil reserves of the non-communistworld, in the shale oil deposits in the United States and in the Athabasca andSouth American tar sands.    There is thus little risk of oil suddenly runningtut.   What may happen eventually is that prices will rise as exploration and recovery become more difficult and expensive.Security of Supply and Balance of Payments58.   Although reserves are adequate, reliance on imported oil, the bulk of which comes from one area - the Middle East - inevitably involves some risk ofinterruption to supplies and has balance of payments implications.   On presentprospects, the declared value of retained imports (i.e. imports of crude oil and products less exports) is likely to rise from about  484 million in 19&amp;4 ^0something over  600 million in 1970.   These figures provide no guide to the netoutflow of foreign exchange, and the charge on the balance of payments is considerably less;    in particular, the cost of imports is substantially offset by the overseas earnings cf the oil companies in which there is a British interest.The British Petroleum Co. Ltd. and the Rcyal Dutch/Shell group together account for about one-third of the international trade in crude oil and products.Their sales abroad, which are nearly five times as big as the United Kingdom&apos;soil consumption, bring the country substantial invisible earnings.Policy for Oil59.   From the beginning of the century oil has played a major part in advancingtechnology.   Motor cars, aeroplanes and modern ships all depend on oil.Recent examples of the contribution of oil to advancing technology are thedevelopment   of petro-chemicals, the new oil-based processes for gas making and improvements in techniques of iron making by the inj3 ction of fuel oil into

tlast furnaces. Leaving asids the uses for which oil is virtually irreplaceable,Ij^due curtailment of oil use for other purposes, for which alternatives areavailable, would increase costs in the economy generally.     It would affect thebalance of refinery operations and the willingness of the oil cd mpanies to invest in refinery development in the United Kingdom. -  la an advanced industrialeconomy there are thus limits to the extent to which reliance on imported oilcan in practice be diminished.(a) Stockpiling and Diversificationcp.   The risks of relying on imported oil can be mitigated by stockpiling and by drawing oil from diverse sources.     The Council of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D.) has recommended to European member countries a programme of stockpiling designed to create a base sufficient topermit the switching of oil supply sources in a wide range of circumstances.This programme has been put into effect and it is the Government&apos;s policy toensure that an adequate level of stocks is maintained in this country.     the oil companies are constantly trying to locate and develop new sources.     Theyhave had some success (e.g. in Libya, and Nigeria) but this country will probablyremain largely dependent on imports from the Middle East in, the 1970s.     TheGovernment looks to the companies to continue their efforts to diversifysupplies.     Substantial discoveries of oil or ga.s in the North Sea would, ofcourse, improve the security of our supplies, and the Government is taking thenecessary measures to ensure that exploration is vigorously pursued,(b) Imports61.   It is the policy of the Government to permit imports of crude oil and products from the non-communist world without discrimination between companies orsources of supply.     Although discrimination in favour of oil imported by companies in which there is a British interest might assist the balance ofpayments, it would be contrary to our international obligations and general commercial policy.     For similar reasons the Government1 s import policy does notdiscriminate between imported products and products from United Kingdom refineries,but this policy will be kept under review in the light of the practices of othercountries and progress towards adequate refinery capacity in Britain.

(c)    Home Refining62. A major contribution to keeping down the cost of oil imports can be madeby home refining. On average the value of refined products imported into theUnited Kingdom is nearly  3 a ton higher than the value of the crude oil fromwhich the products are refined. Moreover, home refining has other advantages in the. national interest. It avoids dependence on refineries in foreigncountries and so promotes security of supply: it attracts foreign investment and orders for plant: its growth stimulates the development of secondaryindustry based on it. About 40^? of proposed refining capacity is to be sitedin and near development districts.63.    It is not practicable to balance precisely the output of United Kingdomrefineries with inland consumption, bunkers and exports,  so as to make import of products unnecessary.    Some imports are linked to exports and result fromthe balancing of supply and demand for different products in different countries by the oil companies.    Some special products are not yet producedhere.    Companies starting in the United Kingdom market have to import until their trade is large enough to justify refining in this country.    TheGovernment has, however, adopted the objective that home refining should suffice to cover inland demand and bunkers in total.   This should help toensure that the proceeds of product exports are generally more thansufficient to cover the cost of product imports.64.    In &quot;1 964 home refining did not even cover inland demand,  but this shouldbe corrected as new refinery capacity recently commissioned or on ordercomes on stream.   Plans for refinery construction which have been notified to the Ministry of Power will, when fully implemented, bring capacity upto 102 million tons in 1970 (giving an output of products of about 92million tons).    In practice, further additions are likely before 1 970from certain companies which have not yet completed their plans.    the oil industry&apos;s estimate cf refinery output in that year is 97 million tons, compared   with an estimated   demand   (inland and   bunkers)32.

^93 million tons.     The objective should therefore be achieved at least until^yOo    Moreover, the implementation of these plans will spread refinery capacityQ0re widely between companies, including European   as well as American ovmedconcerns.     This will powerfully reinforce the recent move towards increasedcompetition in the United Kingdom market, by adding to the number of companiesiiich are firmly established here,,gj,  To maintain the objective, there will be a need for more refining capacityconing into operation at intervals after 1970.     The Government mil press the oil companies to provide this capacity and-, in  particular, will expect newcomers to theifcited Kingdom market to refine here as soor. as their share of the trade canjustify doing so, either alone or in combination with others -Conclusion65,  A continual rapid growth in oil consumption is likely for many years to come.This growth carries with it risks to security of supply and increasing directcosts to the balance of payments, but any undue restrictions on the use of oily/would  hinder technological advance and increase costs.     The Government believes that it is in the national interest   to accept a rapid growth in the use of oilbut will take measures to mitigate the security and balance of paymentsdisadvantages by ensuring adequate stocks in this country and by encouraging the oil companies to diversify their sources of supply and to develop the UnitedKingdom refinery industry.     It is also talcing steps to ensure that explorationfor oil and natural gas deposits in the North Sea. is vigorously pursued, for fewdevelopments could be of more benefit to the national economy than the discoveryof major reserves within To Itish jurisdiction-.33-

CONFIDENTIAL ,        ^ P nVIII.   NUCLEAR POThR67.   Nuclear power has now been established as a reliable means of generatingelectricity on a commercial scale.   It is characterised by high capital costs and low running costs;    this means that nuclear stations, once built, must be operated at the highest possible load factor to get the full economic benefit from them.   The uranium or thorium needed to produce the fuel for nuclearstations is not mined in the United Kingdom and therefore has to be imported.The foreign exchange cost depends on the form in which the fuel is imported,but is substantially less, per ton of coal equivalent, than the foreign exchange cost of imported oil.    The fact that uranium deposits are widely scatteredthroughout the world, the highly-concentrated nature of the fuel and the factthat a nuclear station, once fuelled, needs only relatively infrequentre-fuelling, combine to make nuclear power relatively immune to interruptions ofsupply by events overseas.   Both from the point of view of the balance ofpayments and from that of security of supply, therefore, nuclear power standscloser to home-produced coal than to imported oil.68.   Although the earlier expectations about the economics of nuclear power have proved premature, there has been a steady fall in the capital costs of successivestations in the first nuclear power programme, and the tender (an Advanced fras-cooled Reactor - A.G.R.) recently accepted for the second nuclear station atDungeness (1,200 Mr/) suggests that it  should give cheaper base-load electricitythan future coal-fired stations on the present price of power station coal.Total generating costs from the second Dungeness station are estimated, on cautiousassumptions, to be about 0.46d,/kWh (in terms of to-day1 s money values).    Thiscalculation is based on the discount rate of 7^ per cent used by the central electricity Generating Board for the appraisal of investment, and on a 75 per centload factor and a 2^-year life.   However, all components have been designed tohave a life of 30 years at 85 per cent load factor, and these more optimisticassumptions would lead to an estimate of about 0.38d./kWh.   These figures can be compared with costs from the coal-fired stations under construction or plannedat Drax (4,000 W) and Cottam (2,.CO0 Mil) of 0.52d. and 0.54d./kWh respectivelyand from the oil-fired station under construction at Pembroke (2,000 Mff) of1.52d./Wh, or 0..41d./kWh without tax.34.

69.   In the light of the anoouragins  tenders received for the second nuclearpoi er station to be built at Dungeness, the Government has reviewed the nuclear power programme for the six years 1970-75 given in the 7/hite Paper onthe Second Nuclear Peer Programme (Cmnd.2335) issued in April, 1964*70.   In agreement with the electricity supply industry and the UnitedKingdom Atomic Energy Authority, the Government has decided that for planning purposes it should be assumed that on average over the six ye rs 1970-75 about one nuclear power station a year would be commissioned, storting in 1 970 withthe Dungeness &apos;B&apos; station of 1,200 Mvv&apos;, and possibly including a secondScottish station.     The programme will be b sed on the Advanced Gas-cooledReactor developed by the Atomic Anergy Authority, but at this stage thepossibility of another reactor type making a contribution is not excluded.It is estimated that on these assumptions, and with further developments innuclear technology and expected increases in the size of stations, a total of8,000 MY7 might be in commission und^r the second nuclear power programme by1975.71 *   The nuclear programme will, therefore,flexible and subject to review in the light of neis information, including developments innuclear and other methods of electricity generation.

- oIX-    SECONDARY FUELS72.   Electricity and gas (l) - the main secondary fuels - account for an increasing proportion of our total energy consumption.    On most bases of comparison, the electricity industry is much the bigger of the two.    Of allthe primary fuel used in 1964,29^ went to power stations and Sf. to gas works.The investment requirements of the electricity industry - over  700 million in 1965 - are roughly five times as great as the gas industry&apos;s;    and itsturnover - around /1,000 million - is twice as large.    The two industriescompete with each other for many uses but by no means all.    About one half ofelectricity sold is for lighting, power and other specialised purposes forwhich, in practice, no other fuel is a substitute.   Electricity and gasalso compete with oil and solid fuel in direct use.Characteristics of the Electricity and Gas Industries73.   In general, electricity cannot be stored and capacity should, therefore,be available to generate and transmit power when it is wanted.    the relationship between the total amount of plant which has to be provided tomeet peak loads, and average consumption throughout the year, is important for the economics of the industry.    The extra demand at the peak is metmainly by old power stations, whose capital costs have been largely written off, or by special plant with low capital costs,  such as gas turbines.   Butthough these involve lower capital costs than new power stations of the usualtype, their running costs are higher.   In addition, peak loads affect thecapital costs of the distribution system.    On the other hand, the increasinguse of electricity at off-peak periods, e.g. by storage heaters, is likelyto improve the load factor.    Thus the time of day, and to a lesser extent the season of the year, at which the consumer makes his demand,  significantlyaffect the costs of supplying him.74.   The gas industry on the other hand is much less affected by peak demands.The capital cost of the plant is lower - very much so in the case of the newcil-based processes.    To meet hour-to-hour and day-to-day variations in(1)   All f igures given here relate to the public supply Industries.Electricity is also produced by industrial concerns for their own use and some of the gas produced at coke evens and at blast furnaces is supplied direct to steelworks, etc.36

CONFIDENTIAL ,        g gdemand, gas can be stored economically in traditional gas-holders or the pressure in the main canbe varied; and underground storage - for which provision has been made in the &amp;as Act, 1965 - should help the industry tcmeet seasonal variations which are becoming greater with the growth of the seasonal heating load.The Framework of Secondary Fuels Policy75.   The framework of statutory, administrative and financial.measureswithin which the two industries operate &apos; as been broadly the same for both,but there are some important differences.   First, the electricity industry has been subject to Government influence to adjust Its choice of primaryfuels in the light of wider national considerations.   Thus, when coal wasscarce, it increased its use of oil, and later,, as the market for coal has declined, it has favoured coal when oil would have been cheaper; also, it hasbuilt nuclear power stations before they were competitive.   The gas industry,on the other hand, has in recent years been allowed substantial freedom to choose whatever raw material it was able to use.   Secondly, there is uneventreatment in the taxation field: the imports of Algerian methane by the gas industry are not subject to duty and the oil feed-stocks of the gas industry donot bear the 2x. a gallon duty on burning oils, which is borne by theelectricity industry; on the other hand electrical storage heaters are exempt from the purchase tax, which applies to gas-heaters (as well as other electricalheaters).   Thirdly, the gas industry&apos;s present financial objectives are lower thanthese for the electricity industry.   Finally, electricity carries specialobligations in respect of rural electrification.   So, under the present arrangements, gas receives preferential treatment as compared with electricity.76.   The chief justification for maintaining these preferences has been inthe desirability of sustaining the gas industry and its system through a transitional period, a.nd in anticipation of the advantages to the community of expected economies in capital and current costs of production of fuel.The new low-cost processes for making gas from oil, the prospect of natural gas, and the improvements in space-heating appliances account for the markedadvance in gas sales in the last two years.   Sales of gas are expected toincrease rapidly, even without any discoveries of natural gas on theContinental Shelf - and faster still if worth-while discoveries are made.

The electricity industry has, throughout the past fifteen years, been facedwith a huge expansion of demand, calling for very heavy capital investment;and the prospects are that sales of electricity will continue to riserapidly.    Both industries, therefore, are expecting a period tf expandingsales and it is against the background cf these prospects that the Governmenthas examined policies affecting the- two industries.Primary Fuel Use - Gas77.    In 1964, gas works used 20.5 million tons of ccal and 5.0 million tonscoal equivalent of oil.    The industry also bcught coke oven gas (ever million tons ct-al equivalent) and a small amount cf methane, (natural gas) .The gas industry, in asscciaticn with the National Ccal Board and with theenccuragement of the Government, is engaged in research on the possibilitiesof eventually developing new, economic processes of making cheap gas from coal.   But any such possibilities are beyond the range cf policies that canbe shaped now.   The forecasts given in Table 1+ shew that the gas industryexpects that its use of ccal will have fallen to 10 m. tons by 1970.    Theimmediate issue is whether this trend away from ccal is desirable fcr the economy as a whole.   The new oil-based processes,   with lower capital and running costs, produce gas at abc ut half the- cost of the eld carbonisationprocesses, and are substantially cheaper than the new ccal processes suchas Lurgi.    It is in general mere eccnomical tc substitute oil for ccal inthis field than in other uses,  e.g.  steam-raising,    &quot;&quot;he economic penaltiesof reversing the trend are therefore large.    It is admittedly a drawback thatthe oil on which these new processes depend has to be imported.   But theuse of oils and refinery gases by the gas industry is ccmplementary tc thedevelopment and economical running of eur home oil refining industry, whichcan be expected to prcvide the bulk of the supplies required.   The gas industry can use a variety of petrt petroleum  products, including some   that havebeen in surplus frcm time tc- time, and is conducting research to extend the range still further.    This flexibility serves te reduce any increase in imports directly attributable te gas manufacture and would prevent theindustry becoming dependent on any one petroleum product.    Thus gas38

manufacture by these means is unlikely to add significantly to our totalimport bill for oil.    In the light of these facts,  the Government is satisfied that the trend of the gas industry towards oil should be accepted.78.    This does not exclude the possibility that it might be in the national interest for the gas industry to assist the coal industry by adjusting,from year to year, the phasing of its retirements of coal plant when, asoccurred this year, it can be done at no great cost.    But such measures can have only a limited effect.    As part of the short-term measures to assistcoal (paragraph 18), the Gas Boards examined how far they could increase theirexpected coal consumption in 1 965/66 and it now seems likely that they will use an additional 300,000 tons.    This reflects not only modifications inplant programmes but also increased estimates of gas demand.    But measuresto influence coal consumption by the gas industry (other than strictly limited adjustments from year to year) would involve a heavy economic penaltyand v/ould not be in the interests of the economy as a v/hole.79-    Possibly the most significant development for the gas industry over thenext ten years will be in the use of natural gas either as a feedstock for manufacture into town gas,  or for supplying direct to consumers in itsnatural state,    &quot;&quot;his high quality fuel has been of great economic value toall countries with ready access to it.    The scheme now in operation for importing Saharan gas in refrigerated tankers will bring in about 350 milliontherms a year (l0 per cent of current gas consumption).    There are large gasfields in Holland, Nigeria and elsewhere, which are other possible sources of imports;    and gas may be found under the British part of the continental shelf.   Because of the uncertainties,  however - economic, commercial orphysical - which attach to these other possible sources of natural gas, no allowance has been made for such developments in the forecasts inSection IV.80.   Decisions on the greater use of natural gas by the gas industry cannotbe made until there are firm proposals for the import of a specific quantityfrom a particular source.    Proposals for bringing additional gas from abroadv/ould be subject to Ministerial consent.   They would have to be critically39

CONFIDENTIAL ,        ^ p p3 o oexamined with reference, among other things, to the balance of payments costs and the possibility of indigenous supplies becoming available.    If largequantities of gas become available from the Continental Shelf, a well developedgas industry will provide a means of using these resources quickly and economi-cally; and the Minister sf Power has powers to regulate disposals if this were needed to maintain the orderly development of tho country&apos;s fuel economy.Primary Fuel Use - Electricity81.   Electricity is produced from three main sources: coal, which in 1964aciounted for 82 per cent of the total fuel used: oil, 12 per cent; and nuclear, 4 per cent.   The rest is mainly hydro-electricity.   The technology ofelectricity production can be expected to show continued improvements.    Thereshould be further progress in conventional generation and distribution, thoughcost reductions on the scale of those made since 1950 cannot be expected in thefuture; and nuclear power is likely to become fully competitive with conventionalelectricity generation (see paragraphs 24 and 68).   Looking even further ahead,nethods of direct production of electricity - such as magneto-hydro-dynamic(M.H.D.) generation - may also be developed.   As explained in paragraphs 69 to71, the extent of the expansion of nuclear power up to 1970 has already been determined;    and the programme for the five years following has now been settled for planning purposes.   Two oil burning power stations are now in course of construction and these aooount for the expected rise in oil consumption at power stations shown in Table.4.82.   In determining the balance between coal and oil at power stations, there are different considerations from those which apply to gas.    There are some power station sites where coal is economic.   Electricity generation is one of the most effective ways of using the small coals which can be praduced cheaply by mechinisation-cal means.    There is a strong inter-dependence between the two industries.    N*tonly dees the majority of electricity produced come from coal, but electricityis c*al&apos;s largest customer - in I964 taking 35 per cent of the National coal board&apos;s output.    The c*al industry must envisage that an increasing proportion ofits production will go to electricity.   For its part, the electricity industry must be^0

largely reliant on its coal-fired stations for many years;    and one consequenceof this is that it could be exposed to bearing a large part of any additionalcosts falling on the coal industry as a result of under-utilisation of miningcapacity.     Thus, having regard to its aim of producing electricity aseconomically as possible, the electricity industry has a strong practicalinterest, when planning its own development, in looking to the well-being of the coal industry.     As part of the short-term measures to assist the coalindustry in 1965/66, the electricity industry agreed to adjust the operationof its present power stations so as to give coal a degree of preference overoil (paragraphs 18 and 5l).83.   The Government has considered policy for oil and coal use both in existing power stations and in new ones.     In addition tc the considerationsoutlined above, the Government has had regard to the importance of securityof fuel supply for the electricity industry and the need to minimise foreign exchange costs.     As regards existing power stations and those under construction, the Government intends (as indicated in paragraph 51) toexamine, from year to year, the case for continuing to accord preferential treatment to coal.     Account will be taken of the coal supply position and theextent to which over-production may be unavoidable.     As regards new power stations, each proposal will be dealt with on its merits.     The case for some new oil-fired stations may be overwhelming because of siting requirements or because of the prospect of very large economies.     But in the light of theheavy task of contraction which faces coal, the emergence of nuclear power as a serious competitor both of coal and oil, and the inevitable inter-dependence of coal and electricity, proposals to build oil-fired stations in future will receive special scrutiny.84.   The Government is convinced that the inter-dependence of the coal and electricity industries calls for the gradual development of more far-reaching and more enduring arrangements under which both industries would recognise a responsibility for the scale and nature of the provision ofcoal supplies for electricity and the investment in both industries would be41.

more closely co-ordinated.    Some steps have already been taken.    One part-time member is common to both the National Coal Board and the central electricity Generating Board.    Close arrangements already exist between thetwo industries for discussing coal requirements in the short and the longterm;    and at the request of the Minister of Power the two industries arejointly to conduct operational research into ways of optimising the flow ofcoal to power stations.    It is expected that as coal1s markets become centredmore and more on electricity, the links and the need for co-operation will grow.    The two industries, on the suggestion of the Minister of Power, are toexamine how best this wider co-ordination should be developed.Primary Fuel Taxation85.   Allied to the question of primary fuel use is that of the taxation of primary fuels.    Oil used in the new gas-making processes is treated for tax purposes in the same way as oil used as a raw material for the manufactureof chemicals and does net, therefore, bear the duty cf 2d. a gallon on heavy and light oils used for burning.    The gas industry receives through itsexemption from this duty some advantage over electricity and considerable advantage over oil used directly as fuel.   Moreover, methane,  such as is nowbeing brought in from Algeria,  is not subject to the 10 per cent, tariffpayable on other imported gaseous hydrocarbons.86.   These preferences accorded to the gas industry are anomalous inprinciple.    In practice, the exemption from the. 2d. per gallon duty is unlikely greatly to distort the pattern of the energy market;    the oil dutyborne by the electricity industry is a small part of its total expenditure,though this Is not a measure of the full cost.    Moreover, it seems that gasmade from oil will, when the processes are established, be competitive withoil (even untaxed) for many purposes, particularly small scale industrialuses and domestic use.    Nevertheless, the position needs to be kept underreview and the Minister cf Power has advised the industry that its plans for investment and expansion in the longer term ought not to assume the continuation of these preferences.   Apart from fiscal considerations, it willbe necessary to take into account the rate of progress of the gas industry42

** R Uii vP win establishing the change-over tc the new processes which should give it amore assured economic and financial basis,   The exempticn from duty of imported methane will also need tc. be reviewed, perhaps when there is semefirm knowledge about the potential supplies from the British part of theNorth Sea Continental Shelf.Investment and Financial Objectivej;87.   The growth in sales foreseen implies a very high level of investment(the. details of which have been published in the National Flan) .   Therequirements of the capital-intensive electricity industry will be particularly heavy.    The industry&apos;s total capital expenditure at presentthroughout G-reat Britain is estimated to be about 10 per cent, of thecountry&apos;s gross fixed capital formation.   It does not follow from the scale of the industry&apos;s investment and of its borrowing from the Exchequer that itsgrowth should be curbed.    Because the continuous rapid increase in demand forthe product scon overtakes any over-provision of capacity, it offers a relatively safe, as well as profitable, field fcr investment.   However, thereis clearly a need to guard, as far as practicable, against the possibility ofover-investing.    Premature investment, especially at a time of strain on capital resources, is a real burden and avoidance of it is a function of theannual capital investment reviews.    Over-stimulation of demand throughuneconomic pricing provides another possible cause of   misallecation cf thecountry&apos;s resources.   Against this danger, insistence that the return on theindustry&apos;s capital should be adequate, and that the prices for any service should cover the full cost, including full capital charges of providing it,should provide sufficient safeguards.    Hence the importance of financial objectives and of proper criteria, for new investment for the nationalised industries.88.   If any restrictions -were to be placed on the industry&apos;s growth, theyshould impinge on the growth of demand as well as of supply, and should avoidprolonging or worsening present strains on generating and distributingcapacity.   As explained in paragraph 23, the electricity industry is stillhard pressed to meet peak demands.    It has had nothing in reserve to meetA3

9 ftd illabnormally cold weather.   It is the G-ovcrnment&apos; s policy that the deficiency^should be remedied as soon as practicable, and this will be done progressivelywith the help of the new plant now under construction and due to be introduced inthe next two years.89.     One sector of demand which it might be thought desirable to curb is thatfor soace heating by direct-acting appliances ^ because of the high costs tothe economy which are generally involved, compared with other forms of spaceheating.   The Gtvernment believes, however, that the solution to this problemlies in an appropriate tariff policy (see paragraphs 9&apos;:- and 95 below).90.    Under the present arrangements, which cover the five years up to March,1967, the gas industry has been given generally lower financial objectivesthan electricity.   The difference in the objectives reflects, in part, thedifference in the expected ability of the industries, at the time the objectives ?/ere agreed, to earn surpluses; and in this respect, the gas industry derives a further degree of preferential treatment.   But the netreturn on capital in the gas industry, over a period of time, ought to be no less than in the electricity industry.   The gas industry has needed time to free itself from the old style plant which could not be made to pay its wayfully and to make the transition to the new style plant which can earn a highreturn on capital invested.    But with the present growth prospects of the gas industry, and with increasing supplies coming from new processes, the presentdifferentiation is becoming increasingly out of date.   Progressive assimilationof the financial objectives for the two industries is envisaged, aid the gas industry has accordingly been advised to expect an increase in its finencialobjective for the next period.Fuel Supplies for Clean Air91.     The decline in the use of carbonisation for gas manufacture means thatthe gas industry will produce less coke; this has implications for the implementation of the Government&apos;s clean air policy.   The Government,however, believes that this policy can and should go forv/ard on the basis offuels which can be supplied economically.   The White Paper on Domestic fuel supplies and the Clean Air Policy published in December 1963 (Cmnd. 2231)/ i.e. those which consume electricity at the same time as they give outheat, as opposed to those which store heat and give it out later.44

Oil/ft suggested that, in the absence of appropriate measures, open-grate smokelessfuels in tne years up to 197* would be jnadequate to meet the growing demand,and recommended action by the producers to bring supply and demand into betterbalance.   Although supplies of solid smokeless fuels from the gas industry aredecreasing, the National Coal Board and private producers have since announcedplans to make substantial increases in the production of open-grate premiumfuels;   the Board also expects to increase the availability of hard coke foruse in domestic closed appliances up to the level forecast in the White Paper.In addition there are plentiful supplies of non-solid smokeless fuels - gas,off-peak electricity and oil.  All these together should be fully sufficient tomaintain progress with the clean air policy.SPECIFIC FACTORS IN THE INTSR-RSLATIONSHIP ^^TjggLSHS GAS AND ELECTRICITYINDUSTRIES92.   In addition to the general framework within which the industries should operate, there are other areas of particular importance involving either elements of competition between the two industries or scope for co-operation between them,(i) Tariffs93-   It is the Government&apos;s policy that, in general, the industries&apos; tariffsshould provide revenue sufficient to cover the full accounting costs of theindustry including overheads and the surplus needed to achieve the agreedfinancial objectives.    This policy helps to maintain financial discipline, actsas a spur to efficiency in the industries and avoids the danger to morale and efficiency which can result from an industry&apos;s running a continuing deficit.   Itis also desirable that as far as practicable, the tariffs charged to each classof consumer, or for each load, should cover at least the long-term avoidablecosts of supplying the class or covering the load plus an appropriate share ofoverheads.   The appropriate addition is not necessarily a fixed percentage forall loads and groups of consumers, but should take into account other factors,including the actual share of overheads attributable to that load or group (in sofar as this can be estimated), the Boa.rd&apos;s commercial judgment about the effectof varying tariff patterns, and wider economic considerations.   In the past ithas appeared that electricity tariffs had the effect of charging industrial and commercial consumers a bigger margin for overheads than domestic consumers.   Thereare arguments against this.   In order to assist the modernisation a.nd expansion ofindustry, it is important -that the price of electricity to industry should bekept as low as is consistent with the considerations mentioned above.    The Government,therefore, endorsed the recent policy of the electricity industry of concentratingunavoidable increases in prices on the unit rate in domestic tariffs.45CONFIDENTIAL

%.    Space-heating by direct-acting electric appliances raises a special problem.    Space-heating provides one cf the main fields of competition between gas and electricity, but this use is one where the justification for electricity has been questioned.    Direct-acting electric space-heatingaccentuates the peak load and is a more expensive demand to meet - especially interms of capital costs - than space-heating by gas.    The direct-actingelectric appliances are cheap to buy and have attractions of flexibility and convenience especially when used for occasional heating.   The consumer shouldbe able to opt fcr these attractions,  but his choice should be made on thebasis of tariffs which reflect the full cost of satisfying his preference.95.   At present, it seems that the running rates of domestic two-part gastariffs do generally cover the prospective marginal costs for space heating.In the case of electricity, it appears that the running rates of domestictariffs amply cover the marginal cost of electricity to domestic users forall purposes taken together, but barely cover the cost of supply for directspace-heating alone.   The much lower marginal cost of supplying night storageappliances,  on the other hand, appears to be adequately covered by the relevant tariffs.    The electricity industry, with the Government&apos;sencouragement, is experimenting with new types of tariff that  can reflectmore accurately the costs of the different kinds of domestic use;    but whileit may be possible to devise more flexible, tariffs, it may be found that the extra cost of the special metering equipment invclved -would outweigh the savings which would arise from the improvement cf load factor in thesupply system.   In the meantime, the industry should ccntinue to encourage theuse of storage heaters (see also paragraph 73);    and electricity tariffsshould take full account of the extra cost to the economy of using direct-acting electric space-heaters instead of other means of heating.(ii)    Amenity Considerations96.   The impact of the two industries on visual and other amenities is different.   With gas,  surface holders, which are likely to be a necessary46

t* adjunct of gas supply for years to come, are unsightly;    but manufacturingplants are relatively small and emit virtually no sulphur into the atmosphere-phere, and supplies are delivered by underground pipes.     With electricity,the size cf power stations and the spread of the grid give rise to increasingconcern.     Under the-Electricity Act,T?57, -both the industry; ingputting forwardproposo-ls, and the Minister of Power in considering them, are required tohave regard to their effect on amenity, and a balance has to be struckbetween this obligation and the industry&quot;s duty to provide an economicalsupply.     To preserve amenities, the industry may have to incur greaterexpenditure to reduce pollution from sulphur emissions;   and may have to spend even greater sums than now on using underground cables, which can be atpresent up to twenty times as expensive as overhead lines.    The Governmentis encoura.ging the research efforts of the electricity industry and cablemanufacturers to reduce the cost of underground transmission.   meanwhile the statutory procedures providing for Ministerial consents for power stations and overhead lines have to be operated on the basis of current costs.In considering, therefore, the balance of all the factors affecting the twoindustries, it must not be overlooked that the preservation of amenityimposes extra, costs on the electricity industry and hinders the task of meeting the expanding demand.(iii)   Rural Supplies97.   The electricity industry has been recognised to owe a greater obligationthan the gas industry to extend supplies to rural areas,  and this is reflected in the special statutory duty of the Electricity Boa.rds.     It is right that this burden should be on electricity rather than gas, becauseelectricity is needed in those a.reas for purposes for which gas is no substi-tuto.     It is, however, important to avoid the provision of two uneconomic andcompeting public supplies in the less populous areas where each may makethe situation of the other even mere uneconomic.     In general, gas supplies shouldbe--extended only where they would bo remunerative even without the preferencesthat the industry.,at present,enjoys-&apos;(sqo paragraph75): and uneconomic&apos;supplies

should be eliminated.   There is prima facie evidence of cases where boththe gas and electricity industries made losses on supplies to the samelocalities.   Where uneconomic investment has already been made, there is little that can be done until proposals arise for new or replacementdistribution facilities.    For the future, the Minister of Power vail keepthe activities of both industries in such areas under review in order toensure cooperation between them.(iv)    Initial Charges98.   There has for some time been growing concern at the possibility thatfair and open competition between gas and electricity might be distorted as aresult of the system under which, when new housing is connected to the mains,initial charges are sometimes made which may vary according to the standardof the wiring or piping installation, or with the type of equipmentinstalled by the developer.    The gas industry generally makes no suchcharge:    indeed,  some Boards are believed to subsidise the prevision of internalgas piping.   Host Electricity Boards, however,  when supplying local authority housing estates, make freedom from initial charges dependent en the builderproviding a certain number of power-points in the houses, and on his notinstalling, in advance of the consumer expressing his preference, certainkinds of appliances which would use other fuels than electricity.   The Boardsextend this also to privately-built houses.   The.two industries arecriticised by each other and the position is unsatisfactory for allconcerned.   The Government have therefore taken the view that the twoindustries ought to move towards an acceptable agreement.    Some progress hasbeen made, but   further discussions will be needed before revised arrangements can be settled.Conclusion, on Secondary Fuelj399.   The interests of the nation are best served by a policy towards the secondary fuel industries which combines the elements of competition andco-operation.   The nationalisation Acts set up separate enterprises in the expectation that there would be competition between them.    Such competition

49has yielded, and should continue to yield, a valuable stimulus to bothindustries.    Co-operation in some fields is also essential.    Some have beenoutlined above;    other possible areas - e.g. meter-reading and billing,service centres and showrooms, and advertising - have been examined from timeto time (notably by the Committee on Co-operation between Electricity and GasBeards under Sir Cecil Weir, which reported in 1 959 - Cmnd 695) hut thebalance of advantage has appeared to lie in leaving these within theresponsibility of each industry.    The scope for further co-operation will bekept under review.   Within the framework of the policy measures set out above,the part played by electricity and gas must be expected to increase, astechnological progress extends the applications in which these refined fuelshave inherent advantages.

X.CONCLUSIONvjOt    Much of the background to fuel policy which is set out in this white paper changes little from year to year.     The national interests which fueloolicy must seek to serve, and certain basic characteristics of the variousfuel industries, change slowly if at all.     But in other respects circumstances areare never constant.     This is an area markedly subject to technologicalinnovation, and the research and development efforts of the industries are continually opening up new opportunities and presenting new problems.     new sources of fuel supplies are being discovered and the   balance of costs between different fuels is continually changing.     These changes affect the relationships between the various industries and the way the interests of each industryconflict or harmonise with those of the others.     They also affect the nature and scale of the very heavy capital investment undertaken by the industries.101.    For all these reasons the framework of Government policy established bythis White Paper is not intended to be rigid.     In describing the policies which the Government will pursue, attention has already been drawn to the probableneed for future changes in policy.     These changes will be made at theappropriate time.     Other changes, not at present foreseeable, will nodoubt also become necessary,     With the advice and help of the Energy AdvisoryCouncil, the Government will keep fuel policy continually under review, sothat as circumstances change it can continue to promote the greatestcontribution by tho fuel industries to the we If are of the nation.50.
