THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1965C. (65) 12413th September, 1965Copy No.     6 6CABINETDISCLOSURE OF COMPANIES&apos; POLITICALCONTRIBUTIONSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Governments intention that companies should be requiredto disclose their political contributions was announced in the queen&apos;s Speech in the following terms:&quot; Action will be taken to require companies to disclosepolitical contributions in their accounts.&quot;2. In January the Ministerial Committee for economic development agreed that a provision requiring the disclosure ofpolitical contributions should be included in the Bill which was tobe drafted to give effect to recommendations made by the JenkinsCommittee about disclosure in company accounts generally.3. A complicated definition of political contributions isnecessary to ensure that disclosure is required of contributions notonly to political parties but also to bodies such as Aims for industry Ltd. In the course of preparing the Bill my officials have consulted the Board of Trade&apos;s Accountancy Advisory Committee,under the chairmanship of Sir Thomas Robson of Price Waterhouse,on various matters arising out of the Bill. The Committee said thatit would be unreasonable to require auditors to take responsibilityfor the figures for political contributions given by the directors since this could involve the auditors in checking every single item of thecompany&apos;s expenditure. Where there were contributions to bodieslike Aims for Industry Ltd., it would also require them to judge whether the bodies fell within the definition as persons carrying on,or proposing to carry on, any activity which could reasonably beregarded as likely to affect public support for a political party, andwhether the directors knew that the bodies to which they weresubscribing fell within the definition. The Committee accordingly suggested that a company should be required to give information about its political contributions not in its accounts but in its directors&apos;report. This report has to be attached to the accounts, but is not oneof the documents On which the auditors have to report to themembers.6099
4. I consider the Advisory Committee&apos;s reasons for not involving the auditors to be valid, and accept their advice; but i thought it right to bring this small change in the intention announced in The Queen&apos;s Speech to the notice of the Cabinet.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S.W.1,10th September, 1965.
