5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 136 COPY NO.I) U19th October, 1965CABINETROAD SAFETYMernorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Government are committed to making it an offence to driveor be in charge of a motor vehicle with more than a prescribed coneen-tration of alcohol in the blood.     The Governments intention, and hopethat it would be possible tc introduce a Bill before Christmas, was announced by the Minister of Transport in the debate on the SecondReading of Mr. Graham Page&apos;s Road Safety Bill on 18th June (official report, Col. 1119).     The fulfilment of this pledge raises difficult problems of enforcement.     The purpose of this paper is to put these problems before the Cabinet.The case for amending the lav/2,       The case for amending the law is that drink is an important,though not the main cause, of road accidents.    It is estimated that20, 000 to 35,000 casualties a year (5 to 9 per cent) are attributable toit.     The existing lav/, which makes it an offence to drive while the ability to do so is impaired by drink or drugs, is an ineffective safeguardbecause proof tarns mainly on the driver showing visible signs ofintoxication, and many drivers take sufficient alcohol to be unsafe onthe road without showing any such signs,3.       The Ministers concerned are consulting the Medical research council on the level of blood alcohol which should be prescribed.    TheBritish Medical Association have recommended 80mg. /lOOmi. (about pints of beer), which they consider tc be the level at which there canbe no doubt about the impairment of any individual&apos;s driving ability,irrespective of individual differences in ability to &quot;hold liquor&quot;.    but although this level is high enough to make a driver a potential danger,it will not usually produce erratic behaviour.    If we are to make anyimpact on the problem of drink and driving we must effect a change in public attitudes so that driving after taking more than a very moderateamount of alcohol is no longer socially tolerable.     This means applyingsanctions to drivers who, though a potential danger, do not consider themselves unfit to drive and show no symptoms of intoxication.Tests of blood alcohol level4.       It is possible to ascertain or assess the level of alcohol in the blood by chemical tests of blood, breath or uxdne.     To obtain thesespecimens it is necessary to take a driver to a police station and requirehim to supply a specimen under pain of penalties unless he can showi-a -

reasonable c ause for failure or refusal tc do so.    Since there mustbe no incentive tc a driver who thinks that his blood alcohol level may-be above a prescribed figure to defeat a prosecution by refusing togive a specimen, the penalties for unreasonable refusal must be thesame as those for the substantive offence, including disqualification.Police powers5.       The crucial question is: what extra powers is it necessary toconfer on the police to make enforcement effective?    At present thepolice can arrest drivers whom they suspect of having committed theexisting offences, that is drivers who show such signs of intoxicationthat they are clearly unfit to drive.     These drivers normally have a concentration of blood alcohol of more than 150mg. /100ml.    If thepolice are to detect those with a lower level, tiiey need powers toapply a screening test to drivers selected either (i) at random or (ii)because they are suspected on grounds other than erratic behaviour of having been drinking.    A screening test is available in the form ofa simplified breath testing device which can be used at the roadsideand will demonstrate a blood alcohol level above the prescribed figurewith sufficient accuracy to provide prima facie evidence of an offenceand so to justify requiring the person concerned to undergo the furthertest at a police station.1 &apos;Random tests&quot;6.       This would involve taking power to stop a vehicle at randomand require the driver to take the screening test.    It would be an offence punishable simply with a fine to refuse without reasonable cause to submit to the test.    Drivers who refused would normally besummonsed.     There would be no power of arrest unless there were grounds in addition to the refusal for suspecting that the driver hadbeen drinking.7.       The Ministers principally concerned believe that this method would produce the greatest deterrent effect.    It would have theadvantage of casting no slur on the driver who happened to be stopped,and although it would be opposed by the police as being likely to impairtheir relations with the motoring public and probably by some sectionsof public opinion, they would be likely to regard this as less open to objection than a selective test of the kind described below.    It mightbe thought oppressive that a driver who refused the screening test andwho was suspected of having taken alcohol cculd be arrested without any evidence that he was in fact unfit to drive, and if he then refused togive a specimen would be liable tc disqualification and imprisonment.A &quot;selective test&quot;8.       If this were adopted the police would be empowered to stop andtest a driver only if they had grounds for suspecting that he had takenadcohoi, e, g, because he was seen coming out of a public house orclub, was involved in an accident, or, being stopped for seme other reason, showed signs of drinking.

9.       This is a less drastic alternative than a &quot;random&quot; check, butit is open tc considerable objection.    Anybody seen coming out of apublic house would be liable to be stopped, although he might havetaken no alcohol;  and merely to be stopped might be damaging to adriver&apos;s reputation.      The check would appear to have a class biasbecause it would be applied mainly to drivers whose social drinkingnormally took place in public houses or clubs, and only rarely to thoseaccustomed to drinking in private houses.    It would expose the police to a suspicion of unfairness, since, in order to justify stopping adriver they would normally have to show that they had seen him comingaway from a public house or club, and hence that they were in a positionto select known individuals tc be stepped.     There is the further substantial technical difficulty that a breath test of a driver immediately on coming out of a public house or club might be misleading, since thetraces of alcohol remaining in the mouth for a quarter of an hour ortwenty minutes after drinking give a disproportionately high readings10.       If neither &quot;random&quot; nor &quot;selective&quot; checks were thoughtacceptable, the only alternative would be to confer no additional powerson the police at all, but to provide that the presence of more than theprescribed level of blood alcohol should be conclusive proof of thecommission of the existing offence of driving while the ability to do sois impaired by drink.    The Korne Affairs Committee rejected this onthe ground that it v/ould. not be regarded as an adequate fulfilment ofthe Governments pledges tc take effective action to deal with theproblem.    It might marginally increase the number of convictions forthe existing offences, but it would not deter the considerable numbercf unsafe drivers who are not within reach of the present law, nor would it be likely to effect any change in social habits.The conclusions of the Home Affairs Committee11.        The problem turns on an assessment of public reactions to ameasure conferring on the police increased powers to stop drivers.Since the measure would be designed in part to promote a change in public attitudes to driving after taking alcohol, it v/ould fail of its purpose if it created public resentment and stimulated public sympathy with drivers who were punished for driving or being in charge of a vehicle with more than the prescribed level of alcohol in the blood orfor refusing either the screening or the substantive test.     There is a risk that this might happen.     It is not certain that a Bill with provisionfor random checks v/ould be accepted in the House ox Commons.    Onthe other hand, Mr. Graham ?age&apos;s Bill attracted considerable support from all parties, and there is believed to be a growing demand inthe country for effective measures to protect the public against driverswho are unfit through drink.    A National Opinion Poll in August thisyear showed that S5 per cent of drivers were in favour of a statutoryblood alcohol level, and over 70 per cent thought the limit should beabout 80mg. /100ml.    &quot;v7e may therefore be strongly criticised if wedo not introduce an effective measure;  but the Bill would be contro-versia.1 and would provide opportunities to criticise us for seeking toconfer on the police powers to interfere with the liberty of ordinarypeople of a severity out of proportion to the importance of drink as a cause of accidents;,-3-

M *j St*a 3 312.       The Home Affairs Committee had some initial doubts, but after a lengthy discussion concluded that the balance of advantage layin creating new offences and empowering the police to impose&quot;random&quot; checks (K. (65) 23rd Meeting, Minute 5).Trial by jury13.       The proposals raise a subsidiary problem about the right totrial by jury.    A driver accused summarily of the existing offencehas a right to opt for trial by jury because the maximum penaltyincludes four months&apos; imprisonment.    Juries are notoriously lenienttowards drivers.    It is proposed that a driver charged with the newoffence should not be able to opt for trial by jury.    As a matter of drafting this would be effected by reducing the maximum penalty to three months&apos; imprisonment.14.       The withholding of the right to opt for trial by jury can bejustified in the case of fee offence of driving with a blood alcohol levelabove the prescribed figure, on the ground that the point at issue is whether the blood alcohol level has or has not been demonstrated by ascientific test to be above the prescribed amount, and that this is not an issue which a jury is particularly suitable to determine.    But thereare other issue.es, e. g. whether a test has been unreasonably refused,or, in the case of being in charge of a motor vehicle with a specifiedlevel of blood alcohol, the question whether the accused has estahlishedthe special defence which the law provides, i. e. that he had not drivenand did not intend to drive while in that condition.    These are issues of a kind which are suitable for a jury to determine.15.       The Home Affairs Committee thought that on balance it wouldbe right to reduce the maximum imprisonment to three months, andso withhold the right to jury trial, provided that this purpose wasfrankly acknowledged, but that the Government should show themselvesready to give way on the point if opinion in Parliament was against them.Conclusions16.      Questions on which decisions are required are:-(a) Do the Cabinet confirm that it is our policy to introduce early legislation to create offences of driving, attempting to drive, or being in charge of a motor vehicle with the blood alcohol level above a prescribed figure?(b) Should the police be given powers to stop motorists at randomand apply a screening test?(c) Should the maximum sentence of imprisonment on summary conviction of the new offences be three months, with the consequencethat the accused will have no right to opt for trial by jury?D.H.70, Whitehall, S.
