THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1965C. (65) 104 Copy No.     5 914th July, 1965CABINETELECTORAL REGISTER : FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartmentUnder present law one electoral register is published each year,on 15th February, related to residence in the constituency on the qualifying date of 10th October in the previous year. From 1918 to1926 there were two registers a year. The second register was thenabandoned as an economy measure. In 1946 the Oliver Committeeon Electoral Registration (Cmd. 7004) recommended a secondregister, stressing the importance of having as fresh a register aspossible for Parliamentary elections. The Representation of thePeople Act, 1948, provided accordingly. The timing was as follows:Spring RegisterQualifying date      ......      20th NovemberPublication   .........      15th MarchAutumn RegisterQualifying date      ......      15th JunePublication   .........      1st October2. In the following year the Electoral Registers Act, 1949,abolished the autumn register, again primarily on economic grounds.Another factor was that preparation of two registers a year had beenfound to place a heavy burden on the staffs of registration officersand on the printing industry. And a second register was considered to be less essential than hitherto in that a qualifying period of residence was no longer required and the postal vote was availableto those who moved from their qualifying address to an address ina different parish, urban district or borough.3. At the same time there were strong representations that the voting position of young persons becoming 21 before the qualifyingdate for the autumn register should not be worsened. Provision was accordingly made an the Electoral Registers Act, 1949, for personsbecoming 21 after 10th October (the qualifying date for the present5896
annual register) but before the following 15th June (the qualifyingdate for the abolished autumn register) to have their names in theregister marked with a &quot; Y &quot; and to be able to vote at elections heldafter 1st October (the date of operation of the abolished autumnregister).4. The main criticism of the existing arrangements is that a register compiled on the basis of a qualifying date of 10th October,which is four months out of date when it comes into use on16th February-a delay of this order is inevitable under any system-is up to 16 months out of date if it is used at an election heldearly in the following year. A sample survey carried out by theSocial Survey Division of the Central Office of Information in 1950showed that the register was just over 96 per cent accurate at the qualifying date and that it lost accuracy at the rate of \ per cent amonth. On these figures the register would be about 93^ per centaccurate on publication and 88 per cent accurate immediately beforethe publication of the ensuing register. Apart from deaths the deterioration in accuracy is due to removals, many of which canbe catered for by the absent voting provisions; but these involve a somewhat complicated procedure, and it is possible that many people who are eligible for an absent vote do not trouble to apply for it.5. A further criticism is that the special arrangement for themarking of &quot; Y &quot; voters see paragraph 3 above is complicated and that the law in this respect is not ideal. One effect of institutinga second annual register would be to remove the requirement forthis special arrangement; but if the minimum age for voting were tobe slightly lowered, it might not be thought necessary to retain thearrangement even if no second register were introduced.6. The cost of preparing one annual register is at present 2-8 million for the whole of the United Kingdom. The cost wouldbe almost doubled if a second annual register were to be restored.About half the cost is now met by the local authorities, since theregister is used for local government as well as parliamentary elections. But except for elections to fill casual vacancies, an autumnregister would be of no use for local government purposes; and forthis reason local authorities might expect the Exchequer to meetthe whole cost of preparing it.7. Representative electoral registration officers have recentlybeen consulted on the implications for them of a requirement toprepare and publish two registers each year. They pointed out thatthe canvass for and the preparation of a second register might haveto take place either during the period of local government electionsor in the early part of the holiday season. They did not considerhowever that there would be any insuperable difficulty.8. The question of a second annual register is not specifically mentioned in the terms of reference of the Speakers Conference.But the terms are sufficiently wide to allow the Conference to considerit, and I understand that they intend to do so. It is not known whenthe Conference will report they have announced 30th September
next as the final date for receiving evidence but they are unlikely to do so in time for their recommendations to be given effect in egislation to be promoted in the next session of Parliament.9. I understand that some of my colleagues favour theintroduction of a second register, and think that there may be acase for taking action on this in advance of the report of the speakers Conference. It is for this reason that I am raising thematter now.F. S.Home Office, S.W.1,13th July, 1965.
