DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 12227th August, 1965COPY NO.CABINETIMPORTS OF COTTON TEXTILESMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, in a minute of which a copy is annexed, proposes that I should make changes in thescheme for controlling imports of cotton textiles which I was about toput to the exporting countries.    To proceed with this scheme will, inhis opinion, have disastrous political consequences on our relations withPakistan.    My own view is that we should go ahead with presenting theplan.2.      My colleagues authorised me in May to prepare a scheme for regulating cotton textile imports from the developing countries.    Thiswas to consist of a global quota with provision, in addition, for countryquotas, all to be held within a total ceiling figure;  and I was asked tobear in mind the interests of India and Pakistan (C. C. (65) 30th Conclusions,Minute 4).    The Governments of both countries had expressed to meduring my visit to Asia a desire to talk to us before we formulated our proposals, and discussions with them and with Hong Kong took place inLondon in June.    India and Hong Rong made it clear that they would most strongly oppose any proposals which involved reducing their presentcountry quotas even if the global quota pool were correspondinglyincreased and they were given access to it.    They considered that,having accepted restraint since 1959, much of the growth of the UnitedKingdom imports since then had already been at their expense.    India,in particular, plainly felt that any reduction in her quota would involvea corresponding loss in her trade with us and a further deterioration ofher financial position.    This, because of the weakness of her competitive position, is almost certainly true.    Pakistan, on the other hand,regarded her country quota as wholly inadequate and urged a total globalquota with no country reservations.    Her modern machinery and exportincentive schemes would give her substantial advantages under suchconditions.3.       I accordingly decided upon a scheme which would fix a totalceiling for imports from developing countries based on the averagefigures for 1962/4 and which would give India and Hong Kong theirpresent country quotas and no access to the global quota, while allother supplying countries except Pakistan v/ould participate only in the global quota.    To Pakistan I proposed the option of retaining her existingcountry quota or of participating in the global quota.    Given that theobject of the exercise is to restrict our imports to the 1962/4 level, thisappears to me the maximum concession we could offer to Pakistan who is,in fact, demanding an increase in her exports to us which, with a fixedceiling, could only be at the expense of others.    After consultation withthe Commonwealth Relations Office, whose Minister of State expressed,but did not press, apprehensions about Pakistani reactions, and with the-1-

full support of the Colonial Secretary, the scheme was sent in draft forcomment to the three Commonwealth countries.    India and Hong Konghave given assent in principle.    Fakistan prefers the global quota butinsists that it should be increased by reductions in the country quotas ofthe other two.4.       The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations proposes thatPakistan should be conciliated and that the Indian and Hong Kong quotasshould be cut by 25 per cent;  that the global pool should be correspond-ingly increased; and that our plans should be presented to the exporting countries in this form.    I believe that if, within a few weeks of consulting India and Hong Kong, we present them with a scheme revisedsubstantially to their disadvantage and to the obvious benefit of Pakistan,we shall provoke the most violent reactions from India, and I understandthat the Colonial Secretary would regard the effect on Hong Kong asequally serious.    Nor do I believe that the global quota countries, mostof whom must pay duty on their cotton   textiles, would readily acceptproposals which still reserved more than half* of our imports to Indiaand Hong Kong while enabling those countries to compete freely in the global sector.    To present a plan of this kind in the teeth cf Indian and hong Kong opposition would put our negotiators in a.n impossible position.5.       I must emphasise that the proposals I wish to present constitute an initial negotiating position.    They would enable us to enter on discussions with hope of support from India and Hong Kong.    If, as ispossible, there is a general objection among the exporting countries tothe apparently privileged position of these two and it is necessary to seekconcessions from them, it will be clear that we are doing so as a resultof this general pressure and Paddstan will benefit a.s a result;  but weshall not appear to be making concessions to her alone.    I should alsolike to stress the urgency of this matter if the Government is not to appear both to foreign exporters and British importers to be intolerablydilator1/ in embarking on a settlement.6.      The issue to be decided, though it may be grave, is quite clear.I seek the guidance of my colleagues on whether to proceed with thepresent proposals with the risk of the reactions from Pa.kistan, whichthe Secretary of Sta.te for Commonwealth Relations fears, or whether toamend the proposals in the sense which he suggests, thereby incensingthe Indians and Hong Kong and, in my view, making our negotiating position with the exporting countries as a whole even more impossiblethan it already is.D.P. T. J.Board of Trade, S.W.1.26th August, 1965*0n the basis of the present proposals, the distribution of the importwould be:  India 195m.. sq. yds.:  Hong Kong 185m. sq. yds.; Globalquota 120m. sq. yds.    With 25 per cent from India and Hong hongtransferred to the&apos;global sector, the distribution would be India 146m. ;Hong liong 139m.;  Global sector 215m.- 2-

PRESIDENT OF THE 3CARD OF TRADECotton TextilesI ana sorry to see from your minute of 11th August to CledwynHughes that you do no.&apos;, see your way to accept the suggestion made inhis minute cf 9th August that what we should now propose to oursuppliers is that each of them should have a country quota equal to75 per cent of their existing quota and should compete for the balance in a global quota.2.       Pakistan would deeply resent it if the revision of our quotaarrangements does net give her an opportunity to compete againstIndia in our market tc the extent that Cledwyn Hughes1 proposal wouldinvolve.    The Pakistan Government feel not unreasonably that theexisting quotas were settled at a time when her industry wasadolescent.     They would particularly resent the circulation by us nowto all our developing suppliers of proposals which it will be known tohave been put to India., Pakistan and Hong Kong and have not provedacceptable to Pakistan.    It is j?akistan&apos;s jealousy of India which willembitter the controversy.3.       This comes at a particularly difficult moment in our relationswith Pakistan.     The United States Government have told us that therewill be no American pledge of aid to Pakistan when the PakistanConsortium meets on 23rd September unless President Ayub firstvisits President Johnson in the United States and in effect gives himassurances that the Pakistan Government will cease their presenthostile attitudes towards United States policies.    I am sendingSir Morrice James back from leave to -Pakistan this week in order to try to make the Pakistan Government realise the danger in which theylie and to explore the possibility of an accommodation between them andthe United States Government.    I fear Sir Morrice James&apos; delicatetask v/ould be much prejudiced if at the same time v/e precipitate arow between ourselves and Pakistan on cotton textiles.    If Americanaid is in fact cut off from Pakistan, there would be greatly increaseddanger of Pakistan moving towards an alignment with China and indonesia and there may be consequences for American aid to India.     The wholeWestern position in Southern Asia could be profoundly affected.4.      I recognise that India and Kong Kong would dislike a proposal that they should now get something less than 100 per cent of theirpresent quotas.    But the longer we continue to dangle the prospect of100 per cent before them, the more difficult it will be to withdraw theoffer.   In any case the row which v/e risk with Pakistan in presentcircumstances would be much graver and more dangerous than thatwhich we would risk with India and Hong Kong.    I cannot believe thatthe negotiation can be concluded on the basis of 100 per cent countryquota for India and Hong Kong with all others competing for a globalquota and this strengthens my anxiety to avoid a dangerous row withPakistan for what could not be more than a tactical advantage in thecotton textile negotiations.-3-

5.      As an alternative to Cledwyn Hughes&apos; suggestion, you may care to consider putting forward at this stage to all developing suppliers aproposal that India, Hong Kong and Pakistan should have country quotasequal to 75 per cent of their existing quotas and should compete, withother suppliers, for a global quota.    This would not be acceptable toMalaysia and Singapore and no doubt others, but it would get thenegotiations started on a general basis without the row I fear withPakistan.6.       I am copying this minute to the First Secretary of State, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary, the colonial secretary and the Minister of Overseas Development.A.G.B.25th August, 1965-4-
