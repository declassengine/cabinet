*? &apos;V p*LDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 11730th July, 1965COPY NO.    5 UCABINETCOMPUTERSMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance in his memorandum (C.(65) 115) the Minister of Technology refers to a problem about requirements for the computer network for my Ministry.I am in fact very much concerned at the prolonged delay in placing an order for the first of a series of computers to be installed (at Reading) for thepayment of national insurance short-term benefits, and was about tobring to my colleagues&apos; attention the risk of serious criticism to which weshall be exposed if a decision is not taken promptly.2.      When the question of the purchase of computers was before theCabinet earlier this year (C. C. (65) 28th Conclusions, Minute 6 and 32ndConclusions, Minute 4), I had not yet reached conclusions on the tendersbut I warned my colleagues (C.(65) 67) that this is a field in which wecannot take risks that the equipment offered will not come up to itspromised performance.    Indeed in the field of social benefits the possi-bility cf a deterioration in the service to beneficiaries which could result from the use of less than fully reliable equipment is something which couldnot be contemplated.    I also pointed out that delay in installing computersfor the payment of national insurance short-term benefits would be expensive in terms of eventual savings forgone.3.       The tenders have now been evaluated and I am satisfied that theRemington Rand UNIVAC 494 computer system not only has the advantage over competing systems by reason of the greater savings in administrative costs which it offers but is the only tendered system which is acceptablefrom the standpoint of reliability.    The extent of these advantages is shownin the attached Note by Officials.    My propose,! that authority should nowbe given to purchase the UNIVAC 494 is supported by the Treasury and byH. M. Stationery Office.4.      It will be seen from, paragraph 4 of the attached note and the annexes that the officials considered the possibility of using the english electric LEO-Marconi (E.E.I..M.) installation with the substitution ofreliable disc files for magnetic card files (which are unreliable), but thatthis possibility has not been discussed with E.E. L, M. and that the officialsestimated that it would be very much more costly than either the E. E. L. M.system v/ith magnetic card files or than the UNIVAC 494.    It would also involve the expenditure of a greater amount of foreign currency than theUNIVAC 494.    I am informed that since the Note by Officials was drawn upthe possibility has been raised of using a new and improved form of discfiles with the LEO 326 which it is roughly estimated would bring the costof this installation with discs to a figure not very far above the cost of the-1-

27ft&apos;  isame installation with magnetic card files.    Delay would, however, be involved while the new disc file3, which are not yet in production, weretested and their development and use discussed with the manufacturers.If any of these alternatives was found to be acceptable the equipment would need to be obtained from the U. 3, A. as British manufacturers havenot yet developed equivalent devices.5.      Although I recognise that in time the magnetic card files offered by E.E.1j, M. may prove to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes or that in due course acceptable alternative equipment may become availableto British manufacturers, I am conscious that while we were waiting forthese developments we should be delaying the saving of substantialadministrative costs and man-power.    Further, delay at this stage withthe Reading installation would involve a consequential delay in completingnational coverage with postponement in achieving savings in money andman-power.    The staff saving expected v/hen the system is extended tothe whole of the country is of the order of about 5, 000.6.      I do not think this delay and the very substantial loss in administra-tive savings ought to be accepted.    The application of modern technologicadevelopments to the administration of social insurance has already aattracted attention in Parliament and is given a good deal of prominencein the Report of the Estimates Committee published a few days ago.Recently in my Annual Report and in answer to a Parliamentary QuestionI have held out the prospect that the first of the computers in the Regionswill be working before the end of 1966.    This prospect is now in jeopardyand certainly will not be fulfilled unless an order is placed very quickly.To wait for the results of further development of the magnetic card filesor for testing the new discs and discussing the possibility of their use withthe manufacturers would mean tha.t the date when the installation would be working could not be forecast, because there is no certainty of a favourabioutcome in either case, but that it certainly would not be earlier than the spring of 1967.7.       To sum up -(l) Ihe UNIVAG 494- is the only acceptable system tendered.(2)  The LEO 326 with magnetic card files is currently unreliableand as, I assume, no one would suggest that it could be acceptedbefore reliability was proved, a provisional decision in favour ofthis tender would mean an unpredictable delay which could hardly be less than six months and might be a great deal more.(3) A British system using discs of proved reliability could, itis thought, be installed, but this would involve, compared with theUNIVAC 494,(a) an increase of 55 per cent in the capital cost;(b) the expenditure of an additional  400, 000 of foreigncurrencyj  and(c) the loss of more than half the savings (estimated on thebasis of total discounted expenditure over 10 years) tobe secured by substituting a computer for the existingmanual system.-2-

hi3.       After carefully considering the general criteria which theMinister of Technology asks should be applied to proposals for thepurchase of computers for Government Departments, I am satisfied thatthe case of ordering the UNIVAC 494 for the Reading Centre remainsabsolutely sound.    I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree to theacceptance of Remington Rand&apos;s tender forthwith.M.H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C.2;,30th July, 1965.3-

COMPUTER FOR THE MINISTRY OF PENSIONSAND NATIONAL INSURANCE, READINGNote by officials the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance have proposed the purchase of a Remington Rand computer for their prototype short-term benefits payment centre at Reading which it is estimated will save 200, 000 per annum in administrative costs.    It is intended thatfollowing successful operation of the prototype, the centre at Readingwill be expanded to cover 30 per cent of the national lead of short-termbenefit work and that other centres will be established to cover theremainder cf the country producing an eventual saving of  1,400,000per annum.    At the request of the Ministry of Technology officials fromMinistry of Technology, Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,H. M. Stationery Office and Treasury met on 21ct June to discuss theproposed purchase.    Following this meeting, revised costings were produced for the Remington Rand system and two alternative english electric-L,KOrMarconi (E.E.1..M. ) systems each of which would havethe capacity to handle 30 per cent of the national load of short-term benefits.    These costings are given in Annex 1;  and Anntz 2 shows the approximate foreign currency content of each tender.2.       The UNI VAC 494 offered by Remington Rand is a recentlydeveloped system of advanced design and the Technical Support Unit(T. S. U.) expect its performance and reliability to be satisfactory.    Jitheir tender is accepted the installation could start to take on work towardsthe end of 1966 with completion of 30 per cent of national coverage by march, 1968.3.       The LEO 326 proposed by E.E.L.. M. makes use of a magneticcard file (rn. cf.) unit.    This is a new device developed and manufacturedby the Radio Company of America. (R. C. A. ) in the United States ofAmerica and so far three of these have been sent to this country.    Theirperformance has been shown tc be unsatisfactory and further development work is required.    It is known that R, C. A. have orders for some 40 ofthese machines for the United States Government and are continuingdevelopment but neither M.P.N. I. nor Treasury could support the placing of a contract for an installation which relied on ra. cf. s  before a demonstration satisfactory to the T. S. U. had been performed.    english electric have offered a demonstration in September, 1965, but T. S. U.are not hopeful of its outcome.4.      The English Electric installation could, avoid the use cf the m. cf.by substituting disc files which are also of American manufacture and whose reliability is not in question but which would cost considerably more than the m. c.f.    It has been assumed in the costings that these would be available without delay, but the manufacturers have not been consulted.5.      Although the M. P.N. I. are not committed by reason of legislativerequirements to bring the scheme into operation by any particular date,the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance has stated recently in herAnnual Report and in answer tc a Question in Parliament that it isproposed to instal a computer and associated equipment at Reading nextyear.    Installation of the E.E.L. M. equipment could not be achieved by-4-

1966 if the order for the equipment was held up pending satisfactorydemonstration of the m.c.f.    Moreover the cost, due to loss in savings,of waiting for the reliability of the m. cf. to be established v/ould amountto about  ICG, 000 a month in relation to the Reading installation,6.       The Reading installation is planned to be the first of four centreswhich will give national coverage.    There will be considerable advantage to the M. F.N. I. if the equipment and programmes used at Reading iscompatible with those to be used in the subsequent centres;  the winner ofthe contract for Reading is therefore in a very strong position to win thethree remaining contracts.7.       M. P. N. I. , H. M. 3. O. and the Treasury therefore recommendthat approval be given to the acceptance of the Remington Rand tender.July, 1965
