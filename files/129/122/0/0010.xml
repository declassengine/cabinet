COAL, prices memorandum by the Minister of power the Chairman of the National Coal B^oard has notified me that,subject to our views, the Board propose tc increase coal prices fromthe 1st September so as to cover the deficit on revenue account in1965-66 which&apos; will remain despite the capital reconstruction on whichwe decided at Cabinet on 1st July, 1965, (C.C.(65) 35th Conclusions,Minute 5).   I am aware that my colleagues wished consideration of increases to be deferred till later in the year, but I must bring thematter up urgently in view of developments in the Board&apos;s financialposition and their price proposals.2.      In February this year we authorised the Board to introduceprice increases, originally from 1st April, 1965, but these were, withour agreement, deferred.    Lord Rcbens hoped that the results of thefirst quarter of 1965-66 v/would  show some improvement on the original estimate and that this (combined with capital reconstruction) wouldenable the &quot;Board to break even.    This hope has not been fulfilled.3.       In February of this year the Board estimated their 1965-66deficit at about  40 million of which it was then intended  25 million should be met by price increases from 1st April, leaving  15 million to be covered in ether ways, including capital reconstruction.    Theincrease in the rate of productivity is proving less than was assumed in the Board1 s original estimates:   wage increases will add  6 million more than expected to the Board&apos;s costs:  their revenue from sales islikely to be below the original estimates, despite short-term measures ofassistance we have given to them.    The Board/s results for the first threemonths of 1965-66 are already  4 million worse than originallyestimated.    The Board now estimate that their deficit for 1965-66 willbe in the region of  55 million.    Some  30 million of this will, in theBoard&apos;s reckoning, be covered through capital reconstruction,leaving an additional  25 million to be recovered in the financial year1965-66, and this is the amount the Board propose to raise in the seven months from 1st September by price increases.4.      In the full year 1966-67 the price increases proposed would bring in  40 million and there is a reasonable prospect that price increasesnext year could be avoided, if the Board now make the increases proposed.5,       Because of the,need to consult the two Coal Consumers&apos; councils and to give notice to the public, the proposed increases can be effectiveon 1st September only if we take a decision before the end of this month to allow the Board to go forward with their proposals.-1-document IS THE PROPERTY OF PIER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)C.(65) IIP COPY NO.      5923rd July, 1965CABINET

6.       The Board&apos;s proposals are sumraarised in the Annex.    The main features are:-House coals, anthracite and dry steam coalsIncreases would vary between nothing for the lowest qualities of house coal to 20s. a ton for the highest qualities of house coal and foranthracite and dry steam coals, which are in short supply.    (Inaddition there v/iil be the tv/o normal seasonal increases of 10s. and20s. a ton for all these coals, and the Board propose that this yearthey should take effect on 1st September and 1st November respectively. )The total additional revenue from these arrangements is estimated at 9. 7 million in 1965-66, and  14. 8 million in a full year.Industrial coalsThe increases would vary according to the coalfield.    coal from the Yorkshire and East Midlands fields and from Scotland wouldnot be increased in price, but coals from other fields would beincreased by amounts varying from 5s. 3d. a ton in Lancashire to20s. a ton in South Wales and 21 s. 3d. a ton in Somerset.    Any additionin respect cf coal supplies for coke ovens would be limited to 7s. 6d,a ton.    The total additional revenue from these arrangements is estimatedat  15. 3 million in 1965-66 and  25 million in a full year.Phurnacite, coke and ether M. C.B. manufactured fuel3No increase is proposed.7.       In making the proposals, Lord Robens has said that the price changes should be such as to assist the objective of concentratingproduction in the really economic fields and of,eliminating uneconomicworking.    The East Midlands and Yorkshire coalfields, for which noincreases are proposed, ha.ve been consistently profitable;  and theScottish Division has shown substantial financial improvement sincethe selective price increases of 1962.    The ether fields, particularlySouth Wales, Durham and Northumberland, contain a ia.rge number ofgrossly uneconomic pits, and are a heavy financial burden on the Board.Lord llobens&apos; proposal to limit the increase for coke oven suppliesmay prevent renewed pressure for relaxation of the restrictions on imports.8.       The impact on consumers of these increases is complicated bytheir selective nature, and by the multiplicity of uses to which the many varieties and qualities of coal are put.    However, I can give mycolleagues a general indication of what is entailed.    The changes affectannually only about 47 million tons of industrial and public utilitybusiness and 22 million tons of domestic business, a total of 69 million tons, or less than half of the commercially disposable output.    the increases in pithead prices of domestic coals would, on average, addabout 0.1 per cent to the present cost of living index figure.    Goals forgeneral industry would rise in price by 11.5 per cent on average in the localities affected, but the total additional burden on industry from theelectricity and industrial coal price increases would represent on average betv/een 0.1 per cent and 0, 2 per cent of total industrial costs.The increases in electricity coal prices would be automatically passed on to industry through coal price clauses in electricity tariffs, and-2-

prices per unit would rise by an average of about 2 per cent, localvariation being from nil to perhaps 8 per cent.9.       There are three aspects of these price proposals which we need to consider - scale, timing, and distribution:   and we should do so inthe knowledge that we would have to shoulder responsibility for theconsequences of stopping or delaying the Board&apos;s proposals.The results of the first quarter of 1965-66 are disappointing andI have no reason to take a different view from the Board of the amountof money they need to raise in 1965-66.    Officials are working on proposals to assist the industry with the social and human costs ofaccelerated closures:  but any such assistance to the Board would onlyhelp to offset additional expenditure and would net improve the Board?isfinances significantly.    We v/culd be in some difficulty, if at the sametime as we were proposing to Parliament a write-off of  400 million of the Board&apos;s debt to the Exchequer, we were stopping the Board1 sproposals to put their finances thereafter on a sound footing.    As faras timing is concerned I wonder whether there would be any substantialadvantages to us in securing a deferment cf a price increase which seems inevitable and could be delayed at most for a month or two.    In themeantime the cost would have to be borne by the Exchequer and theincrease, when made, would have to be greater.    I think that theprinciples on which fee increases are distributed by the Coal Boardamong the various fields and coals are right.    They should help tobring a better correlation between prices and costs and assist the emergence of a more viable industry.10.       Subject to the viev/s of my colleagues I think we should not object to the Coal Board&apos;s proposals, and that we should allow them togo forward to the Consumers1 Councils.    The Board would doubtless be willing to consider minor modifications to meet particular points raised by the Councils and I shall consider any representations v/hichthe Councils may make, before the Board give effect to the proposals.F.
