IS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC L.AJESTY&apos;5 G cvSRNMEN1C. (65) 1432nd November, 1965CABINETimmigrationMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i seek my colleagues approval to the appointment, as a matterof urgency, cf a Committee to review the law on immigration.2.       The whole question of immigration into this country, and themeans by which it is regulated, is likely to be discussed in the debate on The queen&apos;a Speech - having regard to the omission of any referenceto a Bill taking further powers in relation to Commonwealth immigrantsand in the course of the subsequent debates on the Expiring Laws(Continuance) Bill (under which both the legislation regulating alienimmigration and that regulating Commonwealth immigration fall to be renewed).    We ought, therefore, to reach a conclusion at once on thequestion of an inquiry, so that if it is thought right to do so an announce-rnent can be made in the course of debate.3.       My colleagues in the Home Affairs Committee and I have considered whether to recommend a comprehensive review, possibly by a Royal Commission, covering broad issues of policy and the generalsystem of control, as v/ell as the legal powers on which control is basedWe have, however, come to the conclusion that such an inquiry wouldbe inopportune and that it would be preferable to appoint a committee with terms of reference limited to the questions of putting the existingtemporary legislation on to a permanent footing, for both aliens and commonwealth immigrants, and conferring rights of appeal onimmigrants refused entry or subsequently required to leave the country.We think that the general system of control should not be within its terms of reference and that the problem of the short-term visitor, as distinct from the immigrant who wishes to settle here, should also be excluded.    I therefore propose that the Committee should have thefollowing terms of reference:-&quot;To review the lav/ affecting aliens and Commonwealth citizens who wish to enter and settle in this country (including the remedies available to those refused admission to, orsubsequently required to leave, the country) and to make recommendations. &quot;4.       I propose that the inquiry should be undertaken by a departmental Committee of independent persons appointed by me.If the Cabinet approve my proposal, I shall have further discussions-1-
