^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)EARNINGS-RELATED SHORT-TERM BENEFITS:WIDOWS ALEQ77ANCEMote by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i was invited by the Cabinet to arrange for the Social services committee to consider the priority to be accorded to earnings-relatedwidow&apos;s allowance and the implications cf a decision to undertake such expenditure at the present time (C. C. (65) 54th Conclusions, Minute 3).The Committee based their consideration of the matter on a memorandumby the minster of Pensions which&quot; I append.2.       The general conciusiona of the Committee are that, whileadditional expenditure of  7 million on earnings-related widow&apos;allowance will limit to that extent freedom of decision on proposalsinvolving major expenditure in this field, e.g. the timing and amountof benefit increases, Income Guarantee and proposals which naay emerge from the Governments long-term review, nonetheless there are ctrongreasons of cocial policy for taking the opportunity of making this additional provision for widows comparable with, and at the same time as, the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefits.C.

(THIS DOCulTEHT IS THE PROPERTY^F HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S.S.(65) 32 COPY NO.   j f g26th October, 1965CABINETMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICESHaRNINGS -RELATED SHORT-TERM BENEFITS - MDOWS ALLOWANCEMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceMy memorandum C(65)137 sets out the main arguments in favour of including earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance in the scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits.   In considering that paper,the Committee may like to have the following further information.Public expenditure limits2o     The basic programme for benefits and assistance was calculated on theassumption that the rates of benefit and of assistance would be increased on 1st April each year in line.with the assumed rise in average real earnings (3-6 per cont a year),   /in allowance was added for earnings-related unemployment benefit.    The additional programme included afurther allowance to enable earnings relation to be extended to sickness benefit also.3.     For reasons explained below it seems unrealistic to assumeincreases of benefit rates each April.   Therefore the question whethermy proposals for earnings-related short-term benefits can be containedwithin my public expenditure limits has boon considered on thefollowing assumptions?-(a) that an interim increase in national assistance will be needed in 19663(b) the next general uprating of benefits and assistance,sufficient to keep them in line with the movement of earnings since March 1965? will take place on1st June 19675 and(c) the next general uprating would be in April 1969-4.     My proposals for earnings-related short-term benefits, includingthe extension to widow&apos;s allowance? are estimated to cost  59 million in the first full year.   Allowing for this and for certain other minor items of expenditure which have been agreed, the estimated expenditure on benefits and assistance would fall below the annual amountsapproved foa? my basic and additional programmes by the followingamountss-1.,u. s V

 ^million1966/67 1967/68 1968/69 1969/7045 3 72 &quot;18As I mentioned in S.3.(65)31, I am discussing with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer the significance of the large surpluses in the yearswhen there is no general uprating.Effect of changes in the assumed dates for uprating5.     The 1st June 1967 was taken as the date for the next upratingbecause this seemed realistic.    I think that the summer of 1966 wouldbe too early (at any rate unless we were going in for annual upratings,on which I say something below).   But in the autumn of next year wehave to launch the scheme of earnings-related benefits.   This will fullytax my Ministry, and we shall have a hard task to get and train the staffin time and to be ready to take the first impact of the scheme.   even when the scheme is launched, there will be a further severe testing time during the epidemic season in the early months of 19&amp;7.   Eor thesepractical reasons we must leave the work of uprating pension booksuntil we are clear of the epidemic season and I think it would be imprudent to plan for an uprating much before 1st June 1967-   If,however, we were able to bring the uprating forward by as much as amonth (though the advantage of this would be only marginal) expenditurein 1967/68 might be increased by something like  10 million, depending on how precisely the rounded figures turned out.6.     On the other hand, I do not think that we can rely upon holdingoff the uprating beyond about June 1967, especially if prices and earnings continue to rise at their present rate.    If wo could do so,this would, of course, ease the financial problem in 1967/68 but, infact, expenditure for that year on the basis envisaged in paragraph above is already within the limits after allowing for earnings-relatedwidow&apos;s allowance.7. Another possibility which has been mentioned is that we should goin for general upratings each year instead of at longer intervals.In present circumstances I am opposed to this if only because I shouldbe reluctant to undertake the major upheaval of an uprating each rear,at any rate until we have computer systems installed which will ease the task. If we did start annual upratings in 1966 we should, broadly speaking, use up our margin over tho whole period as well as seriouslyaggravating the financial situation next year.2.t

Possible Alternative Benefit ImprovementsIncome Guarantee8.     Perhaps the most important of the possible improvements we might make in social security benefits would be the introduction ofan Income Guarantee, but on a very modest scale and even this would cost  80 million to  100 million a year.   I have, however, circulated a memorandum to my colleagues (S.So(65) 31) making alternative proposals designed to achieve to some extent the same objectives throughthe development of national assistance at a cost of about  40 million a year.        In so far as these proposals would take my expenditure over the agreed limits I am considering whether they can be financed bypositive savings elsewhere.   Meanwhile I do not think they should beallowed to stand in the way of earnings-related widows allowance.Better benefits for the chronic sick9.     As I said in my memorandum 0.(65) 137 the shape of improvedprovisions for the chronic sick must depend very much on theconclusions of our long-term review of pensions and I do not think we should attempt to anticipate the outcome of that review.   It isnot possible to put a oost on possible improvements without knowingwhat they would be, but I can say that any worthwhile addition to thebenefits of the chronic sick would cost substantially more than the  7 million a year needed for earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance.     Forexample a special allowance of  2 a week for those among the chronicand elderly sick, who need constant attendance might well cost as muchas  50 million a year and perhaps even more.Age rule for widows10.   Again, it is difficult to suggest a cost for any alternativeprovisions for widowhood making pensions available below the presentage of 50, without knowing the shape of those provisions.   To give some idea of the order of costs which might be involved I can say that toreduce the present age limit from 50 to 45 would cost about  1.3 million a year, on present rates of benefit5 and to abolish the age conditioncompletely would cost something approaching  20 million a year rising to about  25 million.    Costs would be less if lower rates of benefitwere paid at lower ages but we should be establishing minimum standards for the future in advance of working out our long-term proposals.   We should be prejudicing those proposals if we committedourselves now to any scheme of graduated benefits for widows related to age.3-

Conclusion11.   My view, in short, is that our proposals for earnings-related short-terra benefits will not be complete nor acceptable to the house and the country without inclusion of an earnings-related short-termbenefit for widows   to give better cover for the early months ofwidowhood.   I give priority therefore to an earnings-related widow&apos;allowance over possible alternative improvements we might make, all ofwhich would in any event cost substantially more and most of which wecould hardly embark upon in the early future without prejudicing theconclusions of our long-term review.M. H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C.2.26th October, 1965.
