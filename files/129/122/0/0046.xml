The Franks	Committee	recommend increased rates of pay from		1st September, 1965	, as follow	s:				Recom-			Present	mended		Annual	Salary	Salary	Crude	Percentage	(Inner	(Inner	Percentage	increase sinceRank	London)	London)	Increase	last adjustment	 	 	%	%Permanent Sec-				retaries to the				Treasury and				Cabinet Office	S8C5	9200		1.79Other Permanent				 ecretaries	0285	8600	3.80	1.92Deputy Secretaries	5885	6300	7. 05	3. 47Under Secretaries	4785	5335	11. 49	5.56Assistant Sec-	3385-	35 85-	5. 90-	3.51-retaries	4385	4585	4. 5 6	2. 693.       These recommendations affect about 8,000 civil servants in all,including those in the Professional, Scientific and other SpecialistClasses in the Higher Civil Service.    Their direct cost v/ould be about 1. 5 million in a full year.    There are also a number of other groupswho are likely to be affected indirectly to a greater or less degree,e. g. staff in the Atomic Energy Authority, senior officers in the armed forces and certain smaller groups; and there are also the effects overa wider field to be considered, for instance on the doctors.    The cabinet will be considering memoranda on the pay of the Armed Forces anddoctors,4.       The White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639)states that the norm is an average annual rate.    For the higher CivilService as a whole,, these increases average out at a.n annual rate of3^- per cent of the total salary bill, i. e, within the norm.    Taking the grades separately, the Under Secretary increase exceeds the norm,and paragraph 5 of the Franks R.reports indicates that there are special reasons for that.

K 11 Qt3 w o5.       The Committee also recommend that;(i) Higher Civil Service grades up to and including Under Secretarymay from 1967 receive, after reference to the Committee, the equivalent of any Central Pay increases which may be av/ardedto the rest of the Civil Service; and(ii)  London weighting should no longer be paid at Deputy Secretarylevel and above.The first of these two recommendations presents no difficulty; nor does the second, provided that increases at these levels are at least as muchas the present London addition of  85.    But the main recommendations on pay (as summarised in paragraph 2) are another matter.6.      Acceptance of the Standing Advisory Committee^ recommenda-tions is not obligatory.    The Royal Commission on the Civil Serviceof 195 3-55 (the Priestley Commission), which recommended the settingup of this Committee, said that the findings of the Committee should beadvisory and not binding on the Government.    However the PriestleyCommission also said that they thought it would be most unlikely thatthe Government would fail to take action when the Committee tenderedadvice;  and on the four previous occasions on which the Committeehave recommended higher rates of pay, their recommendations havebeen accepted in full by the Government of the day and implementedforthwith,7.       In normal circumstances, I should have no hesitation in recommending to my colleagues that the Committee&apos;s advice on thenew rates of pay for the higher Civil Service should be accepted.    Thereis no doubt that the increases proposed are justified on fair outsidecomparisons.    But present circumstances are not normal.    Garincomes policy is at a crucial point.    We have been accused of failing to carry out this policy even in those fields which are under our direct control.    If some senior civil servants are now given increases of asmuch as llj per cent in crude terms some people may say that we donot mean business.    It is true that on an annual basis the increases are much smaller and taken as a whole fall within the norm.    But it is very doubtful whether arguments based on annual percentages carry muchconviction when one is dealing with highly paid people.    We had, forexample, to face vociferous criticism about the increases for theHigher Judiciary, which were within the norm but in crude percentage terms, at 25 per cent^v/ere  very largo.    What critics tend to seizeon in cases of this sort is the crude size of the increase.   In any case,the concept of a norm means that some people must get less if others are to be given more.    It may well be that the more highly paid public servants ought to be among those who, at this stage at any rate, shouldbe given increases of less than the norm.8.       These considerations point to the desirability of our refusing to implement the Standing Advisory Committee&apos;s recommendations as they now stand.     There are also, however, some important factors whichpoint the other way.    In the first place, there are the comments of thePriestley Commission and the precedents to which I have referred inparagraph 6.    In addition;

(i)  If we do not accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations, which theyput forward as persons of judgment who have been expressly chargedwith advising the Government, their resignation may follow.    Perhapsthis would not be a disaster; but it might have wider effects in the field of independent advice.    We might also be told that we were singling outthe higher ranks of the public service for specially rigorous treatment,a course followed for all ranks by previous administration during the&quot;pay pause&quot; of 1961-62.(ii)  The recommendations were formulated by the Franks Committeespecifically with the general economic situation in mind.(iii) A suspicion that we are treating civil servants less than fairlycould affect recruitment, particularly in the fields in which there isalready such grave difficulty in meeting the competition of the expandinguniversities.(iv) A decision not to implement the recommendations may give riseto difficulties in relation to the medical profession, whose own indepen-dent review body will shortly be asked to recommend what increases intheir remuneration should be given.    The Minister of Health is circula-ting a memorandum dealing with this related issue.(v)  Good management is seriously impeded by the cramped paydifferentials between the grades of the higher Civil Service, particularlybetween the Under Secretary and the Assistant Secretary on his maximum.This is not simply a question of the salary gap between these two gradesthemselves.    There are about 350 posts, mainly in the scientific and professional fields, on salaries which have to be fitted within this gap.Since 1st January, 1964, this differential (expressed as a percentage ofthe Assistant Secretary maximum) has been cut to little more than one-third of the differential following Priestley.    This led the standing advisory Committee (see paragraph 5 of Lord Franks1 letter) to conductits present review, and to recommend in effect that, whilst the post-Priestley position should not now be fully restored, the differential shouldbe increased to two-thirds of v/hat it was in 1956.    These differentialsare too small to allow a proper grading structure or to give adequaterewards for promotion.(vi)  &quot;We have to bear in mind that unless special action is taken (a3 itwas when implementation of the full Chorley recommendations was poct-poned in 1949), the pensions of those retiring in the near future would be permanently affected by a decision to reduce or defer the pay increases recommended,9. This, then, is the background against which my colleagues will wish to consider the problem. Several courses are open to us and themain possibilities are as follows:(a)    Acceptance.     One might justify this by reference to the precedents for accepting the Standing Advisory Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions, to the fact that taking the higher Civil Service as a whole the increases are within the norm, and to the fact that theCommittee1 s recommendations expressly took the economicsituation into account.    One might draw special attention tothe relatively small increases at the highest levels -  315 fora Permanent Secretary.

Li, J. C.Treasury Chambers, S, W,l.Cth November, 1965(b) Rejection.    A straight rejection would be unwise particularly-having regard to its effect on the negotiations on doctors&apos; pay.Between these two extremes there are at least three other possibilities.(c) For the present allow no increases at all at the highest levels(above Under Secretary) and confine immediate increases toa straight 3-^-per cent at Assistant Secretary and Under Secretarylevels.    At the same time v/e would undertake to implement the balance of the Franks recommendations from 1st September,1966.     This v/ould mean that the bunching of rates of pay atthe Assistant Secretary/Under Secretary level (paragraph(v) above) would remain almost unchanged, for the next 12months, when the situation would be corrected.(d) Accept the recommendations to the extent that they do notexceed an annual rate of increase of 3-jr per cent.    The onlygrade which on this basis would receive less than the increases recommended by the Franks Committee would be the UnderSecretary,    Re would receive something over half of the recommended increases and would get the rest next year.This would dhninish, but would not remove until next year,the cramping effect of the compression of the assistant secretary/Under Secretary differential since 1st January,1964.(e) Accept the jJ&quot;ranks recommendations as to their amount, butdefer their operative date from 1st September, 1965, to 1stJanuary, 1966, the date from which increases in the pay of thelower and middle grades operate under an agreement which runs to the end of 1966.    This course of action v/ould almost certainly be less unpalatable to the Civil Service unions than(b) to (d) above.    They might possibly be persuaded to acquiesce in it.    For the higher Civil Service as a whole the increases would average out at an annual rate of 2.72 per cent,well under the norm; but this v/ould not meet the objectionabout the size of the crude increase indicated in paragraph above.If it is decided to proceed either on the lines of (c) or (d) above it wouldseem right to protect the pension position of those retiring in the nearfuture from the permanent effect of deferred pay increases.    I am advised that this can be done simply and without legislation.10.       The choice betv/een these courses of action is difficult.    Ipropose to let my colleagues know orally what my conclusions are.

Seventh report  am writing to report to you the conclusions and recommenda-tions reached by the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of theHigher Civil Service as a result of the further general review, thedecision to embark upon which I reported when I wrote to you on 19thJanuary last.2.       We conducted our last general review of the pay of the higher civil Service in 1963.    As a result of our recommendations the salaries of the Administrative grades in the Higher Civil Service were increasedwith effect from 1st August, 1963, to the rates shown below, and the salaries of other classes and grades in the Higher Civil Service werecorrespondingly increased.National rates Joint Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury and secretary of the Cabinet 8, 800Other Permanent Secretaries 8, 200Deputy Secretaries 5,800Undersecretaries 4,700Assistant Secretaries 3,05 0-3,900At that time the London weighting payable over and above those nationalrates of pay for staff working in London was  65 for staff employed inInner London (up to three miles from Charing Cross) and  60 for staff employed in Outer London (up to sixteen miles from Charing Cross).From 1st january.ry, 1964, these amounts were raised to  85 for staff employed in Inner London (up to four miles from Charing Cross) and  65 for staff employed in Outer London.3.       In June, 1964, the National Vhitley Council reported to us a pay agreement of 6th February, 1964, providing for the pay of moot grades in the non-industrial Civil Service with salary scales whose maxima didnot exceed that of the Principals&apos; scale to be increased by 3 per cent from 1st January, 1964, jr. per cent from 1st January, 1965, and 34 percent from 1st January, 1966.     The agreement provided that for any gradewhich was on any of these dates the subject of a pay research survey(or was linked for pay purposes to such a grade) the payment of the cen-tral pay increase due on that date should be deferred, and only made if by the following 30th June negotiations on the survey had not producedThe Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, O.B. E., M. P. ,10, Downing Street, S. W. 1.Cabinet Office,London, S, W. 1.5th August, 1965STANDING ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE PAY OF THEHIGHER CIVIL SERVICE

either a settlement or a decision to go to arbitration.    TheAdministrative and Executive Classes were being surveyed on 1stJanuary, 1964, so that the Principals and a number cf other grades didnot immediately become entitled to the first of the three increases.The agreement was not in fact reported to us until it had become clearthat negotiations on the Administrative and Executive Class pay researcsurveys could not be completed by 30th Jvme, 1964, and that the centralpay increase would therefore become payable to the Principals and theother grades concerned with effect from 1st January, 1964.4.       In December, 1964, the Treasury, the Association of FirstDivision Civil Servants and the Society of Civil Servants informed us that, following pay research surveys for the Administrative and executive Classes, agreements had been reached to increase thePrincipals&apos; salary scale to   2,100-  2, 900 (national rates) and theChief Executive Officers&apos; salary scale to   2,4Q0- 2,800 (nationalrates) with effect from 1st January, 1964, and invited us to recommendnew salary scales with effect from 1st January, 1964, for the higher civil Service grades covered by these surveys, as follows -National ratesAtAssistant Secretaries 3, 300-4, 300Principal Executive Officers 3,800Senior Chief Executive Officers 2,950-3,300At the same time we were invited to recommend corresponding inc-reases for other Higher Civil Service grades at comparable levels.5.       Vfe accepted these proposals, and recommended accordinglyon 19th January, 1965;  our recommendations were in due courseaccepted and put into effect.    In reporting them we stated that we thought that the new differential thus created between the AssistantSecretaries1 maximum and the Under Secretaries1 rate was too smallto be allowed to persist.    We also took into account the steadynarrowing of the differential between the Principals1 maximum and the assistant Secretaries&apos; minimum as a result of the 1965 and 1966central pay increases under the agreement referred to in paragraph above: the Principals&apos; maximum rose from  2,900 to  3,002 from 1stJanuary, 1965, and will rise again to  3,107 from 1st January, 1966.It was in these circumstances that we decided that the time had cometo embark on a further general review of the pay of the Higher CivilService.6.       The Staff Side of the National Whitley Council have suggested to us that the problems created by the narrowing of differentials as aresult of applying central pay increases up to the Principals1 maximumbut not to the Higher Civil Service could be avoided by applying centralpay increases right to the top of the Civil Service.    They point out that,at a time of relatively frequent movements of pay in the rest of theCivil Service, to adjust Higher Civil Service salaries only once everyfour or five years not only gives rice to constant difficulties withdifferentials between the Higher Civil Service and the rest of the CivilService, but also means that members of the Higher Civil Servicereceive less total pay than they otherwise v/ould and tends to have an adverse effect upon retirement benefits, which are calculated ont3 JL tJ

average salary over the last three years of service.     The national staff Side suggest that, if it is felt undesirable to extend central pay settlements to the very highest ranks of the Higher Civil Service,they should at least be extended to grades and posts up to and including the Under Secretary and there should be biennial reviews of salaries above that level.7.       The Treasury agree that, since central pay settlements arenow given more frequently than was envisaged by the RoyalCommission on the Civil Service 1953-55 (from whose recommenda-tions the existing arrangements stem), there would be advantage ifHigher Civil Service grades up to and including the Under Secretaryreceived the equivalent of central pay increases.    They consider,however, that above that level there should be no commitment to annual or biennial reviews, since they believe as a matter ofprinciple that the higher the grade in the public service the greater the desirability that its pay should move relatively infrequently, andthen only as a result of weighty and specific investigation.8.       We accept that Higher Civil Service grades up to an includingthe Under Secretary should in future receive the equivalent of centralpay increases.    The evidence which we have collected suggests that both in other public services and in employment outside the publicservice the salaries of senior staff now tend to move more or less in parallel with those of subordinate salaried staff, save at the highestlevels in industry.    On the other hand it seems to us that the specialconsiderations which the Royal Commission identified as entering into assessments of the pay of the Higher Civil Service are particularly important in relation to the highest ranks (those whose rate exceedsthat of the Under Secretary), and that at those levels salaries shouldnot as a matter of course follow salary movements lower down.    Weconsider therefore that central pay increases should not apply togrades above the level of Under Secretary.9.       If the limit for central pay increases is raised as we propose,the technical problems created by narrowing of differentials as aresult of central pay increases will no longer arise in the areadirectly above the Principals&apos; maximum.    They will to some extent be recreated in the area directly above the Under Secretaries&apos; rate.At that level, however, the number of grades and posts affected in which smaller and the gaps between rates are wider.   Some temporarynarrowing of differentials is therefore easier to accommodate at that level.10.       Since the pay of the Higher Civil Service is determined underdifferent arrangements from the pay of the rest of the non-industrial civil Service, it would not be appropriate to include Higher CivilService grades up to and including the Under Secretary in national whitley Council central pay agreements.    We therefore recommendthat in future central pay increases for grades up to and includingthe Principal should be reported to us, on the understanding that whencentral pay increases are received by Principals we shall normallyrecommend similar increases for grades and posts in the higher civil Service whose fixed rates or scale maxima do not exceed the under Secretary rate, which will involve appropriate adjustments forgrades and posts between Under Secretary and Deputy Secretarylevel.    In considering our recommendations on new rates of pay wehave assumed that this recommendation will be accepted.

11.       It does not seem to us to be necessary or desirable to fix the frequency of reviews of other Higher Civil Service salaries.    Under thepresent arrangements reviews of the pay of the Higher Civil service can be undertaken either at the Governments request or on our own initiative;  the Government are free to request, and we are free to initiate, reviews at any time they, or we, think right.    We therefore recommend no other changes in these arrangements.    It is clear,however, that the pay of Assistant Secretaries, Principal executive officers and Senior Chief Executive Officers will have to be reviewedwhen the results of pay research surveys for the Administrative and executive Classes are known, and we expect (without seeking to bindthe Government or ourselves in any way) that those reviews may wellprovide suitable occasions for reviewing the pay of the Higher CivilService as a whole.12.       The Treasury and the National Staff Side have invited us to frameour recommendations on this occasion and in future for salaries at and above the level of the Deputy Secretary on the basis that London weightingwill not be payable at these levels and that salaries should take accountof this fact.    They point out that only a very few posts at these levelsare outside London; to all intents and purposes the effective rate of pay for almost all of those concerned is the amount payable to those employedin Inner London.    We agree that the arguments for a system of Londonweighting on national rates hardly apply to staff at these salary levelsvirtually all of whom work in London.    Accordingly we recommend thatLondon weighting should from 1st September, 1965, cease to be payable to Deputy Secretaries or to staff in any other grade or post on a flat rate or with a scale maximum which is the same as or more than the deputy Secretary&apos;s rate.    In considering our recommendations on new rates of pay we have assumed that this recommendation will be accepted.13.       We decided to embark upon this review mainly on account of thecompression of differentials between Principals, Assistant Secretariesand Under Secretaries and between grades at corresponding levels inother classes, and our main concern in this review has been to restorea workable pattern of salary relationships in the Higher Civil Service.&quot;We have also taken the opportunity of collecting information about howsalaries in other public services and in broadly comparable employmentoutside the public service have moved since our last general review.V/e acknowledge gratefully the help we have received from those of whom,we have made inquiries for this purpose.14.       We have also had regard to the general economic situation in which our recommendations are made.    We are not specifically required to doso by our terms of reference, indeed we recognise that one of thepurposes of establishing the Committee was to provide a source of independent advice to Governments who might on occasion find itdifficult to balance their obligations as employers of senior civilservants against their wider responsibilities for management of the economy.    On this occasion, however, we have felt that our view of theeconomic problems confronting the country must lead us to modify viewsbased on other considerations about the pay of the highest grades ofcivil servants.    &apos;v7&quot;e believe that our recommendations will establish a pattern of salary &quot;relationships which can be regarded as workableand tolerable for the time being; but the new rates, particularly at thehighest levels, do not fully reflect our assessment of what v/ould con-stitute fair and reasonable remuneration for the grades in question,because in our judgment at those levels in the Civil Service what is

appropriate to the general state of the economy must for the timebeing over-ride other considerations.    We should not, however, thinkit right for those concerned to be indefinitely penalised by a decision taken in the light of a particular economic situation, and we thereforeintend to review the salaries of these grades earlier than would other-wise be the case.15.       Taking all these considerations into account we recommend thefollowing new rates for the administrative grades in the Higher CivilService, to take effect from 1st September, 1965 -Joint Permanent Secretaries to theTreasury and Secretary of the CabinetOther Permanent SecretariesDeputy SecretariesUnder SecretariesAssistant Secretaries9,200 (*)3,600 (*)6, 300 (*)5, 25 0 (National)3,500-4,500 (National)*  In accordance with our recommendation in paragraph 12 the ratesmarked with an asterisk will not attract London weighting: these will be the rates payable to the staff concerned whether they areemployed in London or elsewhere.We recommend that rates of pay for other classes and grades in theHigher Civil Service should be revised from the same date to givecorresponding increases at comparable salary levels.    these recommendations take account of the central pay increases that are due under the agreement of 16th February, 1964; to come into effecton 1st January, 1966, for grades up to and including the Principal, andwe do not intend to recommend any further adjustment of pay in theHigher Civil Service on that account.16.       We have received a submission from the Society of Civil Servantinviting us to recommend that Principal Executive Officers should bepaid on a scale rather than on a flat rate and that the level of their pay should be raised in relation to that of Assistant Secretaries.    We have carefully considered both this submission and a counter-submission bythe Treasury, but v/e ha.ve come to the conclusion, having regard to the definition of our scope and funtions laid down by the Royal Commissionon the Civil Service (Cmnd. 9613, paragraphs 386 to 389), that theseare not sufficiently major matters to warrant our intervention, and wetherefore make no recommendations on them.(Signed)   FRANKS
