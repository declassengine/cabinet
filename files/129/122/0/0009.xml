C. (65)  109 COPY NO.        5923rd July, 1965CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on 8th July(C. C. (65) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Commonwealth ImmigrationCommittee have prepared drafts of a White Paper (Annex A) and of astatement of Government policy (Annex B) on commonwealth immigration.2*     Timetable.    If the draft can be sent to the printers on the evening of 27th July it should be possible for the White Paper to bepublished on 2nd August.    It had previously been envisaged that thestatement of Government policy would be made in advance of thepublication of the White Paper.    &apos;We have however undertaken todiscuss the Governments decisions with Commonwealth and colonial governments in advance of any public statement.    This implies thatthey should not only be informed but also be given time to express their views before the Governments decisions are announced.    Itwould therefore be convenient if the statement of Government policy were made on the same day as the publication of the White Paper.This has the additional advantage that the statement of policy can be relatively short and can refer for a more detailed explanation of theGovernments decisions to the White Paper.3.     The Cabinet1 s attention is particularly invited to the followingpoints in the White Paper.(i)      VouchersIn summing up the discussion on the 8th July the PrimeMinister suggested that the total number of vouchers should be 8,500a year; that this would allow for 1, 000 immigrants a year from Maltafor the next two or three years, but that there should be no public statement to that effect nor should the total figure otherwise be dividedinto quotas for separate countries.    It has been pointed out to theCommonwealth Immigration Committee that the arrangements to bemade for Malta cannot be kept secret - the figure of 1,000 vouchersa year has already appeared in the press - and the Committee therefore recommend that the position be clearly sta.ted in the terms proposed inparagraph 16 of the White Paper.The Committee also recommend that it should be stated in theWhite Paper that not more than 15 per cent of Category A vouchers willbe allotted to any one Commonwealth country.    This modifies theCabinet&apos;s view that the admission of unskilled workers should be governed by the date of their applications.    It is however essential if a fair balance is to be maintained and if the interests of some of-1-j .    126HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

the smaller Commonwealth countries and dependent territories are tobe safeguarded.    The distribution of vouchers cannot in any case beconcealed since it is the practice to publish the figures of vouchersissued, showing the countries of origin.The Committee further recommend that the Minister of labour should have discretion, in granting Category A vouchers, to give ameasure of priority to the more essential types of employment,e. g. the hospital and transport services.    This is the more importantif the needs of these services are to be met within the reduced numberof Category A vouchers which will in future be issued.    This systemof priorities would be subject to review from time to time and no publicity would be given to it.    The Cabinet may wish to considerwhether this would require any amendment of paragraph 17 (ii) of theWhite Paper which states that applications for Category A vouchers willbe dealt with in the order of the date of their receipt, subject only tothe provision that not more than 15 per cent will go to any oneCommonwealth country.The White Paper states that the new arrangements for theissue of vouchers will come into effect from 2nd August, i. e. simul-taneously with the announcement of the Governments policy.    This isdesirable to prevent a flood of applications from commonwealth immigrants who would be entitled to Category B vouchers under theexisting scheme but who will no longer be so entitled under the new arrangements.    This need not, however, prevent the Minister ofLabour from dealing with applications ali*eady in the pipeline underthe existing scheme during a short transitional period.(ii)      AliensAt their meeting on 8th July the Cabinet invited the HomeSecretary to keep under review the number of aliens accepted for permanent settlement in the United Kingdom and to bring the matter before them if it appeared that the average was likely to rise above6, 000 a year.    I understand that the figures for the first six monthsof this year show a marked increase and that the Home Secretary issubmitting a paper to Cabinet,    Meanwhile, no reference to this pointhas been included in the White Paper or the statement of government policy.(iii)      DependantsThe Cabinet decided that dependants should be strictly limited towives and children under sixteen, but that there should be no change intheir statutory right to accompany or follow the immigrant workers tothis country.    In summing up the discussion, however, the PrimeMinister said that immigration officers should use their existing powers normally to refuse admission to persons of whose bona fidesthey were in doubt; and in exercising those powers they should take into consideration whether or not the individuals possessed acertificate of registration of their status as dependants.Paragraph 20 of the White Paper reflects these decisions.    It is hopedthat the scheme whereby immigrant workers would declare their dependants, so that the particulars could be checked in the country of origin and entry certificates issued, ca,n come into force on-2-

-3-1st September.    At present the White Paper only says that forms willbe available &quot;early in September&quot;.    The Cabinet may wish to considerwhether the necessary administrative arrangements can be completed in time so that a firm date of 1st September could be given in the white paper for the introduction of the scheme.    The commonwealth immigration Committee recognise that it will not be fully effective in preventing evasion.    The possession of an entry certificate cannotbe made a compulsory condition of entry and immigration officersmust retain discretion to admit dependants of whose bona fides theyare satisfied even in the absence of an entry certificate.    It is however hoped that the scheme will to some extent act as a deterrentand prevent the influx of dependants which might otherwise follow thepublication of the White Paper.    Since there must be some doubt aboutthe effectiveness of the scheme, the White Paper provides that theHome Secretary will keep under close review the administrative arrangements as to the evidence that dependants are required tofurnish on arrival, and the Government will seek any necessa.ry legal powers to make the control effective.(iv)      Conditions of EntryThe Cabinet agreed that power should be taken to requireCommonwealth students whose bona fides  were in doubt to registerwith the Police.    The Cabinet also agreed however with the recom-mendation of the Commonwealth Immigration Committee that, in the context of a general power to impose conditions of entry on all commonwealth citizens, the requirement to register with the police should not be imposed unless conferred by a statutory instrumentsubject to the Affirmative Resolution procedure.    The stage at whichthe requirement to register with the Police will be introduced inregard to students or other categories of Commonwealth citizensentering the United Kingdom will have to be resolved when new legislation is drafted.    For the time being the commonwealth immigration Committee recommend that it is unnecessary to be more specific than is suggested in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the White Paper.(v)      Financial Assistance for Local AuthoritiesIn view of the statement in the Manifesto that &quot;a labour government will give special help to local authorities in areas whereimmigrants have settled&quot;, the Commonwealth Immigration committee consider it essential that the White Paper should contain a pledgethat financial assistance will be available in certain circumstances.This pledge is contained in paragraph 62 of the draft.    The Treasuryreserved their position in the Committee.    They point out that although the total expenditure involved is unlikely to be large, thescope of this very special grant (which would need legislation), theway in which it would operate, ?*nd how overlapping with the existing arrangements for assisting local authorities   can be avoided, have yet to be worked out.     They also feel that the paragraph as draftedmight encourage local authorities to expect too much so that the credit for the Government^ proposals v/ould be lost.    If it is regardedas essential to enter into a commitment to financial assistance before

a detailed scheme could be worked out, they suggest that the paragraph should be amended to read-&quot;In some areas, the local authority may need to undertakeexceptional commitments for a limited period byengaging extra staff in order to ease those pressures onthe social services which arise from differences in language and cultural background and to deal with problemsof transition and adjustment.    The Government proposeto seek powers to give special financial help towardsapproved expenditure in such cases where need is shown. &quot;The Cabinet may wish to consider which of these texts shouldbe adopted.4.      Knowledge of English.    The Mountbatten Report recommendedthat immigrants who came to work should have to satisfy the british high Commission in the country of origin that they have sufficientEnglish to become assimilated to the British community.    The Reportdrew attention however (paragraph 69) to the difficulty of making sucha condition effective and also to the fact that in some commonwealth countries ^ above all Pakistan, it would virtually eliminate the grantof Category A vouchers.    The view of the Commonwealth ImmigrationCommittee is that this condition is desirable in principle but thatarrangements to give effect to it would take time to work out.Moreover, it would involve discrimination against commonwealth immigrants as compared with aliens, and under the new voucherarrangements the number of immigrant workers from the Common-wealth entering the United Kingdom who do not speak adequateEnglish should be much reduced (the condition could not, in any case,be applied to dependants).    The Commonwealth Immigration committee therefore recommend that this condition of entry should not be imposed, at least for the time being, and that no reference to thematter be made in the White Paper.5.     In the Cabinet discussion of the draft V/hite Paper on the aid programme on 20th July (C. C. (65) 39th Conclusions, Item 2) thepoint was made that the draft should be examined in parallel with thedraft of the proposed V/hite Paper on Lmrnigration in order toensure that there was no inconsistency between them as regards theirrespective treatment of such questions as oversea students.    The twodraft White Papers have been examined and certain amendments havebeen made to each in order to ensure that there is no inconsistency.H. B.Privy Council Office, S, W. 1.23rd July, 1965-4-

.ANREX ADRAFT WHITE PAPERIMMIGRATION FROM THE COMMONWEALTHA POLICY FOR THE FUTUREPART I INTRODUCTION-----This paper sets out the Governments future policy on immlgrattonto Britain from other parts of the Commonwealth and the problems to which it has given rise.   This policy has two aspects:    onerelating to control on the entry of immigrants so that it doesnot outrun Britain&apos;s capacity to absorb them;    the other relatingto positive measures designed to secure for the immigrants andtheir children their rightful place in our society, and to assistlocal authorities and other bodies in areas of high immigrationin dealing with certain problems which have arisen.Immigration up to 19622.     Until 1962 every Commonwealth citizen was entitled to enter the United Kingdom at will.   This right had been freely exercisedfor many years but it was only in the ten years from 1952 onwardsthat a substantial number of people from the Commonwealth began to think of settling in Britain.   From 1955 a rough count was kept cf the number of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean,Asia, East and West Africa and the Mediterranean entering and leaving the country.   During the period from 1st January 1955 to30th   June 1962 the net intake (that is, the total numberentering during the year less the total number leaving during thesame year) is estimated to have been as follows:1955 1+2,7001956 1+6,8501957 1+2,4001958 29,8501959 21,600-1-

*The statistics for the period since 1st July 1962, whenCommonwealth citizens became subject to immigration control,are collected on a different basis.   They are summarised inparagraph /9&quot;7 below.-2-i960 57,7001961 136,koo1962 94,900(to 30th June)*3.     Britain has always been reluctant to restrict the entry of people who hope to find greater opportunities within her shores- It isonly during the past 60 years that control has been continuouslyexercised over foreign immigration.    It was with even greaterreluctance that control over immigration from the Commonwealthwas introduced in 1962.     The operation of the commonwealth immigrants *.ot over the past three years is described in thefollowing paragraphs.The present controlh.     Section 2 of the Act gives an immigration officer power torefuse admission or to admit subject to a condition restricting the period of stay, with or without a condition restrictingfreedom to take employment.   People born in the United Kingdomand certain classes of people holding United Kingdom passportsare, however, completely exempt from control.   There is also no general power to refuse admission to people ordinarily residenthere, to holders of Ministry of Labour vouchers or to wives andchildren under 16 accompanying or joining their husbands orparents, nor is there any power to admit them subject to conditions.   Returning residents, wives and children under 16 maybe refused admission only if the subject of a deportation order;voucher holders, students and persons ef independent means(including visitors) may be refused admission on that ground,on medical or security grounds or en account of criminal record.

The immigration officers&apos; powers are exercised in accordance withpublished instructions (Cmnd, 1716) that were put before parliament in draft while the Bill was being debated.5.     A Commonwealth citizen who wants to work and settle in theUnited Kingdom must first obtain a Ministry of Labour voucher.Applications for vouchers are placed in three categories:    CategoryA is for applications by employers in this country who have a specific job to offer to a particular Commonwealth citizen,Category B is for applications by Commonwealth citizens withouta specific job to come to but with certain special qualifications(e.g. nurses, teachers, doctors) and Category C is far all others.Applications in Categories A and B are given priority.   The issueof vouchers in Category C has been subject to the condition thatno country shall receive more than a quarter of the vouchersavailable for issue, and within Category C preference is given to applicants who have served in our&quot; Armed Forces.   Vouchers have beenissued to other applicants in Category C in the order in which their applications are received in London.6.     The rate at which vouchers are issued is decided by theGovernment and has varied from time to time.    In 1962 and thefirst months of 1963 a high proportion of the vouchers issued werenot taken up and the rate of issue was therefore increased.   But as time went on a much higher- proportion of the vouchers came to beused.   The rate of issue was then reduced and for some time hasbeen at the rate of U00 a week;    *f these about three-quarters arebeing used.   When the scheme first started it was thought that most of the vouchers would be issued to applicants in Category C;but since September 19 6U. the two priority classes, Categories Aand B, have taken up the whole issue of hOO vouchers a week andhave left none over for applicants in Category C.   a waiting listof over 300*000 applicants has grown up in this category.7.     The Act gives an absolute right of entry to the wife and anychild under 16 of a Commonwealth citizen who accompanies them tothe United Kingdom or is already resident here.    Certain ather

-k-categories of dependants are in practice, but purely by wayof discretion, also admitted without vouchers, e.g.(a) a child under 16 coming to join a close relativeother than a parent;(b) a son or daughter aged 16 but under 18 coming with or to join a parent;(c) the fiancee or &quot;common law wife&quot; of a man settledhere;(d) the widowed mother or elderly parents of a personsettled here.8.     Bona fide students and visitors have been freely admitted.They have benefited by the arrangement under which anyCommonwealth citizen seeking admission without a voucher may apply for an &quot;entry certificate&quot; before leaving home to makereasonably sure of being admitted on arrival.Immigration since 19629.     Statistics of the movement to and from the United Kingdomof Commonwealth citizens subject to immigration control havebeen published:   detailed figures can be found in Cmnd. 2379and Cmnd. 2658.     The main figures are summarised below withfigures for the first six months of 1965:Citizens of Canada, Australia or New Zealand1963 196k 1965Numbers admitted, by categories Jan-Junea. visitors 130,625        151,737 76,680b. students 2,11k 2,073 696c. voucher-holders 1 ,kk7 817 321d. others admitted for settlement (mainlydependants) 2,288 2,2k3 1,011e. remainder (mainly&quot;returning residents&quot;) 51,093 55,369 25,753

The number of immigrants from the areas of the Commonwealthmentioned in paragraph 2 now settled in Britain, together withthe children born to them here, cannot be estimated with anyprecision but probably lies between 750,000 and one million.The number of people overseas who have a right of entry to-5-Jan-June10k,k6683,75215,71k

this country as a result of their husbands or parents having already emigrated here is considerable;    it is not possibleto make any accurate assessment of the figure.Recent developments11.    Part I of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, which providesfor control of immigration, requires annual renewal.      (Part II,which relates to deportation, is permanent legislation.)Shortly after taking office in October 19*54 the present government obtained from Parliament the renewal of Part I ofthe Act for a further year pending consultation with other commonwealth governments on the whole question of immigration.12.    On 4th February 1965 the Home Secretary informed theHouse of Commons (Official Report, cols. 1284-8) that he had found evidence that evasion of the existing control was beingpractised on a considerable scale-instructing immigration officers to scrutinise more carefully the intentions and bona fides of Commonwealth citizens whosought entry, and to make fuller use of their power to imposeconditions.     One effect of the latter instruction is thatstudents5 although admitted as freely as before, are nowadmitted only for a specified period, which is extended ifnecessary so long as they are genuinely pursuing their studies.The Home Secretary also announced his decision to reinforce the staffs in certain posts overseas dealing with applications for entry certificates by assigning to them experienced immigration officers.13.    On 9th March the Prime Minister announced in the House(Official Report, cols. 248-55) that a high-level mission - ofwhich Lord Mountbatten of Burma was later named as the leader -would visit a number of Commonwealth countries and discuss with-He was therefore-6-

-7-their governments means of regulating the flow of immigrants to this country, including measures to reduce evasion of thecontrol.     The mission visited Malta, India, Nigeria, Canada,Jamaica, Trinidad and to be^p, Cyprus and Pokist:in.     Lore Mountertten&apos;sreport to the Prime Minister on the mission&apos;s discussions with Commonwealth governments must remain confidential;   hutit can he said that these discussions were most useful in promoting a genuine understanding of Britain&apos;s difficulties and of the need to control the entry of immigrants to oursmall and overcrowded country.

-8-PART IIFUTURE POLICY ON CONTROL OF IMMIGRATIONVouchers1k,    The existing system for the issue of vouchers has &quot;been described in Part I.   Vouchers are currently being issued atthe rate of 400 a week or 20,800 a year.     Since September196h   vouchers have only been issued for Category A (immigrantswith a specific job to come to in this country) and Category B(immigrants with certain special qualifications wr skills).15o    Since there is n&amp;v no prospect of renewing the issue of category C vouchers it has been decided that this categoryshould be discontinued.16.   It has further been decided that, with effect from2nd August 1965, the rate of issue of vouchers shall be 7,500per year.    To give effect to existing commitments entered intobecause of the special problems of Malta, an additional 1,000vouchers will, as a temporary measure;, be allocated to citizens of Malta who satisfy the conditions of the voucher scheme.These special arrangements for Malta will be reviewed after two years.17o   Vouchers will continue to be issued(i)       in Category B to persons with certain special qualifications or skills, as follows:(a) doctors, dentists and trained nurses;(b) teachers who are eligible for the status of qualified teacher in this country;

(c) graduates in science or technology who havehad at least two years&apos; experience in suitable employment since graduation;    and(d) non-graduates with certain professional qualifications who have had at least two yearsexperience in suitable employment sincequalifying;    and(ii) in Category A tc applicants who have a specific jobto cbme to in this country,,    These applicationswill be dealt with in the order of the date oftheir receipt, subject to the provision that notmore than 15 per cent cf the vouchers issued in category A will gc te any one Commonwealth country 018o    The need for immigrant workers from the Commonwealthfor seasonal employment presents a special problem whichwill be dealt with outside the voucher scheme0       furtherannouncement will be made about this in due course.19o    Consideration is also being given to the development ofarrangements under which Commonwealth citizens come to thiscountry for limited periods for industrial training,,    TheGovernment recognise the value of these schemes for the developing countries of the Commonwealth and will do their best to promote them.-9-

Dependants200   The Government propose no change in the statutory right ofthe wife of an immigrant and his children   under 1b to accompanyor follow him to this country      Immigration officers will,however, with a view to preventing evasion, be instructed toapply strict tests of eligibility, and will take into accountwhether the would-be entrant produces on arrival an entrycertificate issued in the country of origin or other appropriatedocuments establishing his or her identity.     An entry certificatewill not be issued unless the head of the household, whetherresident in this country or intending to come in the future,has furnished to the Home Office or, as the case may be, theBritish post in his country of origin, particulars of his dependants in time to enable the information he has given to be confirmed before the entry certificate is needed.,     Forms forthis purpose will be available early in September,,      The HomeSecretary will keep under close review the administrative arrangements as to the evidence that dependants are required tofurnish on arrival, and the Government will seek any necessarylegal powers to make the control effective,21o    The Government have reviewed the present practice of admitting freely children aged 16 and under 18 who are coming to join one or both parents.     In its present form the concession provides a means of securing the&quot;Child&quot; includes a stepchild, an adopted child and, in relationto the mother only, an illegitimate child.-1 0-

admission of young immigrant workers without vouchers, and theGovernment have decided that it must he withdrawn.     The HomeSecretary will nevertheless he prepared to consider individualapplications for the admission of sons and daughters aged 16 andunder 18 whose exclusion would cause hardship.22.    The same considerations apply to children under 16 joininga relative other than a parent or joining a putative father.They have hitherto been admitted if the immigration officer is satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the childto be looked after.     Many have arrived, at or near school-leaving age, simply to enter employment in this country without having to wait for a voucher.     Some immigrants have brought innephews or cousins mf working age in preference to youngerchildren of their own.     The Government have decided that this concession must be withdrawn, although the Home Secretary will use   his discretion to give permission to enter in individual cases when hardship can be shown.Students and visitors23.     The Government will continue to welcome people who &apos;&apos;come from other Commonwealth countries en holiday, social or business visits or to follow a course of studies.     At the sametime it is important to prevent people admitted on the pretextof a visit or a course of study from obtaining permanent settlement.     The Government will therefore continue the present practice of admitting students for a limited period relating tothe duration of the course of study which has been arranged, butgenerally limited to a year in the first instance.     It is also proposed to impose on visits by Commonwealth citizens a time limit of up to six months, which will be freely extended ifgood cause is shown.Evasion cf the control24.,   The CommonwealthvImmigrants Act at present exempts certainclasses of Commonwealth citizen - returning residents, voucher-It--confidential   x

holders, and wives and dependent children - from the    &quot;        1.^-^imposition of conditions of admission.     There are someindividuals claiming to fall into one of these categories -dependants, in particular - about whose bona fides the immigration officer may feel doubt without having sufficiently strong grounds to make him feel justified in refusing admission.The Government propose to seek a general power to imposeconditions on the admission of any Commonwealth citizen who is subject to control.      This power would be exercised with ..discretion and would not be used in any way to imposeunnecessary restrictions on people with a clear right of admission for permanent residence.25.   If a person admitted to this country for a limited periodremains here after that period has expired, it is difficult,very often impossible, to trace him.     An alien admitted for alimited period longer than three months is normally requiredto register with   the police in the area where he is going to stay, depositing a photograph, and to keep theminformed of any change in his address or employment.     TheGovernment do not consider it necessary or appropriate tcimpose a similar obligation on all Commonwealth citizenstemporarily resident in this country, or on any particularclass such as visitors or students.     There are, however, someindividuals in these or other classes who the immigration officer has good reason to suppose are unlikely to comply withtheir conditions of admission unless they are subject to some further supervision.     The Government propose to seek power foran immigration officer to include among the conditions on whicha particular Commonwealth citizen is admitted .one requiring himto register with the police.      This power, again, would beexercised sparingly and with discretion;   but it should be a valuable check on the minority who seek to evade the law,-12-

Repatriation26.   At present a Commonwealth citizen may he deported only ifa court has made a recommendation to that effect on convictinghim of a crime punishable by imprisonment.     This rule ensuresto the person concerned the open consideration of his case by a judicial authority, with a right to be heard in his own defence;but there are disadvantages in this limitation on the HomeSecretary&apos;s power.     Not all the facts may be before the court,which may therefore refrain from making a recommendation in acase where it could otherwise have done so.     Different courtstake inconsistent views of similar cases, so that of twoimmigrants equally undesirable the Home Secretary may be able to repatriate one but not the other.      There may be evidence - of conduct or activities falling short of criminal - which clearlypoints to repatriation but cannot be made the basis of a criminal charge.27.    The Government regard it as important that there should bea speedy and effective power to repatriate immigrants who in one way or another evade the stricter control over immigration thatis now envisaged.     Without it the effectiveness of the control would be greatly weakened.     If a person has obtained entry bymisrepresentation or has flouted the conditions on which he was admitted, there is little point in bringing him before a court for punishment as a criminal.     To vindicate the law it is bothnecessary and sufficient, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, to repatriate him with the least possible delay.28,    It is therefore the Governments intention to seek fer theHome Secretary a general power - in addition to his power toact on the recommendation of a court - to repatriate a commonwealth citizen if he considers the public interest torequire it.     This power, like the existing power of deportation,would be limited to Commonwealth citizens resident here for less-13-

CONFS0ENT8AIthan five years.      If an alien whom the Home Secretaryproposes to deport, otherwise than on the recommendation of acourt or on security grounds, has been lawfully resident inthe United Kingdom for more than two years, he has since 1956been given an opportunity to make representations to the ChiefMetropolitan Magistrate, who then advises the Home Secretarywhether or not a deportation order should be made,&quot;    the finaldecision rests with the Home Secretary, who has so far alwaysacted in accordance with the Chief Magistrate&apos;s advice..     TheGovernment propose that the oppornunity to make representations to /the Chief Magistrate/7 against repatriation in similar circumstances should be accorded to a Commonwealth citizen whohas been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for more than six monthsoHealth29&quot;    Immigration has not created a serious public healthhazard;    and such problems as have arisen in the areas whereimmigrants have settled have been due in the main to diffi-culties of adaptation to new conditions, and to disease beingcontracted after arrival rather than brought in.30.    There have, however, been instances of infectious disease,especially pulmonary tuberculosis, being brought into thecountryo     Where the necessary legal powers were available,the Government have tried to prevent thiso     In 196k, as aresult of medical inspections carried out at the ports 66persons (60 aliens and 8 from the Commonwealth) were refusedentry on medical grounds.     Where the power to refuse entrywas not available, as in the case of the dependants of commonwealth immigrants, the Government have sought to secureearly treatment in the area of settlement0     With this aim,measures have been taken, in collaboration with port and local-1k-

-     144health authorities and general practitioners, to secure thatan immigrant gets on the list of a family doctor immediatelyafter arrival, is medically examined and has an X-ray if the doctor thinks this advisable.31 *    These arrangements were improved at the beginning of thisyear when, among other measures, X-ray apparatus was installedat London AirportJ   and It is the Governments intention tomake further improvements in the health checks at ports of entry-32.    It has been decided that in future an immigrant should normally be expected to produce evidence of having undergone a medical test in his own country - both as a wise precaution and because this should reduce the risk of our having to refuse the immigrant entry at our ports.   Because of the absence of thenecessary legal powers it has not hitherto been possible tobring dependants of Commonwealth immigrants fully within thearrangements for medical inspection at ports.    The Governmenthave now decided that an additional power should be taken sothat, at the discretion of the immigration authorities, anyimmigrant, including dependants, may be medically examined atthe port of entry and may be required as a condition of entry to this country to report to a Medical Officer of Health witha view to necessary medical treatment being arranged.    There will however be no question of refusing entry on medical grounds toentitled dependants and powers will not be taken to do this.33&apos;    Medical tests abroad will take time to organise in collaboration with the other Governments concerned, and legislation is needed before new conditions can be attachedto entry.    The necessary preparation will be put in hand, andthe new arrangements introduced over a period.-15-

INTEGRATIONPART III3h*    The United Kingdom is already a multi-racial society and commonwealth immigrants make a most valuable contribution toour economy.    Most of them will stay and bring up their familieshere and there can be no question of allowing any of them to beregarded as second class citizens^   At the same time it is onlyhonest to recognise that the presence in this country of nearly one million immigrants from the Commonwealth with differentsocial and cultural backgrounds raises a number of problems andcreates various social tensions in those areas where they have concentrated..    If we are to avoid the evil of racial strife andif harmonious relations between the different races who now formour community are to develop, these problems and tensions mustbe resolved and removed so that individual members of every racialgroup can mingle freely with all other citizens at school, atwork and during their leisure time without any form of discrimination -nation being exercised against themewhere the social services are already under strain35&apos;    The concentration of immigrants in certain urban areas/has arisen partly at least because these are the areas where mostjob opportunities existo    The difficulties Yvhich arise in these areas fall broadly under the four headings of housing, education,employment and health..Housing36,    Large numbers of Commonwealth immigrants are living- in conditions which are unsatisfactory, which present serious problems for the local housing authorities, and which lead totension between the immigrants and their neighbours0    The main reason for this is that the areas where Commonwealth immigrants,among others, have settled are those where the housing shortageis already most acuteo   Commonwealth immigrants do not cause thehousing shortageo    It existed before they began to arrive in large numberso-16-

-17-CONFIDE NTI AC37&quot;    The Government endorse the strongly held view of theCommonwealth Immigrants Advisory Counci^ that it would he wrong to give special treatment to immigrants in housing matters.   the sole test for action in the housing field is the quality and nature of housing need without distinctions based on the origin of those in need.   The solution must lie in a determined attackon the housing shortage generally and particularly on the shortageof accommodation to rent on reasonable terms.   The Governmenthave already announced that a much larger part of the housing programme, in the form of a higher proportion of local authoritybuilding, will be devoted to providing rented accommodation for those whose housing need is most acute.    This development in policy will itself benefit the immigrant section of the community.380    The fact that in the more thickly populated parts of thecountry it will take many years to overhaul the housing shortagedoes not mean that no immediate action is possible to relieve the immigrants&apos; housing problems and to assist in their integrationinto the community.   Local housing authorities already have a wide range of powers, which, if judiciously used, can make a major contribution to this end.   As time goes on, immigrants willqualify for rehousing by local authorities either by virtue of residential qualifications or through beinf displaced by slum clearance or other redevelopment.   Thus it will become commonplacefor Commonwealth immigrants to be rehoused by local authorities inpursuance of their normal statutory responsibilities.   This initself will tend to break up excessive and undesirable concen-tration.39.   More immediately, housing associations can play a part in providing accommodations for immigrants and in the process can help to promote their integration.   Local authorities will, it ishoped, do their utmost to assist and promote housing associationswhich have integration.as one of their aims.*First Report - Cmnd. 2119

14&apos;1kO,    The main cause of unsatisfactory living conditions among      3?immigrants is the multiple occupation of houses    originallydesigned for only one family.   The limited powers available underthe Housing Act I96I to improve conditions in such houses were somewhat strengthened by the Housing Act 196k.    But when this legislation was framed, the gravity of the problem was not fully realised,,    The Minister of Housing and Local Government istherefore examining the powers with a view to making them more effective,    Birmingham City Council has already taken power in local legislation to require registration of houses   beforemultioccupation begins.   The need for legislation to extendsimilar or additional powers to local authorities generally isnow being considered.Educationkl.    The educational problems in areas where there is a concentra-tion of immigrants were considered in a circular (No,7/65)issued by the Department of Education and Science on lkth June,1965o    The circular makes a number of suggestions which are setout in the following paragraphs.k3.   Within the schools, most of the difficulties arise from thefact that numbers of immigrant children newly arrived from overseas are brought to school without previous warning, oftenknowing little or no English, and ignorant of the normal socialhabits and ways of life in this country.    The main educationalneed of the children from the areas where English is not in common use is to learn the language quickly and effectively, sothat they can join in the normal work of the school, and develop their talents and abilities to the full;    at the same time, itis important that the general standards of the school should bemaintained.    To achieve both these aims requires teaching skillof a high order, supported by administrative and other measures designed to lessen the burden falling on the teachers,-18-confidential n-

1+3o    In order to maintain the standard of education in schoolsattended by large numbers of immigrant children with languagedifficulties special arrangements must he made to teach themEnglish and to &quot;bring them up to the general standards achieved by the other -children.    This will often mean special classes forthe immigrant children for at least part of the day, although fromthe &quot;beginning they should join as far as possible in the normalsocial life of the school and take their place in the ordinaryclasses as their command of English allows.l+l+o    Such arrangements can more easily be made, and the integra-tion of the immigrants more readily achieved, if the proportion ofimmigrant children in a school is not allowed to rise too high.The circular suggests that about one-third of immigrant childrenis the maximum that is normally acceptable in a school if socialstrains are to be avoided and educational standards maintained.Local education authorities are advised to arrange for the dispersal of immigrant children ever a greater number of schools in order to avoid undue concentration in any particular school.1+5.    Special arrangements for the teaching of immigrant childrenwill often necessitate a more generous teaching staff ratio inthe schools.    The Department of Education and Science is preparedto increase the teacher quota in areas where special staffingarrangements are required in schools with a high proportion of immigrants.    Though this may not be of much help in areas whichare already seriously short of teachers, a number of authoritieshave been able to make use of the services of part-time teachersto good effecto1+6.    The burden on the teachers can also be relieved by theemployment of more welfare and clerical assistants to help inthe social training of the immigrant children and to establish a link between the school and the home.-19-

117*   Arrangements have been made or are under discussion forthe provision of special courses of trainings both for Englishteachers of immigrant children and for teachers and potentialteachers among the immigrants themselves.    Some of the latter,although possessing paper qualifications, are not employable asteachers here because of their inadequate English and theirunfamiliar!ty with modern teaching methods in this country.    Itis proposed that the first full-time courses for immigrantteachers should begin early in 1966;   provision of part-timecourses is also being considered.U8o   Adult immigrants, who come to this country to work in a variety of jobs, also need courses, most of all in English, sothat they can learn to communicate with English people, but alsoin the customs, practices and traditions of this country whichit would be to their advantage to adopt.    Many local educationauthorities are already taking a keen interest in providingappropriate courses, although in some areas attendance is not always well maintained.    The Department&apos;s circular suggests an intensification of these efforts by authorities, and looks to employers, trade unions and all others concerned to encourageand support them in any way they can.    In particular, authoritiesshould bring their educational facilities to the attention of immigrants by providing publicity leaflets and. notices for displayat local employment exchanges and in other places likely to befrequented by immigrants.    They should also seek the co-operationof leaders of local immigrant communities and associations inmaking facilities known to their members.U3&apos;    Increasing interest is being taken in the now problems that have become evident in the teaching of immigrants, and many people feel the need for further research and for the developmentof new materials and teaching aids.    In addition to research-20-

which is already in progress and the experimental use in some areas of such aids as language laboratories;, discussions aretaking place about the possibility of using the resources of educational broadcasting both television and radio, to stimulateactive interest among the immigrants themselves, and to promotetheir integration within the community.50.     Service by young people, not only overseas but also to thecommunity in this country, is an accepted and growing feature of the youth service.    The co-ordination of this activity isnow being considered by a Committee of the Youth ServiceDevelopment Council. Service with immigrant communities isalready undertaken by some young people, and its development isto be encouraged.51.   As time goes on, further local and regional courses and conferences will be arranged by local education authorities todiscuss all aspects of the education of immigrants, and to assist in the co-ordination of the work being done by the authorities themselves and by voluntary liaison committees and other groupson which immigrants are represented.Employment52.   The great majority of immigrants are fully employed, working in a wide range of occupations in many industries.    nevertheless there are indications that, in certain respects, discriminationstill persists.-21-

CONFIDENTIAL53*     This complex issue   is   being tackled in a number of       151effective, if unobtrusive, ways.   First there is the work of theEmployment Exchanges.    The Government make   it a rule that an employer who attaches discriminatory conditions is not to be helped by the Exchanges to fill vacancies if it appears thathe is acting out of personal prejudice and that he is intransigent.But indications of discrimination in notifying vacancies also give the Exchange the chance to make a positive contribution byfinding out what is at the root of the trouble so that they cantry by persuasion and reasoning to ease the way to a better understanding and attempt to overcome any difficulties that mayexist.    In this way considerable progress has already been made and will continue to be made.    The Youth Employment Service hasalso been making vigorous efforts to help Commonwealth immigrantschool-leavers to obtain employment and training suitable to theirabilities on equal terms with other young people, and these effortshave met with a welcome measure of success.   The Trade unions have declared themselves unequivocally against discriminatorypractices.    Many of them have promoted valuable educationalactivities for immigrants themselves or to help others tounderstand immigrant problems.    There is scope for collaboration between managements and trade unionists, especially at the locallevel, in developing mutual understanding between immigrants andthe host community at the work place   and the Government intend to do everything possible to forward this process.Health54&apos;   Any discussion of immigrants and the health services mustbegin with a recognition of the valuable contribution made byimmigrants towards the staffing of these services.    the efficient running of our hospitals in particular, depends in nosmall measure on the service given by doctors, nurses, domesticsand other staff drawn from all parts of the Commonwealth.    TheGovernment gratefully acknowledge the essential contribution they make to the well-being of the whole community, and are glad tofeal that those who later return home obtain experience herewhich will be of value to them in their own countries.-22-COMFSDEMTIAl *^

-23-CONFIDENTIALX 5 ^55&quot;    This paper has already described measures which theGovernment propose to take to require immigrants to produceevidence of having undergone medical tests in their own country,to improve health checks at our ports of entry and, where necessary,to make reference to a Medical Officer of Health, with a viewto obtaining necessary medical treatment, a condition of entry.It must, however, be recognised that even with the introductionof these measures, many immigrants will, for a variety of reasons,continue to impose a relatively heavy burden on the health services.    Their needs are different in degree rather than in kind but they require the special attention of the responsibleauthorities even though the general objective must be to meet them in the same way as the needs of other citizens.56.   There is first  of all the general problem of communication.Many immigrants speak no English and some of them are illiterate;this means the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time by the staff who have to deal with them.    Much can be done by theemployment of suitable members of the immigrant communitiesthemselves to work as health visitors, home nurses or midwives,welfare officers and home helps or to assist local authority and hospital staffs in other ways.57&quot;    The main problem presented to local authorities is thedetection and prevention of tuberculosis.    The incidence of the disease has been found in several areas to be appreciably higheramong Asian immigrants than in the rest of the population.    To alimited extent the disease has been brought by the immigrantsthemselves but its incidence is for the most part the result oftheir living conditions in this country.    Local authorities havebeen active in arranging for chest X-rays for adult immigrantsby miniature radiography or otherwise, and for tuberculin testing

-24-confidential  ^and B.C.G? vaccination of children.,    Medical Officers of Healthwere advised in April by the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministryof Health to apply these arrangements to all immigrant children and to newly arrived adults (with X-ray and supervision ifnecessary for positive reactors)o    B.CoG. vaccine for these purposes is supplied free by the Ministry of Health.,580    One of the main pressures that Commonwealth immigrants exerton local hospital facilities arises from the fact that their poorhousing conditions are unsuitable for home confinements and thatthis leads to a heavy demand for hospital maternity beds.    Thehospital building; programme is currently under review by regional hospital Boards, and this will take account of all the factors,including the presence of immigrants, which are relevant to theprovision of a hospital service.    Since the resources availablefor hospital building are not enough to meet present needs, itwill be necessary for Boards to determine priorities in order to deploy those resources in the areas of greatest medical need ofthe population of an area as a whole, without discrimination.,The hospital building programme should thus ensure that the adequacy of the hospital service in a particular area will not depend on the country of origin of its population.,    It must,however, be recognised that there may be pressures on hospitals in certain areas for several years until the necessary hospital building schemes can be planned and executed.59o   A special problem is that of the care of the young children of immigrant mothers who are at work.    Child-minding is sometimesarranged in unsuitable surroundings and in unsatisfactory care.Local authorities were asked in April to review their arrangementsfor inspection and supervision and to report to the Minister ofHealth by 31 st July.

60.    The Milner Holland Committee drew attention to the unfor-unfortunate consequences of the fact that Commonwealth immigrantsarrive in this country with very little knowledge of housingconditionsj of the rights and duties of landlords and tenants inthis country, and of the pitfalls which lie in the way of unwaryhouse purchasers.    Similarly, there are many other aspects of life in this country which immigrants have difficulty in understanding,for example their rights and responsibilities under the provisionsof our various health acts.   A number of local authorities alreadyproduce leaflets on various subjects in different languages andthe Government are examining the need for supplementing this material by centrally-produced leaflets or in other ways.Financial assistance for local authorities61.   At present the main local services which may be underpressure in areas where immigrants have settled (housing,education and health) are assisted either through the general grant or by specific subsidies or grants.    The formula by whichthe General Grant is distributed is related to the populationof each local authority area and is weighted to take account,among other factors, of the proportion of old and young (includingschool children) in the population.    Thus if the total (or the child) population in an area is increased for whatever reason,the normal machinery will take this into account in. distributingthe grant to local authorities for them to use according to localneeds.   In the case of housing, subsidies and grants from theExchequer are directly related to specific local authority projectsso that increased capital expenditure by a local authority in this field will automatically attract increased Government assistance.62.    In some areas, however, the local authority will need toundertake special commitments, for example, the employment of extrastaff, in order to ease those pressures on the social services which arise from differences in language and cultural backgroundand to deal with problems of transition and adjustment.   Where needcan be shown, the Government propose to give such local authoritiesspecial financial help towards expenditure incurred for these purposes.-25-confidential information

Voluntary Liaison Committees63&quot;    None of the difficulties referred to above will be resolvedwithout a positive effort on the part of all concerned, especiallylocally in those areas where immigrants have settled in substantial numbers;   but such effort needs to be properly directed.    TheGovernment are much impressed by the importance of the work being done to this end by certain voluntary committees which provide thenecessary focal point in their areas for the co-ordination of effort and a channel for the exchange of information, ideas and experience.   Above all they help to create a climate of mutualtolerance in which the stupidity of racial prejudice cannot survive.6k.   The committees have a variety of names.    Several are (tailed&quot;International Friendship Councils&quot;;    other names are &quot;commonwealth citizens Consultative Committee&quot;, &quot;Council for the Welfare of coloured Citizens&quot;, &quot;Co-ordinating Committee for Work amongCommonwealth Immigrants&quot; and so on.    For the purposes of this white Paper they are described as voluntary liaison committees.Regional Committees ,65.    In some areas regional committees have been formed to co-ordinate information, experience and ideas.    There are at presentthree such regional organisations, the Immigrants Advisory committee set up by the London Council of Social Service for the London boroughs, the Commonwealth Welfare Council for the West Midlands,and the Yorkshire Working Group on Immigrants set up under the auspices of the Yorkshire Council of Social Service.National Committees66.   At the national level the Commonwealth Immigrants AdvisoryCouncil under the chairmanship of Lady Reading was appointed by theHome Secretary in 1962 to advise him on any matters which he,mightrefer to it from time to time affecting the welfare of commonwealth immigrants in the United Kingdom and their integration into thecommunity.   On its recommendation the National Committee for commonwealth Immigrants was set up on 1st April 196k.-26-

67.    The work cf the National Committee consists largely in providing advice and   information.    It also has an Importantfunction in   assisting in the formation of local liaisoncommittees and regional organisations.      On the 1st April, 1965,the National Committee held a meeting cf representatives fromthe voluntary liaison committees at which there was generalagreement on the need for the full exchange of information and advice and of the desirability cf regular meetings ofrepresentatives cf the liaison committees under the auspices cfthe National Committee.Conditions forjsuccess68.   To he successful liaison committees must satisfy threeconditions.     First, the whole enterprise must be regarded asa joint project in which immigrant and   host community are bothfully involved.      Second, although they are essentially the product of voluntary effort,  the committees must have the fullbacking of the local authorities, who snould not only support them in principle but should also take an active part in their work, give them adequate financial   help and where necessaryprovide somewhere for them to ineet.      Third,  the committeesmust be non-sectarian and non-political.      They must include representatives of, or maintain close association with, all themain religious bodies and political parties and as many aspossible of the various local   organisations, both statutoryand voluntary.The functions cf Voluntary Liaison Committees69.    The work of voluntary liaison committees falls under three main headings - information, education and welfare.-27*

70.    Accurate information about the situation in a particular area is necessary if effective work is   to be done.     Gircum-stances vary from place to place and it is an essentialfunction cf a voluntary liaison committee to identify accuratelythe main problems which exist in its ov/n area and to proposepositive measures for their solution.71 .    Voluntary liaison committees should take steps to promotepublic education.     Many cf the social tensions which existarise from   ignorance and a readiness to believe unfoundedrumour.     A voluntary liaison committee can provide a forumin which people of different racial origins can meet to discuss their difficulties and learn tc understand each   other &apos; sbackground and traditions   and where the structure of Britishsociety can be explained to the immigrants.     Much can be deneby sponsoring inter-racial projects of an imaginative kind andby encouraging immigrants tc make full   use of the vocationaland educational facilities available to them and to take afull   share in public life.72.    Voluntary liaison committees can also usefully helpimmigrants with personal welfare problems but an importantprinciple to be borne in mind is    that the object should beto help immigrants to use the ordinary facilities cf social service provided for the whole community.      It would be a mistake to build up any permanent form of special service for immigrants which would encourage and perpetuate separatism.73.    Under the Race Relations Bill, local conciliation committees will be set up by a central Race Relations Beard to enquire into complaints of racial discrimination.     Their functions must-28-

however he distinguished from those of the voluntary liaisoncommittees whose function is essentially the co-ordination cflocal effort and the positive promotion of goodwill, not the implementation   of the statutory requirements of the race relations Bill.The future74.    The Government recognise that local conditions   vary considerably and that complete rigidity   of principle andstandardisation of organisation are neither possible nordesirable.     The present system ie flexible and this flexibilityshould continueo     The Government believe, however, that thereis a need for closer co-ordination   of effort   on a national basis and in particular a need for some tangible evidence ofGovernment support for the existing network of voluntaryliaison committees and for the creation of additional committees in other areas   where substantial numbers of commonwealth immigrants have settled.75.    The Government intend to establish a new National Committeefor Commonwealth Immigrants  -which will be composed of individuals who are able to bring special knowle ge and experience to hoar on the   problems arising from commonwealth immigration.   This - 111 replace the exiatl-i - National Committee.Its   finances and staff   will be such that    it will be able to expand existing services to the voluntary liaison committeesand the regional   organisations.      The need for a widersharing cf experience has clearly been shown and it isimportant that the new National Committee should be able tobuild up a comprehensive body of doctrine which can be flexiblyapplied to a variety cf local situations, extend the range ofexisting information work, organise conferences cf workers inthe field, arrange training   courses, stimulate research andthe examination by experts cf particular problems, and generallypromote and    co-ordinate effort on a national basis.-29-CONFIDENTIALn

76.    The Government take the view that the work of the national committee should not he directly under Government control since its main stimulus must come from the harnessing cf voluntaryeffort, and a degree cf autonomy is necessary if the Committeeis to remain free from party political influence and otherpartisan pressures;   hut the Government propose to maintainclose liaison with the work of the Committee and to associateitself fully with the    Committee&apos;s   efforts.77*    The Governmeiit consider it cf tne first importance that each voluntary liaison committee should he served by a trained,full-time, paid official who should be the direct servant ofthe committee.     As evidence cf its wish to give tangiblesupport to the committees,  the Government is prepared, on certain conditions, to make a grant towards the salary of suchan official available to each voluntary liaison committeethrough the National Committee.      The first condition will bethat the voluntary liaison committee concerned can demonstrateto the satisfaction of the National Committee that the personthey propose to employ is fully competent to carry out theparticular work which he or she will be called upon to perform.Secondly, such a grant will be available where the localauthority concerned provides adequate office accommodation andsecretarial support for the official appointed.    .V&apos;here theseconditions are satisfied, voluntary liaison committees alreadyemploying a suitable officer will be eligible to apply forthe proposed grant.      It will be one of the functions of theNational Committee to assist in the recruitment and trainingof suitable officers where they are not otherwise availableto the local committee.-30-

78.    The Government wish to pay tribute to the valuable workof the Commonwealth Immigrants Advisory Council since itsformation in 1962.      Its members, under the chairmanship ofLady Reading, have devoted much time to the study of questions affecting Commonwealth immigrants and have produced threeimportant reports*;       &quot;but with the arrangements made forco-ordinating Government activities relating to the integration of Commonwealth immigrants (Official Report;    9th March,columns 2^8-2Li-9), with the proposals for a new national committee for Commonwealth Immigrants and   with the general increase in the last few   years of study and research into thevarious problems which have   arisen, tne role of the Councilneeds to he re-examined,79.    The Government consider that the advice which the council has hitherto made available to the Government can in thefuture be most effectively provided as part of the work ofthe new National Committee and therefore intend that thefunctions of   the Council should   new be included in thoseof the new committee.Conclusion80.    The good name of Britain, our relations withother members of the Commonwealth, and, above all,  justice and common humanity, demand that Commonwealth immigrants in thiscountry should be absorbed into our community without friction and   with mutual understanding and tolerance.    The government believe that the good sense of the British people will prevailand that this will be achieved,,      The above paragraphs outlinesome of the steps which the Government will take to speed theprocess;    they are sure that in this effort they   will be ableto rely on the full co-operation of all the national organisations,local authorities and voluntary organisations concerned and ofthe immigrants themselves.* Cmnd. 2119, 2266, 2458

ANNEX draft STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT policy the Government have had under review the whole subject of commonwealth immigration, including the control of entry into theUnited Kingdom and the integration of immigrants in this country intothe community.     A White Paper covering both these aspects is being issued this afternoon.2.     The Government have had the advantage of Lord Mountbatten&apos;sReport on his Mission to the Commonwealth countries principally concerned, and the discussions which were held with some commonwealth prime Ministers when they were recently in London.     We recognise the very valuable contribution that workers from other parts of theCommonwealth are making to industry and the staffing of our social services; and visitors and students from other Commonwealth countries are always welcome here.     But nearly everyone, both in this countryand in the Commonwealth as a whole, appreciates that there is a limit to the number of immigrants that this small and overcrowded country can absorb.     We have come to the conclusion that new measures arenecessary if that limit is not to be exceeded.3 .    The Government have decided that there must be a reduction in therate at which vouchers are issued to enable Commonwealth citizens tocome here for employment and, as from today, the rate will be reduced from 26,880 a year to 7,50i a year.     In addition, however, atemporary allocation of 1,000 vouchers a year, to be reviewed after two years, will be made available for Maltese workers in view of our special obligations to Malta.     Applications will continue to be entertained under Category B of the scheme for persons with certain special qualifications or skills, though on a more restricted basisthan in the past.     The remainder of the vouchers will be available under Category A, that is for workers who, whatever their-1-

qualifications, have specific jobs to come to, subject to a limitationof 15 per cent on the share of those to be issued to any oneCommonwealth country.     No vouchers have been issued since september 1964 to applicants in Category C, i.e. the category for persons who wish to work here but do not qualify under Categories Aor B, and it has now been decided that no further vouchers will beissued to applicants in this category.4.     We propose no change in the present statutory rights of wives andchildren under lb to accompany Commonwealth immigrants to, or join themin, this country; but, save in exceptional circumstances, we are withdrawing the present concessions enabling any child aged 16 but under 18to join a parent, and any child under 16 tc join a close relative otherthan a parent, in this country.     With a view to preventing evasion,immigration officers will be instructed to apply strict tests ofeligibility, and will take into account whether the would-be entrantproduces on arrival an   entry certificate issued in the country of origin.5-     It has also been decided that in future immigrants should normally be expected to produce evidence of having undergone a. medical test intheir own countries.6.     We shall also seek a wider power in the coning session to securethat, at the discretion of the immigration authorities, any immigrant,including dependants, may be medically examined at the port of entryand may be required as a condition of admission to report to a medical Officer of Health with a view to medical treatment being arranged.7.     In addition, we shall seek new powers to combat evasion of thecontrol, including an extension of the Home Secretary&apos;s power to repatriate Commonwealth citizens.8.     It is a cardinal principle of the Government1s policy on commonwealth immigration that immigrants have exactly the same rightsand responsibilities as any other citizens.-2-

9.     At the same time it is only honest to recognise that the presence in this oountry of a nunber of immigrants with differing cultural and social backgrounds, and in particular their concentration in a fewareas where there is already a housing shortage and pressure on thesocial services, has given rise to a number of difficulties.     The main problems are referred to in the White Paper under the four broadheadings of housing, education, employment and health.     There is nodramatic short-term solution to any of them, but we are determined todo what we can to speed up the processes whereby commonwealth immigrants are fully accepted into our community and the present difficulties are resolved.10.   We recognise that there are certain special pressures on thesocial services in some areas not just because of an increase in numbers but because of differences in language and cultural background.These special difficulties can require the employment of additional staff who can, for example, speak one or more of the immigrants&apos;languages or who can do the extra work involved in providing a link between the school and the immigrants&apos; homes.     Where the need canbe shown we shall be prepared to give financial assistance to localauthorities who employ such staff.11.    The key to removing social tensions lies in action at the locallevel in which the local authority, the voluntary organisations andthe immigrants themselves are all fully involved.     The Governmenthave been much impressed by the valuable contribution being made by voluntary liaison committees in certain areas.     The Government hopethat similar committees will now be set up in other areas whereimmigrants have settled but where no committees as yet exist..    as evidence of our intention to encourage these committees in their workwe shall be prepared, on certain conditions, to make a grant availableto voluntary liaison committees towards the salary of a trained,full-time, paid official.-3-

12.   While recognising that local conditions vary, the government consider that there is also a need for closer co-ordination of effort on a national basis.     To this end we propose to establish a new national Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants which will replace theexisting National Committee and which will be composed of individuals who are able to bring special knowledge and experience to bear on theproblems arising from Commonwealth immigration.     It will be the function of the new committee to co-ordinate the work of voluntarylaision committees, to. extend the range of existing information work,to organise conferences, arrange training courses, stimulate research and the examination by experts of particular problems and generally to promote and co-ordinate effort on a national basis.13.   The Government wish to pay tribute to the valuable work of theCommonwealth Immigrants Advisory Council under the chairmanship ofLady Reading.     We have, however, decided that the advice which theCouncil has hitherto made available to the Government can in future be most effectively provided as part of the work of the new national committee.     We therefore intend that the functions of the council should now be included in those of the new committee.1A-   The Government are determined to ensure that commonwealth immigrants are absorbed into our community without friction andwith mutual understanding and tolerance.     We believe that we shallbe fully supported by public opinion and can rely on the full co-operation of all the national organisations, local authorities and voluntary organisations concerned and of the immigrants themselves.-4-
