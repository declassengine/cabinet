1 I io x XOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 12614th September, 1965CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Local government finance, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is circulating a memorandum(C.(65) 125) on the grant system in which he has given a broad outline ofthe plan, and has indicated that the members of the ministerial committee are not agreed as to the way in which some of the Home office services should be fitted into the new scheme.    I accept the general lines of the scheme but am strong&apos;y of the opinion that room must befound within its framework for &quot;c ntroi grants&quot; for certain services where firm and immediate control from the centre is vitally important.The object of this paper is to set out the Home Office case for suchgrants for the police, child care and fire services.Police2,       The difference in principle between police and other serviceswhose cost is shared between central and local government is that thepreservation of law and order and the maintenance of the Queen&apos;s Peaceare not local government functions.    Police officers are officers of theCrown and not servants of the local authority, and it is essential that theGovernment should retain effective control over the service to ensurethat efficient police forces are maintained and that there is no localinterference with the enforcement of the law.    The Police Act 1964 hasincreased the powers of the Home Secretary in several important respects, but it v/as drafted on the assumption that financial sanctions would be available, if necessary, to enable the Home Secretary to carryout his general duty under the Act to promote the efficiency of the police.For example, it does not include any general power of direction, even insuch an important matter as the control of establishment, and if a police authority fails - as sometimes happens.- to make adequate provision byway of establishment, the Home Secretary can take action only bythreatening to withdraw or reduce the police grant.3,      Even where the specific powers of the Home Secretary have been increased under the Police Act 1964, action in the courts would be an extremely cumbrous and slow means of exercising the necessary control -for example, if an authority wished to continue the appointment of a deputy as acting chief constable for a considerable period in order tocircumvent the Home Secretary1 s refusal to agree to his appointment as chief constable.    Experience shows that without a specific grant in the background controls of this kind are in fact not exercised.    An examplewithin the field of the Home Office is that, although a chief fire officercannot be appointed without the Home Secretary&apos;s approval, in practiceCOPY NO.   6 i)THE GRANT SYSTEM

the absence of a specific grant as an effective sanction has meant thatsuccessive Home Secretaries have felt inhibited from exei-cising in the fire service the close degree of control which has been found necessaryfor the police.4.       With the growth of regional and national as distinct from localcrime, the general tendency is to expect the Home Secretary toexercise a steadily increasing degree of control of the service, withinthe general structure of partnership with police authorities and chief officers.    To drop the percentage grant at this stage would be taken asan indication that the Government was retreating from the position taken up with the passing of the Folice Act 1964, and was intending to allowpolice authorities their head to a much greater extent.    This would be quite inconsistent with the needs of the situation and would be severely criticised in Parliament and elsewhere.    It would be very unpopular with the men themselves, who look to the Home Office to intervenewhere necessary with backward authorities.5.       There can be no doubt that if the specific police grant were abolished there would be a rapid falling off of efficiency in some forces.Expenditure on the maintenance of an efficient police force can never beas immediately popular as expenditure on social services such as housinghealth and education;  and experience shows that in certain areas it isonly the knowledge that the grant sanction is there in the background thatensures that the police get their fair share of the money available.    Afalling off of efficiency in some localities would very much strengthen thecase for a national service.6.      For these reasons I am convinced that what is at issue is not justa question of rating policy or of financial relations between centred andlocal government, but the whole future of the police.    Without the cpecifigrant it will be impossible to secure the development of the service onthe lines envisaged by the Royal Commission and generally endorsed byParliament and public opinion;  and in present circumstances, withgrowing public concern about the increase in crime, we ought not tomake a change which will jeopardise progress in strengthening andmodernising the police service and carry serious risks to the efficientmaintenance of law and order.Child Care7.       In &quot;The Child, the Family and the Young Offender&quot; published asa White Paper (Cmd. 2742) on 24th August, 1965, the Government set outprovisional proposals for practical reforms to support the family, to forestall and reduce delinquency, and to revise the law and practicerelating to offenders up to 21.    In order to implement the proposals, the child care service of local authorities will have to be re-organised and expanded to -(i)  establish and staff family councils;(ii)  take over duties corresponding to those now performed by the probation service for children under 16;(iii) develop an expanded service of social case-workers to dealwith children taken into care, or placed under supervision and their families;

9..       I believe that the resumption of an ad hoc grant is needed for the fire service, partly to re-establish essential central control of its organisation, standards of efficiency and conditions of service, andpartly to enable me to induce fire authorities to undertake long overduedevelopments in the field cf fire prevention.    But I ask only that this possibility should be kept open.    I am proposing an independent inquiry into the fire service;  and the right time to review the grant position willbe when the report of the inquiry is available.Conclusion10.      I invite the Cabinet -(i)  to approve retention of the existing specific grant for police;(ii)  to approve the re-introduction of a specific grant for the childcare service during the period when the proposals of the white paper are being implemented;(iii) to leave open for reconsideration, after the report of theproposed independent inquiry has been received, the re-introduction of an ad hoc grant for the fire service.Home Office, 3. W. 1.13th September, 1965(iv) develop a system of observation centres where children canbe assessed before the family council considers treatment;(v)  take over and expand many of the approved schools run by voluntary organisations and run them as homes providingcare and training appropriate to children of different types.8.      I do not believe that these important developments can beeffected without the stimulus and sanction of a special grant.    some local authorities may show the necessary enthusiasm and accept thenecessary guidance.    But many will have to be induced to do what isnecessary;  and if proper standards are to be achieved strong centraldirection will be essential.    I am quite satisfied that without the incentive of a special grant, and the authority which the payment of sucha grant would give rne, I cannot implement our new policy satisfactorily.I should of course be ready to look at the matter again once the new service had been satisfactorily established.Fire
