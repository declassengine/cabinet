Meanwhile,Ministers may like to have the attached copies of the records of mytalks with Mr. Smith.    I need not emphasise the secrecy of theserecords or the delicacy of the situation in which we now find ourselvesa situation in which we and the Rhoclesians have failed to agree butthey have not yet committed themselves tg any illegal action and wehave not, therefore, finally broken off relations with them.    In thesecircumstances it is imperative that we should refrain from any publicaction or statement which they could regard as provocative;   and i therefore ask all Ministers to abstain from any public reference tothe Rhodesian problem in the immediate future.H, &apos;V7..10, Downing Street, S. &quot;V7.1.I1&amp; October, 1965

AG-REED NOTE of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W.1at 3.00 p.m. on THURSDAY, 7th OCTOBER, 1965PRESENT:Tho Prime minister the Hon. I.D. Smith,Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia the Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the Hon. W.J. Harper,Minister of Internal AffairsThe Minister of State for commonwealth relations the Hon. D. Lardner-Burke,Minister of JusticeSir Burke TrendThe Hon. J.J. Wrathall,Minister of FinanceMr. G.B. Clarke,Secretaryto the CabinetTHE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it might be most convenient to begin by summarising the position -which had been reached as a result of thediscussions between Mr, Smith and the Commonwealth Secretary on 5th and 6th October.ICR. SMITH said that it was now essential to bring matters to the pointof final decision, not least in view of the damaging impact of uncertaintyon the Rhodesian economy.   The Government of Southern Rhodesia, as it thenwas, had agreed to attend the Victoria Falls Conference two years before onthe assumption that the question of Rhodesian independence would be settledas soon as, or perhaps even before, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasalandwas dissolved.   He understood that the United Kingdom Government did not accept this contention.    But, however,that might be, the Rhodesian hopes hadbeen disappointed;    and tho Rhodosian Government had now reached a point atwhich they could not afford to wait any longer.The discussions which ho and his colleagues had had with theCommonwealth Secretary on the previous two days appeared to have set thingsbaok rather than to have advanced them,   For example, it seemed that theUnited Kingdom Government no longer regarded the 196l constitution as an acceptable basis of Rhodesian independence - whereas it was widely assumedthroughout Rhodesia that, when this constitution was negotiated in I96I, itconstituted the basis on which the country would proceed to sovereignindependence.   Again, the Rhodesian Government had been allowed to believe

that the United Kingdom insistence on a blocking mechanism related to theentrenched clauses in the constitution (where it would replace the existing provision for a. referendum);   but it now appeared that this mechanism was required for the type of normal constitutional amendment which theGovernment could effect at present by means of a two-thirds majority in theLegislature.     In other words, the United Kingdom Government appeared tobe imposing, as conditions of independence, fresh stipulations in relationto the management of the internal affairs of Rhodesia as well as to theconduct of her external policy.   Whether the 196l constitution had impliedsovereign independence or not, it had certainly implied that the Governmentof Rhodesia would be free to manage their own internal affairs as they sawfit;   but the changes which were now being proposed would give them lessinternal freedom than they had at present.The United Kingdom Government seemed to be concerned only with the africans in Rhodesia, not with the Europeans.    If so, they were proceeding on purely racial lines.   The proposal for a blocking mechanism in the formnow put forward was clearly tailored to African needs;    and, since oventhe blocking third (if the Rhodesian Government were prepared to concede it)would provide only a narrow margin of safeguard, it must be increasedAfrican representation which was the United Kingdom Government&apos;s realobjective.    But this was a quite different matter.As an alternative to the referendum for the entrenched clauses the rhodesian Government had offered a Senate which, although they had originallyconceived it as consisting partly of Africans and partly of Europeans, theywere now prepared to envisage as composed wholly of Africans, provided thatthey were Chiefs.   In the two Houses sitting together these twelve Chiefs,with the fifteen African &apos;B&apos; Roll members of the Legislature, would constitute a blocking third.In addition, the Rhodesian Government were prepared to concede virtuallyuniversal adult suffrage on the &apos;B* Roll itself, to the extent of addingabout 1 million African voters to that Roll.    These, from Rhodesia&apos;s side,were read concessions.The United Kingdom Government had felt unable to accept any of theseproposals;   and the Rhodesian Government had now to ask themselves, therefore,how this gulf, which was widening rather than contracting, could be bridged.They could not go on as they were.   They realised that unilateral action would constitute a very grave decision and they had analysed the consequencesvery carefully.   But it could cut both ways;    and, in any event, it wouldbe better, whatever its implications than merely acquiescing in a pro-gressive decline of European standards.   This was a matter of life and death-2-

for the Europeans in Rhodesia since the only alternative they saw to independence was their eventual departure.   In this respect the decision which they faced was not wholly unlike the decision winch the UnitedKingdom had faced in September, 1939.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked Mr   Smith for speaking so frankly.   Hewould try to be no less candid.    It would be premature, however, to discussthe implications of unilateral action at this point, since it was something which we must all seek tc avoid.   But as regards the substance of the issues involved the Commonwealth Secretary should now put the case as the UnitedKingdom Government saw it.THE COMOHsflSALTH SECRETARY said that his discussions with Mr. Smithand his colleagues he.d been conducted in a frank and cordial spirit on bothsides.   But they had reveoded two basio differences between the Governments:-1.     On the constitutional issue the Rliodesian Government had maintained their claim that the 1961 constitution was, in effect, an independenceconstitution.   But the facts contradicted this claim.   It &apos;would be possibleto verify, by means of a referendum of the four racial groups as providedfor in the constitution, whether any particular sot of constitutional proposals was accepted by the people of Rhodesia as a basis for indepen-dence;   but the Government of Rhodesia, were anxious to eliminate the referendum procedure on the grounds that it was too cumbrous and laboriousand proposed, instead, to institute a Senate as an alternative safeguard forthe entrenched clauses of the constitution.   It was clear to the UnitedKingdom Government, however, that this Senate, in the form proposed, wouldnot suffice as a. substitute for the protection afforded by the existing machinery.   In return for a transference of power they would requireadequate safeguards to ensure that the I96I constitution would provide themoans of making that unimpeded progress to majority rule which was one ofthe five principles on which the United Kingdom Government were bound to insist.   Moreover, ordinary changes In the constitution (as distinct fromany amendment of the entrenched clauses) would, in their opinion requireadequate safeguards after independence;    and it was in this context that hehad suggested a blocking third.   But on this point, the Rhodesian Governmenthad felt unable to agree.2,     In addition, there was tho difficult question of racial discrimination.In one sense only full adult suffrage would solve that problem;   in itsabsence it was essential to be able to point not only to adequate consti-tutional safeguards but also to some dramatic forward move in relation&quot;to e.g. the Land Apportionment Act.   But the Rhodesian Government had feltunable to make any significant concession on this point.-3- 5 G fe

9 o n3 0 the PRIME MINISTER said that those were serious differences of view.The whole of the United Kingdom&apos;s record of de-colonisation illustrated and confirmed their insistence on majority rule as a condition of independence.In interpreting this, in the case of Rhodesia, as reasonably speedy progress towards majority rule they had already made a major concession to the rhodesian Government;    and they could have little hope of satisfying publicopinion, not only in the House of Commons but also in the rest of theCommonwealth and in many foreign countries, unless they could demonstrate that the final settlement was consistent with the five principles in whichthey had sought to summarise the basic conditions of Rhodesian independence.It vrould be difficult enough to justify these principles to world opinion;but it should not be impossible to present them convincingly, provided thatthey were fully observed.   How did we now stand in this respect?   Forexample, the first principle required that &quot;The principle and intention ofunimpeded progress to majority rule, rlroady enshrined in the 1961constitution, vrould have to be maintained and guaranteed&quot;.     But how far ahead, in the opinion of the Rhodesian Government, did majority rule lie?And how long v/ould it be before it was achieved?MR. SMITH replied that the principle of progress towards majority rulewas indeed enshrined in the 1961 constitution.   The Rhodesian government accepted this and did not wish to detract from it.   But, if the Africanscontinued to boycott the constitution, it was impossible to say how longit would be before the principle was realised.   Indeed, he was bound to say,speaking frankly, that this would be a lengthy process;   it was something which it would be dangerous to rush.   Nevertheless, if tho Africans wouldembrace the opportunities which the 1961 constitution offered them, theywould ultimately achieve majority rule.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that if the Africans did co-operate in working the constitution, the rate of their political advance would presumably depend on the speed of their progress in acquiring the necessaryeducational and economic qualifications.    Could Mr. Smith predict how quicklythe educational and economic betterment of tho Africans would yield majority rule?MR. SMITH replied that several estimates on this point had been made,varying from fifteen to fifty years.   No one could be dognatic.   He was notprepared to hazard an opinion.   The Rhodesian Government would think itwrong to accelerate the educational advance of the Africans simply in orderto improve their political status in the community,   Tho question of their economic position different matter.

THE MINISTER OF STATE enquired about the facilities for the secondary education of Africans.MR. SMITH replied that there was no problem here;    indeed, there were more vacancies in African secondary schools than in their Europeancounterparts.MR. VffiATHALL added that it was untrue that the Rhodesian Treasuryprovided loss finance for African than for European secondary education.It night not be possible to give either all that it asked for;   but, insofar as abatements had to be ma.de, there was no question of cutting the Africanprovision more severely than the European.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it appeared to be clear that, on the basisof the 196I constitution, the rate of African educational advance at presentenvisaged by the Rhodesian Government would not yield majority rule withinthe next few years.MR. SMITH agreed;   indeed, the Rhodesian Government would oppose anydeliberate acceleration for this purpose.MR. HARPER added that it was European enterprise which basicallyfinanced African education;    and the type of constitutional change whichwould alarm the former would therefore harm the latter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if this was so and if the same considera-tions applied as regards the economic qualifications which on African mustacquire before being entitled to the vote, would the Rhodesian government consider adopting a more direct route towards majority rule by means of a simple widening of the franchise?MR. SMITH rejected this suggestion because it would imply revertingto the position which had obtained a few years ago when. European sentimenthad become thoroughly alarmed and Europeans had begun to leave the countryin significant numbers.   Ho must make it clear that the Government Partyin Rhodesia did not believe in majority rule.   They accepted that the 1961constitution would eventually bring it about;   but they would not take any action to hasten this process.   The criterion of fitness for majority rulemust be a criterion of merit, i.e. a criterion in&apos; terms of those standards of civilised behaviour r.which other independent African countries were notsucceeding in observing.315RET

q Q KO *?THE HUME MINISTER observed that the Rhodesian G-overnment must notsuppose that the United Kingdom G-overnment were not as concerned to safeguard the Europeans as much as the Africans.   But how did we stand as regards thesecond principle, namely that &quot;There would also have to be guarantees againstretrogressive amendment of the constitution&quot;?ME. SMITH said that, as regards the entrenched clauses, the provision whereby an amendment could be approved by The Queen on the advice of theUnited Kingdom Government would, of course, lapse on independence,   Thealternative - i.e. amendment by referenda of all four races - was a clumsyprocedure and was open to the further objection that it involved a highlyinvidious process of assigning individuals to different racial groups.Moreover, all four groups must vote in favour of any amendment;   but, giventhe racial distribution within Rhodesia, this implied that 1 per cent ofthe population (e.g. the Asian group) could block an amendment which theother 99 per cent might regard as desirable.   It was for these reasons thatthe Rhodesian Government had put forward the alternative suggestion of aSenate.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the Senate was envisaged as votingseparately from the Legislature and, therefore, as exercising in some sensea veto. &apos;MR. SMITH replied that it would be preferable that both Houses shouldvote together and that a, two-thirds majority should be required for an amendment.   The Senate of 12 Africans, together with the 15 African &apos;B&apos; Rollmembers, would total 27, i.e. an effective blocking third.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the African members of the Senatewould be elected,MR. SMITH said that they would not.    They would be Chiefs, appointed in accordance with the tribal system.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that, in that case, it could not be saidthat there would be any democratically elected block to prevent retrogressiveamendment of the entrenched clauses.   This was not something which the UnitedKingdom Government could justify either to the House of Commons or to inter-national opinion.-6-

SECRET      1 3 mr. LARDNER-BURKE said that the Rhodesian Government had reached their conclusion about the size and composition of the proposed Senate after a verycomprehensive review of Second Chambers, which they had carried out with the help of the Commonwealth Relations Office Legal Adviser,   It had become clearthat the functions to be exercised by the Senate would tie relatively limited,partly because the constitution already provided a safeguard for normalconstitutional amendments (by means of the two-thirds majority procedure)and partly because the Constitutional Council would remain as an activeelement in the constitution.   It followed that the only function of the senate would be to provide, with the *B&apos; Roll members, a blocking safeguard against retrogressive amendment of the entrenched clauses;    and for thispurpose a Senate of 12 Africans appeared sufficient.THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the British Government consideredthe entrenched clauses to be protected by the referenda of the four racialgroups.   They wanted the blocking third as an additional protection forother clauses.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if the Senate was envisaged as abalancing factor in relation to the Lower House, the extent to which thelatter was itself democratically elected was very relevant.   He appreciated the difficulties which the Rhodesien Government saw in the referendumprocedure.   But, if some other form of safeguard was to be substituted for it, everything would depend on the method by vdiich the individuals whowould constitute the blocking factor were selected.THE LORD CHANCELLOR added that it would be impossible for the UnitedKingdom Government to accept for this purpose individuals who, like theChiefs, wore not elected but were paid servants of the Rhodesian Government.Why could not the Rhodosian Government accept, for ordinary constitutionalamendments, a simple blocking third in the form of 26 &apos;B&apos; Roll seats - asthey had appeared ready to during the visit which he and the commonwealth secretary had paid to Rhodesia earlier in the year?-7-

MR. SMITH replied by pointing out that the existing constitutionalready required a two-thirds majority for ordinary constitutionalamendments.THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed but emphasised that Rhodesia was not yetindependent.MR. SMITH asked why the United Kingdom Government could not accept ablocking quarter.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that tho reason was that there must surely be some increase in African representation.MR. SMITH said that that was a different question.   The Africans hadalready rejected the opportunities of representation which the existing constitution provided;    and there was therefore no ground for enlargingthese opportunities,THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the Rhodesian Government would change their view if the Africans were disposed to co-operate in working the1961 constitution.MR. SMITH said that the Africans would first have to prove that theywere ready to do so;   and this could only happen after independence whenthey had been given a chance.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could see some merit in the concept of a Senate;   but it must be more elective in character.MR. SMITH replied that, if so, it was for the United KingdomGovernment to show how this was to be achieved.

SECRET qJ b oTHE PRIME MINISTER repeated   that the Senate must he capable of beingregarded as one element in a blocking safeguard which was essentiallyelective in character,THE MINISTER OP STATE added that what was at issue was something whichwould replace the referendum. It must therefore be something which was atleast as &quot;strong&quot; as the referendum itself.MR. HARPER replied that the referendum was too cumbersome a procedure.The alternative must be something which essentially provided a basis ofreasoned discussion among informed people and did not put at the mercy ofpolitical considerations changes in the constitution which might, on meritsbe desirable.THE PRIME MINISTER ebserved that the concept of the Senate -was aningenious one;   but, if it was to go forward at all, the Senate would haveto be elected on something like the *B* Roll.     He suggested that discussion should next turn to the third principle, namely that &quot;There would have to beimmediate improvement in the political status of the African population&quot;.MR. SMITH said that the implementation of this principle   depended on whether the Africans would take advantage of the opportunities already provided by the 1961 constitution.     It was impossible to go further withouta lowering of the franchise - although the Rhodesian Government would beprepared to put the *B* Roll virtually on the basis of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;by adding nearly a million Africans to the Roll.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that this would not give the Africans anymore seats in the Legislature.MR. SMITH said that, nevertheless, cross-voting, which the rhodesian government were no longer pressing to eliminate, would allow the inoreased,Bt Roll element to influence !A&apos; Roll voting, at least in marginal cases.THE MINISTER OP STATE pointed out that the second and third principles should be considered together, in the sense that, if the rhodesian government were prepared both to envisage an increased number of African seats in the Legislature and to constitute the proposed Senate from electedAfricans, the result would not merely be improved safeguards againstretrogressive amendment of the constitution but a.lso an increase in Africanrepresentation as well.MR. SMITH replied that the Rhodesian Government had considered these issues very carefully but could make no further concessions.SECRET    N--9-

THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY pointed out that the United Kingdom Governmentwere prepared to contemplate the grant of independence before majority rulewas actually achieved.    This was a very major concession.    Would not the  .Rhodesian Government make some parallel gesture?MR, HARPER said that the United Kingdom concession was not new.     Ithad been made not by the present Government but by their Conservativepredecessors.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that this might be so;   nevertheless, itvra.3 the present Government who would have to meet the domestic and inter-national criticism if they conceded independence to Rhodesia on anindefensible basis.He suggested that they should now consider the fourth principle, i.e.that &quot;There would have to be progress towards ending racial discrimination&quot;.In this context the future of the Land Apportionment Act was clearly acritical issue.mr. SMITH said that, as regards this Act, things were movingcontinuously.     Already 3 million acres of land which had formerly beenEuropean had been made available to the Africans;   but only a small part had as yet been taken up by Africans.     The Act was of yalue in protecting the africans from exploitation.     Africans were grateful for this, and itsrepeal would harm them more than the Europeans.     As regards racial discrimination -naticn in the towns,     the Rhodesian Government were presently consideringseveral multi-racial areas.     It was significant that the objection in one case had been made by a Coloured Rhodesian, not a European;   nevertheless,the Government intended to go ahead.THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Land Apportionment Act had been criticised by the Constitutional Council.     Could not the rhodesian government at least admit publicly that its repeal was desirable in principle?MR. SMITH replied that they had already said that they would be readyto consider withdrawing certain parts of it as and when it seemed desirableto do so.THE MINISTER OP STATE asked whether more could be done to openSalisbury to the Africans?MR. SMITH replied that the Rhodesian Government were currently examiningwhether that part of the Salisbury trading area which was adjacent to the Kopjecould be made a multi-racial area.

THE COMQNVffiALTH SECRETARY asked whether the attitude of the BhodesianGovernment in relation to e.g. the University, the Medical School, theprivate r-ohools, etc. was defensible in terms of progress towards a multi-racial society.MR. SMITH said that, as regards the schools, it had been brought to notice that they had been breaking the law in admitting African pupilswithout the permission of the Minister.     The Government were now consideringthe position;   and, in any event, there was evidence that this type of changemade for a worsening of racial relations rather than for their improvement.MR. HARPER added that it was up to those who wanted multi-racialeducation to provide it;   nothing would be done to prevent them.     But itwas unreasonable that existing private schools for one race should be turned into multi-racial schools without the consent of the parents concerned.MR. LARDKER-BURKE said the Rhodesian Government had just approved thecreation of a multi-racial teachers&apos; training college, run by a group ofmissions in Pulawayo.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, even so, the Rhodesian Government*attitude seemed to raise the same issues as those which had just been foughtout in Alabama.MR. SMITH replied that the circumstances were not the same.     Therewere greater differences between European and African standards in Rhodesiathan in the United States.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if so, this might perhaps be thought tobe a reflection on the ex-tent to which Rhodesian Governments had providedfacilities for African education.MR. SMITH replied that the Europeans had been in North America atleast six times as long as they had been in Rhodesia.     Even so, thestandard of African education in Rhodesia was higher than ii many otherAfrican countries.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the United Kingdom had neverthelesa feltjustified in granting independence to those other African countries.MR, SMITH replied that the consequences spoke for themselves.Tanzania was now little more than a Chinese puppet..11-SECRET   -n

MR. LARMER-BUTtKE asked whether, if the Rhodesian Government repealedthe Land Apportionment Act, the United Kingdom Government would agree thatthey should also throw open the Tribal Trust Areas which had been entrenchedin the 1961 constitution?THE COMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that what mattered was that thegeneral impression of racial discrimination within Rhodesia must be removed by some positive signs which vrould convince international opinion thatdiscrimination was really being progressively reduced.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there remained the fifth principle,namely that &quot;The British Government would need to be satisfied that any basis proposed for independence was acceptable to the people of rhodesia  a whole&quot;.     The Conservative Government had felt unable to accept the concept of an indaba, which Mr. Smith had proposed in September, 19&amp;f;   andthat concept was equally unacceptable to the present Government of theUnited Kingdom,     Could the Rhodesian Government offer an alternative?MR. SMITH suggested that it was necessary to settle the first fourprinciples before dealing with the fifth, i.e. to decide the content of theproposals to be submitted to the people of Rhodesia before deciding how theyshould be consulted.     Nevertheless, the Rhodesian Government continued tothink that the proposals which they had made in 19,64 were adequate;   andthere was some reason to believe that the Conservative Government wouldhave accepted them if the Rhodesian Government had felt able to enlargethe scope of consultation to include not only the Chiefs and Headmen butalso the Kraal heads of whom there were 30,000 - a step which, on furtherconsideration, they had felt unable to take on the grounds that it would tendto undermine the authority of the Chiefs themselves.     What alternativecould the United Kingdom Government suggest?THE PRIME MINISTER asked why the referendum procedure in theconstitution should not be used?     If a referendum had been regarded, inthe context of the 1961 constitution, as essential for the amendment ofone entrenched clause, it was a little difficult to see why anything lessshould be thought to be adequate to ascertain the vri.shes of the people asregards the constitution as a whole.MR. SMITH replied that the reason was simply that, as he had already pointed out, 1 per cent of the population could nullify a referendum.     Inaddition, he must repeat that it was an extremely cumbrous process to implement;   and the assignment of individuals to their racial groups was amost invidious business.-12-S EC RET  n

9 Q secret o dMR. HARPER added that the fact that the 1961 constitution hadincorporated the concept of an appeal to The Queen as an alternative to a referendum was a tacit admission of the defects of the referendumprocedure.     It had had to he embodied in the constitution for political reasons;   but the alternative of an appeal to The Queen had also had to beincluded, since everyone had known that a referendum was in factunworkable.THE PRIHE MINISTER said that, although a referendum might be difficultto work, it could not be literally unworkable since it had been acceptedelsewhere in Africa in relation to constitutional advance and the same principle would shortly be put into effect in the case of the changes inthe constitution of Mauritius.     How could the United Kingdom Governmentjustify conceding independence to Rhodesia on the basis not only of a constitution which v/as less liberal than other independence constitutionsbut also of a means of verifying Its acceptability which was less liberalthan the methods adopted in other eases?-MR, HARPER said that it must not be forgotten that all the citizens of rhodesia were members of one community;   and the fact that only some ofthem enjoyed the vote did not detract from this basic principle of unity,which was exemplified by a common voters&apos; roll.     Allowance had to be madefor two distinct standards in Rhodesia,THE PRIME MINISTER replied that it remained true that only some ofthem had the vote,MR, HARPER said that the reason for this was simply that the Africanswere not as advanced as the Europeans. But the Rhodesian Government were making great efforts to improve the status of Africans.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this merely meant that, although thecountry was alleged to be ready for independence, it was apparently not ready for democracy.MR, SMITH replied that the United Kingdom did not have full democracyuntil the twentieth century;   and by that time education was universal,THE MINISTER OP STATE asked whether, if some 1 million Africans were added to the !Bt Roll, and tA* and rB&apos; Rolls together might provide thebasis of a referendum?MR, SMITH said that he could not accept this proposal.     The simplechoice between two candidates, which v/as all that a voter had to exercise inan ordinary election, was one thing;   and It was something which was withinthe compass of the average African.     The decision on the complex issues ofan independence constitution was a very different thing;   it involvedsophisticated judgments which^heordinary African could not comprehend.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, nevertheless, the ordinary African couldsurely say ^es1 or ^o&apos;.MR. SMITH replied that the ,ordinary African simply would not understand what he was being asked to decide.     This fact had been tacitly recognised in the 196d constitution, when the vote had been granted to the Chiefs butnot to the other Africans.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the United Kingdom Government could not accept this view.     It was now clear, therefore, that the two sides were very far apart on all five principles.     Only the concept of a Senateoffered some possibility of advance, although even here there was still agreat gulf between the opposing views.MR, HARPER said that the United Kingdom Government must remember thatthe 1961 constitution gave the Rhodesian Government powers in relation tothose elements in the population about whom United Kingdom opinion was now exercised.     The Rhodesian Government already had those powers;   and thefinal step of conceding sovereign independence would not really make so verymuch difference as regards the realities of political and constitutional advance within Rhodesia.MR, SMITH added that the United Kingdom Government&apos;s effective decision could be argued to have been taken even earlier - in 1923, when they gaveSouthern Rhodesia the option (on the basis of the European vote alone) of becoming a self-governing Colony or joining an independent South Africa.But what was to be done now?THE PRIME MINISTER   replied that the position -was now very critical -and its implications extended far beyond &quot;Rhodesia itselS.   He suggested that both sides should reflect on the exchanges of the day and resume thediscussion tomorrow.MR. SMITH said that he did not object but he would like to have theUnited Kingdom government&apos;s considered views and their proposals on how thesituation should be resolved.     It was clear that the two Governments weredrifting apart rather than narrowing the gap between them;   and there was no advantage in any further delay.     The Rhodesian Government had learnt thislesson as a result of the Victoria Palls Conference;   if they had refused toattend that Conference, they would have had their independence by now.-14-

6 9 [ATHE PRIME MINISTER agreed that we should avoid any unnecessary delay.Nevertheless, it would be wise for both sides to reflect on their positionsbefore they considered what their respective attitudes should be if itprored impossible to reach agreement.It was agreed that the discussion should be resumed at 2.30 p.m. onFriday, 8th October, 1965.London, S.W.1October, 1965.-15-

AGREED NOTE of a M(IE of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1at 2.30 p.in. on FRIDAY, 8th OCTOBER, 1965PRESENTThe Prime minister the Hon. I.D. Smith,Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia the Lord chancellor the Hon. W.J. Harper,Minister of Internal AffairsThe Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the Hon. D. Lardner-Burke,Minister of JusticeT&amp;o Minister of State for commonwealth relations the Hon. J.J. Wrathall,Minister of FinanceSir Burke trend . G.B. Clarke,Secretary to the cabinet mr. P. rogers mr. K.J. NealeTHE PRIME MINISTER opened the discussion by saying that there had, inhis view, been at the previous meeting a very clear examination by both sides of the five principles.     He wondered if, after further reflection RhodesianMinisters had anything to add.MR. SMITH said that he had been disturbed to read in the British press reports which suggested that the Rhodesians were to blame for refusing tomeet the British Government on any of the five principles.     This was adistortion of the facts.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Press briefing on the British side had notgone further than an admission that the discussions had been cordial and frank but that the two sides were very far apart.MR. SMITH said that he had not much to add about the substance of thediscussions.     The Rhodesian Ministers had made most of the running and hethought that their position was clear.     He had hoped that, as a result ofthe adjournment, the Prime Minister for his part would be able to clarify hisown position.-1-

THE PRIME MINISTER sail, that the United Kingdom Government had made their position clear.   They had spoken frankly on each of the five principles;   and on each the gap v/as still very wide.   He had said, insumming up on the previous day that a basis had not been found on whichthe United Kingdom G-overnment could recommend Parliament to grant independence to Rhodesia.   He had felt that the distance between the two sides might be a little less on the third principle (about racial discrimination -nation) than on the others, since, although there was apparently noquestion of the repeal of the Land Apportionment Act, Mr. Smith had indicated certain proposals which might offer the prospect of some progress.His impression, therefore, was that disagreement on this point was not asabsolute as on the others, where the differences were very wide indeed.There was clearly no early prospect of majority rule;   and, in so far as thematter lay in the Rhodesian Government&apos;s hands, there was no intention to do anything to accelerate the education of the Africans for this purpose.Rhodesia might be pressing on with education for Africans generally;   butthis v/as not for political reasons but in recognition of the intrinsicdesirability of education.   The United Kingdom G-overnment could notcountenance a transfer of sovereignty on the basis of so slender a guarantee of early majority rule.   So far as safeguards were concerned, the concept of the Senate was the result of a good deal of thought and reflection;but it did not incorporate the principle of a Vlooking safeguard constitutedfrom elected representatives of the majority raco.   In order to satisfythis requirement all 12 members of the Senate would have to be elected.Without that guarantee the safeguard would be inadequate;   and even on that basis it would be difficult to justify to the House of Commons and inter-national opinion, including the rest of the Commonwealth (which did not mean,in this context, only the African members).     At the recent commonwealth prime Ministers&apos; Meeting there had boon a lnng end serious discussion on this problem.     The views expressed had been strongly and sincerelyfelt;   and he had been pressed very herd by aH mdmbers of theC omnom/ealth.*m r.\ ftQ b 0

On the question of the political status of Africans the 01 0 eRhodesian proposals were, again, insufficient.   The suggestion which the Rhodesian Ministers haft put forward for a considerable expansion of the fBl Roll was helpful;   hut it was not decisive and.would not provide any more seats for Africans.     As regards the fifth principle it hai to he recognised, that what was in question waslegislation to provide for independence which would not he on thebasis of immediate majority rule.   This made it all the more essentialthat the people of Rhodesia as a whole should be completely free tosay whether thev were content with the proposed basis of independence.In every case in which independence had been granted in recent years the views of the population as a whole had been ascertained onclearly-stated terms of independence;   and in every case this hadbeen on the basis of majority rule.   When, in the unique case of rhodesia, there was a proposition that independence should begranted before majority rule was achieved it was doubly necessarythat the method employed should extend beyond the existing electorate,even if enlarged by the addition of one million African taxpayers tothe TBl Roll as had been suggested by Mr. Smith.   But he had understood from Mr. Smith that it would be unacceptable even to extend the franchise as far as that for the purposes of a referendum.   He didnot believe that any British Government could recommend independence on the basis of the methods so far suggested.   That, in s\immary, wasthe position as he saw it.     THE COffiONWEALTH SECRETARY and THE LORJCHANCELLOR indicated their agreement with the Prime Ministers summing up of the position.MR. SMITH remarked that what the Prime Minister had said might beaccurate in terms of a purely academic appreciation of the position;but the Rhodesians had to bo practical and realistic.     They looked at thecountries to the north which had received their independence;   and they saw that there was now no such thing as democracy.     In Ta.nz.onia therehad been only one candidate for President and only one political Partyat the recent election.     In Zambia, where the United Kingdom Governmenthad thought that they had provided for the protection of Europeaninterests by the provision of 1reserved&apos; seats for Europeans, thosewere now being called in question.     Rhodesians wore living cheek byjowl with situations of this kind.     He understood the British Government *difficulties and problems;   but, from what the Prime Minister had said,the two sides wore further apart than over.     They now hod to face up tothe practical consequences of what lay before thorn.     He felt that theUnited Kingdom Government were new not ready to go even as far as their predecessors had gone,THE PRIME MINISTER replied that this was not so.     The previous government had never accepted the method of consulting the populationof Rhodesia as a whole which the Rhodesian Ministers had proposed.

secret i       ^orTHE COMQJWEALTH SECRETARY said that, as regards the one method whichhad been suggested, namely the Indaba of Chiefs, and Headmen, the previous government had said &quot;no&quot; and so had the present Administration.MR. SMITH replied that at any rate the two sides were clearly asfar apart as ever.   When he and his colleagues returned to Rhodesia theycould do nothing but face up to what they considered the only alternative.The question, therefore, was how this could be implemented in a way whichwould cause the least trouble to both parties.THE PRIME MINISTER said it would be tragic if an irrevocable decision was taken without full realisation of all the facts.   So many tragediesin world hi story had been caused by a failure fully to appreciate inadvance the possible consequences of particular courses of action.MR. SMITH said that his Government were not unmindful of the implications for Rhodesia.   It was unnecessary to rehearse them againor to embark on an argumemt about which side could do more harm to theother.   He was anxious to avoid bitterness.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that there was no need to exchangethreats and that he need not go in detail through all the statements which had been made by the United Kingdom Government; but it was essentialthat the Rhodesian Government should realise that they had been made notmerely for the record but in all seriousness.   Last October*s statementstill represented, clearly and categorically, the position of the UnitedKingdom Government.   But it was not merely a question of the action whichthe United Kingdom Government might take in circumstances in which aRhodesian Government was purporting to rule without legal authority;   it wasalso a question of the consequences in a wider international context, whichthe United Kingdom Government might be powerless to prevent.   These mightbe far graver than anyone realised.   The United Kingdom Government had maintained in the United Nations that they were responsible for Rhodesia(despite the fact that the country had had internal self-government since1923); but, if the Rhodesian Government took action which implied that theywere purporting to govern the country illegally, there was no saying what other Governments and the United Nations might do, regardless of the-A-

SECRET -        399United Kingdon attitude.   The Rhodesian Government night set relatively little store by the United Nations; but they nust reckon with the factthat, in the present state of feeling, that Organisation night takeirmiediate action, which night not be confined to econonic neasures.   TheUnited Kingdom government had their own views as regards the adrdssibilityof the use of nilitary force by the United Nations.   Nevertheless this possibility could not bo ruled out; nor would it necessarily be merely amatter of the Afro/Asian reaction.   In that event other countries might also become involved.   Efforts right, and no doubt would, be made toprevent this from happening.   But we could not be sure that these would succeed, however much we might deplore it.   He begged Mr. Snath toconsider the situation which might develop if pressures for military action proved irresistible.   Mr. Smith had no doubt formed his own assess-nent of what night happen in Rhodesia.   He had seen Mr. Smith1s televisionbroadcast on the previous evening; but ho had also seen the Lord Chancellor&apos;broadcast, in the course of which the Africans talcing paid; had said thatthey would fight.   No doubt Mr. Smith had considered this possibility; but such action might eventually set tho whole of southern Africa, and even a wider area, ablaze.   The Rhodesian Government night not desire this; butthere night be no means of preventing it.   Moreover, the passions whichnight be aroused right imperil the position of Europeans in other african countries.   The British people had kith and kin&apos;in those countries; and theterrible things which might happen to then in a situation which night beconeone of genocidal strife wore a natter of very grave concern.   The UnitedKingdom Govemnent would be bound to throw their whole weight against anybodywho provoked a situation of this kind.   This was not merely his view; all his colleagues shared it strongly.   It was a dangerous illusion to thinkthat the situation could be contained within the borders of Rhodesia, whetheror not there was violence in the country itself.   Mr. Smith had perhaps beenright in saying that the United Kingdon Government were remote fronrealities of the position in Rhodesia; but perhaps the Rhodesian government themselves were not as closely in touch with international opinion as theUnited Kingdor..   They did not seen to realise the irresistible passions-5-

which might be aroused, whether as the result of what might be described as an orderly intervention by the United Nations or otherwise.     the rhodesian G-overnment had no doubt considered the position in which theywould find themselves if they were denied recognition by some ninetynations;   but had they considered the more indefinable consequences ifwide areas of Africa were opened up to conflict?     The situation in the congo had been dangerous; but at least the United Nations had been ableto prevent the country from becoming a cockpit for the major Powers.But would this be true a second time?     Mr. Smith   would be aware of thedetermined attempts being made by China to penetrate Africa.     It hadbeen realised at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting that a groatstruggle was in progress between the Soviet Union and China for influence in Africa.     Both these countries would be under strong temptation to intervene in Rhodesia, with incalculable consequences.     Here lay a great danger - almost, perhaps, a probability.     He feared a terrible conflictand bloodshed.     ibid, however much we might hope to prevent it, there could be no guarantee that we should succeed.     He apologised for having to speak so frankly;   but it was better to speak now than to wish later that he had.MS.. SMITH said that he was grateful to the Prime Minister for being so frank;   and he appreciated the Prime Minister&apos;s concern for Rhodesia.The Rhodesian Government had, of course, considered every aspect of thesituation, even if the worst should happen;   but they had concluded thatthere was no other alternative for them.     Their country and their liveswere at stake.     If Britain had considered all that might happen to herin 1939, she might not have gone to war.     Rhodesia might be relativelyinsignificant;   but the issues were just as important for her people.If they did not obtain independence, they would ha.ve to leave Rhodesia..They would rather fight it out than go voluntarily.     The consequences towhich the Prime Minister had referred might, or might not, happen.     ThoRhode si an Government would take the chance.     They had analysed thesituation over and over again and always reached the same answer.     It was quite simple;   they had no option,THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that, when Britain had decided to fight in 1939, and to fight on alone in 1940, she had not boon without friends and the whole of the rest of the world had not been against her.     This wasthe difference from the Rhodesian situation.     They would find that theywere opposed not only by those who disagreed with them but by friendlycountries, including members of the old Commonwealth, who would be in sympathy with them in many other respects.

MR. LARDNER-BURKE said that surely the consequences which thePrime Minister had described would stem from the action taken by theUnited Kingdom;   it would be the United Kingdom whose lead would be followed.If the United Kingdom did not take action of the kind in question, the adverse reactions would be unlikely.THE PRIME MINISTER said ho did not agree.     Even if we were to take no action of the kind which we nevertheless thought it inevitable that we shouldhave to take, he feared that others would and that the demands for some formof sanctions would be overwhelming.     We were on record against the use ofeconomic sanctions by the United Nations in the case of South Africa;   butthis situation would be regarded differently in the United Nations.Proposals for military intervention might become equally irresistible,regardless of the United Kingdom&apos;s attitude.     He was in close personaltouch with the Foreign Secretary, who was now in Now York and had formedhis own estimate of the feeling in the United Nations.MR. SMITH said that, if it were proved that any such action by theUnited Notions would do more harm to Africans than to Europeans, logicand commonsense would surely prevail.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that it wasnot a question of logical proof.     However eloquently the case was arguedor however strong the evidence, the sovereign nations who were the membersof the United Nations would take their own decisions.     They -would take thesame view as the Europeans in Rhodesia in the sense that they would regard it as a choice between two evils.     Pie asked Mr. Smith to consider thepossible effect on Europeans in Africa outside Rhodesia, whatever might, or might not, happen in Rhodesia itself.     He hoped he was wrong but he feared that there might be many innocent victims.MR. LARDHER-BURKE said that the right way to look at the problem was tomaintain that the time for action against Rhodesia would come only if, and -when,retrogressive laws were actually enacted.     Such action should not be taken on the mere assumption that this would happen.     MR. SMITH added that the rhodesian people were being denied independence because the United KingdomGovernment thought that they might adopt policies harmful to the Africans,not because they had actually taken such steps.     Would it not therefore belogical to reserve action against Rhodesia until some damage was in fact done to African interests?    He believed that the action of the United kingdom would give a lead to the rest of the world.     It must be obvious that, ifpressure were brought to bear on the Rhodesian Government, they might haveto do unpleasant things.     If economic measures created a recession, theywould first get rid of the half million alien Africans in the country.     Insuch circumstances Europeans could pull in their belts;   but Africans would lose their livelihood and might even be without food.     External opinion should consider these harmful effects which might follow action.against rhodesia.     He wondered whether the United Kingdom Government had askedthemselves whether what they were oroposing to do was right,SECRET s&apos;

THE PRIHE MINISTER said that action by the United Kingdom   would bodictated by the fact that the Rhodesian Government would have seized powerillegally.     But the United Kingdom could not control what action might botaken by others, including tho United Nations.     Indeed, if the United Kingdomdid not react the rest of the world would probably react more strongly.     Thesituation would be explosive;   and the results -would not depend on united Kingdom action.     If there was violence in Rhodesia, it would spread.Measures taken to suppress violence in Rhodesia might themselves trigger offexternal action against Rhodesia,MR. SMITH said that there would be no violence.     There might bo other problems;   but there would be no violence.MR. HARPER said that, basically, both sides wore facing the sanedifficulty in relation to one course of action or another.     People wanted toprotect themselves in advance against something which they thought might happen.But it was wrong to try to poet a problem before it had arisen.     IfRhodesia failed to fulfil its promises the position v/ould be different.Given independence, the checks and balances within Rhodesia v/ould ensure thattho Rhodesian people would behave well.     It was wrong to assume in advance that they would not and so prejudge the issue.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that, even if this view were accepted, whatwas at issue was not what people&apos;s motives were, but what action they v/ouldtoko.     On Mr. Harper&apos;s argument it could equally well bo maintained that the actions of the Rhodesian Government wore dictated not by any current throatto the Rhodesian way of life but by their belief that such a threat nightarise in tho future.     Similarly, other nations v/ould take action, even if only as a result of fears which tho Rhodesian Government believed to bo ill-founded.     Events night then evolve in ways beyond the capacity of either side to control;   and the repercussions might extend even beyondSouthern Africa.MR. HARPER said that the Rhodesian Government were seeking independencebecause of the increasing pressures on the economy. Development and furtherinvestment in Rhodesia would bo withheld until independence was granted.THE LORD CHANCELLOR replied that the reason why further investment wasnot talcing place now was because of the throat of a unilateral declarationof indpondonce.-8-

-9-MR. SMITH said that, so far from the threat of independence constituting a deterrent to investment, the facts were that since Ms Party came to powerthroe years before and began to campaign for independence, investment hadsubstantially increased, even though it was still insufficient.THE LORD CHANCELLOR replied that investment might have increased when there was a prospect of independence on an agreed basis but that the uncertainty which would inevitably arise from any unilateral declaration woulddeter investors.THE PRIME MINISTER added that the City of London were historicallyfriends of Rhodesia but unsettled conditions would not reassure thorn.MR. SMITH said the rate of expansion in Rhodesia was still not adequate for the expanding population. Tho more his Government had pressed the case for independence, the more business confidence had increased. Rhodesia hadgroat resources and the Rhodesian Government had evidence that substantialcapital would flow to the country when investors wore certain of the future.Many who were deterred from establishing thensolves in Rhodesia at presentwould come of tor independence.Moreover, independence was needed not only for economic reasons but also for political reasons.     There would never be unity in Rhodesia until after independence.    At present the African Nationalist loaders looked to the United Kingdom, since the Government of the United Kingdom still had some say we Rhodesian affairs.     But after independence they would realise that theycould not appeal to any external support but must seek a solution with theGovernment of tho country.     The present political situation was unhealthy,with some African leaders under restriction;   only independence would enablethis to be resolved.THE COMHOI-MSALTH SECRETARY said that it had boon the uncertain future ofthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland which had deterred investment in theperiod before Mr. Smith&apos;s Party came to power; similarly business confidencewould now bo adversely affected by the threat of a unilateral declaration.MR. SMITH said that his Government had hitherto assumed that independence was the only possible outcome of their negotiations, whether byagreement or by unilateral declaration.     Was this correct or did theUnited Kingdom Government believe that an alternative lay in the maintenanceof the status quo?

THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he certainly did not believe that, ifterns could not be immediately agreed for independence, the only other courseof action v/as a unilateral declaration.     Ho -and his colleagues would behappy to discuss means by which it would be possible to move forward from thestatus quo.     For example, while the proposals for a Senate put forward byMr. Smith were not acceptable in their present form, the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to consider them further, even though the gulf tobe bridged was a wide one.     Moreover, they recognised the difficulties withwhich the Rhodesian Government were faced as a result of the attitude of african extremists.     The United Kingdom Government, for their part, would do anything in their power to induce African Nationalist leadership to accept that their future depended on political co-operation.     It might perhaps bepossible to contemplate an arrangement whereby African Nationalists, who woreable to show that they enjoyed, popular support, would be brought into theGovernment in a junior- capacity, perhaps as&apos; Parliamentary Secretaries and soobtain over a period experience of the responsibilities of administration.At the sane time there might be a farther drive, in which the United KingdomGovernment would be ready to help, to expand African education in itswidest sense;   and Africans of a suitable standard of education nightreceive special training in administration.     The United Kingdom Governmentwould bo ready to seek to persuade other African Governments to providesimilar assistance.     By such means as these it might be possible to fostera genuinely multi-racial approach to political affairs more rapidly than would be possible on the basis of the operation of the 196d Constitution on existing linos.     Those proposals night seem visionary at present;   but itwas no less visionary to contemplate a successful outcome to a unilateral declaration of independence,&apos;hd:av vj-a- .--o::v^:;^ d: ::;.iV,J:MR.,SMITH replied that it would not be possible for the rhodesian government to contemplate an agreement on the terms which the Prime minister had suggested.     They believed that thoy had boon promised independence onthe basis of the 1961 Constitution;   and they had boon misled.     The only alternative to independence was that the Europeans would seek to entrenchthemselves in their present position.     For himself rather than adopt this alternative, he would probably not remain in public life and might leaveRhodesia.     Those who stayed would be driven to pursue other policiesleading to increasing hostility between the races.     A unilateral declarationof independence would be bettor than this,-10-5Ecr.:r/

secret ,        A nKTHE PRIME MINISTER asked that Mr. Smith and his colleagues should consider further what he had said and should &quot;bear in mind that the views whichho had just put forward were those which ho had also expressed at theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers earlier that year.     Having regardto the serious consequences which might stem from a unilateral declarationof indpendence, would it not he preferable, despite the difficulties, toconsider cadling a Constitutional Conference?     While its outcome might notbe wholly pa.lata.blo to Mr. Smith and his Party, neither was it likely to bowholly palatable to those who desired a consitution based on ir.tf.iediatouniversal suffrage.MR. SMITH replied that the Rhodesian G-overnment was not prepared to contemplate such a Conference.     If Rhodesia could not obtain independence,he would not seek to rer.ia.Inj   and there wore many like him.     He felt thatthey now had no option but to talco their independence;   and there might boadvo.ntage in discussing how a unilateral declaration might be implemented. Ifthe United Kingdom Government felt bound to take certain action, the rhodesian government would have to place themselves in the most favourable possibleposition to counter it.     The extent of their action would depend on theextent of the action taken by the United Kingdom Government;   and they woreready to discuss those questions now.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that it was not possible for theUnited Kingdom Government to discuss how an illegal act might bo carried out.MR. SMITH said that ho had expected such a reply but had felt it rightto make the offer.THE COIffipNWEALTH SECRETARY asked whether the Rhodesian Government mustfinally reject the proposals put forward by the Prime Minister. Was therenot some advantage at least in trying this course?MR. SMITH replied that the Rhodesian Government had given the matter very careful thought and did not now fool able to change their mind.-11-

mr. HARPER said that it must be borne in mind that, just as theUnited Kingdon Government had their own political and Parliamentarydifficulties, so had the Rhodesian Government on their side.     If they wenttoo far to meet the United Kingdom view, they would not be able to canytheir own Parliament and public opinion with them.     It was thellhodosian Government who had the very much more vital difficulties and should therefore be given the benefit of the doubt.     It was their misfortune that   &apos;they had forfeited earlier opportunities to gain their independence;   and,even if they now appeared to be something of an anachronism, it should notbe held against then that they could not change their way of life at short notice to adapt themselves to tho views and beliefs of other countries.THE: PRUjE MINISTER interjected that it was not a natter of hisGovernment being unwilling to face criticism, with which they would, indeed,inevitably be faced both fron the Opposition and to some extent from within their own Party.     But they were not prepared to face Parliament with proposals which they did not boliove to be right.MR. HARPER said that tho proposals which the Rhodesian Ministers had put forward had exceeded the mandate which they had been given in Rhodesia,Yet they had not found that those brought then any closer to tho views ofthe United Kingdom Government.     The objections which United kingdom ministers had expressed did not derive fron their own independent convictionsbut appeared to have boon inherited fron the previous Administration.THE PRIME MINISTER said that ho must make it clear that the attitude which tho United Kingdom Government had maintained was not a natter of party politics;   nor was it inherited fron the Conservative Government.     When in opposition his Party had supported the action taken by tho previous administration in respect of Rhodesia at the 1964- Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers;   and they adhered to that view now because thoy believedit to be right.MR..

. MR. LARDNER-BURKE said that the Rhodesian Government would probablywish to publish as a White Paper the correspondence which had passed betweenthe two Governments since the previous Rhodesian White Paper, -which had carried the exchanges to June, 1963.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if it were proposed to publish the correspondence which the Rhodesian Government had had with the previous administration, it would be in accordance with constitutional conventions inthe United Kingdom that he should seek the agreement of his predecessors whohad been the Prime Ministers of the day.     This he would now do.-13-&amp; n vi the PRIME MINISTER agreed and suggested that the connunique mightfrankly describe the scope of the discussions and indicate what had been said by each side on the five principles.     Beyond that each side would be free to explain publicly the line which they had taken.MR. SMITH said that a lengthy communique of this kind would take aconsiderable time to draft;   and it would therefore be preferable to confineit to a short statement to the effect that the two Governments had been unable to reconcile their differences on the conditions of independence.-The meeting then adjourned while a communique was drafted.     When themeeting reassembled - THE PRIME MINISTER proposed, and MR. SMITH agreed,that it would be preferable to omit the reference in the draft communique tothe consideration which had been given to the possibility of a unilateral declaration of independence.Certain textual amendments were agreed, and the communique was approved in the form annexed to this record.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether it was agreed that the discussions-&quot;- - ;.      - &apos; &quot;&apos;would.now no longer be regarded as confidential and that each side would-     .      ....      . ...     .        .henceforward be free to report to Parliament and to the public on the views which had been expressed and to give a full account of the negotiations.MR.

MR. SMITH proposed that there should he no publication of any record of confidential exchanges during the negotiations, principally his own oralexchanges since February with United Kingdom Ministers through theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Salisbury.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that short of any unilateral declaration of independence 3uch records should remain confidential.In further discussion it was agreed, that the White Papers should be confined to the relevant correspondence.     It would bo preferable that thesame correspondence should be published in white Papers in each country andthat this should bo done simultaneously.     There would bo consultation between the two Governments to that end.     Subject to this understanding,each side would be free to comment publicly on the course of the discussions which had been held during that week, provided there was no attribution of statements to individuals or direct quotation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that ho much regretted the outcome of thediscussions;   but he wished to thank Mr. Smith and his colleagues for thefrankness and courtesy with which they had expressed their views.MR.

AG-KEEP COMMUNIQUEThe Frine Minister and the Commonwealth Secretary have held duringthis week a series of discussions with the Prime Minister and other ministers of Rhodesia, during which they have examined frankly and thoroughlyall aspects of the question of Rhodesia&apos;s independence.     The british ministers have described the constitutional principles which the BritishGovernment would regard as the essential basis on which they could recommend to Parliament the grant of sovereign independence to Rhodesia;    and the rhodesian Ministers have indicated the reasons for which they feel unableto accept these principles in the measure required by the BritishGovernment.     Despite intensive discussion, no means have been found of reconciling the opposing views.     No further meeting has been arranged.-15-

AG-REED NOTE of-a-Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.Yv.1on MONDAY, 11th OCTOBER, 1965 at 10.45 a.m.PRESENTThe Prime minister the Hon. I.D. Smith,Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia the Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the Hon. D. Lardner-Burke,Minister of JusticeSir Burke trend . G-.B. Clarke,Secretary to the cabinet mr. P. rogers mr. K.J. NealeTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he was anxious to clear up any possiblemisunderstandings on either side before Mr. Smith and his colleaguesreturned to Rhodesia,     The previous evening he had had discussions withthe leaders of the Opposition, from which it emerged that there might be one misunderstanding relating to the fifth of the five principles i.e.the need to satisfy the United Kingdom Government that any basis proposed for independence was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.At a previous meeting it had. appeared that Mr. Smith was concerned lest a referendum on the basis of four separate electoral rolls would enable a small minority of the population to veto a change;   and he had explainedthat the Rhodesian Government therefore wished to seek an alternativeblocking safeguard for the entrenched clauses (i.e. other than the final approval of The Queen, as at present, or what v/ould amount to fourseparate referenda).     The Prime Minister v/ished to make it clear thatthe United Kingdom Government had not so far expressed a view on thequestion of separate referenda and that they did not in fact contemplatewhat might amount to four separate electoral colleges.     They had notpursued the issue in discussion because they recognised that Mr. Smithwas in any event opposed to procedure by referendum.     But, in case therewas a misunderstanding, he wished Mr. Smith and his colleagues to knowv/here the United Kingdom Government stood on this point, namely that,on the whole, they v/ould be inclined to support a single referendum.

MR. SMITH said that he recognised the position of the UnitedKingdom Government in this matter.     It appeared that there might havebeen some misunderstanding about what he had said to the leaders ofthe Opposition.     He had made it clear to them that he could not accept four separate referenda;   hut he had never supposed that thiswas what the United Kingdom Government were proposing.     He understoodthat they believed that a referendum on what v/ould be virtually &quot;one man one vote&quot; would be appropriate.       In their earlier discussions the Prime Minister had referred to the procedure in relation to thegrant of independence in the countries to the north of Rhodesia, wherethe United Kingdom Government had insisted on what amounted to a referendum on the basis of universal suffrage even for the achievement of independence on the basis of majority government.     It followed thatthey must be all the more insistent on a similar safeguard for the achievement of independence on the basis of minority government.IKE PRIME MINISTER said that this procedure was not confined toother countries in Africa but represented the general practice of theUnited Kingdom in all previously dependent territories when theyachieved independence.     He v/anted to be quite sure that the view ofthe United Kingdom Government on this issue was fully understood,since in their discussions on a blocking safeguard they had confinedthemselves to considering the proposal for a Senate.MR. SMITH replied that he too was concerned that there shouldbe no misunderstandings.     He had been completely frank in his talk with the leaders of the Opposition and had made the same points tothen as he had made in his discussions with the Government and,subsequently, in his Press Conferences.     He recognised the sincerity of the United Kingdom Government1s views;   but he must neverthelessmake it clear that he and his colleagues believed that the UnitedKingdom Government had moved away from their original position andthat the two sides were now further apart than when they started.

IE :i  &apos; a i p^ J.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was not the oase that theUnited Kingdom Government had moved away from their original position;but it was true that  they had now been more precise than their predecessors about the way in which the general principles of asettlement should be put into effect.One further point had emerged from his own discussions withthe leaders of the Opposition on the previous evening.     This was thatthere had been some reference, when Mr. Smith saw them, to an alterna-tive way of instituting guarantees against retrogressive amendment ofthe Constitution, namely that there might be a solemn treaty betweenthe United Kingdom Government and the Rhodesian Government which wouldbe registered with the United Nations, and, perhaps, subject toajudication by the Privy Council.MR. SMITH said that he would be prepared to accept such a treaty as an additional guarantee (i.e. additional to the guarantees in theConstitution itself) that the Rhodesian Government would honour thespirit of the 1961 Constitution.     They had no intention of going backon this;   but it would not be acceptable to them that the treaty shouldincorporate reservations going further&apos; than the Constitution itself.If it were simply to reinforce the Constitution, they would be happy to accept it.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether this was not a new suggestion,which had not previously been put forward in their discussions.MR. Li*iPJJNER-BURKE replied that there might have been some general reference to it in previous discussions with the Commonwealth Secretary,although possibly not in the form of a precise proposal for a treaty.The idea was conceived as a way of meeting the fear of the UnitedKingdom Government that the Rhodesian Government might, after independ-ence, go back on their undertakings.     He had suggested in tho earlier discussions that it would be more appropriate that the United KingdomGovernment should wait until the Rhodesian Government defaulted ontheir obligations than that they should try to anticipate misbehaviourof this kind.     The concept of the treaty was consistent with this thought.-3-

THE PRIME MINISTER asked what sanctions might he provided in such atreaty.MR. LARDNER-BURKE replied that these night he whatever the UnitedKingdom G-overnment wished.   For example, it might tie the action contemplated in their statements of October, 1964- and April, 1965.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the action contemplated in those statementswas appropriate as the immediate response to on illegal act;   but it wouldnot necessarily be appropriate as a sanction for a treaty, where allegedbreaches of the treaty some years hence (if referred to the Privy Council)would be a justiciable issue, &quot;which could involve a lengthy process of argument.MR. LARDNER-BURKB replied that, nevertheless, what would be in question would be a legod issue (on which, therefore, the Privy Council could appropriately adjudicate), just as it would be if the Rhodesian Governmentnode a unilateral declaration of independence.THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed that the proposal for a treaty might deservefurther consideration since it had not previously boon put forward in thediscussions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the only former British territory wherethe United Kingdom Government had entered into a treaty of guarantee as partof the process of granting independence was Cyprus;    and the precedent wasnot entirely a happy one.   Nevertheless, the idea might merit further discussion.MR. SMITH said that, oven so, the treaty would represent a possibleneons of meeting the difficulties in relation to only one of the UnitedKingdom Government&apos;3 five principles.   The difficulties in relation to theother four principles would remain.THE PRIME MINISTER accepted this but said that further examination ofthe proposal for a treaty night enable progress to bo made on at least oneof the five points.   He enquired whether there were any other issues onwhich there might be misunderstanding.MR. SMITH replied that he did not think so.MR. LARDNER-BURKE said that there was one point relating to the proposalfor a Senate which might call for elaboration.   He understood that theUnited Kingdom Government hod felt that there was objection to the proposal

-5-&apos;I 1 3put forward by the Bhodesian Government for the African representation onthe Senate to be selected from the Chiefs, on the score that these Chiefswere not elected.   It night be possible to neet this difficulty by arrangingthat a panel of candidates for six of the twelve seats night be nominated bythe Chiefs while a panel of candidates for the regaining six seats night he put forward by the electoral college for the ConstitutionalCouncil.     The actual elections night then be made by the electorate on the&apos;B&apos; Roll or, perhaps, by the conbined electorate on the &apos;A&apos; and &apos;Bf Rolls.This procedure would ensure - and this was what nattered - that candidates for the Senate would bo responsible individuals,THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether Mr. Lardner-Burke contemplated thisproposal, as representing a. blocking safeguard but one which would dependultimately on the &apos; B&apos; Roll electorate rather than on nomination by the Chiefs,The United Kingdom G-overnnent were more concerned with questions of substancethan of form and would be prepared to examine this proposal.MR. LARDNER-BURKE observed that, even if further discussion led to agreement on this question, it would not remove the difficulties in relationto the other principles.     MR. SMITH added that the proposal v/as a. safeguardfor the entrenched clauses of the Constitution;   it would not overcone thedifficulty about the blocking mechanism in relation to normal constitutional changes.   This latter point represented a serious stumbling block and onewhich the United Kingdom G-overnment had only introduced at a late stage ofthe discussions.THE COMOITWEALTK SECRETARY said that, in his earlier discussions withMr. Snith in the previous February, he had raised the question of a blockingthird for normal constitutional changes and had understood that Mr, Snithhad accepted the principle involved but had suggested that it should besatisfied by a blocking quarter.     MR. LARDNER-BURKE said that the idea ofa blocking quarter had been explored in the discussions;   but it was not a specific offer by Rhodesian Ministers since they had no mandate to present it as such.MR. SMITH added that one of the objections put forward by theCommonwealth Secretary to the proposal had been that the additional seatsshould be filled by Chiefs but he understood that this proposal was less acceptable to the United Kingdom Government than the idea of a Senate.THE PRD.CS MINISTER said that in his discussions with leaders of theOpposition he had mentioned the proposal that a White Paper might be published,which would include all the relevant recent correspondence between theUnited Kingdom and Rhodesian Ministers.   Sir Alec Douglas-Home had accepted

/&amp; 4 r*this proposal so far as his Administration was concerned:   but the PrimeMinister had not yet spoken to Mr. Macmillan whoso concurrence would haveto be obtained in respect of correspondence exchanged during his adminis-tration.   In considering this question of publication it appeared that the correspondence by itself would not be meaningful unless it was linked by a brief historical narrative summarising developments between successivestages in the correspondence.   He proposed, therefore, that the White paper should inolude a record of this kind, on the understanding that it wouldgive no indication of the content of the exchanges which might have takenpla.ce between one letter and the next but would merely refer to theirhaving taken place.MR. SMITH agreed that this would be acceptable,    He enquired whetherthe Prime Minister contemplated that the minutes of the current discussionsmight be published.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that in certain circumstances (e.g. if therewere a unilateral declaration of independence) the United Kingdom G-overnmentwould feel free to publish them.MR. SMITH said that he had been disturbed that morning to see a statement in the Press of what the Foreign Secretary had said in New York when he hadbeen asked why Rhodesia wanted independence.   Mr. Stewart was reported as having answered that this was because the Rhodesian Government wished toperpetuate white domination.   This was an unfortunate and provocativestatement.   On the contrary, the Rliodesian Government accepted the- principleof tho 1961 Constitution which ensured an ultimate African majority;    andthey were willing to agree to safeguards for its continuation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, before commenting, he would wish to seethe precise text of -what the Foreign Secretary had said, since a misquota.tionor a much abbreviated version of what had been said frequently led tomisunderstanding.   He accepted that the differences between the UnitedKingdom and Rhodesian Governments related not to the question whether thereshould be perpetual minority rule but to the question how quickly minorityrule might come to an end.   But, if Mr. Smith contemplated - as he had said in public - that minority rule should last for at least as long as his ownlifetime, this would amount to a difference of principle rather then of timing and might justify what the Foreign Secretary had said.

MR. SMITH said that he could not accept this viev/ and hoped that thePrirae Minister would excjaine the text of what the Foreign Secretary had said.He agreed, however, that misunderstanding could arise as a result of incorrectquotation by the Press.   Indeed, the Rhodesian Government had themselvessuffered in this respect in that there had been a Press statement thatMr. Harper, on his return through Johannesburg to Southern Rhodesia, had said that a unilateral declaration of independence was inevitable.   In fact,what he had said was that such a declaration was not inevitable,THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that at least the United Kingdom Press hadnot given an incorrect impression of what had been said by both sides duringthe recent discussions.MR&apos;. SMITH agreed that the position was quite clear and that one thingwhich had emerged from the discussions was that both sides now knew wherethey stood.London, S.W.I.,October, 1965.-7-
