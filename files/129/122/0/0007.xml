REFORMS RELATING TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN TROUBLEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Horns department i attach the draft of a White Paper setting cut proposals for improving our methods of forestalling delinquency and dealing with young offenders.    An earlier draft was discussed by the Home Affairs Committee,and, so far as it related to the question of a family service, by the social services Committee.    The circulated paper takes account of the views expressed by those Committees.    The main proposals are summarised atthe end of the paper.2.       The proposals are based on a review carried out urgently at theHome Office and we have not consulted outside organisations.    We havenaturally taken full account of the proposals of Lord Longford1?, committee as set out in &quot;Crime - a challenge to us ail&quot; and of the Kilbrandon Reportrelating to young offenders in Scotland.    We also know, from evidencecollected over the last few years by official and unofficial bodies, thegeneral attitude of most interested organisations about reforms in this field.These organisations will have views to express, but we have thought it bestat this juncture to make our own assessment of what would be a desirable and practicable scheme of reforms, and to publish our conclusions as abasis of public discussion and for consultation with interested organisations.Many of our proposals are likely to prove controversial, and have been deliberately cast in a tentative form, thus leaving the way open for further discussion.3.      I seek the approval of the Cabinet for the publication of a white paper in the terms cf the draft.    I propose to show it in confidence to theLord Chief Justice and the Royal Commission on the Penal System inadvance of publication.4.      Following discussion on the Home Affairs Committee we have emphasised (in paragraph 1) the Government&apos;s intention to consultinterested organisations and to seek their co-operation.    The Committeealso thought that since it may be some weeks before the White Paper is published, there would be merit in informing these organisations of whatwas proposed in advance of publication.    If the Cabinet agree, I will inform the Local Authority Associations, and the Association of ApprovedSchool Managers, and the other organisations most closely affected, of the impending publication, and send them, in strict confidence, a summary ofthe proposals.    I arn bound to point out that there is a risk of leakage here,and that the summary would contain practically all the immediate newsvalue of the White Paper.-1--HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 107 COPY NO.__20th July, 1965CABINET

5.      Paragraph 7 of the paper was prepared in the light of thediscussions of the Social Services Committee about the wider issue   ofthe social sex&quot;vices concerned with the family, and announces theGovernment^ intention to consider this matter.    In view of the specialconsultations in which he has been engaged, the Chancellor of the Duchymay wish to inform the Local Authority Associations specially about thisbefore the more general communication envisaged in the preceding paragraph.Home Office, 3.77.1.20th July, 1965-2-

YOUNG PEOPLE IN TROUBLEProposals for Reform of the Law and PracticeI.    introduction.     In The Queen&apos;s Speech on the opening of the present parliament it was said&quot;My Government will &quot;be actively concerned to make more effective the means of sustainingthe family and of preventing and treatingdelinquency&quot;.This paper sets out the Government&apos;s provisionalproposals for practical reforms   to support the familyto forestall and reduce delinquency, and to revise the law and practice relating to offenders up to 21 .They are published for the purposes of discussion&quot;before legislation is prepared.     The Government intend to consult organisations interested in these matters,and to seek the advice in particular of those who willhave to operate any new system.2.     The increase in crime in recent years has given rise to growing public concern.     The prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders have been thesubject of numerous reports and proposals by official and unofficial bodies.     These include Lord Ingleby&apos;sCommittee on Children and Young Persons;   the HorisonCommittee on the Probation Service;   the RoyalCommission on the Police;   and several importantreports by the Home Secretary&apos;s Advisory Council onthe Treatment of Offenders.     A further valuable contribution, relating to the situation in Scotland,was made by Lord Kilbrandon&apos;s Committee on children and Young Persons.

3.     Before the present Government took office, a group under the Chairmanship of Lord Longford, consistingof people with special knowledge and experience inthe field of penal and social policy, made a study ofthe problems involved;   and their Report &quot;Crime, a challenge to us all&quot;, which was published in 196h,has served to stimulate informed discussion,k.     A recurrent theme has &quot;been the urgent need to concentrate resources on the prevention and treatmentof juvenile delinquency.     A high proportion of adultcriminals have been juvenile delinquents, so that everyadvance in dealing with the young offender helps alsoin the attack on adult crime.     The prospect of success,and its rewards, are greatest with young offenders.It is right that radical reforms of the penal system as a whole should await completion of the review whichthe Royal Commission on the Penal System was appointed in 196U to undertake:   hut desirable reforms affectingthose under 21 should wait no longer.     The RoyalCommission are of course being kept fully informed ofthe Governments plans.5.     The causes of delinquency are complex, and too little is known about them with certainty.      It is atleast clear that much delinquency - and indeed many other social problems - can be traced back to inadequacyor breakdown in the family.     The right place to begin,therefore, is with the family.II.    FAMILY SUPPORT6.     Then local authorities were given new powers underthe Children Act, 19*4-8, to care for children who hadbeen deprived of a natural home life, it became necessaryfor them also to undertake work with families so thatthe children might return home wherever possible.

Services in support of the family were also provided -under the National Health Service Act 19u7 andthe National Assistance Act 1 9^-8 by local authoritiesthrough their health or welfare departments.     this work was developed over the years, and, following therecommendation of Lord Ingleby&apos;s Committee, localauthorities were required under Section 1 of the children and Young Persons Act, 1963s to &quot;make available such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need to receive them into or keep them in care, or for them to bebrought before a juvenile court11.     Local authoritiesare making vigorous use of these new preventive powers as well as developing the services of their health and welfare departments;    children&apos;s departments arebeing expanded and more social workers are being trained;a number- of authorities have set up a central index of families at risk to assist any department of theauthority or other organisation to help a family thatappears to be in danger of social breakdown;    and familyadvice centres are being established as focal pointswhere the social services can be readily available tothose who need them.     This preventive work with familiesis of cardinal importance both for its positive socialvalue and as a means of exposing situations which might give rise to delinquency.     Lord Longford&apos;s committee recommended that it should be enlarged and devolped in a new Family Service that would include all thefunctions of the existing children&apos;s department, andcertain functions of the health, education and welfaredepartments concerned with family problems.3,

7.     The proposals made in this paper for the reform ofthe law and practice relating to young offenders emphasise the need to improve the structure of the various servicesconnected with support of the family and the prevention ofdelinquency.     The Government believe that those services should be organised as a family service, but tho form and scope of such a service will need detailed consideration,Tho Government therefore propose to appoint a smellindependent committee to review the organisation and responsibilities of the local authority social services,and consider what changes are desirable to ensure an effective family service.     References in this paper to children&apos;s Departments and the Children&apos;s service refer tothe existing organisation and are without prejudice towhat the Committee may recommend.

III.      YOUNG OFFENDERS AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS&quot; &quot;IN NEED OF CARE.  PROTECTION.  OR CONTROL8.     However successful local authorities and voluntary bodiesmay be in their work of sustaining the family, it is clearthat there are considerable numbers of young people for whom,because of their conduct or background, special arrangements will have to be made.     At present, young persons under 21years of age fall broadly into two categories.     The firstincludes children and young persons under the age of 17 who, ifthey are thought to be in need of care, protection or control or(being over the age of 10) are alleged to heve committed an offence, may be brought before a juvenile court.      The secondconsists of those between the ages of 17 and 21 who, if they areaccused of having committed an offence, are dealt with by theordinary courts, but far whsm certain special sanctions areavailable.9.      The Government have come to the conclusion that in futurechildren and young persons under the age of 21  should be regardedas falling into two categories;    those under the age of 16, andthose between the ages of 16 and 21.     Sixteen will soon be theupper age for compulsory school attendance.      It marks a significant stage in the lives ef many young people.      It is theage at which they begin to earn, at which many may leave home,at which they may marry.     The same considerations lead to theconclusion that this should also be the upper age for the specialpreventive measures which are applied by law to those children who are in need of care, protection &amp;r control and the age after which young persons should in general become subject to the sanctionsof the ordinary criminal law. .      This paper accordingly dealsfirst with those children and young persons under 16 years ofage, next with the family court and young offenders court, andthen with the treatment of those between the ages of 16 and 21 .5

10 4.A. Children and Young Persons under 1610.    There has been an increasing weight of informed opinionover the last ten years in favour of changes in our methods ofdealing with children and young persons under 16 who now come before the juvenile courts.     These courts were created in 1908.They have their own simplified procedures and they are served by selected magistrates.     But though care is taken to avoid the characteristics of a criminal court, their procedures naturallyderive from the criminal courts.     We believe that these arrange-ments should be radically changed, because:-(1)   Children should be spared the stigma of criminality.(2)    In the great majority of cases of offenders brought before the juvenile courts, the facts are not in dispute.     The problem is to decide the appropriatetreatment, and the court procedures, designedessentially for testing evidence, do not provide thebest means for directing social inquiries and discuss-ing possibilities with the child&apos;s parents and thesocial services that might be concerned with treatment.(3)   Although when children appear in the juvenile courtstheir parents attend whenever possible, the present arrangements do not provide the best means of gettingparents to assume more personal responsibility fortheir children&apos;s behaviour,(h)   Decisions as to treatment are made in the form of acourt order.     This does not allow sufficientflexibility in developing the child&apos;s treatmentaccording to his response and changing need.11 .    We therefore propose to remove young people so far aspossible from the jurisdiction of the court^, and to empowereach local authority, through its children&apos;s committee, toappoint local family councils to deal with each case as far as6

CONFIDENTIALpossible in consultation and agreement with, the parents.     Wherethe facts were disputed or agreement could not fre-reached, thecase would have to be referred to the family court, to V/nich 105reference is made later.     This of course must be done in sucha way as to ensure that, as at present, the full safeguards ofthe law are available to ensure that the interests of the child or young person are protected.Family Councils12.    It is proposed that there should be appointed by the localauthority of each county and county borough, and of each greater london borough, acting through its children&apos;s committee, a numberof family councils consisting of social workers of the children&apos;service and other persons selected for their understanding and experience of children and, in particular, for their awarenessof the problems facing the children and adults likely to come before them.      Each council, when sitting, would include atleast one man and woman.     There would be sufficient councils toenable discussions with parents to be conducted in an unhurriedmanner;   and as far as is practicable their meeting placeswould be so arranged that parents and their children would nothave too far to travel.     They would in no case meet in a courtbuilding.      Social inquiries required by the councils would beundertaken by the children&apos;s service for the area.Procedure ofm the Family Councils13.    Where it was thought, by any person who can now bring a child or young person before a juvenile court, that a child oryoung person under 16 had committed what would in an olderperson be an offence, or was in need of care, protection or control, or had failed to attend school, he would report thecircumstances to the family council.     Social inquiries wouldbe carried out where necessary and the council would see the child and his parents in those cases which required it.     Inmost cases, there would be no disagreement as to the factsalleged.     Where, however the facts were disputed by the child

cotiayalor his parents, the case would be referred to the family courtin order that the facts might be judicially determined.1h.   Before discussing with the parents what action, if any,ought to be taken, the family council would consider all theinformation available about the child and his background.In some cases it would be clear that the parents could themselvesdeal adequately with the situation.     In others, it might beagreed that the matter should be disposed of by the parentspaying compensation to anyone who had suffered loss from the child&apos;s delinquency.     In yet other cases, agreement might bereached on the desirability of placing the child under the supervision of an officer of the children&apos;s service, or of sending him for some form of residential training.     Any agreementthus reached would be formally recorded.     It could be variedfrom time to time in agreement with the parents;   and the case would in any event be reviewed frwm year to year.     If theagreement was not complied with, it would be open to the familycouncil to refer the case to the family court, who would dealwith it as if it had come before them for decision in the firstinstance,15.    Cases would be referred to the family court if agreementwith the parents proved to be impossible, or if for any other reason the council thought such a reference was desirable.It would be open to the family court to make any order which isnow appropriate to a juvenile court, except that, where long-term residential training was considered to be appropriate,the child or young person would be committed to the care of thelocal authority.Facilities for Observationand^Assessnent16.    It is important that there should be available to allfamily councils observation centres suitably equipped andstaffed to assess any child referred to them.     These would be8CONr I DcNTI Ahi

(TOKIEinEKlTIAI\dy   riyciprovided by local authorities and would replace remand homes.They would provide facilities for the examination of childrenstill living at home as well as facilities for residentialobservation.     Although the family council would not be a courtof law, it would seem right that it should have power, even ina case in which the parents disagree, to refer a child to anobservation centre for a limited period for assessment and fora report on the type of treatment that is likely to provebeneficial in his case.      The observation centre would also ifit were decided that the child or young person requiredresidential training, advise the local authority on the selection of the residential establishment best able to meet his needs.The centre would thus, in effect, take over the functions whichare now performed not only by remand homes but by classifyingapproved schools.17.   Under the present law, children aged 1h and 15 may be sentto a remand centre on the ground that they are too unruly ordepraved for accommodation in a remand home.,     It may be necessaryto provide that if such cases occur under the new procedure the family court should be empowered, on application, to make asimilar order.Methods of Treatment(a)    Monetary Penalties18.   At present a juvenile court may impose a fine upon a child or young person coming before it;    and about l+O per cent ofcases are disposed of in this way.      It would not seem appropriate to empower the family council to agree with the parent that acase should be dealt with by the voluntary payment of a fine.But it would clearly be right that an agreement V/ith the parentshould include the payment of compensation to a person who has suffered loss as a result of the child&apos;s conduct.      It would, ofcourse, remain open to the family court,  in the case of any child9

coning before it, to impose such monetary penalty as it thought fit.(b) At^endjince Centres19.    It should be open to the council to agree with the parent,or for the family court to order, that a child or young person should attend at an Attendance Centre for a given number of hours.(c) Supervision20.    It should be the purpose of the family council to agr^ewith the parent upon the method of treatment most likely to benefit the child or young person concerned.     As already indicated, there will be cases in which it will he best toleave the responsibility for the child&apos;s training and welfarewith the parents.      In some of these cases it may be desirableto support the efforts of the parents by requiring an officerof the children&apos;s service to exercise supervision over the child for a specified period - perhaps of one, two, orthree years - subject to an age limit of 18.     The familycouncil would be obliged to review the case each year or more often if it thought it desirable - with a view to terminating the agreement or order if supervision is no longur necessary.10

11(d) Shcrt-term training21.    In other cases, short-term training of the kind nowprovided in junior detention centres may he thought appropriate.It would hardly he practicable for local authorities to providesuch centres, and it is proposed that for the time being, atleast, they should continue to be provided and administered bythe Home Office.(e) Longer-term training22.   Where longer-term residential training is thought to bedesirable, it is proposed that the child should be placed inthe care of the local authority.     It would then be for thechildren&apos;s committee, with the agreement of the family counciland the parents, to arrange for the child to be cared for ina special residential school or children&apos;s home, or to beboarded out in a foster-home.     In each case the choice would depend upon the needs of the individual child.     The intentionwould be to encourage local autherities and voluntary bodjesto develop a wide range of residential establishments so thata child could, after assessment, be sent to one from whoseregime he is likely to derive the greatest benefit.The family council would be obliged to review the caseeach year or more often if it thought desirable;    the aimwould be to restore the child to his parents as soon aspracticable consistently with his best interests.23.   Approved schools at present catering for children and young persons in this age group would no longer form part ofa separate service, but would fit into the comprehensive range of residential establishments.     Save in special cases approvedby the Secretary of State, they would be takon over by localauthorities.     Arrangements would, however, be made for retaining the voluntary help at present devoted to their

management and in particular for preserving the specialcharacter of schools provided by religious bodies and other national foundations.     Where a local authority made arrangements with a voluntary body providing residentialtraining for the care of a child or young person, it wouldmake a payment sufficient to cover the cost;    this would replace the present arrangements for meeting the cost jf voluntaryapproved schools.Abolition of right of trial by Jury2k.-   At present a young person aged 1h. or over may claim trialby jury for an indictable offence which is not a summaryoffence, or for a summary offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for more than three months.   Amagistrates&apos; court must, before proceeding to try such a casesummarily, inform the accused ef this right.     The right totrial by jury for children under 1k was abolished (except forhomicide) by the Children and Young Persons Act, 1932,following a recommendation by the Departmental Committee onthe Treatment of Young Offenders, 1927.     Under the arrangementsoutlined in this paper it would seem unnecessary and indeedinappropriate to retain any power for a person between the ages of 1lx and 16 to insist upon a jury when his case is referred to a family court for determination of the facts.Homicide25.   Homicide by children is extremely rare and almost alwaysinvolves mental abnormality or extreme provocation.Nevertheless, the offence is of such a special kind that itseems right that homicide cases should continue to be dealtwith at assizes, on committal from the family court.12

Enlargement of local authorities1  children&apos;s services26.    The changes proposed will place heavy additionalresponsibilities on the children&apos;s departments of localauthorities.     Mere social workers will be needed, inparticular to serve the family councils, and ta undertake work, corresponding to that at present done by the probationand after care service, with children under 16 who have been before the court.     It is to be expected that the proposedcouncils will require more numerous and fuller social inquiriesthan many courts do now, and that more time may be spent in discussion with parents;    this may add to the number of social workers required.     In all, children&apos;s departments may needsomething like 1,000 additional social workers (some of whommight transfer from the probation and after care service).Children&apos;s departments are already being expanded to meet the challenge of Section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act,1963, and local authorities have forecast an increase of some900 child care posts during the period 31st March, 196h -31st March, 1968, mainly for social work with families at risk.27.    The training and recruitment of social workers   onthe scale required will take some time, and it will thereforebe necessary for the proposals in this paper to be broughtinto full operation by stages.      This can probably best bedone by enabling the proposed family councils to deal withyounger children only at first, gradually raising the age to16.B.    Courts for dealing with young personsFamily Courts28.    It is proposed that special magistrates&apos;  courts should be constituted from panels of justices selected for their capacity to deal with young persons.     Ordinarily a panel would beestablished for each petty sessions area, but there would be

power to combine two or more areas under a panel where thiswas desirable to enable the work to be more efficientlyorganized.    The special magistrates&apos; court would have two distinct jurisdictions.    In dealing with matters involvingthose under the age or sixteen, it would sit as a familycourt.    In order that advantage may be taken of the experienceof the justices sitting in the family court, it is proposedthat the family court should also exercise the presentjurisdiction of magistrates&apos; courts in adoption matters and in determining applications by persons under twenty-one for consent to marry without parental permission, and, possibly, thejurisdiction to make an affiliation order where the respondentis under twenty-one.   When the family courts have becomeestablished,  it is envisaged that consideration should be givento enlarging the jurisdiction to include other matters affecting the family.Young Offenders&apos; Courts29o   At present offenders under 17 aru dealt with in juvenilecourts, and offenders between the ages of 17 and 21 are dealtwith in the ordinary courts.    The special courts, sitting asyoung offenders&apos;  courts, would exercise criminal jurisdiction over offences alleged to have been committed by persons betweenthe ages of sixteen and twenty-one.    A youth charged with an offence which in the case of an adult is not triable summarilyand is either triable at assizes only or punishable withfourteen yeais imprisonment or more (e.g. murder, rape orrobbery) would be committed by the young offenders&apos; court for trial to the appropriate superior court.    In all other cases a young offenders&apos; court would deal with the matter unless itthought the offence so serious that it ought to be tried atassizes, or unless the accused claimed trial by jury.   The young offenders&apos; court would be presided over by a legally qualified

chairman when dealing with indictable offences not triablesummarily in the case of an adult (hut within the jurisdiction of the young offenders&apos; court) and with cases of grievous bodilyharm or actual bodily harm and breaking offences.    The hearingwould be in public, and there would be no restrictions on thepublication of the name of any person.Hearings and Appeals30.    The young offenders&apos; court would sit at separate times from &quot;boththe adult courts and the family courts to avoid contact betweenadults accused of crime and the persons of differing ages withwhich the special courts would have to deal.   Appeals from a young offenders&apos; court would be heard by a court of quarter sessions specially constituted if the young offenders&apos; courtwas not presided over by a legally qualified chairman;    and bythe Court of Criminal Appeal if it was.   Appeals from familycourts when dealing with cases which had been before the familycouncil would be to the specially constituted court of quarter sessions;    appeals from family courts exercising other juris-diction would follow the same course as appeal from ordinarymagistrates&apos;  courts exercising a similar jurisdiction.

Quarter Sessions and Assizes31.    It is proposed that when quarter sessions orassizes deal with persons under 21, the case should,as far as practicable, be taken at a different time from adult cases, and that justices on the specialpanel (s^e paragraph 28) should sit as members of thecourt.     At assizes, crown courts, and borough quarter sessions, they would sit with the judge or recorder,and share responsibility for determining sentence, andin the case of an appeal for determining guilt or the disputed facts.     Two justices would ordinarily besufficient for the purpose.     At county quarter sessions,the justices present in these cases would be membersof the special panel.G.    Treatment of Offenders- between the ages of&quot; 1 6 and 21Powers of Young Offenders&apos; Courts(a) non-custcclial sentences32.    It is proposed that young offenders&apos; courts shouldhave the same powers as are nov/ available to courtsdealing with the 17 to 21 age group to impose non-custodial sentences - absolute and conditional discharge,binding-over, probation, fine and attendance at anattendance centre if one is available.(b) Custodial sentences33.    It is proposed that a young offenders1 court shouldhave power to impose a sentence of detention not exceeding-six months or, if it is presided over by a legallyqualified chairman, three years.     It would be opento a young offenders&apos; court without a legally qualifiedchairman to refer a case for sentence to a court withsuch a chairman.     Similarly a young offenders&apos; courtpresided over by a legally qualified chairman would beempowered to commit to assizes for sentence.16

Principle of sentencing3b,   All courts, when passing sentence on an offenderunder 21, would he required, as juvenile courts now are,to have regard to his welfare.Kenand and Observation Centres35c   The facilities now available, or being provided,in remand centres would be fully available to theyoung offenders&apos; courts.     These centres would provide an assessment of the needs of the offender and of theform of treatment most likely to be beneficial to him.Forms of custodial training36.   At present, a person aged 16 nay not be sentenced to imprisonment;   and for the 17 to 21&apos;s the right toimpose a sentence of imprisonment has been greatlyrestricted.     Those who are sent to prison are keptseparate from adult prisoners in young prisoners&apos;centres.     Most of those between the ages of 16 and 21ordered to undergo custodial training are sent todetention centres, approved schools or borstal.37.    It is proposed that in future there should be threetypes of custodial sentences for the 16 to 21 age group.The first would be short-term detention of three or six months, in what is now known as a detention centre.The second would be training for a minimum period of nine months and a maximum period of two years - theactual time to be determined by reference to the youngperson&apos;s progress - in a youth training centre.     Thethird would be long-tern training - in such cases asthe courts now deal with by imposing a sentence of imprisonment - for such period as is now competent.Detention centre training38.   No change is&quot;proposed at present in the organisation&apos; and methods of the detention centres.     The court would

order training for a period of either three or six months.The hoy would he eligible for discharge on licenceafter completing five-sixths of his sentence.Youth training centres39.    It is proposed to merge and reorganise the presentborstals and senior approved schools into a comprehensive system of residential training catering for the wide variety of types coming before the courts.     The HomeOffice would take over responsibility for the seniorapproved schools and for the organisation of the comprehensive range of training establishments.      It isproposed that the minimum period of training should benine months and the maximum two years.     experience with borstal training has shown that the present minimum period of six months is too short to enable good results to be achieved.     The actual date of discharge onlicence would depend on the response to training of theyoung person concerned.Young offenders institutionshO.   For offenders sentenced by the courts to training for a period longer than two years, separate establishmentswould be provided by the Home Office.     So far as thenumbers make it possible, they would offer a variety ofregimes catering for the varied needs of different types of offenders,After-CareU1.   It is proposed that in the case of offenders in thisage group who are sentenced to short-term training, thereshould be a period of statutory after-care lasting for ayear.     In the case of offenders sentenced to training fora longer period, the statutory after-care would continue for two years.     During this period an offender would be liable to recall if he were found to be conducting lUmssXtin a way which made this course desirable in his interests.

The probation and after-care service is already beingexpanded as rapidly as possible to enable it to meet its growing responsibilities.k3.   These proposed changes have two main purposes.     Thefirst is to take children and young persons under the ageof 16 as far as possible outside the ambit of the criminal law and of the courts, and to make, if possible with theagreement of their parents or guardians, such arrangementsfor their welfare as are appropriate.     The second is todivorce the arrangements for the trial and treatment of young persons in the 16 to 21  age group as far aspossible from the ordinary criminal courts and from the penal system as it applies to adults.213.   In both cases the determining factor in deciding what is to be done must be the welfare of the particularchild or young person.     The object of whatever training-is agreed upon, or ordered by the court, must be to make him into a law-abiding and useful citizen.     There is no intention to deal lightly with young offenders - quitethe contrary.     What is needed is firm discipline and constructive treatment directed to the welfare orrehabilitation of the individual child or young person.The provision of such discipline and treatment, on thelines indicated in this White Paper, will require asubstantial and sustained effort on the part of bothcentral and local government.     It is the governments intention that such an effort should be made with theutmost urgency,hh. This is a field in which at present a greatcontribution is being made by voluntary effort - in theadministration of approved schools and children&apos;s homes;in the organisation of services designed to support the family; in the work of welfare and after-care. It isthe Governments wish that this voluntary effort shouldbe maintained and strengthened.     The proposals made inIV.GENERAL

this paper for the merging of the present approvedschool service, partly in a comprehensive system of residential training for those betv/een the ages of 16 and21 , partly in a comprehensive system of residentialtraining for those under 16, must not he allowed to resultin the loss of the invaluable voluntary effort now givento the administration of the schools.     The Home office will welcome the continuing interest and support of voluntary workers in its own training establishments;and there is no reason to doubt that the local authorities will be equally glad to enlist voluntary help.k5.   The central responsibility for promoting these new developments for dealing with young people in troublewill rest with the Home Office, local responsibility withthe local authorities and their children&apos;s departments.Administrative reorganisation and strengthening will berequired at both levels.

Special arrangements would also bemade within the Hone Office for the development and running of a comprehensive range of training establishmentsdistinct from the prison system, for those between the ages of 16 and 21.     It is essential that the necessary centraladministrative impetus should be given to the new developments outlined in this paper;    and departmentalarrangements within the Home Office would in general beso adjusted as to ensure this.20
