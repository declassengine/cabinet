THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government. (65) 114 Copy No.   5927 th July, 1965CABINETTHE FIFTY-YEAR RULEMemorandum by the Prime minister the Public Records Act. 1958, established the statutory principlethat departmental records should not be available to the general public until a date 50 years after their creation. This principle hasalready been the subject of criticism by modern historians on thegrounds that the period of 50 years is unnecessarily long and thatthe rule is inimical both to the public interest and to the requirementsof genuine scholarship. The question has recently been examined bythe Advisory Council on Public Records, under the chairmanship ofthe Master of the Rolls; and the Council have recommended to theLord Chancellor:(i) that the &quot; closed &quot; period should be reduced to 40 years; and(ii) that even within that reduced period more liberal accessshould be allowed to established historians.The Scottish Records Advisory Council have made recommendationsalong similar lines.2. In discussion with the Lord Chancellor I have formed certainpreliminary views on these proposals; and I should welcome theopinion of my colleagues on the course which we should now pursue.
3. The justification for the present period of 50 years (which was accepted on the recommendation of the Grigg Committee onDepartmental Records) is that it not only prevents the premature disclosure of confidential information which might be prejudicial tothe State but also, and chiefly, preserves the constitutional principleof the collective responsibility of the Cabinet and the individualresponsibility of Ministers to Parliament. For these reasons it isnecessary to preserve the confidential nature of a Ministers relation-ship with his Ministerial colleagues on the one hand and with hissenior advisers on the other hand. Moreover, it is desirable, in theinterests of history as well as of current administration, to safeguard the quality of &quot; unselfconsciousness&quot; in official records in the sense that, if advice is to be tendered frankly and discussed freely, neitherMinisters nor their senior advisers should be subjected to the possibleembarrassment of having their deliberations published while they arestill active in public affairs.4. On the other hand, 50 years is admittedly an arbitraryfigure; and, after weighing the considerations mentioned aboveagainst the desirability of allowing informed public opinion to enjoyfreer access to the raw material of history, I have no doubt in my own mind that a closed period of 40 years (or less) could be adoptedwithout any harm to the basic principles of the rule.5. But the Council&apos;s recommendation that within the closedperiod more liberal access should be allowed for establishedhistorians is more debatable. I recognise that there are goodarguments in favour of this proposal. Thus:(a) Almost the whole of the advance of our Colonies, and muchof that of India, towards independence has taken place within the last 40 years. If we do not write the historyof this process, the newly independent Governments ofthose countries will; and, unless we permit access to ourrecords, our side of the story will be liable to go bydefault.
(6) The same is true of large areas of international affairs, sincecertain other countries, particularly the United States,are considerably more generous in allowing access totheir documents than we are to ours.(c) The study of recent history is now a recognised branch ofscholarship; and, while this does not in itself give scholarsworking in this field a right of access to material which,in the interests of proper administration, ought to remainconfidential, an objective and dispassionate analysis ofthe recent past can, on occasion, promote a moreinformed public understanding of contemporary issues and contribute to the greater efficiency of current policy-making and administration.6. On the other hand, I suspect and this is also the consensusof view of Departments which have given much study to the matter that the recommendation would be extremely difficult to implementin such a way as not to undermine the basic principles of a closedperiod. We should be faced with a number of awkward problems.For example:(a) There would be the question whether access to cabinet papers should be allowed within the closed period. It hasalways been a strictly enforced principle that access tothe papers of the Cabinet and its Committees within thatperiod is not granted to any &quot; outside &quot; individual; and,in so far as we conceded the more generous degree ofpublic access which the Advisory Council have proposed,we should be departing from all previous practice.(b) It would not be easy to devise a procedure for selecting&quot;established&quot; historians which would not causeresentment and perhaps, in the long run, undo the goodwill generated by a decision in principle to allowfreer access.
(c) Nor would it be easy to devise a procedure for decidingwhich episodes of recent peace-time history should betreated by the established historians. If the purpose ofmore liberal access were not to be frustrated, thedecisions would have to be free from political controversy and run no risk of undermining the established convention that one Administration does not enjoy access to the records of its predecessors. In thisconnection we have to remember that the periods orepisodes which command the greatest interest amonghistorians are, naturally, those which are the mostpolitically controversial. This is not the case in relationto the two Great Wars of this century, since for the major part of the time in each case Coalition governments have been in office and there has been a truce in partyconflict. It is largely this truce which has made it possible for us to write, and to publish, the OfficialHistories of both Wars; and it is the necessary absenceof any such truce in peace-time which makes the writing of peace-time histories more arguable, particularly onany basis which involves discrimination between onehistorian, or one historical period, and another.7. For these reasons, it might be wise to find other means of satisfying the deske which prompted the Advisory Councils secondrecommendation; and I believe that our best course would be toreduce the closed period to 30 years, rather than 40, while retaining the existing safeguards against premature disclosure, as follows:(a) The Public Records Act, 1958 (s. 5(4)) already allowscontrolled access to records which are still within theclosed period of 50 years; but it clearly envisages suchaccess as being exceptional and the provision has been so interpreted by Departments in practice. This provision and this interpretation of it should remain unaltered inrelation to a closed period of 30 years.
(b) There should be no change in the arrangements whereby the Lord Chancellor has (under s. 5(1) of the PublicRecords Act) already prescribed closure for specifiedclasses of records for longer periods up to 100 years.Generally these classes are those which containinformation about individuals which could causeembarrassment or distress to living persons or their immediate descendants; or contain information whosedisclosure might constitute a breach of confidence; orinvolve special security considerations.Provided that we maintain these provisions in relation to a closedperiod of 30 years, I do not believe that a reduction of the period tothat figure would undermine the essential principles of public administration which the present rule was designed to preserve; and,in terms of allowing unrestricted access (subject to the exceptionsnoted above) to the official documentation of a period of historywhich is presently closed, it would offer to historians a substantially greater concession than the Advisory Council have recommended.8. A reduction in the closed period would involve a Bill toamend the 1958 Act (although the change could be made in Scotlandwithout legislation). Pending the Bill, there is one anticipatory step which we might take, by Order, as an earnest of our intentions namely to derestrict in a single operation the official records of the1914-18 war, instead of releasing them only one year at a time bythe existing process of &quot; creeping decontrol &quot;. In practice, this would imply the release of all records, both Cabinet and Departmental,relating to the period of the war (other than those which will still have to be withheld indefinitely, for reasons of public policy); andit would be convenient if &quot; the period of the war &quot; were interpreted as including the immediate aftermath of the war itself, i.e., up tothe end of 1922, the year in which the Coalition Government fell.I believe a gesture of this kind would gain us considerable creditwith the professional historians and with public opinion.
9. Apart from the question of a reduction in the closed period,I should like my colleagues to consider two supplementary, butseparate, measures which we might take in the same field:(i) On occasion the Government might think that it was in thepublic interest that a history of relatively recent eventsshould be undertaken while the written records could still be supplemented by reference to the personalrecollections of public men who took part in the events in question. For this purpose, we might extend the range of Official Histories (which have so far been confined to the two world wars) to include selectedperiods or episodes of peace-time history, on theunderstanding that the publication of works of this kind would need to be suspended for a time which would normally be at least equivalent to the 30-year period. Inorder, however, that there should be no derogation fromthe principle that one Administration does not enjoyaccess to the policy records of its predecessors, it wouldbe necessary to arrange that any decision to commissionsuch a history should be taken by the Government only with the consent of the Leaders of the other political parties or of some form of bi-partisan body, preferablyconsisting of Privy Councillors, which might beestablished for the purpose.(ii) Alternatively, or in addition, we might publish, in relationto particular episodes of peace-time history, as much aspossible of the relevant official documents, on the same lines as the Foreign Office series of documents on british foreign Policy. On the basis of that precedent, the documents chosen for publication would have to be confined to the formal records illustrating the historicaldevelopment and execution of policy, i.e., they wouldhave to exclude the internal minutes and records of discussions by means of which policy was formulated.
Even so, the reception accorded to the Foreign Officeseries suggests that, if we extended the practice to the records of other Departments concerned with our external relations, we should do no damage and should,indeed, do something to put in more accurate perspectiveour own version of, e.g., the complex progress of someof our former dependencies towards independence. Itmight also help to reduce the embarrassment in whichwe sometimes find ourselves in relation to the practiceof the United States Government, who are considerably more generous in allowing access to their documents than we are to ours and whose records include a number of documents originating in this country, to which historianscan obtain access in the United States but not here. Itwould thus, in some measure, meet the arguments set outin paragraph 5 above.10. I should be glad if members of the Cabinet and other ministers in charge of Departments would consider the above proposals carefully. If the Cabinet endorsed them, particularly theproposed change to a 30-year rule (both generally and as regardsCabinet records), the next step would be to discuss them with theOpposition Leaders and to seek The Queen&apos;s approval in relationto Cabinet records. Thereafter we could proceed to a public announcement and to the introduction of the necessary legislationwhen Parliamentary time permits.H. W.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,27th July, 1965.
