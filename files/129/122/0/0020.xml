(65) 44th Conclusions,Minute 4) the Cabinet asked me to arrange for the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Development to consider the implications of the coal price increases proposed in the Minister of Power&apos;o memorandum(C. (65) 110), particularly in relation to the Government&apos;1 s plans for regional development.Case for general increase2.      We first considered the arguments for and against meeting theCoal Board1 a deficit by increasing prices rather than by either:-(a) carrying the deficit on the Exchequer for the time being j(b) includingtH3 year&apos;s deficit (estimated by the Coal Board atsome  25 to  30 million) in the  400 million which it hasalready been agreed to write off.    The Cabinet will remember that about  25 0 million of the  400 million representedaccumulated losses and about  150 million assets which, were no longer economically viable and were to be taken out ofproduction over the next few years under the Coal Board&apos;plans for reorganising the industry (the details and timing ofwhich we have not yet been told).    This proposal v/ould mean that about  280 million of the  400 million v/ould representaccumulated losses (including this yea.r&apos;s deficit), leaving  120 million for the wasting assets.3.      Some of us thought that, having already promised the coal board considerable assistance by way of capital reorganisation partly in order to write off past debts, we should be much criticised fordeferring price increases and so allowing the Board&apos;s debt to beginmounting again.     They thought that not to allow the Board to increase prices would be bad for the morale of the industry.    They consideredthat we should recognise and fa.ce the consequences for our prices and incomes policy, which is not, as they suggest, designed to preventincreases whether of prices or incomes which cam be shown to be justifiable.    By deferring price increases now, it was suggested thatwe should only be creating further difficulties for ourselves later.-I-

4.     A majority of us, however, took the view that an increase in coal prices announced now could have the most serious effect on prices and incomes policy at a time when it is of the most pressing importance that its efficacy should be supported and demonstrated.    We accepted that, looking at the matter solely from the point of view of the coalindustry, there v/as a case for an increase, but we thought that the major social, economic and political consequences of increases in coal prices at this juncture must outweigh other considerations.    We.recognised the force of the Chancellor of the Exchequers objections to carrying the deficit on the Exchequer, but thought that the balance ofadvantage at this time lay in treating this year&apos;s deficit as part of the 400 million to the write-off of which we have already agreed, in themanner described in paragraph 2(b) above.    We were assured thatthis was a practicahle preposition.Regional differentiation5.     We then considered the method by which the price increases, ifthey were agreed, should be applied.    The consensus of view v/as that,if the price increases were approved in principle, it would be right toapply them in the manner suggested by the National Coal 3oard, whichwould be consistent with the Board&apos;s objective of concentratingproduction as far as possible on economically viable pits.    But those of us who were opposed to the idea of a price increase at this time thoughtthat our objections were strengthened by the difficulty of reconcilingwith our regional policies   increases of coal prices which would fallparticularly heavily on regions where the need for development v/asgreatest.G.
