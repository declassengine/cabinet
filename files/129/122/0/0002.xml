ilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)LAND COMMISSION; BETTERMENT LEVY and capital GAINS TAXMemorandum by the Minister of Land and Natural ResourcesThe Chancellor of the Exchequer (in C. (65) 100) wants to applyboth levy and capital gains tax to development value j I want to make itsubject to levy alone.    In this paper I will comment only briefly on this issue.    The arguments were set out in full for the meeting held by thePrime Minister on 29th June, which asked me to investigate thepossibility of making the levy progressive, on the basis that levy alone would apply.    (This can be done, as explained in C. (65) 96),2.       I have always wished to deal with development value solely by theLand Commission but, until the Finance Bill was published, this did notappear to be technically possible.    The opportunity now open to us to dealwith development value by means of the levy alone, and not by a cornbina-tion of capital gains tax and levy, is of great political importance in the presentation of our policy on land.    V/e are committed by the election manifesto to tackle the problem of the high development values realised in land transactions by means of a Land Commission, and the cabinet have approved the policy for doing this by a combination of powers of acquisition and of a levy on development value, acting as a balancingdevice to avoid the inequity of a two-price system.    The Land Commissionmust be seen to be the instrument by which the Government is dealingwith this problem..3.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that the capital gainstax should apply to development value on the grounds that this is parexcellence a capital gain and that to tax it in any other way would undermine the principle of the capital gains tax as a comprehensive and enduring tax.    I do not follow this argument.    The capital gains taxwill not in any case be comprehensive, and politically we must assume that our Land Commission policy will be an enduring one.    What is thedifficulty about taking development value outside the scope of capital gains tax, provided that it is instead caught by a betterment levy whichwill prirna facie be at a higher rate?    We are rightly regardingdevelopment value as a very special type of capital gain.    We should seek to recover as much of this value for the community as is consistent with leaving enough incentive with landowners to maintain the market inland.    This is a quite different criterion and approach from the fiscalbasis of the capital gains tax.C. (65) 102COPY NO.     *312th July, 1965CABINET-1-

4.       There is much to be said for starting by taking a modest portionof development value and increasing it.     On this basis, if we were to start by taking say 40 per cent and if this had to be done by a combination of capital gains tax and levy, the rate of levy  could be no more than15 per cent which makes the Commission appear hardly necessary.5.       The Chancellor fears that by taking development value out ofcapital gains tax he will be withdrawing reliefs which he has given in theFinance Hill to owner-occupiers of houses and taxpayers of small means.But only a small proportion of owner-occupiers with developable landattached to their houses would be subject to the levy and this could happenwhether the levy were separate or combined with the capital gains tax.Taxpayers of small means are not the kind of people who would generally be caught by a levy on development value in land.6.       He is also worried about retrospection, but the argurnent inparagraph 5 of his paper applies whether the levy is combined with thecapital gains tax or not.    There may be good reasons for not makingcapital gains tax retrospective but these do not apply to the recovery,by means of a charge, of development value created by the community.7.       The Chancellor puts forward a number of other points.    these were all dealt with at the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting.    They are alltechnical points which are either   capable of resolution or can be tolerated for the sake of the political advantage of presenting theGovernments policy on land in a positive way.F. T. W.Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, S. W. 1.12th July, 1965
