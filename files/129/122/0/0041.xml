gS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C, (65) 14-11st November, 1965CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES POLICYMernorandurn by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs on 1st September the Cabinet agreed on further steps in ourprices and incomes policy (C. C. (65) 46th Conclusions, Minute 1).On the following day I announced that the Government proposed tointroduce legislation early in the coming Session to give the national board for Prices and Incomes (N.3.P, I.) statutory powers to collectinformation and to call witnesses;   and to give the Government power by Order in Council:-(i) to require advance notification of intention to increase prices or charges;   and to require notification of claims relating to pay,hours   or other major improvements and prospective termsof settlement;(ii) to refer to the N. 3. P. I. in the national interest:-(a) any price, whether existing or proposed;  and(b) any claim or settlement;(iii)  to require the proposed price or pay increases to be deferred until after the Board had reported.I undertook that we would not bring these permissive provisions intoeffect without further consultation with the Trades Union Congress andthe Confederation of British Industries.2.      Work has been proceeding on the terms of this legislation andat its meeting on 28th October the Economic Development Committeegenerally approved proposals for inclusion in the Bill.    I think,however, that all my colleagues may like to be aware of what isproposed.    I am therefore circulating herewith an outline of theproposed legislation with a note on some of the most difficult points which are raised.    Cf these one of the most difficult is the preciseformulation of offences and penalties on the pay side and a letter whichI have received from the Attorney-General dealing with this point isalso attached,    I am sure that in the light of our previous decisions and consequent public statements we must proceed, despite thedifficulties,    &apos;3\it I wish my colleagues to be completely clear aboutthe possible political consequences.COPY NO.      - U

3.       Meanwhile we are also pressing ahead with the introduction of early warning arrangements on a non-statutory basis.     The detailswill be further discussed at an early date with the Trades UnionCongress and the Confederation of British Industries and with other organisations concerned.4,       The development of the prices and incomes policy will inevitably have implications for the role of arbitration bodies, wages councils and so forth.     The Economic Development Committee is stillconsidering how best v/e can proceed in this field.G. 3.Department of Economic Affairs, S.Y/.1.29th October, 1965

A % q.  eJ &apos;JANNEX a proposed LEGISLATION ON PRICES ANDincomesThe preparation of a Bill is in hand, for introduction early inthe next Session.    An outline of the main provisions which it isproposed to make is attached.    Among the points which arise on there are the following:(i)   there constitution of the N.3.P.L on a statutory basis (it isat present appointed under Royal Warrant as a Royal Commission)provides an opportunity to consider whether any changes are desirable in the light of experience during  the past few months.    I foresee that  /e shall need to increase the flow cf references to the Board - probably to about 20-25 cases a year, possibly more.    This means that we must provide scope in the Bill for increasing the Board in size.     Theoriginal idea (set out in Cmnd. 2577) of a separate Prices ReviewDivision and Incomes Review Division has not proved entirely appro -priate in practice and I propose to droj) it, leaving the Board with fairlywide powers to organise its work in the most efficient and convenientway.    The Board have also represented to me that the arrangement of special members drawn from panels nominated by the T. u, c. andthe employers1 organisations is not working well.    I have agreed withthe Bcard&apos;s Chairman that the use of special members should be dis-cretionary, not mandatory as under the Royal Warrant,    I shall need to discuss this with the T. U. C. and C. B.I.(ii)  It is going to be difficult even for the limited purpose of an early warning and standstill scheme to find satisfactory definitions for a^rice1 and for the commodities to which the provisions of the schemerelate.    Although we are not legislating for price control, the effectof the standstill on price increases while reports are being prepared bythe Beard will be that of a short-term price control.     The need will beto find definitions which will give a proper legal basis for enforcementand yet enable us to a.void the burden of sifting a mass of notifications of intended price changes.    It seems likely that we will have to con-concentrate on manufacturers&apos; prices and on those as charged either generally or tc different classes of buyers (for example, discounts onquantities) leaving out prices v/hich are settled by individual contracteven though this might leave a loophole in seme cases,(iii)  Some important prices and charges are already fixed by independent statutory bodies (London passenger fares, provincial busfares, inland air passenger fares, iron and steel and port charges).It would be undesirable to refer such cases to the N.B.P.I.  until thestatutory body has done the job of price determination which it v/as setup to do.     This would mean a dual jurisdiction which would be unsatisfactory in practice and would complicate the legislation.Moreover I think it would be only in exceptional circumstances that weshould want to refer a decision of a specialised body of this kind sub-sequently to the N.B.P.I., although one would not rule out the possi-bility of referring a general question relating to one of these particularprices and charges.&apos;   ?dhe main need is to ensure that these statutorybodies take into account the agreed criteria relating to the national interest.     The most straightforward v/ay cf achieving this seems to be

to include in the Bill a requirement that the bodies concerned are totake into account the same general considerations as the N. B. P. I, aswell as the various other considerations which are already enjoinedon them.     These bodies could then be exempted from the Bili&apos;s requirements in relation to statutory notification and standstill.(iv)  &quot;We are faced with some difficulties over offences and penaltieson the pay side.     The unions understandably are suspicious of any legislation which v/ould make them and their officers liable to offencesand penalties.    But if there is no obligation for unions to notify claims,they will not be touched directly by a statutory early warning system and we should be exposed to very strong criticism for making employersonly liable to penalties on prices and on pay as well.I have been in touch with the Attorney-General who, I am glad to say, thinks that we can find a way round these difficulties whichshould enable us to reassure the unions.     We have in mind that theobligation to notify pay claims should be placed both on the employer sand on workers&apos; representatives but that it should be a defence for either party to shew that they knew or had reasonable grounds forthinking that the other party had given this notification.     The employerwill almost always be ready to notify the receipt of a claim out of self-interest and it is unlikely that there v/ould be need to considerproceedings against unions for failure to notify and no proceedings couldbe taken without the authority of the Attorney-General.I am also considering, in consultation with the Attorney-Generaland the Minister cf Labour, a means of overcoming the objections whichwould be pressed if unions were left fully protected against any offenceof trying to force employers to act in breach of the latterrs obligationsduring the standstill period but, of course, without exposing unions to charges of criminal conspiracy at Common Law.    I hope that we maybe able to have some discussion cf this problem at cur meeting.(v)   The G.B.I. have pressed me to provide that the exercise of the compulsory notification and standstill powers should be subject to annual renewal.     I have told them that we can accept this.     There maybe strong pressure during the passage of the Bill for a time limit tobe set at least on the life of the powers in Part II of the Bill to apply a statutory early warning and standstill system but I think it is right notto concede this from the outset.

SECRET ,   A4 b iOUTLINE OF PRICES AND INCOMES bill the Secretary cf State is to have power to refer to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes for examination and report:(a) any question relating to the prices charged for goods, processesapplied to goods or for services of any class or description;(b) any question relating to claims or settlements for pay or other conditions of employment in any occupation, or class or description of occupation;(c) any question relating to prices or money incomes of any kind,2.       There is to be wide discretion in the framing of questions referred to the Board,3.       The Board is to be required to have regard to such considera-tions affecting the national interest as are set out in the White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639);  the Secretary of State may from time to time direct the Board to take other considerations of thenational interest into account.     Such directions will be by Order subjectto Affirmative Resolution procedure.    It is intended that the Secretaryof State will be required to consult employers1 and workers&apos; represen-tatives, etc. , before giving directions to the Beard about criteria ofthe national interest.4.       The Board is to report on every reference within two months(or, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, within a longer period not exceeding six months) and the Secretary of State is to lay beforeParliament every report by the -Board.5.       The Board is to have power to exclude from reports inferma-tion which, in its opinion, would damage the legitimate interests of anyperson or body, and the Secretary of State is to have a similar power in relation to information which would endanger national safety.6.       The Board is to consist of not less than nine and not mere than15 regular members appointed by the Secretary of State who will havepower by order to vary the maximum or minimum number.     Therewill be the usual provisions governing full and part-time appointments,periods of service, appointment of Deputy Chairman and related matters such as appointment of Staff and expenses.7.       There will be provision in the Bill for the Secretary of State,after consultation with employers&apos; and work people&apos;s organisations,to appoint two panels of special members for service in equal numbersfrom each at the discretion of the Chairman of the Board.8.       Subject to any general directions by the Secretary of State, theBoard is to have discretion to determine its own procedure;   theintention is to provide flexibility because the 3oard&apos;s work onreferences will be subject tc fairly narrow time limits and must becarried out expediticusiy.

9.       The Board is to have pov/er to require witnesses to attend and give evidence and to require the production of documents, returns orother information;  it will be an offence for any person to refuse orfail to do anything required of him in these respects or to make anyfalse statement.Part II:    Powers to impose a standstill on price increases and pay claims and settlements and to requireadvance notification.10.       The intention is that these powers will be held in reserve andthe provisions of Part II may be brought into operation by Order inCouncil which is to be subject to affirmative resolution;   any such order is to continue in effect for one year only but may from time totime be continued for a further period of one year by resolution of bothHouses of Parliament.11.       The powers of control are to be:(a) The Secretary of State is to have pov/er to require advancenotification of any proposed increase in prices or change in pay or conditions of employment in relation to any class or description of goods, processes to goods or services, or inrelation to any type of services, or in relation to any type ofemployment which he may prescribe by order, and no suchincrease or change is to be made without his consent during a standstill period of thirty clays from the date cf notification.(b) If within this standstill period the Secretary of State refers theincrease or change to the Board for report, the standstill is tocontinue until the Board has reported and their report has been laid before Parliament.    La the absence of a reference to theBoard during the thirty day period, the proposed increase orchange may be made on its expiration.(c) The standstill will apply to any prices or changes of pay whichform the subject cf a reference to the Board whether or notadvance notification of them has been required.     But it willbe possible for general matters relating to prices and incomesto be referred to the Board without entailing a standstill.12.       The Secretary of State is to have wide power to prescribe byorder the classes or descriptions of goods, processes to goods orser vices to which the requirements of advance notification and stand-still are to apply and similarly for claims and settlements on the payside.13.       It is to be an offence in relation to price increases for theperson concerned:(a) to fail to give notice of a price increase as required by theorder;        .(b) to increase a price of which notification is required if nonotification has in fact been given;4 b &amp;

to increase a price where notification has been duly given within thirty days of the date of notification unless theSecretary of State has given notice that he does not intend to refer the matter to the Board;(d)to increase a price where the Secretary of State has given notice of reference to the Board before the date on whichthe report of the Board is laid before Parliament.14.It is to be an offence in relation to pay claims and settlements:(a)for any trade union or other body of representatives of workers and for any employers or organisations cf employers (of a class affected by the order and making or receiving a claim of the kind prescribed), to fail tc notify the claim or thereceipt cf the claim within a specified period.    It shall be a defence for either party to show that they knew, or hadreasonable grounds for thinking mat the other party had given such notification;   no proceedings under this provisionmay be taken without the authority of the Attorney-General;(b) for any employer to fail to notify any agreed settlement of a kind prescribed or to put it into operation within thirty days of such notification unless the Secretary of State has given notice to the employer that he does not intend tc refer thematter to the Board;(c) for the employer to implement the agreed settlement wherethe Secretary cf State refers the matter to the Board priorto the date on which the report is laid before Parliament.15.       There will be supplementary provisions as to the supply ofinformation.16.       Provision will be made for penalties, including penalties forthe rendering of false information.

COPY OF A LETTER DATED 26th OCTOBER FR.CI/.&quot;. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, TO THE FIRST SECRETARY CF STATEPrices and Incomes BillParagraph (iv) of your memorandum of 20tli October to the ministerial Committee on Economic Development (Annex A) refers to two problems in this proposed legislation on v/hich I have been ashed toadvise.The former of these concerns the sanctions which the Billshould provide for failure by trade unions or employers (includingemployers&apos; associations) to notify the making or receiving of claims in respect of wages or conditions of employment.After giving further thought to this matter, I confirm the view which I expressed at our meeting on 15th October that it would be cliff i-cult to justify a provision which places the onus exclusively uponemployers.    As v/as pointed out at our meeting, there are precedents for placing; obligations upon trade &quot;unions to provide information, failure to comply with which is punishable by a small fine.    I suggest accor-dingly that failure to notify the making or receipt of claims should besubject to a fine.    In connection with this offence we discussed thequestion whether liability should be incurred if, for instance, a tradeunion fails to notify the making of the claim but the employer to theknowledge of the trade union duly notifies its receipt.     In thesecircumstances I cannot think that the trade union would be prosecutedif, as I propose, it is to be provided that no prosecution may be broughtfor this offence save by me or with my consent. &apos; I do not believe thatany Attorney-General would sanction a prosecution in such a case.    If,however, it would materially assist the passage cf the Bill to relievetrade unions expressly of liability in these circumstances, it would bepossible for the provision creating the offence to state that it should bea defence for a trade union or employer, as the case may be, to showthat some other person or body, who v/as under an obligation to notify the claim, had duly done so.The second problem is far more difficult.     It raises the questionwhether sanctions should be applied in relation to breaches of a stand-still affecting proposed increases in pay or improvements in conditionsof employment, and if so, what sanctions.    I have given careful thought to the possibility of imposing a duty to observe the standstill period anddealing with a prospective or actual breach by means of proceedings for an injunction,     I have come to the conclusion that this would not be feasible.    Nor would it help to deal with the difficulty that once it becomes the legal duty of employers to observe the standstill, anagreement by employees to strike in order to try to compel an employer to act in breach of the standstill would be a criminal conspiracy indie-table as such - it may be at the instance of private prosecutors.If the proposed machinery is to be effective I see no way ofescaping the necessity to make it an offence for an employer to act in breach of the standstill.     If this is done, unhappily it follows from this as a matter of law that any industrial action taken by a union or workers

to compel an employer to raise pay or improve conditions in breach ofa standstill will be illegal and the existing protection contained in tradeunion legislation will not afford protection against either civil liability in tort or criminal liability, e, g. , a charge of conspiracy.From a presentational point of view, however, I feel that itwould be difficult to justify imposing sanctions upon employers unlessat the same time some sanction were imposed upon those who seek to compel them to break the lav/ in this way.    Squally I have no doubt thatthe consequences (e. g. , unlimited liability in tort and criminal liability in conspiracy) which would follow if the Bill failed to preserve theprotections in existing trade union legislation would be much too severe,apart from being politically unacceptable.     The legislation protectingacts done in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute has as recently as this year been extended by the Trade Disputes Act 1965(c. 40) pending the Report of the Royal Commission on Tra.de Unions and employers&apos; Associations and it would be politically impossible to under-mine these protections at the present time.In these very difficult circumstances the best solution I can think of may lie along the following lines -(a) to provide that it shall be an offence for any person or body(including a trade union) to take action, whether by breaking orurging others to break their contracts or otherwise, which is designed to compel, induce or influence an employer to act in breach of a standstill;  and(b) to provide that no person shall incur any civil or,  save as provided in (a), criminal liability in consequence of the actsthere referred to by reason only of the fact that they were intended to compel the employer to act in breach of a standstill.This would protect employees against the risk of indictment for criminal conspiracy and civil proceedings for damages.As you will remember at our last meeting I suggested thatprosecutions for the offence of failing to notify claims for increases in pay or changes in conditions of employment should not be undertaken without my sanction.    I feel that this safeguard should be extended to alloffences in connection with notifications required under the Bill and tothose involving breaches or the inducement of breaches of the standstillby employers.     The effects of these offences will vary greatly in theirseriousness and in their economic consequences and it seems right that the Attorney-General should have the ultimate decision.The level of penalties fox- offences under the Bill is clearly amatter on which we must consult the Home Secretary.     Subject to this,however, I would suggest that trie penalty for failure to notify claimsshould be of the order of 5.50.    In the case of the more seriousoffences of an employer acting in breach cf the standstill period or ofany attempt by another per-son to induce him tc do so, I would suggest a penalty of  500 or three months1 imprisonment, or both, the finebeing unlimited in the case of a corporate body.I am sending copies of this letter to the Minister of Labour andthe Treasury Solicitor.-9-secret     ^
