The question of publicationof the White Paper is for discussion by the Cabinet on Tuesday,20th July.2.       The draft includes major amendments to the text which haverecently been made to meet points raised by the Treasury and theDepartment of Economic Affairs.    In order to expedite circulation of the paper the amendments have been incorporated without a revisionof the paragraph numbering.    It has not been possible to include anumber of detailed amendments on matters of secondary importance which have been proposed by departments and which have been agreedor are under discussion by officials.(Signed)    BURKE trend cabinet Office, S. W.m 1.16th July, 1965

In this White Paper we describe the policies by which the Governmentwill be guided and the ways in which we propose to play our part in meetingthe needs of the developing countries.     We do not specify the amounts of aid which we propose to provide in any particular periods.     This must depend on the strength of our own economy and of our balance of payments.Nevertheless the Government recognises the need to make our full contribution in the co-operative effort to promote the development of the poorercountries and the expansion of the world economy.     Within the limits ofour resources we shall do all we can to contribute to that effort.     Theselimits themselves make it all the more necessary that our aid programme should be planned and managed in a way which will most effectively help the countries with which we deal.     One of the main purposes of this paper is to describe what we are doing to achieve this.PREFACE

I   -   Motives and Objectives1.     Ilia objective o  the British aid programme is to help developing countries in their efforts to raise living standards.     Our purpose istherefore to promote social and economic development.     But developmentmeans more than reducing poverty and unemployment.     It means fulfillingaspirations towards steady and continued social and economic progress.     it means the transformation of traditional societies into modern ones.     our aim is to do ?/hat lies in our power to help the developing countries toprovide their people with the material opportunities of using their talents,of living a full - and happy life and of steadily improving their lot.2.     The basis of the aid programme is therefore a moral one.     The programmeoperates through the transfer of economic resouroes and human skills.   Itcan at the same time be defined in political terms.     The international discussion of aid and the programmes to which it gives rise are an important part of international politics;   they include some of the most importantdealings between nations.     But we must be clear about the political objectives which an aid programme can and cannot be expected to achieve.Aid is a means of promoting long term economic development.     To be effectiveit needs to be given over time and with due preparation to ensure that it is used effectively.     Aid is not a means of winning the friendship of individual countries, though we are glad to offer aid to our friends.The process of development may sometimes increase strains, for a time atleast, and we should not expect aid to be an insurance against politicaltensions.     Nevertheless, we must recognise that poverty in a world of growing wealth causes discontent and unrest to which economic and socialdevelopment is the only possible answer.     We must therefore be ready to share our wealth and knowledge so as to help promote the progress and strengthen the stability of the developing countries by increasing thematerial well-being of their peoples.3.     This makes it all the more necessary to use our aid to the besteffect.     There are many claims on our resources, and at present our balance of payments imposes severe limitations on our capacity to help.We recognise the advantages of giving aid through international organisa-/tions

tions and we intend to increase our contributions in company with otherdonors as the needs of these organisations grow and as our own resourcespermit.     We intend to give the highest priority to technical assistance,which provides skilled men and women to help in development and above allin the education and training of local people and which is often a pre-requisite for enabling a country to make good use of financial aid.4-     The financial aid which we give to individual countries will remain,nevertheless, the largest part of our programme.     In allocating bilateralaid we believe that preference should be given so far as possible to thosecountries and regions where it will have the greatest effect on income per head.     This will depend on a number of things, including the form and typeof our aid and the contribution of other donors.     It will depend on thematerial and human resources of the developing countries and,above all, or.their readiness and ability to make the effort to develop.     We must also take account of the relative poverty of the countries with which we deal andthe needs which this creates.     In giving preference to those to whosodevelopment our contribution will make the greatest difference we try to takea long view. ,5.     Countries which are members of the Commonwealth have a special claim onus.     The Commonwealth is one of the few associations, short of the united nations itself, in which rich and poor can talk on equal terms.     Itillustrates how international co-operation can be achieved across some of the bar.ei.ers which now divide the world.     We have important historical linksand current ties with all independent Commonwealth countries and specialobligations towards the territories still dependent ora&amp;s..   We have, untilnow, provided relatively little to foreign countries.     By the criteriawe have discussed, more foreign countries could make a claim to our aidthan we have been able to help but there are obvious limits in our present economic circumstances to what we can do in this broader field.     We must also avoid dispersing our assistance too widely in amounts which may not make an effective contribution to development.     We shall hope, nevertheless,to be in a position to increase our aid to foreign countries.

6.     British and any other aid will be most effective where it forms an integral part of a coherent and co-operative effort to implement a wellprepared development plan.     If there are several donors helping one country and they are following different objectives in giving aid, or their efforts are not properly co-ordinated either with one another or with those ofthe country receiving aid, development will not be most effectively achieved.Our contribution will have the best opportunity to accelerate developmenteither where it is big enough to play an effective part in the developmentprocess, or whore there are satisfactory arrangements for the co-ordinationof all donors&apos; aid both with each other and with the efforts of the countryreceiving aid.7.     The provision of aid serves our own long-term economic interest.Britain stands to prosper if the poorer countries in which two-thirds of theworld&apos;s population live are able to share in world development.     We have aspecial interest in encouraging the expansion of international trade;aid can play an important part in&quot; this.     By helping to raise incomes inthe developing countries we can provide expanding markets for exports andsafeguard the supply of our imports and the return on our investment.Those are real advantages, and we, should seek to secure them as far as wecan.     But they must be secondary to the primary purpose of aid.     Moreovereven though aid may be in the form of loans which have to be repaid and onwhich we receive interest, it involves the transfer to economic resourceswithout the expectation of a full economic return.     Its primary aim is tosupply the country receiving aid with goods and people needed for development.A clear distinction should therefore be kept between aid and commercialcredit.8.     We give aid because in the widest sense we believe it to be in our interest to do so as a member of the world community.     We recognise that itis in the nature of aid that wo should accept an economic sacrifice whengiving it.     To describe as aid transactions which do not entail suchsacrifices would incur the risk of flustration and ill will.     This does not mean that the present economic sacrifices cannot yield benefits to us inthe future.     It means that these benefits should not be the main motivationfor giving aid and that they must not conflict with development.

9.     Since the war Britain has adapted herself to great changes.     New nations have emerged, and the Empire has been transferred into the modern Commonwealth.The coming years will require great efforts of imaginative adjustment to a world in which new nations seek to use their independence for social andeconomic advancement.     It leads to the need for action, both in the public and in the private sphere.     The second has been recognised by the remarkablegrowth during recent years of the work of voluntary organisations, butlarger action is needed in the field of public policy.     The solutions to theproblems of the developing countries are neither simple nor obvious.   Theywill involve new experiements, new methods, now institutions, new relation-ships.     There are many paths to development.   Our aim is to help the developing countries to find and pursue them.

II - THE PACE OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPjMjT10.   The harsh fact from which we must begin is that the majority ofthe human race still lives in poverty.   Moreover, despite the efforts and achievements of the past 20 years the devel opment gap betweenadvanced and developing nations has been widening.   The rate of growth of the poorer countries of the world quickened after the second worldwar0   Their average income per head increased in real terms in the1950&apos;s, but since incomes in the developed industrial countries wererising at a faster rate, the inequality in the distribution of worldincome grew,   In the developing countries as a whole, average incomerose ly rather over a quarter in this decade, but in i960 this averagewas still less than  50 a head.   In the developed countries it rosein the same period by a third, and in i960 was slightly over  500 per head.   Since then, their development has become faster again,,11o   Those averages cover wide ranges within each group.   Thus in east Africa, India and Pakistan incomes averaged in i960 (as they stilldo)  20 to  JO a head; in some countries of Latin America and the carribbean they averaged over  100 a head.   Among the rich countries of Western Europe,,   including Britain, incomes were- 400 to  500 ahead in 1960; in the United States they were nearly  1,000*12e   Although the development of the poorer countries was relativelyfast in the 1950!s compared with the past, the rate of growth of per capita income noticeably slowed down in the second half of the decade(insertTable l) (see Table I) and this trend has continuedD13,   There are of course exceptions to these generalisations but thsgrowth rate of each of three main regions (Africa, Asia and latin america) was affected by this slowing -down in the 1950&apos;s.   This hasbeen particularly marked for agriculture (see Table Ii).   In the 1960&apos;s,total farm output has fallen behind the rate of population increase,,In fact, in Latin America and the Far East, agricultural production/per&apos;*See footnote to Table I

(Insert    per head is still below the levels of the 1930&apos;s and is falling.II and    Agricultural growth at its current pace means that food supplies lagand this acts as a brake on the growth of other sectors.   Table IIIshows that the rise in output in mining,  and electricity and gas, although still moderately fast, has also become slower inthe 1960*so14.   In the industrialised countries, on the other hand, development has almost regained the pace of the early 1950&apos;s.   This is not a cause for dissatisfaction in itself from the viewpoint of developing countries; indeed, their own economic development depends to a great extent on the economic strength of the advanced countries.   But the widening gap can create political tensions, especially if the prosperity of the developing countries is not increasing.159   What has been the cause of this setback?   Three main trends havebeen responsible.(a)   The ^growing shortage of foreign exchange 16.   Imports are the life blood of economic development: developing countries need imported tractors, plant, machinery, building materials and lorries, as well as fertilisers, fuel   and all the other &quot;inputs&quot;essential to the realisation of their development plans.   To purchasethese imports, they must have a rapidly growing supply of foreign exchange either earned, through exports or supplied through private investment or government aid.   In the past fifteen years, the rise inthe total foreign exchange from these various sources has beeninadequate.17.   During the first half of the 1950&apos;s, post-war reconstructioncontinued at a fast pace in continental Western Europe and commoditymarkets were further strengthened by the Korean war boom.   The export earnings of the developing countries rose strongly (see Table IV) andthe mounting supplies of foreign exchange permitted growing purchasesTablesIII)/of

of capital goods.   In the later years of this decade, when the paoe ofthe advance in the industrialised countries slackened, commodity prices fell (see diagram A) and the value of exports of primary(Insertdiagram   products rose at a much slower paoe,A and table Df)&apos; 18.   During both these five-year periods, the imports of the poorercountries rose faster in value than their exports.   This was made possible partly by the fact that less of their earnings were being put to reserve.   In 1950 foreign exchange reserves were being accumulatedat a fast rate by these countries, owing mainly to the Korean war.   In1955 reserves were being built more slowly and in i960 they declineda little (see Table V).   More important, the flow of capital was increasing throughout this decade; in the first half there was anincrease in private investment and also in the supply of loans and(insert   Sran^s by governments of the developed countries; in the second halfTable V) ^nerQ was a snarp increase in the flow of public capital 019.   Nonetheless, owing to the weakness in export markets, the total supply of foreign exchange to the developing countries grew more slowlytowards the end of the decade.   Short-term credits were increasinglyused to relieve exchange shortages.   Exchange and import controlswere tightened in many of these countries, taxes were raised and programmes of import substitution were pursued more vigorously.   Inthe developing countries as a whole production increased more rapidly than imports.   But the slower growth of foreign exchange receiptslimited the resources available to finance development.   Some govern-ments were compelled to cut their development plans.   Elsewhere,especially in Latin America, attempts to force the pace when exports were only rising slowly aggravated inflationary pressures, and stop-go policies disrupted development./20.

20.   In 1961 the United States economy entered a phase of rapid growthwhich has been maintained up to the present time.   After 19^2commodity prices, especially of non-ferrous metals, rose and the valueof exports from the poorer countries to the developed countries once more increased at a fairly fas4- rate.   Communist countries were alsobecoming increasingly important as buyers in world commodity markets.Despite these improvements there was a further decline in the paceat which the volume of imports of the developing countries was rising.21.   While production of primary products has continued to increase,commodity prices, after reaching a peak early in 1964, have weakenedagain, despite the continued fast expansion in the industrialised countries.   Nor is there any certainty that this rate of expansion willbe maintained.   The second half of the 196o&apos;s may show, therefore,as did the second half of the 195C&apos;s, that the developing countriescannot increase their export earnings enough to support even moderategrowth rates.   The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly,which designated the 19^0&apos;s as the &quot;development decade&quot;, laid downas a specific target that by the end of the decade the income of developing countries should grow at a rate of at least 5fo a year.   Butthe present outlook for achieving this is bleak.   However much the developing countries may struggle to help themselves by expandingexports, or developing the manufacture of import substitutes, theredoes not seem any prospect of their being able to finance out of theirovrn. resources the rising imports which development demands.(k)   The growing shortage of qualified manpower22,   Another obstacle to the development of many poorer countries has been the shortage of professional and technical personnel.   Inmany of them the number of scientists, engineers, agriculturalexperts, artisans etc., is low even in-relation tothe current economic levels.   The attempt to raise output at a fast/pace

pace is sooner or later hampered by a lack of personnel to manage and work modern projects.   In the developing countries, engineers andscientists frequently number less than one per 1,000 of theseemployed; in some African countries, the number is less than one per10,000; in more developed countries, it is usually higher than one per100.   Even more important the great majority of people in africa south of the Sahara and Asia have had no chance of education, or too little education to acquire literacy.   The rural population in manydeveloping countries lacks the necessary technical knowledge to raiseoutput sufficiently to enter the cash economy.23.   In many countries, especially in Africa, the shortage of trained personnel has been an even more serious factor than the shortage offoreign exchange in inhibiting development.   The situation has beenmade more difficult by the departure of expatriate staff at precisely the same time as the Governments concerned were trying to speed upprogress through development plans covering the whole economy.   Theshortage of experienced personnel means that preparation of projectsis slow and planning offices are not strong enough for the immensetasks they face.   The big educational programmes which have beenadopted throughout the less developed areas of the world will eventuallyease manpower problems; but it will be many years before shortages atthe highest professional levels are eliminated.   Qualified local staff are coming forward in increasing numbers, but the total needs are continually growing, and the period of maximum administrative strainis still ahead for many developing countries,(c)   Increasing population pressure 24.   A further reason why income per head in the poorer countriesgrew more slowly in recent years was the acceleratien in the growth of population (see Table I).   A wide gap has now opened between the paceat which population grows in developed countries compared with less/developed

developed countries.   In the former, while birth rates (at 15 to 25per 1,000 with an overall average of 22) are still higher than deathrates (about 10 per 1,000) the difference between these two rates ismuch less than it was a few decades ago.   In almost all the poorercountries, on the other hand, birth rates have remained high withan overall average of 41 to 42 per 1,000 of the population.   Deathrates especially among infants have fallen dramatically owing toimproved health services but fertility has not yet adjusted itself tothe reduction in mortality.25.   Nevertheless death rates in the poorer countries still remainmuch higher than in the richer ones.   In 1955-58, for example, thefigures were 9.6 per 1,000 for Sweden, 20.6 for Mexico and 20,,0 forrural India; in Africa the average was about 27.   Despite the declinein infant mortality, 12^6 out of every 1,000 children born in ruralIndia in 1958 to 1959 died before they reached their first birthday.The corresponding figure for Mexico in 19^2 was 70; in Sweden, in thesame year it was 15.   With improved social services^ mortality maysoon fall still further in the poorer countries.26.   The age composition of the population reflects these trends.The older groups in the advanced countries form a large proportionof the population.   In the developing countries, on the other hand,over half the population is lessthan 20 years old, and a largeproportion of it is moving into age groups in which fertility is so high and mortality low.   In consequence, even if attitudes change andfertility rates decline, and even if infant mortality (and mortalityat higher ages) falls no further, the population will continue to grow at a fast rate for some decades.27.   Recent United Nations estimates show that the total populationof the poorer countries may well grow between i960 and 1970 at separately of 2.5 per cent a year - rather faster than in the 1950&apos;s.: /IN

There is already surplus labour in country districts and the agricultural sector cannot absorb further increases whenfarm output is only rising slowly.   Manufacturing is not providingbig increases in employment; in fact in a number of countries eraploy-ment in this sector has fallen in recent years.   Even in countriesinhere it has continued to rise, it has often failed to keep pace withthe natural growth of urban population.

SIII&apos; THE TRANSFER OF RESOURCES31.   The industrial countries transfer resources to the developing countriesin a number of ways.     Private capital investment and public loans and grantsmake it possible for the developing countries to have much bigger investment programmes than they could possibly finance out of their own savings.     Thisflow, from another pant of view, has enabled them to cover capital and income(payable on previous investments) flowing in the opposite direction, and yet to import more than their exports alone could pay for.32.   Technical assistance fills some of the gaps in the supply of quqlifiedmanpower.     In industrial, agricultural and commercial fields, experts -and the employees of private firms working overseas - help to transferadvanced techniques.     Aid has contributed to the improvement of social services;    sickness and mortality have been reduced and (more recently) steps taken to control fertility.     The provision of teachers and overseas training facilities bring nearer the day when the developing countries will be able tofind sufficient numbers of professional and technical personnel from amongtheir own citizens.Financial flows to the developing countries33.   Private long-term investment by the industrialised countries in theless developed countries climbed after the war, but then started to declineat the end of the 1950&apos;s.     Although it recovered in 1964s it was still belowthe level of the early 1960&apos;s.     (See Table VII.)     But export credits have continued to grow, especially in 1964&apos;34*   The total gross flow of official funds from OECD industrial countriesrose rapidly from an average of  700 millions for the years 1950-1955 &quot;to 1,250 millions in 1956 and  2,500 millions in I96I.     It then, like long-term private investment, fell back, but recovered in 1964 to a level nearthat of 1961.35&apos;   Although the supply of capital by the governments of developed countriesno longer shews an upward trend, the receipts of official capital by the developing countries have continued to rise, because multilateral organisa-tions have in recent years been disbursing funds more rapidly than they havereceived them.     A number of relatively ne*T organisations, the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, the financial agencies of the European Economic Community/and

CONFIDENTIAL . ------- -        42and the International Development Association (the affiliate of theInternational Bank set up in 1961 to make &quot;soft&quot; loans), have been sharply-increasing their disbursements to developing countries.     On the other hand,subscriptions are no longer being collected on a big scale;   the bulk of theaggregate capital of the multilateral organisations, including the international bank (the largest multilateral supplier of funds to the developing countries)was contributed at the time of their establishment, although in some cases thesubscriptions of individual countries have been raised, or additional capitalsubscribed by new members, and the International Development Associationcontinues to acquire resources by agreed general increases in contributions.36.   The International Monetary Fund is not a development agency and its operations are not covered by Table VII, but it has provided an additionalsource of finance.     The upward trend in the value of its assistance to the developing countries reflects in some degree its growing membership, but it also indicates the increasing pressures on their foreign exchange reserves.The facilities provided to developing countries were very limited in theearly 1950&apos;s,but they became substantial later.     In the period i960 to 1963big additional standby facilities were made available to developing countrieseach year (especially in i960 and I961), and in the four years the total roseby more than  450 millions.     Over the same period net drawings by thesecountries increased their indebtedness by over  200 millions.     In 19&amp;4?because of the sharp rise in exports, while the value of standby arrangementsoutstanding continued to rise, the rise was smaller ( 55 millions), and therewas a slight reduction in the indebtedness of these countries to the Fund.Financial flows out of the developing countries37-   While the total financial flows towards the developing countries have risen only slightly since 1961, flows in the opposite direction continue torise strongly.38.   Data on the export of private capital by the nationals of developing countries are scarce.     A special I.M.F. study, excluding the flight ofcapital from Algeria, gives a total for the average annual outflow fromall developing countries of  160 million in the period   1957-1962, i.e./rathgr

and the International Development Association ($xe affiliate of theInternational Bank set up in 1961 to make &quot;soft&quot; loans), have been sharply-increasing their disbursements to developing countries.     On the other hand,subscriptions are no longer being collected on a big scale;   the bulk of theaggregate capital of the multilateral organisations, including the international bank (the largest multilateral supplier of funds to the developing countries)was contributed at the time of their establishment, although in some cases thesubscriptions of individual countries have been raised, or additional capitalsubscribed by new members, and the International Development Associationcontinues to acquire resources by agreed general increases in contributions.36.   The International Monetary Fund is not a development agency and its operations are not covered by Table VII, but it has provided an additionalsource of finance.     The upward trend in the value of its assistance to the developing countries reflects in some degree its growing membership, but it also indicates the increasing pressures on their foreign exchange reserves.The facilities provided to developing countries were very limited in theearly 1950&apos;s,but they became substantial later.     In the period i960 to 1963big additional standby facilities were made available to developing countrieseach year (especially in i960 and 1961), and in the four years the total roseby more than  450 millions.     Over the same period net drawings by thesecountries increased their indebtedness by over  200 millions.     In 19^4,because of the sharp rise in exports, while the value of standby arrangementsoutstanding continued to rise, the rise was smaller ( 55 millions), and therewas a slight reduction in the indebtedness of these countries to the Fund.Financial flows out of the developifg countries37*   While the total financial flows towards the developing countries have risen only slightly since I96I, flows in the opposite direction continue torise strongly.38.   Data on the export of private capital by the nationals of developing countries are scarce.     A special I.M.F. study, excluding the flight ofcapital from Algeria, gives a total for the average annual outflow fromall developing countries of  160 million in the period   1957-1962, i.e./rather

rather more than a quarter of new private investment in these countries.39&apos;   There have been a rising trend in the repayment of official bilateraldebt by developing countries (see Table VIIl).     This had been at very lowlevels in the early 1950&apos;s, but now reflects the increasing flow of loans.In 1961 the level was abnormally high because a United States loan to Brazilmatured in that year, and it fell back in 1962, but the rise was then resumed.Incomplete information for 1964 shows a sharp jump of about ^Qffo in repayments.Amortisation of debts to multilateral organisations also continues to riserapidly;    this applies mainly to loans by the International Bajik&apos;, since theother agencies do not, as yet, have a large amount outstanding.40.     The total of interest payments on public debt and the income derivedby foreign private investors is increasing steadily.     Allowing for thecountries not included in Table VIII (which, however, covers most of the largedeveloping countries) the total investment income flowing from these countries was probably in the region of  1,000 million annually by the beginning of the1960&apos;s.     Part of this was re-invested end is included in private capital investment in Table VII.     Taken together, the reverse flows of capital, apartfrom private capital sent abroad by nationals of developing countries, plusinvestment income absorb over one-third of the financial resources transferred.In the case of the International Bank, repayments and interest charges nowoff-set nearly two-thirds of gross disbursement to developing countries.Net official financial flows from donor countries.41.   Net disbursements of official capital (after allowing for repayments)were running on a plateau from 1961 to 1963 (see Table Ix);   this continued in 1964 because the increase in the repayment of official debt by the developing countries at least balanced the increase intheir receipts of official capital.     The net flow was; constant not merely for developed countries as a whole;   there is no major donor for which the flow Ms grown^ /markedlyFlow of&apos;Private Capital from Developing to Developed Countries.(E/Conf 46/20 I964).     The estimates are based on a short-termasset changes plus &quot;net errors and omissions&quot; for a large numberof developing countries.     /&quot;This outflow may well have increased in recent years ff

markedly since 1961 and United States disbursements, which up to 1963 had continued to grow, fell back somewhat in 1964-     Since the economies of the developed countries have been expanding, the levelling off in the officialflow means that this has declined in relation to gross national product.For members of OECD&apos;s Development Assistance Committee, taken together, thenet official flow fell from 0.75$ of total gross national product in 1961 to0.59$ in I964.42.   Commitments of finance from the Sino-Soviet countries rose sharply in thesecond half of the 1950&apos;s, from practically nothing to over  400 million in1961.     Commitments then declined, but gross disbursements have continued torise, reaching about  150 million in 1963-     Repayments were probably lessthan  20 million in that year, but the net contribution from this source was still less than 70$ of what was supplied by imembers of .0ECD.Future prospects for official financial flows43-     In 1964 government aid commitments rose, especially in the United States,and this foreshadows a moderate increase in gross aid disbursements in 1965,though an increase in subsequent years will depend on whether the rise inCongressional appropriations is resumed.     A continued expansion in the flow of funds by multilateral agencies would require a higger supply from official sources bhan in the past two years.     Some increase can be expected;   arrange-menta have been made for new contributions to the International development association amounting to  268 million over three years, starting in 1965-44-   On the other hand   the burden of servicing both bilateral and multilateralpublic debt will continue to grow rapidly andtlris prospect must be set againstthe probable increase, for 1965 at least, in gross disbsursements.     Thefuture cost of debt service reflects the rising volume of loans in the past,and also the terms on which these have been made.     The external public debt of developing countries, including officially guaranteed private debt,has increased about four-fold in the last ten years and is now of the orderof  10,000 millions;   in addition , large private debts are outstanding.Although more than two-thirds of official capital commitments to developing countries, including contributions to multilateral agencies, is still made up of grants, or contributions for which no repayment in convertible/ currency

currency is required, the ratio of loans to grants has tended to rise.     Inrecent years there has been a tendency towards softer loans in which changesin the conditions of British aid played a part (See Chapter VIII).45*   The burden cf debt varies both in its nature and its distribution.     Someof the African countries which have most recently become independent have a relatively light burden of public deb-1-:   much of their debt is recentlyacquired and does not yet carry full service in interest and amortization.Some however, like other developing countries, especially in Latin America,have had increasing recourse to export credits in recent years, the serviceof which has accumulated rapidly.    (About half the guararteed export creditscovered in Table VII are for less than five years and a big volume of exportoredits is not covered by this table.)     In a number of cases commitments for interest and repayment of debt are equivalent to more than Vjfo of export earnings, and this percentage is rising.     The debt of other countries arisespredominantly from long term borrowing for development.     This is true ofIndia, where debt payments, for example, would amount to over 40 per cent,of Western aid during the Fourth Five Year Plan, if aid were continued atthe present level and in the present terms.     Since many recipients are inpersistent payments difficulties, the terms of aid, as well as its amount,will be an influence of increasing importance on overseas development./46.

Transfer to skills to the developing countries46.       The two main channels for transferring skills arc the provision of qualified people to the developing countries and the training in donorcountries of their nationals.47&apos;      Expenditure on bilateral technical assistance by DAC countries, coveringboth these forms of help, totalled $917 millions in 1964 and is still rising.It is difficult to compare data from different sources, especially for earlier years, but the number of exports working overseas under bilateral programmeswho were wholly or partly financed by DAC countries remained more or lessconstant between 1962 and 1964 at about 80,000.     The increase in expenditure is due partly to increases in costs and partly to the fact that some countries,such as Britain, have assumed a higher proportion of the cost of exports than hitherto,48.       Total disbursements of United Nations technical assistance (including theregular programmes of the Specialised Agencies) rose sharply during the 1950&apos;from an annual average of $74 millions in the years 1950-55 to $203 millions in 1963-     Expenditure under an additional programme, the United NationsSpecial Fund, which was created in 1959 mainly to carry out pro-investmentsurveys, reached $38 millions in 1963-   While the number of experts in thefiold under U.N. programmes is growing, it is still relatively small compared to those working under national programmes, the number at the end of 1964 beingloss than 5-.-CO0?   &quot;the continued upward trend does not mean a big increase in thetotal supply of technical assistance to developing countries.   /New material from New York is awaited for this paragraph^.49*      There are reverse flows of manpovrer as well as capital.   While thenumber of people employed under bilateral technical assistance programmes hasbeen growing, they have only partially filled the places of expatriate officials who have been leaving the service of overseas governments.   In addition, alarge number of professional and skilled people from developing countries isemigrating permanently to developed countries.   There has therefore almost certainly been a net flow; of qualified people out of the developing countriesin recent years.   The situation varies, however, from country to country and/ some-.

some must have gained on balance.   The not outward flow is in any caso slowing down in countries which have bean independent for some years.50.   Training programmes for students from overseas have been growing.   Duringthe last few years the number being educated abroad under bilateral programmeshas risen to over 40,000;   and increasing numbers are being trained under inter-national programmes.   There is still, however, an acute shortage of senior people and the supply of experienced nationals will remain inadequate for many yearsthroughout almost the complete range of professional jobs.Summary51.       The argument in this and the preceding chapter can be summarised asfollows?   economic growth in the developing countries was relatively fast duringthe first half of the 1950&apos;s, but has slowed down since then.   In the first half of the decade it was helped by high commodity prices and an inflow of capital;in the second half by a sharp increase in aid;   the increase in private and publicfinancial flows to the developing countries has tended to level off since 1961(see diagram B).   Financial flows in the opposite direction havo however continuedto grow.52.       A further limiting factor has boon a shortage of qualified manpower,accentuated in a number of cases by the outflow of expatriate staff.   There hasbeen a substantial increase in the transfer of human resources by technical assistance, but the main element in this-bila-teral assistance-is no longergrowing so rapidly and the not transfer is apparently still towards the developed countries.53-       Population has grewn rapidly in the developing countries owing to the declinein death rates, while birth rates have bean maintained.   This, combined with theslower rate of growth of total output, has meant a fall in the rate of economic growth in terms of income per head.54*       One consequence of the increase of population combined with The relativelyslow economic growth has been to increase underemployment and decreaseproduction per head especially in rural areas./55*

55&apos;        Despite the general tendency towards softer terms of loans, manydeveloping countries face a rapidly growing burden of service of external debt,which is threatening to limit their development.56.       The total suppy of foreign exchange from trade and aid will need to risemore rapidly if the developing countries are to afford the increasing importstheir faster development requires.   This was reflected in UNCTAD recommendations which called for more liberal trade policies and also a larger transfer offinancial resources to enable the developing countries to grow more quickly.Yet the trend of average commodity prices has turned downwards, with damaging consequences for the export earnings of a number of developing countries.57*      At the same time, it seems unlikely that in present conditions private capital (allowing for reverse flows) will fill more than a small part of thedifference between the need for foreign exchange and its supply. The need foraid will therefore be greater.   This does not merely mean financial aid;   many countries have a greater need for increased technical assistance.58.       The inequalities in income distribution are a problem for the whole world, not merely for Britain.   The developing countries need improvedeconomic programmes, but the aid policy of the industrialised countries can play a decisive role in making them ore effective.   This is a challenge to britain to use her aid to the greatest possible effect.

CONFIDENTIALIV - BRITAIN&apos;S CAPACITY TO HELP55.   The previous chapters have described the circumstances which ledBritain and a number of other developed countries to contribute substantially to the flow of resources to the developing countries.   a stable X shows, Britain has responded to the need with a mounting programmeof capital aid and technical assistance;    we have contributed money, goods and skilled manpower.   Our total expenditure on all forms of official aid,before interest and capital repayments are deducted now represents about two-thirds of one per cent of the Gross National Product; of British privateinvestments in developing countries were included this would bring thetotal up to almost one per cent.   About a seventh of the total expenditureon bilateral official aid consists of technical assistance; this meant that at the end of 196*1- there were 13,000 British people serving overseas,the cost of whose services was being met wholly or partly from Britishfunds,56.   These results have been achieved in spite of the fact that since theend oi the second world War the British economy has experienced recurrentbalance of payments difficulties and has been growing internally less rapidly than the economies of most of the developed countries which give aid.   In1964- the overall external deficit amounted to almost  750 million, andalthough the measures taken by the Government have resulted in a majorimprovement in this position, in our present situation our capacity to provideaid is obviously limited.   Aid involves a sacrifice of resources on whichthere are a number of urgent rival claims.   It may mean less productive or social investment at home, or a slower rise in personal consumption.Moreover, vie have been less free than other donors to provide aid in formswhich minimise the burden on our balance of payments.   The impact on thebalance of payments is a particular constraint at the present time.   although a significant part of our aid is spent on British goods and services a partof it costs scarce foreign exchange,57.   Some kinds of aid &quot;involve a cost to the domestic economy significantlygreater than their cost in money.   For example, many of the types of goods/ requiredCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL&quot; -       5required by the recipients of our aid are produced by the engineering industries, whose products are of special importance both to domesticinvestment and as commercial exports, both of which are vital to our wholegrowth programme.   Similarly many of the personal skills most needed forthe technical assistance programme are of kinds of which Britain herselfis in great need;    such as those of agriculturalists, engineers, doctors,teachers, statisticians and economists.   This means that if we are tocontinue to play our part in overseas development we must plan our aidcarefully and make provision for it in our long-term national plan.58,   Ultimately, the amount of aid we provide will depend on our ownprospects of growth and on the amount of our total resources which we are willing to sacrifice.   In present circumstances; however, we must haveparticular regard to the impact cf the aid programme on our externalbalanco of payments.   These sacrifices have to be seen in perspective.The sacrifice of resources which the aid programme may involve is notgreat in relation to our wealth.   By the standards of developing countrieswe are rich, with an average income about ten times the average of theirs.Nevertheless it would be unrealistic to disregard the constraint at presentimposed on our aid programme by the balance of payments.590   All expenditure, whether by tne Government or by private individuals,costs some foreign exhenage, but aid may result not in the transfer ofBritish goods or services to the recipient country, but in the transfer of sterling to third countries.   This applies particularly to convertiblesterling provided to meet the local costs of development or, more generally,to finance budgetary expenditure as a whole since this provides the country concerned w:&apos; th foreign exchange which can be used to finance imports fromanywhere in the world.    It may apply to aid tied to the financing ofimports from this country unless there is a corresponding increase in thetotal of imports into the recipient country from Britain.    It applies evenin some degree to the emoluments of British experts who go out to less developed countries.   Nevertheless, there are compensating advantages, andthe total balance of payments cost   of aid is only part of its face value./ 60.confidential confidential

confidential confidential , Cj60.   Moreover, Britain&apos;s aid effort cannot be considered in isolation.The more we play our part, the more other countries may be encouraged to do the same.   Vie shall also benefit in the long run from the wholeprocess of economis development and the extension of international trade which will be possible if there is an adequate increase in the total flow of aid.6l.    These benefits, however, can only be assured if we can competeadequately in international trade.   The developing countries naturally wishto use aid to buy from the cheapest source, and may therefore wish to useaid from one donor to purchase from another.   This need only cause concern to a donor country if its exports are unable to hold their own in the third countries to which this aid might be diverted.62.    Since several major donor countries face balance of payments problems,there is a constant threat to the flow cf aid;   and the measures they take to protect their reserves, whether these are fiscal, monetary, commercial or in their aid programmes, may induce other countries to adopt similar measures.   The final outcome may be trade distortions and lower levels ofboth trade and aid than would otherwise be the case.63.   For these reasons we attach great importance to improvements in theinternational monetary system.   Any scheme for increasing intex-nationalliquidity will help to maintain the world level of demand, and from this the developing countries are bound to benefit.   The need to keep up thelevel of both trade and add adds urgency to international discussions ofthis problem.6h.   In the meantime, in the absence of international solutions and solong as our balance of payments problem is unsolved, Britain, like othercountries, ties a significant part of her aid to purchases from her ownexporters.   The tying cf aid often reduced its effective value to the recipient and the ideal solution would be a general untying by all donors.We are exploring in consultation with other donors ways in which the draw-backs of tied aid, from the point of view of the developing countries, canbe mitigated./ 65.   -confidential confidential

CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL65*   We are also discussing with the receiving countries ways in whichthe burden of our aid programme on our balance of payments could be reduced.Here again forward planning is the answer, as was recognized by theCommonwealth Prime Ministers at their conference last month.   Mostdeveloping countries have their long-term plans.   We shall seek to use our aid programme as a bridge between them and our own national five-year plan.   An expanding exchange of goods and services, related to andfurnished by the aid which we provide, will enable us to give the greatestmeasure of help to their development, while leading to benefits to ourown economy and to world trade generally.

&quot;V.     Role ef the Ministry of Overseas Development70.   When the Government took office in October 1964, ono of its first actswas to centralise the administration of aid in one department under a cabinet minister.     The value of co-ordinating our technical assistance work for alldeveloping countries was recognised by the setting up in I96I wf the Depart-ment of Technical Co-operation.     But responsibility for capital aid still remained dispersed among a number sf ether government departments.     Thishampered effective planning,for technical assistance and capital aid are merelytwo facets cf the same problem of development and should be closely linked.It also made the administration of our aid programme more difficult.71.   The creation of the new Ministry was a recognition of the challenge withwhich Britain and other industrialised conintries are faced by the poverty of most of the world&apos;s inhabitants.     The concentration of responsibility inthe hands of one Minister enables us to work out a coherent aid policy andto adapt the distribution of our aid to that philosoijhy.72.     The central purpose of the new Ministry is to formulate and carry outBritish policies to help the economic development of the poorer countries.To this end the Ministry has assumed responsibility for the economic aid programme as a v/hole and its detailed composition;    the terms and conditionsof aid;   the size and nature of the programme for each country;    the manage-ment of financial aid and technical assistance;   relations with internationalaid organisations;    the British interest in United Nations programmes of technical assistance;   and relations with voluntary bodies concerned withaid and development.     The only exceptions to this are that budgetary, butnot development, aid to dependent territories is still the responsibility ofthe Colonial Office which works in close touch with the Ministry in this;and that the Treasury will continue to deal with the International Bank for reconstruction and Development in co-operation with the Ministry.     TheMinistry is not responsible for military aid, which remains under theForeign Off ice, Commonwealth Relations Office ana Colonial Office.73*     The now structure has strengthened our aid work in various ways.Studies are being undertaken of the economic problems of development in/generalCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

general and those of particular regions and countries.     New ideas andtechniques for the management of aid are being evolved.     Steps are beingtaken to plan our effort ahead in coordination with the plans of developing countries.     Economic missions are being sent to several countries to help them to draw up those plans.74&apos;     Closer contact has also been established with the countries to whom wegive help through the strengthening of the Ministry&apos;s representation overseas.New posts have been created in H.M.G.&apos;s. overseas missions in order to enablethem to discharge the development side of their work more effectively andthis process is continuing.     In order to encourage regional planning and thebest use of scarce experts, the Ministry is establishing new regional develop-ment divisions on the lines of the Middle East Developnen4&quot; Division which has done such excellent work.     The first of these new divisions which has been set up in the Caribbean will be responsible primarily for promoting thedevelopment of Britain&apos;s dependent territories in that area but the help ofits expert term will be available to other countries on request.75&apos;   Cuf a-id programme must Tae administered in harmony with the policies ofall the departments concerned with our economic and overseas affairs.     Inthe months since its foundation the Ministry&apos;s staff has been built up ivytransfers from those departments, by the absorption of the former Departmentof Technical Co-operation (including its specialist advisers) and by the recruitment of an Economic Planning Staff whose work is central to theMinistry&apos;s purpose.     The present organisation of the Ministry i3 described in Appendix A./VI -

VI   -   the  EXISTING PROGRAMME76.     Aid programme, if they are to be effective, cannot be switched on andoff from year to year.     They involve long-term commitments for several years ahead.     In planning future aid policies, therefore, we must take account of what has gone before.77*     The British government took its first steps in this field as long agoas 1929 when the original Colonial Development Act was passed.     Since thewar, in company with other leading industrial nations, we have devotedincreasing attention to the problem of overseas development.     In the lastfourteen years we have trebled our aid to a total of  190 million in 1964&apos;During this period certain patterns of distribution have emerged whichare described below.     A statistical summary of our currert programme isin Appendix B.78.   Th^ Commonwealth and colonies by far the greater part of the aid programme derives from our responsibilities for the economic development of our dependent territories and, after their independence, from our joint decision with their governments to continue that help, although in a different form.     In 1964/65 commonwealth countries and territories received some 87$ of our bilateral financial aid.The share of the remaining Colonies, which now contain only a small fraction of the total population of the developing Commonwealth, might at first sightappear disproportionately large, but the obligation to give them development and, whore necessary, budgetary aid is immediate and direct.     Since Britainexercises sovereignty,it is not to be expected that other countries will normally feel it incumbent upon them to assist these territories.     Aid tothe Colonies other than technical assistance is broadly of two kinds:   grants and loans under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts (which are enactedat 4-or-5-yearly intervals), and, for some dependencies, budgetary aid.79.   When a colony has attained independence our obligation changes its nature, formal responsibility ceases, but we have recognised its continuingneeds by offering aid in appropriate forms usually as part of anindependence settlements

CONFIDENTIALAlmost all have received help towards their development; must havereceived it for special purposes connected with the transition to independence- some have continued, for the timebeing, to receive budgetaryaid.

60.   Most of the rest of our aid to the under-developed Commonwealth goesto the Indian sub-continent;   this has had a different history.     Thesecountries received no aid from us in the early years of their independence;it began on a small scale with the inauguration of the Colombo Plan in 1950,but its main growth has been since 1958.     In that year the decline in theresources of India and Pakistan available for financing their development programmes gave rise to a large international aid effort in which we have played our full part.     These two countries received about 27$ of all british bilateral financial aid in 1964/65.81.   Other countriesForeign countries receive only a relatively small share of our present financial aid.     The origins of this part of the programme lay in our closehistorical connexion with the countries concerned, Taut in the past few years,as the idea of aid as a combined effort by the West began to prevail, our aid to foreign countries has increased, and has been provided to a larger number of countries.82.   Technical AssistanceBilateral Technical Assistance for all developing countries has been administered by a single department since I96I and covers the supply of skilled men and women;   help in education, training, research and other services;    surveys and feasibility studies.     Our expenditure in 1964/65was nearly 15% of our total bilateral programme.     The manpower and services provided under our technical assistance programme are quite as essential to economic development as financial aid.83.   Multilateral AidOur expenditure on multilateral aid - 10fo of the total Britishprogramme in I964/5 - is the most concrete recognition of the fact thatour own aid programme is part of a great international movement to promote the development of the non-industrialised countries.     The specialised agencies of the United Nations which we support in this part of our programme include the Food and Agriculture Organisation and U.N.E.S.CO.,on?relations with which are described in Chapter X; the U.^. Relief and/Works

Works Agency, which has inherited the care of the refugees in Palestine;the World Food Programme; the U.N. Children&apos;s Fund; and the ExpandedProgramme of Technical Assistance and Special Fund.   The last two hodiesare now managed in one organisation and provide advisers for small projects and pre-investment studies:; we play the leading part in supplying experts to them.   The largest single part of our multilateral aid, however, is oursubscription to the International Development Association (See Chapter III);and we also support the development of the Indus Basin and development banksfounded by countries in particular regions acting in concert84.   Commonwealth Development CorporationSince its foundation in 1948 the Commonwealth Development Corporationhas undertaken a wide range of projects, and invested in many enterprises,in the colonies and the independent Commonwealth      It must pay its waytaking one year with another, but may borrow from the Exchequer the great part of its needs of long- and medium-term capital.     In 1964/65 theCorporation1s drawings from the Exchequer were 66 million, at the end of1964 its total capital liability to the Exchequer was  88 million.85.   Forms of AidIn the latest period for which figures are available, the financialyear 1964/65,  57 million of our bilateral aid aas in direct support ofdevelopment projects,     million for budgetary subventions,  17 million for general development aid,  27 million for technical assistance and  51million for other kinds of aid.     Deta.ils are given in Appendix B      Theadministration of economic aid was shared between the Colonial, commonwealth relations and Foreign Offices, the Treasury, the Department of technical co-operation and the Export Credits Guarantee Department.86. the programme already in being has developed over a period of years, andthe formal commitments, implied obligations and existing policies of which itis the expression will generate large expenditure in the. years immediately ahead. We could not, even if we wanted to, abruptly change the present courswithout disturbing the economic development of those countries whose planning for the future has reasonably assumed help from Britain in at least the samemeasure, and in much the same forms, as in the past. The objectives and thefuture lines of policy which are described in Chapters I and VII will give/rise

in the years ahead to changes in the geographical and functional distributionof aid;    these changes must be related both to the needs of the developing countries and to this country1s part in international aid giving, neither ofwhich we be static.

VII - LINES OF FUTURE POLICY87.    As we have seen, the needs of the developing countries for aid aregreat; the problem of world poverty can be tackled effectively only by a combined effort by all the industrialised countries and international organisations working with the developing countries to raise standards ofliving.   For Britain this means that we must make clear, through discussionwith the countries that give aid and those that receive it, individually and in international organisations, the place of our own aid in the commoneffort.   In this paper as the preface explains, we do not specify theamounts of aid which we propose to provide in any particular period;we cannot do this at a time when the national plan is still underpreparation.   But we deal in this Chapter and those that follow with our policy towards developing and other donor countries and international organisations; with the terms of aid; with private investment and theCommonwealth Development Corporation; with the management of aid; andwith new initiatives in technical assistance./Paras. 88 and 8$ omitted/&apos;Forward Planning90.   We shall need to plan our aid with great care.   In the immediatefuture the shape of our programme will be largely determined by existing commitments, but as time goes by our ability to modify it will increasepiogressively as new decisions have to be taken.   We shall aim todevelop a long-term strategy for our aid, so that we do not simplyreact to past decisions and the pressures of the moment.   Our mainguiding principle will be to channel our aid in directions in which itwill make the most effective contribution to development.   This principlewill affect the division of our programme between multilateral andbilateral aid and the distribution of our bilateral aid./9l.

Share of the International Agencies91 *   The multilateral administration of aid carries many advantages.Both industrialised and developing countries have special confidence inthe experience and objectivity of the multilateral agencies.   The size ofour contributions must be in scale with those of other donors, and must befixed with due regard to our resources and theirs.   It will be theGovernment&apos;s aim to increase the proportion of our aid devoted to the multilateral institutions, including those concerned with technical assistance.Regional Co-operation92.   International agencies can play a particularly valuable part in encouraging regional co-operation.   Development programmes involving morethan one country are still in their early stages, but the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank and the African Development Bank are examples of promisinginstruments of co-operation between the developing countries themselves and with donor countries inside and outside the region.   Co-operationbetween neighbouring countries for the general benefit of a region isvaluable, not only for raising living standards, but also for promoting the general progress and harmony of the countries concerned.   The BritishGovernment will support the international agencies and the economic commission of the United Nations in promoting regional planning for development.Co-ordination between donors93*   If we ask receiving countries to co-operate with each other, wedonor countries must clearly be prepared to do the same.   Competitivenational aid programmes which pay little regard to the overalldevelopment needs of the receiving country can do more harm than good.Co-operation with other donors at present takes many forms and covers boththe discussion of general policy and its application in particular countries.Aid policy is discussed between the fourteen members of the Development/Assistance

Assistance Committee of the O.E.C.D. in Paris.   The D.A.C. holds at least one high-level meeting a year, at which Ministers responsible for aid anddevelopment are able to discuss the more important problems.   TheInternational Bank, apart from financing development projects in individualoountries, has established a number of consortia and consultative groupsthrough which donor countries are able to discuss and plan the aid they give with representatives of the receiving governments.   The India and pakistan Consortia are the most notable examples.Sh-.   British Ministers and officials meet from time to time with their colleagues from other donor countries to discuss common problems.   Sincethe setting-up of the Ministry, such meetings have been held with theUnited States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy.   In the developing countries themselves British Embassies and High Commissionskeep in close touch with their opposite numbers from other donor countries and with representatives of the U.N. Technical Assistance Board and SpecialFund, the International Bank and other international agencies.   Co-operationbetween donors is still in its formative stage and much further effortneeds to be directed to it.   Its importance is clear if aid is to betreated as it must be, as part of a great international effort.Technical Assistance95-   In our aid programme we shall give the highest priority to technical assistance, which is not only in itself a vital contribution to all formsof development but is often a precondition of a successful programme offinancial aid.   vVe now have the administrative structure needed to ensurethat the two types of aid complement each other as much as possible a   Theplace of technical assistance in the management of aid, and the newinitiatives in technical assistance which we are now undertaking, arcdescribed in Chapters IX, X, XI and XII.Bilatej^aj^Finanoial Aid96.   Aid on a bilateral basis will remain the largest part of our programme,/in

in terms both of the absolute amount of our expenditure and of the resourcesdevoted to it.   The ultimate interests of the developing countries, andour own resolve to see that our outlay brings results in development and rising standards of living, demand that we should take individual decisions on the basis of the principles described in Chapter I.97-   The application of these general policies to particular countries will,of course, take time to work out, and much will depend on the development plans and proposals of the countries concerned.   Meanwhile, althoughcountries exist both inside and outside the Commonwealth with capacity for development and with governments determined to pursue it, the greater partof our aid may be expected to go to Commonwealth countries, whosehistorical and political ties with us are strong.   V,e shall continue to havea specie! responsibility for aid to our dependencies.   We shall hope toincrease our aid to foreign countries.

CpOTJPjjNTJALVIII - The Terms ofjlid98.     A substantial part of our aid, like that of many other donors isprovided in form of grants.     Until recently grants amounted to nearly half of our total programme, they included budgetry and much of thedevelopment aid to Colonial territories and subscriptions to theUnited Nations development bodies, the Expended Programme for technical assistance and the Special Fund.     The proportion is now beginning to fall, since there are fewer dependent territories and the expansion ofour aid programme mainly takes the form of development loans.99-     All donor countries provide a significant part of their aid inloans and here the problem of terms is crucial.     It has gradually cometo be recognised that many developing countries cannot pay interest at market rates, repay capital and at the same time maintain an adequaterate of development.     They are faced with an increasing burden of debt,which pre-empts a larger and larger amount of their earnings of foreign exchange.     This problem has been under study in the DevelopmentA assistance Committee of the O.E.C.D. for a number of years;     greatemphasis was placed on it at the United Nations Conference in Trade andDevelopment in Geneva, where it was agreed without dissent to recommendthat, in establishing repayment terms and interest rates, the overallrepayment capacity of the borrowing country should be taken into account.100.   The terms of the development loans provided by Britain have beenprogressively softened over the last few years.     Since 1958 thematurity period has lengthened from an average of 15 years to between20 and 25 years, and the previous Government announced its readiness in suitable cases to extend the period for as long as 30 years.     Grnoaperiods on the repayment of capital have been granted, on a wideningscale for periods extending up to the first 7 years of the life of theloan.     In 19^3 the Government introduced a new concession;   the grant to countries whose position justified it of waivers of interest for/periods

CjOjmiwriiiLperiods up to the first 7 years of the life of loans.     This has hadthe effect in some oases of reducing the effcotive rate of interest pay-able over the life of a loan by about one third of the normal rate, whichis based on the rate at which the Government itself can borrow plus asmall management charge.101,     The Government believes that the time has come for a new initiative and that we should not be inhibited by our present difficulties fromtalcing it.     Useful though the waivers have proved, they do not fullymeet the difficulties of the most needy countries, and there is littlepoint in lending more to meet debt service on old loan.    We have there-fore studied in greater detail the problems invslved.     The terms cf aidnormally comprise three main elements:   the rate of interest (including any waiver which may be given);   the period of maturity of the loan;   andany grace period which may be allowed before the repayment of capitalbegins.     (The effect of these may be measured together by the technique of discounted cash flow to show the element of grant in any loan).Account must also be taken of any management charge:   we have decided to abolish the charge of 3$ which we at present impose.    We do not considerthe maturity periods of our loans unreasonably short, though we reoognieethat other donor countries and the International Development Associationgo further in this respect.     The two main improvements which we think necessary are to increase the giant element (i.e. to make our termsgenerally more generous) and, in doing so, to lessen the impaco of debtservice which racy moke itself felt when a waiver of interest and a graceperiod on the repayment of capital cones to an end.     We have therefore decided to make development loans free of interest in appropriate cases.This concession, oombined with suitable arrangements for the repayment ofcapital, will give us greater freedom in the determination of terras and,in particular, will enable us to lighten the burden of debt service in themiddle and later years of the loan.     Countries which do not receiveinterest free loans may in appropriate cases receive waivers of. interest./102.   In offeringCONIIDMTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL102.     In offering these concessions we shall have regard to thefinancial and economic position of the recipient country concerned.We believe that this, rather than the nature of the project or other purpose of the loan, should be the decisive eoonomic criterion of theterms of aid.     We shall have regard particularly to the relativepoverty of the country, together with its balance of payments positionand prospects.     We shall also toko into account its efforts to mobilise resources for development and to use them effectively.1?3.     This new policy will involve little, if any, cost to our balanceof payments in the immediate future, since countries which receiveinterest-free loans would probably have received waivers of interestunder our previous policy.     In the longer term, however, it represents a considerable concession.CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALIX - The Management of Aid104*   If Britain contributes substantially to the flow of aid, she has theright to ask that the resources transferred shall be used to the best effect.We cannot realistically suppose that there will never be failures; newly-independent countries will some times, like the countries assisting them,make choices which prove to have been mistaken.     There are nevertheless manyways in which we can improve our management of British aid and reduce thepossibilities of waste.105. One of the Ministry&apos;s main purposes will bo to combine the planning and administration of British financial aid and technical assistance so as to use to the best advantage the capital and skills which we can contribute.   We shallaim to supplement the efforts of the developing countries and to give them themost effective support.   The first and most fundamental requirement for goodmanagement is clarity of objectives     Closely related to this is the questionof initiative in putting forward projects which might be suitable for Britishaid.   Until now this initiative has usually lain with the developing countryitself.   We intend, in future, to m*ke c more deliberate effort to select, inagreement with recipient country, field of activity or projects on which our aid should be concentrated.1-16&quot;. The keynote of our efforts will be partnership with the recipient countries.Together with them we shall be more active in identifying particular opportunities for providing aid which may assist or, indeed, generate development eitherwithin or across national boundaries.   In the close and continuous contactswhich we expect to have with the governments concerned, we believe that(although the choice must lie with them) they will give due weight to theviews which we express on the value of particular sohenes, and on the balanceof financial aid and technical assistance needed for their planning and execution.107. The organisation of the Ministry which has been referred to in Chapter Vis be:UiG ohap&amp;d so as to enable it to discharge these responsibilities.   we intend to make closer studies of the economies and needs of the recipientcountries and of the use 61 wi-r./108.CONFIDENTIAL

New,Initiatives in,Technical Assistance; Recruitment and voluntary Service &quot; &quot;109. Since its formation the Ministry has &quot;been engaged en a systematic review of all. its operations in the field cftechnical assistance.   In this the Ministry has not only drawn on the experience af the Department of Technical qo-pperatiea,Isut has worked closely with other Government Departments andmany organisations and individuals outside Government.. TheMinistry warmly appreciates the help and interest which it hashad from all of these.   A technical assistance programme, to hesuccessful, must make the fullest use of available resourcesnot only inside the Government, hut also in universities,technical colleges, research institutes, statutory corporations,employers&apos; associations, trade unions, the co-operative movement,local government &quot;bodies and voluntary societies.   To he effectivetechnical assistance must he a transfer of know-how from countryto country, not simply from government to government.110, As a result of this review, a number of new decisions havebeen made by the Government in the field of technical assistance and a number of new initiatives are new to be undertaken.   Theseconcern the management of aid, the subject of Chapter IX, aswell as recruitment; voluntary service; economic planning;natural resources; education; training, including administrative and industrial training; medicine and health; and populationcontrol.   These initiatives are described in this Chapter andthe two which follow.    Together they represent a major effort by the Ministry.The Supply of Skilled Manpower:    Developing countries continueto need and to ask for professional, technical and administrative staff from Britain to help push forward their development.   the organised provision of skilled manpower for this purpose istherefore a vital element in Britain&apos;s aid to developing countries and is a prime function of the Ministry,CONFIDENTIAL / Some

confidentialCONFIDENTIAL112. Seme of the newest independent countries, particularlyin Africa, continue to need professional and technical staffin large numbers to help man their services and in teaching and training of all kinds.   But increasingly theirrequirement - like that of countries further advanced onthe road of development in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere -is for highly specialised staff to advise and help governmentsof developing countries on particular problems and projects.Britain provides these experts under its own &quot;bilateraltechnical assistance programmes and under those of theUnited Nations and its specialised agencies.113. Intense efforts &quot;by the former Department of Technical-operation achieved some striking success and the annual rate if appointments made, which more than doubled &quot;between1961 and 196k from 900 to nearly 2,000, continues to rise.But the demands by overseas governments for new British staffincreased still faster as newly independent governmentsexpanded their services and the number of career british officers decreased! and the rate of demand has continuedto rise since the establishment of the Ministry.    The largestrequirement is in teaching, but there are important demands in other professions, including medicine, agriculture and engineering.11h. A thorough review of recruitment policy has been undertaken by the Ministry since its establishment.   Theorganisation for recruiting professional staff has been strengthened with the establishment of a Division of theMinistry, with four Departments, wholly concerned with overseas appointments.   Advertising has been improved;contacts have been developed with professional bodies; andmore systematic arrangements have been, made for keeping intouch with qualified people in Britain who are interestedin service overseas.   Financial help towards the cost of confidential /appointments

CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALi! &apos;appointments in overseas countries is already provided underthe Overseas Service Aid Scheme, under the RegionalProgrammes of technical assistance and under the CommonwealthEducation Plan.   But the review has shown that more needs tobe done to &quot;build up the sources of supply of the skilledpeople required.115.   We should like to soeit widely accepted in chis country thata pref essiona^. career should normally induce a period ofwork overseas in a developing country.   To this end, we musthave means of providing staff for service overseas which take account of the needs of overseas governments and those ofthe men and women concerned in Britain and pf their parentemployers here.   Those who go abroad must feel sure that theycan resume their former employment without prejudicing their home careers an  without less of pension rights.   For theBritish employer, in present conditions cf full employment,the release of an employee to serve for a time overseasrepresents a real sacrifice; and although employers generallyhave cc-operated in this work, their ability to do so ishandicapped in many cases by their own staff shortages.   Theccnclutien the Government has reached, therefore, is that infields of recruitment where it is important to ensure thatBritish help is given, the home establishments of governmentdepartments and public bodies should be strengthened so asto make it possible to release people more readily.116. The Home Base.    In some professions, notably teachingat the secondary level, existing arrangements work well and no new measures are needed, only intensification of presentefforts.     But where specialist staff is required for key poststhe supply can be ensured only by creating additional capacity in home establishments.   A detailed examination profession by/professionCONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALprofession has been carried out in the Ministry and the resultshave been discussed with other Government Departments and theUniversity Grants Committee.     ^hese discussions have shown thatthere is scope for strengthening certain establishments on a substantial scale and that the organisations concerned are willing to co-operate inthis.     A total of at least 400 posts will be added for this purpose to home establishments in Government Departments, universities,technical colleges, etc.     It will clearly take time to build up newqualified staffs to this level.     But the aim will be to build up thenumbers to at least 400 in two to three years, and the fullest use willbe made of those who have already had experience overseas, as well&apos;,as of young men and women with suitable qualifications.     The professionswhich we aim to provide for in this way include agriculture, forestry,animal health, economics, statistics, educational administration, law,public administration, engineering, architecture, town planning, landsurvey and geology.Corps of Socialists.     There are some specialists who oughtpreferably to be in the direct employment of the Ministry itself,either because they have special knowledge of tropical conditions, or because they are working in a key area of development, or &quot;leecause noother suitable home base is available.     For this a Corps *f Specialistswill be established.     Its members will be offered continuing service with the Ministry, on the understanding that they will normally be lentto governments or other authorities overseas, either as theirtemporary employees under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme, or asemployees of the Ministry in technical assistance, or as employees ofinternational agencies.     We aim to include in the corps economists,statisticians, administrators, financial specialists and various experts in natural resources.     Administrators are particularly required for service in the remaining dependencies where the difficulty of; /supplyingCONFIDENTIAL

Nsupplying such officers for key appointments is becoming acute.Others will work in British diplomatic posts abroad on aid managementor in Development Divisions.     The aim is to build up the Corps ofSpecialists to about 100 in 2 to 3 years.     The fullest use will again be made of those serving overseas in developing countries or who have soserved, and of young people of special promise and skill.118.   Overseas Service Pensions Fund.     It is important to safeguard the pension rights of those who undertake service overseas under theMinistry&apos;s programmes.     There are arrangements for this in the case of established Civil Servants and can be made for people from a wide range of professions where there are contributory pensions schemes.     But theyare lacking for a number of others who are appointed to serve overseason contract terms, and some who would like to serve overseas forextended periods are deterred from doing so by the absence of provisionfor superannuation.     Those appointed to the corps ^f specialists willsimilarly require superannuation provision.     We have therefore decidedto establisn an Overseas Service Pensions Fund, for-which members ofthe corps of specialists will be eligible on a voluntary contributory basis.     The introduction of this Fund should encourage more people toundertake service overseas for longer periods so that more use can bemade of the knowledge and experience they gain.119.   Extension o^jp^erse^as Servi^ Aid. Scheme.     The Overseas ServiceAid Scheme was brought into being under the Overseas Service Act of196l and agreements have been made with 41 governments andadministrations enabling satisfactory emoluments to be paid both totheir existing British staff and to new recruits.     Over 10,000men and women are now/servingcoroipjroiAL

CQN/r^NTIAjjserving abroad under this scheme,,   But the scheme hashitherto &quot;been confined to members of the central public services of overseas governments.    It is often a matterof historical chance whether in a particular country apublic service is performed by a government department or bysome other body such as a public corporation.   The work doneis of equal value to the community however it is organised.By no means all education is provided direct by the centralgovernment; much of it is organised by separate bodies suchas universities and technical colleges and much, for exampleprimary and secondary schools, is organised partly by government and paitly by voluntary bodies.   British staff arealso doing essential work in the service of local governmenthoodies and in research establishments, independent hospitals and broadcasting authorities.12*5. The Overseas Development and Service Bill now beforeParliament &apos; is intondod to give the Minister of overseas Development power to assist in meeting the cost ofBritish staff serving in a variety of public bodies engagedin work of social or public importance in the developing countries.   The scheme will not be extended automatically toall British employees serving under these bodies in thecountries concerned;  it will be applied to thos organisations and staff which are considered of key importance by overseas governments and the British Government.   We have made it clearthat these will include aniversities.    It will thus be pas sib:!to provide further necessary help both to retain and recruitqualified British staff needed for essential pbulic purposes ia number of developing countries.121. Service Overseas by Volunteers:    The programme cfservice overseas by graduate and qualified volunteers isoperated by four independent voluntary societies - VoluntaryCON^ID^TIAL /Service

CONfflDJflTTIALService Overseas, International Voluntary Service, theNational Union of Students and the United Nations Association -with substantial support from the Government.    It has grownrapidly every year since it was started in 1962 and willgrew still further in the volunteer recruiting year startingin September 1965.    The Governments support of the volunteerprogramme extends also to the cadet volunteers whom V.S.O.has beenssending overseas since 1958.   Two figures illustrate the increase in the Government&apos;s contribution;    in 1962/63the Governments expenditure on service overseas by volunteersincluding cadets, was about  28,000;  in the current financialyear it will be about  620,000.   The second figure covers75% of the costs incurred by the voluntary societies, and includes payment for the; work of the British Council overseason behalf of the voluntary bodies and their volunteers.122o At present there are about 900 volunteers overseas.In the autumn of this year the number wiTMrise to about 11+00;and next year to about 1800.    In the coming year the Governmentand the voluntary societies intend to strengthen the processof project selection.    For this purpose the Voluntary societieswill arrange for more frequent visits by their staffs to the developing countries to discuss at first hand the projects for which new volunteers are to be sent out and to evaluate the work which the present volunteers are doing.    Vherenecessary ihe voluntary societies will recruit extra staff for this; and the Governments support of the volunteerscheme will    include help towards meeting any extra expenditure which arises.   In the conning recruitment seasonthere will be fresh publicity measures, which will includethe showing in schools, univexsities, youth clubs, factoriesetc. of a film about the -work of the volunteers producedCON^TTT^TIAL Ay thein,

The organisations have now agreed to set upa permanent committee for this purpose,    ,vith a smallsecretariate which tic  Ministry will support by contributinghalf the cost.    The Ministry will &quot;be represented on theCommittee by an observer.    Mr. Leslie Farrer-Brown has beenappointed Chairman by the eight Societies.

XI - New Initiatives in Technical Assistance; the Economic Services124- Assistance in Economic Planning.   Incfeased assistance is being madeavailable to overseas countries in the planning of their development programmes.   This has been made possible by the establishment of theMinistry&apos;s Economic Planning Staff.   This type of assistance takes severalforms.    On request from overseas governments, we provide visiting teams tothe countries concerned, to assist in the preparation and carrying out of plans and to advise on priorities in development policy.   Teams of this sort are being sent this year to Tanzania, Malawi and the Southern african territories.    (Mention may also be possible here of the join Mission to the carribbean, if it has been agreed and announced in time.)Secondly, we are supplying more economists and statisticians for periods of service overseas, directly attached to governments, and we hope to increase this number substantially, with the aid of recruitment overseasdescribed in Chapter X.   We are undertaking s survey of British universitiesto find out more about the number and type of economists interested in and available for work overseas.    In the longer term, the supply of speciallytrained people in this field will ba increased by the new Institute ofDevelopment Studies described in Chapter XII.125* Application of Science. Scientific investigation and the export andadaptation of advanced technologies is a specially valuable form of assistance we support and are seeking to expand a number of science-based units in britain - the Tropical Products Institute, the Anti-Locust Research centre and the Tropical Stored Products Centre - which is not only carry outinvestigations both at home and overseas, but aslo provide training and support for overseas workers,   In other cases the Ministry finances at british scientific stations special sections with overseas responsibilities- the tropical divisions of the   Road Research Laboratory and the BuildingResearch Station and the Overseas Unit of the National Institute ofAgricultural Engineering.   Assistance an Map. in is provided on a large/scale

scale by the Ministry1s Directorate of Overseas Surveys, which is alsodeveloping a land use section.   Help in the geological field is giventhrough the Overseas Geological Survey now integrated with the GeologicalSurvey and Museum of West Africa.   With the co-operation of the medical and Agricultural Research Councils, the Ministry also provides substantialdirect support to local research stations overseas, notably in East africa and the Caribbean, in the form of financial grants and help in theprovision of scientific staff.126. Agriculture. In developing countries agriculture and the land are themain livelihood of the people; Chapter II has shown that the pace at whichagricultural production is growing is dangerously slow.    Increased produot-ivity must be a feature of all development plans, but groat problems bothsocial and economic have to be faced and overcome to secure rapid modern-isation.   This therefore is a major field of assistance.   With a body of specialist advisers over the whole range of agricultural method, theMinistry is able to help in the framing of plans for agricultural develop-ment.and in the appraisal of such project3 for aid,127. In this task the Ministry is supported by a scries of specialistpanels drawing on the resources of experience and knowledge in tho country at large.   We cocognise   the contribution which the co-operative movementoverseas can make and here also the fullest support of the co-operative movement in Britain is mobilised through tho Minister1 a Advisory committee under tho chairmanship cf Lord Peddle, One of tho most effective instrumentsfor investment in agriculture is the Commonwealth Development Corporation,which can combine commercial knowledge and management experience with financial resources.   Close contact has been established with tho agriculutre-ural department of the International Bank of Reconstruction and development and with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the U&apos;..N.; continuingarrangements have been made with both bodies for active co-operation andexchanges of experience.   In this way we are taking a comprehensive viowof the possibilities of bilateral and multilateral aid designed to securehigher agricultural productivity.CONFIDENTIAL /l28

128. Communications.   Britain already has a long- tradition of providingtechnical assistance as well as capital aid to improve roads, railwaysand ports.   In the last twenty years there have bean spectacular advances in aviation as in communications generally.   With the: dovolop-nent of modern aircraft it is becoming more and more essential to maintain a high standard of ground services.   Advances in telecommunications,including satellite telecommunications, have .opened tho way to greatly improved services and the developing countries will wish to take advantageof them.   The Ministry is able to provide technical assistance in both these important fields, is supplying experts and can arrange training courses in this country.

XII - New Initiatives in Technical Assistance, Education,Training and Puplio Health129. Education.   The formation of the Ministry has made it possible tobring together all the main strands of educational aid provided by theBritish Government, so that the programme con be considered as a whole and given the maximum co-ordination.   The Ministry has its own advisory service,including a consultative panel, recruitment machinery for the supply of teachers overseas and an Education Division concerned with universities,   ..schools, technical education and teacher training as well as with theGovernment&apos;s relations with UNESCO and participation in CommonwealthEducational Co-operation.   V7e are in close and direct relationship with theInter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas,   the Council for technical Education and Training in Overseas Countries, and the national council for the Supply of Teachers Overseas;   and also with the CommonwealthEducation Liaison Committee and Unit and the UNESCO National Commission.130. We shall give further support to private agencies, foundations and voluntary societies, and are working in close harmony with the british council, whose contribution is cf major importance in,English languageteaching, the supply of teachers, the provision.of books, the developmentof public libraries and training and strident welfare.   We co-ordinate our efforts with the U.3. Agency for International Development and the largeAmerican foundations, the latest example being the successful conference on educational aid at Ditchley Park at the end of March.   We maintain a closeinterest in UNESCO, to which we are a major contributor and much of whoseprogramme is devoted to education in developing countries.131. Direct assistance by the Ministry covers a wide range.   A quarter ofour educational aid takes the form of capital assistance and we shall carryout the pledge given to the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers lastyear to increase the amount of our capital aid for higher education(university, technical and teacher training) in developing commonwealth countries and territories from the existing level of a little of  3 m. ayear to an average of  5 m. a year over the five years to 1970... . . CONFIDENTIAL /132.

confidential confidential &quot; 81132. In teacher supply we have set a target for the recruitment of up to1,000 non-university teachers in 1965.   Already nearly  2 m. a year is spent on teacher supply under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme alone;   theprovisions of new Overseas Development and Service Bill would enable us toincrease new recruitment and retain the services overseas of British staff employed otherwise than by Governments.   We also help on a large scale inthe training of staff to take over the higher and middle level posts inthe public services, including- posts concerned with education.   We plan to develop and strengthen this aid, and in particular to expand our teacher training work.   The Commonwealth Teacher Training Bursary Scheme has beenstepped up to $00 and will be raised to 550 next year,   This year about140 teachers from Britain will be flown to Commonwealth countries, mainly in Africa, to conduct intensive courses for serving teachers, all costsoutside the host country being met by the Ministry.133^ The new Study and Serve Overseas Scheme, announced and welcomes at theCommonwealth Education Conference at Ottawa talaat September will extend toother Commonwealth countries, and to faculties other than teaching, thesuccessful arrangements under which over 80 British graduates havo studiedfor diplomas on Education at the University College of Makerere beforeundertaking service as teachers in East Africa.   We shall continue on anincreased scale our support of the Centre for Educational Televison overseas and the Overseas Visual Aids Centie.    Je are starting pilot research projectsinto the use of television and programmed instruction as media for directteaching;   and into the use of the Ihsitial Teaching Alphabet.   A separateproject will be started on illiteracy; and a new initiative is projected tomeet the urgent demand for research in the field of curriculum development and examinations,134- Training.   The number of students and trainees brought to Britain underthe Ministry&apos;s programme continues to rise, from 1,500 in 1963 to 2,000 in1964 and a likely total of 2,500 in 1965.    Special courses are organised where necessary, notably a course in international law and legal drafting forGovernment legal officers, the only one of its kind in the world, which is of/special

confidential confidential &quot; gspecial interest to Commonwealth countries.   Other examples are courses inbroadcasting, television, urban studies now being discussed, and in manytechnologies.   During the Eastor vacation a study conference for Indian and pakistan postgraduate students was organised in co-operation with theImperial College of Science and Technology;   it was designed to relateresearch to practical problems of production and planning.135- The nature of the demand for particular types of training is alwayschanging, and it is essential that present facilities should be revised, andnew facilities created, in order to keep abreast of it.   This is particularly important in the fields of administrative and industrial training, whichrepresent two of the Ministry&apos;s priorities.136. A major initiative is being undertaken.   A new Institute of DevelopmentStudies is to be established.   The- idea of such an Institution was firstmooted in 1962 by the Committee of Training in Punlic Administration underthe Chairmanship of Lord Bridges, which recommended that it should be investigated by the Department of Technical Co-operation.   The idea, has since been extensively studied in consultation with the Council on Training in public Administration, which advised that Department and now advises theMinistry.   The Government has now decided to take immediate steps to set up this Institute.137- The Institute will fill several needs.   Its main function will bo toorganise courses of advanced study on the problems of overseas development in all aspects of economics, social studies and administration.   The courseswill cover modern theories of development, but will pay special attentionto the practical experience of developing countries.   Three types of people will be catered for;    senior administrators from overseas countries, especialthose working in or destined for senior places in planning offices andeconomic departments;   British graduates who want to specialise in problemsof overseas development; and British government officials who will be working on the problems of developing countries, whether at home or overseas.138. A small but highly qualified and experienced staff will conduct the courses and will also carry out research, so that the Institute may play a: : CONFIDENTIAL /leading

The Faculty of thisUniveroity, as well as experts from other universities, Government Depart-ments and private industry, will be drawn on to help the Institute on a part-time basis.   The Institute will be an autonomous body, with its ownGoverning Council, which will include members drawn from the Government andfrom other universities and institutions at home and overseas in addition tothe University of Sussex.140. The Institute will in no sanse supplant the activities in this fieldalready going on. in other universities in this country;   indeed its successwill depend on close co-operation with universities and other interested bodies, including the main international bodies concerned with development.-It   ill act as a clc :oia,-i h..&apos;:-&apos;-sc for research rav tr-ininc on development-problems, already being und^/t^kon in Britain and ?.s :\ centre ofdocumentation.

The Ministry will continue to support existing courses and relatedactivities in the field of public administration and development undertaken by British universities and other institutions;   these include the RoyalInstitute of Public Administration, a number,of British universities which provide special courses for overseas administrators and the- Institute ofLocal Government Studies at Birmingham University, which has already established valuable Commonwealth&quot; contacts, notably in India.   It will also/continue

confidentialCOHPIDEHDIAIi 84continue to provide assistance to institutes of administration in the developing countries themselves.   Thus help is already being given to theEast African. Staff Colleges and British staff are making importantcontributions in East, Central and West Africa.   A Public AdministrationSpecialist has been appointed to the staff of the Ministry and has visited the West Indies to examine possibilities for British aid.    Special help isbeing given to the   Government of Basutoland to establish training courses for its civil servants.142. The Ministry has arranged to provide a wider range of training facilities in Britain specially devised for students and trainees from southern and Central America.   For special reasons, largely connected withculture and language, the number of student coming to Britain under BritishGovernment schemes from these areas has hitherto boon small;   in 1963/64it was under 100, compared with rather more than 2,000 from Africa.   Inco-operation therefore with Latin American governments and with theOrganisation of American States the Ministry is making arrangements forseveral courses of training specially tailord to Latin American needss-(i)    a one-year course in Public Administration at the university of Manchester;(ii)    a five-month course, to be rim at the London School of Hygieneand Tropical Medicine, in the organisation and administrationof public health services;(iii)   a, three-month course at the Co-operative College at Loughboroughon the organisation and administration of retail co-operatives and(iv)    a. two to throe-month Study Tour for senior officials andtechnical assistance personnel concerned with town planning and urban renewal.143. Industrial training.

CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALCOHFinSHTIALI46. Population Control.   Ho help in population control was provided in theofficial aid programme before 1964;   the British Government merely passed on requests to the -appropriate voluntary organisation.   In that year,however, the Government announced that training in this country and theprovision of expert advice would bo made available in our technical assistance programme to those countries requesting it.   Recently theGovernment has taken a more positive line by encouraging the provision of expert assistance by the united Nations and by active participation in international Conferences which arc studying the various aspects of thosubject.   The Ministry has set up a Working Party including representativesof the Family Planning Association and the International Planned ParenthoodFederation and members drawn from universities who are specialists in various aspects of the population problem.   This has recently made recommendations for the improvement of training arrangements in Britain and for the improved supply of exports to developing countries.   A standing advisory body will be set up to carry on this important work.   Help in populationcontrol to those countries which want and need it is a policy that theGovernment intends to pursue vigorously in conjunction with otherindustrialised countries which are already engaged in this form of assistance

147.     Private enterprise can play an important part in assisting theprogress of the developing countries.     British firms have, in the past,provided not only capital but managerial and technical skills and know-howwhich otherwise would not have been available.     The combination of fundswith a team of skilled men, frequently with local experience, who candraw on the overhead facilities, and the international experience of aBritish firm, can bring great benefits to the economy of the host country.148,     This investment has been traditionally encouraged by the Britishgovernment;   our fiscal treatment of our overseas investment has, ingeneral, been generous.     Inspite of this there has been a marked declinein the flow of British private investment to the developing countries inrecent years.     Private investment, excluding portfolio investment and direct investment in oil, has fallen from  90 m. per annum in i960 and19d1 to  60 m. in 1962 end appears to have fallen further since.149.     -A.   number of obstacles stand in the way of greater participationprivate investment in the development process.     These arc partlypractical, arising from the difficulties of operating in countries withshortages of skilled manpower and basic utilities, a nd partly political.The political obstacles include the semctimes ambivalent attitudes of thegovernments of the developing countries and the resulting politicalrisk, faced by private firms.150.     Government aid is not, as has sometimes been suggested, a simplealternative to private investment.     It is more often complementary.     Itcan, for example, play an important part in helping to create the basicinvestment in transport, power/ on which industry can build, and without which private industry may hesitate to invest in the country concerned.The existence of such an infrastructure is, however, much less important than the feeling that the political climate is sympathetic to the inflowof private capital from overseas./151,   The improvementCONFIDENTIAL

confidentialCONFIDENTIAL151.     The improvement of this climate must be the result of co-co-operation.     Private enterprise can help (and is increasinglyhelping) to remove the fosva which newly-independent countriessometimes feel that their economies may como under the dominence offoreign capital, by training local staff to take an increasing share in managementfand by encouraging the participation of local capital.There may bo new forms of joihg enterprise, involving co-operationbetween British private enterprise and local entrepreneurs ordevelopment corporations, which should be developed   -and whichwe are considering/.152.     /^Incorporated in 151/7.153.     Our ability to support a substantial flow of private investmenttc the developing countries must obviously depend (like our ability toprovide aid) cn our ability to pay our- way.     We have been obliged, aspart of the measures to bring our balance of payments into betterorder, to modify in some respects the fiscal treatment of investmentoverseas, though these measures were not taken with particular reference to the less developed countries.     The Chancellor of theExchequer has made it clear that the Government docs not expect theeffect in these countries to be very great and will watch the situationclosely, 4 Certain con-cessions have been made to easo the position of the Comapnies duringthe transitional period.154.     Private enterprise has an important contribution to make in technical   assistance as well as financial aid.     Of particular valueare the resources, knowledge and skill provided by firms of professionalconsultants, of which there are many different types particularly inthe spheres of engineering and management.     It is the intention of theMinistry to make increasing use of this pool of resources, which mayoften provide the most efficient source for advice and investigation andfor the preparation of feasibility studies./155.

CONFIDENTIAL155.     A distinctive contribution is made by the Commonwealth Develop-mont Finance Company1s carefully chosen investments in the developing commonwealth countries, the value of which is warmly attested byoverseas governments and informed opinion in the countries concerned.I56.     The Commonwealth Development Corporation has a unique part toplay in development by pioneering new patterns of co-operation with local enterprise.     It engages in a wide variety of undertakingsincluding agriculture, fisheries, mining industry, public utilitiesand housing.     It   operates in association with a variety of partners -international organisations, governments, and commercial and industrialenterprises.     Its projects contribute in many ways to the devolopmciTCof developing countries both directly and indirectly through forexample agricultural demonstration and linked smallholder schemes.It has a staff of skilled and experienced experts who can manage projects;this is very valuable in some newly-independent countries where suchskills are in short supply.     It pays particular attention to the welfare of local people.     It can combine projects involving varying degrees ofrisk so that the one helps to carry the other.     It pan, in effect,provide for selected, projects the combination of financial help andtechnical management expertise which is ch?,racteristic of the best formsof private investment.157.     The Ministry attaches great importance to the Corporation work andlooks forward to steady development.     In order to strengthen the corporations financial position and help it to undertake a greatervariety of projects the Government has decided to waive the interest onselected projects during the seven year period when an investment isfructifying instead of merely postponing the interest as at present.This concession will apply in selected cases to those types of project in which the Corporation invests in the equity and to its borrowing for,among other purposes, agricultural schemes and local development companies.The Corporation has warmly welcomed this new arrangement.CONFIDENTIAL
