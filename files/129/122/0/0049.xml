HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 s GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 14910th November, 19&amp;5COPY NO.66CABINETRHODESIA:   GENERAL ENABLING BULLMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralFollowing discussion in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee the Prime Minister further discussed with me theprocedure for the making of statutory instruments under the GeneralEnabling  Bill, and we concluded that the balance of advantage lay inmaking them subject to negative, rather than affirmative, resolution.However, the Leader of the Opposition and Sir John Hob son, to whom we have shown the draft Bill (Annex A), have indicated strongly thatthey do not consider that the negative resolution procedure will provide sufficient opportunity for the consideration by Parliament cf the wide powers which may be taken in Orders in Council;   and that, unless theBill is amended in this respect, there will be strong opposition to theBill in Parliament.    In these circumstances, I think we shouldreconsider this question, about which  in any event there were dividedviews among Ministers.2.       Under the negative resolution procedure, statutory instrumentscan take effect as soon as they are made.    They must then be laidbefore Parliament, and may be prayed against by either House withinforty days thereafter.    Such prayers are infrequent.    Debates on themin the House of Commons are normally limited to 1^ hours, from10. 00 p. m. to 11. 30 p. m.    There need be no vote at the conclusion ofthe debate.3.       Under the affirmative resolution procedure,  statutory instruments are normally laid in draft before each House and cannotbe made (and thus cannot be put into effect) until both Houses have passed the necessary resolution approving them.     There is no  time limit on the debate;  I understand that the Chair does not normallyaccept a motion for the closure before the debate has run for about six hours.     Under this procedure it is, of course, always necessaryto proceed to a vote.4.       It is clearly essential that Orders in Council made under theBill should take effect as soon as they are made.    It may become necessary to make them on a day when the House is net sitting or itis not possible to provide the time necessary for the debates onaffirmative resolutions.    For these reasons the adoption of thenormal affirmative resolution procedure will not be practicable.But it would be possible to make use of a modified affirmative resolution procedure, under which the Orders will take effect assoon as they are made but will expire at the end of a specified period

A&apos; 9 eo &amp; li)(say, twenty-eight days) unless they are approved within that period by a resolution o  each House.     This procedure was originally adoptedin, for example, the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, and hasbeen used in a few more recent statutes.    The draft cf a suitableprovision is at Annex E.5,       The main advantage of the negative resolution procedure isthat Orders in Council made under the Bill will require a minimum ofparliamentary time.     Its disadvantage is that if this procedure is adopted the Opposition will, so it appears, oppose the passage of theBill and may also pray against each Order in both Houses of Parliament.At present seven or eight Orders are contemplated but of course asthe situation develops it may well be necessary to make more.6.       The advantage of the modified affirmative resolution procedure is that the Bill will have a much easier passage through Parliament,as it seems that the Opposition will be content with that procedure.Its disadvantage is that each of the Girders will require a separateresolution in each House, and there may in particular be pome diffi-culty in securing the passage of the resolutions in the Lords.    I under-stand that in that House Standing Orders require a Report from theSpecial Orders Committee before the resolution is passed, and itseems not improbable that some Opposition members of that house will prove obstructive.7.       There is no doubt that the powers v/e propose to take under theBill are wide and far-reaching, and fee way in which we propose toexercise them will not be apparent until the Orders in Council aremade.     Li such circumstances,   it might well prove difficult tojustify the exclusion from the Bill cf a procedure which would provideParliament with a full opportunity for debating the Orders.8.       I ask my colleagues to consider which procedure should beadopted.     On balance, I recommend the modified affirmative resolu-tion procedure as provided for in the draft at Annex 3.F.E.
