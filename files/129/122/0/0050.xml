C(65) 150 COPY NO.____6811th November, 1965CABINETEXCHANGE TELEGRAPH company memorandum by the President of the Boardof trade at its meeting on 4th November (C. C.(65) 57th Conclusions,Minute 6), the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the PostmasterGeneral -(i)  to enquire into the position which would obtain in the running ofParliamentary and general news services as a result of thewithdrawal of the Exchange Telegraph Company from these fields and of the indication that the Universal News Servicemight correspondingly expand their services;(ii) to consider in the light of these enquiries what, if any,Government action was required.2.       On the 5th November, I saw a deputation from the Printing andKindred Trades Federation and the National Society of Operative Printersand Assistants.    The deputation made it clear from the outset that they accepted the view that the closure of the Exchange Telegraph&apos;s Home and parliamentary Services was not an appropriate matter for reference tothe Monopolies Commission.    They also accepted that there was no case for the provision of public money for the continuation of these services.What they asked was that the Postmaster General and I should use our good offices informally to bring about some agreement between the ExchangeTelegraph Company (Extel) and its customers, the large newspapers, theB. B. C. and Independent    Television News (I. T. N, ).3.       I subsequently saw the Chairman of Extel, who explained to me the reason for the closure of these particular services.    Briefly, theyhave been earning for the Company a revenue of only  60,000 a yearagainst a requirement, if they were to be economic, of at least  160, 000.Not unnaturally, Extel has found that the newspapers, the 3. B. C. andI. T. N. have not been prepared to bridge this gap.    They can satisfactorilyobtain news by relying on the Press Association (which operates on a much larger scale and more cheaply) and on their own news-gathering resources.The Chairman of Extel explained that the decision to close these cerviceshad been taken reluctantly but the inevitability of it had been evident forsome time.4,      I enquired about the Universal News Service but found that thiswould in no sense be a substitute for the Extei services.    It operateswhat is tantamount to a public relations service on behalf of commercialcustomers and its proposed Parliamentary Service would be confined to industrial and trade matters.fHIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

CONFIDENTIAL -        g 3fc135.      I concluded that, in the light of the great difference between whatExtel needed to charge to make these services economic and what thecustomers were prepared to pay, there was no point in our seeing the newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, the B. B. C. or I. T.N.    We couldnot properly try to influence them to pay an increase of the order inquestion for a service they had decided they could do without.6.      I am satisfied that there is no issue of public detriment here.Extel has been supplying these particular news services only to the major national newspapers and five of the provincial newspapers, theB. B. C. and I. T. N.    The vast majority of local newspapers, and thewhole of the Thomson chain, have never been subscribers to them.There is no suggestion that the Press Association (which is itself owned by 120 provincial newspapers) issues biased news which could be harmfulto the public, and the customers can in any event supplement the PressAssociation^ service from their own resources.    Almost all those whowere using the Extel Service have alternative news-gathering services oftheir own, in addition to the Press Association.    No serious question of monopoly, therefore, arises.7. The Postmaster General, whom I consulted, agrees tha/fc no actionon his part is called for in the absence of any issue of public detriment.8.      I propose to announce in the House of Commons, in reply to a written Parliamentary Question, that I have made the further enquiries which I promised, in my answer on the 4th November, that I arn satisfiedthat the public interest is not in jeopardy, since adequate alternativefacilities arc available, and that as a result I am taking no further action.D. J.Board of Trade, S.W.1.10th November, 1965-2-
