THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1965C. (65) 128 Copy No.   6629th September, 1965CABINETPROPOSED ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT BETWEENNIGERIA AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMICCOMMUNITYNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsA difficult situation for us has arisen from Nigeria&apos;s negotiationswith the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) for an associationagreement. I attach a note for the information of my colleagues.2. My conclusion is that the Nigerian Government will not beprepared to withdraw their offer of preferences for the E.E.C., andI do not see what more we can do at present to deter them. We shallnot need to consider the question of retaliation unless and until it becomes clearer than at present that an agreement will be broughtinto force; this is likely to be some way ahead. Meanwhile thesituation may change to our advantage either as a result of thepresent dispute within the E.E.C. or for some other reason. But Ipropose to continue to keep a close watch on developments.A. G. B.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,24th September, 1965.6152a
PROPOSED ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT BETWEENNIGERIA AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMICCOMMUNITYThe problem1. Nigerian exports at present go in about equal proportionsto Britain, the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) and othercountries. But under the 1963 Yaounde Convention the E.E.C. grantstariff preferences to the Associated States mostly former FrenchAfrican territories and undertakes to grant complete free entry fortheir exports by 1969. Nigerian exports of cocoa, palm oil, groundnutoil and plywood face the full duty of 5-4 per cent, 9 per cent,10 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. These commodities representabout 25 per cent of Nigeria&apos;s exports to the E.E.C. Nigeria thusfears the eventual loss of a substantial part of her E.E.C. market to her competitors among the Associated States.The Nigerian solution2. The Nigerian Government have reached agreement inprinciple with the European Commission on an associationagreement under which they will grant preferences of between per cent and 10 per cent to the E.E.C. in Nigeria on 26 items.This is in return for quota and duty-free entry for all their exportsto the Six, except for the four products referred to in paragraph 1,on which they will get gradually increasing duty-free quotas basedon past trade. The arrangement would be described as a free trade area, although only 75 per cent of Nigeria&apos;s exports to the E.E.C.would enter duty free. &quot; Free entry &quot; would be nominally accorded to the E.E.C. in Nigeria by the device of designating existing customsduties as &quot; fiscal duties &quot;. Such an agreement would in the Nigerianview preserve her E.E.C. market, and at the same time give Nigeriaan opportunity to establish a better position with the E.E.C. andthe Associated States. It would be due for re-negotiation in 1969at the same time as the Yaounde Convention. With the present stateof disarray of the Community, however, it is likely to be some time before an agreement can be drawn up, signed, ratified and put intoforce.The difficulties for Britain3. The proposed agreement is objectionable on grounds of damage to our trade, precedent, and principle.(1) Damage to tradeSome  2-5 million (3^- per cent) of our exports to Nigeriawill be subject to the preferences in favour of the E.E.C. Inmost of the items we have only a small share of the trade.But on three items (parts of internal combustion engines, partsof machinery and &quot; other household equipment &quot;) we have the major share. The first two items were added under French
pressure. There is a risk that Nigeria may later be persuaded to increase the number of items and the margins of preference.(2) PrecedentIt will be the first time that a Commonwealth country has given preferences to a foreign country over Britain.(3) Principle(a) Nigeria enjoys free entry and some preferences in britain but has never given us preferences. If the nigerian Government grant preferences to theE.E.C. we shall bear the cost of their obtaining much less widespread advantages in the E.E.C. than they already enjoy in Britain for nothing.(b) It would be contrary to the view we have supportedin the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (U.N.C.T.A.D.) that developing countries should not be expected to grant newpreferences in return for concessions in the markets of developed countries.(c) It would not conform to Article XXIV of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) whichexempts free trade areas from the most-favoured-nation (m.f.n.) rule only if they cover &quot; substantiallyall the trade &quot; between two customs areas.Implications4.   If the agreement is put into force:(a) it would weaken the ties between Nigeria and Britain andwould strengthen the position of the E.E.C., andparticularly of France, in Nigeria;(b) other Commonwealth countries in Africa may follow suit.The East Africans are already negotiating with theCommission and Sierra Leone, Zambia and Trinidadhave shown an interest. The cumulative damage to our trade could be appreciable.(c) a drift away from the Commonwealth system into the E.E.C.orbit might be started;id) public opinion in Britain, and in particular exporters, wouldresent the continuance of free entry and preferences infavour of Nigeria or other countries which discriminatedagainst Britain in favour of the E.E.C., and might press for our aid or Commonwealth preferences in their favourto be reduced or ended;(e) developed countries which have supported moves in theG.A.T.T. and U.N.C.T.A.D. to give freer access tothe trade of developing countries without requiringadvantages for themselves in return would find itdifficult to continue to do so, if they found themselvesdiscriminated against in developing countries;CONFIDENTIAL6152 a 2
(/) competition would arise between developing countries for concessions from developed countries. Britain would beat a disadvantage vis-a-vis the United States and theE.E.C.(g) the G.A.T.T.&apos;s basic most-favoured-nation rule would be weakened with wide implications.Possibilities of preventing the agreement5. We cannot stop Nigeria, or any other independent commonwealth country, from making an agreement with theE.E.C. But at an early stage officials examined the possibility of theBritish Government making a constructive international offer suchas would make an agreement between Nigeria and the E.E.C.superfluous, or would at least generalise the negotiations. The ideasexamined included:(i) the extension by both Britain and the E.E.C. of Britishand E.E.C. preferences to developing countries generally;(ii) the elimination of tariffs by Britain and the E.E.C. on alltropical products;(iii) the parallel elimination of tariffs by Britain and the E.E.C.on a m.f.n basis on the most important exports fromNigeria and the Associated States.All these ideas were rejected as either contrary to the G.A.T.T., orobviously unacceptable to the E.E.C., or incompatible with our policy of support for the principle that new preferences should beextended on a non-discriminatory basis to all developing countries;or as being primarily of benefit to third country or Commonwealthexporters to the E.E.C. and without attraction to the AssociatedStates and therefore to the E.E.C.6. Consideration was also given to proposing that we should share the preferences offered to the E.E.C. by Nigeria. This, too, was rejected, because it would be regarded as a cynical reversal of ourdeclared policy towards the trade of developing countries; it wouldbe subject to the same objections in the G.A.T.T. as the proposed arrangement between Nigeria and the E.E.C.; and we should find ourselves in the impossible position of having to support theNigerians in rejecting similar claims from other countries whosem.f.n rights under the G.A.T.T. are the same as ours.Steps taken7. Since we could hardly remain silent and inactive, we hadno choice but to try to persuade the Nigerian Government not togo on with their offer of preferences to the E.E.C. The nigerian government were given an aide-memoire on 31 March, setting outin detail our objections. They were also warned orally that weshould be bound to oppose the agreement when it came before theG.A.T.T. In July an aide-memoire was left with the european commission, putting on record our objections, mainly onG.A.T.T. grounds.
8. The President of the Board of Trade and I hoped to discussthe matter with the Nigerian Prime Minister when he was inLondon in June, but he was unwilling to see us and asked that officials should meet. This they did, but we obtained nosatisfaction.9. The implications of the agreement could be so far-reachingthat I insisted on raising it with Sir Abubakar when I went toNigeria in August. Sir Alec Douglas-Home had spoken previouslyin March 1964 to Sir Abubakar about the Nigerian Governmentsreported intentions, before they began formal negotiations with theE.E.C. Commission. Sir Abubakar referred to this meeting and said that he wished to repeat the assurance he had given then thatno damage would be done to British interests. I went over our main objections with him. I welcomed his assurance, but made itclear to him that, if Nigeria&apos;s association with the E.E.C. were to damage our interest, we should feel free to take such remedial action as was necessary. He listened carefully, but at no stage indicated that the Nigerian Government might change their attitude; and he left me with the impression that there was no chance of theiraltering their decision to seek association with the E.E.C. I repeated the warning of possible remedial action at a Press conference before i left Lagos and to other Nigerian Ministers. The text of my remarksis annexed.10. We must expect questions in Parliament after the Recess,when I propose to take the same line.
AppendixTEXT OF STATEMENT MADE TO THE PRESS IN LAGOSBY Mr. ARTHUR BOTTOMLEY, SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS, ON20th AUGUST, 1965&quot; The Federal Government of Nigeria have kept the BritishGovernment informed on their discussions regarding the possibilityof Nigeria&apos;s association with the Community.The British Government recognise the right of the nigerian government to negotiate an association with the Community.Indeed, they would welcome arrangements to give Nigeria improvedopportunities in the European Economic Community market. TheBritish Government recognise that in their negotiations with theCommunity the Nigerian Government have sought to take accountof British trade interests. But in the course of the negotiations it hasbeen proposed that Nigeria should grant certain preferences to theCommunity.The British Government have pointed out that if theseproposals were to be implemented Nigeria would be paying theEuropean Economic Community at the expense of Britain for thesame type of advantages she has long enjoyed in Britain withoutaccording any reciprocal advantages to British trade.The British Government have therefore felt bound to informthe Nigerian Government that if they were to discriminate against british interests in this way the British Government might be obliged to reconsider the treatment of imports from Nigeria in theBritish market.The Commonwealth Secretary has had discussions on thismatter with the Prime Minister and with other Ministers in theFederal Government and has informed them of the views of theBritish Government.&quot;
