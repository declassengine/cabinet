RATES REBATES AND RATES BY INSTALMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Cabinet at their meeting on 5th August, (C. C. (65) 45thConclusions, Minute 4), authorised the preparation, in advance of ageneral measure of rating reform, of a short Bill to provide a measureof relief to ratepayers with low incomes.    It was understood that theBill would also provide for the payment of rates by instalments; itwould be a Great Britain measure.    7fe submit the following proposalsfor the approval of out colleagues.Relief to ratepayers with low incomes2.       The aim here would be to improve rates as a tax by reducing their impact on households with low incomes, rather than to relievehardship as such.    We have other plane for dealing with hardship, inparticular the Income Guarantee.    The purpose of rate rebates is tobring some immediate relief to the income groups which suffer mostfrom the regressive character of rating, while we consider our longterm proposals for making it a fairer tax;   and that is our justification for acting through rating authorities, not through the national assistance Board.3.       The scheme, which has been discussed with representatives ofthe local authority associations, is designed to take some account of income and family composition; to give a higher relief for a higher level of rates;  and to leave the rate poundage with some significancefor the beneficiaries of the scheme so that they do not lose their financial interest in local affairs.     On application to the ratingauthority - which would administer the scheme - a householder wouldbe entitled to relief if his rate liability exceeded  5 a year and hisvincome did not exceed  8 a week for a single person, or  10 a week for a married couple, with an extra 30/- for ea.ch dependent child;the relief would be two-thirds of the amount by which the ratesexceeded  5 a year.    There would be provision for marginal relief to prevent those just outside the scheme being worse off than thosejust within it.     Since relief would be confined to ratepayers, therewould be no assessment of household income, but it would be assumed that any non-dependant made a proportionate contribution to the rates.Thus, if the household consisted of the ratepayer, his wife and anothernon-dependant, the non-dependant would be assumed to pay one-thirdof the rates.     If the household consisted of man, wife, two children and one non-dependant, the non &quot;dependant would be assumed to payone-quarter of the rates.&quot;1 **is DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C, (65) 13212th October, 1965CABINET

4.       The scheme is admittedly crude, but so is the rating system;households with similar incomes may pay widely different amounts in rates.    The aim. has been to produce a scheme which is as simple to administer as possible.    Since it is a scheme to reduce the impact ofrates it does nothing for those who are not ratepayersj and because there is no assessment of household income a retired ratepayer whoha.s earning children living with him will come off better than ahousehold in which one of the children is the ratepayer and his parentsare living with him.    Such anomalies are inevitable but can be defended in what is an emergency relief measure designed to limit theharshness of rating pending long term reform.5.       Domestic ratepayers getting regular national assistance willcontinue to receive this rate relief from the Board and so be ineligiblefor rate rebates paid by the City Treasurer.     The Board and the localauthorities will need to work out liaison arrangements to avoid doubleclaims when people move in and out of national assistance.6.       The main claimants for relief - those on whom the rates bearmost hardly - are those who are above but not greatly above thenational assistance limits.    In some extreme ca.ses, where rate billsare high and households contain several dependent children,    somerelief may be obtained with incomes as high as   1, 000 a year (aboutthe average for industria.1 earnings).7.       The local authorities administering the scheme will not bekeen to do it.    It is a difficult jurisdiction, and it will cost money - insome areas a great deal, in all areas something.    Because theproportion of those needing assistance is likely,to vary widely fromone area to another, it is impossible to leave the cost of rebates to be financed by other ratepayers;   the more so as the latter may well belittle better off than those qualifying for assistance.    In our opinionan Exchequer grant of 75 per cent is the minimum which will make ascheme of this sort workable - the local authorities consider that theExchequer should meet the whole cost.    On the 75 per cent basis thecost to the Exchequer in the first year might be about  35 million,assuming everyone claimed.8.       Though we are reluctant to add to the complexities of the schemeit is for consideration whether we need provide for an appeal against a refusal to grant a rebate; while local authorities would have no dis-cretion in the matter, there is room for disagreement as to the relevant facts - the applicants income and his household circumstances.It v/ould obviously simplify the administration not to provide any appealand there is no obvious body to whom, an appeal might lie.    We shouldbe grateful for our collca.colleagues&apos; views on this.Payment of rates by instalments9.       We propose that domestic ratepayers should have the right topay by monthly instalments.    Half of all domestic ratepayers payweekly already through their landlord - private or local authority.This arrangement will stand.    But a right to pay weekly direct to thelocal authority would be administratively very expensive if it werepopular and we believe that the monthly provision will be adequate.-2-* .-3 4 ,q

10,     The local authorities in England and Wales have pointed outthat the new poundage is not known soon enough each year to get through all the work cf sending out notices of freshly calculatedinstalments in time for a first payment in April.    And they would want lvl?,rch to chase up the lagga.rds.    Go in practice monthly instalments in England and Wales will mean ten monthly payments and not twelve, which should be sufficient.11.     In Scotland rate poundages are not normally fixed until several months after the beginning of the financial year, and local authorities will have to be empowered, in any year, to fix provisional instalmentsfor the first months of the next.    In those circumstances twelve monthly instalments per year will be practicable in Scotland and there v/ould beno advantages in ton.12.     We therefore seek the approval of our colleagues to -(i)the proposals in this paper for a scheme of rate rebatesand a scheme for payment of rates by monthly instalments.(2)provision for an Exchequer grant of 75 per cent ofthe cost of rate rebates to the local authorities.W.R.D    U    O    fScottish Office, S.
