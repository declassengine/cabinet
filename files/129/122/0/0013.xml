The measures taken in the Budget to correct the balance ofpayments deficit are beginning to take effect.    This year&apos;s balance ofpayments deficit is likely to be well below/ half last year*s figure.    Toensure that we reach our aim of eliminating the deficit in the courseof next year and of maintaining the strength of sterling, the Governmenthave decided to adopt the following measures.A.     PUBLIC EXPENDITUREFirst, expenditure at home.    The Government intend to slowdown the rate of expenditure on capital projects and to defer as far aspossible purchases of equipment and stores by GovernmentDepartments, Local Authorities and nationalised industries.Housing, schools and hospitals will be contained within theirexisting programmes.    For other capital projects for which contracts have not yet been signed, the starting dates will be postponed for sixmonths.    Exemptions will be made for projects in development districts and other areas of above average unemployment.    Similarly,purchases of goods will be deferred to the maximum possible extent.All Government Departments have been instructed to carry out this policy and to arrange for other bodies for which they areresponsible to do likewise.    The nationalised industries will be called on to follow a similar course of action.    Local authorities will beasked to follow suit.Loan sanction will only be given to local authority projects which are urgently required.    In particular, sanction will not be givenexcept in special circumstances to loans for expenditure on civicbuildings, offices and a variety of miscellaneous projects which,though desirable in themselves, are not essential at this time.    Theexpenditure in these categories is now running at  150 million a year.Lending by local authorities on mortgage for house purchasehas trebled in England and Wales in the last five years, and in 1964-65reached  180 million.    This will be restricted to the average of thethree years ended 31st March, 1965, namely  130 million.Since the beginning of the financial year drawings by local-authorities on the Public Works Loans Board have been exceptionally heavy.    In present circumstances a more regular phasing of issues isnecessary, and I have asked the Public Works Loans commissioners to arrange this forthwith.The Government, in addition to reviewing their own establish-ments, are asking the local authorities to review their presentestablishments; and in the light of this to confine net increases in their staffs to very urgent services, where essential professional workers,e. g. teachers, are required.-1-

isoAs regards Defence, good progress is being made with the review designed to reduce the forward defence programme by some 500 million by 1969-70 and to achieve a large cut in that part whichfalls on the balance of payments.    Next year&apos;s programme is being reduced by  118 million below the planned figure.    As to other overseas expenditure, all Departments and public authorities are to observe the most stringent economy in overseas expenditure and do all they can to increase overseas receipts.So much for cuts in existing expenditure.    We shall also haveto defer some of the desirable social reforms we had hoped to do in theimmediate future.    We have decided that it will not be possibleto introduce an income guarantee scheme in the coming year.    first priority must go to wage-related unemployment and sickness benefits.We have also decided that for the time being we cannot remove any of the remaining National Health Service charges.We have also decided to postpone, for the time being, theintroduction of the scheme of specially favourable interest rates for owner-occupiers.B.      PRIVATE investment the Government will introduce legislation instituting a startingdate procedure for privately sponsored construction projects of thevalue of  100, 000 or more with the exception only of housing projects and industrial building.^ *The control will be made retrospective to all such projects forwhich no contracts have been entered into before the time of thisannounc em ent.Provision will be made for exempting projects in development districts and other areas with more than average unemployment.It is further proposed to introduce control over office develop-ment in the Birmingham conurbation.    An Order giving effect to thiswill be laid before Parliament as soon as possible after the Control of office and Industrial Development Bill receives the Royal Assent.As my Rt. Hon, Friend the President of the Board of Trade has already announced, closer control over industrial building will also beintroduced when this Bill becomes lav/.    It will become necessary inthe London and South Eastern,Midla.nds and Eastern Regions to obtain an industrial development certificate for industrial developmentexceeding 1,000 sq. ft.C.    HIRE FUR CHASEI have decided to reinforce the Hire Purchase measures.    Asfrom tomorrow the maximum repayment period of H. P. contractswill be reduced from 3 years to 30 months.    This will apply to all goods which are now subject to H. P. controls other than furniture,bedding, cookers and water heaters, for which the period will not be altered.-2-

B.    EXCHANGE CONTROLI propose to introduce some further changes in exchange control.    The first concerns direct investment outside the sterling area for which official exchange has been allowed on the ground thatit is specially favourable for the balance of payments.    For the timebeing no further approvals will be given for the use of officialexchange in such cases.    All approved projects will have to be financed with investment currency or by borrowing abroad.Another change concerns investment currency.    I   announced in the Budget that certain receipts of foreign currencies by residentsof the United Kingdom which had hitherto been allowed to be sold asinvestment currency would in future be exchanged at the official rate.The same change will now be made in respect of certain otherreceipts, including the proceeds of life policies and the assets of immigrants redesignated as residents of the United Kingdom.The next change relates to prepayment for imports.    Atpresent payment for imports into this country may be made at anytime between the date of contract and the date of arrival of the goods.In future payments will not normally be allowed before the goods havebeen shipped.    This should produce a useful once-for-all saving and help to check excessive purchases.Finally, I am asking the Bank of England to exercise moreuniform control over borrowing in this country by companiesregistered here but controlled by non-residents of the Sterling Area.If these exchange control changes are continued for a full year,the saving in official exchange should be at least  45 million over thenext year.E.    IMPORTSIt is the Governments policy to limit to the greatest possible extent facilities for financing imports of manufactured goods for home consumption and imports of all kinds for stock building.    With theGovernments approval, the Governor of the Bank of England has nowwritten a further letter to the banks.    It asks them to scrutinise witheven greater care than they do already all requests for credit when there is prima facie evidence that to provide the finance would facilitate payment for imports.F.    EXPORTSMy Rt. Hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade isintroducing from Monday next a further improvement in the E. C. G. D.bank guarantee facility, by reducing the qualifying contract value from 5 0,000 to  2.5,000.-3 -

TOP SECRET192Arrangements are also being made to reduce the cost of shorter-term credit.    This will affect a much larger volume of exports, and help many more companies.    For shorter-term credits of at least30 days and less than two years, guaranteed unconditionally byE. C. G. D. , the Banks have agreed in principle to make finance avail-able at Bank Rate.    This compares with rates of around i per cent above Bank -Rate at present.    The scheme will involve a largeextension of E. C. G. 0*3 unconditional Bank Guarantee facility.Details will be announced as soon as possible.G.    CONCLUSIONSThese measures taken together, will result in a further substantial improvement in our balance of payments.    Industry has its part to play.    The key to the situation is productivity and particularly the problem of over-manning.    We intend to identify particular ca.sesof restrictive practices on both sides of industry and take specificsteps to eliminate them.-4-
