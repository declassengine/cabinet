ARMED FORCES&apos; pay memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs and the Chancellor ofthe ExchequerUnder present arrangements for reviewing the pay of the armed Forces an increase in pay of the order of 18-V per cent andcosting over  50 million would fall due next April. We considerthat severe damage to our agreed policy for prices and incomes willensue unless this question is referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes for examination.2. The attached report by officials (Annex A) on the merits of such a reference was completed on 7th September, effectivelybefore it was decided that the economic situation made it essential,for a much more stringent application of prices and incomes policy,including the institution of an &quot; early warning system&quot; and theintroduction of legislation to provide the possibility of statutorybacking if voluntary arrangements did not succeed.3. The arrangements for biennial reviews of the pay of the armed Forces, loosely called the Grigg system, have been in forcesince 1960 and were designed to bring pay into line with civiliananalogues. They therefore have much in common with other &quot; faircomparison &quot; arrangements for determining the appropriate levels of pay in the public service. But all such arrangements tend to settle the pay of one group of staff at the cost of providing new arguments in favour of claims elsewhere. Since these arrangements wereinstituted, we have a new and agreed national policy for prices and incomes. Whatever is done about pay anywhere must take this agreed policy into account. And unless it is clearly being taken into account in settling the pay of the public services, the new policy is boundto fail.4. Later figures than those in the memorandum by officialssuggest that the current review would point to increases in service pay of some 18^ per cent with effect from 1st April, 1966, at a costof  52 million a year. We do not see how the Government wouldbe-able to argue with conviction that increases of this order were so obviously compatible with the agreed criteria of our White Paper6275aTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1695C. (65) 144 Copy No.      664th November, 1965CABINET
on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639) that they were justifiedin putting them into full effect. On the other hand, we do not see how the Government could decide, without any outside guidance,that only part of the increase shown by the formula should bepaid, or that it should be paid in stages. If it were argued thatthis had to be done because the economic situation did not permit the expenditure, we should be expected in fairness to take similardrastic action on a much wider front than this. If it were argued that it had to be done because the percentage increase was too large on incomes policy grounds, how could we find a basis for determing an alternative figure which would be accepted asconsistent with the White Paper ?5. This is just the kind of situation in which the guidanceof the National Board can be invaluable, because it is the agreedinstrument for applying the agreed criteria to individual cases inorder to determine whether the national interest is met.6. There is the argument that reference to the Board will taketoo long. We find this hard to accept because the increase in service pay is not due to start under present arrangements until 1st April,1966.7. We suggest therefore that we should refer to the national board both the question of the immediate increase in Service pay,on which they should be asked to report within two months (ifnecessary on an interim basis), and also the more general questionof the system of Service pay determination for which they could begiven a longer period.8. The terms of reference of the Board would need to bedrawn sufficiently widely for them to take account not only of incomes policy, but also of the recruiting needs of the Services andthe special features of Service life and emoluments. The board should be asked to apply the criteria of the White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy to this case, considering inter alia whether an exceptional increase in pay is justified by one or more of the various factors set out in paragraph 15, namely:(i) where the employees concerned, for example by acceptingmore exacting work or a major change in workingpractices, make a direct contribution towards increasing productivity in the particular firm or industry. Even insuch cases some of the benefit should accrue to thecommunity as a whole in the form of lower prices;(ii) where it is essential in the national interest to secure achange in the distribution of manpower (or to prevent a change which would otherwise take place) and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for thispurpose;(iii) where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levels are too low to maintain a reasonable standard of living;
(iv) where there is widespread recognition that the pay of acertain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.We should expect the Board to advise, with these criteria in mind,whether the Grigg increases should be applied in full next April or should be modified in some way, such as by application in stages orby confining large percentage increases to those points where theywould really help manpower difficulties.9. We are not impressed by the arguments in the paper by officials that these questions should not be referred to the national board because there would be major difficulties in presenting the relevant information about Service pay and because the delayimposed by a reference would make it impossible to take proper provision for Service pay in the 1966/67 Defence Estimates. We aresure that these are less serious difficulties than those we shouldexperience if we let the Grigg review take its course and then eitherapplied it willy nilly, or decided for ourselves by how much or in what way we should need to reduce it. If we refer the question tothe Board straightaway, we ought in any event to be able to have their guidance by the end of the year or very early in the New Year.Recommendation10. We therefore recommend that the Government shouldstraightaway refer to the National Board for Prices and Incomesfirst what increases should now be made in Service pay, and secondlywhat the arrangements for determining Service pay should be in the longer term. A draft of such a reference (Annex B) is attached.We propose that, in order to still speculation that has already arisenabout the Government^ intentions, an immediate announcement toParliament should be made of a decision to refer Armed Forces&apos;pay to the National Board.G.

Annex AARMED FORCES&apos; PAYThe present arrangements the arrangements for reviewing the pay of the Armed forces are based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on recruiting (The Grigg Committee) which reported in 1958. In brief,these arrangements, loosely called the Grigg system, provide forbiennial reviews to adjust the pay of officers to take account of movements in Civil Service Executive and Administrative Classsalaries and that of other ranks to reflect changes in the average earnings and wages in manufacturing and certain other industries.2. The last Grigg review led to the introduction of new ratesof pay on 1st April, 1964. Since the last review there have been substantial increases in the pay of the analogues used in the Griggsystem, and the current review may be expected to point to increases in Service pay of some 15 per cent to 20 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1966.3. The first Grigg increases took effect in 1960. The system isnow well understood by the Services. They have learned to accept that they cannot expect pay adjustments more than once every twoyears, but they rely on the biennial review to bring them into line with their civilian analogues. The arrangements have now assumed the nature of a long-term agreement. Indeed, this was an important consideration in the minds of Ministers in rejecting the proposedinterim pay increase for the Services. It follows that there is a strongmoral obligation on the Government to observe their side of thedeal and not to interrupt the Grigg system during a biennial cycle,the more so since the Services do not enjoy the advantage of thenormal processes of trade union representation and collective bargaining. Any failure to carry through the current review wouldbe regarded by the Armed Forces as a breach of faith, and theMinistry of Defence believe that the result on recruitment, morale andwillingness to serve might be very serious.Presentational difficulties4. The difficulty in present circumstances of justifying increases of 15 per cent to 20 per cent in Service pay will be considerable. Buta report from the National Board for Prices and Incomes, on a reference about the methods for determining pay, as distinct fromthe levels of pay, might not make the task of presentation any easier.The Board might well criticise aspects of the present arrangements and the result might be to make it more difficult, rather than less, tojustify the use of the present Grigg formula in the 1966 pay review.5. There is also a serious difficulty of timing in any reference of the Grigg arrangements to the National Board. Although the new rates of pay are not due to take effect before April 1966 they mustbe settled before the end of 1965 in order that proper provision maybe made in the 1966-67 Defence Estimates and the outcome published
with the annual Statement on Defence in February. For this reason the detailed work on the review is already well advanced. It would bevery difficult in the available time to arrange for the Board toexamine the Grigg system and to consider how any views it mightexpress could best be taken into account, particularly if the mass of detailed work involved in producing a new Pay Code had to be goneover again.6. Finally, the Grigg arrangements might be very awkward topresent adequately to the Board. Normally the interests of the employees can be represented by their trade union or correspondingbody. The Armed Forces, however, have no such organisation toput their case. In discussions on their pay within the government machine their interests are represented by the Ministry of Defence,but it is highly undesirable that conflicting evidence should be givento the National Board by the Ministry and the Treasury. On theother hand the Ministry of Defence could not accept that theServices&apos; case should go by default should it be decided to refer theGrigg arrangements to the Board.7. The problem of justifying large pay increases for theServices might be helped, however, if the Government, when the outcome of the current review is announced, could say that the increases were being granted in discharge of long-standingcommitments on Service pay, but that a full-scale review, taking intoaccount all the relevant factors, was being undertaken of thearrangements for determining Service pay in future. It would be forfurther consideration at the due time whether there would be advantage in referring whatever new arrangements might emerge tothe National Board before any final decisions were taken by theGovernment.Review of Grigg system8. There is much to be said, apart from the presentationaladvantages, for a review of the Grigg system. It is suggested thatthis review should be undertaken as a matter of some urgency by officials of the Ministry of Defence, Department of Economic Affairs,Ministry of Labour and Treasury under the following two heads:(a) The timing of increases and the form of future reviews;(b) The criteria for determining movements in pay.The timing of increases and the form of future reviews9. Fixed biennial reviews, on the present basis, suffer from twoweaknesses, which reflect the extent to which the present system isnow rather out of line with what happens in the public sectorgenerally.(a) The Grigg system is not designed to revalue pay but onlyto maintain its previous broad relationship with the pay of civil servants and with earnings in manufacturing andcertain other, industries.(b) But, in so far as the intention is to maintain a constantrelationship between Forces&apos; and other forms of pay,biennial reviews are too infrequent to achieve this.
Thus, the present system reflects, often in a particularlyembarrassing way, large increases that have taken place in civilianpay and earnings, as happened in 1962 and will happen again in1966. Moreover, in an occupation with a fairly rapid turnover ofstaff, to adjust pay at two-yearly intervals is not the best way ofmaintaining it consistently at a level that would most helprecruitment and particularly re-engagement.10. It is easier to point to the weaknesses of the present systemthan to define a new one which would not give rise to more problemsthan it would resolve. Any new arrangements would have to take into account the arrangements to succeed the current Civil service pay Agreement. One possibility which might be examined in thecourse of the proposed review might be to provide for relativelyfrequent interim adjustments, related to the norm, and relativelyinfrequent full-scale reviews, not necessarily at fixed intervals, whichwould ensure that Service pay did not lag behind if in fact otherincomes were increasing faster than the norm.11. On the other hand it cannot be overlooked that theServices set considerable store by the undertaking by theGovernment in November 1958 that Service pay would be reviewedregularly at intervals of not more than two years. To increase theperiod of review to coincide with arrangements for the review of administrative and executive class salaries might give rise to claims from the Services for the same provisions for retrospective increasesas were currently in operation for the Civil Service. This would clearly represent a major stumbling block.The criteria12. Any full scale review would need to take account of all relevant factors including (a) Incomes policy.(b) The ability of the Services to recruit and retain on a voluntary basis sufficient suitable men to meet their commitments.(6-) The relationship of Service emoluments to those of civilianoccupations with which the Services have to compete inattracting and retaining manpower.(d) The special features of Service life.Recommendations13.   It is recommended that:(a) In view of the strong moral obligation on the government not to interrupt the Grigg system during a biennial cycle,and the serious effect on recruitment and morale of anysuch action at this stage, the present Service pay review should be allowed to take its course;(b) The Grigg arrangements should not be referred to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes at this stage, since this might well intensify, rather than ease, the problemof presentation of the results of the review.
(c) Officials  of the Ministry of  Defence,  Department  ofEconomic Affairs and Treasury should be instructed toconsider what changes are needed in the currentarrangements for determining Service pay.(d) Further consideration should be given to a reference to theNational Board in the light of any new arrangements thatmay be recommended.Annex BARMED SERVICES&apos; PAYThe pay of the Armed Forces has been reviewed at two-yearly intervals since 1960. The next review is due to take effect on 1st April,1966.The formula at present used to determine the increases dueunder these reviews is set out in Cmnd. 945, dated February 1960,viz., &quot; It has been agreed that changes in the pay of Service officers will in future be governed broadly by the relative changes in the pay of comparable grades in the Home Civil Service &quot; i.e., the executive and Administrative grades: and &quot; It has been agreed that in futurechanges in the pay of ratings, soldiers and airmen will be governedbroadly by changes in the average earnings and wages in manufacturing and certain other industries as notified by theMinistry of Labour &quot;.The Government are concerned to establish whether this system can be regarded as in line with the considerations in Part I of theWhite Paper on Prices and Incomes (Cmnd. 2639). In particular, they wish the Board to consider, first, what increases, if necessary on an interim basis, should be made now or later in the pay of the armed forces, and, secondly, what the arrangements for determining the pay of the Armed Services should be in the longer term. The board are accordingly requested to examine and report on these issues.
