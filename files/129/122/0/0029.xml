THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1965C. (65) 129 Copy No.   664th October, 1965CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of power the First Secretary has proposed in a Minute to the PrimeMinister that coal prices should stay at their present level until 1st April, 1966, and that we should again review the situation &quot;ina few months&apos; time &quot;. I think we need to look carefully at thisproposal in the light of past events and present circumstances.2. Cabinet agreed on the 5th August (C.C. (65) 45thConclusions) that a final decision on coal prices should not be postponed beyond September. Pending a decision, I was asked toinform the National Coal Board that the Government would consider it inappropriate that any action should be taken in relationto a possible increase in coal prices. This was done. The coal board&apos;s proposal then before the Cabinet (C. (65) 110) was tointroduce price increases (already postponed from 1st April andsubsequently from 1st August) on the 1st September. This proposal would have produced  25 million of additional revenue in 1965-66,and  40 million a year thereafter, by:(i) selective additions to the pithead prices of industrial coalsdesigned to secure a better correlation between prices and the cost of production as between the variouscoalfields and the various coals; and(ii) additions to the zone delivered prices of domestic coalconcentrated on the more expensive grades of housecoal in short supply.3. In the meantime costs in the industry have continued toincrease and the financial position of the Board to deteriorate. Inthe five months to August 1965 a loss of  35 million has been incurred,  7 million more than in the original budget of 1965-66. Inthe same period last year the loss, on a comparable basis, was 18 million. On these figures the Board&apos;s July estimate of  25 million as the gap to be bridged (after allowing for capital reconstruction)may even prove to be too low.n6163
4. Lord Robens has told me, and I accept, that it is now too late in the year for a deficit in 1965-66 to be entirely eliminated byprice increases. To raise  25 million over four months instead of seven would require rates of increase that would be intolerable and,in relation to the Board&apos;s needs in later years, prove perhapsunnecessary. The gap between costs and prices will have to be financed initially by the Exchequer, and I am discussing with theChancellor of the Exchequer where the ultimate cost is to fall. i know that Lord Robens will seek to insist that the cost of the postponement, at the instance of the Government, should not be atthe expense of the coal industry or of their expectations under thecapital reconstruction already promised. Even if we were to take adecision to allow the Board to make the price increases it proposed,and even if these proposals were subjected only to the normal procedure of passing through the Consumers&apos; Councils, the increasescould hardly be operative before 1st December. There are, however,coal industry reasons for not increasing the price of house coal just before Christmas, or indeed during the winter. Increases then would come on top of the normal seasonal increases at a time of highestdemand and strong public reaction would be inevitable. For thisreason, and in view of prices and incomes policy, I agree that theincrease in house coal prices should be deferred until 1st April, 1966.These seasonal arguments, however, do not apply to industrial coal prices which ought, in my view, to be increased as soon as practicable.On the other hand, proposals for both industrial and house coalincreases ought to be announced at about the same time: otherwisewe will have no adequate reply to charges of discrimination againstindustrial users.5. The resolution of this problem which has not been easedby the delay that has taken place is complicated by considerations of prices and incomes policy, and by the facts of the parliamentary situation which I shall have to face early in the new Session. Thereseem to be three possible courses open to us:(i) To allow the Coal Board now to go forward with priceproposals to the Consumers&apos; Councils, the increases to be operative from an early date except for the defermentof house coal increases to 1st April, 1966.(ii) To refer the Coal Board&apos;s price proposals for industrial and domestic coal to the National Board for Prices and incomes with a view to obtaining an early decision from them. (The proposals would also have to go to the consumers&apos; Councils.)(iii) To review the situation in a few months&apos; time, to considerthe case for an increase then, and, if appropriate, submitit to the National Board for Prices and Incomes, asproposed by the First Secretary.6. All of these courses involve difficulties. In preparation fora Coal Industry Bill, which must be enacted before Christmas, we will be producing next month White Papers on Fuel Policy and on coal Finances. That legislation will contain provisions for the
writing-off of about  400 million and it will have to make provisionfor dealing with the deficit in 1965-66, after capital reconstruction.We shall be open to justifiable criticism if our proposals do not contain specific provisions for meeting, in one way or another, the continuing deficit and for establishing a viable basis for the industry,after capital reconstruction. It seems to me very difficult in thesecircumstances for us to take the line proposed by the First secretary that we will consider price increases later on, and, if appropriate,submit them to the National Board for Prices and Incomes. I would wish to be in a position, in the debates on the Coal Industry Bill, tomake some reference to concrete proposals for price increases tocover the increases in costs, after allowing for the assistance whichwe are providing for the coal industry in the Bill. As far as prices and incomes policy is concerned, we would be able to demonstrate thatwe are giving massive assistance to the coal industry, and that wehave already delayed price increases for several months. This is far more than we can expect anybody in the private sector to do.If there had to be a reference to the Prices and IncomesBoard, I would prefer it to be done as soon as possible ratherthan to be delayed until next year. There are, however, strong arguments against such reference. It would mean putting the questionof price increases sub judice with the Prices and Incomes Board, andcreating an area of uncertainty in a focal part of the Coal Bill.Moreover, I foresee embarrassment for us in a report by the prices and Incomes Board. It could hardly avoid examining the revenueposition of the Coal Board for the last year or so, identifying the time at which price increases were first mooted, and noting the inconclusiveexchanges between the Coal Board and the Government. We mighthave trouble too about the Coal Board Accounts for the year to31st March, 1965. These showed a small profit, but the underlyingposition was of considerable loss and the position has been worseningsince mid-1963. I fear that any public document on these subjectswould merely provide ammunition for our critics.7. We must face the fact that coal costs have been and are going up and that increases in coal prices are, at any time, awkward.Indeed, increases now are more difficult than they would have been at 1st April, 1965 the date originally agreed. We have to graspthis nettle sometime, and I would be in favour of following course(i) in paragraph 5. No great harm, however, would be done if theindustrial coal price increases were postponed until 1st January, 1966,the date as from which the new Coal Bill will have to be operative.F. L.Ministry of Power, S.W.I,29th September, 1965.
