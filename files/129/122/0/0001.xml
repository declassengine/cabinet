J. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.12th July, 1965

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ALLOCATIONWe v/ere asked by the Prime Minister tc consider and make recommendations about the public expenditure programmes up to 1969-70,in terms o  the Cabinet decisions of 28th January (C. C. (65) 5th Conclusions,Minute 3).    As supporting documents we are arranging for the circulation,under cover of a separate note (C.(65) 97), of -(i)     a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer settingcut the background of our work;(ii)     submissions which were made to our Committee by the seven Ministers whose programmes we have examined.I.    THE BA3I3 OF ALLOCATION2. The Cabinet decided, and this was announced, that the planning ofpublic sector expenditure (central and local government and national insurance funds, current and capital, excluding debt interest) should bebased on an average annual rate of increase of 4^ per cent a year at constant prices from 1964-65 to 1969-70,3, The Committee has considered the seven main civil programmes.(Category A Programmes).    These, together with defence, are about 80 percent of the total, and probably about 9E per cent of that expenditure f or which effective long-term programming is at present possible.4. It is assumed that the Defence Budget will not exceed in 1969-70the level of  2, 000 million at 1964 prices.5. The Cabinet had decided the sise of &quot;basic!! programmes which departments should prepare.    For the sevenprograrnmes, the aggregateincrease is  1,858 million, i.e, an increase of 30 per cent from 1964-65to 1969-70.    This may be compared with the 17 per cent increase in thisfive-years period to provide for the growth of personal consumption in thePlan;  and the 21 per cent increase of GNP assumed for this five-yearsperiod.    The public sector is therefore increasing nearly twice as fast asis planned for personal consumption, and half as fast again as gross national product.6. The reason for choosing 1969-70 as the year for the allocation isthat it is the nearest year for purposes of the Plan - for which of course the decisions are needed;  and in many fields it is necessary now to take decisions which depend upon an assessment of what the country will be ableto afford in 1969-70.7. The work has been closely co-ordinated with the Flan.    This has brought to the front important physical limitations, notably in construction,which effectively seta the limit to housing, and in man-power, where it isa striking fact that of total additional demands of 900,000 in the period ofthe Plan (and against which there are resources of only 400, 000 in sight),no less than 266,000 are required by education, 143, 000 by the health service, 99,000 by other public administration (including defence) and150,000 by the construction industry.    This illustrates the great and rapidly increasing demands of the public sector.8, The Departments submitted &quot;additional&quot; programmes for 1969-70totalling  762 million, i.e. a further increase of 12 per cent in the fiveyears, making 42 per cent in all.SECRET   &quot;l&quot;

9.       7/e start from the judgment that we can only afford  200- 250million of these &quot;additionais&quot;.     This is what is left after taking thepermissible increase of 4^ per cent, and deducting from it the needs ofthe ether programmes not now under discussion (Category 3), and an allowance of  100- 150 million for contingencies.    V/&quot;e are satisfied thatthis is a very small contingency allowance for total programmes of theorder of  11,600 million, which must provide inter alia for any payrevaluations in the public sector - i.e. increases in pay that are greaterthan the average for the whole economy.1G.      At the same time as determining the &quot;additional&quot; programmes for1969-70, the Committee also considered the &quot;additional&quot; programmes for 1966-67, with the object of reducing them to the minimum possible level.    This is the period cf maximum strain, the period of criticalsignificance in the recovery of the balance of payments.    It is essentialto keep within the 4^ per cent level in that year.il.       We set about the tack by interviewing the seven Ministersindividually, all in one day, and we questioned all of them along similar lines, designed to establish the order of priorities in their programmes,and to determime what would be the consequences if only a small partof their &quot;additional&quot; programmes could be afforded, both for 1969-70 andfor 1966-67.    The following section sets out our comments on eachprogramme in the light of these discussions.II.   EXAMINATION OF PROGRAMME 3Education12,      The basic programme (including school meals and milk) increasesfrom  1.459 million in 1964-65 to  1,888 million in 1969-70, an increaseof  429 million, or nearly 30 per cent.    The proposed additional programme for 1969-70 is  166 million.13.      Of the total of  166 million (Great Britain),  91 million represen-ted additional capital expenditure,  47 million a variety of additions to current expenditure, and  28 million for the proposals for the university of the Air and the plan for independent schools.    The Secretary of  tateexpressed the view that apart from the latter, on which decisions had notyet been taken, a reduction cf the additional programme would result inpostponements of improvements in the supply of teachers, school building and higher education.    No additional programme a had been included for conversion to comprehensive schools, improvement of student grants, development cf nursery schools, etc.14.      It is accepted that the expansion of the basic programme is very substantial, both in a.bsoiute and in percentage term.!?, providing inprimary and secondary education for an improvement in standards(incKiding the pupil/teacher ratio) as well as for greater numbers;and in further and higher education provision for a large increase in numbers.    The man-power requirements for the service as a wholeincrease by 3. 7 per cent per year for the period from 1964 to 1970.15.      For 1969-70, the Committee recommend an additional programmeof  35 million net.    The figure has been fixed with the following considerations in mind:-

(i) A working party is considering the possibility of an increase inthe price of school meals together v/ith some improvement inthe quality.    The price has net been increased since 1957;and children from low-income families get their meals free.The saving from a straight increase from Is. to Is. 6d. (thecost is now 2s,10d.) would be  20 million a year.    Any savingbefore 1969 would be added to the  35 million additional programme,(ii) A large part of the additional programme represents capitalexpenditure incurred in the last two years of the programme.In the event of a marked improvement in the economic pros-pects in a year or two&apos;s time, it would still be possible to add to the capital programmes.(iii) The basic programme, together with some relatively smalladditional items, e.g. the work in the period on the proposedNorth.-Ea.st Technological University, would appear to provideadequately for educational work of direct economic importance,e. g. industrial training.(iv) The Committee attached great importance to the reduction ofcostj both of capital programmes and in economy of man-power,and thought that savings should be possible by 1969.16.      For 1966-67, for which the proposed additional programme was 29 million, the Committee recommend a figure of  3 million.Health and Welfare17.      The basic programme (including welfare foods) increases from 1,238 million in 1964-65 to  1,504 million in 1969-70, an increase of 266 million, or 21-g- per cent.    The proposed additional programme for1969-70 is  88 million.    The Committee accept the Ministers view thatthe basic programme is very tightly drawn,18.      Of the additional programme of  88 million (Great Britain), 30 million is represented by the removal of the remaining charges,i. e. for dental treatment, dentures and spectacles.    v7e recommendthat no provision should be made for these in 1969-70.    It must benoted that the cost of the removal of prescription charges, estimatedearlier at  25 million, is now put at  34 million a year, of which 10 million represents the increase in patient demand.    The basic programme allows for this.19.      Of the other  58 million additional programme,  33 millionrepresents hospital capital and current expenditure, and  10 milliongeneral practitioners1 facilities and compensation.20.      For 1969-70, the Committee recommend an additional programmeof  25 million.    This hao been fixed with the following considerations in mind:-(i)  The hospital capital programme is proving more costly than expected;  and it involves increases in current expendituretoo.    Some increase is needed to keep it moving forward, overand above the 50 per cent increase provided in the basic programme.-3-SECRET&quot;s

(ii)  The programme involves very large increases in man-power -16 per cent for hospitals and 30 per cent for local authorities.There must be considerable doubt whether these numbers willbe available, except at the expense of other equally important national objectives.(iii)  There is an increase of nearly 40 per cent in local authoritycurrent expenditure, which is unlikely to be achieved unlessheavy pressure from Whitehall is applied to the local authorities.21.      For 1966-67, for which the proposed additional programme,excluding the removal of charges, is  25 million, the committee recommend a figure of  8 million.    This would have to include the costof a measles vaccination programme ( 4 million) if this became practicablduring this year.Benefits and Assistance22,      The basic programme increases from  2,120 million in 1964-65 to 2,860 million in 1969-70, an increase of  740 million or 35 per cent.The proposed additional programme for 1969-70 is  185 million;  of whichthe main elements are the income guarantee ( 100 million), wage-relatedsickness benefit ( 30 million), improvements in widows&apos; benefits and family allowances ( 45 million),   and a contingency allowance for otherimprovements ( 10 million).23.      The basic programme provides for an uprating of benefits and assistance at the same rate as the increase in average earnings.    Theincrease of benefits in April, 1965 was significantly more than wouldhave been required by this formula, and the Minister pointed out that inthe previous thirteen years the increase had been slightly more than theformula.24.      The Committee considered first the problem of 1966-67.    Theissue is one of selection between three projects:-(i) uprating of benefits.    At the present rate of increase of earnings, there would be a case for an increase of 5s,( 130 million a year) in April, 1966, or of 7s. 6d.( 200 million a year) in October, 1966.(ii) wage-related short-term benefits.    This would need to cover,at least unemployment and sickness benefit.    The cheapestproposal is  30 million a year, of which  20 million is included in the basic programme, but there are others underconsideration costing up to  55 million.    The economicMinisters attach weight to this project as an aid to industrialr ed ernpl oyment.(iii)  income guarantee.    This project is now taking shape in aCommittee under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the duchy.    It is expected that a project could be ready for introduction in October, 1966.    The cost is estimated at 100 million a year, assuming a guarantee level of  4 8s.plus rent.    The Minister regards this project as a whole, andwould be unwilling to plan to introduce it in smaller steps,based e,g. on age.

Benefits and Assistance26.      For 1966-67, most members of the Committee recommend:-(i)  Being ready if necessary to uprate benefits and assistance inOctober, 1966, not exceeding the rate of increase of earningssince spring, 1965.(ii) Introduction of wage-related short-term benefits in October,1966, at an estimated cost of  45 million a year ( 20 million of which is &quot;basic&quot; programme): this allows the first three days of sickness to qualify for benefit retrospectively.(iii) Not introducing the income guarantee in 1966-67.(iv) Improvement of benefits for workmen&apos;s compensation &quot;old ca.ses&quot;( 1 million).The cost to the &quot;additional&quot; programme in 1966*67 would be  13j,- million,say  14 million.27.      The Chancellor of the Duchy favours introducing the income guarantee in October, 1966 ( 50 million in 1966-67), and postponing the uprating of benefits until April, 1967, and then uprating them by much less than the average increase of money earnings.    He would himselfsee it as an advantage that this would concentrate the money available on the poorer people, ?,t the expense of the increa.se to pensioners generally.He contends that the substantial improvements in pensions ra.tes last march were clearly intended to carry over until after the introduction of income guarantee.    The other members of the Committee consider thatthe Government are likely to be under great pressure to uprate benefitsduring 1966-67;  and that the Chancellor of the 33uchy&apos;s course would inthe event be likely to lead to both a general uprating and the income guarantee.2C.      For 1969-70, there was the same division of opinion.    TheGovernment made two long-term pledges, one to introduce the income guarantee, and the other to uprate benefits matching the increase of average earnings.    There was not likely to be enough money to carry outboth in 1969-70, unless pensions were given half the total available for additional programmes ( 100 million for income guarantee and  25 million for wage-related short-term benefits).    The Chancellor of the Duchyfavoured the income guarantee, with an announced change of policy onuprating of benefits, relating this to the increase of the consumption ofthe working population, or the co st-of - living, or other indicators, whichwould save enough to finance the income guarantee.    The rest of theCommittee considered that the income guarantee in its present shape wasnot of high priority, and thought it premature to lay down long-term policy.*29.      The Committee decided, therefore, that the best course was to reserve a sum for additional benefits and assistance in 1969-70, and recommended  60 million.    This would include  25 million for wage-related short-term benefits and  1 million for benefits for men onworkmen&apos;s compensation.25.      The Minister expressed the view that if the income guaranteewere introduced in October, 1966, it would be possible to postpone anuprating of benefits until April, 1967.    Che regarded the income guarantee as being of higher priority than wage-related short-term benefits.

Police and Prisons30.      The basic programme increases from  230 million in 1964-65 to 271 million in 1969-70, an increase of  41 million or IS per cent.    Theproposed additional programme for 1969-70 is  18 million, of which 11.2 srnillion is in respect of the police, and  6j million represents aproposal to enable prisoners to be paid wages at industrial rates.31.      The Committee recommend that an additional programme of 10 million be allowed for 1969-70, towards the proposals for the police.The proposal for an additional programme in 1966-67 is less than -f- million, and could reasonably in the Committee&apos;s view be absorbed bythe basic programme.Roads32.      The basic programme increases from  406 million in 1964-65 to 575 million in 1969-70, an increase of  169 million, or 42 per cent.    Anadditional programme of  30 million is proposed by the Ministers for1969-70, part of which represents an expansion of the existing programme in the last two years of the period, and part represents expenditure on carparks by local authorities.33.      This large increase is provided by the working out of the long-term road programme, and the Minister pointed out to us that it consisted of projects which were already in process of preparation and on whichstarting dates had already been given to local authorities:  in spite of thevery large increase, the provision of roads was still expected to lagbehind the increasing number of vehicles.    Many of the projects were of direct economic importance, and of great significance to the regional development programniec.34.      The Committee recommend both for 1969-70 and for 1966-67, thatthe basic programme should be allowed to stand, but that no additional programme should be provided, i.e. that if the Minister wished to under-take elements in the additional programme, this would be financed fromthe provision for the basic programme.    The Committee consideredcarefully whether a cut should be made in the basic programme, butdecided against this on the grounds that it might cause undue dislocation of the long-term planning, and in any event it would mean a downwardadjustment of a programme which had been announced by the previous government.    It seemed ciea.r to the Committee, moreover, that itwould be necessary to re-examine the road programme in the next two orthree years in order to clarify the priorities as between motorways andtrunk roa.ds and classified roads, and in the process of developing a co-ordinated system of rail and road transport, and in relation to the contribution that the Road Research Laboratory might make to the econ-omical provision of roads; and in these circumstances we thought itbetter for the Departments to proceed with this long-term work ratherthan to engage on what would be bound to be somewhat arbitrary cuttingand postponement of projects already under way.Overseas Aid35,      The basic programme increases from  181 million in 1964-65 to 229 million in 1969-70, an increase of  48 million or 26f per cent.The proposed additional programme for 1969-70 is  106 million.

36.      The basic programme laid down by the Cabinet as a result of its meeting on 28th January, 1965 was defined simply as what would result from maintaining the current proportion of aid to G. N. P., i. e, , 0.7 percent.    It was not intended to represent a detailed programme, and thePrime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the size of the overseas economic aid programme should be reviewed in relation to both public expenditure and the balance of payments.      The additional programme now submitted is designed to increase the proportion cf aid toG, N.P. to the Government&apos;3 target of 1 per cent, but it represents a detailed programme.37.      There were three main considerations which the Committee felt itnecessary to take into account, however sympathetic they were to the objectives of overseas aid:-(i) It seemed to us wrong to be increasing our aid disbursements ata time when we are borrowing heavily from abroad to buy our essential supplies, and when the recovery of our balance ofpayments is not yet in sight.(ii)  It was argued by the Minister that increasing the aid programme was essential to our foreign policy, and the Secretaries of Statefor Foreign Affaire, the Commonwealth Relations Office, andthe Colonial Office have written to the Chancellor of theExchequer endorsing the importance of aid.    The committee did not examine this view, to determine the weight which canbe attached to aid operations, but we are bound to point cut thatthe weakness of sterling might be highly damaging to our foreignpolicy, especially -when it involves us in having to borrow on an unprecedented scale from virtually every source open to us.The Minister argued that the amounts were small, representingonly about 2 per cent of the external transactions.    But aid of 180 million in 1964 is a very substantial amount in relation tothe balance of payments deficit of  750 million - and the 1965-66figure is estimated at over  250 million.There is room for some legitimate technical disagreement aboutthe foreign exchange coot of overseas aid i. e. about how far itis in effect borne on the reserves and how far on the UnitedKingdom&apos;s productive resources.    The Treasury and theDepartment of Economic Affairs would reckon that it is between30 and 40 per cent;  and the Ministry of Overseas development would say that under normal conditions it would be 25 to 30 percent, and an expansion of the aid programme could in their view be arranged in a manner that would limit the foreign exchequer ingecoot to 15 per cent.    In relation to the work of this Committeethere are two considerations here.    First, whatever the exactpercentage may be, it is much higher for aid than for any other of the programmes under examination;  and second, apa.rtaltogether from the balance of payments, the amount of resourceand the proposed additions are very large, and the proportionate increase from 1964-65 would be 35 per cent.38.      It appears that the disbursements are expected to run much higher in 1965-66 and 1966-67 than the basic programme.    The following table shows the course:--7-

1962-631963-641964-651965-661966-67  million.148175192220 (basic 196)251 (basic 216)39.      We have asked for a careful analysis to be made to see how this hascorne about, and to see which countries are expected to get these verylarge increases, and the implications of containing 1966-67 disbursementswithin the basic figure of  216 million.    The Minister says that disburse-rnents of this scale in 1966-67 are implicit in existing policy, but we find it difficult to understand why expansion on the scale of these figures isessential to any of the Governments objectives,40.      The Committee recommend that the disbursements should bereduced in 1966-67 to the lowest figure practicable, and that commitmentsshould be made at a rate designed to yield no larger disbursements in subsequent years than are provided in the basic programme.      they recommend that a report should be prepared for the Cabinet by the Treasury,the Department of Economic Affairs and the Ministry ox overseas development to show what action would be required to keep disbursementswithin  216 million in 1966-67 rising to  230 million in 1969-70.Housing41.      The basic programme for local authorities&apos; and new towns&apos; capitalexpenditure increases from  520 million in 1964-65 to  626 million in1969-70, an increase of  106 million, or 20f per cent.    The proposedadditional programme for 1969-70 is  106 million.    For housing subsidies,the basic programme increases from  153 million to  212 million, anincrease of  59 million, or 33f per cent;  and the additional programmethere is  63 million,42.      The baoic programme was fixed for this operation at a levelequivalent to the Cabinet&apos;g decision in February providing for 150, 000local authority approvals in 1965, and was continued at this rate to 1969.The Minister pointed out that this procedure gave a lower rate of increaseof basic programme than most of the other Departments had,    We have of course taken this into account in our recommendations.National Objective43.      The Committee handled housing somewhat differently from the other programmes, taking as a starting-point the desirability of a nationalhousing objective, covering both public and private building.    77e workedwith a target of 500, 000 houses (U. K. : work done) in 1970.    This,together with the other prospective claims upon the construction industry,public and private, is estimated to require increased man-power of15 &apos;- 000- which will be difficult to get;  and this will require restraint inciner construct!&apos;.-&quot;i programmes.44.      In very broad terms, there appeared to be a reasonable case forrough balance between the public and the private sector - i.e. houses torent and houses to ;own.    With a total of 500,000, the private sectorprogramme (including privately owned housing financed by localauthorities) would be around 250, 000.    To keep within this figure, which-8-SECRET

would be essential for keeping the total housing within 500,000, would mean that the number of private starts could not be allowed to exceed the level of1964.    We are extremely doubtful whether it would be practicable tocontrol private housing at this level.    It v/ould be expected that, with theG. N.P. in 1970 about 25 per cent above 1964, the demands for home owner-ship would be very much larger than ever before, and this would be stimulated by the Governments proposal to subsidise housing mortgages.45.     At the -present moment, there is great uncertainty about theimmediate course of private housing.    But if the national economy developsand expands in accordance with the Plan, which is the basis of all the public expenditure planning, it must be assumed that the private sector will bereaching and exceeding 250, 000 by the late 1960&apos;s.    It follows from this that, given the maximum 500, 000 figure, it v/ould be impracticable for theGovernment to commit themselves to a public sector programme of a.nyparticular size in the neighbourhood of 250, 000;  and the possibility wouldhave to be kept open of reducing the public sector programme to the &quot;basic&quot;level if the total seems likely to overshoot the Plan limit, and if it provesimpracticable to contain the growth of private housing.46.     We considered the lay-out of public sector approvals in 1969 orstarts in 1969-70, to a total of 245, 000, on the following lines :-Approvals 1969 orstarts 1969-70England and Wales&quot;Local authoidtiesNew TownsScotlandNorthern IrelandRousing AssociationsGovernment Departments170,00011,50038,0008, 00015,0002, 500(150, 000 is &quot;basic&quot;)(&quot;additionals&quot; to come outof local authority figure)(32, 500 is &quot;basic&apos;&apos;)245,000Local Authority and New Towns Capital Expenditure47.     For England and Wales local authorities, the approvals might be asfollows:  1963, 118.000:  1964, 140,000:  1965, 150,000:  1966, 150,000(an increase in that year would involve &quot;additional&quot; expenditure in 1966-67):1967, 155,000:  1968, 162, 500:  1969, 170,000.    The &quot;&quot;additional&quot; capitalexpenditure involved in 1969-70, including New Towns, would be about 65 million.    Cne of our members would favour working on a tentativepublic sector programme of 250, 000 (subject to the flexibility in paragraph45) which would imply a figure of  80 million instead of  65 million.48.     For the reasons of flexibility given above, it would be impracticable for the Government to commit themselves either to 245, 000 public sectorstarts or to local authority approvals of 170,000 for 1969.    But it would be appropriate to use the figure of  65 million for an &quot;additional&quot; capitalexpenditure programme subject to these conditions.

Subsidies49.     The basic programmes for subsidies already show a very large increase following from the 20 per cent increase of public housing invest-ment.    The &quot;additional&quot; programmes for subsidies, at  63 million,include:-1969-70  millionSubsidies on Minister&apos;s &quot;additional&quot; housing proposalBigger subsidies for local authorities 23New subsidy for mortgages 346350.     The proposed local authority subsidy provides instead of the oldunit grant the difference between the rate of interest paid by the localauthority for the capital for the new house, and the rate of 4 per cent.    Atthe 6f per cent rate, the new subsidy would be  75 a year at the outset,compared with the present  24, with supplements for high cost in both cases.    K the rate of interest were to fall, of course, the Exchequer would benefit; and vice versa.    The payments would not begin until the spring of1967, so there would be no &quot;additional&quot; expenditure in 1966-67.51.     A number of suggestions have been considered for carrying out theGovernments undertaking on private mortgages.    The figure of  34 million in 1969-70 (rising to  75 million in a further five years) relates to the ideaof a subsidy on a &quot;slice&quot; of  1, 000 of every new mortgage, equivalent tothe difference between the going rate of interest and 4 per cent.    Thereare other proposals, including the proposals for giving subsidy to people with relatively low incomes to an extent equivalent to the tax reliefreceived by people with higher incomes.    The Committee would set outthree important considerations:-(i) the need to avoid any &quot;additional&quot; expenditure in 1966-67;(ii) the schemes to subsidise private future mortgages must beput into effect at once, and the private beneficiaries wouldbe benefitting a year before the local authorities;(iii) the very large open-ended commitments involved in ail schemesof this land;  there appears to be no possibility of limiting thenumbers in x-espect of which subsidy will be given.52.     The Committee recommend that whatever schemes are adopted for new public and private subsidies, there should be no &quot;additional&quot;expenditure in 1966-67, and the total &quot;additional&quot; expenditure in 1969-70should not exceed  45 million, compared with the existing proposals for 63 million above.-10-

Conclusion53.     The Committee recommend the following allocation:-(a) In view of the primary political importance of housing, we haveallocated to it about half of the total available  200-- 250 million,a figure of  110 million for 1969-70.    This is divided between 65 million for capital expenditure and  45 million for subsidies.(This is subject to the reservation of one member inparagraph 48).(b) We regard this as the maximum that can be afforded.    it represents a total increase over 1964-65 of  275 million, or41 per cent.(c) We recommend that there should be no &quot;additional&quot; expenditurein 1966-67, either for capital expenditure or for new subsidies to local authorities or private mortgages.    (There is of course a substantial increase in both in the basic programme).54.     The Committee&apos;s views may be summed up as follow n:-(a) We assume a target of 500, 000 houses (U. K. : work done) in 1970:physically attainable only with great difficulty.(b) We envisage a rough balance between the public and private sectors.(c) If G.N. P. rises by 25 per cent by 1970, a.nd partievdarly if private housing is to be encouraged by subsidy, the demand for privatehouses is likely to exceed 250,000 by 1970.    It will therefore benecessary to find means of holding the private sector back.    Butit is not yet clear how this is to be done;  and the ability to carryout a public sector programme of this size depends upon it being done.(d) Our allocation of  65 million in 1969-70 would enable the public sector to rise to 245,000 houses by that year.    One of our membershowever, would prefer to raise that figure to 250, 000 which wouldrequire an allocation of  00 million in 1969-70,    The allocationwould enable approvals of local authority houses in England andWales to be held at 150,000 in 1966 and to rise thereafter to170, 000 in 1967.(e) For &quot;additional&quot; subsidies, to local authorities and privatemortgages, we allocated  45 million, which is less than theMinister&apos;s proposal of  63 million.     The Minister&apos;s subsidyplans have not been considered in detail, but we are satisfiedthat  45 million is the most that can be provided;  and if moreis required it must be at the expense of the capital expenditure.(f) The new local authority subsidies will not involve expenditure in1966-67, and new subsidies to private mortgages should not doso either.-11-

IU.    SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS55.     The Committee recommends additional programmes as follows,subject to the various qualifications and explanations set out above:-11 Additiona&apos;.&apos;.&apos;&apos; Prog ramme s(  million)1969-70 1966-67Education (paragraphs 15 and 16)Health (paragraphs 20 and 21)Benefits and assistance(paragraphs 26-29)Police and prisons (paragraph 31)Roads (paragraph 34)Overseas aid (paragraph 40)Housing:  (paragraphs 53 and 54)capital expenditure 65 )subsidy 45 )240 25If these &quot;additional&quot; programmes are accepted, the aggregate will increase from 1964-65 to 1969-70 from just over  6,300 million to  0,400 million,an increase of  2, 100 million, or 33 per cent.56.     These are mainly Great Britain figures, and it would be necessaryto arrange for division between England and Wades and Scotland.57.     It will be necessary later on in the year to consider the smallerprogrammes, and to consider also those expenditures which are not&quot;programmable&quot;.    We recommend that these be dealt with in the sametone as those which we have been considering, i. e. with no &quot;additional&quot;expenditures in 1966-67 except where the case is so strong as to be unavoidable, and allocations for later years which as far as possiblereflect the same stringency as our proposed allocations for 1969-70.July, 196535 net 325 860 1410110
