THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1965C (65) 125 Copy No.    6 614th September, 1965CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE-THE GRANT system memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate this memorandum, as Chairman of the ministerial committee on Local Government Finance, to seek approval by theCabinet of the proposals on which we are agreed and settlement ofa few points of difference.2.   After full examination we have concluded that:(i) there is no possibility of any major new source of localrevenue to supplement or replace the rates;(ii) the total expenditure of local authorities is bound to risesteeply over the next decade at least more steeply thanpublic expenditure as a whole and more steeply thanthe Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.);(iii) though there are various ways in which the rating systemmight be improved we have not completed our examination of these the rates can never have morethan a limited buoyancy and cannot be expected to bearas high a proportion of rapidly rising expenditure as theybear now;(iv) some way must therefore be found of shifting an increasing proportion of the burden on to central taxes, while stillleaving the rates to bear as much as they reasonably can and leaving as much independence as possible with thelocal authorities.3. Our proposals do not include housing, which we suggestshould be dealt with separately. For the rest, we propose that thepresent system of Exchequer aid to local services should be entirelyrecast and should have two distinct elements assistance to capital projects and assistance to current expenditure which would otherwisefall on the rates. The following paragraphs give the broad outline of the plan, without covering all the detailed points.6101A
A.   CAPITAL GRANTS4. We propose that lump-sum Exchequer grants, at a commonrate of 50 per cent, should be payable towards expenditure on approved capital projects in the main local authority programmes which Departments already supervise and which are not revenue-earning-that is, education, highways, health, welfare, police, fire and child care. (There are one or two minor services where capital grants are payable at present; and we think they should continue,though they may need to be recast.)5. This would involve a reduction to 50 per cent of the capital grants now payable for highway schemes at 50 per cent, 60 per centor 75 per cent according to the class of road. The other majorservices mentioned do not at present attract any capital grants atall, but loan charges taken into account in the General Grant.6. The total effect of these capital grants would be to reducethe local authorities&apos; borrowing needs, and the burden of loan charges on the rates (what remains of this burden would be eligible for theExchequer assistance towards current expenditure under the second part of the plan). They would thus in effect reduce for local authoritiesboth the high cost of land which we have found no way of doing through our Land Commission policy and the cost of highinterest rates. They would involve a considerable addition to Votes,but they would not increase the total public expenditure on capital account and would not in themselves call for higher taxation (except to the very minor extent to which the net burden of loan charges would be switched from the rates to the Exchequer). They would reinforce the control over capital programmes now exercised by central Departments (mainly through loan sanction procedure). Andthey would make possible a new elasticity of policy on localborrowings from the Exchequer.B.   SUPPORT OF THE RATES7. We consider that so long as total local expenditure,reasonably and economically conceived, must rise faster than theG.D.P., it is reasonable that rates as a whole should rise in line withthe G.D.P., and that Exchequer assistance should be so fixed that they need not rise more steeply than that. This has led us to the conception of a &quot; moving Exchequer guarantee &quot;. The Government would look atthe total prospective local expenditure, either for a year ahead orfor longer periods, apply their own judgment to it and determine what total they would be prepared to recognise as the basis of theirguarantee. (Local authorities could spend more, at the sole cost ofthe rates, if they chose.) From this total there would be deducted therevenue which would be yielded by rates if average poundages rosein line with the growth in the G.D.P.; and the remainder would befixed in advance as the &quot; total Exchequer contribution &quot; withinwhich all Exchequer assistance to rate-borne services would beincluded. This total would be adjustable for subsequent changes in wages and prices, but not otherwise.

8. This system should combine reasonable control by thecentral Government over their total commitment with reasonableautonomy for the local authorities. There would be no guaranteeabout the level of rates for particular authorities.9. Once the total Exchequer contribution is fixed in this way as it has never been fixed before the main problem is how toensure that it is distributed fairly, with regard both to the differentneeds and to the different resources of the various authorities. Wethink that for this purpose there must be a number of specific grantsrelated to particular services and that the remainder should be distributed as a general Rates Support Grant on a formula designedto give something to every authority but most where it is most needed. The present General Grant, Rate Deficiency Grant and (inScotland) Equalisation Grant would, as such, disappear.Specific grants10. Under this plan specific grants take on quite a newcomplexion. Neither their number nor their size makes any difference to total Exchequer expenditure or to total burden on rates: they areno longer an addition to the Exchequers general support of the ratesbut a subtraction from it; and they should no longer be regarded asmarking a service out as specially important or as specially deservingof Exchequer support. The main purpose of having any specific grants at all is to improve the equity of the distribution of a pre- -determined total of Exchequer aid to the rates; and in order tokeep available for the Rates Support Grant as much of the total aspossible, specific grants should be approved only where there is a very strong case for them.(a) Needs grants11. For some essential services the burden falls very unevenlybetween authorities, either geographically or in time or both.Examples are port health control and urban redevelopment (which only a minority of authorities have to do at all). Unless some of thetotal Exchequer contribution is used to give differential support tothis differential expenditure, its distribution would clearly be unfairbetween authorities. We are therefore agreed that there is a good case for specific grants for such services. We describe them as&quot; needs grants&quot;, because they recognise the difference betweenauthorities in the needs for expenditure on these services.12. Much the biggest service is Education, which does not atpresent get any specific grant. Though it is a universal service, theburden it imposes is by no means equal among authorities, because there are wide variations between them in the proportion of schoolchildren and students to total population. And because theexpenditure is so large there would be a considerable distortion inthe equity of the distribution unless some of the Exchequer aid were distributed between authorities by reference to the differential needs in education expenditure instead of by reference to more generalfactors. This is the case for a specific &quot; needs grant&quot; for Education.SECRET / &quot;6101 a 2

13. We are agreed that this grant should be a &quot; formula &quot; grant,rather than a fixed percentage of each authority^ expenditure as approved for grant. That is, the Education Departments would takethe total estimated prospective expenditure by local authorities on education (including school meals and milk), decide whether it wasa realistic and adequate sum in the light of Government policy andof the Governments long-term expenditure decisions, and pay a proportion of that sum to education authorities on a formulareflecting specific factors relevant to the education service.14. We also agree with proposals by the Minister of Transportwhereby maintenance and minor improvement of classified roadswould cease to be specifically grant-aided (though selectedimprovement schemes would become eligible for capital grants). Thisrevenue expenditure would be aided only through the Rates support grant.15. We are not agreed on a proposal by the Minister of Healththat a specific needs grant should be introduced in respect of the health and welfare services in England and Wales.16. The Minister argues that two-thirds of the expenditure ison old people and on young children and their mothers, and that forthese groups the demographic disparities between authorities are aswide as they are for school children; further, that these services willnot get sufficient priority in local counsels if they are not treated for grant in the same way as education.17. The argument to the contrary is that since the expenditurein question is only about one-tenth as much as expenditure on education, the case for a grant to iron out potential inequities in distribution is much weaker; that the &quot;prestige&quot; argument isinadmissible under the new system; and that the case is therefore not strong enough to overcome the presumption in favour of generaldistribution (see paragraph 10).(b) Control grants18. The other possible sort of specific grant is a &quot; controlgrant&quot;, designed purely as a means of imposing control from thecentre. Such a grant, for a service where relative needs do not greatlydiffer among authorities, and paid to all alike at the same percentage, does nothing to improve distribution: on the contraryit works the other way, giving the richer authorities more, and the poorer less, than they would get if there were no grant.19. We are agreed that there is a special case for a controlgrant in respect of Civil Defence, because without it the localauthorities would be disinclined to meet much expenditure. A policy review is at present going on but the total involved is too small to constitute a serious loss to the Rates Support Grant.20. The Home Secretary would also like to have a controlgrant for police (which, apart from highways, is the only majorservice which has a specific grant at present), to institute one (perhaps
temporarily) for child care, and to keep open the possibility of control grant for the fire service until an enquiry which he isproposing for that service has reported.21. He argues that strong central control of these services isessential and that the power to withhold, or threaten to withhold,grant is an effective way of compelling local authorities to complywith central policy on the development of the service and theappointment of staff.22. No one doubts the need for control. The doubt is whethera financial sanction is a necessary means of securing it. In other services the responsible Ministers make their policies effective byuse of statutory and other powers of direction or persuasion withouta specific grant.23. We are therefore not agreed on the Home Secretary&apos;sproposals, though some of us feel that there is more to be said for retaining the police grant, which already exists, than for institutingnew grants for child care and fire.Specific grants rate of grant24. The amount of money to be taken out of the total for thepurposes of a &quot; needs grant &quot; ought in theory to be no more and no less than is necessary in order to iron out the relevant disparitiesin expenditure needs: over-compensation would use up money which ought to go into the Rates Support Grant and would thus favour theless hard-pressed authorities at the expense of the others. For a&quot; control grant &quot; the amount should be the minimum necessary tosecure the control which the Department wants.25. There is as yet no scientific basis for fixing the amounts andwe are agreed in recommending that, to start with at any rate, allspecific grants should be at the common, and admittedly arbitrary,rate of 50 per cent (except that the higher rates now payable for civil defence should remain). This could be refined later if adjustment isfound necessary to secure equitable distribution of the total.26. This decision, together with a decision about specific grants for health and welfare, police, child care and fire, is vital to the size of the Rates Support Grant. The dominant factor is education. A50 per cent grant would not of course represent the total Exchequeraid made available for education under the new scheme: quite apartfrom the new capital grants for education, all current expenditure on education, as on other services, would go to swell the total exchequer contribution and would thus be aided to different degrees for different authorities through the Rates Support Grant. The total of exchequer aid will be considerably higher than before. It may takea little time for the novel implications of the scheme, and the novelcharacter of the education grant, to be appreciated by the localauthorities: but the Secretary of State for Education and Science isin agreement with the above proposal and preliminary soundings donot suggest a hostile reaction from the Association of Local EducationAuthorities.
27. Forward estimates are very speculative, but roughlyspeaking it appears that on the basis of constant (1964) prices theRates Support Grant under the new scheme (for Great Britain as awhole) would amount to about  660 million in 1969-70 (rather lessthan a quarter of total local current expenditure^ there were no specific grants for health and welfare, police, child care or fire andif the other specific grants were at 50 per cent. Specific grants at50 per cent for health and welfare and for police would reduce this 660 million by about  100 million each; for child care and for fireby about  25 million each. If the education grant distributed a sumequal to, say, 65 per cent instead of 50 per cent of educationalexpenditure, the  660 million would be reduced by well over 200 million.Costs28. If the present system were left unchanged, the cost of exchequer aid to local expenditure would in any case rise withrising costs and with the further development of local services. Thenew system will further increase the cost to the Exchequer, by amounts which depend not only on increases in local expenditure butalso on increases in the G.D.P. Rough estimates suggest that by theend of its first five years, on the basis of an annual rise of 4 per centin the G.D.P., the new scheme would produce an additional charge on the Exchequer as compared with the present scheme of about 200 million through the total Exchequer contribution in relief oflocal rates; and that by the end of 10 years the Exchequer shareof total rate-borne expenditure would have risen from about 55 percent to about 63 per cent. These figures are not of course affectedby decisions about the specific grants to be found from within thetotal Exchequer contribution. (In addition there would be about 125 million extra on Votes for the capital grants in relief of localborrowing; but this would not be a net increase on the Exchequer.)29. A scheme on these lines would over a period involve a formidable increase in central Government expenditure. We find itnecessary to ease the burden on the community as ratepayers, butthis is achieved only by increasing the burden on them as taxpayers an extra  200 million in five years&apos; time would be about an extra6d. on the income tax. Obviously this must limit what we can do inother directions.30. This leads me to say two things in my capacity asChancellor of the Exchequer. Firstly, this is a new and imaginativescheme, which has great potential advantages. The calculations havebeen made as carefully as possible, but there are wide ranges ofuncertainties about costs, pay, prices, the rate of growth of G.D.P.,etc. which could greatly affect the financial outcome. We are boundto reserve the right to amend and modify the scheme if we find itworking out very differently from what we now expect.31. Secondly, the problem arises from the rapid growth of localauthority expenditure especially education and roads, but in factall forms of expenditure, inside and outside control from Whitehall.
I am sure that in giving the guarantees which are involved in thisscheme we must satisfy ourselves that the local authorities arerestraining the growth of the expenditure in question, limiting it towhat is urgently necessary and carrying out their services efficiently and economically. We have taken our decisions determining thelong-term public expenditure on education, roads, health, police,housing; and must ensure that the local authorities&apos; element in theseexpenditures is contained accordingly. But the problem goes wider than this; and in my opinion we must regard it as integral to thisscheme that we develop with the local authorities effective modernmeans of keeping their expenditure to the minimum essential level.Conclusion32. It is intended to introduce the scheme in time to be operative by 1st April, 1967, and major legislation next Session isnecessary for this purpose. Much detailed discussion must beundertaken with local authorities before a Bill can be introduced, andthe Cabinefs authority for the main lines of the scheme is thereforenow needed. The full reactions of local authorities to the proposed new scheme will not be apparent until it has been possible to workout just how it will affect individual authorities. At that stage wemay think it right to vary our present ideas in some respects, and tothat extent approval at this stage must be provisional.33.  The Ministerial Committee invite the Cabinet:(i) to approve the main lines of the scheme as set out above;(ii) to decide whether, within the total Exchequer contributionthere should be specific grants for health and welfare,police, child care and fire.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,13th September, 1965.
ANNEXThis Annex shows how the Exchequer guarantee scheme in, respect of current expenditure would work. (It does not deal withcapital expenditure or the scheme for capital grants.) The figures used(  million) are purely illustrative and do not represent even tentativeestimates for any particular year. But they give a reasonable indication of the orders of magnitude involved and of the relative weight of thedifferent components.2. The starting point is the prospective total of local current expenditure. The Government would not necessarily accept, for thepurposes of their guarantee, the whole of this total. They might, forinstance, be prepared to accept 2,700 out of a total of 2,750.3. The putative yield of rates, if they rose in line with theG.D.P., might be 1,200. The total Exchequer contribution would thenbe 1,500 (about 54 per cent of total expenditure).4. Of this, some would be distributed by specific grants andthe rest by the Rates Support Grant. A specific grant at 50 per cent for education might take up, say, 750 and minor specific grants, say,50. On this basis the Rates Support Grant would be 700, rather underhalf the total Exchequer contribution.TableTotal local expenditure, as accepted by theGovernment    ...............      2,700Putative rate-yield...............      1,200Total Exchequer contribution    .........      1,500Of which (i) Specific grants (Education 750, rest 50) ...        800(ii) Rates Support Grant.........        7005. If other specific grants were added (such as police, health and welfare, fire or child-care) or if the rates of the education and minor grants were higher than 50 per cent, the total exchequer contribution would not be affected but the Rates Support grant would be correspondingly less.6. In so far as total expenditure rose faster than the G.D.P.,the total Exchequer contribution would come to bear an increasing proportion of total expenditure, because expenditure would beoutpacing rate-yield; specific grants and the Rates Support grant would both rise, and the ratio between them would stay roughly thesame if all types of expenditure rose at the same rate.
