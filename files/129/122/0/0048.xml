IkIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 148 COPY NO. g (]9th November, 1965CABINETARMED FORCES pay memorandum by the Secretary of State fori defence i am opposed to the proposals by the First Secretary andChancellor of the Exchequer in C. (65) 144 which reject the advice which has been agreed between officials of the Department of economic affairs, Treasury and Ministry of Defence.    This advice concerns onlythe pay of other ranks and officers (other than doctors and dentists) upto and including the rank of Brigadier or equivalent.    The pay ofofficers above this rank is related to the pay of Civil Service Under-Secretaries and above: and the pay of doctors and dentists to averagecareer earnings in the National Health Service.Reference to the board.       I am sure that it is neither politically defensible nor practicable to put the issue of an award - even an interim one - to the national board for a report within two months.     In this time they can merelyexpress an arbitrary opinion.    They cannot form a considered viewwithout a comprehensive revaluation of the immensely complicatedstructure of Service pay.    Literally hundreds of rates of pay wouldhave to be broken down into their components of separation, disturbance,rates for the job and so on.    All these factors v/ould have to beevaluated as would be the elements given in kind e. g. food, accommoda-tion and clothing.    The last time that this was done - by expertofficials - it took twelve months.3.       In any case to ask the Board to make a decision for U3, in a situation in which the Government is the employer and there is no union is surely tantamount to asking for outside advice on how to bring actionswhich are wholly within our own control into line with our own policy.4.       It is true that the Grigg increases are not due until 1st April,1966.    But the money for them (and for any Unterim.&apos; increase whichmay be recommended by the Board) should be included in the estimates which close at the very latest in mid-January.    We could of courseresort to the device of a Supplementary as was done in 1962, but this isan unconventional and inconvenient procedure and we were very critical of it when our predecessors used it.    If the money does not appear in theEstimates the Services will assume that they are not going to get any-thing.    If it does the amount will be known and compared with thefigures of the Grigg increases.    In either event v/e shall have to facestrong criticism inside and outside Parliament at the turn of the year.

&apos;5 c.The Need for the Grigg Increases5.       The biennial review arrangements are regarded as a long-term,agreements    This was certainly the view taken by my colleagues in the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes when I asked for an interim increase in Service pay earlier in the year.    The first secretary himself, in a recent paper (E. D. (65) 102, paragraph 16) forthe Committee on Economic Development, said that &quot;Where there isalready a firm commitment to an improvement . , . . for example through a long-term settlement .... it must clearly be honoured&quot;.    Theprinciple of honouring long-term agreements has been followed in thecase of Government industrials, the railwaymen  and the airportworkers i. e. the position reacted in negotiation was left undisturbedand the reference to the Board was effectively to consider the arrange-ments for the next claim.    I cannot accept that we should make an exception of the Services because the amount involved is large and/or because as a disciplined force they have no means of resisting thedecision.    If we do, there will be intense bitterness and resentment,not least because we shall be denying to the Forces the belated andpartial application of increases already given by this Government tothe Civil Service.6.       I must remind my colleagues that the pace-setter in the currentset of outside comparisons for Grigg is the Civil Service.    In a position where increases have been approved by the present Government for theCivil Service, including provisions for retrospection which, under normal Grigg procedure will not apply to the Armed Forces, it would begrossly unfair to select the Forces for discrirnhiatory treatment; theonly justification for doing so would be the argument that the increasesapproved for the Civil Service are themselves inflated, and in this case the first thing to be referred to the National Board would logicallybe the further 3f per cent increase which will apply to the Civil service on 1st January, 1966.Probable Consequences of Abandoning the Grigg review.       Since the outcome of the Grigg review is available for anybodyto work out any attempt to juggle with the calculated figures will be politically damaging.    In 1962 we were fiercely critical when it wasdecided to split the Grigg award into tv/o instalments.    In any case itis difficult to see how in logic there could be a distinguishable secondinstalment if we abandon Grigg in favour of a full scale revaluationeither by officials or by the National Board after an &quot;interim1 (i. e. first)payment.    We must also expect use to be made of the passa.ge in the1965 Defence White Paper (Cmnd. 2592, paragraph 6) that &quot;if our armed Forces are to attract and hold voluntary recruits, their pay and allowances will have to rise with wages and salaries in civilian life&quot;.8,       The Forces are already seriously overstretched, and the man-power situation is worrying.    Rates of recruitment and re-engagementare unsatisfactory and getting worse.    To take some examples;between I960 and 1965, the proportion of Naval ratings prepare *ed to signon after a nine-year engagement fell from 70 per cent to 25 per cent:the proportion of airmen prepared to extend their service has declinedby 65 per cent over the past two years: the man-power deficiency in both Royal Navy and Royal Air Force is expected to double during thenext two years: the Army has had to postpone until an unknown datehopes of recching its man-power ceiling, the recruiting rate havingfallen to some 16 per cent below target.    As a clear indication ofdissatisfaction with current conditions of service, the Army&apos;s rateof discharge by purchase has risen by 50 per cent since April, 1964.

5 w -3Applications for premature discharge are, of course, much higher,and the other two Services show a similar trend.    If on top of this werefuse to give the Services what they are entitled to we shall face a very grave situation, not merely in recruitment from civil life (which mustgo on whatever the size of Forces ultimately decided on) but alsoabout re-engagements of trained men which are vital to operational efficiency, particularly in the Navy.    I must also emphasis that theperiod in which it will be vital (and most difficult) to maintain morale and to continue to attract recruits will be the period of major disturbance-bance following the announcement of the Defence Review.    There willbe no possibility at all of maintaining recruiting if at the same time theForces believe themselves to be underpaid.recommendation .       I am prepared, if my colleagues feel it to be necessary to involve the National Board in some way, to accept that the more general question of how to determine Service pay after 1st April, 1966,might be referred to the Board.    But I must strongly resist any reference, or for that matter any other procedure, which would inter-fere with the normal working out and implementation of the currentbiennial review.D.H.Ministry of Defence, S. V7. 1.Gth November, 1965
