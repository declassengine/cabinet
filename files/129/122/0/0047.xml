The profession will note what the Royal Commission on the CivilService (1953-55) said of the Franks Committee:   &quot;Its findingsshould ... be advisory and not binding on the Government, though we think that it will be most unlikely that the Government will fail to take action when such a committee tenders advice&quot;.-1-confidential DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)66C.(65) 147 COPY NO. v_9th November, 1965CABINETDOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REMUNERATIONMemorandum by the Minister of health the remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National health service is due to be reviewed with effect from 1st April next when thecurrent three-year period for which the Government accepted therecommendations of the Review Body comes to an end.2.       The Review Body was set up on the recommendation of the RoyalCommission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration which reported inI960.    The Royal Commission referred to the precedent of the franks committee in making this recommendation.    Like the Franks Committee,it is appointed by and reports to the Prime Minister.    The presentChairman is Lord Kindersley and the other members (normally six) are drawn from academic, business, legal and actuarial fields.    One memberis, deliberately, also a member of the Franks Committee.     The review body has made one general report for the period 1963-66 and foursubsequent reports dealing with sections of the profession.    All havebeen accepted and implemented by the Government.3.       The Royal Commission^ intention, to which great importance was attached, was that, while the Review Body would be advisory only, itwould give the medical and dental professions confidence that their remuneration would be determined by considerations other than those ofpolitical convenience.    The purpose was to end the recurrent disputes between the professions and the Government over pay.    The Commissionbelieved that the Review Body would &quot;make recommendations of suchweight and authority that the Government will be able, and indeed feel bound, to accept them,u(l)4.      Rejection in whole or in part of the Franks Committeerecommendations would be regarded by the medical and dentalprofessions as a strong indication that their own Review Body&apos;srecommendations might suffer a similar fate.    It v/ould be difficult toavoid this implication.    General practitioners in particular would bedeeply disturbed.    There is a deep-seated feeling of unrest among them.Mass resignation v/as threatened because conditions in general practicehave grown increasingly difficult and the system of remuneration was such that it did not adequately recognise efforts to provide a better

service and the incidence of work load.    As a result of lengthy negotiations,a new basis for their contract designed tc secure a better service for patients and new methods of payment have recently been worked out.(These methods of payment in themselves carry no necessary implications for levels of pay).    The doctors have just agreed by a large majoritythat the new contract should go to the Review Body for pricing.    the doctors&apos; Charter demanded direct negotiation with the Government onlevels of payment and perhaps the most formidable difficulty in the entirenegotiations was to persuade the profession to accept reference of thisquestion to the Review Body.    As recently as 22nd September, after theyhad expressed alarm about the forecasts in the National Plan ofexpenditure on the family doctor service, I told them that the publicationof these figures would not affect the freedom of the Review Body to reachwhatever conclusions seemed right tc it.    The profession decided somemonths ago to retain in being the 18, 000 undated notices of resignationuntil after the Review Body has reported, and even accepted the defer-ment of advantageous reforms rather than destroy the resignations inadvance of the pricing.5.       Whether or not the doctors remain in the National Health Service -and so whether or not I can canry out my duty under the Act to provide theservice - now depends on the acceptability to them and to the Governmentof the Review Body&apos;s recommendations.    If they come to fear that these recommendations will be rejected or significantly modified by theGovernment they will conclude that our insistence on reference to the review Body was no more than a cynical delaying tactic.  In such a situation there would be renewed agitation among general practitionersto send in the resignations forthwith.ICR.Ministry of Health, S. S. 1.8th November, 1965-2-
