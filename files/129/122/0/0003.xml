THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1965C. (65) 10313th July, 1965CABINETFULL RECKONING OF UN ESTABLISHED CIVIL service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 14th January the Staff Side of the Civil Service national whitley Council asked me to authorise discussions on a scheme toallow all unestablished service to reckon in full for pension purposeson subsequent establishment. At present unestablished service reckonsin full on subsequent establishment if it was rendered after 14th July,1949; if rendered before that date it reckons as to one half. The claim is thus for a retrospective improvement in the reckoning of service before 1949, both for those already retired and for those still serving.2. This is a long standing claim which has been rejected several times in the past. To help reduce the cost in the early years, the staff side proposed a compromise solution as a basis for discussion,involving gradual implementation by a number of annual stages, awaiver of the recalculation of additional lump sums already paid on past retirements and a reasonable financial limit.3. The issue was discussed by the Social Services Committee on 7th July, together with the question of pensions increase for thepublic services. The Committee decided to recommend that pensions increase should have priority, and that I should inform the national staff Side at an appropriate moment that we could not give sufficientpriority to this claim to justify embarking on detailed negotiations,even for a phased scheme.The merits of the claim4. The Staff Side consider that the principle of full reckoninghas already been accepted. The Royal Commission on the CivilService, 1953-55, reported that in their view &quot; there was no questionof merit or principle outstanding &quot; and that &quot; the sole consideration was that of cost &quot;. The Staff Side also refer to the strong support forthe claim which was forthcoming from both sides of the House when a Motion was put down in 1960.5. Against this, however, at the time when the past temporaryservice was given there was in most cases no expectation that it wouldbe pensionable at all. In principle, too, it can be argued that it wouldCopy No.     5 95892
be wrong to reopen the conditions on which service was given manyyears ago. Acceptance of the claim would provide full reckoning notonly for temporary civil servants who had some prospect of establishment at the time, but also for the service of those (manynon-industrial civil servants and nearly all industrials) who wereunestablished and therefore unpensionable in principle, and for thewar service in the 1939-45 war of those who joined the Civil Serviceafter that war. (War service in the 1914-18 war does not count at all,and this is still a sore point with some pensioners.) Both kinds ofservice at present reckon as to one half. A good employer whointroduced a pension scheme for his manual workers some time after he had done so for his other staff would not normally give them morethan partial reckoning for previous service, and very few if anyemployers give reckoning for war service.Party policy. The Staff Side have referred to a document issued for thepurposes of the election, which many of our candidates quoted to staff representatives, and which stated that:&quot; Labour accepts the principle that all non-establishedservice should count for pension and will take steps, inconsultation with the appropriate bodies, to improve on theearlier reforms introduced by the last Labour Government in1946 and 1949.&quot;There was, of course, no undertaking as to the timing of any change,and I do not consider that we are bound to give priority to an expensive change in Civil Service superannuation over other parts ofour social programme.Cost7. Full reckoning for everybody, serving and retired, and including a recalculation of past lump sums, is out of the question.It would cost  310 million over a long period of years, of which about 38 million would be incurred in the first year ( 30 million of thiswould be for past lump sums). Thereafter, the annual cost would be 8 million in the second year, rising soon to about  9 million and remaining at that level for some years.A modified scheme8. I have therefore considered whether we could go some wayto meet the Staff Side and still keep costs within an acceptable limit.A number of possible variants, including the suggestions which theStaff Side themselves put forward, have been examined. I have however come to the conclusion that there is no compromise schemewhich would be likely to be accepted as fair and reasonable byserving staff and pensioners alike, and which could keep the cost toa level which we could contemplate over the next few years. A partialsettlement which could be afforded could perhaps be worked out.But it would undoubtedly produce more grievances than it would satisfy. We should thus come under heavy and immediate pressure
to improve it, and this pressure would be much harder to resist once the initial concession had been made.9. Apart from the direct costs, a concession to the Civil Servicemight stimulate somewhat analogous claims on behalf of other public services and nationalised industries where past service does notreckon or only reckons in part. It might also, though perhapsillogically, be compared unfavourably with the treatment of thoseexcluded from membership of the National Insurance scheme before1948 or too old to enter it then.Pensions-increase10. We shall need to consider in advance of the next Queen&apos;sSpeech proposals for a further measure to increase pensions in thepublic services generally. Such a measure would be costly but it willbe regarded as of greater priority than a measure to increase thepensions of a particular category of civil servants. Virtually all those with unestablished service before 1949 who have already retiredwould benefit from a new pensions increase measure.Conclusion11. I do not wish to reject this claim for all time as having nomerit. But we cannot satisfy this one group of Civil Service staff andpensioners in preference to doing something for pensioners generally,and the financial situation will not allow us to do both. I therefore ask my colleagues to endorse the recommendation of the social services Committee referred to in paragraph 3 above.12. The decision to put the claim for full reckoning into cold storage will be unpopular with the Staff Side especially in view of theRoyal Commission^ views and the statements made by many of ourmembers before the election. We shall probably be pressed, especially if we make clear that our decision is taken on grounds of cost andthe present financial situation, to promise action in two or threeyears&apos; time and meanwhile to negotiate a scheme to be put intooperation as soon as money permits. I must recommend that weshould not commit ourselves to this. There is, I am afraid, no reasonto expect the financial situation to be any easier in the near future,and the negotiation of a scheme would create powerful pressure toput it into operation immediately.13. I propose to see Mr. Hayward the Secretary-General ofthe National Whitley Council (Staff Side) and discuss the matter with him in the light of the Cabinefs conclusions.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,12th July, 1965.
