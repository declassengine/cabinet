DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 111 COPY NO.   jj ^23rd July, 1965CABINETADMISSION OF FOREIGN workers memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department at their meeting on 8th July the Cabinet invited me(C. C. (65) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3) -&quot;to keep under review the number of aliens accepted for permanent settlement in the United Kingdom and to bringthe matter before them if it appears that the average was likely to rise above 6, 000 a year&quot;.This reference to 6, 000 is to the number of aliens accepted for permanent residence after completing four years in employment approved by theMinistry of Labour,    I refer to them in this memorandum as &quot;workers&quot;.The present position2.      The number of foreign workers accepted for permanent residence in the first half of 1965 was 5, 660; the, total for 1965 may therefore be expected to be over 11, 000.    The tables in the annex tothis memorandum indicate how, as one might expect, the number offoreign workers accepted for permanent residence (shown in column (2))has fluctuated from year to year with the number of aliens admitted on long-term labour permits four years previously (shown in column (1)),although the proportion between the two figures is by no means constant.The exceptionally high number of long-term permit holders arriving inI960 and 1961 (over 30,000 in both years) has been reflected in the exceptionally high number of foreign workers who were accepted for permanent residence last year and who will be accepted this year.Since the number of such permit holders decreased considerably in1962-64, we may expect a similar decrease over the next three years inthe number of foreign workers who are eligible to settle in this country.Should numbers be restricted?3.     I have considered whether some numerical limit should be imposed on the number of foreign workers accepted for permanent residence in order to prevent invidious comparisons with the number ofvouchers issued to workers from the Commonwealth.    The figures which ought to be compared are the total numbers of commonwealth citizens on the one hand and aliens on the other accepted for settlement in any one year.    In 1964 there were 55,900 Commonwealth immigrants-1-

accepted for settlement (of whom 14,705 were voucher-holders) asagainst 19,211 aliens (of whom 9,195 were workers).    Even with commonwealth work vouchers restricted to 8,500 a year, it seems likely that the inflow of dependants of immigrants already settled here will keep the total volume of Commonwealth immigration at leastdouble that of alien immigration for several years tc come.    Thus i see no ground for invidious comparisons and no other reason to restrict the volume of alien immigration, which does not give rise toany special problems.4.     There would be some practical difficulties about restricting the number of foreign workers accepted for settlement.    If we wereto attempt to restrict the number of foreign workers settling in theUnited Kingdom, we would have either to reduce the number of long-term permits granted each year or to refuse permanent residence tosome who, under present practice, are qualified for it;    A reductionin the number of labour permits issued would put an unnecessaryobstacle in the way of the large proportion of aliens who come hereonly temporarily for employment but at the same time might nothave a proportionate effect on the number of those who decide toremain permanently.    A limit on the number of foreign workers to beaccepted for permanent residence would be difficult to enforce -since ultimately it might involve the deportation of the surplus who wished to remain.    It would moreover be contrary to the spirit of theCouncil of Europe Convention on Establishment, to which this countryis a signatory, and other international agreements on the free move-ment of workers.conclusion.     Accordingly, whilst we could do so, I do not recommend any action to restrict the number of foreign workers accepted for permanent residence.F. 3.Home Office, S. W. 1.23rd July, 1965-2-

In the heading of column (2) &quot;workers&quot; means aliens whohave spent four years in employment approved by the Ministry ofLabour.3. The estimated figures for 1965 in columns (2), (3) and (4)are arrived at by doubling the known figures for the first half of theyear.
