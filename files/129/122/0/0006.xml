CfTHE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER,FOR administration. The Government have decided to introduce legislation for the appoint-ment of a Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. This white paper explains the reasons for this decision and the role which they envisagefor the Commissioner.2. The interests of the citizen who is affected by a decision of centralGovernment are already safeguarded in a number of ways. He may have anopportunity of putting his case at an inquiry held before administrative action is taken. He may have a right of appeal to a tribunal against a decision. Hemay have a remedy before the courts.3. But these arrangements cannot cover every instance where a privateperson feels that he is suffering injustice as a result of faulty administration onthe part of a Government Department.4. We have examined the arrangements made for the scrutiny of suchindividual grievances in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand.The broad objective in each country has been the same, but in each case the detailed arrangements have been made to suit the particular circumstances ofthe particular country. In Britain, Parliament is the place for ventilating thegrievances of the citizen by history, tradition and past and present practice.It is one of the functions of the elected Member of Parliament to try to securethat his constituents do not suffer injustice at the hand of the Government.The procedures of Parliamentary Questions, Adjournment Debates and debates on Supply have developed for this purpose under the British pattern of Parlia-mentary government ; and Members are continually taking up constituents&apos;complaints in correspondence with Ministers, and bringing citizens&apos; grievances,great or small, to Parliament, where Ministers individually and Her Majcsty&apos;sGovernment collectively are accountable. We do not want to create any newinstitution which would erode the functions of Members of Parliament in thisrespect, nor to replace remedies which the British Constitution already provides.Our proposal is to develop those remedies still further. We shall give Membersof Parliament a better instrument which they can use to protect the citizen,namely, the services of a Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.5. Under our proposals, the Parliamentary Commissioner will be anindependent officer, whose status and powers will be conferred by statute. Hewill be appointed by the Crown ; his salary and pension will be a charge onthe Consolidated Fund ; and he will be secure from dismissal, except by parlia-mentary motion. He will report to Parliament each year, and otherwise as occasion requires.6. He will act only at the instance of a Member of the House of Commons,and on a complaint of personal injustice suffered by the complainant. It willbe for the Member to decide whether the complaint appears to be one appropriate for reference to the Commissioner. A complainant will not be restricted toapproaching the Member for his own constituency ; Members will doubtlessestablish their own conventions for ensuring that the constituency Member is kept in touch when another Member takes up a case.   Most complaints will
come from private individuals, but companies or other corporate bodies otherthan those under publicly elected or appointed authority will not be excluded.The Commissioner will be authorised to consider any complaint sent to himby a Member of Parliament from anyone lawfully resident in Great Britain or,so far as matters controlled by the Government in Westminster are concerned,in Northern Ireland. Visitors from abroad will be included if the complaintrelates to treatment received while lawfully present here. So will persons livingabroad if their complaint is about the administration of individuals&apos; rights orobligations arising here. But we do not intend that the Commissioner should cover complaints about our High Commissions, Embassies, Consular Offices orother posts of Her Majesty&apos;s Government abroad.7. Except for some exclusions which are explained later in this Paper, thefield for the Commissioner will be the whole range of relationships between theprivate person and the central Government. We propose to list in the statutethe bodies to be subject to investigation by the Commissioner in matters within his scope.   The proposed list is as follows : Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food ministry of AviationOffice of the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterCivil Service CommissionColonial office commonwealth Relations OfficeCustoms and ExciseMinistry of defence department of Economic AffairsDepartment of Education and ScienceExport Credits Guarantee DepartmentForeign OfficeGeneral Register OfficeGeneral Registry Office, ScotlandMinistry of HealthHome office ministry of Housing and Local GovernmentCentral Office of InformationInland RevenueMinistry of labour ministry of Land and Natural ResourcesLand RegistryLord Chancellors DepartmentOffice of the Lord Privy SealNational Assistance board national Debt OfficeOrdnance SurveyMinistry of Overseas DevelopmentPaymaster Generafs office ministry of Pensions and National InsuranceMinistry of PowerMinistry of Public Building and WorksPublic Record Office
Public TrusteeDepartment of Registers of ScotlandRegistry of Friendly SocietiesRoyal MintScottish Office :Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for ScotlandScottish Development department Scottish Education department Scottish Home and Health department Scottish Record OfficeH.M. Stationery office ministry of TechnologyBoard of trade ministry of TransportTreasuryTreasury Solicitors DepartmentOffice of the Minister without PortfolioWelsh Office.It has been agreed that the Crown Estate Office shall be included too. So alsowill the Post Office as regards its functions relating to national savings and to thecontrol of broadcasting and wireless telegraphy or as the agent of any body which is itself subject to the Commissioner. The list will need to be amendedfrom time to time as the structure of the government machinery itself is changed,and we shall seek power to do this by subordinate instrument.8. The exclusions which we propose to make from the Commissionersfield of investigation are those where there are dominant considerations ofnational or public interest namely, the exercise of powers to preserve the safety of the State ; matters which Ministers certify as affecting relations with othercountries ; matters relating to the administration of colonial territories ; andthe exercise of powers in relation to investigating crime or determining whethera matter shall go to the courts. The Commissioner will not normally pursuematters which are within the competence of the courts ; he will have discretion to act if he thinks that the remedy open in the courts is not one which the complainant could reasonably be expected to use, but this will not affectanyone&apos;s right of access to the courts. He will not pursue issues already coveredby tribunals or other quasi-judicial bodies, or by the Council on Tribunals andits Scottish Committee of both of which he himself will be an ex officiomember. Nor will he look into the exercise of the Prerogative of Mercy orinto the exercise of the personal authority of the Sovereign in conferring honoursand privileges, or into appointments by the Crown or by Ministers. He will be excluded from investigating actions of Departments in personnel matters,including orders and discipline in the Armed Forces. Finally, purely com-mercial relationships of Departments with customers or suppliers will not come within his purview.9. We intend the Commissioners procedure to be as informal as possible,subject to the requirement that if he takes up a case he must give to the personagainst whom the complaint lies the opportunity to comment on it. He willbe empowered to decide whether the parties can be legally represented, but legalrepresentation will be the exception, not the rule. Legal aid will not be available.
The Commissioner will be able to call for oral or written evidence ; and hewill have power to compel production of documents, including departments&apos;minutes, but excluding Cabinet or Cabinet Committee documents. He willhave power to take evidence on oath, although we would expect this power tobe used infrequently. In this connection the sanction to be invoked in the eventof defiance of the Commissioner will be to refer the matter to the High Court,or in Scotland to the Court of Session, or in Northern Ireland to the SupremeCourt of Justice, for consideration as if it were contempt of that Court.10. The Commissioner will have discretion to refuse to pursue a case where he thinks there are insufficient grounds for the complaint or where he does not regard it as within his scope. He will not normally pursue a case where thematter complained of had been known to the complainant more than twelvemonths previously but he will have discretion to do so.11. The Commissioner will be concerned with faults in administration. Itwill not be for him to criticise policy, or to examine a decision on the exerciseof discretionary powers, unless it appears to him that the decision has been affected by a fault in administration. If he finds nothing wrong, he will informthe Member of Parliament who has approached him. If he finds that there isjustifiable cause for complaint and the Department responds to his invitation to put it right, he will inform the Member. So far as the Commissioner isconcerned, this will be the end of the matter, save for a possible reference tothe case in his annual report to Parliament. If the Department do not act tothe Commissioners satisfaction, it will be open to him to report his conclusion to Parliament ad hoc.12. It will be for Parliament to decide what arrangements to make to receiveand act upon reports from the Commissioner. This will not be a matter for legislation. !t may well be found convenient to establish a Select Committeeto take these reports in the first instance. This Committee would have theusual powers of a Select Committee to summon witnesses (including Ministers)and to take evidence and report to Parliament.13. It will be for Parliament, with the help of this Committee (if one is appointed), to consider what action should be taken on the reports of theCommissioner whether the annual report, or reports ad hoc. The Commis-sioner in his annual report may comment on defects in the system which have come to his notice as a result of investigating individual complaints.14. We do not intend that a reference to the Commissioner should auto-matically hold up action on the case by the Government ; sometimes this might be contrary to the public interest. Ministers will have discretion toproceed with a case even where it is being examined by the Commissioner.They will also have discretion to prevent disclosure of information by theCommissioner where the safety of the State or the public interest makes itnecessary to do so.15. The fact that we are proposing this scheme does not mean that wethink that the administration of Government departments is open to serious criticism or that injustices are frequently suffered by individual citizens. Farfrom it.   We are in no doubt that the tradition of integrity and impartiality in
our public administration is being fully maintained. But our proposal should increase confidence in that administration by enabling complaints aboutadministrative action to be fully and impartially investigated, so that, if a grievance is justified, it may be remedied, or, if it is unjustified, this may be demonstrated. It should also result, as has proved to be the case in othercountries, in the further improvement of administrative standards and efficiency.16. In formulating our proposals we have paid regard to two importantprinciples. First, that this new institution should serve to develop and reinforceour existing constitutional arrangements for the protection of the individual.Secondly, that the scope of the scheme must be made as clear as possible, sothat everybody may know as plainly as may be what cases the commissioner will be able to take up and what their rights and obligations will be in relationto his inquiries.17. In due course, it may be desirable to consider extending the powers ofthe Commissioner to deal with complaints of the private citizen against theadministrative actions of other public authorities. But, first, we intend to seekexperience of the Commissioner in the field of relationships between the citizenand central Government.S53770  Wt. 11M28   91   7/65  St.S.
