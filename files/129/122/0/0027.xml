JibDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)14th September, 1965CABINETLOCAL, GOVERNMENT FINANCE - THE GRANT system memorandum by the Minister of health the Chancellor of the exchequer;:; memorandum (C.(65) 125)records the proposals of the Ministerial Committee on Local government finance and invites the Cabinet to decide whether, within the totalExchequer contribution on the lines of the scheme set out, there shouldbe specific grants for health and welfare and some other services inaddition to the specific grant proposed for education.2.       Local health and welfare services are partly services to preventill-health, partly services designed to help keep the sick and elderlywithin the community.    They perform a major social function to which weas a party have always attached great importance.    I have recently asked the local authorities to review their plans for these services over thenext 10 years.3.       Since general grant was introduced, expenditure on the local health services and latterly on the welfare service has been treated in thesame way as expenditure on education.    Under the proposed scheme thisparity of treatment would be lost unless a specific grant for health and welfare is included.    Paragraph 26 of the chancellor s memorandummakes the point that, even with a 50 per cent grant for education, it may take time for the novel implications of the new proposals to be appreciatedby the local authorities.    I am in no doubt that, without any specific grant for health and welfare, the inevitable inference that many local authorities would draw is that these services were the poor relation to which less importance was attached by the Government and to which they for their part could attach less importance also.    It would certainly be seen asflatly inconsistent with our Manifesto pledge that v/e would give a newimpetus to these services.4.      The chancellor,^ memorandum says in paragraph 17 that the&quot;prestige&quot; argument for specific grants is inadmissible under the new system.    That system could, no doubt, work without a specific educatioxigrant, but, by including one in the proposals, we should be givingeducation de facto a favoured status among local services.    Once thisbreach is made we cannot, I submit, refuse to concede the claim of health and welfare to similar status or &quot;prestige&quot;, in the eyes of localauthorities.5.      Paragraph 17 of the Chancellor&apos;s memorandum also argues that a specific grant for health and welfare is less needed than is an educationgrant to help secure an equitable distribution of the total Exchequer aidby ironing out inequities in distribution, because the total expenditure onthese services is much smaller.    I accept, of course, that the amount ismuch smaller, but at an estimated  200 million a year it is by no means-1-SECRET

9-! i?&apos;s5 X Unegligible, and although the measures of need are necessarily crude (as indeed are those for education), there is undoubtedly a wide disparity inthe needs of different local areas for health and welfare services.6.       The point in paragraph 24 of the memorandum that the total amount of specific grants should be limited in order to maintain the effectiveness of the rates support grant is an important one, and I haveno desire to challenge it.    It is not, however, an argument against theextension of specific grants to particular services.    The size of the ratessupport grant can be maintained at the appropriate level, without unfairlyexcluding from specific grant services that have proper claims to treat-ment similar to that given to education, by fixing the rate of specificgrant at a percentage which will secure that result - if necessary at, say,40 per cent or even 45 per cent rather than 50 per cent.7.       If health and welfare were excluded from specific grant and localauthorities were, as I fear, discouraged in consequence from developingtheir health and welfare services, it would, as my colleagues know, benecessary to make alternative provision, which v/ould be more expensiveand often socially less appropriate, through the Exchequer-financedhospital service.8.       I ask my colleagues, therefore, to support the inclusion in thenew system of a specific grant for health and welfare similar to that proposed for education.Ministry of Health, S.E. 1.14th September, 1965-2-
