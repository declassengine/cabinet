ATji-TEX, AMonday, 1st November, 1965STATEHESB? BY THE PllXiB KPIISTERv7ith pernission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on rhodesia,The House vd.ll recall that, following the break-up of the central african Federation in 19^3, there havebeen continuing discussions on thequestion of independence for Ehodesia, and in particular on the terns onwhich Her Majesty1 s Government could recommend Parliament to pass thenecessary legislation.     For it cannot be too clearly stated that inde-pendence for Rhodesia can cone only by the authority of this Parliament.In pursuance of the discussions which began in September, 196&quot;A, &quot;theright hon. Gentleman, the then Prime Minister, and his colleagues hadthorough and frank discussions with the Prime Minister of Rhodesia.     Inthose discussions the then British Government made clear three things.One, any unilateral declaration clainingindependence would be invalid,illegal and indeed a revolt against the Crown,    Two, that while thediscussions should start fron the 1961 Rhodesian Constitution, that had notin fact teen devised as an Independence Constitution (the EhodesianGovernment contest this statement) and there must be sufficiently represent-ative institutions as a condition of the grant of independence toKhodesia, a view which was endorsed by the 19&amp;4 Commonwealth PrimeMinisters1 Meeting.     Third, the then Government nade clear that whateversettlement was rea.ched as a basis for Independence must be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.This was the position at the time of the change of Government inBiitain, and Her Majesty1s Government have in fact consistently followed the principles laid down by our predecessors and sought to give effect tothen.     On 15th October last year, Polling Day, the then Government rejectedMr, Smith1s suggestion that the judgment of the forthconing indaba ofRhodesian chiefs could be taken as indicating the views of the Rhodesianpeople as a whole.On taking office we confirmed that rejection,The House will recall that in view of evidence that a UnilateralIndependence Declaration was imminent, the Government issued on27th October, 19&amp;4 a statement on the legal, constitutional and economic consequences of such a step,,    The House will recall also that when, inApril this year, in the course of the Rhodesian election doubts were thrown on the inplication of that statement, I nade a further statement in this house on 29th April this year.

&quot;        /S Q OI will not weary the House with all the details of my exchanges,       LJi is iywritten and oral, with the Prime Minister of Rhodesia0     But it rail he recalled that after written exchanges, I met Mr. Smith when he cane toLondon to attend the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill and that shortly afterwards my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and my right lion. friend the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations visited Rhodesia for discussions with the Government there and with representative leaders of allshades of opinion.Following that visit exchanges continued by letter and orally throughthe British High Commissioner in Salisbury - and I cannot find wordsadequate to pay tribute to his work through all this time - on the basisof five principles which Her Majesty&apos;s G-overnment considered must berealised before independence must be granted, and which Mr. Smith accepted..These principles, as the House knows, were:-(l)   The principle and intention of unimpeded progress to majority rule,already enshrined in the 1961 Constitution, would have to be maintained and guaranteed,(2)   There would also have to be guarantees against retrogressive amendmentof the Constitution.(3)   There would have to be immediate improvement in the political status of the African population.(4-)   There would have to be progress towards ending racial discrimination.(5)   The British Government would need to be satisfied -that any basisproposed for independence was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole,A fuller statement on the position which Her Majesty&apos;s Government havetaken up on these principles was in fact published by my right hon Friend8sDepartment on 9th October, after the breaking-off of the recent Londontalks, and for the convenience of the House I propose to circulate that statement in the Official Report.In furtherance of the discussions on these principles, my,hon friend the Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations in July visited Rhodesiafor further discussions and after further written and oral exchangesMr. Smith came to London for talks aimed at producing a final settlement ofthe points at issue.     After talks lasting four days, from 5th to3th October, it became clear that no agreement was in sight, and an agreedcommunique was issued saying so     The statement of 9th October to whichI have referred set out in more detail the points at issue and I will not take up the time of the House going over the material in that statements

-3-SECRET     nAlthough we failed to reach agreement on the means of giving effect to every one of the five principles, I would particularly draw the House&apos;attention to our insistence that guaranteed and unimpeded progress tomajority rule should not he frustrated by the freedom of an independentRhodesia to amend the 19^1 Constitution in a retrogressive sense.   In thisconnection the House will he aware cf a singular feature in that Constitu-tion, in that while certain Constitutional safeguards are entrenched, other provisions - including even the numbers of members of Parliament to be elected on the &quot;A&quot; roll and &quot;B&quot; roll respectively - are not entrenched and,on a two-thirds Parliamentary majority could be altered in such a way ascompletely to frustrate the spirit of the Constitution and the prospects oforderly progress to majority rule.   Equally, in the London talks, there wasno agreement at all on the means of giving effect to the over-riding fifthprinciple that the British G-overnment and the British Parliament must besatisfied that the terms for independence are acceptable to the Rhodesianpeople as a whole.Despite the breakdown, I made clear to Mr. Smith on the day of his departure, and my right hon. Friend reconfirmed v/hen he saw him off atLondon Airport, that we 7/ere prepared to continue the discussions.   Therewere of course a number of proposals which deserved further consideration,including our proposal of a Constitutional Conference, Mr. Smith1s proposalfor a Senate to vote on constitutional matters - though, on his formulation,only on the entrenched clauses - and the proposal which came up very late inthe day for a Treaty between the British and the Government of Rhodesia toprovide the necessary safeguards.As the House knows, exchanges continued, including those covering my proposal for a Commonwealth Mission to be headed by Sir Robert Menzies which mr. Smith rejected.   On the 20th of October, Mr. Smith sent me an urgentletter, which hon. Members will have seen and which many hon. Members willhave regarded as being in the nature of an ultimatum, demanding our immediateacceptance of independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitution combined with a Treaty on the lines suggested by Mr. Smith.   Following my visit to salisbury I must tell the House that I am in no doubt that a U.D.I. v/would have followed the Governments rejection of that demand, for I am sure theHouse would never have agreed to our accepting it.As the House knows, I replied saying that I proposed to come to salisbury to continue the discussions with the rhodesian Government and tohave talks with all - including African Nationalist Leaders - whom I feltcould help.   Accordingly, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Common-wealth Secretary scud by kon., Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Overseas Development, who went for the purpose of discussing anintensified education programme with Rhodesian Ministers, I left for

A H iSalisbury on the 2kth of Ootoher.   I should perhaps add that in the course ofmy journey? more than 13*000 miles, I discussed the Pdiodesian and of courseother questions with the Presidents of Kenya, Zambia and Ghana and the PrimeMinister of Nigeria, (while my right hon. Friend had visited Tanzania andKenya).   The House will recognise that, although Britain alone carries theresponsibility and the trust, there are other people to consider, not onlythe peoples of Britain and of Rhodesia, but also the Commonwealth, and indeed the United Nations as a whole.For my talks in Salisbury I was joined by my hon. and learned Friend the attorney-General.   In all I had talks spread over four days, and coveringpractically every minute of those four days with the Government of rhodesia and with leaders of all sections of Rhodesian opinion.   In all, my talkscovered nine and a half hours with Mr. Smith, alone, or with his colleagues,and in one case, with the whole Cabinet:   twenty-nine hours in separatemeetings with other leaders of opinion, including three long meetings withMr. Nkomo and his colleagues, three with Mr. Sithole and his colleagues, andone meeting with Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Sithole together.   In all, serious talks with 126 leading and representative Rhodesians.No-one, British or Rhodesian, has been able to hear the views of so many leaders of opinion, African or European, for very many years.   before i come to the crucial meetings with the Rhodesian Government and describe the state at which the discussions now stand, I should tell the house that in my talks with the African Nationalist leaders, and with african and other M.P.s elected on the &quot;B&quot; roll, I made clear, with absolutefrankness, three things.   First, I regarded it as my duty to remove fromtheir minds any idea of hope they might have that Rhodesia1 s consti-tutional problems were going to be solved by an assertion of millitary power on our part, whether for the purposes of suspending oramending the 1961 Constitution, of imposing majority rule tomorrowor any other time - or for that matter of dealing with the situation that would follow, an illegal assertion of independence.      To quote-h-S EC RET      *\

-5-SECRET   nA *1 9the words I used to them,&quot;If there are those who are thinking in terms of a thunderbolt hurtlingfrom the sky and destroying their enemies, a thunderbolt in the shape of the Royal Air Force, let me say that thunderbolt will not becoming, and to continue in this delusion wastes valuable time, andmisdirects valuable energies.&quot;Secondly, I said that,&quot;Although successive British G-overnnents are deeply and irrevocablycommitted to guaranteed and unimpeded progress to majority rule, theBritish Government who alone through the British Parliament, have thelegal power to grant independence, do not believe that in the presentand tragic and divided condition of Rhodesia, that majority can or should come today, or tomorrow.     A period of time is needed, timeto remove the fears and suspioions between race and race, time to showthat the Constitution of Rhodesia with whatever amendments may laterbe made, can be worked, aid. is going to be worked, and that the rule of law, equally with the maintenance of essential human rights, willbe paramount.     And the time required cannot be measured by clock orcalendar, but only by achievement.&quot;Thirdly, I urged them to unite the at present bitterly divided forcesof African opinion, to work the Constitution of Rhodesia in a constitutionalmanner, to persuade their followers to register and to vote;   I urged then to stand for Parliament and to show to Rhodesia, to ourselves and the world,that they and the others concerned could make a reality of a multi-racialParliament, with a system of multi-racial government, as long as possible before and of course indefinitely after majority rule.     And let it be clear,such an achievement is going to require a very painful surrender of prejudice,a very substantial eating of words, by a lot of people, African and european alike.Now I turn to the discussions with the Government.     Every issue v/asexhaustively discussed and there is no question which has not been fullythrashed out.     And I want the House to know that no-one in authority in rhodesia can now be in any doubt of the dire consequences, legal,constitutional or economic, of an illegal seizure of power.     Indeed, I would hope that no-one in Rhodesia at all, following my statement to a newsconference (which, if the Houses wish, I will place in the Library) would now be in any doubt of the position.     For the House must realise thatRhodesia today is not only hyper-charged with emotion, particularly theemotion of fear, it is - Europeans and Africans alike - characterised by an extraordinary degree of self-deception.

-6-There were no threats.     There were warnings, not only of the action we should have to take, but ny assessment of the international reactionand of the steps that might be taken, and taken irrespective of anythingwe might do, by the United Nations or by other African countries.On the issues we discussed, it became quite clear that the proposalfor the Treaty is not a runner,     Y.re were fully prepared to discuss itin depth, and my hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General flew outspecially for this, but it became clear that it plays no real part inRhodesian thinking.     They and we agree that constitutional safeguardsshould be entrenched in a Constitution, not a Treaty.     Moreover, even ifa Treaty were regarded as an appropriate vehicle, we should still need toagree on its contents, including the problem of the unentrenched clauses.The Treaty idea, therefore, is dead, and we agreed to pursue thediscussions on the basis of amendments to be made now to the 1961Constitution.Sir, by last Friday morning we had made no progress, indeed there wereominous signs not only of a breakdown of the discussions, but of imminentaction.In these circumstances I put to the Rhodesian Prime Minister twopropositions.     The first of these stemmed from Mr. Smith&apos;s repeatedassertion that the Rhodesian people, including a majority of Africans,wanted independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitution.     I proposedto him that this should be tested by a referendum of the whole Rhodesianpeople, whether on universal suffrage, or perhaps on the basis of thepresent electorate plus the majority of Africans whom Mr. Smith has proposed should now be added to the &quot;B&quot; roll voters on the single test of whether they pay taxes.     There would have to be safeguards, includinginternational, presumably British, supervision guarantees againstintimidation from either side, and freedom for lawful, constitutionalpolitical organisation and canvassing.     This would show whether Mr. Smithwas right or whether those were right, European and African, who saidthat the country would be opposed to independence on Mr. Smith&apos;s terms.

-     474The second proposition was that Her Majesty should be recommended bythe Governments both of Britain and Pdiodesia to set up a Royal Commission,under the chairmanship of Rhodesia&apos;s Chief Justice, to recommend the amendments to the 196d Rhodesia Constitution which would provide the basis on which Rhodesia may proceed to independence as rapidly as possible in a manner giving effect to the principles enunciated by the British Governmentin our statement of the 9th October, 1965, and v/hich at the same time wouldbe acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.     &quot;kVhat was envisagedfirst v/as that the Royal Commission in addition to taking formal evidenceshould be free to make informal contacts to reach agreement on an acceptableindependence constitution.     Secondly it would need to recommend how its proposals could be shown to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as awhole.     what I had in mind was that the Commission should continue the informal consultation, should continue the work we had begun in breakingdown the apparently irreconcilable and intransigent positions of thoseinvolved.     For in fact what we were doing last week, and v/hat the commission would continue, was to hold a running and informal constitutional conference,in place of the foimal conference referred to in this year&apos;s commonwealth prime iHnisters1 Conference communique, but which in present circumstances,as I promptly told those who pressed it on me, would be a meaninglessgesture.Both propositions were later put by me to the African leaders.     OnFriday evening my colleagues and I met the full Rhodesian Cabinet.     while accepting neither of my two alternatives they came forward v/ith a proposalv/hich, in fact, represented a combination of them.     They agreed on a royal Commission, under the chairmanship of the Chief Justice and proposedthat one member should be nominated by the Rhodesian Government, one by her Majesty&apos;s Government, the three to work on the basis of a unanimousreport.     Instead of the Commission proceeding from the 196&apos;1 Constitutiontowards an entirely new Constitution which would be generally acceptable,they proposed that it should work on a narrower canvas, namely to receive from the two Governments an agreed draft independence arrangement, based onthe 1961 Constitution with such amendments as we might consider necessary;and then to ascertain whether such a document was or was not acceptable tothe Rhodesian people as a whole.I believe this v/as a helpful, not to say ingenious combination of ourown proposals, though I should make it clear that we reserve our position on two main points,     First, on our right to revert to our original concept of the Commission^ powers and. duties, not least if the Commission reportedfailure or could not agree, working on the narrower terms of reference.Second, on balance we feel, and we reserved our position on this, that itmight be more consistent with the responsibility which the two Governmentscarry in this matter for the Commission to produce an interim report to the-7-S EC RET

A 7 Ktwo Governments on the methods they recommend for consulting Rhodosxanopinion as a whole, and if these were accepted by the Government, to go onto supervise the consultation progress.I believe that, subject to these reservations, v/e now have a way inwhich given goodwill and ordinary plain common sense it is possible tosettle the problem on a basis acceptable to the Rhodesian people, toParliament and I believe to world opinion.     Procedurally, at least, thereis nothing to prevent an agreed settlement, and we have provided for the realisation of the fifth principle.But the House will realise there is one outstanding difficulty.     Wehave still to agree - as we would have h-ad under a Treaty, or on any other basis - on the content of the document which, after approval, by the twoGovernments which the Commission v/ould put to the peoples of Rhodesia.My right hon. Friend and my hon. and learned Friend stayed on in Salisburyto seek agreement.     They are now on their way back to report, but I haveto tell the House that there c.re still important differences.     The principalissues include the doctrine of the so-called blocking third or blockingquarter for amendments to the constitution of clauses which are notentrenched and provision of effective safeguards for the specially entrenchedclauses.     The Rhodesian Government proposal to augment the elected african members for this purpose by a number of hereditary chiefs, paid by the rhodesian Government simply will not do.     I have seen the chiefs.     Theycannot by the widest stretch of imagination be said bo be capable of representing the African population as a whole.Equally I am sure the House v/ould feel that we cannot leave withoutsafeguards a situation which would permit, amongst other things, anindependent Rhodesian Parliament, without check or constitutional hindranceto reduce the &quot;B&quot; roll seats from 15 to 1 or to increase to 100 the &quot;A&quot; Roll seats, and thus postpone for many more years the achievement of majority rule.We have still to reach agreement.     With the necessary goodwill, I donot see why   we should not.I simply cannot believe, now wo have got so far, that the rhodesian government or anyone else in their senses, could reject an agreed and constitutional means of resolving this problem and embark on the dangerous .lunacy cf an illegal declaration, with all that would follow.     The way is open, given the will, and now only those - and there are those - who want aU.D.I. for its own sake, or who in their hearts reject the ultimate purposeof tho 1961 Constitution and of the five principles on which Mr. Smith andI have agreed to base all our discussion, could now contemplate illegal andunconstitutional action.-8-secret   %

Sir, I hope the House will concede that I have done everything in aman&apos;s power to avert the tragic and dangerous development which only ten days ago was imminent, and cannot even now he said to have been removed, andto carry through the consultations necessary to any long-term solution.     i hope hon. Members will agree that as a result of those ten days we can saythat the door is wide open to an acceptable,agreed, and constitutionalsolution, that there is no case for - that we in Britain, end the rest of theworld, could not now understand, still loss condone - an attempt to solveBhodesian problems by illegal and unconstitutional means.     And I hope theywill agree that we have reached this situation without any retreat from theprinciples which all Parties in this House have proclaimed, without anysurrender of that position of trust which we hold and must hold for the peoples - all the peoples of Rhodesia.     For that is a trust which wo cannotmorally escape or seek to evade;   it is inescapably ours until we hand overto an independent Rhodesia not only our powers and responsibilities but alsoour trusteeship, on terms and on conditions which will ensure that, in letter and in spirit, the principles which have inspired that trusteeship willendure.-9-SEGRET

REPORT TO THE BRITISH AID RHODESIAH G0VEaNHEIIJ3EIDERSTBSNCS OF RHODESIAPROPOSED ROYAL commission.      At   the meeting of British Ministers and the Rhodesian Cabinetcn 29th October, the two Prime Ministers discussed proposals for anIndependence Constitution for Rhodesia which might be put before a RoyalCommission to be appointed to ascertain whether such proposals would be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.   The Prime Minister of rhodesia maintained that any such proposals must be acceptable to theGovernment of Rhodesia; and the British Prime Minister accepted the importanceof this.   The two Prime Ministers agreed that the Commonwealth secretary with the Attorney-General and Rhodesians Ministers should explore theextent of agreement on such proposals which can be reached and shouldidentify the points of disagreement.2.     The results ef our discussion are as follows -(a)   Ordinary Constitutional amendmentsRhodesian po.s:LjdpnThe Rhodesian Government consider that the present provision thatthe clauses of the constitution, ether than those specially entrenched, may be amended by a two-thirds majority in theLegislative Assembly should be continued into the Independenceconstitution unaltered.British position the British Ministers suggested that, while this two-thirdsprovision should be maintained, the B Roll seats in theLegislative Assembly should be increased to provide a&quot;blocking third&quot; for the amendment of those clauses,   This proposals is unacceptable to the Rhodesian Ministers.03)   Amendment of the specially entrenchsd_cla.uao3Rhodesian position the Rhodesian Ministers regard the present provision for amendmentof the specially entrenched clauses by four racial referenda asunworkable.   They would however allow this provision to continue in the Independence Constitution provided an acceptablealternative was introduced for the present arrangements,set out in Section 109, whereby in lieu of these referenda a Billmaybe submitted to Her Majesty for assent.   The RhodesianMinisters propose that, in place of this procedure, a House of1-2 Chiefs should be established which would vote with the assembly on the third reading of-any Bill seeking to amend the specially entrenched clauses. The Rhodesian Ministers consider that the12 Chiefs, added to the existing 15 B Roll members, would provide apredominantly African &quot;Blocking Third&quot;.(1)SECRET N

Britiglo^F^ositipjiThe British Ministers do not regard these proposals as providing an acceptable substitute for the present Section 109 procedure and point outthat the sole constitutional safeguard vrcmld be a margin of two votes.The;/ suggest alternative procedures for the amendment of specially entrenched clauses, to replace the two alternative procedures in thepresent constitution.The first of these would require that a Bill to amend a specially&quot;entrenched clause should receive a two-thirds majority in- the LegislativeAssembly and should then be submitted to a referendum of the electorate,provided that the electorate on the B Roll had been increased to include,say all adult taxpaj-ers.The alternative procedure vrould be that an amending Bill shouldreceive a three-quarters majority in the Legislative Assembly, provisionhaving been made for an inorease in the 3 Roll seats to pi*provide a&quot;Blocking Quarter&quot;.   Thereafter, before the Bill became law, a fixed time should elapse during which the validity of the Bill would be challenged byany Rhodesian on the grounds (a) that the 3ill discriminated or had theeffect of discriminating unjustly between the races (b) that it failedto pay proper respect to the rights and freedoms of the individual.   Thequestion of the validity of the Bill would be determined by the AppellateDivision of the high Court of Rhodesia with an appeal as of right fromthe decision of that court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.The rhodesian Ministers find the first of these alternative procedures(i.e. approval by a two-thirds majority followed by a referendum)unacceptableThey are prepared to consider the second alternative, provided the additionaltwo seats necessary to enlarge the B Roll to a Blocking Quarter are filled by Chiefs, who on appointment to the legislature -would cease toreceive any Chiefs&apos; subsidies, and provided the reference to the High Courtis strictly limited to the question whether the Bill &quot;discriminates unjustlybetween the races&quot;.The British Ministers consider that the additional two seats on theB Roll should he filled by members elected on the B Roll.Addad^i^^tp^he ^ S 2 ^iL^Bi^^2^^2^^BS.Rhodesian positionentrenchment of any clauses in the present constitution, with the possiblesingle exception referred to below.The Rhodesian Ministers are not prepared to agree to the further

British position the British Ministers suggest the special entrenchment of chapter III of the constitution which is not now specially entrenched inthe constitution.   This Chapter relates to the delimitation and number of constituencies at electoral districts.   Without ssuph special entrenchment,it would he possible, by a two-thirds majority, to amend the clausesgoverning the number of A or B Roll seats.The Rhedesian Ministers cannot accept the special entrenchment ofthese clauses,  They would, however, agree to the special entrenchment ofthe provisions governing the total number of B Roll Seats, provided a&quot;fade-out&quot; arrangement was introduced into the Independence Constitution,tinder which any reduction in 3 Roll seats would be dependent on non-Europeans winning A Roll seats.   The Rhodesian proposal, is that for eachA Roll seat won by a non-European, a B Roll seat should be abolished.   Thisis unacceptable to the British Ministers.   They consider that if anarrangement of this Icind were to be introduced, it ought at least to provide that two A Roll seats would have to be won by non-Europeans before aB Roll seat was abolished.   Additionally,the British Ministers have doubts about this proposal on practical grounds e.g. the difficulty of definitionor of subsequent electoral reversal.The FranchiseRhodesian positionProvided the remaining provisions of the constitution satisfied their requirements, the Rhodesian Minister would be willing to extend the Franchiseon the B Roll to qualified indigenous adult taxpayers.Provided the remaining provision of the constitution satisfied their requirements, and subject to the reasonableness of the proposed qualification,the British Ministers would accept this.Rhodasian and British Ministers are satisfied that no serious problems are raised by the sequence of amendments, of a consequentialnature, which would be necessary to convert the 1961 Constitution Into anIndependence Constitution.Submission of this reportBritish positionBritishIt is agreed that this joint report will be submitted by the.sh and Rhodesian Ministers to their respective Governments.

SECRET .        a anLl o uANNEX copy OF A LETTER FROM THE fflG-H, COjfflSSIfjpiROF,,RHODESIA, TO THE PRIME MINISTERX X 36-I have &quot;been asked by my Prime Minister to give you tho followingmessage -&quot;From Rhodesian Prime Minister to British Prime Minister,31st October, 1965.The talks ended here this morning without managing to bring the two sides any closer.   After you departed no progress was made, I regret toreport.As we agreed here on Friday night, there is no point in the RoyalCommission starting, unless the proposed constitution is acceptable to the rhodesian Government.   Otherwise, the exercise would be a useless one.Even though our proposals nay not completely satisfy the BritishGovernment, I believe that we should now leave it to an impartialarbitrator - the proposed Royal Commission - to determine whether our proposals are acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.   If theCommission finds in the affirmative, then, hi all justice, no one will haveairy right to stand in our way.I would remand you that last year I made an agreement with yourpredecessor that Rhodesia could have Independence on the 196l Constitution,if it could be proved that this was acceptable to the people of rhodesia  a whole.   Unfortunately, we differed over the mechanics of testing publicopinion in Rhodesia.   Under this proposed scheme the Rhodesian Governmenthas agreed to additional liberal concessions in your favour.Therefore, if you are unwilling to accept the proposal now put to you,this means that you are departing, in principle, from the agreement whichI made with your predecessor last year.   As for the mechanics of carryingout the exercise, we have already agreed that this should be a RoyalCommission.   Hence we have overcome the difficulty which arose betweenyour predecessor and myself.&quot;Message ends.ac       x       x

iWiTELJDMEETING- AT 8.00 ?.m. ON WEDNESDAY, 9th SEPTEMBER, 19&amp;Hjr^Jfeiith said he might he able - he hoped he would be - to go further in the direction of some sort of referendum than his ovaa original proposal had contemplated.     But he could not go as far as &quot;one nan, one vote&quot;.&quot;If I were thought to have conceded this, I should be out&quot;.The Prime Minister said that we adhered to what wo had said hiParliament, in particular that sufficiently representative institutionswould be a condition of the grant of independence.     But, if the G-overnmentof Southern Rhodesia could produce - and we very much doubted that theycould - evidence clearly showing that the people of Southern Rhodesiaconsidered that they already had sufficiently representative institutions,a new situation &quot;would arise, which we should have to consider on its merits.He repeated that we should, have to consider it;   we should still not be committed to grant independence.The Commonwealth Secretary; agreed, that, if Mr. Smith could prove - andhe underlined the Prime Minister&apos;s scepticism on this point - that the africans would accept the present constitution without any enlargement of representative institutions, it would be very difficult for us to do otherthan to acquiesce.Mr. Smith replied that, even so, he must be clear whether, if hedemonstrated to our satisfaction that the Africans ^70uld accept the present constitution, he would still bo liable to be refused independence until agreater degree of African representation was permitted.     If he were stillliable to be challenged on this point, that would bo the end of it so faras he was concerned.The PrimeLjhfiister said that he should then presumably be back to a unilateral declaration of independence,Mr...Smith confirmed this was so.The ffiime Minister said that, nevertheless, we should not reach this situation until the process of ascertaining African opinion had beencompleted, to our satisfaction:   but he was anxious that Mr. Smith should be under no illusions that;.we might have to say, when the time came, that itwas not to our satisfaction.-i-

The Commonwej^th3^PT^2^2. said that if, contrary to our expectations,we were convinced that African opinion had been fully consulted and supportsthe present constitution, it seemed unlikely that we should, bo able to insist on the Africans being given a greater degree of representation,which they would have themselves indicated that they did not want.That would not be the main difficulty.     The main difficulty would be muchmore likely to bo the method &apos;of asoeprtainin^; African opAuiPJl0nr*- Smith said that, even so, he hoped that tne United KingdomGovernment would not allow themselves to bo trapped into indicatingpublicly, before they had received proposals from the Government of SouthernRhodesia, whether they would, or v/ould not, regard any particular procedure as on adequate means of ascertaining African opinion.Tlie^ Commonwealth Secretary agreed.     It should be part of the under-standing between the two Governments that neither of thorn would publiclycommit themselves, until tho time came, to any particular method of consultation.    &apos;v?&apos;e assumed, of course, that the Government of SouthernRhodesia v/ould consult us privately on their proposals before they putthum to us formally.The Prinie^ Hinistor said that, in addition to specifying sufficientlyreprosontativo institutions as a condition of tho grant of independence, v/ehad also publicly indicated that independence could only be conceded onthe basis of majority rule.     Here was another point on which we might beasked whether the communique was consistent with our previous declarationsof policy.Hrv; Smith said that, if he did succeed in convincing tho BritishGovernment that African opinion v/ould accept independence on tho basis ofthe present constitution, they would not in effect bo able to adhere totheir earlier stipulations that majority rule and sufficiently representa-tive institutions must be a pre-condition of the grant of independence.The^ Prime jJinisjter replied that he must, nevertheless, remain whollyfree to say that we did adhere to our previous statements that sufficientlyrepresentative institutions would be a pre-condition,He. Smith replied that he would accept this.     &quot;What he would not accept was a pre-condition requiring greater African representation in thoLegislature, if the Africans themselves indicated that thoy did not want it,

The Prime Minister said that greater African representation in theLegislature was precisely what sufficiently representative institutionsmeant - unless the people of Southern Rhodesia made it wholly clear thatthey did not want this change.    le continued to regard an increase inAfrican representation as a pre-condition of the grant of independence,although we would, of course, he ready to consider any clear depression of african opinion on this subject.     In short, we believed - and we must continue to say publicly that we believed - that the Africans themselveswanted greater representation;   but we could add that we were ready to be convinced to the contrary, if Mr. Smith could convince us0Ijra- Sni. th replied that the choice -which he intended to offer -was the simple option to accept or to reject independence on the basis of thepresent constitution - not on the basis of the present constitution withthe prospect of this, that or some other amendment.     He would give thissimple choice;   he would make it clear to the Africans that the alternative was an African nationaliet government;   -and he believed that tho greatmajority of them would be so appalled by this prospect that they wouldvote in favour of his own proposal,The^Prine^ Minister repeated that it was essential that Hr. Smithshould be under no illusions,       Sufficiently representative institutionshad always meant greater African representation.     It must continue in ourmouths, to mean this.HEETIKS; AT ?.3Q p*a. ON THURSDAY. 10th SEPQEMBIiR, 1964The; Prime Idnistor said that he wished to propose a revised form ofcommunique.The United kingdom s position must be reserved and must be seen to be reserved.     We must therefore insist on the inclusion in tho communique&apos; ofa sentence or sentences indicating that we had made it plain to Mr. Smiththat we reserved our position;   and we must also insist .fea.t this, should form. its., final paragraph in jyder that our reservation might be seen to applyovarv the whole field of the discussion.........The meeting then formally approved tho draft communique in its finalversion, as at Annex.-iii-
