33DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C,(65) 145 COPY NO.   g g5th November, 1965CABINETEARNINGS-RELATED SHORT-TERM benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance in July I was invited by the Cabinet (C. 0.(65) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 4) tc open discussions with the Trades Union Congress (T. U. C. ),the Confederation of British Industries (C. B.I. ) and other interested bodies on my proposals for a scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits, as set out in memorandum C.(65) 112.    These discussions have now been taken as far as possible within the limits of confidentialityand time available.    They were conducted either directly with the organisations concerned or through the machinery of the official committee on Occupational Pensions (O. G. O. X-7. ) which was used to consult a wide range of employers in the public sector, including the nationalised industries and local authority associations, with a particular interest in the proposed modification of the arrangements for contracting out of part of the State pension scheme.    I now report the outcome ofthese consultations.2.       Appendix I to this memorandum summarises the observationsmade on the proposed scheme.     Vhile some features of it have been criticised, the general tenor of my discussions and of the commentsreceived has confirmed me in the belief that the proposed scheme represents a realistic assessment of what we can reasonably hope to achieve by theautumn of next year as an interim measure in advance of the result of thegeneral review of social security benefits.    In the light of experience ofthe operation of the scheme refinements will no doubt be possible whenclaimants, employers and the staff of the Departments concerned have become used to the new techniques required and our resources are increased by the availability of automatic data processing equipment.3.       As regards the proposed change in the contracting-out arrangements the reaction of those consulted has, of course, varied.    Some of the bodies concerned welcome it, a few dislike it;  but the attitude of themajority can be summed up as one of reluctant acquiescence.    in practically all quarters there is a recognition of the inevitability of sucha change v/ithin the next few years and an acceptance of the reasoningwhich has led me to conclude that it should be made now.    There isunderstandable concern particularly in the public sector with the implications of the new ^arrangements for some pension schemes and related conditions of service.   The effect of any change in the national insurance scheme on conditions of employment is, however, a matter for normal employer/employee negotiations.    In this connection it has been strongly urged upon me that concurrently with the proposed changes in-1-

national insurance arrangements the Government,as employer, oughtto initiate negotiations v/ith public sector employees on the long-termrelationship between their occupational provision and the State scheme.It is clear that such negotiations will be necessary and they are boundto be both legthy and controversial.    The flat-rate abatement planitself if generally accepted not only as a sensible way of bringingcontracted-out employees into the scope of the graduated system ofcontributions which will finance the new earnings-related benefits butalso as a means of removing an obstacle to the development of longer-term plans in the pension field.4.       While I must emphasise that flat-rate abatement is the only practicable method I have found both for dealing with our immediatebenefit proposals and for making room for future developments, I donot put it forward as just a technical device.    I see it as an essentialfirst step tov/ards our long-term plans for a dynamic earnings-relatedpension scheme and it also has immediate merits of its own.    It wouldprovide every worker with the cover of the graduated scheme forwidowhood;   it would relieve the lower-paid contracted-out worker of a quite unjust contribution burden;  and it would secure a fairercontribution from the higher-paid contracted-out worker who is atpresent paying less than he ought.    The proposed change is explained in more detail in Appendix II.5. With the inclusion of earnings-related widow&apos;s allowance whichwas recently agreed by Cabinet (C, C. (65) 55th Conclusions, Minute 3),the cost of my proposals would be about  59 million a year.6.       If we are to bring earnings-related short-term benefits intopayment in the autumn of 1966 the Bill to give effect to these proposals must be presented immediately after the Christmas Recess and passedby the end of March.    This is a very tight timetable and it is now urgentthat we finalise our views.    I therefore invite the Cabinet&apos;s approval ofan interim scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits, accompaniedby changes in contributions and contracting-out arrangements, on thebasis of the proposals set out in C.(65) 112.M.H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.G.2.4th November, 1965-2-

They objoctedin particular to the proposal (paragraph 20 of 0.(65) 112) that, in injury-3-

A &quot;\ 1*1.S C ebenefit cases, the existing 55/- differential between the rates of injury-benefit and sickness benefit should be paid on top of the benefit ceiling.I impressed upon the T.U.C. the importance in an earnings-related schemeof keeping the maximum rate of benefit below the level of take-home pay(subject to zKJtaining the normal preference for those who are injured atwork).   The proposed benefit ceiling seems a reasonable compromise betweenthe conflicting views of the two sides of industry.Reference period for reckonable earnings5,     The proposal to use gross earnings in the previous tax year was strongly supported by the C.B.I, who assured me that employers would bevery ready to co-operate in making the scheme work on this basis,   (Suchco-operation will be vital to the success of the scheme.)   The T.U.C. accept that there Is no better practical alternative for a scheme to start nextyear but they hope it will be possible eventually to adopt a more flexiblereference period.No allowance for interruption of earnings in tho reference period6.     The T,U,C. were disappointed hy this feature of the proposed schemeand argued that benefit should be based on earnings during actual weeks ofwork, i.e4, by dividing the tax-year earnings not by fifty but by the numberof weeks of work,   I explained that this would impose a greatly increasedadministrative burden which I could not undertake at the start of the new-scheme, and that there were in any case objections of,principle to what theT.U.C. had in mind.   The additional cost of paying benefit in respect ofnotional earnings on which no contributions had been paid would have to bemet by a general increase in contribution rates and this would mean thatlower-paid workers in steady employment would be subsidising higher benefits for higher-paid workers.   I pointed out, however, that automatic data processing might eventually enable us to moke some allowance for periods ofinterruption of employment during, the reference period and the T.U.C. seemedpartly satisfied by my assurance that this would be carefully consideredonce the new scheme was established.Duration of earnings-related supplement7,     The C.B.I. would prefer three months&apos; earnings-related supplement, butare prepared to accept six months as the absolute maximum.   The T.U.C. stillfeel that the supplement should be payable for a year (as proposed in new Frontiers) but did not press their view at all strongly.   In the context of the proposal (paragraph 15 of C,(65) 112) to rationalise the duration offlat-rate unemployment benefit by providing a standard maximum duration of twelve months for every Claimant (instead of the present system of fromseven to nineteen months depending on a claimant&apos;s previous insurance record)

the T.U.C. asked about the position of the long-tern unemployed and putforward their view that unemployment benefit, like sickness benefit, shouldbe of unlimited duration.   I explained that the question of provision forthe long-term sick and unemployed was being looked at as part of thegeneral, national insurance review, and that the present interim scheme would not prejudice the ultimate decision on the structure of benefit forlong-term interruption of employment.Waiting days8.     The T.U.C. thought that the proposed twelve-day waiting-day period forearnings-related supplements was too long and argued that, if it wasnecessary for administrative reasons, the supplement should be paidretrospectively once the spell of sickness or unemployment had lasted fortwelve days.   I explained the reasons for the twelve-day waiting period(which were set out in paragraphs 16 to 17 of C.(65) 112) and pointed outthat to make retrospective payments whore interruption of employment hadlasted for twelve days would provide a substantial and highly undesirablefinancial incentive for many claimants to delay their return to work.This would not only place an intolerable strain on the scheme but would greatly inorease its cost.B - Changes in contracting-out and the flat-rate abatement plan9.     Consultations on the proposals for changes in contracting-out and the flat-rate abatement plan have taken place with the four following interests:the actuarial profession and the Life Offices and other representatives ofPensions Funds and of private insurance interests;   employers asrepresented by the C.B.I; employed persons through the medium of theT.U.C.;   and Government Departments and other public bodies in their capacity as employers.Actuaries10.   The Institute of Actuaries and their Scottish colleagues, the Facultyof Actuaries, sent me a detailed memorandum.   They referred to previousdocuments which they issued when the present graduated pension scheme wasbeing prepared, in whioh they argued that the present form of contracting-out would work satisfactorily only for so long&apos; as the scope of the schemewas limited.   They say that the new proposals go a long way to meet this objection to the present arrangements.   Their memorandum is distinctlyfavourable to my proposals.-5-

Representatives of insured and other pension schemes11.   Representatives of the Life Offices and, generally speaking, of other organisations interested, in occupational pensions in the private sectorregard my proposals with favour, as they have practical experience of thedrawbacks of the present system of contracting-out and recognise that itcannot be adapted even to relatively minor future changes in the state scheme.   They see the proposals as a firm and lasting basis on which Stateand occupational pensions can operate side by side.   Their main concern about flat-rate abatement is that the contribution reduction offered tocontraotod-out employers should not be so small that they may be tempted to wind up, or cut back, their occupational schemes rather than continueto contract out.   Tho figures on which I have been working (seeAppendix II, paragraph 6) would, I think, be accepted by responsibleopinion in the pension world as a reasonable settlement.C.B.I.12.   The C.B.I. accept the need for change and have told mo that they do not wish to oppose my proposals.T.U.C.13.   The T.U.C. were concerned that tho time available for consultation didnot allow then adequately to test the fooling of their affiliated bodies,and consequently consider that they must reserve their position on theGovernmentfs proposals.   In general, however, they accept the arguments whichhave led us to propose flat-rate abatement, although they are concerned that this should not load to the establishment of many different categories of pensioner with entitlement calculated in separate ways.   It was clearly not possible for me to assure them that the level of abatement proposed to operate from next year would never be varied, but the T.U.C. regard it as apoint in the scheme&apos;s favour that I was able to toll them that we did not intend that the abatement would bo adjusted automatic ally when changes weremade in other features of national insurance, and that indeed this was oneof the objectives of the scheme.14.   The T^CVs principal reservation is that flat-rate abatement, while areasonable provision for employees in private occupational schemes, cannotbe applied in the public sector without considerable disadvantage to the employees concerned.   The problem here is that, whereas the terms ofemployment alloy/ an occupational pension and a flat-irate national insurance pension to be drawn together (in some cases with a modification of the occupational pension of up to 26/- a week), occupational pensions havenormally been adjusted to take account of the whole of any graduated national insurance benefit earned.   Thus a change in national insurance which meant-6-

that contracted-out employees began to contribute towards graduated benefit,while losing a part of their flat-rate entitlement, would be doublydisadvantageous to civil servants and others in similar employments.   TheT.U.C, agree that a long-term solution must be found in re-negotiating thetailoring national insurance to the special circumstances of public sectoremployees, but in the meantime they are prepared to give their full support to representations by the unions whicl for public service employees and similar bodies against a worsening of their terms of service.Local Authorities15.   The reactions of local authority associations are a little mixed.   Ingeneral, they have concentrated attention not so much on my proposals,which they do not oppose, as on the methods by which they might adapt theirown arrangements to then.   No doubt they have in nind that, as at presentless than half of their employees are contracted-out, they have room for manoeuvre in extending contracting-out and the net financial effect, for employers and the majority of employees, could well bo advantageous.Pjthgr public sector employers 16.   The replies received from Government departments and public bodiesthrough the consultation machinery of the O.C.O.P. have similarly confcentrated on the anomalous results of applying flat-rate abatement to the type of occupational pension provision which at present exists for their employees.   Some employing departments make the point that their staff -whose total present contribution liability of l6/l a week will in manycases increase (and in those cases the amount of the increase will be any-thing up to a further A/ll a week) - will not stand to gain anything fromthe proposals, because they will not be able to qualify for the new earnings-related benefits, since they already receive full pay during six months&apos;sickness, and unemployment is not a likely contingency for then.   Hence they say that, fron their point of view, it would be desirable for the present scheme to continue with as few changes as possible until the Government&apos;slong-term review is conplete.   But most of the replies accept thatgraduated national insurance liability has to be extended to the contracted-out, and that the flat-rate abatenent scheme seems a sensible way of doing this;   their concern is at the effect which, under present arrangements,the Government&apos;s proposals would have on their own employees&apos; presentconditions of service.   But, of course, these are matters which can only besettled by employer-employee negotiations in the light of firm government decisions on the national arrangenents.provisions for the adjustment of occupational pension, rather than in-7-

17.   At the meeting at which the proposals were discussed the O.C.O.P.recommended that consideration should be given as a matter of urgency to establishing a type of pension provision in the public sector which wascompatible with the extension of the earnings-related State pension scheme.One solution envisaged was &quot;integration&quot;, whereby the Civil Service andother public bodies would contract in to the national scheme, and the occupational pension would serve to &quot;top-up&quot; the eraployeeb eventual fullState benefit to a pre-arranged level.   It seems clear that working out and agreeing the details of any new arrangements (which would not of course be a matter for me, but for the Government as employer) will be a lengthyand controversial business, particularly perhaps for the Civil Service andthe police;   and I have been warned that resentment may well arise fromthe fact that the need for new arrangements will spring from the establish-ment of a scheme of sickness and unemployment benefit which is itselfunlikely to benefit public sector employees.   Prom the point of view of timing, however, the flat-rate abatement scheme will also take some while to have any appreciable effect:   the graduated benefit earned and the flat-rate pension foregone under the scheme by a contracted-out employee willeach amount to only two or three shillings a week by the end of 1968.   Thismeans that time will be available for occupational provision in the public sector to be put on to a revised basis before the anomalies caused, by the flat-rate abatement scheme become too glaring or too burdensome in thatsector.Cost18,   It is the intension that the change to flat-rate abatement should beself-balancing - that is, that the extra contribution income which will arise from extending graduated contribution liability to the contracted-out should be used to finance a general reduction in flat-rate contributions inso far as the finances of the National Insurance Fund permit.-8-f ft AD-:Ul

F ft 9tj &quot;jr h)APPEj^IX IITHE PRESEIFJ COFi?MCTPT&amp;-OUT..SYSgICIl AHD EE PROPOSED SYSTEMOF FLAT-RATE j ABATEMENTThe present system *     Under existing arrangements an employer with an adequate occupational pension scheme can contract his employees out of the graduated part of thenational insurance scheme.     Employer and employee do not pay graduated contributions and the employee does not earn graduated pension.     but because the graduated contribution includes an element to support flat-ratebenefits, they pay in place of this element a larger flat-rate contributionthan others.The need for change2,     There are two separate reasons for wishing to change the existing arrangements.     First the new earnings-related short-term benefits must be matched by a contribution similarly related to earnings.     (Otherwise thelower paid would be subsidising the benefits of the higher paid).     Workerscontracted out for pension cannot be excluded from the new short-term benefits and must therefore start to pa;/ graduated contributions.     It isadministratively scarcely practicable to collect two different graduated contributions for different categories of worker counting differently forbenefits.3.     Secondly, quite apart from the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefits, there are strong arguments for changing the present contracting-out arrangements which involve the following inequities:-(a) Most occupational schemes do not make provision for an employee&apos;swidow.     Thus when an employee is contracted out he loses the cover for his widow provided under the gra.dua.ted pension scheme (whenherself retired, she receives half the graduated pension her husband had earned) without any guarantee and usually with no prospect of alternative provision for her.(b) The graduated pension now being earned is fixed in the legislation in money terms.     It will not be possible to up-rate the graduated pension already earned without doing an injustice to those whohave been contracted out.     The guaranteed occupational pension on the strength of which their employers were able to take them out of the graduated scheme cannot be increased by government action.

(c) The higher flat-rate contribution paid by those contracted out bearsharshly on the lower-paid employee and is over-generous to thehigher-paid.     In the extreme case the contracted-out man earning 9 a week is paying 2s. 5&amp;. more by way of national insurance contribution than if he were not contracted out but gets no morenational insurance pension in return.     If his occupational schemeis contributory, as it usually Is, the total contribution burdenfor him is excessive.(d) The present requirement that even those with low earnings should if contracted out be assured an occupational pension at the rateappropriate to earnings of  18, can distort an occupational schemeand impose on it an excessive charge when young workers leave the employer and are brought back into the graduated scheme as if theyhad been earning  18 a week.4. These flaws in the present arrangements all flow from the attempt to match unlike provisions for those contracted in and those contracted out.For the former the law provides a pension and a contribution varying with earnings, pension rights capable of adjustment by Parliament in line withchanged nonej values and provision for widows; for the latter none of these provisions apply.j5.     If we were prepared to support these inequities it v/ould no doubt bepossible for the present arrangements, unsatisfactory as they are, to continue as long as no other changes are made in the national insurance scheme.     Butthey could scarcely remain tolerable if on the occasion of a future general increase of benefit rates it were desired to expand the span of earningsattracting graduated contributions.     If for instance graduated contributions were collected on earnings from  ? up to  24 the amount payable by the contracted-in employee would vary (according to earnings) from nothing upto 12s. 9d. (in 1 961 it went only as far as 5s. 1d.) and this wide range of contribution v/ould still have to bo matched by a. flat-rate contribution forthe contracted-out.     The maximum amount of graduated retirement pension for widows (originally 21s.) would become 52s. 6d. but v/ould still illogically be denied to the widows of men contracted out.     The occupational pension to be guaranteed for those contracted out v/ould be at the rate of  5 5s. for a working life (originally  2 2s.) and the lower-paid worker would have to pay contributions at a level geared to providing for him and his wife pension(State plus occupational) of  11 15s. - in some cases above his currentearnings. ;-10-

CONFIDENTIAL *        503(c) The higher flat-rate contribution paid by those contracted out bearsharshly on the lower-paid employee and is over-generous to thehigher-paid.

If we were prepared to support these inequities it would no doubt bepossible for the present arrangements, unsatisfactory as they are, to continue as long as no other changes are made in the national insurance scheme.     Butthey could scarcely remain tolerable if on the occasion of a future general increase of benefit rates it were desired to expand the span of earningsattracting graduated contributions.

0 ;j d6.     The proposed scheme of flat-rate abatement is designed to fulfil the primary purpose of contracting out, that is to avoid undesirable overlapbetween national insurance and occupational provision, while getting rid ofthe objectional elements of the present arrangements.     Its main featureswould be:-(a) The contracted-out would pay the same graduated contributions andqualify for the same earnings-related short-term benefits and thesame graduated pensions, including graduated retirement pension for widows, as the contracted-in.(b) The employer would be able to contract out his employees on thesame conditions as at present.     The level of pension to be guaranteed under the occupational scheme would also be the sameas it is now.     For a. man this is about 1s. hd. a week for eachyear of contracted-out employment,(c) The contracted-out employee would have his national insurance pension abated b;* a fixed amount in respect of each year duringwhich he was contracted out.     (This amount would, I propose, be is. a week for a man - rather less than the amount guaranteedunder the occupational scheme).(d) In recognition of the reduced commitment of the National insurance fund and the commitment assumed by the employer, the contracted-out man and his employer would each pay a flat-rate contributionlower (l am proposing by 2s. 3d. a week) than those for contracted-in employees.The figures in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) above have not yob been approvedby the Treasury.Advantages of the change7.     The basic advantage of my proposal is that instead of trying to equate,as does the scheme we inherited, a fixed amount of pension which the employer is required, to provide with a variable amount of State pension which the worker forgoes, we should be balancing like with like;   the employer would still be required to provide a fixed amount of pension for each year ofcontracted-out employment, but this would be in substitution for a fixedamount of State pension forgone.     The immediate consequence would be toremove for the future the inequities listed in paragraph 3 above.Additionally the small but necessarily universal graduated contribution forthe new short-term benefits would be easily collected along with the biggergraduated pension contribution now also universal in its application.-11-

CONFIDENTIAL -       gggReasons for making the change now3.     As we are anxious to introduce the new short-term &quot;benefits in the shortest possible time it is tempting to concentrate on that task and to postpone changes in the contracting-out provisions.     The objections to this are over-riding.     First, to collect for the contracted-out only the smallgraduated contribution for the new benefits but for others the combinedpension and short-term benefit contribution would introduce very formidabledifficulties both for my Department and for employers.     Secondly, once the machinery existed for collecting graduated contributions for the contracted out it would be wrong not to use it to get rid of existing inequities, listed in paragraph 3 above.     Lastly, if a change became inevitable, as sooner or later it must, a benefit increase.se Bill, necessarily rushed through againsttime, is not a suitable vehicle for structural changes which Parliamentmust be allowed adequate time to discuss and employers to operate.-1 ?.-
