THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1965C. (65) 119 Copy No.     5 95th August, 1965CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsOur relations with the Germans have taken a turn for the betterlately. The State Visit evoked a very warm response in Germanywhere it was rightly seen as a friendly gesture made as a matter ofBritish policy; and the new Offset Agreement should substantiallyreduce the foreign exchange burden of stationing our forces inGermany. But two world wars and the horrors of Nazism have leftsuch a legacy of bitterness that we cannot be sure that Anglo-Germanreconciliation will last unless we for our part work to make it do so.2. If Germany&apos;s future attitudes were unimportant to us, weshould not need to worry too much about Anglo-German relationspossibly going sour once more. But in fact, because of the way inwhich things have developed over the years, Germany&apos;s attitude(given in particular her relationship with the United States) is goingto be of the first importance to us. We have compelling reasons ofnational interest for persevering in the policy expressed in the StateVisit and trying to work constructively with the Germans. I am circulating this paper to my Cabinet colleagues in order to give my views of what this fact implies for our policy towards Germany.3. German attitudes are important because the federal german Government are bound to play a key role in developments in many spheres of vital interest to us:(i) United States foreign policy the United States Government are looking around with a newurgency for Allies who have something solid to contribute to theiralliances. Inevitably the Germans catch their eye, both because theyare already contributing a good deal and because they are prosperousenough to contribute still more. The Germans already provide thelargest national contingent in the conventional forces of NATO inEurope. They also offset a large part of the American and british foreign exchange expenditure on maintaining forces in Germany.Nevertheless, their balance of payments remains strong and their defence budget is only 5-1 per cent of their G.N.P. The americans are hoping, as Mr. Rusk has recently confirmed to us, to persuade5973A
the Germans to increase their supporting efforts both in and outside europe. No doubt that is why President Johnson agreed at the endof his talks with Chancellor Erhard in June to meet him regularlyin future. German views on foreign policy are worth the Presidentsattention.This situation is likely to continue, whatever the politicalcomplexion of the next German Government. It means that the americans will have a strong interest in preserving a goodunderstanding with the Germans. Naturally, the Americans will want to work closely with us; but they will find it much easier to respond to British initiatives and ideas about problems in which Bonn hasa vital interest if they do not have the feeling, for which there hassometimes been reason in the past, that they are likely in thatcontext to find themselves at loggerheads with the Germans. this consideration is particularly relevant where proposals for reducingEast/West tension and for organising the defence of the free world(which we said in the Speech from the Throne last November werethe main aims of our foreign policy) are concerned. Almost all such proposals are bound to impinge on the German problem in some way and the Germans are bound to have strong views about them whichcannot be ignored. As far as problems East of Suez are concerned,the German attitude is at present of relatively little importance, butthis situation may change if American efforts to widen the area ofGerman interest are successful. It follows from all this that our influence in Washington is bound to be affected to an importantdegree by our standing in Bonn.(ii) Future of NATO and- nuclear sharingFrance is threatening to break away from the present integratedstructure of NATO which the rest of the Allies intend to preserveand if possible to strengthen. In this situation, Germany&apos;s attitude is vital. In the last resort, NATO can and if necessary will exist withoutFrance; without Germany it could not. The key to NATO&apos;s futuretherefore, is Anglo-American-German co-operation. If Francedecides to weaken her NATO links, we shall want to play for timeand prevent a break for as long as possible. This must also be in theinterests of the Germans who have stoutly resisted General de gaulle&apos;s efforts to win them over to his ideas about european defence, and we should be able to count on their co-operation.But we do not want loyalty to Washington to tempt the germans to seek a special American-German relationship within NATO, fromwhich Britain would be excluded. There would be a risk of german policy developing along these lines if the Germans gained theimpression that the main objective of our proposals for nuclearsharing was not only to contain their ambitions but also to keep them in what they considered a position of inferiority within NATO.If matters went this way, there would also be some risk that theAmerican response to Germany would not be entirely negative.There are already influential American voices raised in favour ofthe argument that Germany is America&apos;s best ally. This is why in
SECRET3our ANF plan we are committed to a scheme which gives the UnitedStates, Germany and Britain equality on the control authority of theForce. Convincing the Germans of our good intentions will help toput over our own ideas on nuclear sharing within the Alliance and to block proposals we do not want.(iii) British relations with the E.E.C.The Federal Republic is more interested in access to EFTAmarkets than is any other E.E.C. country. Germans therefore have more reason than the others to sympathise with the Vienna initiative and Dr. Schroeders attitude at the recent W.E.U. Meeting in luxembourg confirmed this. More generally, too, the federal republic has always wanted Britain to be a part of political andeconomic Europe. She is, therefore, qualified to be our most effectivefriend in the E.E.C. camp in our campaign to prevent Europehardening into rival trade blocs. Hitherto, the fear of offendingde Gaulle has limited the extent to which the Germans have been willing to side with us in practice. But they are now showing signsof being readier to stand up to the French. If we can secure Germanco-operation, our prospects of shaping Western Europe&apos;s economicand political future to the designs which suit us best will be greatly improved.(iv) East I West relations and arms control the position of the German Government is crucial in any move towards an East/West detente in Europe because German territoryis bound to be involved. No one, not even the United States, cannow coerce the Germans into accepting arrangements that they donot want; and they do not want any arrangements that deepen the division of Germany. Given German influence in Washington andNATO, any British initiative in the realm of European security is unlikely to prosper unless it has the support of the Government inBonn. There is a clear case therefore for taking the Germans more into our confidence on arms control and disarmament matters, andthey have indicated that they would welcome bilateral talks. we need to dispel the long-standing German fears that we are trying to make a settlement with the Russians at the expense of theGerman claim to national unity. We must try to persuade themthat progress towards reunification can only be made in an atmosphere of East/West detente, and that the right arms controlmeasures can contribute towards the creation of such an atmosphere,even if they are not linked with provisions for immediate progress towards German reunification. There are signs of increasing interestin Germany in this line of approach, although the political parties are bound to be cautious in the pre-election period.(v) International economic questions the British economy needs time and help to regain strength.The German economy is so strong that the Federal Government hasa part to play second only to the United States in deciding whether we obtain what we need from the international community. So far,5973
4SECRETthe Federal Government have given full support to our approaches to central banks, the I.M.F. and the Group of Ten. We cannot besure of French support and the American capacity to help, thoughgreat, may be insufficient by itself. The Germans will continue to bein a key position in deciding international policies on support forsterling, liquidity questions, and aid to developing countries. we need their support for our aims and we are most likely to obtain it if the general atmosphere of Anglo-German relations remains asgood as it has recently been.4. Clearly we need good relations with Bonn. If we are to havethese we must, of course, in accordance with our repeated pledges,continue to support the German claim to peaceful reunification;maintain strong forces in Germany; defend the Allied position inBerlin; and refuse to recognise East Germany in any way. It isparticularly important that we should back up Bonn&apos;s efforts toprevent any growth in the international standing of the East Germanregime. By using our influence in the Commonwealth to this endwe can earn much German gratitude.5. But our pursuit of these policies will not pay its full dividendin terms of German confidence and goodwill towards Britain if atthe same time we give the impression that we dislike and distrustthe Germans and regard the Federal Republic as a potential menace to peace. If we are to inject warmth into Anglo-German relations,we must now show that we accept the Federal Republic as a leadingmember of NATO and a friendly partner in the Western community of nations. One way of doing this would be to develop the habit of discussing our policies with the Germans while they are still in aformative stage. We ought also to develop Ministerial contacts,technological collaboration and cultural and youth exchanges. I thinkthat youth exchanges have a special importance because they will help towards reconciliation with the post-war generation in Germany whobear none of the guilt of the Nazi past. This line of policy would,of course, require Ministers to give an appropriate lead to Britishopinion. If we try to encourage the British people to think ofcontemporary Germany in a more friendly way, all the indications are that the Germans will be happy to come more than half way tomeet us and that this, in its turn, will be the best possible insurance against a return to atavism. They feel a particular need forreconciliation with the British people and this is an asset which wecan turn to good account.6. Anglo-German friendship is all the more desirable becausepolitical stability in Germany is still a tender growth. general de Gaulle&apos;s nationalistic policies are striking an echo throughout europe with inevitable consequences in Germany. British friendshipcan help to strengthen the healthy trends in German society whichare now dominant. If we rebuff the Germans they are that much the more likely to conclude that striking independent nationalisticattitudes may be the best way of seeking their objectives, including that of reunification, and that British strength and stability do not much matter to them.
7. To sum up, there is too much at stake for our own future to allow feelings about the past to govern our approach to Anglo-German relations. Given the equivocal attitude of the French, it ismore and more through a close relationship of real confidence withBonn as well as with Washington that we can work effectively towards our vital aims in foreign and even in domestic affairs. It is within our power to achieve such a relationship with Bonn and I hope that Ishall have the full support of my colleagues in making the necessaryeffort to do so.M.
