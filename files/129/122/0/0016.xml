THE PLAN IN OUTLINE1.     This is a Plan to provide the basis for faster economic growth.    An essential part of the Plan is a solution to Britain&apos;balance of payments problem;    for growth, cannot be maintainedunless we pay our way in the world.2.     Por too long the United Kingdom has suffered from a weakbalance of payments.    Periodic crises have led to sharp checksto economic expansion and productive investment;    these in turnhave left us vulnerable to fui^ther balance of payments difficulties when expansion was resumed.    It is the Government&apos;saim to break out of this vicious circle and to introduce and maintain policies which will enable us to enjoy more rapid andmore sustained economic growth.3,     In 1964 the overall balance of payments deficit rose to an exceptionally high level.    The Government has taken a series of measures to redress the position, and it is hoped that at leasthalf the deficit will have been removed this year.    But thereis still a substantial imbalance to be removed, and the debtincurred in 1964 and 1965 will have to be repaid by the end ofthe decade.4-.     The task of correcting the balance of payments and achieving the surplus necessary to repay our debts, while at the same timefostering the rapid growth of the economy, is the centralchallenge we face in economic planning.THE GROWTH TARGET5.     The Plan is designed to achieve a 25 per cent increase in national output between 1964 and 1970.    This objective has beenchosen in the light of past trends in national output and output per head and a realistic view of the scope for improving upon them.    It involves achieving a 4 per cent annual growth rate of output well before 1970 and an annual average of 3.8 per cent between 1964 and 1970.-L o 1CHAPTER 1

6.     The rate of increase in total output depends on two factors;the rate of growth of output per head (in other wordsproductivity);    and the rate of growth of the labour force.&apos;       2t? (Over the last decade the labour force has been increasing byabout 0.7 per cent a year.    But from now on this growth islikely to be much less.    On present trends it would average0.25 per cent per annum.    Successful regional policies to bringmore people into employment in areas where there are now not enough jobs might bring the rate of increase up to nearly 0. per cent a year.    Even then by far the greater part of theincrease in output will have to come from an increase in output per head, which will have to rise on average by about 3-4 percent a year to achieve the national growth target.7.     In the past the rate of increase of productivity hasfluctuated sharply from year to year, largely reflecting short-term changes in demand.    After allowing for these fluctuationsthe underlying growth of output per head seems to have averagedabout 2 per cent in the early 1950s, 2-f per cent over the period from I960 to 1964, and may now have reached a rate of about 3 per cent per annum.    The required acceleration to 3.4 per centthus seems feasible in the light of past trends;    but it willnot come about without a great effort on the part of management and workers to improve efficiency, as well as a Governmenteconomic policy which gives priority to this objective.THE NATURE AND!PURPOSE OF PLANNING8.     Our economy, like most others in the modern world, is a mixed one.    The Government element is important.    public spendingis a large part of total expenditure;    for this reason theGovernment must raise large stuns in taxation;    a large part ofthe basic industry of the country is carried on by public corporations;    the Government is able to exercise authority inmany other fields.    All this gives the Government great economicpower and influence.    It intends to use this to secure faster growth and national solvency.9.     Most manufacturing industry and commerce is, and willcontinue to be, largely governed by the market economy.    Butthis does not necessarily and without active Government influencebring about the results which the nation needs - for example,

sufficient exports to pay for our imports and other overseas expenditure.    Also, the forces of competition often operate tooslowly.    Then again, where productive units are large and investment decisions have to be taken two to five years ahead,competing companies tend to bunch their investment, holdingback and moving forward together, producing surplus or over-stretched resources.    There is, too, little doubt that inadequacy of investment in British industry has resulted in increasinghome demand being met by a greater flow of imports than the economy could afford.10.    Sometimes government action may be required to strengthen the forces of competition, for example by reinforcing thelegislation against restrictive practices or providing for more disclosure in company accounts.    In other cases, such asthe regional distribution of industry, and transport, importantsocial costs arise which are not expressed in market prices;and positive Government action is required to supplement marketforces.    Each case must be judged on its merits.    The marketeconomy will continue as a general background to all otherpolicies and care will be taken not to destroy the complexmechanisms on which it is based.    The end product of bothco-operative planning and the market economy is an internationallycompetitive industry;    and in securing this aim they complementeach other.11.    Both government and industry have to plan several years ahead and it is desirable to co-ordinate the forward estimates of both.    Public expenditure cannot be planned realisticallywithout some idea of the rate at which the economy can beexpected to grow and of the size of other claims on resources,for example for industrial investment.    For this reason theassembly of the forecasts and plans of private industry is agreat help in planning the public sector..    Similarly, indus-industrialists should benefit, both from the collection of the plans of other industries which are their customers, and from aknowledge of the intentions of Government, which is by far thelargest buyer in the country.12.    Some of the forecasts or projections for particular industries will inevitably turn out to be wrong.    But this doesnot mean that it is useless to make them.    Many progressive

1.4firms already look ahead in quantitative terms for up to fiveyears and sometimes more.    The projections in the Plan are essentially attempts by government and industry, working inco-operation, to break down the global objective of a 25 percent growth rate into the implications for particular industries.These projections should help firms and industries to take moreinformed decisions than if they were left in the dark aboutother people&apos;s intentions and beliefs.13&quot;    Forecasts are also a useful control device.    If an industryfalls below projection it will be valuable to discover why.    Insome cases (e.g. if consumers&apos; preferences have been wronglyforecast) no action by government may be indicated.    But inother cases (e.g. if it is due to the failure of productivityto rise) it will serve as a useful warning signal for action by industry, by government,  or by both In co-operation.THE INDUSTRIAL INQUIRY14.    The first stage in making a plan is to find out the facts,not simply about the past but about future intentions, potentialities-tialities and problems.    This is the main purpose of theindustrial inquiry which has been carried out this year.Building on the pioneering work of the National economic development Council the inquiry has been extended to cover mostof the economy, both the public and the private sectors and theproduction of both goods and services.    Industries were asked what 25 per cent national growth from 1964 to 1970 would meanfor them.    The co-operation received has been excellent.15.    Perhaps the most encouraging result of the inquiry was inthe field of exports.    The replies from industry suggested thatthese could grow by about 5ir per cent a year in volume.    Thisis broadly the rate required to achieve our balance of paymentsobjectives (see Chapter 7).    It is substantially faster thanthe average of about 3 per cent a year over the past decade.It is also substantially faster than the forecasts given to theNational Economic Development Council in its 1962 inquiry.    the replies from industry must be treated with caution, asprojections are particularly difficult in this field.    However,the changing geographical and commodity composition of our exports makes it reasonable to expect a faster expansion in

future, as a growing proportion of our exports is now going tothe more rapidly expanding markets and is in the more rapidly expanding lines;    there has already been some acceleration inthe growth of exports in recent years.    Some of the reasons give by industries for expecting a further acceleration areoutlined in Chapter 7 (paragraphs ).    The forecastexpansion of 5tf per cent a year should be attainable;   world trade in manufactures is expected to grow at a faster rate than this over the Plan period.    But the rate forecast will not come about automatically.    To obtain it important changes inattitudes and policies are required, a point which was made clear by the industries concerned.16.    The inquiry suggested that national productivity (output per head) could grow by 3.1 per cent a yearbetween 1964 and 1970 (see Chapter 2).    This is substantiallyfaster than the average growth over the past 10-15 years, but less than the rate of 3.4 per cent required to achieve thegrowth programme.    In the light of past trends (see paragraph above), it should be possible to improve on industry&apos;s forecast,and to do substantially better given new policies to raiseindustrial efficiency and economise manpower.17.    Since the productivity increo.se forecast by the IndustrialInquiry is not yet quite enough to achieve 25 per cent nationalgrowth, there is an apparent &quot;manpower gap&quot;, with the demand for extra labour exceeding the additional labour likely to become available, without changes in policies, by about 400,000.    Thisgap could be reduced to about 200,000 by successful regional policies.    No great significance can be attached to this precisefigure, given the difficulties of forecasting supply and demandfor labour five years ahead;    and it is not large in relationto a total labour force of over 25 million.    But it is substantialin relation to the growth of the labour force.18.    The inquiry revealed the need for large movements of labour,with three major sectors - agriculture, mining and inland transport - requiring some 450,000 less workers;    otherindustries, including aircraft, railway rolling stock, clothing and footwear, 200,000 less;    while other sectors were estimated to require an extra 1,450:, 000 workers, the major claimants beingmechanical and electrical engineering, construction, public

administration, health,  education and other services.    Therehave been large movements of labour in the past.    But withtotal manpower going up very slowly in the next five years itis particularly important to get labour redeployed from whereit can be spared to where it is needed.    It is important thatthis redeployment should be planned so far as possible inadvance.19.    The investment planned by manufacturing Industry as a wholeseems to be on the low side for the growth programme (see chapter 5).    Unless, therefore, investment plans are raised,there is a danger of insufficient increases in productivity and manpower shortages, as well as of insufficient capacity to export and to compete with imports.    Import studies carried outby the Economic Development Committees and by the national economic Development Office have brought out the way in whichinsufficient capacity, or insufficiently labour-saving capacity,has led to large increases in imports of manufactures whendemand has increased substantially in the past;    examples arechemicals, paper and board, steel, cement, machine tools,bearings for vehicles.20.    The Industrial Inquiry and the work of the economic development Committees have helped to pin-point specific areasof strain and the problems that have to be resolved for thegrowth programme to be achieved.    To each of these problemsthere corresponds an opportunity.    The ways in which they arebeing tackled, industry by industry, are described in laterchapters.    One example is the construction industry where asubstantial growth is required to meet our needs for productiveand social investment,    A rapid expansion is also required inthe engineering industries which have a major role to play inmodernising industry and improving the trade balance.    Specificproblems have also been revealed In this field, for example the impact of rapidly rising investment in the chemical industry on british chemical plant producers and constructors;    this matter is being jointly examined by the   Economic development committees concerned.    Then again the inquiry has given some indication of the future demand for various types of skills andof likely shortages.    This will help to guide the work of theIndustrial Training Boards and the Government Training Centres.

THE ACTION PaOGiiAtviME21.    The main problems that must he solved if we are to get more rapid and sustained growth have been described in thepreceding paragraphs.    The major ones - and they are clearlyinterrelated - are to restore the balance of payments to a soundposition,  to increase industrial efficiency and to close the manpower gap - by economies in the use of labour, throughproductive investment and in other ways, and by using more fully the labour reserves in the less prosperous regions.    Theprogramme of action to these ends is set out below.I.      Government overseas spending22.    The whole burden of correcting the balance of paymentscannot be borne by British industry alone.    The government intends to stop the increase in defence expenditure and will pay particular attention to net expenditure overseas which hasbeen growing rapidly.    A start has been made with the recentagreement with Germany on the &quot;offsetting of our expenditurethere.    The Government&apos; s defence policy will be described inmore detail when the Defence Review now in preparation is completed.23.    Cur aid to developing countries lias been rising at anaverage of about 10 per cent a year in recent years.    TheGovernment recognises the importance of the flow of aid fromdeveloped to developing countries in helping to stimulate thegrowth of the latter and thus to alleviate the serious povertyfrom which many of them suffer-    It is fully aware of the part which our own programme lias to play in this international effort.But the amount of aid we give must be subject to restraintwhile our balance of payments difficulties persist, and we haveto plan our aid so that the foreign exchange cost of theprogramme is kept to a minimum.

1,8 /9II.    Private investment abroad24.    As a result of capital exports in the past,  the value of ourprivate investments abroad has risen to about  10,000 million,including  4,000 million portfolio securities and  6,000 milliondirect investments.    These are a source of strength to thebalance of payments and they bring in a mounting total of earnings.    But the recent and prospective rate of capital exportswas greater than the balance of payments could support without aserious deterioration in our liquid position.    When it isnecessary to make a very large improvement in the balance ofpayments over a short period, it is reasonable that the capital account should make a contribution;    otherwise it would bedifficult to avoid operating indirectly on imports by a. severereduction in home demand several times that of the foreigninvestment foregone.    Some loss of future income from abroadmay have to be sacrificed in the interests of redressing theimmediate situation.25.    In these circumstances the Government has taken steps toreduce very substantially the net outflow of private long term capital.    It is estimated that exchange control measures announced in the budget and in July 1965 will save about 150 million a year whilst still permitting direct investmentswhich bring a rapid gain to the balance of payments;    and the combined effects of various tax changes will further diminish the attractions of investment overseas and also encourageforeign investment in this country.    The&apos; Government recognises,however,  the part which private investment con play In overseas development and has undertaken to keep under review the impact of these measures on the developing countries.III.    Re--allocation of Government spending26.    The Government has been engaged in a thoroughgoing reviewof the whole field of public expenditure,,    Changes have beenmade to ensure that total planned expenditure is within ourmeans and the pattern of Government spending has been rearrangedin a way that should encourage rather than impede the productiveeffort.    In particular, the decision to limit the defence budget to  2,000 million at 1964 prices,  compared with the figureof about  2,400 million planned for 1969-70 when the Government

1.9 /10took office, will release scarce high quality technical manpower and engineering capacity for exports, import-saving and domesticinvestment.    The changes already decided upon in the military aircraft programme should relieve pressure on the engineeringsector by releasing upwards of  1,200 million over the next tenyears of resources that would otherwise have been devoted to defence;    there has been some consequent increase in imports of aircraft bat this will not involve a significant foreign exchange cost for a number of years.    About two-fifths of all research and development expenditure in this country has been devoted to defence.    The diversion to civil use should contribute substan-tially to the rate of innovation and thus to the balance ofpayments.27.    In determining the pattern of government expendituregenerally,  emphasis will be laid on those forms which directlyassist economic growth, for example by speeding the applicationof modern technology in British industry, by improving training facilities at all levels and by easing the transfer of manpowerto where it is needed,IV.    Industrial policy to^improve efficiency and the balance of payments28.    The Government is pursuing a much more active policy than has hitherto been attempted of detailed co-operation with industryto improve efficiency and the trade balance.    For this purpose it is not enough to make a global assessment of the needs ofindustry.    Each industry has its separate features and problems.29.    The Economic Development Committees, which include represen-tatives of management, unions, the Government and the national economic Development Office, are therefore being extended tocover each major group of industry, and will have a major role to play.    In October 1964- there were nine Committees coveringL 3^7 Per cent of employment in private industry and commerce.There are now fourteen Committees covering   5,1/ per cent, andby the end of the year it is hoped that about Per cent of private employment will be covered.    In addition the Governmenthas recruited into the Department of Economic Affairs a staffof senior people with experience in responsible positions in private industry,    A new Ministry of Technology has also been

set up to co-ordinate and strengthen the machinery to acceleratetechnological advance throughout industry (see Chapter 4,paragraphs ).30.    The most immediate task, is to improve the trade balance,though this is closely related to the improvement of industrial efficiency generally.31 -    Import saving.    The work of the Economic development committees is already beginning to produce results.    For example,the Machine Tool Economic Development Committee has agreed a24-point Action Programme to improve the export/import balance.The Chemicals Economic Development Committee has suggestedmanufacture of products not at present made in this country which would reduce the import bill by some  30 million a year.The Mechanical Engineering Economic Development Committee isinitiating action to improve consultation between buyers andsuppliers., and so avoid unnecessary imports through ignorance of what is available in this country,    (See Chapter 4,paragraphs ).32.    Standardisation.    Additional production for export - and atlower cost - could be obtained fairly quickly, with existingequipment and manpower,  through greater standardisation andlonger runs.    In many industries the pattern of the british market seems to have produced a greater degree of diversificationof effort, proliferation of product and willingness to useexpensive equipment for short jobbing runs than in many other industrial countries.    The Economic Development Committees have therefore been asked where appropriate to examine urgently theprospects and problems of quick progress in standardisation and variety reduction.    This would involve a major effort by manysections of industry.    But it is a task which many companies have tackled with great success and to the very materialadvantage of themselves and their customers.33.    Ex-port promotion.    A A^ery wide range of government services are available to help exporters and a publicity campaign hasbeen carried out to make them better known,    The Government hasalready announced new measures to speed up the growth of exports.These included expanded credit insurance facilities ait reducedcost;    the Export Rebate scheme, whereby certain indirect taxes1.10SECRET

bearing upon exports are refunded&quot;    arrangements for enablingnew exporters to receive help from established exporters;Government financial assistance for trade missions and collectivemarket research;    increased participation in and support for overseas trade fairs and other promotional activities;    theestablishment of a Commonwealth Expert Council;    and theextension of the activities of the British National ExportCouncil by the establishment of Area Committees.    The directefforts of the Government and the British National ExportCouncil to promote exports are being complemented by the workof the trade associations, the Chembers of Commerce and theEconomic Development Committees.34.    The Government has asked these Committees to consider new measures by which an early and substantial increase in exportscould be achieved:    for example, by fund raising by their industries to support export promotion, and by the establishmentof export trading corporations to buy as principals from british manufacturers and sell overseas through their own marketingorganisations.    The Committees have also been asked to examineways in which the whole of their industries can make arrangements to secure a specific increase in exports by co-operative action.Where an immediate shortage is a limiting factor, it is hopedthat this can be resolved by additional investment or by betteruse of existing capacity.    Concerted action by industries could help to remove the fear of individual companies that an increasein their sales abroad might result in the long term loss of domestic customers to domestic competitors.35.    Quicker movement of exports.    Paster handling in themovement cf experts to Europe - now about  1,700 million a year -could open up important new markets now closed to us because we cannot compete on delivery times.    Greater use of air freight,of containerisation, and of new types of ship coulddramatically reduce transit times.    This will requireco-ordinated change all along the transit route - by industryin packing and routeing, by road and rail transport to the ports, by the docks and by the ship-owners.    The national economic Development Council has therefore set up a specialEconomic Development Committee for the Movement of Exportswhich brings together the users of the services and all thesuppliers.    Their task is to agree urgently on plans for

speeding up export traffic.36.   Rationalisation.    British industry faces the problem of thesmall size of many of its production units compared with thosein the United States and some other competing countries.    Thelowering of international tariffs through G-.A.T.T. negotiationssuch as the Kennedy Round and through economic groupings suchas E.CE. and E. P.T.A. means the intensification of international competition.    British industry must be organised so that it cannot only face but take positive advantage of this competitivesituation.    The scale of operations is very important tocompetitive survival and this seems likely to involve a veryconsiderable reorganisation of the size of the units of which british industry is comprised.    While the Government are intenton getting rid of restrictive practices and preventing the abuse of monopoly power in industry and therefore have taken powers to investigate mergers, they would not intend to use their newpowers.to hinder mergers which they were satisfied v/ould promote the greater efficiency and international competitiveness ofBritish industry.    Where the Government can assist in the promotion of these desirable developments they are ready to doso and in some instances they may wish to take the initiative in bringing them about.37.   Public purchasing.    Public authorities,  including the nationalised industries and local authorities, are large buyersof many types of goods.    Government can thus make an important contribution to the efficiency of the economy through theintelligent use of government contracts and by advising other public authorities.    A start has been made.    For example theMinistry of Housing and local Government has appointed aspecialist to advise local authorities on the use of indus-trialised building methods and to help to implement the work ofthe National Building Agency.    The Economic development committee for the Electrical Engineering Industries hasinitiated discussions with the Electricity Council, and work is going forward within government, on the best ways of usingpublic procurement to lower industrial costs, increasestandardisation and promote exports.38.    Industrial co-operation.    One of the tasks of the economic development Committeesiis to set standards within their industry

by interfirm and international comparisons and to see that thosewho find themselves behind by any particular standard ofmeasurement are given the help and information they need tobring themselves up to those standards.    The benefits of aninterchange of information have already been borne out in thework of the first nine Economic Development Committees wherethere is an outstanding spirit of co-operation and readiness tohelp in tackling the mutual problems and opportunities of theindustry.39.    Indus^trial management.    The most intangible and yet by far the most important factor in improving industrial efficiency isthe quality of industrial management.    There is now a growinginterest in management education, and it is expected that,in thenext few years the increased quantity and quality of managementeducation of all kinds will be making a real contribution.    TheGovernment is already providing support for a great deal of this work and will continue to take a close and active interest in it.The Government will also encourage the professionalisation ofindustrial management.    These questions are further discussed in Chapter 4, paragraphs / &quot;30-36/\V.    Manufacturing investment40.    To achieve the growth of productivity we need, and toprovide the capacity required for additional exports and import-replacement, there will have to be a large investment in manufacturing industry - probably larger than industry is nowplanning.    The Plan shows the need for an average increase in manufacturing investment of about 7 per cent a year in real terms from 1964 to 1970 (see Chapter 5).    Judging by experienceso far this year, the increase between 1964 and 1965 may be greater than this.    The outlook for 1966 is more uncertain.The probable growth between 1964 and 1965 is unlikely to be repeated;    and it is doubtful whether the engineering industriescould bear such a load, given the need for increased exports and import-replacement.    Nevertheless it is important to maintainmanufacturing investment next yee.r.41.    The Government has been studying the effectiveness of thepresent system of investment allowances.    They have concluded that it is necessary to provide better incentives to investment and propose to introduce measures to this end.

42.    It is also important that, in making investment decisions,businesses should not be unduly influenced by temporaryfluctuations and uncertainties. The Economic development committees have an important role to play in focussing theattention of industries and firms on demand two years and moreahead, including demand in export markets and in markets nowbeing supplied by imports, and on the growing shortage of manpower over the rest of the decade which will necessitatemore labour-saving investment if firms are to continue theirexpansion.43.    New productive investment by foreign companies,  especiallyin under-employed areas of the United Kingdom, will continue toplay an important part in the creation of new industrial investment.    A special effort will be made to attract those companies whose exports to Britain have already secured them a firm base in the British market,  to start local production.There will continue, of course,  to be regulation of theacquisition of control of existing British companies.VI.    Productivity, prices and incomes policy44.    The measures already described to improve the balance ofpayments cannot by themselves solve the problem unless ourcosts of production move more favourably than in the past inrelation to those of our competitors.    This will be helped bya faster growth of productivity and industrial efficiencygenerally.    But the rate of growth of money incomes of allkinds is also of   great   importance.    The contribution that canbe made to the balance of payments - and also to our living standards - by a successful and sustained prices and incomes policy is very great indeed;    for the favourable effect iscumulative, year after year.45.    The Government believes that only as a long term and comprehensive strategy within the framework of the national economic plan, and with full agreement and co-operation of management and unions, can a policy for stable prices and plannedgrowth of money incomes hope to succeed.    Agreement has in fact been reached, for the first time in this country, on the

? 2 2 1^objectives, the machinery and the criteria for such a policy,and these are described in Chapter 6.46.    The policy is how in operation.    While it will take time to change traditional attitudes, and while the scope for influencingevents in 1965 is limited by past decisions or existing commitments, the chances of success are good.    An encouragingstart has been made,    /&quot;insert examples at latest opportunity ^7VI^-    An active labour market policy47,    It is clear that Britain&apos;s place in the world is going to rely increasingly on her technological skill and that we cannot afford to have people with inadequate training and skill workingwell below their capacities.    The Industrial Inquiry revealedthe rapidly growing demand for skills of many types and thedanger that growth will be held back by shortages of theseskills.48.    The Industrial Inquiry also revealed the need for largemovements of labour between industries.    There will in additionbe substantial movements between firms within industries;    andif we are to have the faster growth which is technically feasiblewith new methods and new plant,  one of the symptoms will be more rapidly changing methods of work.    All this calls for measuresto assist those affected by change and to see that so far aspossible they gain from it.49.    For these reasons the Government has embarked on a whole range of new policies and these are described in Chapter 3.They cover redundancy compensation, the development ofIndustrial Training Boards, a further extension of government training centres, improvements in the Employment Exchangeservices and various other measures to help workers on the move.    The Government also intends to introduce a system of wage-related unemployment benefits.50,   The progress of industrial training will be kept under continuous review during the period of the Plan and if itappears that the present measures are not producing the levelrequired, then such further measures as are necessary will beput in hand.    The Government, the Economic Development Committees,1.15

the Industrial Training Boards and the Regional Councils andBoards will co-operate in. assembling comprehensive information on the availability of and needs for skilled labour.    Thiswill be used to assess training needs, to guide companiesconsidering the establishment of new plants in the variousregions, and to help an efficient redeployment of labour.    the ideal is that with any redundancy notification to a workershould also be a notification of the new jobs available to him.51.    These measures should encourage a wholesale attack on&quot;over-manning&quot; in industry.    The Industrial Inquiry revealed thepossibility of substantial increases in output, with existingcapacity and labour forces, through better utilisation oflabour.    In the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity,Prices and Incomes, signed on 16 December 1964? representativesof management and unions pledged themselves on behalf of their members to encourage and lead a sustained attack on the obstacles to efficiency, and to strive for the adoption ofmore rigorous standards of performance at all levels.    several important firms, with the co-operation of their employees,have recently achieved remarkable increases in productivity inthis way;    and a number of others have, in agreement with theunions, undertaken a major review of working arrangements intheir plants and are confident that large improvements can bemade.    But a much greater effort is required by all concerned,as an essential part of the policy for productivity, prices and incomes, to get rid of restrictive practices of all kinds.Till,    Regional Policy52.   An essential condition for the fulfilment of the Plan isthe fuller use of manpower in the less prosperous regions ofthe country.    The employment of an extra 200,000 by 1970 isthe target (see Chapter 3).    This will make a substantial contribution to closing the &quot;manpower gap&quot;.    At the same time a more even spread of employment throughout the country will help to avoid regional pockets of excess demand setting the pace in driving up costs and prices while there are stillunused resources elsewhere.

1.17SECRET53.    Regional policies nust also look ahead and lay the basisof self-sustaining growth in those parts of the country whichat present are too dependent on the old nineteenth centurygrowth industries which have recently been declining or growingonly slowly.    Short terra policy must be related to the longer term problem of securing a balanced regional development ofindustry, transport and housing in the context of a growingpopulation, both of people and of cars.    On present forecaststhe population of the United Kingdom will grow by 17 million over the rest of the century;    and it has been estimated thatthe number of cars on the roads will double in the next tenyears and treble in the next twenty-five.    This will make it all the more important to prevent the harmful effects of congestion, particularly in parts of the Midlands and theSouth East.54.    As part of the national plan, information has been collectedfor the first time on many aspects of the regions of thiscountry (see Chapter 8 )3    The building programmes of public authorities, looking five years ahead, have been broken down on a regional basis;    forecasts have been made,  on variousassumptions,  of future population changes and of the supply and demand for labour in. the various regions.    A special review isalso being made, looking well beyond 1970, to provide the basisof the perspective planning that is required now if the largeexpansion of population expected during the rest of the centuryis to make the maximum contribution to national economic growth and well being.55.    The central government,  together with the Regional councils and Boards that have been set up, will now use all this material,together with detailed local knowledge, to draw up regionalplans that are consistent with the national plan as a whole andwith each other.56.    Over the years a range of financial, fiscal and other measures has been built up to influence regional growth.    Someof these have been strengthened over the past year by theintroduction of controls over office building, the more vigorousapplication of existing controls on industrial development in the Midlands and ;the South East, by an extensive new programme of advance factory building and by the provision ofhew training and retraining facilities.

99^1M Id if57.    But this is not enough.    The Government therefore proposesin addition that the tetter incentives to investment mentionedin paragraph 41  above should include measures to secure a betterbalance of regional development.    /^&quot;Distribution of industrypolicy;    development of office employment;    public investment;government establishments;    special funds announced in connexionwith coal policy;    refer to Chapter 8^/THE PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH58.    Given past trends in productivity, the evidence of theIndustrial Inquiry, and the comprehensive range of new policiesthat is being initiated, it should be physically possible toincrease our national output at the rate proposed;    this is,after all, a relatively modest one compared with that achieved by many other industrial countries.59.    The balance of payments problem is a more difficult one.The measures outlined in this Plan to limit government overseasspending and private investment abroad, to release scarceresources and inventiveness from defence work, to tackle thetrade balance industry by industry, and in a wide variety of practical ways, to encourage productive investment and increaseindustrial efficiency generally, and to achieve a successfulpolicy for productivity, prices and incomes should enable usto restore a balance and build up a surplus sufficient to repay the debts we have incurred.    (This matter is discussed inquantitative terms in Chapter 7.)    There is inevitably, however,an element of uncertainty about the time required for these measures to take effect.    The need to protect the balance ofpayments and the position of sterling in the intervening periodmay involve some slowing down in the rate of expansion in thenext year or so.60.    This need not, however, preventthe achievement of the growth programme, provided private industry - both management and workers - continue to push ahead with the policies required to increase efficiency and redeploylabour.    Industry has a vital role to play in maintaining itsinvestment programmes and basing its investment decisions on along term view of the future.    Many firms already take this long term view, but the habit needs to spread more widely.    The1.18SECRET

SECRET on ..Government will Toe providing important new incentives toinvestment and any temporary period of slack should (as italready is by many firms) be regarded as an opportunity tore-organise and re-equip.    This will increase the nation&apos;total investment effort and thus its ability to maintainexpansion in future without the need for stop-go measures.61.    The Plan will be kept under regular review in the lightof developments and periodic reassessments will be made sothat the Government and industry can base their plans on thelatest information available.THE INDUSTRIAL PATTERN OP, GROWTH62o   A growth in national product of 25 per cent between 1964and 1970 (3.8 per cent a year) will not mean that all industry.esincrease their output at this rate.    Chapter 2 describes the expected changes, industry by industry;    these are related tothe pattern of growth of demand described in paragraphs 67 .to 76 below.63.    The science-based industries, and those producing capital equipment, have expanded faster than others in the past decadeand this tendency will accelerate.    Oil refining, chemicals,electricity supply, and telecommunications are all expected to grow by 8-10 per cent a year.    In absolute terms the biggestexpansion will be in mechanical and electrical engineering,where a growth of about 6 per cent a year will be required,compared with 4f per cent in recent years.    This expansion (andalso an improvement in the industry&apos;s international competitive position) is vital to secure the needed increase in exports and investment.    Within the engineering total the largestincreases are expected to be in machine tools and electronics(around 7-8 per cent a year).    The problems, and opportunities,of the engineering group of industries are discussed in chapter 9 .64.   Among the older consumer goods industries, including partsof textiles,  clothing, furniture, food and drink, relativelyslow growth rates of 2 per cent a year or less are expected,while coal output is.likely to decline from 193 million tons in1964 to 170-180 million tons in 1970.1.19 /20

65.    The construction industries will have to expand by about -g- per cent a year;    the problems involved are discussed in chapter 1 o .66,    In energy as a. whole, demand is expected to increase byjust over 2 per cent a year between 1964 and 1970.    The plans of the fuel industries will be sufficient to meet this demand,and to provide the necessary margin for flexibility to permitquick reaction to unforeseen changes in demand for the different forms of energy.    These matters are further discussed in chapter 11.THE USE OP Pd^SOURCES67.    The degree of Government influence on the use of resourcesvaries a great deal from one part of the economy to another.    Ina free society citizens make up their own minds how to distributetheir spending between the different kinds of consumer goods and services competing for their attention.    But other services,such as defence, education, health services and road construction,are provided collectively through Government agencies and a central political decision has to be made on the amounts to be spent on these.68.    Apart from its own spending decisions, any modern government must take an interest in the broad division of the national product between consumption for present enjoyment and investmentto meet the needs of the future.    This division is influenced by a great many decisions about investment and saving taken by private individuals and firms and cannot, therefore, be dictated by the Government.    But investment by the public sector, whichthe Government can control,comprises about 45 per cent of our total investment;    and the Government can influence privatedecisions by the incentives it provides to savings and investment,by its general financial policies and also through more informalconsultations with individual industries.    It is with thesequalifications in mind that the following table is presentedof the projected use of our increased resources during the Planperiod.    More details are given in Chapter 15.1.20

If the 25 per cent growth programme can be achieved itwill yield an increase in national product between 1964 and 1970of rather more than  8,000 million at 1964 prices.70.    Of this, something approaching  2,000 million will berequired to correct the balance of payments and to increaseinvestment in private and nationalised industry, the most rapid increase in investment being in manufacturing and construction.71,    This leaves rather more than  6,000 million to be divided between additional personal spending;   housing;    and public expenditure on defence, health, education, roads, etc.1,21SECRET    N

72.    Of this, personal spending is expected to take about 4,300 million, or over half the total increase in national production.    The rate of increase of personal consumption willbe slightly faster than the average of the past few years.    Theslowing down in the growth of consumption new being experiencedis a temporary phenomenon largely reflecting the need to close the balance of payments gap.    In later years the growth of consumption should speed up to a rate substantially faster than any we have been able to sustain in the past.73.    The average rate of increase in personal consumption overthe Plan period will be at a somewhat lower rate than that cfthe national product as a whole.    To a large extent this reflects the fact that a substantial part of the increase in the standardof living to be expected in an advanced modern community comesabout through rising standards in the public sector - bettersocial services, more and better schools, hospitals, homes,  etc.74.    Provision has been made for a housing programme rising to500,000 by 1970.    There will be a steady increase in public housing, which is the main source of dwellings to let.    private house-building will be encouraged to recover to the level ofabout 250,000 starts annually and the intention is to keep it at about that level up to 1970.    The Government&apos;s housing programme and policies are described in Chapter 17,    The ability to meet this programme will depend on carrying out improvements in theorganisation of the construction industry;    these are described in Chapter 10.75.    The Government has made a careful review of all the majorprogrammes of public expenditure.    These have been madeconsistent with the Chancellor&apos;s undertaking to limit the growth of total public expenditure to an average of 4i per cent a year at constant prices between 1964/5 and 1969/70.

&apos;       2 &amp; Qin to what the nation can afford,76c   As far as can be estimated at present, and provided thegrovrth objective can be achieved, it should be possible tocarry out these expenditure programmes without any net increasein tax rates between now and 1970, although changes in eitherdirection may,  of course, be necessary in the intervening years to keep the economy in balance.    Much will depend on the courseof personal savings.       The more people are prepared voluntarilyto limit the increase in their personal spending in the interestof higher real incomes later, the lower will taxation need to be.1.23

OorrigendumChapter 7, Balance of PaymentsPage 7.12, table 7.1:Please insert following note to figure of 200It is estimated that this figure would be about 285 million with a total defence budget of  2,200million (at 1964 prices).    The figure shown in the table thus assumes a method of reducing total defence expenditure from  2,200 million to  2,000 million which involves a reduction of about  85 million in expenditure abroad.

7.    THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTSlnti?odiacti^qnFor too long the U.K. hsuffered from a weak balance ofpayments.The last decade has seen not only a series of short-term crises hut also a weakening of the underlyingposition.Sterling was in difficulties in five of the last ten years.      On some occasions these difficulties sprangalmost entirely from capital movements.    On others they weregenerated by a worsening of the current account, and were met by sharp checks to economic expansion.     This has had adverse effects on productive investment;, and hence on our long-termgrowth potential.2,     It is our aim to break out of this vicious circle, andto introduce and maintain policies which will enable us to enjoy more rapid and more sustained economic growth.3.     In 1961+ the overall deficit rose to an exceptionally high level.      It amounted to  7^5 million, with the current and capital accounts each in deficit of about one-half of this sum,and would have been  800 million if we had not taken a waiver of the payment of interest and capital on the North Americanloans.k.     Part of the overall deficit can be accounted for by temporaryfactors.     There was an exceptionally heavy net outflow ofprivate long-term capital, which rose to  250 million from anannual average of about  90 million over the last decade.      Themain forces at work were a large increase in o?II investmentoverseas, and a reversal of the considerable net portfolio investment inflow of previous years into an outflow of nearly 60 million.5.     The current account deficit reflecteda very rapid rise in domestic demand, which included an acceleration in fixed investment nd abnormally heavy stock building.     This upsurge in demandled to ahincrease of no less than i1 per cent in the volume of imports7.1

&quot;between 1963 and 196U.     More than half of the increase wasin imports of industrial raw materials ana semi-manufactures,while imports of capital equipment formed a large part of theincrease in finished manufactures.     Shortages oi capacitywere a factor stimulating large increases in some imports.The increase in the volume of imports was reinforced &quot;by a4 per cent rise in import prices, especially of basic materials and food, which led to a temporary worsening in the terms oftrade;    this has since been partly reversed.6.     The Government has taken a series of measures to redress the position, and it is hoped that at least half the deficit will have- been removed this year.     Kone-thc-less,there is still a substantial imbalance to bo removed,  and the debt incurred in 1964 and 1965 will have to be repaid by theend of the decade.7.     The task of correcting the balance of payments andachieving the surpluses necessary to repay our debts, while atthe same time fostering the rapid growth of the economy, isthe central challenge we face in economic planning.Particular Features of Recent Trends in the United kingdom balance of Payments8.     There are four main features of the United Kingdom balanceof payments over recent years which should be noted.9.     First, there has been a heavy and rapidly growing deficit on the Government^ net expenditure abroad on both currentinvisible and capital accounts.     The deficit on currentinvisible account reached  1+30 million in 196k, more than three-times the level ten years ago, almost wholly due to large increases in military expenditure and aid.     At the same time,the net outflow of official capital (mainly or, aid),now running at over  100 million a year, is also much larger than it wasten years ago.7.2

7.3SECRET10.    Secondly, there has also &quot;boon a persistent net outflow ofprivate long-term capital.     This has averaged over  90 million a year for the last decade, hut rose to the high ieVol of  250million last year.     That was exceptional, hut even so there Woreindications that a substantial outflow v/ould continue.11.     Thirdly, our exports have &quot;been growing only slowly, at anannual average rate of about 3 per cent in volume over the last decade.     This has not been enough to sustain the rate ofeconomic growth of which wo arc physically capable.     Our exports,which are mainly manufactures, have also been rising much moreslowly than world trade in manufactures, so that our share of thovalue of teat trade has fallen from 20 per cent in 195k to underIk per cent in 196k.12.     Fourthly, our imports of manufactures have been risingrapidly.      Imports of finished manufactures have increased in volume by 12 per cent a year ovo-r th^ decade to 196k, and importsof semi-manufactures by about 8 per cent although part of this increase is attributable to tho trend towards importing goodsin the form of some-manufacturos rather than&apos;basic materials.13-     Just as tho fall in our shar^ of world exports or manufac-tures has been most rapid in the years of rapid expansion,so too has the increase in imports of manufactures been mostrapid in those years.     This suggests that part ox our difficultieson visible account are to be explained by shortages of capacityresulting from insufficient investment in the past, and from tooslow a rate of installing labour-saving machinery and ofincorporating new techniques.     some significant examples of this are to be found in chemicals, hearings for motor vehicles, and somesectors of the engineering field,  in particular machine tools.Policies1k.      It is essential, in order to repay our internationalindebtedness, to attain and maintain an overall surplus in our international accounts.

tic must look for improvement in all parts of the external balance.      Of particular importance are the policiesaimed at the four features of the balance of payments outlined above.i) Government Expend!ture15.     The Government has decided to restrain severely Wo majoritems of its overseas expenditure.     First, it intends to restricttotal defence expenditure in real terms tc the level of theI96I4./65 Estimates, and to bring about an absolute reduction inthat part which is incurred overseas.16      The grants and loans which make up the Government&apos;programme for economic aid,  also place a burden on thebalance of payments.     The Government is fully aware of theimportance of aid to the developing countries,  and is taking steps to increase the effectiveness of what aid it gives.It will, however, be necessary to oorutinise the aid programme with particular careso long as the United kingdom balance of payments is under such great strain and we are faced with the need to repay the overseas indebtedness recently incurred.ii) Ojfcjrsoas Investment17.     The extent of the capital outflow has not beencommensurate with what the United Kingdom could afford, and a/change of direction in policy towards overseas investment was essential.     There is a limit to the amount 01  overseas invest-ment which a country can afford.     Much of the benefit of overseas investment accrues tc the recipient countries,  andthe return from investment overseas is on average considerably less, from the point of view of the national economy, than thereturn on home investment.      Oui tax system has tended to givetoo favourable a treatment to overseas compared with domesticinvestment.     This is inappropriate when domestic fixed capital formation will need to take a rising share of gross national7.kSECRET

7.5SECRETproduct to procure the growth of output we need.     The benefits of overseas investment to the balance of payments - in theform of interest end dividend income, end of increased exportsof goods and services - are of course recognised, but in manycases those benefits accrue only over a longer period.     And ina time of acute strain on the balance of payments short-runconsiderations must to some extent prevail.     It is, therefore,reasonable to employ a reduction in net overseas investment as one of the means to bring about the required improvement in our external accounts.     The additional degree of deflation whichmight otherwise be necessary would depress domestic activityby a multiple of the foreign investment forgone.18.     The Government has already taken a number oi steps whichwill substantially reduce the net outflow of long-term capital,in the field both of Exchange Control and of taxation.     Thetightening up of Exchange Control, while still allowing direct investment which brings quick returns to the balance of payments,is aimed both at increasing receipts and reducing payments on capital account.     This will be achieved by new measures intro-duced in the April 1965 Budget:    the diversion to the reservesfirst of certain receipts of foreign currencies by U.K. residentswhich had previously accrued to the investment currency pool,and secondly of 25 per cent of the proceeds of sale of non-sterling currency securities held by U.K. residents.     these measures are expected to reduce the net outflow by about  100million in 1965-66.19.     In addition to these measures the corporation tax will affect both the outflow and. the inflow of private capital,though in this case the full favourable effect on our capital account is not likely to be obtained during the first few yearsof the- Plan period.

7.620.     United&quot; Kingdom investment abroad is likely to be discouraged because companies will be able to offset their overseas tax liabilities only against corporation tax, not against the income tax payable on dividends paid to shareholders.Companies will therefore be obliged to restrict the rate of growth either of the dividends they pay out to their share-holders,  or of the profits they plough back abroad, or to combine both policies.     The former will restrict the incentive,the latter the ability, to invest abroad.21.     Two other budgetary measures - the withdrawal of the overseas Trading Corporation scheme and of relief to UnitedKingdom investors from the underlying tax borne by the companiesabroad in which the;/ invest - will also tend bo reduce overseas investment.      The Government recognises, however, the part whichprivate investment can play in overseas development and has undertaken to keep under review the impact of these measureson the developing countries, as the Chancellor made clear inhis Budget Statement.22,     The Corporation Tax will also affect inward investment.Non-resident companies will pay Corporation Tax on profits earnedthrough branches in the United Kingdom, while subsidiaries ofsuch companies will pay corporation tax on their profits, andpayable to their parents.in addition will pay with holding tax. on dividends/The post-taxreturn on such investment will probably be higher under the new system, although much depends on the distribution policy of individual companies and the rates of withholding tax still tobe negotiated.     The new system should therefore encourageoverseas investment in the United Kingdom,(ijpleasures to Promote Exports23.     A great deal of help, advice and information on sellingabroad is available to firms from Government sources throughthe Expert Services Branch and the Regional Offices of the Boardof Trade, and through the commercial officers of the Diplomatic

Servicej and credit insurance for exports is available throughthe Export Credits Guarantee Department.     A continuous effort ismade by means of personal contact to make all the available-services more widely known and to encourage firms to make use oft no m *2k.     At the same time the Government has introduced a number ofnew measures designed to encourage and facilitate a speediergrowth in exports, some of them aimed particularly at smallerfirms that do not export or export little.     The Export RebateScheme was introduced providing for the refund of certainindirect taxation borne by exports amounting to about 2 per cent of the value of our exports or a total of more than  80: million perannum.     Of this it is expected that, for example,  about  10&quot; million will go to the motor industry:,  5i rillion to the electrical&apos;machineryindustry and  1 million to the whisky industry.    Credit insurancefacilities have been greatly improved by expanding E.C.G.D.fs BankGuarantee facilities and by halving their cost, by reducingpremium charges and increasing percentage cover.     A list of somekOO established exporters willing to help firms making comple-mentary products to export has been compiled and published as abooklet - the so-called Pick-a-back scheme - which has been given a wide circulation.      Government finance has been made available through the British Rational Export Council to encourage industryto send selling missions abroad and bring buying missions to britain and to support collective market research abroad bysections of British industry.     A study is being made of the feasibility of setting up a new form of export selling organisation which will give     special attention to the needs of those smallerat presentcompanies which/export either very little or not at.11 o7.7

7.825*      In addition, the Board of Trade has substantially increased its participation in and financial support for exportpromotional activities overseas and an extensive programme ofover sixty trade fairs and nearly forty British Weeks andstore promotions is well advanced.     The Commonwealth ExportCouncil has been established and the activities of the B.N.E.C.extended by the setting up 01 ten Area Committees concerned with different parts of the world.     Many special meetings have beenmeld between Government Departments and industry to considerindustry&apos;3 problems in promoting and expanding exports, and close liaison is being maintained.26.     The direct efforts of the Government, helped by theB.N.E.C., to encourage and facilitate exports are being com-plementdd by the work of trade associations and chambers ofcommerce and by the Economic Development Committees.     Most ofthese committees have under review ways  (described more fully in chapter k) of increasing the exports of their respectiveindustries, notably by providing additional production forexport, by co-operative sales promotion schemes, the wider aseof consortia and the raising of export levies to promote overseasS 3.1 U S e27.     Delays in transit impose a significant handicap on united Kingdom exporters.      Eliminating auch delays is especially important in selling to Western Europe, an area which takesjust under kO per cent or our total exports and in which british industry is now at a disadvantage because we frequentlycannot quote delivery terms competitive with those of ourcontinental rivals.     Hence, the new E.D.C. for the Movement of exports, which brings together users and suppliers 01 all thenecessary services, has been asked as a matter of urgency toproduce agreed plans for speeding up exports.

Government and industry working through theEconomic Development Committees, have initiated measuresto contain the growth of imports of manufactures.Detailed studies undertaken by these Committees have ledto a set of programmes designed to eliminate particularobstacles to our ability to compete successfully withimports, in the fields of machine tools (with a twenty-four point action programme), of chemicals (with plans toinstal capacity to produce certain chemicals not yetincluded in the range of domestic output),and of mechanical engineering (with proposals to improve marketintelligence and thus avoid unnecessary imports throughignorance of what is available in this country).(v)     The Economic Environment29.     While the preceding paragraphs have outlinedmeasures directly affecting certain items in the externalaccounts, perhaps the most important policies influencingour external position are in fact those aimed at the domestic economy.      It is obvious, for example,  that exports will benefit from the greater competitiveness,higher investment, and higher productivity on which thewhole growth plan is based.     At the same time, suchpolicies will also improve our- power to compete withimports.30.     Furthermore, the cuts in certain forms of defence expenditure will release capacity, skilled, labour andhighly qualified engineering and design staffs for other work, thereby increasing the competitive power ofBritish industry, and providing   -valuable resources which the export industries can absorb in their response to export incentives and. world demand.7.secret^

&quot;     % 331.     Finally, the impact of a successful prices and incomes policy on the rate of rise 01 domestic prices and costs, whileof great importance in dealing with the domestic stresses andinjustices of inflation;  is of    great   importance to our international competitive position.      It is unlikely that we will he able to achieve the required increase in exports andto contain the growth of manufactured imports unless our costs and prices move more favourably than in the past in relationto those of our competitors.The Prospects32.     The origins of our difficulties arc deepseated and thebalance of payments deficit in 196k was of formidable size.But considerable progress towards equilibrium has already beenmade, and the important changes of policy which have alreadybeen made should create conditions in which the balance ofpayments problem can at last be mastered.      The Plan is notinflexible, and if progress on external account should not be suffiently rapid further steps will be taken to accelerate the improvement.33.     But just because so many new measures have been and arebeing introduced,  the normally hazardous task of forecastingeconomic events especially as far into the future as 1970,is made extremely difficult.     What is obvious is that we cannotsimply extrapolate past trends.      Indeed it is precisely thepurpose of many of these measures to alter those trends, and thereby to set the economy on to a new path.     Nor is there oneunique solution to the problem.     Each part of our externalaccount has its role to play - and tho objective set can be attained in a number of different ways.      In the section thatfollows we show the general linos of a satisfactory balance ofpayments in 1970.7.10

7.113Ll.     It iss however, difficult to ho precise about the timing of the effects of these policies and measures.     With the need to achieve balance in the course of 1966, and to earn an&quot;adequate surplus yoar-by-year thereafter, the rate of growth of the economy in the next year or so may have to be slower than the rat^ of growth of capacity or than the rate of expansion in later years.35.     Already there are signs that the policies to restoreexternal balance arc beginning to bear fruit.     For example,the deficit on the trade balance in the first half of 1965 was little more than one-half the rate of 196U.     In the first quarter, the deficit on the capital account remained large, butthis is expected to be greatly reduced in the second quarter.A start has also been made in reducing the balance of paymentscost of defence expenditure abroad.     Agreement has been reached with the Federal Republic of Germany on the offsetting of our defence costs in Germany;    as a first step a deposit of 41 million has been made which is expected in due course to financeadditional United Kingdom exports.The Balance in 1970[i) The Overall Surplus Required36.     We shall need to repay during the years 1967-1970assistance amounting to  900 million from the international monetary Fund and from Switzerland.     These obligations create the need for a substantial overall surplus in the balance ofpayments over the years concerned.     No precise figures can beput on the surplus that will be necessary;     its amount will depend on the extent to which short-term capital returns toLondon with the restoration of confidence as well as on thebalance of payments of the Overseas Sterling Area.

This coversdiplomatic and administrative expenditure and the repayment of earlier loans under the aid programme, plus certaindefence receipts.7.12for planning, it has been thought prudent to assume that a surplus of  250 million will he necessary   in 1970.      If weallow for a positive balancing item of  50 million., this wouldrequire an identified surplus on current and long-term capital account of  200 million,i) Government Expenditure Abroad37.     Table 1  gives estimates of net Government current and capital expenditure abroad in 1970 compared with 196k in 196kprices.     The figure for military expenditure in 1970 isappreciably below that in 196k.     Economic aid to developing countries is assumed to increase rather     less fast than thenational product.Only a proportion of this expenditure is a net drain on the overallbalance of payments, since much of the aid is tied to united Kingdom goods and services and, where untied, some willin any case be spent on them.(1 )38. Total net external expenditure on Government accountfalls by about  30 million, at constant prices, from  550 &apos;million in 196k to  520 million in 1970TABLE 7.1GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ABROADIs millicm^ 1 gSTT^prices&quot;&apos;,

Private Long-term Capital39*      It is difficult to estimate at all precisely how theprivate capital account will develop over the coming years.A substantial falling bach in net investment abroad from thehigh level of 196h was in any case to be expected, given the exceptional transactions in that year.     The new measuresdescribed (in paragraphs23-27abcve)iri 11 certainly carry theprocess further,  and by the end of the Plan period the normalsituation may well become one in which private investment inthe United Kingdom from abroad exceeds private investment bythe United Kingdom overseas, even though the latter isexpected to remain substantial.     As a basis for planning,it seems reasonable to envisage a net private inflow of theorder of  100 million a year by 1970.     This compares with anaverage net outflow of about  60 million in the five years1960-6hPrivate Invisible Trarisact2 cmshO.     The net surplus on private invisible transactions hasaveraged  kOb million in 1955-1959 and  515 million in1960-196k, reaching  610 million in 196k.      It has been estimated at  700 million in 1970 at 196k prices.      this improvement on 196k is the outcome of a wide range of factorsoperating on different parts of the account.     The main items are discussed in the following paragraphs.k1.      In the transport sector, the shipping account   hasshown, in recent years, a small deficit, and civil aviation,a moderate surplus.      Greater productivity in the wholeeconomy as well as in the industries concerned7.13

together with a successful incomes and prices policy can help to improve the performance of both these industries,especially to the extent that they seize the opportunitiespresented by growing overseas trade.     Receipts and payments on shipping may therefore be expected to be roughly in balance, while the surplus on aviation should grow.L2.    Expenditure on travel services must be expected to riseat a high rate, although probably less fast than the very rapid expansion in the early years of this decade.      On theother hand, an improved United Kingdom cost position can contribute ,&apos; to the growth of the Britishtourist industry and thus to a substantial improvement in ourearnings.      On balance, the deficit on the travel account isexpected to continue to rise somewhat.2+3.     The already large surplus on &quot;other services&quot; - a bigmiscellaneous category - can be expected to grow further.Of particular significance in this category are the financialservices associated with &quot;the City&quot;.      It is clear that theUnited Kingdom has a well-established position in supplying the banking, merchanting and insurance facilities which are a fundamental part 01 the City!s expertise and a major con-tribution to the balance of payments.     With increasingopportunities in a growing world economy, we can expect thelarge surplus on these transactions to rise further.2+I+.     The development of interest, profits and dividends is extremely difficult to predict,  since there are so many off-setting forces at work.     A more competitive and more rapidly growing United Kingdom economy ought to attract overseasdirect and portfolio investment, and thereby increase theincome due to be paid abroad.      On some existing foreign-owned assets in this country, moreover, the effect of theCorporation Tax seems likely to increase the amounts avail-able to pay dividends abroad.

I15.     On the receipts side, the rate of increase of our creditsis likely to &quot;be adversely affected &quot;by the slowing down in thegrowth of our stock of overseas assets due to the new exchange control measures and the Corporation Tax.     Nonetheless the net result, certainly within the Plan period, seems likely to he a continuing, hut limited, growth in our net income from abroad,because our existing stock of overseas assets is so much larger than the stock of overseas assets in the United Kingdom.Interest received on inter-governmental loans made by the UnitedKingdom in the past and on trade credit are also likely to go on increasing.7. 15

7.16SECRETnVisible trade+6.     The items covered so far would show a net favourable balance of  28 0 million in 1970, with a net inflow of private capital of  100 million and net earnings on private invisibletransactions of  700 million more than offsetting government expenditure abroad of  520 million.     To secure the identifiedoverall surplus of  200 million mentioned in (i) above, or 250 million before allowing for the balancing item, the deficit on visible trade would have to be reduced to  80 million.Although this represents a very considerable improvement corn-pared with the  550 million deficit recorded in 196k, it is aswing of only some  80 million compared with the average deficit in the previous decade of  160 million.      The prospects of agreat reduction in the deficit      in visible trade are discussed in the following paragraphs.Exportsh7.     Over the past decade, the volume of United Kingdom exportsrose by an average of about 3 per cent per annum.     Allowing forthe changing geographical and commodity composition of our exports - a growing proportion of our overseas sales now goes tothe more rapidly expanding markets and consists of goods forwhich demand is growing relatively fast - an extrapolation of past trends would lead us to expect a rise of not fa:,  short of k per cent per annum in the future.       Indeed,  in the firsttnree years of the original National Economic Development Councilgrowth programme, 1961-196k, the volume of exports did rise atthat rate.k8.      It ought certainly to be possible to improve on thisperformance in future yeais.     During the last decade the volumeof world trade in manufactures increased at rather more than per cent a year, with the exchange of manufactured goods between

the industrial countries the main expansionary element.      Thegrowth of demand in Western Europe may slow down somewhatduring the rest ox the 1960s after the very rapid increase inthe last ten years, hut the United States economy seems likelyto continue growing at the faster rate of the past few years,and thereby keep world demand no less buoyant than in the last decade.I4.9.     The ability of the primary producing countries toincrease their imports will depend on their export earnings andthe inflow of long-term capital,and,  in the case of the developing countries, on their receipts of aid.     These in turndepend closely on the rates of growth and the policies of theindustralised countries.     It seems reasonable to expect   theof the developing countriesimports/to continue to increase slowly over the Plan period.50.     We cannot avoid great uncertainties in assessing worldprospects so far ahead.      In the immediate future, some siowing-down in the rate of growth of world trade seems likely, but inthe longer run the rate of expansion should not be significantlylower than in the recent past.     There should therefore be nolack of opportunity for- a substantial increase in the rate of growth of United Kingdom exports.      The evidence 01 theIndustrial Inquiry suggests that British industry itselfexpects a big improvement in our export performance.    Theresults imply a rate of growth of United Kingdom exports (in volume) of slightly over 5t per cent per annum, which in turnwould mean the share of exports in manufacturing output rising from 25 per cent to about 27 per cent.51.     The prospects for each industry&apos;s exports were animportant question asked in the Inquiry;    the replies receivedare summarised in Table 2.     About half the industry groupsexpect a noticeable improvement in their export performance, asa result of recent&apos;or prospective changes in the structure oftheir industry,  or of their markets or of their products.7.17SECRET a- -

The figures thus derived for exports in 1964 differ somewhat from estimates made by industriesparticipating in the Industrial Inquiry of their exports in 1964?    theaifferences, however, were genera.lly fairly small.JMustry exports for 1970 were obtained by applying the 1964-70percentage growth forecast by each industry to the appropriate 1964export figure shown in the first column.     Where Industrial InquiryI estimates were available for a substantial proportion, but not thewhole, of an industry, the rate of growth of the parts for whichestimates had been made was taken to apply to the whole,     As can beseen from the table no estimates have been made for certain industries,aid thus the total in the Last row excludes these.

52.     Both electrical and mechanical engineering forecast amuch faster growth of exports than during the last five years.These results are expected to arise from rationalisation ofproduction and of standards aria from increased investment/.The international rationalisation of standards is a hey factor-too for electronics and scientific instruments, even in the face of strong competition.      Both woollen textiles and clothingexpect to increase the rate of growth of exports as a result ofmore modernisation of their capital equipment, and (in thelatter case)  of very competitive pricing.      The paper and hoardindustry expects to raise the rate of growth of exports, inparticular by switching sales efforts towards the Common Marketcountries, and by further developing more specialised andsophisticated products.53.     That part of the textile industry based on cotton andman-made fibres expects to increase    its exports after a fallin recent years.     This is the anticipated result of vigorousrationalisation of the structure of the industry,  and of new investment and of new methods currently being introduced by thetwo large man-made fibre producers.5d.     The industries mentioned mainly see their improvedprospects in the export market as resulting from factorsparticular to their own industries, particular investment projects, or new techniques.      General assumptions underlying the export forecasts were the Plan growth rate for the economy as a whole and world market prospects broadly in line withpast experience.      Some industries made it clear that their ability to secure the rise in export sales they were fore-casting was subject to certain more specific conditions,which will need to be further considered by the Government andthe industries concerned.7.18

7.19SECRET55.     A rise of United Kingdom exports by just over 5i? percent per annum is, of course, substantially above the rate of growth achieved in the oast,  and the fact that this projectionis based on industrial evidence should therefore not be inter-preted as implying that the attainment of the higher growth rate will be easy.      On the other hand, it would be equallywrong to regard a higher export growth rate as beyond ourreach.     Industry       itself does not think so, and many of our competitors have enjoyed average rates of growth of exports substa-ntialtyhigher than that now being projected for the United Kingdom.Given the industrial evidence,  the continued favourable outlook for world trade and the success of the policies adopted by theGovernment and put into effect in cooperation with industry(cf paras .23-27above), it seems reasonable to project a growth rate of 5z per cent  per annum in the volume of  our total exports,or slightly less than that resulting.from the Industrial Inquiry.

7.20SECRETImports56,    Over the ten-year period 1954-64 United Kingdom imports oilaverage rose by 5 per cent per annum in volume (and slightlyfaster in value)0     During the more recent past (l960-64) thevolume increase was just under 4 per cent per annum.     The increases in import volumes of the main constituent commodity groups have,however, varied considerably,      Imports of food, drink and tobaccoand of basic materials rose relatively slowly, while imports offuels and of manufactures, especially finished manufactures, grewrapidly,57.   The fast increase in imports of fuels reflects the growinguse of oil as a source of energy in the United Kingdom economy.The rapid rate of growth of manufactured imports from the relatively low level prevailing ten years ago was to some extent due to the progressive removal, substantially complete by 1959-, of quantita-tive restrictions on such imports,     Moreover, there have also beenmany reductions of tariffs.     Particularly important have been thetariff cuts on imports from the other members of E.F.T.A,;    since 1st January 1965 duties payable on E,F.T.A. imports have been only30 per cent of the general rates..58,    It is clear that a reduction in the rate of growth of importsof manufactures must play a prominent part in the improvementneeded in our balance of payments.     The National Economic Develop-Council and the Economic Developmentment/Committees have taken a number of steps with this end in view(see paragraph&quot;  28     ).     Moreover, the measures adopted to improve the efficiency and. competitiveness of the economy generally(cf, paragraphs 29-31 ) will, of course, also help to keep down the increase in manufactured imports,59.   The Industrial Inquiry included a set of questions on importsof manufactured goods.      The replies received suggest that importsof finished manufactures will continue to rise strongly, thoughless fast than in thelpast;    the rise in imports of seni-manufacturos

is expected by industry to slow down substantially.     The average rate of growth of imports of finished manufactures indicated by    gthe Industrial Inquiry is about 3 per cent per annum in volumeover the period 1964/70 compared with 10 per cent between I960 and1964;    in the case of semi-manufactures, the estimated rate of growth is just under 4 per cent per annum compared with 5 i percent between I960 and 1964.60o    industrial estimates of imports of manufactures six yearshence are subject to a ps.rticula.rly large degree of uncertainty,as foreign supplies generally represent the difference between two very much larger figures - the size of the total market and home sales by British manufacturers.      In estimating 1970 importsof manufactures some account was therefore also taken of pasttrends as modified, on the one hand, by the assumed fasterexpansion of total demand, and, on the other, by the adoption ofvarious policies and measures which should tend to reduce thegrowth of imports in this category (cf, paras. 26 - 29 above).Allowance was also made for imports of military equipment not covered in the Industrial Inquiry.     The resulting estimates are,for semi-manufactures, an average rate of growth of 5h per cent per annum and for finished manufs,ctures, a rate of increase of just under 9 per cent per annum.61.   Faster economic expansion will tend to result in consumptionof energy rising somewhat more rapidly than in the past, but asi owing-down is nonetheless expected in the rate of increase ofimports of fuels.     This is because the scope for further displace-ment of indigenous coal by oil is likely to become more limitedas it increases its importance in a number of markets;:    moreover,the expansion of United Kingdom refinery capacity will result ina higher proportion of fuel imports consisting of crude oil (whichis cheaper than oil products).      The average increase eepectedover the period is just over 5 per cent per annum at constant7,21

&amp; S3 .-wprices as compared with 7-1 per cent per annum between 1960 and1964.62.   Over the last decade imports of food, drink and tobacco on average rose by 2-g- per cent per annum in volume.      In the more recent past, however, imports in this category increased much less fast;    between 1960 and 1964 the annual rise in volumeamounted to only about 1 per cent per annum.     This more gradualtrend is expected to continue,     A population growth at much thesame rate as that over the past decade, coupled with some continuedincrease in the output of home produced food, will result in a relatively moderate rise in imports of food.      Imports of tobaccoare expected to be held back by only a minor rise in tobacco con-sumption, which in turn reflects the effect of recent anti-smoking campaigns.     It is expected that imports of drink willcontinue rising at much the same rate as in the past.     The annualrise of imports In the food, drink and tcbaaco groups as a wholeis estimated at about 1 per cent per annum between 1964 and 1970,63.    Imports of bs,sic materials also rose much less fast during1960/64 than over the longer period 1954/64 - 0,1 per cent perannum as compared with 1.2 per cent per annum.     Over the fore-cast period, however,  the rate of growth of this group of imports is expected to revert to that obtaining over the longer run, sincethe forecast slowing down in the rate of increase in imports of semi-manufactures in relation to industrial production will leadto some substitution by imports of basic materials.640    The resulting figure for total imports (see Table 3) is anannual increase (at constant 1964 prices) of 4 per cent.65.    It is thus expected that over the forecast period the volumeof imports will rise at much the ramie rate as during 1960/64,7.22SECRETN

The reasons for the implied change in the relation-ship between the growth of output and the growth of imports have largely been discussed in the paragraphs dealing with the mainindividual commodity groupie.     However, a further fa.otor is thelevel of imports in the initial-year of the Plan period.    imports in 1964 are thought to have been above their long-term trendsowing to heavy stock building in that year and the rapidity of theupswing of the economy during 1963 and 1964-      It follows that the trend increase of imports from 1964-70 is expected to be somewhat higher than the actual increase - between 4-g- and. 5 per cent perannum as compared with 4 per cent as shown in the table.TABLE 7.3(  million,  1964 prices)	1 964	1970	Per cent			per annumPood, drink and tobacco	1,758	1,878	1.0Basic materials	1,119	1,210	1.3Fuels	585	790	5,1S em i -manuf a c t ur e s	1 ,325	1,830	5.5Finished manufactures	899	1,480	8.7Total (c.i.f. )	5,686	7,180	4.0Total (f.o.b.	5,024	6,350	4.0yi) The balance of visible trade66.

15.    THE,,&apos;USE..OF RESOURCES1.     Table 15.1  sets out in broad terms the changing use of resources between 196k and 1970.    A 25 per cent growth in output would mean an increase in national product of rather more than 8,000 million at 196k prices.   Of this,  something approaching 2,000 million will be required to correct the balance ofpayments and to increase productive, investment in private and nationalised industry.    Of the remainder only a small increasehas been included for defence expenditure.2.     This leaves about  6,000 million to be divided betweenadditional personal consumption, private and public housing, andother public civil expenditure on goods and services, on bothcurrent and capital account.    In total this represents anincrease of about 23 per cent between 136k and 1970 for these purposes.   Public civil expenditure is expected to increase by28 per cent, housing by 32 per cent and personal consumption by21 per cent.3.     More details of the estimates are given in the following paragraphs.Balance of paymentsU.     The country&apos;s basic objective in this field must be to remove the present overall deficit and. replace it with a surplus large enough to repay the debt recently incurred.    The means of achieving this are discussed in Chapter 7.   A very substantial contribution must come from the long-term capital account.   the deficit here was abnormally high in 196I4. ( 370 million against apast average of  150 million), and in addition the measures announced in the Budget to limit private investment abroad willmore than offset the increase in aid to developing countries;this will have to be much slower than in the past until the15.1

15.3SECRETbalance of payments has been restored to a sound position.   To theextent that the balance of payments is improved by this meansthere will be no additional claims on our resources.5.     It also seems reasonable to take credit for a smallimprovement in the terms of trade compared with 196k when world prices of food and materials appear to have been abnormally highin relation to the prices of manufactures.   Our terms of tradeare already 2 per cent better than in 196k as a whole and this improvement seems likely to be maintained or increased.6.     Taking all these factors into account,  it is estimated thatan improvement of  500 million at constant prices in the balanceof trade in goods and services and net investment income fromabroad will be needed between 196k and 1970.    Taken in conjunctionwith the expected changes in other items of the balar.ce ofpayments, this should be sufficient to meet our objectives.Investment7.     Investment by private and nationalised industries is expectedto increase by about 35 per cent,  substantially faster than thenational product.8.     In the nationalised industries, despite large proportionateincreases programmed for the Post Office, gas and the docks, total investment is forecast to go up comparatively slowly, and considerably more slowly than in the past.   A major factor is alevelling off in electricity investment after 1966.   For allnationalised industries taken together the whole increase in investment is expected to take place during the first two yearsof the plan period.9.     In private industry the estimates allow for an increase in manufacturing more rapid than in the past, and higher figures thansuggested by the Industrial Inquiry.    Investment by the distributive trades is expected to increase rather less rapidly than in thepast;    and investment by property companies and financial

institutions is assumed to grow considerably more slowly as theboom in office development comes to an end.   Details of the expected changes in investment by private and nationalised industries are given in Chapter 5.10.   stock building was unusually high in 196I4. and approximately the same figure has been allowed for 1970 despite the higher levelof output in that year;    this has been calculated on the basis of past relationships between the growth of the national product andstock movements.Defence expenditure11.   The C-overnment is planning on the basis of limiting defence expenditure to the level of the Estimates for 196k/65 at constant prices.    This represents a reduction of  k00 million compared withthe programme for 196C/70 when the present Government took office.(Since the 196k/65 estimates were underspent there will be some increase over the actual level of expenditure in 196k.)0ther public expenditure and housing12.   To reach a programme of 500,000 houses in 1970 will involve an average increase in expenditure of I4..8 per cent a year from196b to 1970 on investment in housing.    (The housing programme is discussed in Chapter 19.)    Investment in social and other public services (roads,  schools, hospitals,  etc.) will rise by about55 per cent between 196k and 1970.    Current civil expenditure on goods and services will rise by about 28 per cent.    Both these increases are faster than that in the national product.   Publicservice investment is expected to rise particularly rapidly inthe early years of the period.Personal consumption13.   Achievement of the 25 per cent growth target would make possible an increase in personal consumption of about 21 per cent between 196k and 1970,  an average of 3.2 per cent a year.    Thisis   slightly faster than the 3.0 per cent a year average increase*15.k

15o5from i960 to 196k. In tennis of consumption per head the average increaseexpected from 196k to 1970 is 2.4 per cent per annum as against2.2 per cent from i960 to 196k.   But allowing for the changing agedistribution of the population there should he room for a more marked acceleration in the standard of living of the average workerand the average pensioner:    2.7 per cent from 196k to 1970 asagainst 2.3 per cent from i960 to 196U.    The reason for this isthat the proportion of retired people in the population will increase more rapidly in the future than in the recent past and (evenafteraallowing for recent improvements in pensions) those who haveretired tend to have a lower consumption per head than those atwork.Savings1U.   The value of the resources required for fixed investment athome, for the building up of stocks of finished goods, work inprogress and raw materials,  and for net investment abroad mustbe matched by domestic savings.    Savings are customarilydistinguished by the broad sector of the economy by which theyare made.    These sectors consist of persons  (including non-profit-making institutions),  companies,  the public corporations,  thecentral government and local authorities.15.   The projection of the level of savings as a whole for several years   ahead is inevitably subject to a high degree of uncertainty,depending on the development of the various components of money incomes and consequent price movements.    An examination hasnevertheless been made of the prospects for savings.    the assumptions made include a significant allowance for the effectof the Government&apos;s prices and incomes policy,  a continued steadyrise in the proportion cf disposable income which the personalsector devotes to saving,  and the maintenance of the rates of central government direct and indirect taxation made effective inthe 1965 Budget.    Although the last assumption is convenient for

v/orking purposes,  in practice rates of taxation are varied bothgenerally in order to match the prospective demand for resourceswith the resources likely to be available and specifically in the furtherance of economic and social policy objectives.    The use forthe purposes of projection of present (1965 Buclget) tax ratesimplies that the proportion of personal income taken by directtaxes would rise with general increases in money incomes, becausecf the progressive nature of the scales of income tax and surtax,but that the ratio of indirect taxes to expenditure would fall.16.   The result of the examination indicates that in 1970 thetotal of the savings by persons and companies and of the currentsurplus of the public sector as a whole,  implied by the assumptionsmade, is likely to be broadly in line with investment requirements.This tentative conclusion does not detract from the need toencourage savings.    The more rapid the rise in the ratio of savings to disposable income, the lower will be the taxationrequired.    In other words,  the greater the willingness of people to forego voluntarily present consumption in the interests of future developments, the easier will it be for the resources ofthe country to be directed to speeding up the rate of growth.Phasing[17.   The phasing of the growth of national output and the various forms of expenditure discussed above in the period to 1970 raise questions essential to the achievement of the plan.    The most critical ones are the development of the balance of payments,the course of productive investment in private industry and the speed with which productivity and productive capacity can beincreased.18.   All these factors point to a faster growth of output inthe latter part of the period than in the earlier years.   Theallocation of resources in the first part of the period willreflect the fact that the major part of the improvement in the15.6SECRET

15. secret*        Z 0 -3balance of payments will have to be achieved in the first twoyears or so (part of the necessary diversion of resources forthis purpose has already taken place).19.    The phasing of private manufacturing investment is uncertain,The Plan provides for an average increase cf about 7 per cent a year from 196k to 1970.    It seems quite probable that theincrease in manufacturing investment from 196k to 1965 may exceedthis.    The outlook for 1966, howeverP is more uncertain.    Thevery sharp growth probable between 196k and 1965 is unlikely tobe repeated; and it is doubtful whether the engineering industriescould bear such a load, given the need for increased exports,import replacement and the investment plans of the nationalised industries.    To the extent that the growth in investment in manufacturing is relatively slow in the next year or two, a more rapid rate of expansion will be needed in the later years of theperiod to ensure the planned rates of output in 1970.21.    The rate of increase expected or planned in other claims on resources will mean that personal consumption will increase rather more slowly than the gross domestic product over the period 2.36kto 1970.   Over the whole period the average increase is estimatedat 3.2 per cent a year in total;    but the rate of increase islikely to be slower than this in the early years and fasterin the latter part of the period.    In the latter part of the planperiod the achievement of a more rapid growth of output than in thepast should be correspondingly reflected in a more rapid growth in personal consumption.

18,      PUBLIC -EXPENDITUREPublic expenditure, as discussed in this chapter, includes allcentral and local government capital and current expenditure, withthe exception of debt interest, and includes the gross outgoings ofthe national insurance funds.     The capital investment programmes ofthe nationalised industries and other public corporations are treated separately, since they raise rather different issues;    andfor the purposes of this chapter, Exchequer advances to these industries are not included, in &quot;public expenditure&quot;:    the investment programmes of these industries are set out in Chapter.2.     Public expenditure so defined is estimated at over  11,500&quot;illion in 1965-66, and accounts for about [38 per cent] of theuse of the total gross national product.      It represents a wide variety of kinds of expenditure,  including defence and otherexpenditures in support of the Governments external policy;    thepublic services such as education, health, police;    the provisionof roads, houses, public buildings;    the national insurance benefits and national assistance;    support for agriculture, railways,industry in the development districts, etc.      Their size is deter-mined by decisions by the Government or by local authorities (orby both working together);    and they are paid for by centraltaxes, local rates, national insurance contributions,  or borrowingby Government or local authorities from the public.3.     The Government decided in November 196k to review the wholefield of public expenditure.     After a first examination of theprospects, they decided that the rise in public expenditure (ashere defined) should in the period from 196k-65 to 1969-70 belimited to an average of Utt per cent a year at constant prices.This was announced by the Government in February, and has laterbeen reaffirmed.     The review has been completed.      The Governmenthave decided on individual programmes which in the aggregate are within this overall limit.     For financial control purposes theexpenditure limit has been determined for 1969-70.     These figures18.1

have, however, &quot;been converted to give the expected expenditure in1970 for use in other parts of this document.Ij.,     This method of review thus involved, first, a decision abouthow much resources can be set aside for public expenditure(compatible with leaving an adequate amount for the strengtheningoi&quot; the balance of payments, private investment and private con-sumption);    and, second, a series of decisions allocating this total between the various elements of public expenditure.      To havedecided first how much public expenditure the country could affordand then how to lay this out to the best advantage may be regardedas a new departure in public finance.5.     In allocating the prospective resources in this way, five years ahead, the Government5 s main aim was to strike a reasonable balance between the essential but non-productive needs of defence and thesupport of external policy;    the provision of services such asroads and ports, support for industry and advanced technology, andthe improvement of regional balance,  all of which contributedirectly to economic growth;    and the extensive and. growing network of social services, which are not only an essential part of most people&apos;s total standard of living, but may also play an importantindirect role (e.g. through improving education and health) in helping economic growth.6.     Looking even as far ahead as 1969-70, the Government&apos;s room for manoeuvre is limited.     The development of the great public services of defence, education, health, roads, etc. is necessarilyplanned several years ahead;    for this is the time required to train skilled, staffs and to plan and build new capital facilities.Moreover, the reorganisation of defence must move in step with thedevelopment of foreign policy on the one hand, and the advance ofdefence technology on the other.     The 12-g- per cent increase inthe number of school children requires substantial additional expenditure and thus limits the extent to which standards can be improved.     A place must be found in the programmes for expenditures18.2

18.3SECRETwhich are directly beneficial to the national economy;    and clearly the Government have to take into account the impacts of variousprogrammes, both favourable and adverse, on the balance of pay-ments.7.     Nevertheless, the Government have been able to carry out aconsiderable reshaping of the public expenditure programmes, andthe decisions which have been taken for the period from I96I+-65 to1969-70 are set out in Table 18.1.

3,     Defence fcudRet.      The Governments review of defence expendi-ture is intended to limit expenditure in 1.6.-70 to  2,000 million at 196L prices, i ,e, to the same level as the 196U-65 Estimates.The previous estimate for that period was around  2,h00 million at196k prices.      The Government have announced decisions on aircraftprocurement and the future of the Army Reserves which will go aconsiderable way towards this objective:    the review continues,  andfurther decisions will be announced in the coming months.      Thetime-lag between defence decisions and expenditure is such thatthe 1966-67 Estimates will be higher, even at constant prices, thanthose for 1965-66;    and the reduction to the new level will notbegin to appear until the later years of the period.9&apos;     Roads.      The programme is a continuation of the five-yearprogrammes carried out by the ministry of Transport and theScottish Development Department together with the local authorities.It represents an increase of hl-g- per cent from I96I1.-65 to 1969-70,[Chapter       ],10o   Housing.     The capital expenditure figures, which provide anincrease of 33 pe^ cent from I96I4.-65 to 1969-70, are those oflocal authorities and new town corporations etc. in Great Britain,representing their component of the National Housing Plan aimed ata United Kingdom total of 500,000 houses in 1970.      [Chapter 17].11,    The total cost of housing subsidies (central government andlocal authority subsidies, plus improvement grants) will in anycase increase fast over the period, with the speed-up of public sector housing which has already taken place and which will be intensified in the latter part of the period.     Provision is also made for improved subsidies for local authority building, whichthe Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary ofState for Scotland intend to announce in October;    and some provision is made in 1969-70 for assistance to owner-occupiers.The total housing subsidy bill shews an increase of 6k per cent from 136I1-65 to 1969-70,18.5

12.    Police and prisons.     The estimates show an expansion of thecost of these services of 22 per cent in the five-year period.13.   Education.      This programme covers all education, primary,secondary, further and higher,  and represents an increase of32 per cent in the five-year period.      This is partly related to increased numbers, i.e, provision of teachers,  school buildings and equipment to match the expected increase of about 12-g- per cent from 196k to 1970 in the number of school-children (Great Britain);an estimated increase of around 33% in further education enrolments;and an increase cf about 30 per cent in the number of universitystudents from 196k to 1970.      It is related also to improvedstandards in all kinds of education.     In the aggregate, expenditureon education has increased from       per cent of the gross national product to per cent in the last decade, and will on this basisincrease to        per cent by 1970.      [Chapter 21].14&quot;   He a 1 th an d v/elf are .      The programme covers the whole of theRational Health Service, and certain related expenditures (e.g.welfare milk), and represents an increase of 23^per cent in thefive-year period.      The main elements are the continuing develop-ment of the hospital service, both the new hospitals and. theimprovement of services within the hospitals;    the improvement of conditions of GP&apos;s;    and a very rapid growth of local authorityhealth services.      [Chapter 20].15.   Benefits and assistance.     This is the largest of the pro-grammes, covering the national insurance benefits together with industrial injury benefits, war pensions, family allowances,national assistance.      The 1969-70 figure shows an increase over that for 196h-65 of  800 million or 38 per cent.     This represents the sums required to carry out the objective of providing benefitsimproving at the same rate as the national standard of living fora steadily increasing number- of old people,      [Chapter 22].16.   Other Programmes.      The programmes described in the previousparagraphs represent about 80 per cent of total public expenditure.18.6

The remainder include a wide variety of activities - support for agriculture, industry, the railways, advanced technology,scientific research, etc.;    a wide range of local authoritycurrent and capital expenditures, many of which will probably have to be slowed down to make room for the high-priority services;costs of public administration in Whitehall, in the town halls and overseas;    etc.     Provision is of course also made for NorthernIreland.     Overseas Aid is expected to go up at about the same rate as the expansion of the Gross National Product, but the exact level will depend upon progress with the balance of payments.17&apos;   Contingency allowance.     An allowance of  150 million is left for contingencies in 1969-70.     This allowance is necessary partly because of unpredictable changes of circumstances, and partly because of a tendency to uncler-estimate the future cost ofproviding for any particular defence or industrial or social policy.18.   Implementation of programmes.      The Government have establised for each main programme limits of expenditure for 1969-70 aftertalcing into account the expected implications of these limits onthe development of each service.      These limits now provide ameasure of the amount of resources within which each Department canplan its programme.      The developments of each service given inthe accompanying chapters represent the programmes that are believedat present to be practicable within the limits of the resourcesset aside for them,19.   These programmes must be flexible.      The allocations for1969-70 are designed as a basis for realistic planning, but theyassume a successful development of the whole of the economy on thelines indicated in this Plan.     The progress of the individual programmes depends upon, for example, the supply of manpowertanging from the most highly qualified specialist to the unskilledworker:    all depends upon the success of the construction industryin achieving a continuing increase of productivity and growth of output.18. secret

18.820.    It follows therefore that these programmes, individually andin the aggregate, must he subject to continuous modification inthe light of the development of the economy.      In a year&apos;s time,these allocations will be reviewed, and limits established for1970-71o      Thus, the course of the main public services will beregularly adapted to changing needs and to tho ability of thenational economy to satisfy them.
