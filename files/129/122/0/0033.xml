THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1965C- ^ 133 Copy No.     6 618th October, 1965CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME, 1965-66Memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIt is necessary at this time of year to review the legislative programme for the coming Session so that we may avoid givingundertakings in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament which we are unlikely to be able to fulfil. It is also desirable toestablish priorities in order to ensure that the resources ofParliamentary Counsel are concentrated on drafting the Bills whichwe must clearly have early in the Session.2. The Queen&apos;s Speeches Committee (which includes theMinisters on the Future Legislation Committee) has reviewed theprogramme approved by the Cabinet in July (C.C. (65) 35thConclusions, Minute 4) together with other Bills which it has sincebecome plainly necessary to add. The original programme with theseadditions would provide enough legislative business for a Session-and-a-half. We therefore sought to identify those Bills which, howeverdesirable, cannot be given priority, and to arrange the others intogroups to be introduced, respectively, before Christmas, in january and later, according to their intrinsic urgency and the progress whichhas so far been made in their preparation. The classification whichthe Committee recommend is set out in the Annex.3. The Committee consider it necessary to relegate to thereserve list Superannuation and Pirate Broadcasting; and to holdback Overseas Aid, Criminal Justice, Children and National Parks.This does not necessarily mean that it may not be possible to introduceone or more of these Bills late in the Session. It does mean that weshould get on with other urgent Bills first and accept the risk that thefour Bills in question may not be reached. If we cannot get criminla justice into the main programme I would hope that we should beable to take some parts of it in the form of separate Bills throughthe Second Reading Committee procedure.4. The Committee recommend the addition to the programmeof a Colonial Enabling Bill to enable us to confer independence, or anew status short of independence, on a Colonial territory by Order6200
in Council. We are unlikely to be able to find an opportunity tointroduce such a Bill much before Easter, but, although it may initiallytake more time in the House than individual Independence Bills, wethink that it is worth introducing in the present Session in the hopeof avoiding at least some of the Independence Bills which we shouldotherwise have to obtain before the Summer Recess.5. I ask the Cabinet to approve the priorities indicated in the annex.H. B.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,18th October, 1965.
