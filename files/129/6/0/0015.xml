THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT-Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 15.17th January, 1946.CABINET.CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Cabinet on the 13th September, 1945 (CM. (45) 31st Conclusions,Minute 1), gave general approval to my proposals in CP. (45) 146 for the treat-ment of conscientious objectors in the Civil Service now that the war is over,but deferred a decision on the date at which the ban on their promotion should belaised.2. The ban on promotion was imposed in order that civil servants who wereconscientious objectors should not obtain any advantage as compared with their colleagues in the Armed Forces. I consider, however, that it would be needlesslyharsh to maintain the ban until the last man returns from the Forces, and I had proposed (CP. (45) 146) that it should be removed on the 1st January, 1946.3. On reconsideration, and having regard to the rate of demobilisation. I now propose that the ban on promotion should be removed as from the 1st July,1946. The matter has recently been discussed at a meeting of the EstablishmentOfficers of the major Departments, and they, while feeling that the 1st Januarywas rather too early, thought that substantial justice would be done if eligibility for promotion were allowed as from the summer of 1946.4.   I ask my colleagues to agree to the 1st July, 1946./ II. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,17 th January, 1946.[31168]
