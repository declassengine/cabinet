DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY  -vO.    /ftjCABINETOUR FOREIGN SHIPPING RELATIONS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHSMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of War transport as the United Maritime Executive Board is meeting in london for its fourth and last session this week,  I wish my colleagues to he informed of the issues that confront us there.      I do not seek any immediate decisions on policy, &quot;but wish my colleagues tohave this background information in case I have to seek decisionsurgently. ,2.      Our shipping relations with other countries in the coming months are overshadowed by our dependence upon the United states for tonnage.      My Paper CP. (14.6)36 shows the extent of thisdependence.      First, 3,000,000 tons of our dry cargo shipping ison bareboat chai tor from U.S.A.      While we are temporarily assured of the continuance of these charters,  there is no certainty yetthat we may he able to retain them for any length of time-&apos;    andin any event the power of the U.S.   to withdraw these ships aishort notice leaves us in a very weak position.      Secondly, r yPaper shows- that I am counting on assistance from about 1,00C ,000&amp;.w.  tons of foreign flag tonnage in our programmes.      The bulkof this tonnage must -be supplied directly or indirectly by U,S.A.The European Maritime Nations have sufferer1 so heavily in thewar that tonnage to this Quantity is not now physically procurablefrom them.      The Scandinavian countries find &quot;themselves underthe necessity of importing&apos;substantial quantities of coal from america whi-fn absorbs waste fully an appreciable number of ships.Moreover,  there are other Nations  in the market for foreign flagtonnage.      On the other hand the U.8.  has nore than half theworld&apos;s dry ca^go tonnage resources and much of this is surplus toU.S.  requirements.      Thus,  in this respect also, U.S.   shippingpolicy has for  the time being a decisive influence over ourposition,  and that of other countries.3.      In. order to win hack our position on the seas,   it isnecessary to re-create as soon as practicable the conditions inwhich our competitive power can take effect-    and for this reasonwe must oppose attempts to eartelise or regulate shipping &quot;business on a world wide scale.      We are in no position at present; to cometo terms with any nation as to the extent of our participationover any long period of time either in the world&apos; s shipping;business at large or in particular trades.      On the other,   themain feature of U. &amp;&apos;.  shipping policy is to bring about such arrangements in order to establish a position for the U.S.  fHagand to use for this purpose her present control of so great a proportion of the world&apos;s shipping.      The reason for this policyis that in normal - conditions U.S.   shipping is not competitive(except perhaps in those liner trades where there is a largeproportion of high freight paying cargo).SECRETCP. (hS) U2UTH FEBRUARY.   1 9*4-6

U.      I do not suggest that in order to reinstate our shippinginterests it is necessary to drive the U.8.  flag from the seas,as Americans sometimes suspect us of desiring to do.      On thecontrary,  I anticipate that the U.S.  will he able,  without endangering our interests,  or those of other Maritime nations,to keep in employment a Merchant fleet,  operating to and from u.8.  ports,  somewhat larger than before the war,  even thoughsubsidies on some routes will be necessary.      But sooner or later,there is bound to be keen competition between the two flagsin some trades.    It is essential to oar economic interest thatwe should then have the advantage of oar competitive&quot;position:and essential to our political relations with U.S.A.   that suchrivalries should be settled in the commercial way and not madeissues of state.5.      The difficulties arise critically during the current session in London of the United Maritime Executive Board,  to which theU.S.  have sent a strong delegation.      The United Maritime Authorityends on 2nd March and the manor issue before us is, what arrange-meats for international shipping co-operation should succeed it.The shipping requirements of U.N. R. R.A.  and France and belgium and other countries in a like position undoubtedly require somecontinuance cf co-operation-    and seme special administrative arrangements to  avoid overlapping and delay.      If the merchanttonnage available in the world under all flags were effectivelyat the disposal of those who require it there would be more  thanenough to go round:    but the &quot;free&quot; tonnage of the EuropeanMaritime nations is very small in amount,  and the U.3.  Governmentin fact control the situation by being the principal suppliers ofthe tonnage.6.      The U.S. Delegation will not,  of course, put themselves inthe position of refusing essential shipping services-    but theymay seek no continue means of rationing it to users in such away as to promote their general maritime policy.      The mainfeature of their present proposals is that shipping nations shouldbe united to co-op-.rate in supplying a pool of tonnage,  to cover the requirements of U.N.R. R. A.   and the liberated countries.      Thisis a proposition which we cannot oppose, for it is a sensibleway of providing for these abnormal movements of cargo (and perhaps, for the time being,  the only way).      But it is full of difficulty for us&apos;.      By forcing substantial contributions on other maritime nations,  including ourselves,  the U.S.  can limit the amount cf tonnage these nations may be able to use in re-establishing their liner services,  thus limiting the competition with U. S.  shipping in those trades.      On the other hand, we have-established interests in the trades to be served by the pool and cannot he excluded fro.&quot;-: them.      In our own case,  there is theadded difficulty that our contribution might be stepped up so asto require us to call on more foreign tonnage for our ownpurpose s.

7.      By concentrating on the problem of supplying U.N.R.R. A.  andthe liberated countries,  the U.S.  proposal would leave therest of the immediate shipping problems of the world to besettled separately and would strengthen the U.S.  position in settling them.      The U.K.  Delegation in preliminary consultationwith them have made progress in bringing all the problems intorelation , and it seems possible now that a plan somewhat more acceptable to us may emerge from the open discussions in theUnited Maritime Executive Board.      I append (Annex) a copy ofthe Paper which the 11. K. Delegation lave submitted to the Board.Proposals have been submitted by the U.8. Delegation whichare acceptable to us on some points, but include the plan for a contributory pool of shipping in a, form which will need some considerable adjustment before we could safely accept it.Meanwhile, however,  the U.3.  and U.K.  Delegations are continuing their discussions.      It would be fair to say that,  though boundIn/ the generally restrictive   mature of their shipping policy,  theU. S.  Delegates are nevertheless sympathetic to our particular difficulties.    &apos;I;   these matters our close-relations with theU. 3.  shipping authorities during the war serve us usefully.Thus on short term arrangements, we may still hope to be able tocome to an understanding acceptable to us, and which will tideus over the next six months or so while our difficulties are most acute, without compromising our long term position.3.      Looking further ahead, however,  it is essential to us tostrengthen our merchant tonnage resources as rapidly as possible.We are building ships *    we must reduce the amount of our tonnagelocked up in military service-    and other European nations willmane progress with the rehabilitation of their merchant fleets.All these factors will help us to put us in a less vulnerableposition-    but from other sources we cannot replace for someyears the 3,000,000 tons of U.3.  shipping which we have under our flag on bareboat charter.      The U.3.  Ship Disposal Pill isnow in its final stages but it contains no provision for bare-boat chartering to foreigners, despite the intervention of thePresident to secure it.      I expect to be sble to make arrange-ments with the IJ. 3.  Government&quot;which will see us through thenext few months-    but if Congress persists in its refusal toconfer bareboat chartering powers, we shall have to buy.      Theissue between what we can afford from, our dollar resources forthis purpose and the coc^Sequences for our shipping position ofnot buying enough tor.na.-e to establish our independence, willbe difficult to&quot;decide.      I will not anticipate it, but warn mycolleagues that it may arise.A. B.Ministry of War Transport,    .7.1.,aTH FEBRUARY,  1 91+6.

;AIINEXUNITED AARITIi.,E EXECUTIVE ^jhimShip-ping Relations during the transitional period after the Termination of TheAgreement on principlesPajjjr b:y the U.K. Delegation.A.    General Observations1.     -The United Kingdom delegation suggest that in consideringShipping in the coming period Governments should start fromthe standpoint that their abject should oe to restore at theearliest practicable date conditions in which the supply andchartering of shipping services can proceed on a normalbasis as between those able to supply ships and those requiringtheir services.    These conditions arc in the interest bothof those nations which require the services of foreign flagtonnage and those nations which as a form of commercialenterprise have shipping services to offer.    During the warand the U..,:.A. period the heavy demands upon shipping formilitary and other emergency purposes   mu the conditions under which shipping has been operated (as regards for .*example,  the length of voyages,  the conditions in ports,  the congestion of repair facilities), have made necessary the rationing of shipping on a basis of priorities;    and for thispurpose international machinery for the allocation of available shipping against approved requirements and programmes was necessary.    These conditions no longer obtainto the same degree arid may be expected to disappear.    Thereis no reason to suppose that in the coming period the tonnageresources of the world both as regards dry cargo tonnage andtankers will be inadequate to meet the requirements of theworld although the world&apos;s tonnage resources are nowdistributed by flag very differently from 1939 and mostmaritime nations find themselves with less shipping than before the war as a result of war losses while others have greatly Increased their merchant fleets.2.      The aim should be to revive and allow to function themachinery by which shippers on the one hand and shipownerson the other (whether they be Governments or private owners)can obtain and supply shipping servicen as an ordinarytransaction involving the provision by the shipowner of the required services in return for reasonable remuneration.3.      The United Kingdom delegation- also   suggest that it isimportant, for governments to recognise the free movement ofshipping in the world&apos;s trades,  irrespective of flag,  asaii objective of policy.    The shortage of shipping during thewar and the exercise of control by Governments over theemployment of their national shipping for necessarypurposes has tended to obscure this essential feature of theworld1 s shipping business,, and in restoring more normalconditions Governments should aim to reinstate it.

h.      Thus Governments might well consider in shaping their shipping policy the implementation of principles such asthe following;-(i) Governments should aim to promote the processesby which shipping services available for international trade can be at the disposal ofshippers requiring them without discriminationon a basis of payment for the servicesre ndered.(ii)  Governments should refrain from discriminatoryaction,  under any guise or against shippingunder any flag which is likely to restrict the participation in the international tradesof tlu ir countries of ships under any flag-that are able to offer services on termsacceptable to shippers therein.B.    The position in the months immediately following 2nd March.5.      Although a lasting solution of shipping difficulties isin the view of the U.K.  Delegations to be found through the&apos;implementation of such principles as those outlined in thepreceding paragraph,   there are undoubtedly some abnormalfactors likely to persist in the months following 2nd March.The European nations are generally short of tonnage,   andsome of the European Maritime nations formerly supplyingships for international trading are not now, by reason ofwar losses,  physically able to make ships available for suchtrading,  or only on a limited scale.    This shortage oftonnage in the markets where it was normally offered would create wholly abnormal and unhealthy conditions in the freight market,  until the  shortage is rectified or thedemand-for tonnage is satisfied from elsewhere.    Again,shipments of bulk commodities for U.N.A. R. A.   and liberated countries are on an exceptionally large scale and may createspecial problems in some loading areas.    Finally,  until thesituation changes,  and shippers can reasonably rely uponnormal freight market for their requirements,  governments with responsibility for large shipments of food and supplies for their people are compelled to maintain control over their shipping.    On this account,   the United KingdomGovernment is retaining control by licence and directionover the employment of U.K.   shipping for a transitional period;    and oth r Governments have doubtless reachedsimilar decisions.    Some Governments also may continue forsome time to have merchant ships operating under theirownership and control.6.      During the U.. M.A.  period contracting Governments havebeen co-operating together in the discharge of the commonresponsibility for the supply to shipping for thepurposes set out in Article 1  of  the Agreement on principles.    It is suggested that any difficulties whichmay be&quot;expected to emerge in the  succeeding few months should be examined in the same spirit of co-operation.

/.      The United Kingdom Delegation suggest that thefollowing are necessary conditions of any acceptable solution for the transitional period:-(i) For a transitional period there should becontinued co-operation between contractingnations to the extent necessary to ensure thesupply of shipping for the rehabilitation ofnational economies,  and suitable machinery tofacilitate this co-operation.(ii) While effective to ensure the object of (i),the transitional arrangements should be framed so as not to retard the return to normal processes of international shipping-business.(iii) There should be opportunity during the transitional period for discussion of problems between co-operating nations sothat each nation may frame its own policies and decisions in the knowledge of the policies and actions of the others.    this could best be achieved, by constituting a consultative body,   say a United Maritime0 on sul t at i ve C ommi 11 e e.(iv) Transitional arrangements should operate fora limited and definite period.2nd February,  1cjl\
