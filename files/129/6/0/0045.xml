(46) 45.4th February, 1946.CABINET.BRABAZON I TYPE AIRCRAFT : PROPOSED EXTENSION OFFILTON (BRISTOL) AIRFIELD.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production.Summary.THE Brabazon I Aircraft (a large multi-engined civil aircraft designed fornon-stop operation between London and New York) is under construction bythe Bristol Aeroplane Company at Filton, and should fly in about fifteen months&apos;time. The runway will have to be extended and facilities provided for the finalassembly and flight testing of the aircraft. Work has been proceeding underthe limited authority given by the Cabinet in June last year. It has now becomeurgent to proceed with the full scheme since work must commence this Springif it is to be completed in time. In this paper I ask the Cabinet to approvemy taking steps immediately to buy the necessary land and to provide the facilities required at an estimated cost of  3,450,250.1. At their meeting on the 8th December, 1943, the War Cabinet took note of the fact that authority had been given for the design and construction oftwo prototypes of a large multi-engined civil land plane (the Brabazon I)conforming to requirements laid down by the Brabazon Committee(W.P. (43) 167th Conclusions, Minute 2). This aircraft is the largest of the types recommended by the Brabazon Committee. It has an &apos;&apos; all-up &apos;&apos; weightof about 130 tons, more than three times the &quot; all-up &quot; weight of any aircraft ofwhich there is any design or constructional experience in this country.2.   The aircraft, which has a still-air range of 5,000 miles, is designed for .non-stop operation between London and New York.   Its size and weight arenecessary because no smaller aircraft would be capable of competitive and economical operation on this route without recourse to refuelling in the air.There are good reasons for making this journey non-stop.(a) Not to enter this field would mean leaving it to the United States, whoare known to be building aircraft of comparable size, and would beas disastrous in its effects on our prestige as failure to build suitableliners for surface transport.(b) The non-stop run is the speediest way of crossing the Atlantic and alsothe most economic because an aircraft of this size will carry a largeload at little over half the rate per ton mile required by the nextBritish alternative.(c) It is also likely to be the safest way of crossing by air, since it reducesto the minimum the risks associated with taking-off and landing.Moreover, the eight engines greatly reduce the possibility of accidentby reason of engine failure.3.   An order for the two prototypes was placed with the Bristol aeroplane company, Limited, and in a Memorandum dated the 30th January, 1945(L.P. (45) 25), my predecessor informed the Lord Presidents Committee that[31264]
facilities would have to be provided at Bristol for the final assembly and flighttesting of these two prototypes; a hard runway 2,750 yards long and of abnormalwidth would be required, involving an extension of the Company&apos;s airfield atFilton. The total expenditure to be incurred before the two prototypes could be built and flown was estimated at  2,715,250, apart from the cost of the prototypesthemselves. The cost of the airframes was then expected to be  1,250,000 and ofthe engines  600,000, but it is now estimated that the airframes may cost 3 million and the engines  980,000, increasing the grand total to  6,695,250.At the time the original estimate was called for no detailed information was available and there was, therefore, no alternative but to assess the probable coston the basis of the available cost data of previous prototype aircraft, increasingthe elements proportionately to the weights. This basis has proved inadequatein that it dijd not provide for unorthodox features which have emerged indesigning and constructing an aircraft of this size.It should be noted that not all of the total expenditure should be attributed to the two prototypes, or even to the Brabazon I as a type, since (a) much of theexpenditure is essential if this country is to produce any aircraft of this size,and (b) some of the expenditure is in connection with developments in pressurisa-tion and ventilation which is an essential part of general aeronautical development.4. The first prototype is expected to be ready to fly in the second quarterof 1947, so that the runway should be available by then. If it is to be ready intime, work on it will have to be begun this Spring. The assembly shed must beprovided earlier, since a large amount of work on the erection of the prototypeswill be done in it; and if there is to be hope of achieving the programme, workon the assembly shed should proceed at once.5. The approximate area of land which it will be necessary to acquire forthe purpose of the scheme is 700 acres, of which the runway strip will requireabout 180 acres. The latter strip, consisting in the main of good average pasture,contains the village of Charlton with 36 houses, 8 farms, a public house, shopand Methodist Hall, together with 17 acres of common land. The remaining520 acres consists of farm land associated with the farm buildings which wouldhave to be demolished to enable the runway strip to be provided. The roads whichwould have to be closed include the Filton By-pass and a Class II road, togetherwith a number of other by-roads, Lanes and footpaths.6. The arguments for locating the flight shed and runway at Bristol maybe summarised as follows : If aircraft of this size are to be constructed, it willbe necessary to provide (a) a runway sufficiently long and wide to enable the pro-totypes-to be tested an operation which involves runways considerably larger than those suitable for the operation of already proved aircraft; and (b) an assembly shed with a clear span of approximately 300 ft. and a clear height ofapproximately 65 ft. in which to erect the aircraft. No such shed at presentexists in association with an airfield having a large enough runway. Further,the dimensions and -weight of the aircraft limit transport by road to compara-tively small parts, so that there must be on the airfield at which final assemblytakes place capacity not only for such final assembly, but also for a very large amount of sub-assembly. Construction with the speed which is so important ofprototypes of a size so considerably in excess of current practice also makes itnecessary that the design, drawing office and experimental resources of the con-instructors should be immediately available at the place of final assembly. Sincethe contract for the prototypes has been placed with the Bristol Aeroplane Co.Ltd., whose works are at Filton, it follows that the runway and assembly shedmust be provided .at Filton. These considerations were explained to representa-tives of the Air Ministry and the Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries,Health, Town and Country Planning, Production, War Transport, Works and civil Aviation, and of the Board of Trade at a meeting on the 13th February,1945, and this conclusion has been accepted by them all. Discussions have sincetaken place with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to determine the exact boundary of the area which it will be necessary to clear, in order to lessenso far as possible the dislocation to the neighbourhood which will be involvedin the scheme&apos;.7. At the request of the Cabinet further Memoranda were submittedby my predecessor on the 11th and 20th June (CP. (45) 25 and CP. (45) 39)and he was authorised to start work in connection with the construction of the
shed, subject to review in August, and to commitments incurred meanwhile notexceeding  50.000. It was, however, stipulated that, as soon as the detailed estimates for the building were available, they should be approved by theTreasury, having regard to the high cost of the building in terms both of money- 675,000-and of labour-500,000 man-hours&apos; work.The detailed estimates which have since been received show that the estimatedcost of the building has risen to  1,410,000, mainly due to increases in heightand area necessitated by alterations in the design of the aircraft following wind-tunnel tests and to increased costs of labour and materials. This increase,together with that referred to in paragraph 3 above, brings the grand total ofexpenditure involved to  7,430,250.    Details are given in the Appendix.8. It was not possible for me to make a further submission to the Cabinetin August, as was intended, because doubts arose on two points  (a) The aircraft, as originally designed, had an abnormally wide under-carriage, and doubts arose whether there existed in the UnitedStates runways sufficiently wide to enable the aircraft to operate there.This difficulty has now disappeared, since it has been found possibleto re-design the undercarriage with a narrower track which will causeno difficulty.(b) The B.O.A.C., who would operate the aircraft on the North Atlanticservice, expressed doubts whether the aircraft, powered with recipro-cating engines, would enable them to operate an efficient and competitive service. They are now, however, interested in the aircraft,powered with turbine-propeller engines.9. Two other issues were raised during the discussion of this project. Inthe first place, the suggestion was put forward by my predecessor, in his memorandum L.P. (45) 57, that it might be possible to enter into a tripartitearrangement between my Department, the Bristol Corporation and the bristol aeroplane Company, by which the enlarged Filton airfield would also be used asthe Municipal Airport for Bristol, but in view of the Governments decision toplace all transport airfields in this country under national ownership and controlthis suggestion has not been further pursued.10. The second subject which arose was the general problem of the provisionof particularly long runways for the construction of similar aircraft byother manufacturers. Members of the Cabinet suggested that it might be preferable to arrange for the construction of such aircraft at airfields wheresufficiently long runways already existed, rather than to construct suitable run-ways at manufacturers&apos; works. My predecessor submitted that this matter shouldbe deferred for consideration in connection with the general review of the country&apos;sneeds for airfields which was being undertaken by the Chiefs of Staff and theappropriate Ministries, by the direction of the late Prime Minister. It was,however, agreed that, to prevent the position being prejudiced meanwhile, a warning should be addressed to the manufacturers likely to be concerned withsuch aircraft, to the effect that they should not commit themselves to the use of factories or airfields which would not conform to the plan ultimately evolved asa result of the general review just mentioned.  Such a warning has been sent.11, My predecessor was advised that neither the Defence Acts nor the air navigation Act, 1936, could be used for the acquisition of the additional land required for the scheme, and he accordingly sought the authority of the lord president&apos;s Committee for the preparation of a Government &quot; hybrid &quot; Bill forits compulsory acquisition. The Committee considered these proposals at their meetings on the 2nd February and the 16th March, 1945 (L.P. (45) 6th Meeting,Minute 1, and L.P. (45) 15th Meeting, Minute 2), and reported favourably to theWar Cabinet in W.P. (45) 198 on the 3rd April, 1945.I have since been advised by the Treasury Solicitor, however, that I canexercise my powers under the Defence Acts, 1842 to 1935, and the HighwaysAct, 1835, to acquire without special legislation the land required for the brabazon I aircraft if I receive and accept a request from the Minister of CivilAviation to provide that aircraft for his purposes.12. It is now more than two years since the Brabazon I project was authorised by the War Cabinet. Design and prototype work are at an advanced stage andthe first aircraft should fly in about 15 months&apos; time. Considerable expenditure has been incurred and publicity has been given to the type, which is an essential
element in the aircraft development programme. The cost is high but is unavoidable-able if Great Britain is to advance into the field of big aircraft production, inwhich America is at present ahead of us. The extension of the airfield, and thecompletion of the erection shed on it, are necessary to the project and are nowurgent. I hope that the Cabinet will approve my taking immediately the stepsrequired to buy the land at Filton and carry out the necessary work at an estimated cost of  3,450,250.J.
