THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946. &apos; . - 7 JSECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 17.18th January, 1946.CABINET.REVISION OF THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY OF 1936.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues (Annex A), atranslation of a Note, received from the Egyptian Government on the20th December, which contains the anticipated demand for the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, and more particularly for the withdrawal ofBritish forces from Egypt in time of peace. I recommend that a reply agreeingin general terms to a review of our present arrangements should be sent, andattach a draft (Annex&apos; B) for concurrence.I should explain that the principles of those articles of the present treaty which are of the greatest importance from our point of view, viz., thoseestablishing the alliance and providing for very extended facilities to our forcesin time of war, are automatically renewable in any revision of the treaty.(Article 16 of the Treaty.) We should, of course, insist on this renewal as a pointof departure. The remaining articles deal with the military facilities affordedus by Egypt in time of peace, the Sudan, and various political questions of ageneral nature. A number of these articles (notably those relating to the Leagueof Nations) are in any event out of date and since the whole Treaty of 1936 isbased on the League of Nations and the Covenant, it cannot be contested that somerevision is necessary and is called for now.In addition, I am satisfied that it would be unwise, if not impossible, in thelight of the state of public opinion in Egypt and of the international situationin general to take our stand on the letter of the present Treaty which excludes thepossibility of revision before the end of this year. I contemplate that the new treaty (reproducing, as I-have said, the essential features of the old) should bebilateral in character, but should be drafted so as to fit into a regional defence system for the Middle East as a whole (such as I hope to bring about in due course). The Treaty would be related to the United Nations Organisation insome suitable form, possibly as an arrangement for &quot;collective defence&quot; suchas authorised by Article 51 of the Charter. I also agree with the advice of theChiefs of Staff that it is essential to press for facilities for the maintenance ofBritish land and air forces in Egypt in time of peace in order that the aid to begiven in emergency may be effective and sufficiently speedy.As regards the Sudan which, like the question of peacetime facilities for our troops, constitutes a major difficulty (and offers little scope for compromise),His Majesty&apos;s Governments have repeatedly refused to abandon their responsibility-ities towards the Sudanese peoples, amongst whom the idea of nationhood hasalready taken shape. It is out of the question for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accede to the request which will probably be made of them, viz., to recognise soleEgyptian sovereignty over the Sudanese. They must, I submit, maintain firmlythe standpoint that the future of the Sudan belongs neither to this country nor to Egypt, but to the Sudanese themselves, whose own wishes must -be taken inaccount in any new arrangements which may be devised. Our further tacticsmust depend on Egyptian reactions to this standpoint.As regards procedure, I am satisfied that we should follow the precedent of1936 and clear the ground by preliminary conversations in Cairo conducted byHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and by the Service Commanders acting as his13118   [311801 b
Exeellency&apos;s technical advisers. Apart from the practical inconvenience of receiving an Egyptian delegation in London during the coming weeks, the dis-cussions would be conducted in a glare of publicity, which in my view would greatly increase the likelihood of a breakdown.The general lines of the instructions which I would&quot; propose to issue toLord Killearn are annexed as Annex C. -E. B.Foreign Office, V&amp;th January, 1946.ANNEX A.Note of 20th December, 1945, from the Egyptian Government.&quot; The Egyptian Government, certain they are interpreting a unanimousnational sentiment, consider that the manifest interests of Anglo-Egyptian friend-ship and alliance demand that the two parties should revise, in the light of recent events and of their experience, the arrangements which govern their mutualrelations at the present time.2. It is certain that the Treaty of 1936 was concluded in the midst of aninternational crisis at a moment when the spectre of war was already appearing,and it is to these circumstances that it clearly owes its present form.3. Further, Egypt only accepted it under the pressure of necessity and asa testjnipny tp the loyalty and sincere desire for collaboration which inspire hertowards, her Ally.4. The Treaty thus appeared as a link in the chain of measures taken and-of agreements concluded to prevent the war which, was menacing the world,or to repel aggression if war could not be avoided,5-. If Egypt accepted the Treaty with all that it implied in the way of restrictions, on her independence, it was because she knew that they were of atransitory charapter and were destined to disappear at the same time as thecircumstances and events by reason of which they had been agreed to.6. In fact, the war has exhausted the principal objectives of the Treaty andopened the way for the adoption of a new system which would take the placeof arrangements established as much under the influence of a mistrust whichhad not yet entirely disappeared in 1936 as under the inspiration of militaryconditions which recent events have essentially modified.7&quot;. The international events which have upset the world, the Allied victory which has brought the last war to an end, the agreements destined to maintainthe peace and security pf the world, render several of the provisions of the Treatysuperfluous, and without justification.8. Moreover, it is not the letter of the text of agreements which decidestheir efficacity, but rather the goodwill of the peoples in consenting to them andthe spirit governing their application.9. Nothing proves better the loyalty with which Egypt honours her obliga-tions than her assistance to her Ally during the whole of the war, in the courseof which she gave the most concrete evidence of her fidelity to her alliances andof her sincerity in her friendships.10. The British Government, at the time of trial, obtained from their agreement with Egypt more than the text stipulated and much more than themost optimistic British negotiators had certainly been able to contemplate.11. Therefore, now that the circumstances which determined the particularcharacter of the Treaty of 1936 have changed, it has become necessary to reviseit in order to bring it into harmony with the new international situation; itsclauses which detract from the independence and the dignity of Egypt no longercorrespond tp present conditions.12. The presence of foreign forces on our soil in peace-time, even if stationed in distant areas, is still wounding to national dignity,,and can only be interpretedby Egyptian public opinion as the tangible sign of a mistrust which the BritishGovernment themselves, we believe, must regard as unjustified..
13. It would be better for the two countries that their relations should be founded on mutual understanding and confidence.14. Egypt, conscious of the needs imposed on her by the defence of her territory and of the responsibilities which her participation in the organisationof the United Nations entails for her, will, moreover, shrink from no sacrificein order, in the immediate future, to place her military potential in a stateenabling her to repel aggression pending the arrival of the reinforcements of her allies and of the United Nations.15. For this reason, and in view of the unanimous urge of the Egyptianpeople and their ardent desire to see their relations with Great Britain estab-lished on the basis of an alliance and a friendship which will no longer be inspired by past prejudices or out-of-date doctrines, the Egyptian Government express their confidence that these views will be shared by their Ally, and that the BritishGovernment will take steps to fix an early date for an Egyptian delegation toproceed to London to negotiate with them the revision of the Treaty of 1936.16. It goes without saying that the negotiations will include the question ofthe Sudan and will be inspired by the interests and aspirations of the Sudanese.ANNEX B.Draft reply to Egyptian Government.Your Excellency,I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the note of the 20th December,1945, by which the Egyptian Government request His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom to fix an early date for negotiations for the revision of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of the 26th August, 1936.His Majesty&apos;s Government have been well aware of the desire which has beenmanifested in Egypt for discussions with them on this subject, and if they havenot hitherto responded formally to these expressions of opinion by their Allies,the reason has lain first in the continuous pressure of events arising out of thetermination of hostilities, and, secondly, in the necessity of examining the pro-visions of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in the light of the Charter of the united nations and also of the lessons taught by those hostilities. And in this con-nexion His Majesty&apos;s Government, without wishing at the present stage toexamine in detail the contentions in the Egyptian Governments note, take leave to observe that one of these lessons was the essential soundness of the funda-mental principles on which the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 was based.It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to consolidate in a spirit offrankness and cordiality the close co-operation, achieved by Egypt and the BritishCommonwealth and Empire during the wrar, to wdiich Your Excellency&apos;s notebears testimony, and to place it on a footing of full and free partnership, asbetween equals in the defence of their mutual interests, and with full respect forthe independence and sovereignty of Egypt. Therefore, notwithstanding the pro-visions of Article 18 of the Treaty of 1936, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom declare themselves willing to undertake, wdth the Governmentof Egypt, a review of the treaty arrangements between them in the light of their mutual experience and with due regard to the provisions of the Charter of theUnited Nations for ensuring international peace and security. Instructionswill shortly be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo to hold preliminaryconversations with the Egyptian Government to that end. His Majesty&apos;&quot;sGovernment in the United Kingdom take note that the Egyptian government desire that the forthcoming discussions should include the question of the Sudan.ANNEX C.-Memorandum.I suggest below the lines on which the preliminary conversations with theEgyptian Government might be conducted. But first of all it is necessary to describe the relationship between the revised Treaty and the Charter of theUnited Nations.From the point of view of pure advantage, it would suit us best to representthe Treaty as an arrangement of collective security within the meaning, of[31180] &apos; &apos; b 2
Article 51 of the Charter rather than as a &quot;regional&quot; agreement within themeaning of Articles 52 to 54 because (a) It is not certain whether such a Treaty can qualify as a regional arrange-ment since, according to Article 52, one of the purposes of a regionalarrangement is the development of the pacific settlement of localdisputes through local agreements.(b) The Egyptian Government are known to be opposed to the idea that theTreaty constitutes a regional agreement.(c) Furthermore, there is an awkward provision in Article 53, viz., that noenforcement action is to be taken under a regional agreement withoutthe authorisation of the Security Council, whereas there is nolimitation on the exercise of collective defence in Article 51.On the other hand, from the broad standpoint of United Nations policy, itwould be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government openly and in terms to relate the revised Anglo-Egyptian Treaty to Article 51 of the Charter which, howeverreasonable in itself, is in effect in the nature of an &quot; escape clause&quot; and an admission that the international security system may not prove effective inpractice.In general, therefore, and certainly at the outset of the preliminary conver-sations, it wall be well to avoid reference to any specific security articles in the charter, though it is realised that in discussion at any rate we may be forced to doso before long. The object of the treaty can in fact be generally defined asstrengthening by mutual co-operation the contributions which each party willbe able to make to the maintenance of international peace and security inaccordance with the provisions of the United Aations Charter.1. Defence.It should be explained to the Egyptian Government that His Maiesty&apos;sGovernment are anxious to raise the question of the defence of Egypt from thelevel of a purely bilateral understanding by which Egypt, to judge from theEgyptian note, feels herself placed in an inferior position, to the level of ageneral partnership between the Middle East States and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for the safeguarding on the one hand of the integrity and independence of those States, and on the other of the security of the British Commonwealthwhich, as conclusively demonstrated in the course of two world wars, can bevitally threatened by an attack on the Middle Eastern area. In this matter theMiddle Eastern States and the Commonwealth stand or fall together. the suppression by an aggressor of the independence of the Middle Eastern states or of the independence of any one of them threatens to divide the Commonwealth.Similarly, any undermining by an aggressor of the British position in the middle east threatens the stability of the individual Arab countries. Ail the experienceof the last war, moreover, goes to show that smaller countries, however tenaciouslythey may defend themselves, must inevitably be overrun by an aggressor unless. they can receive full and immediate support from a Power possessing a militaryand economic potential comparable to that of the aggressor. If Egypt in thelast war was spared the rigours of enemy occupation it is due to the fact that under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty there was in Egypt the nucleus of a forcecapable of defending Egyptian territory and counter-attacking in its turn. Andit must be remembered that every aggressor from the dawn of history has extendedhis ambitions to the Middle Eastern area. No more fatal error could be made bythe Arab States than to suppose that their deliverance in 1941-43 has of itselfaverted the danger of attack for all time. The United Kingdom and their allies of the United Nations have pledged themselves to construct and to operate aninternational system for safeguarding world security, but until this edifice is completed regional partnership will be required, and the military advice at thedisposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government has convinced them that the defence ofthe Middle East can and should be organised on a collective basis.In the light of the foregoing considerations His Majesty&apos;s government regard it as essential that as is in fact provided by Article 16 of the treaty of1936-the Alliance shall continue in accordance with the principles contained ))in Articles 4-7 : and that in particular the aid promised by Egypt under Article 7in case of war or emergency should be confirmed and redefined in the light of experience. Once this point is conceded, it should be explained that, in order thatthis aid shall be fully effective, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it necessary
w have certain facilities in the Middle- East countries in time of peace; andjn particular they must be able to station in the area, and particularly in Egyptas one of the countries indicated by geography no less than by industrialdevelopment as regional bases, the minimum forces necessary to provide the nucleus of a war-time establishment for the defence of the area as a whole, andto ensure continuous collaboration in training and the use of technical devicesand armaments. Moreover, in the present state pf development of militaryaviation the burden pn a small State, or States, of maintaining the necessarydefensive forces tp ensure against long-range bombing attack (with all itsconsequences) would bj3 intolerable however great the national spirit pf sacrifice.His Majesty&apos;s Gpyernment will therefore ask the Egyptian Government first of all to reaffirm Articles 4-7 of the existing treaty and then to agree anprinciple to provide the Imperial forces with the necessary administrative, base and communications facilities, and to allow for a term of years the presence on her soil of those British forces considered necessary, as part of the contribution which Egypt is ready to make to the security of the Middle East.His Majesty&apos;s Government will also ask the Egyptian Government for permission to construct certain defences and to stage through Egypt such imperial forces as may be required. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, in addition, raisewith the Egyptian Government the question of the retention of the british military Mission.The details of these arrangements which must cover the three fightingservices and are necessarily of considerable complexity will require to be elaboratedin a military convention either to be annexed to, or to be concluded separately from, the main treaty of alliance, and it would, in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, be right that the States of the Arab League should be apprised ofthese arrangements (and of those which His Majesty&apos;s Government will set on foot in Palestine and may seek elsewhere in the area) with a view to their endorse-ment by the League and to the ultimate formation of a military confederacybetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the countries of the Middle Eastembracing as wide an area as is required. The proposals which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will lay before the Egyptian Government for this purpose have been so drawn up as to fit into an overall defence scheme for the Middle East area.?. Political Articles.His Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to discuss with the Egyptian Govern-ment the modification or, as the case may be, suppression of those Articles of the1936 Treaty which the passage of time and developments in the international fieldhave rendered out of date, viz., Articles 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 13, 15, 16 and 17.3. The Sudan.His Majesty&apos;s Government take note that the Egyptian Government, in dis-cussing the future of the Sudan, will base themselves pn the interests and theaspirations of the Sudanese. The standpoint of His Majesty&apos;s Government issimilar, and they need only refer in this connexion to the Charter of the United-Nations which defines the trusteeship system (to which the present administrationof the Sudan offers some analogy) as designed to promote the political, economic,social and educational advancement of the inhabitants . . . and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to. the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.The safety of Egypt&apos;s southern frontier is a joint Anglo-Egyptian interest at is also free access to the trade and commerce of the Sudan. Apart from thisHis Majesty&apos;s Government have no objectives in the Sudan save the continuedwelfare of the inhabitants and the safeguarding and continuity, so long as it is needed, of the great task of administration which has been performed for almosthalf a century by a number of His Majesty&apos;s subjects. Political progress has been rapid in the Sudan in recent years, and it has been necessary to devise con-stitutional machinery to enable native opinion to be consulted. As the egyptian government are aware, the Governor-General, at the last meeting on the8th November of the Advisory Council for the Northern Sudan, declared that :I &apos;&apos; Should the question of the future status of the Sudan be raised by the Con-Vminium Powers in any revision of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, it would be theintention of the Sudan Government that the Advisory Council for the NorthernSudan should be consulted in order that its views should be at the disposal of^e Sudan Government for transmission to the Powers.   It is the opinion of the
Sudan Government that the views of the Sudanese people should be obtained through constitutional channels in a matter of such vital importance to their future well-being.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, therefore, that any discussion of the modification of Article 11 of the 1936 Treaty should be postponed until the sudanese people have been consulted and have made known their own wishesThe procedure by which this consultation can best take place is being examined by the Governor-General, who will be available to discuss it with the egyptian government if required. But His Majesty&apos;s Government again wish to emphasise that tlhe facts of the situation and modern international doctrine render academic,in their opinion, any prior discussion of the vexed question of sovereignty overthe Sudan.
