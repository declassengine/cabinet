-    141(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. w.secret.P.(U6)  2k22j.TH JANUARY.  19U6CABINETLAND POLICY IN REGARD TO SURPLUS RUNWAYED AIRFIELDSMemorandum &quot;by the Home secretary the Airfields Committee have considered thepolicy to be adopted in regard to the runwayed airfieldsheld under requisition which will not be required in thefuture for flying.    We recommend that, subject to a few exceptions,  the land should &quot;be acquired by the State since,in our view, this represents the only means by which thebest practical use can be made of it, having regard to theextent to which it has been spoilt.2.       The considerations involved are as follows:-(a) On a runwayed airfield there are about90,000 cubic yards of concrete and asimilar amount of hardcore underneaththe concrete.    Restoration of the land would involve breaking this up,removing it from the site and reimportingthe topsoil.(b) Nearly all airfields consist of landtaken from numerous tenancies and^ ownerships;    access roads have beenobliterated, and hedges and ditchesremoved;    farmhouses and buildings have been demolished;    and theagricultural drainage of the areas has been largely destroyed.(c) Under the Compensation (Defence) Act,1939, a land-owner is entitled to claimcompensation for damage done to hisland up to the maximum value of the land at the time of requisition.    The costof removing the concrete alone would beat least  50/60,000 and would in allcases exceed the value of the land,which averages  30,000 an airfield.This does not include the cost of removing the hardcore filling underthe concrete,  and of reimportingtopsoil, restoring drainage etc.    Thus,if the land were derequisitioned and compensation paid,  the owner would receivethe full value of his land in cash andthe return of the land itself.-1-

But the. compensation payment would not   .       142. enable him, even if labour and plantwere available, to tear up the runwaysand restore the land to anything likeits original state, unless it v/eredecided to apply the provisions ofSection 52 of the Requisitioned land and War Works Act, which enables aMinistry to defray the cost of the rehabilitation of ^ ho land.3.     The Coivmaittee take the view that :&apos; t would not be in thenational interest to spend labour and money in the removalof runways, etc., and have been advised by the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister if Agriculture andFisheries that:-(i)    where a runwayod airfield has been constructedon land requisitioned from numerous ownershipsand tenancies, it would be impracticable forthe individual owners and tenants, if left totheir own devices, even .f additional compensastion were paid by the State, to make adequate arrangements for the best use ofthe land for agriculture,    and(ii)   with the concrete remaining, even though some measure of rehabilitate on were undertaken by the State, the best usecould not be made of the land if itwere derequisitioned into its originalownerships and tenancies.We consider accordingly that where runvayed airfieldssurplus to flying requirements have been constructed on landcomprising multiple ownerships and tenancies, the land should,as a rule, be acquired by the State, and managed foiagricultural purposes as a single entity by the agricultural departments.     While leaving the concrete work, partialrehabilitation would be carried out to refit the areas betweenthe runways for agricultural use.ii.     Purchase of the airfields would be effected underSection 6(1) of the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act, 191+5;which gives a Minister power to acquire land if he considers thatit is desirable in the public interest that the land should bedealt with in a particular manner with a view to the total or partial rehabilitation thereof and the land is only Likely tobe dealt with in that manner if it is sc acquired,.5.     The -procedure of reference to the War Works commission would be effected by the Air Ministry, who would publish thecase for acquisition as stated by the Agricultural Departments.It would be made plain that the acquisition was not proposed on defence grounds.      Objectors would, have an opportunity of putting forward their vic/s to the Conmrission.6.     The individual circumstances at each airfield would beconsidered before a decision is taken to purchase.Executions would be made in certain cases, for example,(i) where an airfield has been taken from only ore or perhapstwo ownerships, so that there will not necessarily be any

reason why the best use of the land could not bo madeby the previous owners, if it were returned to them;    and(ii)    where the land is near a town and it is agreedthat it may be used for building or industrialdevelopment.7.     The number of runwayed airfields not required for flying is not yet settled but may be in the neighbourhoodof 100.     There is a defence requirement that in generalthe airfield surface and flying approaches should be keptfree from building development which could not readily beremoved in the event of a future-emergency, andarrangements for this will be made under planning powersexercised by the Ministry of Town and Country Planning.This does not affect the policy outlined above.8.     Lord Meston has a Motion down for debate in the Housoof Lords on 29th January asking the Government &quot;to clarifythe position relating to the payment of compensation inthe case of agricultural land which was requisitioned and used for aerodromes -and then subsequently derequisitioned.&quot;The Lord Chancellor has undertaken to reply on behalf ofthe Government.     The Airfields Committee recommend for theapproval of the Cabinet that the policy set out above should form the basis of his statement.(Intld.)
