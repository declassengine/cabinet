if,/vis&quot; ***vfDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),   ggSEC RET.P.u6) lk.COPY NO15TH JANUARY,  19k6CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME - LIMITATION&apos;    OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of National InsuranceA,t their meeting on 13th December (C .M. (h5) 62ndConclusions, Minute 2)  the Cabinet agreed that the national insurance Bill should provide for a limit of 30 weeks on thepayment of unemployment benefit, with extensions forcontributors with good employment records, and invited theSocial Services Committee to consider what changes might bemade in the conditions for the receipt of assistance byunemployed persons who had exhausted uheir title to benefit,with a view to the preparation of a statement which might he made by me when the Bill was before Parliament,2.      After consultation with the Assistance Board I have cometo the conclusion that it would he difficult to make any effectivechange in the conditions for the payment    of assistance whichwould not virtually abolish the existing needs test-.    I have therefore been driven to seek a solution along the lines of av :mporary modification of the &quot;benefit   conditions rather than ofan adjustment in the conditions for the receipt of assistance.3.     As the National Insurance Bill stands, benefit willbe payable rut merely for 30 weeks, but for a substantial additional spell &quot;based on the applicant&apos;s record of contributionsover a recent period.    Thus, a claimant with a good record may receive benefit for a total period substantially in excess ofa year.k.      I fear, however,, that this provision may not be adequate tomeet the situation as it is likely to develop in the next year ortwo,.   There are already considerable pockets of unemployment inthose areas - e.g. South Wales,  the Industrial Belt of Scotlandand North East England - which suffered most from long-termunemployment in the years between the wars, and it is clear tL.u,however actively a policy of full employment may he pursued, therewill be an interim period, before the measures taken by theGovernment oome into  full effect, during which considerable numbers of workers, unemployed through no fault of their own.,will exhaust their title to unemployment benefit   under the.Bill as it stands.    A trend in this direction is already evidentfrom the experience of the Assistance Board., .

5.      To moot this situation I should propose to treat the period of,  say, two years from the passing of theNational Insurance Bill as an emergency period,  and totake power to give to all contributors insured forunemployment special credits which would entitle them too further spell of benefit in that period up to a maximum of26 weeks. -6.      I have discussed my proposal with the Social services committee    and, with the exception of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, they are, I think,  convinced that there isno alternative to it.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer isnot satisfied that any such provision is necessary andwould prefer to wait and see what the extent of the pressure is in Parliament before considering whether any concession should be made.      I feel, however, that unless -some provision on these lines, to tide us over the difficult period for the next year or two,.can be inserted in the Bill before it is introduced, the whole-questionof the limitation of imemploymeht benefit will become amatter of bitter controversy and we may well &quot;bu faced with,a difficult situation when the Bill is before Parliament.J^G,Ministry of National Insurance.,3.7.1.15th January, 19h7.
