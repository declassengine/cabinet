THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. CoPy WaCP. (46) 32.30 A January, 1946.CABINET.ECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1946.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.FOLLOWING instructions by the Prime Minister an Official Committeewas set up in September to collate the advice to be given to Ministers on the best use to be made of the nation&apos;s economic resources. ^2. This Committee maintains close contact, through a number of Working-Parties, with all Departments interested in the use of our economic resources andthe Survey for 1946 is based on-a-conspectus of the Departmental Programmes.A copy of the Survey and of the Sterling Committee&apos;s covering memorandum are attached (Annex).  They are well worth study by all of my colleagues.3. By direction of the Prime Minister the following Ministers are toexercise constant supervision over this work of central economic planning : Lord President of the Council,Chancellor of the Exchequer,President of the Board of Trade,Minister of Labour and National Service,and the attached documents have been submitted to them in this capacity.4. The Economic Survey for 1946 is necessarily on an experimental basis.It indicates broadly the claims made on the national resources by deparmental programmes and tne extent to which these exceed the resources estimated to beavailable for the year as a whole. The present survey deals, however, only with1946 and cannot therefore form the basis for a long-term economic plan outlining the shape which the economy should take after the present transitional period.Such a plan cannot be prepared until the Survey has been projected further intothe future and, in the light of such an extended Survey, Ministers have reachedthe necessary decisions about the future use of resources. We have already given instructions for the Economic Survey for 1946 to be broken down as far aspossible into separate quarters or half-years and to be projected into 1947. Wehave also arranged for consideration of the economic problems which will arise in making a survey for a post-transition year, say 1950. In the meantime thepresent survey provides a basis for Ministerial decisions to bring claims in 1946into reasonable relationship with the available resources.5. On the basis of the policies and programmes taken into account in the survey for 1946, there will be a man-power shortage of 1-3 million at the endof 1946, while for the year 1946 as a whole, Departmental demands exceed theavailable National Income by nearly  500 million.6.   We agree with the opinion expressed by the Official Committee that&quot; the outstanding fact which emerges from the Survey is that we cannot both[31071] o
maintain the whole defence machine on the scale at present envisaged, and simul-taneously reconvert our industry to peace production at the requisite speed.&apos; The. man-power gap is already under consideration by the Man-power Committeeand the Defence Committee. We strongly support the suggestion that the man-power employed in the Services and their Supply should be reduced from 2-6 to1-85 million for the end of 1946; and we recommend that releases should be madeat as early a date as possible, since the earlier in the year that men can be released,the greater will be the effect.in closing the gap during 1946.7. But there is necessarily a time lag between their release and any consequential increase in civilian&apos;supplies, and in any case an extensive reductionof this magnitude in the Defence sector of the economy cannot be brought aboutimmediately. For these reasons some supplementary action to help to close the gap during- 1946 must be sought.8. The outcome of the Washington Loan discussions has done nothing to diminish our basic need for expanded exports; and it is clearly undesirable toreduce the export programme. After six years of war, we should avoid if possiblethe need to hold civilian consumption at a lower level than that on which the survey for 1946 based its forecasts. Moreover, the task of saving even the 1,540 million already required by the present plan is formidable. A solution which involved a further restriction in the supply of goods and services forconsumption would still further increase the inflationary pressure and wouldrequire us to push savings still higher.9. This points to the need to keep a very careful scrutiny of investment projects, both public and private, during 1946. Some projects must go forward.In particular, industrial re-equipment which will make a substantial and earlycontribution to export production should be undertaken; and it would be wastefulto hold back capital development in regions in which there will in any case be apool of available unemployed labour. There are other industries where improve-ments of capital equipment are so urgent that they should not be postponed. Inother cases, however, where a delay of some months in the inception of a capitalproject would not prove fatal, there is a very strong case for postponement.10. Another field in which there may be a relative waste of resources in 1946is in the distributive trades. The difficulty is to see how labour can be induced to go into other occupations in the absence of extensive labour controls and withthe existing rights of reinstatement. The Cabinet has already decided thatreliance cannot be placed upon extensive labour controls to divert men and women to the occupations in which they are most wanted. Alternative policies are toexplain to labour the importance of these occupations and to do all that ispossible to ensure that the attractiveness of the occupations, from the point of viewof conditions of work and also of relative rates of pay, is such as to induce labour to enter them. These and other possible means of deflecting man-power fromdistribution are now under review at the official level.11. We have considered the question of publicity. We feel that at themoment any public announcement suggesting the existence of a cut-and-dried plan for 1946 would give rise to a clamour for the disclosure of facts and figures anda description of the planning machinery, which would cause serious embarrass-ment to the Government in the present, preliminary and experimental stage. Weconsider therefore that great care should be taken to avoid any references whichmight suggest to the public that any cut-and-dried plan exists or can be expectedduring the next few months of transition. Some statement must, however, bemade on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government indicating in broad terms thenature of the economic problems which the nation has to overcome in 1946. Wesuggest this should take the form of a statement indicating that the Governmentis adapting to post-war needs the experience gathered in the war in the allocation of resources, with a view- to ensuring that so far as the means at our disposalpermit, essential needs are not sacrificed to the less essential. The statement could go on to compare 1946 with 1945, emphasising that 1946 will be a year of continued shortages of man-power and of supplies and bringing out asconcretely as possible the implications of full employment. This statement would attempt to outline the main economic conditions which are expected to characterise1946. We propose that this statement should be made in Parliament early inFebruary and that it should form the basis of more widespread publicityI explaining the need for higher productivity and for the largest possible numberI of workers to remain in industry.
12.   We accordingly ask the Cabinet (a) to take note that action is being taken by the Defence and Man-powerCommittees towards closing the end-year man-power gap of1-3 million;(b) to take note that even if the proposed reductions in man-power for theServices and their supplies by the end of 1946 suffice to close the end-year gap, they will not in any case close the indicated gap during theyear as a whole, and that supplementary measures for this purpose will therefore be necessary in particular measures to postpone less essential investment;(c) to take note of the need for publicity as a means of securing the extraeffort required to close the gap (subject to avoiding any publicsuggestion that a cut-and-dried plan is being proposed) and toauthorise preparation of a statement for submission to the Cabinet onthe lines of paragraph 11 above;(d) subject to (a) and (b) above, to approve the Economic Survey and covering^memoranda, as a basis on which Departments may proceed with theallocation of National resources in 1946.H.

ECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1948.Note by the Chairman of the Official Steering Committeeon Economic Development.I submit for consideration by the Lord Presidents Industrial Sub-Com-mittee the Economic Survey for 1948. The Survey has been prepared under thegeneral guidance of the Official Committee, who submit the following-comments :    .The general picture.1. Although the Survey is expressed in quantitative terms, it makes no claimto mathematical accuracy as regards either the component items or the finalresults. It is based on the working policies and programmes of the departments for 1946. These represent, not the true potential demand, but what departments have thought it reasonable to ask for, given the practical limitations of the presentsituation. The departmental programmes have thus already been pruned to exclude all but the main priorities.2. On the basis of programmes thus pruned the broad result of the Surveyis that at the end of 1946 there will still be a man-power shortage of over1-3 million, while for the year 1946 as a whole Departmental demands at presentexceed the National Income by nearly  500 million.3. Although the Survey is mostly expressed in terms of the year 1946 as awhole, the pattern will be changing rapidly throughout the year. In deciding what adjustments should be made to bring our economy into balance timing willbe all-important. Every man turned over from war to peace in the first quarterof 1946 will contribute as much towards bridging the gap in this year as two orthree men turned over in October.*The release of man-power.4. In our view, the outstanding fact which emerges from the Survey is thatwe cannot both maintain the whole defence machine on the scale at presentenvisaged, and simultaneously reconvert our industry to peace production at the requisite speed. If the latter object is to be achieved, the reduction in the man-power of the Services and their supplying industries by the end of 1948 must be far greater than is now proposed, and must be carried out far more rapidly than is contemplated in present plans. These plans, which are still under review,envisage a man-power force of 2-6 million in the Services and their supplyingindustries at December 1946, as compared with 1-75 million in June 1939 a figure which was already considerably above the normal pre-war level. If a cut of a million could be made in the figure for December 1946, this would go a long-way to bridge the estimated total man-power gap of about 1-3 million. Even a cut of only 600,000 would go a long way to bring what we are attempting withinthe limits of our resources, especially if the cut is made early in the year. More-over, our exchange position makes it imperative that we should cut down our overseas military expenditure as rapidly and as drastically as possible.The balance of payments.5. Since the Survey was prepared the Washington Loan negotiations havebeen concluded. This has in no way removed our basic need to speed-up the pace of our export production. Our aim must be to establish a sufficient flow of exportsduring 1946 to maintain confidence in sterling as a title to goods so as to enable us to face the obligation of early convertibility. It follows that, wherever elsecuts or postponements may fall, it must not be on exports. On the contrary,whatever reinforcement of the man-power force can be obtained by speeding updemobilisation must be steered, so far as is humanly possible, into exportproduction.Personal consumption and saving.6. In view of the exhaustion of the nation after six years of deprivationthere must be some amelioration in the present standard of living if we are to[31071] b
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10 th January, 1946.obtain the necessary effort during the year. The foreigner must not be the onlyone to benefit from our increasing production. The Survey does, in fact, envisageprogressive improvement above the present level of home consumption, but thestandard throughout 1946 is bound to be still below the pre-war level. This ata time of high incomes, an abnormal back-log of demand and a large mass ofaccumulated savings means that the Savings Campaign must be continued at full strength throughout the year. If we are to prevent an inflationary increase in personal expenditure, a total of  1,540 million of net savings is necessary. Thisis little less than the  1,809 million of 1944 and, allowing for price changes, some three times the net savings of  361 million in 1938.Measures to make best use of the civilian labour force.7. Besides accelerating the rate of release from the Forces, every means ofstretching the existing civilian labour force must be employed. The fullest use&apos;should be made of immobile unemployed labour, particularly in the development areas. If it is decided that the level of activity in certain industries or services is to be scaled down, it is important to make sure that the cuts fall on areas inwhich there really is a man-power shortage and not on those in which unemploy-ment is already showing itself. A further reinforcement of the labour force couldbe obtained if women could be persuaded to stay on in industry instead of returning to their homes and employers made to recognise that it is in their own interests to retain them if they are to avoid a grave labour shortage later in the year. Wesuggest that Ministers should consider making a special appeal to industry earlyin the New Year as part of a general statement to the nation about the situation of the country in the light of the Loan Agreement. This appeal might be coupled with a statement that the demobilisation target of 1^ million by the end of 1945has been achieved and an announcement that the rate of release in the future willbe still further speeded up.Private capital investment.8. Much discrimination will be necessary in any restrictions placed on private capital investment. Though it may be true that this is a class of demand in which,taken as a whole, the rate of increase can be slowed down for, say, a year withoutdoing lasting damage, yet the re-equipment of our industries is vital if we areto regain our competitive position in world markets. Our general aim must,therefore, be to concentrate industrial re-equipment in 1946 on projects which willmake a substantial and early contribution to export production.Future procedure.9. The present Survey is a first effort. Its form is experimental and willbe improved and developed with experience. In particular, it will be broken down as far as possible by quarters for 1946 and preliminary surveys will bedrawn up for future years. The quarterly information for 1946 will bring out more clearly than has been possible in the present report the pace at which the pattern is changing during the year, and will enable more precision to be givento the decisions about timing, to which reference has been made above. Thesurveys for future years will make it possible to look more carefully at the patterntowards which we are moving and to keep this in mind in making the necessary adjustments in the year 1946. Both the quarterly information for 1946 and thesurveys for future years will be kept continuously under review in the light of reports of actual results. This will enable progress reports to be made so that ministers can see how things have actually turned out and how far the plans madehave been achieved.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES, Chairman,on behalf of the Committee.

The three tables in Section II below together indicate in summary thesupplies of resources estimated to be available for disposal in 1946, the main categories of claims put forward against these resources, and the balance betweensupply and demand thereby exhibited.2. Resources available at home, and the claims upon them, are illustrated inTable A, which shows man-power supplies and requirements. These man-power resources, in combination with land and capital equipment, provide the nation&apos;shome-produced output.3. The total volume of resources available to meet home demands will be augmented by borrowing from abroad. The effect of such borrowing on our overseas trade position is illustrated by Table B, which shows the balance on current account of our foreign payments and receipts.4. Table C sums up the situation in terms of national income and expendi-ture. The figures of net national income show the total of incomes which wouldbe generated if we succeed, on the one hand, in maintaining a high level of employ-ment and, on the other hand, in avoiding an inflationary rise of prices and wage-rates. Their sum is thus equal to the value of total resources available withouteither running down capital at home or incurring deht obligations abroad.Allowance is made for borrowing from abroad as a means of augmenting resources available for domestic use by deducting such borrowing from the domestic demands[31071] ^ b
for resources shown on the national expenditure side of the national account inTable C. The other items on the expenditure side of the account all show com-competing domestic claims for resources arising from the various broad categories of demand.5. All three tables show deficits or gaps. The deficit shown on the balanceof payments (Table B) is a &quot; real &quot; deficit in the sense that a deficit of somesize will actually materialise; that is to say, we shall, in 1946, inevitably purchasemore from abroad than we can finance by our sales to overseas markets. any increase in the deficit on our balance of payments would reduce the pressure onour domestic resources (as indicated in Tables A and C), in so far as it wouldmean either that we were devoting less of our scarce resources to exports or were importing larger supplies from abroad. But there are two overrulinglimitations on our overseas deficit. First, there is the absolute limitation set by what other countries can be persuaded to supply without current payment.Secondly, there is the financial limitation imposed by prudence : that importsmust be restricted to avoid piling up heavy debt obligations against the future,and that exports must be expanded in order that we may establish ourselves inforeign markets against the early day when we must once again balance our overseas accounts.6. The gaps shown in Tables A and C are purely &quot; notional.&quot; In the event,we cannot employ more labour than is available for employment or spend more on goods and services than the value of the goods and services which are actuallyavailable on the market for purchase. The deficits here merely show that, on thebasis of current programmes and policies the demands for resources are in excessof the available supplies, and that (except in so far as domestic or imported supplies can be increased) not all the programmes can be met in their entirety.Either there must be a planned scaling down of requirements or else the limitationof demands to the level of total supplies must be left to chance, with the risk that supplies of high priority fall belqw schedule.ii8. This Section contains the three summary Tables A, B and C, outlining the man-power position, the balance of payments and the national income andexpenditure for 1946. The outstanding features of these Tables and the mainoutlines of the departmental programmes and policies which they represent are discussed in Section III, while notes and more detailed statistics are contained inthe appendices. These programmes and policies may be briefly summarised asfollows : (i) The strength of the Services to be 1,750,000 at the end of 1946, comparedwith 3,843,000 at the end of 1945 and 477,000 at June 1939.(ii) Industrial employment to supply the Services to be 850,000 at the end of1946, compared with a programme of 1,450,000 at the end of 1945(&apos;)and 1,270,000 at June 1939.(iii) The volume of exports at the end of 1946 to be a little greater than therate for 1938 and increasing.(iv) Food consumption to be 90 per cent, and purchases of clothing to be nearly 65 per cent, of the 1938 amounts as the average for the year.(v) Total gross investment, including the making good of war damage andarrears of depreciation, to be about 5-10 per cent, greater than the 1938volume.(vi) Employment in building and civil engineering at the end of 1946 to be alittle higher than at June 1939.This is a formidable list of targets to maintain stronger defence forces; tore-establish the pre-war level of exports; to reach a higher level of employment in building than during 1939; to regain the pre-war level of gross investment; and tomake substantial progress towards our normal standard of life. If we couldattain them all we could surely count ourselves fortunate.8. The implications of the tables for the work of planning the country&apos;economic development are discussed in Section IV.(l) At the end of October 1945, industrial employment to supply the Services had fallen to2,511,000, leaving a reduction of 1,061,000 to be effected during the following two months.

9. The total working population is expected to fall substantially in 1946due to the abnormal wastage of women from industry, and to be only 50,000above the &quot;July 1939 level by the end of the year. But, because of the lower levelof unemployment assumed for 1946, the working population of insured ages, whichis more important for the size of the national income, is estimated to be 720,000higher than in 1939.10. The requirements set against resources in the three tables of Section IIare the claims put forward by the responsible departments in the knowledge of theneed for economy. They represent not the total demand for goods and services which would be expected in a free market at prices and incomes assumed to beruling in 1946, but the requirements which departments regard as the mostimportant and are willing to sponsor. In general, man-power requirements arethe minimum demands necessary to attain the target level of supplies, and make no allowance for particular shortages and bottlenecks in production.11. A difficulty in preparing Table C has been to ensure that priceassumptions on the expenditure side are consistent with estimates of costs on theincome side, so that the gap measures a real deficiency of resources. We believethat any bias is in the direction of understating the gap.A rmed Forces and other government claims12. Man-power requirements for the Services and their stores in Table A,overseas war expenditure in Table B, and defence expenditure included ingovernment expenditure in Table C are all provisional, dependent upon the review of strategic commitments by the Chiefs of Staff and upon the effect of therecent Defence Committee ruling that the Services, as far as possible, make useof existing stocks. At present, man-power demands for the Services and theirstores, though falling throughout 1946, are 850,000 higher at the end of the year than in 1939. Requirements for national and local government industrial and non-industrial staffs are 440,000 higher. If fully met at this level, these tworequirements would more than counterbalance the lower level of unemployment and the increase in the working population compared with pre-war; and labour for export and home civil work, though increasing, would still be less at theend of the year than in 1939.Personal expenditure on consumption13. On the basis of requirements, personal consumption per head wouldaverage for the whole year about 93 per cent, of the 1938 level, compared with85 per cent, in 1944. Since 1938, however, large increases have occurred in expenditure on beer, tobacco and travel, so that in 1946 consumption of other items would be significantly less than 93 per cent, of the 1938 level. Detailedforecasts on the basis of requirements are shown in Tables 5 and 6 of appendix IV. Food consumption would be slightly above the level of 1944, due mainly to the more plentiful provision of fruit, fish and some processed foods.In real terms, purchases of furniture and furnishings would average about 45 percent., and of clothing about 65 per cent, of the 1938 volume. Man-power require-ments given for home civil work in the Group III industries, even at the end of1946, are about 7 per cent, less than the labour employed in 1939.14. The total man-power requirements for distribution and other servicesrepresent not departmental requirements but the minimum strengths which theMinistry of Labour consider it prudent to assume. If these industries build their strength up more nearly to the 1939 levels, the man-power gap will be corres-correspondingly increased. Increased man-power in distribution does not, of course,increase the supply of such rationed goods as food, clothing and furniture forwhich there is such need, but it will provide benefit to consumers in the form ofeasier shopping conditions, improved delivery services, and the like.Domestic investment15. Requirements for home civil work in the Group I industries claim by december 1946 a labour force 50 per cent, above the level of 1939, and requirements for the building and civil engineering industry at December 1946 are a littlehigher than for 1939.   For building and civil engineering, demands have been
drawn up on a different basis from other requirements. The man-power figures are those which have been agreed between the Ministry of Labour and the Ministryof Works as the departments with responsibility over the entire field. Until thebuilding requirements of the departments concerned are collected, it cannot be known how the provision made here will compare with claims from all sources.16. The size of both these claims on man-power is largely explained by the increases in expenditure on public and private investment shown in Table C,although a substantial part of the Group I industries are engaged in the pro-duction of consumers&apos; goods, e.g., electrical equipment. Government net fixed investment is largely in permanent and temporary houses, which account for about 270 million out of a total of  345 million, on the assumption that about two outof three permanent houses will be built for local authorities. Of the remaining 75 million of net investment, about  10 million is attributable to the provisionof factories for the important purpose of diversifying industrial activity in theDevelopment Areas. The demand for private net fixed capital formation isestimated at  710 million, of which about one-third represents war damage repairs and new building work, including private houses. In real terms, the total grossinvestment planned for 1946 is only 5-10 per cent, higher than actual gross invest-ment in 1938, despite the fact that there exists at the present time a large volumeof arrears of depreciation and war damage which will have to be made good.Work in progress.17. Two large items of national expenditure shown in the table  550 million on increases in stocks and work-in-progress, and  150 million on exports for which payment will not have been received from the foreign pur-chasers by the end of 1946 are an inevitable concomitant of filling up the pipe-line of the peacetime economy. Together they amount to about as much as thetotal of private net investment to which reference is made above. This is a very heavy but inescapable drain on the country&apos;s resources as the peacetime economy is being restored, and compares with a similar activity in the munitions industries which absorbed so much of the country&apos;s effort in the early years of the war. &quot; Houses under construction &quot; are also of this character, but it has not beenpossible to distinguish these from &quot; houses completed &quot; and both categories areincluded in government and private fixed investment.The balance of payments18. Import requirements have been limited by the shortages of supplies and the tightness of our exchange position. The figure for overseas war expendi-ture turns upon the extent of our military responsibilities overseas.19. The more important of the plans on which the balance of paymentslias been drawn up are summarised in the following table : 1938 1944 1946Labour engaged on direct export work(&apos;)Thousands      .........      1,200 284 1,285     &apos;Volume of exportsIndex.   ............        100 30 75Value of recorded exports(2)  million        .........        471 258 700Payments for exports(2)  million        ...      ,.....        477 243 550Value of retained imports million .........        739 968(3)      1,000(J) The figures are for mid-year and include direct coal exports. For 1938 the figure isapproximate.(2) Excluding re-exports, and excluding munitions exported in 1944; valued f.o.b.(3) Including Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid supplies of food, drink, tobacco and raw materials.Labour in direct export work at the end of 1946 is planned to be 35 per cent,above pre-war, but over the year as a whole the numbers concerned are to averageonly about 10 per cent, above 1938. As production takes time, the volume of exports, though likewise increasing, will show a proportionately smallerexpansion. At the end of 194.6, the rate will be just a little above the rate in1938, but the average for the year will be only 75 per cent, of the pre-war level.
Because prices have increased, the value of exports and the payments for them will have risen proportionately much more than the volume as will be so in thecase of imports but payments will rise more slowly than the value of deliveriesbecause of the lag between recorded export and payment.IV20. The-three tables of Section II show that, despite the assumption of adangerously large adverse balance there is a gap between requirements and supplies of some 6 per cent. Moreover, this is in spite of a progressive improve-ment throughout the year in the aggregate of domestic supplies available for otherthan war purposes, and in spite of the modest size of some requirements as setdown in the tables.21. The Survey thus presents two main planning problems. First, if atall possible, supplies must be increased. Secondly, to the extent that this is notpossible, requirements must be further pruned. In these ways, programmedexpenditure can be brought into line with target national income and theconsistency of programmes and policies established which is essential to a national plan.22. In considering how best this planning may be done, however, there area number of points of a general nature which provide an essential background toany current planning decisions, and which require prior comment.The Background to Planning(a) The threat of inflation23. Table C shows that, on present programmes for 1946, there is an excessof  470 million in planned expenditure over the target. If, in fact, those responsible for investment attempt successfully to spend more on capital develop-ment than the amount allowed for under present departmental programmes, the gap will be so much the larger than this sum. As the expenditure allowed on private investment in these programmes is very little higher than pre-war, it willprobably be substantially less than business firms would wish to undertake.24. Similarly, the gap shown in Table C wall be so much larger than 470 million if private consumers in fact spend more than the  6,100 millionallowed. This sum permits of a level of personal consumption only 93 per cent,of pre-war, which is clearly very restrictive. In order to keep personal con-sumption down to this level, it will be necessary to maintain a very high levelof savings. Table 1 of Appendix IV shows that, in 1946, there wall be 9,480 million of current receipts in the hands of private persons and businesses.and that, if consumption expenditure is to be no higher than the level put forward with rates of taxation at the levels now proposed, no less than  1,540 million oJthese receipts must be saved. This represents a saving of 20 per cent, of netspendable receipts (i.e., of current receipts after the deduction of direct taxes),compared with 26 per cent, in 1944, and only 8 per cent, in 1938. At a time of high incomes, an abnormal backlog of demand, and a large mass of accumulatedsavings to spend, it will be difficult to keep real personal consumption down toa level 93 per cent, of pre-war, quite apart from any further restriction that maybe proposed in order to close the gap.25. It follows, therefore, that the &quot;gap&quot; of  470 million shown inTable C is a good deal smaller than the potential inflationary pressure It willbe a formidable administrative task for departments to restrain private invest-ment and personal consumption to the levels expressed by the departments on theexpenditure side of Table C. In so far as effective action can be taken to increasethe real national income, to reduce public expenditure or to reduce (e.g., by taxa-tion or by an intensified savings campaign) the amounts which private individuals or institutions attempt to spend on consumption goods or on capital investment,not only will the gap between the. supplies of resources and the demands upon them be reduced, but the inflationary pressure will also be diminished. In so far,however, as the gap between resources and the demands on them is filled by administrative action, which reduces the supplies made available for private consumption or for private investment, without diminishing the demand for them,the inflationary pressure, far from being reduced, will actually be intensified.
(b) Limits of control26. During the war it has been in a large measure possible to control the shape of the economy by means of man-power allocations. Only in certain casescan the decisions required for 1946 be made effective by such means. Thegovernment has absolute control over the size of the Armed Forces, and extensivecontrol over the numbers engaged on government work, including those engagedin producing equipment and supplies for the Services. But these are .all employ-ments which are to be reduced during the course of the year. Where man-power is to be increased, the governments control is riot of the same order. For an industry like building, which is not only the subject of powerful governmentinfluence but which also presents attractions to workers, labour targets may be practicable. But this will be much less the case with other industries, like coal-mining, where the governments interest is not supported by any such inherentattraction. Over industry as a whole, there will be some tendency for labour to approach its pre-war distribution rather than the distribution which is currentlymost desirable. And reliance will have mostly to be on relative.wages andconditions to effect any counter-movement.27. This difficulty in the method of control may be particularly disadvan-tageous to exports. There are few predominantly exporting industries and many,like distribution, which cater almost wholly for the home market. In so far aslabour which is newly made available spreads itself broadly throughout industry,therefore, the gain to exports from any given increase can only be a comparatively small proportion of the total addition, and unless the total volume available to industry is at a high level, the prospects of export production being well suppliedare not very great.28. There is a further difficulty which is likely to occur in the case of &quot;theexport programme. Whereas, a restriction in the money demand which con-sumers attempt to spend on the available supplies is bound to help exports, by reducing the domestic pressure of demand upon a limited supply of goods; a limitation on the amount of goods which may be produced as a means of reducingdemands on the limited supplies of resources, unaccompanied by any limitationof consumers&apos; demand, will increase the pressure of demand in relation toavailable supplies in the domestic market for consumption goods. It is thereforeliable seriously to reduce the supplies available for export markets.29. Finally, it must not be assumed that a cut in man-power or other resources, applied to any particular class of goods or services within the field of personal consumption will necessarily fall on the least essential supplies within that class.(c) The development of the economy30. Although it is possible, in this Survey, to show only annual estimates of national income and expenditure and of the balance of payments, and onlyhalf-yearly forecasts of the man-power situation, it is clear that there will bevery substantial changes in the economy over the year. By the end of 1946employment on behalf of exports and the home civil market will be only a little less than its pre-war level, and the margin may be quite small if the claims of theSe rvices for man-power are reduced below the levels assumed for this Survey.A good deal of activity will be taken up with the earlier processes of productionand with stocking up, but a considerable improvement in output will be in process; and by the middle of 1947 abnormally high requirements rather thanshortage of supplies, compared with pre-war, will be responsible for the inflationary gap which may still remain.31. This situation gives rise to two considerations which are relevant to current planning. First, the increase in work-in-progress of  550 million overthe year is directly susceptible of adjustment only in very small degree. Thisactivity represents the essential time-lag involved in filling up the pipe-line ofpeace-time production and distribution.- Whilst the process itself satisfies no immediate demand, the supply of end-products which satisfy demand for con-sumption, for export or for investment does depend upon it. The magnitude ofwork-in-progress will depend upon decisions taken in regard to those products.32. Secondly, the expected state of future demand may be particularlyrelevant for certain classes of demand, notably for capital goods, which couldmore readily be postponed if there was confidence that they could be met in 1947or 1948.   The sacrifice involved in postponement of such&apos;claims is not great if
such postponement is only for a comparatively short space of time. Moreover,there may be positive gain. For, if an early falling off in aggregate demand isexpected, the postponement of projects from the present until that time maymaterially assist in evening out the pressure on the community&apos;s resources.(d) Particular industries and areas33. Finally, it must be noted that, for an overall view to be taken, it isnecessary at the first stage to consider a few broad categories of demand. But thesupplies to meet these demands will be supplies from particular industries andfrom particular areas, and, at some stage, account must be taken of this. Thus,over the country as a whole, it may be desirable during 1946 to keep new factoryconstruction at a minimum. But whereas application of this principle to theLondon area may suggest that little factory building should be allowed, in certain other areas factory construction may be the most satisfactory way of making useof potentially unemployed labour and other resources, quite apart from anyneed for more factories in those areas to provide long-term employment.Planning Considerations34. With these four points as a background, it is possible to examine morerealistically the problem of the gap between requirements and supplies revealedin Section II, to consider how resources may be increased, and, to the extent thatan increase is not possible, how in the circumstances the available resources maybest be allocated.(a) Increasing resources35. The extent to which resources for domestic uses can be augmentedbeyond the levels assumed in the tables is limited. Any attempt further to enlargesupplies by means of overseas borrowing, even if practicable, is largely to be avoided. The long-term procurement of imports into this country can only be assured if our overseas finances are set on an even keel at an early date.Accordingly, the trend should be in that direction now, with a target date, saymid-1947, for the restoration of our current balance of payments, excludingoverseas military expenditure. Such restoration must mainly come through theexpansion of our export trade, but imports will need to be strictly controlledthroughout 1946. Import policy, however, may be considered in a wider context.There will be a strong case for imports which free for export resources otherwisenot obtainable; and, in particular, for imported machinery which, by makingpossible the immediate re-equipment of industries producing export goods, hasten the restoration of our overseas position.36. On the home side, the picture drawn in the tables assumes that industrial dislocation and unrest do not lead to any large body of labour beingunemployed or idle for any length of time, and that hours of work, which arealready back to pre-war, are not reduced further. Each of these assumptionsmay require positive government action if it&quot; is to be made a fact. The numberof women in.industry at the end of 1946 is estimated to be only 1 per cent, morethan at mid-1939. An important additional contribution to our resources wouldresult if 200,000 out of the 500,000 women, which is the expected abnormalwastage from industry during the year, could be persuaded to remain. Theywould not, however, close the man-power gap, and whilst their contribution tooutput would be substantial, the gap between target national income and expendi-ture would still exceed  400 million.37. An increase in the national resources would be obtained if unemploy-ment in 1946 could be reduced below the anticipated level of 500,000. this could, perhaps, be achieved by following two courses of action to ensure that inthe Development Areas no pockets of unemployment are allowed to develop :first, to provide employment within depressed localities for less mobile workers,and, secondly, to encourage the more mobile to seek employment in areas with goodemployment opportunities. At present the general man-power position is one of acute shortage of labour, as is indicated by the fact that the total of insuredpersons (men aged 14-64; women aged 14-59) registered as unemployed on the12th November last represents a national percentage of unemployment of 2 percent.; in some areas of the country unemployment is increasing more rapidly and[31071] c
the percentage is well above 2 per cent. In Wales it is nearly 9 per cent., inNorthumberland and Durham nearly 5 per cent., and in Scotland over 3 per cent.;in South-West Scotland and the Highlands and Islands the percentage is substantially greater than 3 per cent., e.g., Stornoway 25 per cent. There are alsosmall pockets of unemployment in other areas, e.g.,&apos;West Cumberland, Wigan,parts of South and West Yorkshire. A considerable proportion of the menunemployed in these areas are middle-aged or elderly, of poor physique, with little or no skill and immobile; most of the women who are unemployed are alsoimmobile. If unemployment in Scotland, Wales and the Northern region couldbe brought down to the level of other regions, an additional 100,000 workers would be working. It is to be anticipated that in 1946, there will be a tendency for unemployment in these regions to remain differentially high, and if we could do no more than absorb into industry the present differential unemployment there,we should increase the national income by about  50 million.(b) Allocating resources38. If only because of the difficulties of control elsewhere, the simplest pointof attack would seem to be upon government current expenditure for goods and services, estimated for 1946 at  2,705 million, of which the Armed Forces andtheir equipment and supply account for a large, but not the only important,part. Here, since it is the governments own expenditure that is in question,direct control can be exerted. More rapid or more extensive demobilisation fromthe Forces than has here been assumed would provide the double advantage ofincreasing the total national income as well as reducing a large item of expendi-ture. In so far as the recent recommendations of the Defence Committee are carried out and the Forces draw upon existing stocks for their supplies ratherthan demand new production, expenditure on the side of the Services&apos; supply is already planned to fall. This might yield  150 million. If, at the same time,the Armed Forces themselves were 300,000 less throughout the year, the net contribution towards closing the inflationary gap, including the addition toincome, might be another  150 million. Every additional 100,000 would release a further  50 million.39. Exports are at the other extreme. - It would be dangerous deliberatelyto lower the export target. On the other hand, its attainment provides a most difficult administrative problem and achievement of the target will continue tobe problematical as long as there is a large volume of home demand unsatisfied.How decisions to close the gap by means of restrictions on the supplies madeavailable for domestic consumption would react upon exports is difficult to fore-cast, because much would depend on the particular way in which any general cutwas applied. But any decisions to cut the programme for home supplies oughtto take account of the fact that adverse reactions upon exports may be hard toavoid.40. The various parts of home demand upon which further limitations mightbe imposed are personal consumption, private capital investment and governmentcapital investment. Claims on behalf of these are valued at  6,100 million, 710 million and  345 million, respectively; in the last item, the housing programme constitutes the major element.41. It will be necessary, by all means available, to restrain consumptiondemand, bu  it must be recognised that in 1946 personal consumption will represent the point at which government control is at its weakest. In certainfields, notably food and clothing, control will still be fully possible. Elsewhere,however, there will be serious difficulty and fiscal measures to restrain demand will be important. Measures directed to control supply may be impossibleeffectively to operate against a background of free labour movement, and will do nothing to effect an equitable distribution.42. To meet all the other claims in full by cutting personal consumptionbelow the levels already assumed, is impracticable. In many fields it would beimpossible to prevent cuts in production beyond a certain point from falling, notupon home supplies as would be intended, but upon exports. And this breaking-point would occur sufficiently early in a sufficiently large number of cases, forthe cuts outstanding to be too large to impose in the fields remaining without involving such steps as, for example, reducing the clothing ration below its present level. If the clothing ration were held throughout the year at its present leveland no increases were permitted in the supplies of processed foods or more
important in furniture, furnishings and hardware, the total alleviation mightbe  200 million.43. The importance of the total sum of private investment, or net capital formation, compared with other claims, is difficult to assess. On the one hand,the well-known principle of Employment Policy that capital investment shouldbe restrained in inflationary periods and stored up against the impact of a subsequent slump, seems to justify the most careful scrutiny of all investment projects. At.a time when demands for current supplies are so very urgent, thecase for postponing long-term projects is strong, particularly when an easiersituation can be foreseen in the not-too-distant future. On the other hand, itis undoubtedly true that in many parts of the economy restoration of supplies to the levels, and at prices, assumed will not be possible unless a substantial amount of deferred capital expenditure is undertaken. Moreover, high buildingcosts and the like though not high interest rates may be expected to discourageother than urgent capital construction for some time to come. But a net capitalexpenditure of  710 million represents a gross investment, inclusive of new private house-building of  1,110 million; and although this is only a slight increase in&apos;real investment compared with pre-war, it is difficult to believe that a cut of10 per cent, this year, if carefully applied, could not be effected without damagingessential restorations or preventing really vital capital development. Such a cut would remove  110 million of the pressure upon, expenditure. As partialoffsets, fresh consideration might be given to possible methods of securingindustrial equipment in this period other than by using current home resources in particular, by German reparations and by a more rapid disposal of surplusmachine tools in this country.44. The target for employment in the building and civil engineering industry for the end of 1946 is above the 1939 level of 1-31 million; but it isin line with the 1 - 25 million for the building industry alone, which in Cmd. 6428was announced as the strength to which the industry was to be built up over aperiod. Many elements contribute to the desirability of attaining quickly a largeoutput in this field the high importance of house-building, the need for repair of war damage, the special claims of the Development Areas, the heavy arrears of maintenance and the need for improving by all means conditions in Britishindustry conducive to industrial efficiency. Nevertheless, the question may beraised whether we should build up the building labour force so quickly as thesefigures assume.45. If, as seems clear, however, no one element in national expenditure canbe made to bear the whole brunt of the reduction needed to close the gap betweentarget national income and expenditure, it follows that contributions will haveto come from as many elements as possible.Summary46. (i) The requirements put forward by Departments for 1946 represent,not the amount which private individuals or private or public institu-tions would buy in a free market, but the expenditures which departments would most like to see satisfied. On this basis, there isa gap of some  470 million between requirements and supplies. Thefollowing points summarise the ways in which the gap might be filled.It is to be borne in mind, however, that action to reduce supplies available for private consumption or investment, while it will help to close the gap, will actually increase the inflationary pressure, unless there is some accompanying action to reduce the amounts which private persons attempt to spend for these purposes.(ii) If 200,000 extra women could be persuaded to remain at work, this gapmight be reduced by  70 million. If it were - possible to reduce unemployment by 100,000 below the 500,000 assumed in this Survey(for example, by avoiding the growth of localised pockets of unemploy-ment), it might reduce the gap by another  50 million.(iii) The Armed  Forces might economise  in  their  demands  for new production to the extent of  150 million, by drawing further onaccumulated stocks and postponing replacements of existingequipment.[31071] c 2
(iv) A reduction of 300,000 in the Armed Forces throughout the year might reduce the gap by  150 million, to which every further reduction of100,000 would add a saving of another  50 million,(v) If the clothing ration were held at its present level and no increases were permitted in supplies of processed foods, furniture,- furnishingsand hardware, the gap would be reduced by  200 million.(vi) A 10 per cent, reduction in private gross investment would reduce the gap by some  110 million,(vii) In making the above calculations, it is assumed that requirementshaving the highest priority are met, and that these requirements willbe safeguarded against loss in any cuts that may be imposed. In fact,this latter point cannot always be guaranteed. In particular, the incidence of cuts intended to reduce the supplies available for personal consumption or for private investment (see (v) and (vi) above) might very easily fall partly or wholly upon exports unless special steps were taken to prevent this happening.APPENDIX INotes on Table A : Requirements and supply of man-power. Detailed statements of requirements have been obtained, from depart-ments. They are summarised in Table A and are given in more detail in the table of this appendix. The requirements have been given by departments inthe knowledge that all demands for labour during 1946 could not be met. Theydo not, therefore, state the total amount of labour which departments would liketo have but only requirements for which some priority is asked.2. A statement in terms of persons, rather than in terms of special skills orof local need and availability, may be misleading. For example, to give the Boardof Trade the amount of labour for which it asks for the Group III industries isnot necessarily to satisfy the Departments requirement for cotton spinning opera-tives in Lancashire or clothing workers in Leeds. Conversely, an overall shortageof man-power may not be inconsistent with a surplus of labour and a shortageof work in areas particularly affected by the cutting of war contracts.3. Coverage The figures relate to men aged 14-64 and women aged 14-59in Great Britain. Corresponding figures are not yet available for NorthernIreland.4. Military requirements Military commitments are at present underreview. In consequence only provisional figures for 1946 are at present availablefor the man-power requirements of the Services and for their equipment and supply.5. Metal, engineering and chemical industries The numbers needed inthese industries are greater than before the war.   They are wanted to provide (a) equipment and supplies for the Armed Forces;(b) machinery and other equipment for the reconversion of home industry;(c) durable consumer goods which private persons have not been able to buyduring the war years;(d) housing fitments; and(e) the major part of our exports of manufactured goods.Export requirements for these industries as stated by the Board of Trade aredouble the man-power engaged on export work at the middle of 1939 and fourand a half times as. great as in June 1945. Home civil requirements as stated bythe departments concerned for the end of 1946 are in aggregate 50 per cent, abovethe level of July 1939.6. The Ministry of Labour estimate that total man-power requirements forthis group of industries is 3-8 million at the middle and 3-9 million at the endof 1946 as compared with a strength of 3-1 million before the war and a forecaststrength of 3 - 4 million at the end of 1945. On current experience of the loss oflabour by these industries following the cessation of war contracts (and on theassumption that demobilised men and women return to their former occupations
and industries) they estimate that the actual strength of this group of industriesat the end of the year will be about 3 million or some 800 thousand less thanrequirements.7. Other manufacturing industries Requirements for other manufactur-ing industries as stated by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Food would leave the strength of these industries engaged on home civil work below the pre-war level though about 70 per cent, above the level of September 1945. Becauseof the needs of the home market, export requirements in this group of industries are given as no more than 12 per cent, above the pre-war figure even at the endof 1946.8. Coal mining Because of the unlikelihood of raising the labour force ofthe industry, the Ministry of Fuel and Power have asked at the middle of 1946for no greater labour force in coal mining than at July 1945, but an additional10,000 men are asked for by the end of 1946. - Even then the labour force would still be more than 50,000 below the pre-war level.9. Distribution The distributive trades contributed labour on a large scale to the Forces and the munition industries during the early years of the war. Itis, therefore, to be expected that during 1946 the industry will build up its strength with demobilisation and the cutting of war contracts. The figures givenfor 1946 in Table A are estimates made by the Ministry of Labour of the strengththe industry is likely to attain. By the end of 1946, the Ministry of Labourforecast that the labour force in distribution will be 276 million, compared withnearly 2-9 million at July 1939, and an estimated strength at the end of 1945of close on 2-2 million.10. National and local government service Requirements for national andlocal government including the N.F.S. and police fall over the second half of 1946,but are much above the pre-war level as a result of the expansion in the industrial and non-industrial staffs of the national government service.11. Requirements and supply ^Total requirements of man-power as givenby the departments are 20,310,000 and 20,546,000 at the middle and the end of1946 respectively. Over the year the total man-power available is expected to fallby 880,000, largely because of an expected abnormal wastage from industry of half a million women. Normal retirements are also expected to be 380,000 greaterthan the number of new recruits to the working population. A rise in unemploy-ment during 1946 is also allowed for. Balancing requirements against the anticipated supply of labour, a gap of 1,346,000 is shown for December 1946.12. By the end of 1946, there is expected to be a rise in the number employedin the Services and industry of 720,000 over the 1939 level, which is whollyexplained by the anticipation that unemployment in 1946 will be lower than before the war. This increased labour supply will not, on the basis of military requirements, be available for export and home civil work; for even at the endof 1946 853,000 more men and women are wanted in the Services or producingsupplies for the Services than at June 1939.13. Thus at the end of 1946 if military requirements are met, the demandfor labour for expanding exports, making good war damage, raising civilian consumption and making good arrears of capital upkeep and development mustbe met from a supply less than in 1939.14. Forecast of the distribution of labour During 1946, men and women from the Forces and war work will be seeking employment of their own choice, andto some extent the allocation of labour will be pre-determined by this fact.Broadly speaking, the man-power deficit is expected by the Ministry of labour to fall proportionately much more heavily on the Group I than on the Group IIIindustries, and this will inevitably affect the form of production in 1946. In termsof expenditure this will mean either that the deficit will fall chiefly on capital investment or exports, or, if steps are taken to concentrate man-power resources in the Group I industries on to such work, the deficit in this group of industries will fall on the production of durable consumption goods.15. Detailed statistics of requirements More detailed figures of depart-mental requirements of man-power are given in the following table.

APPENDIX *IINotes on Table B : The Balance of Payments   .1. Table B shows the balance of payments of the United Kingdom with therest of the world. Requirements of foreign exchange have been estimated with both the difficulties of the currency position and the shortage of world supplies in mind, and they represent tentative estimates of what will be needed to achieve the contemplated use of United Kingdom resources and the required levels of consumption. At the time of writing, when the outcome of the financial discussions with the United States is not known, the figures are necessarily veryprovisional.2. Imports The requirements of exchange for food imports representsupplies of imported food sufficient to enable some slight improvement to bemade on the national diet of 1944. The total cost of imports in 1946 at  550million is almost identical with &apos;the value of food imports in 1944, which werecomposed of about  310 million of purchased food,  190 million of Lend-Leasefood and  50 million on Mutual Aid from Canada. Requirements for rawmaterials would provide imports in 1946 at a slightly lower level than in 1944when imports were obtained with Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid assistance. Pay-ments for tobacco at  40 million in 1946 compare with purchases of  22 million-in 1944 and about  10 million of tobacco obtained on Lend-Lease. The relatively small requirement for 1946 included in the table for other imports reflects theneed for the utmost economy in our expenditure of dollars.3. Exports Receipts from exports have been estimated on the basicassumption that the man-power requirements stated by the Board of Trade are met fully and promptly. The estimate of payments for British exports in 1946is necessarily subject to considerable uncertainty at this stage because of thedifficulty of estimating with precision the delay between the commencement ofnew work and deliveries from factories, and between deliveries and paymentsreceived from abroad.4. In 1938 coal exports amounted to 36 million tons as compared withthe estimate of 3 million tons for 1945. It is hoped that there will be an expansionof coal exports in 1946, which if converted into terms of man-power would be equivalent to the employment on coal exports at the end of the year of 50,000miners as compared with 25.000, the present figure.5. In real terms recorded exports (as distinct from payments) may run in1946 at a rate 75 per cent, of the 1938 level, and at the end of 1946 may be running at a somewhat greater annual rate than in 1938. But the allocation of man-powerto meet the Board of Trade&apos;s export requirements, though necessary, if suchresults are to be obtained, will not in itself be sufficient to ensure this progress towards the target of raising the volume of exports by 75 per cent. It will alsobe necessary to obtain smooth reconversion and to avoid important disturbancesor particular shortages of labour or materials.6. Overseas war expenditure In two important respects the account for1946 differs from that for 1938. The war has brought a large new item on thedebit side of the account in the form of overseas war expenditure. The figures in Table B represent net Avar expenditure overseas, i.e., the excess of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s expenditure overseas over that of other countries in the UnitedKingdom. In 1944 this net item (AAdrich includes the cost in foreign exchange of reciprocal Aid) Avas greater than the cost of food purchases from abroad, while for 1946 this item represents 40 per cent, of the adverse balance.7. Interest, profits and dividends Net interest, profits and dividendsreceived are estimated to fall between 1938 and 1944 by  110 million (and inaddition to this fall in our money income there has occurred a reduction in the purchasing power of sterling in terms of imported goods). This fall is explained by the liquidation of British investments OAjerseas and the interest payable ongroAving indebtedness to other countries.
APPENDIX IIINotes on Table C : National Income and expenditure .   Table C presents accounts of the national income and expenditure of theUnited Kingdom.   Detailed tables and notes are given in Appendix IV.2. General assumptions- So far as possible these accounts have been drawnup on assumptions consistent with the other tables. Specifically, income has been,estimated for 1946 on the assumption that the total working population of insuredages is as given in Table A (i.e., slightly above the level of 1939) and that unemployment among insured workers is 300,000 at the beginning and 500,000at the middle and at the end of 1946. Income and expenditure have, however,been estimated for the United Kingdom while Table A relates only to GreatBritain. Assumptions about the strength of the Armed Forces and aboutdemobilisation are the same for both tables, while departments have been asked toestimate expenditure on the basis of their man-power requirements. allowance has been made for income earned by domestic servants (and for expenditure on domestic service) who are not included in Table A in the working population.Written into the national expenditure as a negative item, i.e., as a negative claim on resources, is an adverse balance consistent with that given in Table B.3. Wage Rates -Wages have been calculated on the assumption that wage rates as estimated by the Ministry of Labour index rise from their September 1945level of 151 per cent, of September 1939 to 154 in March 1946 and 157 inSeptember 1946, a rise of one-half a point a month. The rise in the index overthe whole of the war period has been steeper than this rate, while since January1944 wage rates have risen fairly consistently each month by such an increment-After taking the advice of the Ministry of Labour on this matter, it was consideredadvisable to assume a similar rise during 1946 to allow for the reconsideration of wage agreements being and likely to be made now that the war has ended. despite the rise in wage rates and the assumption that the tendency to reduce hours ofwork will encourage the continuance of some overtime working, average earnings are assumed to fall below the level reached in 1944. Both the wages and salariesbills are, however, estimated to be above the level of 1944 as a result of the increasein the labour force in industry occurring through demobilisation. This increase is, however, almost wholly offset by the decline in pay and allowances to the forces and Auxiliary Services.4. Profits and interest Some uncertainty exists as to the amount of profitand interest which should be estimated for 1946. Two considerations have led toa fairly substantial writing down of this category of income in the face of therise in wages and salaries which would normally be reflected in the movementof profits. In the first place, traders will employ more people in 1946 to improveservice and protect goodwill in advance of increased supplies of merchandise, and.these additional expenses will eat into profit margins. Secondly, industry v. ill toa very considerable extent be engaged in reconversion during 1946, and activitymust necessarily be absorbed in building up physical working capital at theexpense of expanding sales and earning a corresponding profit margin.5. Prices and costs All figures of expenditure have been estimated at theprices expected in 1946, and, so far as possible in the time available, these prices have been made consistent with the wage rates assumed. The relation betweenchanges in wage rates and in prices of domestically produced output depends uponthe alteration in output per head. It has not seemed prudent in a transition yearlike 1946 to make any substantial allowance for increases in productivity, andtherefore something only slightly above the 1945 level has been assumed. In so.far as the increase in productivity has been under-estimated, the prices assumedwill be too high and requirements by departments will in terms of man-power beoverstated or in terms of improvements of supplies will be understated.6. Personal expenditure on consumption The estimates of personalexpenditure on consumption as well as the estimates for the yield of direct and indirect taxation assume the continuance of the present rates of central govern-* ment direct and indirect taxation. Some increase in local rates has been assumed to meet the rise in local authority rate-fund expenditure. As stated above, thelevel of personal consumption shown is based on the assumption that the man-power requirements of the departments responsible for providing goods and services for personal consumption are met in full, in detail and promptly For[31071] D
example, a substantial increase is estimated for electricity and gas; an estimate-which is linked with a requirement for each industry of 15,000 more men overthe level of mid-1944. Again, the Board of Trade emphasise that in particular the estimated increase in personal expenditure on clothing can only be attainedif smooth reconversion is achieved, and if man-power requirements are met earlyin each half-year, and particularly in the spinning and weaving sections of the textile industries. The estimates contain no margin for difficulties or seriousdetailed deficiencies, e.g., of materials or labour.7. For the rationed goods, food, clothing and furniture, departmentalrequirements allow only for very small rises on the present levels of consumption and do not in any way represent the increase in supplies which departments would wish consumers to enjoy in the first calendar year after the war.8. Government expenditure on goods and services This figure is necessarilyuncertain, since two-thirds of it represents defence expenditure or more strictlypayments to the Forces and the value of work done for the Service and supply departments; and any change in the strength of the Services or in the munitions programme would have an immediate effect on this estimate.9. Capital formation Requirements for total net fixed capital formationare shown in Table C as  1,055 million. The corresponding figure for grossinvestment is  1,595 million, which after allowing for the rise in prices may in real terms be 5 to 10 per cent, above the 1938 level. The proportionate rise innet investment is considerably more than this, perhaps as much as 45 per cent.,because the Inland Revenue allowances for depreciation on existing capital assetsare not increased with a rise in the cost of replacement.10. Requirements for capital formation may be placed against the back-ground of the country&apos;s capital losses during the war. Domestic disinvestmentbetween 1940 and 1944 amounted to about  900 million; war damage has been estimated at  2,000 million; overseas disinvestment has amounted to  4,200million.11. Indirect taxes A subtraction from expenditure is made of thepayments of indirect taxes (less subsidies), in order to offset those amounts ofthe prices paid by purchasers which are the result of fiscal policy and which haveno counterpart on the income side of the account.APPENDIX iv. Tables 1 to 4 have been designed to be read consecutively. The numbers in brackets after the items in Tables 1, 2 and 3 are given for ease of reference in-order to refer to the contra items in these tables. Thus, those items in Tables 1to 3 which have no such contra item do not have any reference number after themand only these items appear at all in the summary, Table 4. The numbers In brackets in Table 4 refer to entries in the preceding three tables, e.g., item 49 isthe difference between items 33 (a) and 29 (a) of Table 3.2. The balance of private expenditure in 1946 shown in Table I is theresidue left after payment is made from target private receipts for the requiredlevel of personal expenditure and for direct taxation and contributions. Ifexpenditure is reduced below the required level, the balance of private receiptswill be larger and more savings will be available under item 28 (a) in the capital account given in Table 3, so effecting a corresponding reduction in the gap shownin that table. -3. The deficit on current account for central and local government shown inTable 2 is the difference between government receipts and outlays on current-account. If government expenditure is reduced below the estimated level for1946, the negative savings to be carried to the Capital Account in Table 3 (item28 (b)) will be reduced and the gap shown in that table correspondingly less.4. The gap shown in Table 3, as the previous two paragraphs show, is basedupon the assumptions that personal expenditure is as given in Table I and government expenditure on current account is as given in Table 2. If expenditure under these two headings is reduced, the gap shown in&apos; Table 3 as a deficiency of savings or as an excess of investment demands will be correspondingly reduced.5. More detailed figures of personal expenditure are given in Tables 5 and 6,and of domestic capital formation in Table 7.

NOTES ON TABLES IN APPENDIX IV -    ^Tables 1 to general note Table 1 is a receipts and payments account for the private sector of the economy, covering all persons and private businesses, and Table 2 similarly torcentral and local government. Table 3 combines the capital accounts of both thepublic and the private sectors of the economy. Table 4 which is identical withTable C in the text of the Survey, summarises the information contained mTables 1, 2 and 3. .2. Table 1-On the left-hand side of the account there appear the. currentreceipts of all persons and undistributed profits of companies, consisting of incomes from work and the ownership of property (items 1 to 5) and sums paidby public authorities to recipients who fulfil certain conditions (items 6 and 7).3. The right-hand side of the account analyses the disposal of these receipts,on the purchase of consumer goods and services (item 9), and in taxation and compulsory contributions (items 10 and 11), the balance being saved (item 12).This balance is simply a residual: the 1946 figure represents, therefore, whatwould be saved if total receipts and payments were as stated in the table.4. Table 2-On the left-hand side the receipts of the government and localauthorities are given : (a) direct taxes and compulsory contributions (items 14 and 16);(b) indirect taxes and compulsory contributions, which are items in thecost of production and enter into the price of goods and services(items 15, 17 and 18);(c) the profits of government trading services such as the Post Office(item 19);and (d) the excess of current outgoings over revenue (item 20).The right-hand side distinguishes the following types of expenditure : (e) national debt interest (item 22);(/) other transfers to private recipients, i.e., payments not made for work done (items 23 and 24);(g) subsidies (item 25);and (h) expenditure on goods and services provided on current account(item 26).Several of the items shown as receipts in this table appear in Table 1 aspayments by private persons and businesses; similarly payments made by goverh-ment in Table 2 appear as receipts by private persons and businesses in Table 1.5. Table 3 On the left-hand side are brought together the sums currentlyset aside by business and public authorities to cover the replacement of capital equipment (item 29) and the sums available to pay for additions to capital equipment, i.e., the balance of private receipts from Table .1 (item 28 (a)) and thegovernment deficit on current account (negative in each of the years shown) fromTable 2 (item 28 (&amp;)).6. On the right-hand side appears expenditure on maintaining and adding to the various types of fixed capital assets (item 33), on increasing inven-tories and work in progress (items 34 and 35) and on adding to the cbuntry&apos;snet claims on foreign countries (item 36). The foreign balance has been negativein each of the years.7. For 1946 an additional item is listed : the gap between the gross capitalexpenditure contemplated and the resources available for this purpose on theassumption that income and current expenditure are as shown in Tables 1 and 2.Such a gap can exist in prospect only; capital expenditure is necessarily equalto the sums set aside for this purpose. The gap will necessarily be bridged in1946, e.g., either through capital expenditure plans being cut or&apos;through savingbeing increased at the expense of personal or government current expenditureon goods and services, or through an increase in the national income.8. Table 4-This table is the result of adding up the three preceding tablesand omitting items which occur on both sides of the accounts (transfer paymentsdirect taxes and savings) or both positively and negatively on the same side ofthe account. Certain other items are not shown separately in Table 4 but arededucted from some other item on the opposite side of the account; thus, deprecia-tion allowances are deducted from gross capital formation and indirect taxes are treated as negative subsidies.
9. There remain, on the receipts side, the income payments which absorb the whole net product of industry and on the expenditure side the various out-goings on goods and services on current and capital account. The gap of Table 3,which previously appeared as an excess of required capital expenditure overprospective saving, now appears as an excess of required total expenditure overtarget income.Notes on particular items in Tables 1 to 410. Small transfer payments  24 million is included for family allowances,which will start being payable in August, 1946.   (See item 6.)11. E.P.T. credits The total exchequer liability is estimated to be about 250 million. It is assumed that there will be no delay in making these refundsand that payments will be made on account in advance of final settlement, so that four-fifths of the liabilitv will have been discharged by the end of 1946. (Seeitem 7(6).)12.   War damage compensation This figure is made up as follows :   millionPayments by War Damage Commission &quot; Cost of works &quot; payments...      ...      ...      ... 100Payments in respect of repairs already effected to non-government public utilities       ...      ... 25Payments by War Risks (Marine) Insurance Fund    ... 10Payments by War Risks (Commodities) Insurance Fund 1Payments by Board of Trade under Part II of the war damage Acts Business scheme       ...      ...       ...      ...       ... 6Private chattels       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 8150It has been assumed that no value payments will be made by the War DamageCommission in 1946 and that in 1946 the Board of Trade will not pay claimsexcept where there is a strong specific case on grounds of hardship, national interest, &amp;c, for immediate payment. If value payments by the Commission were permitted their amount might be  115 million; claims admitted for deferred pay-ment by the Board of Trade will probably be about  90 million.   (See Item 7 (c).)13. Direct taxes The rates of tax at present in force or already announcedhave been assumed.   (See item 10.)14. National insurance contributions No account has been taken of theincrease in contributions when the National Insurance Scheme comes into force.,(See items 16 and 17.)15. Indirect taxes Indirect taxes of the central government have been assumed to continue at present rates. Purchase tax has been assumed to yieldin 1946 nearly double the 1944 revenue. Some increase in local rates has been allowed for.   (See item 15.)16. Profits of government trading undertakings The biggest single itemunder this head has recently been the income accruing to the government underthe Railway Control Agreement. It is estimated that this will fall to zero in1946; the other items, all rather small, have been neglected.   (See item 19.)17. Government deficit on current account This item is equal to that partof government borrowing not used to repay debt or add to capital assets. (Seeitem 20.)18. Government current expenditure on goods and services:Defence Equal to the Treasury&apos;s estimates of expenditure in the fiscal year1946-7 phis an estimate of the extent to which expenditure on the pay and allow-ances of the Forces and Auxiliary Services will in the calendar year 1946 exceedcorresponding expenditure in the fiscal year. No adjustment has been made tothe other components of defence expenditure, on the assumption that payments in the fiscal year will be roughly equal to work done for the government in the calendar year. If an attempt had been made to estimate payments in the calendar year an opposite adjustment would have had to be made to item 34 inTable 3, the increase in work in progress. It is important to realise, however,,[31071] e
that to the extent that payments do lag behind work done, the figure given hereunder-estimates government expenditure.   (See item 26 (a) (i).)Other central government expenditure An estimate made by deductingidentifiable transfer payments from a Treasury estimate of expenditure on civil and revenue votes. It includes expenditure by extra-budgetary funds, e.g., theUnemployment Fund&apos;s costs of administration.   (See item 26 (a) (ii).)19.   Depreciation allowances:Private This estimate follows the Inland Revenue&apos;s practice of grantingwear and tear allowances under Schedule D and repairs allowances under shedule A of the income tax : it is, therefore, an estimate not of what firms dothemselves set aside but of what they set aside tax-free. In a period of rising prices the statutory allowances, which are calculated on the original cost of assets,do not in fact cover the full cost of replacement of assets.   (See item 29 (a).)Public Amortisation by local authorities, repayment of annuities by thePost Office and maintenance of highways and bridges and central government buildings.   (See item 29 (&amp;).)20. Change in value of inventories and work in progress This represents the increase in the value of stocks (i.e., including any increase due to rises in price)since this is believed to agree with usual income tax practice. Any downwardadjustment of these figures to eliminate the effect of price-changes would involve an equal downward adjustment of the figures of profits on the other side of the account.   (See item 34.)21. Change in value of exported goods not yet paid for This item isimportant only in a period of rapidly expanding (or declining) exports. (Seeitem 35.)Tables 5 and 6Personal expenditure on consumption22. In estimating personal expenditure on consumers&apos; goods and servicesallowance has been made for the increase in the civilian population due todemobilisation. The income in kind of the Services, i.e., food and clothing,together with clothing provided on release, is included in personal expenditure inTable C, and is shown separately in Table 5 of Appendix IV.23. Food The Ministry of Pood state that the diet which is reflected inthe figure of personal expenditure on food in 1946 is much inferior to that whichthe Department would like to see in the first calendar year after the war, butthat the estimates are constrained by shortage of dollars and the stringency of world supplies. In real terms, total civilian consumption would be about 10 percent, greater than in 1944, but about one-half of this increase is to feeddemobilised men and women, while the remaining half is accounted for by a forecast increase in supplies of fish, fruit and certain processed foods.24. Drink and tobacco Expenditure is expected to be above the current-level in 1946, as the supply position will be rather easier and, as long as a shortageof alternative objects of expenditure continues, demand can be assumed to be strong enough to take up available supplies.25. Household goods Target expenditure on furniture is estimated topurchase 46 per cent, of the 1938 supplies, but by the end of 1946 this may beraised to about 75 per cent. At the end of 1946 there will still have to be a schemefor reserving wooden furniture for priority classes, although the effectiveallowance may be raised to a higher level and deferred units may be honoured.26. Clothing In real terms target expenditure on clothing in 1946 is assumed to be 65 per cent, of the 1938 level and about 5 per cent, higher thanin 1944. By the end of 1946 it is hoped that supplies will be sufficient to allowexpenditure to reach 80 per cent, of the 1938 level and to be about 30 per cent,above that of 1944. In terms of coupons, expenditure throughout 1946 is equivalent to a basic ration of 48; i.e., the level prevailing from June 1942 to january 1945, while at the end of the year it is equivalent to a basic ration of70 coupons; the same as in the first year of rationing. Pre-war consumption wasthe equivalent of about 100 coupons for the adult.27. Travel It has been assumed that between one-seventh and one-eighthof the new motor cars provided for civilian use will be available for purchasersrequiring cars for personal use, and that the basic petrol ration will continuethrough 1946 but at a level 20 per cent, higher than at present.
A big increase over 1944 has been assumed for railway travel in 1946. the expected reductions in the amount of travel by troops paid for by the governmentwill be some offset to this. The increase over 1938 forecast by the Ministry of war transport is, however, very considerable.28. Expenditure on other goods A considerable increase has been assumedfor personal expenditure on the item &quot;other goods,&quot; which consist of amiscellaneous collection of things, the supplies and prices of some pf which are difficult to control. For these, 1946 expenditure is less a target than an estimateof what is likely to happen, although it might be desirable to divert resources tothe production of things more urgently needed.29. Miscellaneous services An increase between 1944 and 1946 of 250,000in the number of private domestic servants has been assumed.30. Adjustment The figures in all the previous categories include expenditure in the United Kingdom by tourists from overseas and Allied troopstemporarily resident in this country and exclude expenditure abroad by Britishtourists and troops. An adjustment is needed to convert the total to a total of purchases out of British income.   The estimate for 1946 is no more than a guess.Table 7Capital formation31. Building and contracting work other than by public utilities Thefigures are based on estimates of the man-power likely to be available in thehuilding and contracting industries in each quarter of 1946. These estimates have been agreed between the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Labour.The figures of expenditure are, therefore, not departmental targets so much as a forecast of what will be possible if high priority continues to be given to thebuilding industry&apos;s demands for labour and if the present relative attractiveness-of the industry continues. A small allowance has been made for building work done by firms outside the building industry. The figures are estimates of the valueof work done (i.e., including work on uncompleted projects).32. The estimate for house-building includes provision for expenditure of 26 million by the Ministry of Works on the erection of about 80,000 temporarypre-fabricated houses.  The cost of manufacture is shown separately in the table.33. The Board of Trade indicate that their requirements for industrial and^commercial buildings are based upon a realisation of the high priority to be-attached to house-bulding and that, therefore, low requirements are entered for- entertainment and for shops. The important needs are for factories, particularlyin the development areas, the replacement of war-damaged industrial and commercial buildings, and warehouses.34. Transport and highways The estimates of new capital development bythe Ministry of War Transport represent what could be incurred in 1946, on theassumption that there will be a stringency of labour and materials, ajnd that noactive steps will be taken by the Government to promote large capital expenditure by transport undertakings during the year. Expenditure will in any case be higher in 1947 and later years until the worse arrears of maintenance have been^ overtaken, and, if it were government policy, large capital expenditure on usefulroad, railway and dock schemes could be incurred at short notice, even without taking account of schemes such as the Mid-Scotland Ship Canal, extensive railwayelectrification, bridging of major estuaries and other large projects.35. Railways For railways the figures represent the Ministry of WarTransports estimate of what is desirable. Of the total,  85 million represents the cost of normal maintenance and renewals and  24 million the cost of new development and deferred maintenance. In each case half the amount is for building and civil engineering work on the track and half for rolling-stock, plant and equipment.  Prices have been assumed to be 70 per cent, above pre-war levels.36. Civil aviation -The estimate includes the production of civil aircraft,ground works and equipment, and development expenditure.37. Hightuays and bridges The estimated expenditure on highways and bridges is based on a forecast made, two years ago of expenditure in a &quot; normal &quot;post-war year, scaled down on the assumption that the man-power available in1946 will be considerably less than in 1938.  65 million is for maintenance(including  11 million on trunk roads) and  4 million for new roads (including 1 million on trunk roads).
38. Electricity undertakings The total for electricity undertakings ismade up of expenditure of  5 million by the Central Electricity Board and north of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board,  30 million by local authorities and 15 million by companies. In all, building work included amounts to about 7 million. Uncertainty about the future organisation of the industry mightdelay the start of some of the schemes of development included in the estimates.39. Coal mining Capital expenditure in 1946 depends on how soon theNational Coal Board is set up and how quickly it can get into its stride on itsreorganisation plans.40. Agriculture The estimate for agricultural machinery is made up of purchases of  20 million by farmers (of which  12 million is for replacement)and of about  f million by private contractors. In 1943-44 farmers purchasedmachinery costing  26-27 million; on general grounds a decline from this levelwas to be expected and dealers&apos; sales since then have confirmed this. The figureof  14 million for live-stock represents the net increase in the value that isexpected during 1946. It includes some expansion of the dairy herd andthe recovery in numbers of other classes of stock. Only two agricultural items are separately shown in Table 7 : agricultural machinery and live-stock; this does not, however, exhaust the capital formation contemplated by the. industry,which in all amounts to  90 million (about equally divided between farmers andlandlords).   The other components are mainly building and construction work.41. Plant and machinery required by other industries This figure is anestimate of what can be achieved if the man-power asked for by the Board ofTrade is actually available. This implies an output (on a &quot; work done &quot; basis and not on the basis of deliveries).in real terms 60 per cent, higher than in 1938;prices are assumed to be 80 per cent, above the 1938 level. About a quarter ofthe 1946 output is likely to be represented not by finished goods but by an increasein the value of work in progress and has therefore been deducted from this itemand included in the increase in work in progress.42. The figure for 1946 makes no allowance for any second-hand machinerythat may be available from Government sources. It is estimated, however, that ministry of Supply sales of surplus stores (including vehicles) will in theaggregate amount only to some  30 million in 1946, and not all of this will beinvestment goods.43. Deliveries of finished machinery (which is what matters from the pointof view of re-equipping industry) will in 1946 be affected by the time-lag betweenincreasing the labour force and completing production of finished equipment.This constitutes one of the reasons why the Board of Trade attach so much importance to a speedy reconversion of the engineering industry to peace-timework.44. Motor vehicles The estimates for commercial and road passenger transport vehicles are requirements by the Ministry of War Transport; the figuregiven for the purchase of new private cars for business use represents the Ministryof Supply&apos;s estimate of the available supply from home sources, assuming thathalf of them ( 48 million valued ex works) will be exported and a small proportionbought for personal use and so included in consumption expenditure.45. Inventories and work in progress The figure given under this headrepresents the change in the value of inventories and work in progress (i.e., includ-ing any increase due to rise in prices) since this is believed to agree with the usualInland Revenue practice in assessing profits to income tax. The size of this, figure is due to the length of the period of industrial gestation; just as the maximuminput of effort in munition manufacture happened some time before the peak of output was achieved, so it must be expected that the output of finished peace-timegoods will not be back to its normal level until the industrial machine has been working at full speed for some months. This lag of output results in a great increase in work in progress during the building-up period. In estimating this figure regard has been had to the fact that in some industries the switch to peace-time production will not result in any net rise in work in progress but only to achange in its composition. Account&apos; has, moreover, been taken of the fact thatthe increase in total stocks and work in progress will not be as great as the increasein privately financed stocks since government realisation of raw materials is;expected to amount to about  65 million.
