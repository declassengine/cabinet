THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET Copy No.CP. (46) 29.28th January, 1946.CABINET.AGRICULTURAL MINIMUM WAGE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.AT the Prime Ministers request, I am circulating herewith, for theinformation of my colleagues in the Cabinet, a copy of a Memorandum on thesubject of the Agricultural Minimum Wage (L.P. (46) 15) which was consideredby the Lord Presidents Committee on the 25th January, 1946* The paper sets out the facts, and the issues involved, in the situation which has arisen as aresult of the decision of the appointed members of the Agricultural Wages board for England and Wales to reject the application by the agricultural workers&apos;unions for an increase in the national minimum wage from 70s. to 90s. per week.2. At the meeting on the 25th January the Lord Presidents Committee,which also had before it a memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (L.P. (46) 19) supporting the views expressed by me in L.P. (46) 15,.reached the following conclusions (LP. (46) 3rd Conclusions) : (1) Endorsed the view of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries that theresponsibility for fixing agricultural wages, in the light of all the relevant conditions, should be left to the independent authorityappointed by Parliament and that he should not seek in any way tointerfere with the recent decision of the Agricultural Wages board to reject the workers&apos; application for an increase in the national minimum wage.(2) Agreed that the decision of the Board did not justify the removal of thelabour controls applicable to agriculture at the present time.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister ofLabour and National Service to give active encouragement to bothsides of the industry to enter into joint discussions with a view tothe formulation of a schedule of wages which would give appropriaterecognition for skill and experience.3. In accordance with these conclusions my Department has now informed the two agricultural workers&apos; unions and the National Farmers&apos; Union that therecan be no question of Government intervention in the matter, but that it is-assumed that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Chairman on behalfof the independent members of the Board, consultations will now take place between the three unions to draw up a system of grading of wage rates whichwould recognise special skill. The unions have been advised that if in the courseof such discussions it is felt that advice or assistance from an officer of the Con-ciliation Department of the Ministry of Labour would be helpful, this couldreadily be provided.J T.

ANNEX.[L.P. (46) 15.]Ilnd January, 1946.CABINET.Lord Presidents Committee.AGRICULTURAL MINIMUM WAGE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I HAVE already informed my colleagues in the Cabinet (CM. (46) 2nd Con-clusions) of the- decision of the appointed members of the Agricultural wages board for England and Wales to reject the application by the agricultural workers&apos; unions for an increase in the national minimum wage from 70s. to 90s.per week. As I anticipated, strong resentment is being expressed by the workers&apos;unions, whose representatives have sought interviews with both the Ministerof Labour and myself to press for some form of Government intervention. Thematter is attracting a considerable amount of attention some of its malicious -in the press, and it is obvious that, when Parliament meets, the views of theworkers&apos; organisations will be strongly pressed on the Government. I feel itdesirable, therefore, to set out for the information of my colleagues the facts of the situation and the issues which are involved.2. The Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales is a body con-sisting of equal numbers (eight) of representatives of farmers and workers,together with five independent members (including the Chairman) appointed bythe Minister of Agriculture. It was set up under the Agricultural Wages(Regulation) Act, 1924, and its powers have been extended by subsequent enact-ments in 1940 and 1942. A brief history of the development of agricultural wages regulation in England and Wales is given in the Appendix to thisMemorandum.3. The suggestions that have been made to me (and, I understand, to theMinister of Labour) by the agricultural workers&apos; representatives may be sum-marised in this way (i) that the Agricultural Wages Board have not given full weight to the.  representations made to them on behalf of the workers;(ii) that the Board have been unduly influenced by the fact that any decisionto increase the minimum wage in agriculture would impose a large additional liability upon the Exchequer: and(iii) that, failing any further increase in wages, labour controls should beremoved from agriculture; or alternatively that the continuation oflabour controls justifies a further increase in wages.4. Suggestion (i) calls in question the competence and impartiality of theBoard. The&quot;&apos;&apos; terms of reference&quot; of the Board are contained in the Acts of1924 and 1940. The Act of 1924. in conferring wage-fixing powers on county committees, provided that &quot;a committee shall, so far as practicable, secure for able-bodied men suchwages as in the opinion of the committee are adequate to promote effieiencyand to enable a man in an ordinary case to maintain himself and his familyin accordance with such standard of comfort as may be reasonable in relationto the nature of his occupation.&quot;The Act of 1940, in placing on the Agricultural Wages Board the duty of fixing a national minimum wage, provided that it should do so &quot; after consultation with the Agricultural Wages Committees and after con-sidermg general economic conditions and the conditions of the agricultural industry.&quot;(The Defence Regulation of 1942 makes no new specification of the factors whichthe Board shall take into account, but leaves the Board with the guidance givenby the Acts of 1924 and 1940.)
5. The claim for an increase in the minimum wage to 90s. per week,presented to the Board by the agricultural workers&apos; unions in December 1945,was opposed by the farmers&apos; representatives. The decision therefore devolvedon the appointed members, whose views are shown in the following shortenedparaphrase of the statement made by the Chairman on the 2nd January, 1946 :  There had been no such change in the situation as would justify a further increase to 90s., either on the ground of the capacity of the industry tobear it, or of any change&apos;in the cost of living or in relation to movements in wage rates in other comparable industries. The cost of the increase wouldbe of the order of  50 million per annum. This could not be met withoutvery considerable increases in the prices paid to farmers. The Governmentcould give no assurance that increases in wages would be automaticallycompensated by increases in prices. If the increase in wages were grantedwithout an increase in prices, food production would be reduced. On theother hand, if prices were increased and the cost of living held accordingto the Governments expressed intentions, the food subsidies would have tobe increased. The appointed members could not take the responsibility of imposing on the Government the liability of finding an additional  50 million from taxation, and accordingly felt obliged to vote against the proposed increase of wages to 90s.The appointed members considered whether a lesser increase than  laweek proposed could be justified. The view they took was that there was acase for improving the recognition of special skill and responsibility on the farms, rather than for raising the minimum wage. The minimum wage, they said, should not be regarded as a standard wage. A system of gradingshould be adopted which would recognise special skill and also give oppor-tunity for advancement as experience increases. The organisations ofemployers and workers were therefore strongly recommended to consult together to draw up a scheme of grading on the lines suggested.The appointed members agreed to support increases in the wage ratefor women workers, who received no increase in 1945 when the rate formale workers was raised to 70s. No increase was recommended for juveniles.The appointed members also agreed to support an increase in overtime ratesand a reduction to 48, all the year round, of the hours in respect of the weeklyminimum.6. This statement by the Chairman of the Board shows that, in the opinionof the impartial members, the claim for an increased minimum wage has not beenmade out on merits. I have made it plain to the workers&apos; representatives that theresponsibility for adjudicating upon claims rests entirely with the Board andthat I have no power to review their findings or to intervene in any way. The&quot; lead &quot; given to the Board in 1940 by the then Government (see paragraph 4 of appendix), which has been quoted by the workers&apos; leaders as a precedent, tookplace in quite exceptional circumstances. There were then impending develop-ments (namely, the proposed imposition of controls on agricultural labour) whichthe Government considered should be taken into account by the Board before reaching a decision. There are no such impending developments at the presenttime.7. As regards suggestion (ii), I feel that one paragraph of the statement made by the Chairman at the last meeting of the Board may have given theimpression that the impartial members were unwilling to accept the responsibilityfor a decision in favour of the workers&apos; claim because that would involve theExchequer in higher costs. In point of fact, however, the Chairman&apos;s statement as a whole does not bear out that interpretation, though naturally the cost of proposals is one item that the Board must consider. The impartial element onthe Board accepted part of the workers&apos; claim (increased women&apos;s rate, increasedovertime rates and reduced hours) and it is estimated that these awards will costat least  7 million in England and Wales, the whole or a part of which may haveto be borne by the Exchequer. The Chairman also urged the two sides of theindustry to confer together and to make joint suggestions for a scheme of grading of agricultural workers according to skill and experience; and has undertakenthat, if agreement can be reached on a workable scheme, the impartial members will co-operate in making the necessary orders so that the special rates may becomeenforceable. It is obvious that a scheme of this kind for granting higher rates of pay to categories of workers is likely to involve the Government in additional[31224]      . b 2
expense;  but the Board did not on that account refrain from making their suggestions.8. There are implications in this suggestion which raise grave issues o**which my colleagues should be aware. The Government have undertaken (in thestatement on agricultural policy which, with the approval of the Cabinet, I madein the House of Commons on the 15th November) to establish as an essential and permanent feature of their policy for food and agriculture a system of assuredmarkets and guaranteed prices for the principal agricultural products, with aview to the provision of tadequate remuneration and decent living conditions forfarmers and workers, with a reasonable return on capital invested. I have been pressed by Labour Members of Parliament to define more precisely what is meantby &quot;adequate remuneration and decent living conditions&quot; in their applicationto the worker. Obviously any attempt at more precise definition, whether in termsof farmers&apos; incomes, workers&apos; wages or landowners&apos; returns, would land theGovernment in the most serious difficulties. So far as wages are concerned it isessential, in my view, to rely on the Agricultural Wages Board carrying out theduties with which they are charged by Parliament, in the light of their statutoryinstructions (see paragraph 4 above). If we express views on the adequacy orinadequacy of their awards, and so take a measure of responsibility for fixingwages and &quot; standards of comfort &quot; for agricultural workers or alternativelyif we announce in advance that prices will-be raised to provide a higher standardof comfort for workers, farmers and landowners, or any one of these sections we shall be led inescapably into the dilemma from which the late Governmentonly extricated itself with great difficulty, namely, the acceptance of a directrelationship between wages and prices, with automatic adjustments of prices to compensate for any increase in wages costs, and consequential increases in thecalls on the Exchequer and the taxpayer. We have so far refused to commit ourselves to any such automatic adjustments, although, of course, it is recognisedthat wages costs are taken into account, together with a number of other factors, atthe annual February review of prices. The special responsibility of the State for fixing agricultural prices imposes on us a need for the utmost caution in dealingwith this problem, and the only safe course in my view is to maintain the general position that the Government intend to establish conditions in the industry whichwill secure the objectives stated in the policy announcement of the 15th November,and to leave the responsibility for wage fixing in the light of all the relevantconditions to the independent authority appointed by Parliament.9. Suggestion (iii) raises issues which are very largely the concern of theMinister oi: Labour, but the policy of the Government with regard to labour controls was announced in the House of Commons on the 13th December, andwhether or not they thought it right to take that into account and to give anyspecial weight to it (especially in view of the wage increase given when controlswore first imposed) it must have been known to the independent members of theBoard when they reached their decision.10, The special features of the problem to which I would draw attentionhre these : (i) For 20 years I have been one of those who have fought in parliament on behalf of the Labour Party and of the Agricultural Workers&quot;Unions for the system of regulation of agricultural wages on a national basis by an independent statutory authority. This battle has now beenwon, but the results would be thrown away if the competence of theBoard were to be called in question by Government intervention inany shape or form.(ii) On the general question of Government intervention, I would remind mycolleagues that, in reply to a Question in the House of Commons onthe 13th December, the Minister of Labour said &quot; There is no intention of departing from the existing policyof entrusting the responsibility for wage regulation to the traditional and well-tried system&apos;of joint voluntary negotiation.&quot;The effect of Government intervention could only be to transfer responsibility for agricultural minimum wages from the Board to theGovernment; and 1 would point out that, if the Government were toaccept this responsibility, and were at the same time anxious tomaintain some particular relationship between agricultural wages and
wages in other industries, we should be obliged also to accept responsi--        166bility for wage levels in those industries, too.   The evidence of the last few years shows that any increase in agricultural wage levels isfollowed   by   applications   for   increases   in   other   comparableemployments.(iii) The award of the Agricultural Wiages Board relates to the agriculturalminimum wage. The 70s. minimum will relate to a week of about48 hours; many workers are entitled to higher minima due to longerhours, or receive higher rates than the law requires; and the majorityreceive overtime pay or bonuses.11. While, however, resisting the suggestion of intervention I must remindmy colleagues that looking to the future the subject of labour supply for agriculture is one that gives me grave concern. A high level of food production from our own soil will continue to be a matter of paramount importance. Forthe present, with the help of auxiliary sources and of labour controls, we may hope, given average agricultural conditions, to maintain production at the desiredlevel. But as temporary measures disappear, agriculture must depend on itsattractiveness relative to other occupations.12. To a considerable extent this will depend on a general improvement in conditions in rural areas, particularly in housing. The Minister of Health, i know, agrees with me that it is necessary to give urgent and special attentionto the rural housing problem if we are to attract workers to the land, and indeedkeep those that are already there. But my immediate concern is the wagesproblem, and in view of the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph  am of opinion, and the Minister of Labour agrees with me, that it is very desirable that the Workers&apos; and Farmers&apos; Unions should adopt the suggestion made by the independent members for the negotiation of a schedule of wagesgiving appropriate recognition for skill and experience. The only positivecontribution which in my view the Government can make towards the solution ofthis wages problem would be to show an interest in this suggestion of theIndependent Members and to offer the services of a member of the ConciliationDepartment of the Ministry of Labour if advice or assistance should be required &apos;during the discussions. Even this modest gesture, however, would carry with itsome implication that the Government would be willing to adjust prices upwardsto compensate farmers for any increased costs incurred as a result of anagreement on wage rates.13. I ask for the endorsement of my colleagues to the views expressed inthis Memorandum and for guidance on the question raised in the preceding paragraph.T. W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1946.Appendix.Agricultural Wages Regulation in England and Wales.1. 1917-23. Statutory agricultural wages regulation in England andWales began with the Corn Production Act, 1917, which established a centralWages Board and District Wages Committees. The Board was empowered to fixminimum wage rates after consultation with the District Committees. Whenthe provisions of the Corn Production Act in regard to guaranteed minimum prices for cereals were repealed in 1921, the wages provisions of the Act wererepealed also. Conciliation machinery was set up instead, but it did not functionsatisfactorily and by the end of 1923 wages tigreements were operative only in afew areas. The average weekly minimum wage had fallen from 46s. in 1921-to 25s.2. Agricidtural Wages (Regidation) Act, 1924. The Labour Governmentin 1924 sought to restore statutory wage regulation and to confer the main powerson a central Board. The political situation made it necessary to accept a compromise and, as passed into law, the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act
of 1924 established county agricultural wages committees, consisting of repre-sentative and appointed members, which had power to fix minimum wage rates.A central Wages Board was also set up, but its powers were practically confined to the issue of formal Orders giving legal effect to the decisions of county com-mittees. Between 1923 and 1939 the average weekly minimum wage rose from25s. to 34s. M.3. Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1940. Soon after the outbreak ofwar in 1939, the agricultural workers&apos; organisations took the initiative in pro-posing a return to the system of central wages regulation which had obtained in the 1914-18 war and which they had hoped to secure in 1924. Their groundswere that farmers&apos; prices were being fixed nationally and that they could reason-ably claim the same kind of security; that existing anomalies between districtswould be more easily removed; that wage settlement would be more speedy; andthat central regulation was more in accord with general industrial practice. Anumber of objections were raised by the farmers. The Act passed early in 1940was a compromise. The existing machinery of county committees was retained,but the central Board was given power to fix (after consultation with the county committees) a national minimum wage rate for adult male workers, which wouldprovide a datum line for the county committees in fixing their minimum wage rates.4. The Wage Settlement of 1940. At the time of the passing of the 1940Act, the average minimum wage level in the counties had reached 38s. When thenational minimum wage was first considered by the Agricultural Wages Board,the appointed members proposed 42s. per week. At that same moment (theNational Government having just come into office) the question of labour controlarcse. At a result of discussion between Ministers, it was decided that, as acondition of agricultural workers being &quot;tied&quot; to the industry, the minimum wage ought to be raised to the 48s. level.&apos; An intimation to this effect wasconveyed informally to the Chairman of the Board; and the National Farmers&apos;Union were notified that prices would be adjusted to meet the additional cost.The figure of 48s. was adopted by the Board in June, 1940. The minimum wage was raised to 60s. in December, 1941.5. Defence (Agriculture and Fisheries) Regulation 23 (1942). Certainanomalies persisted under the Act of 1940. With local minimum wage fixing,even on the basis of a national minimum wage, there were unj ustifiable differences between districts, especially in the rates for women and juveniles. Moreover,there was a danger that county committees might fix rates much above the national minimum (which farmers would be compelled to pay) and that this might createundue pressure on the Government to raise the prices of agricultural produce. Tomeet these points, a Defence Regulation was made vesting in the central Agricul-tural Wages Board the powers of county committees to fix minimum wages solong as agricultural prices were fixed&apos; nationally and a market was assured foragricultural produce. This Regulation was made in November 1942. Since then the minimum wage has been raised, first to 65s. and later (in March, 1945) to 70s.
