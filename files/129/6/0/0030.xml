3 .o/* &apos; -    168(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYrSGOVEMMENT)SECRETCP, (46) 5050th January. 1946, COPY ; 10,, 3 CABINETTHE INDIAN FOOD situation memorandum by the Secretary oT State for IndiaThere has been a further grave deterioration in India&apos;sfood position owing to widespread failure of crops as aresult of the continued lack&quot; oi the normal winter rains inmost of the Provinces.   Hitherto the Government of india have asked for imports of food grains (wheat and rice) in1946 of Vk million tons.     Since this figure was calculated,looses were reported up to December of 10/ million tonsof cereals, offset by an improvement of 1 million tons in bengal.     A further deterioration of another 1.3 million tons has now been reported, involving a net overalldeterioration of 2 million tons since the Government ofIndia estimated their import requirement.     The Governmentof India have accordingly now asked for an additional500,000 tons of imports making a total requirement of2 million tons in 1946.   If the drought, continues even this figure may be inadequate,2.     The salient points of the situation are as follows:-Bengal.      The estimated outturn of the main winterrice crop which has just been harvested in Bengal has improved-since last autumn by about 1 million tons, butthere is still a large potential deficit in that Province,This is difficult to calculate at this stage but thefigure of 800,000 tons is now given as the estimated netdeficit in local -supplies as compared with requirements in bengal by the end of 1946.Madras.   It was reported in December that losses of food grains in Madras as a result of the tidal wave on the east coast and the prolonged drought in other districts amountedlo a total, of about 600,000 tons of rice and 200,000 tonsof millets.     The drought has -continued and latest reportsolace the Madras losses at about 870,000 tons of rice andover 700,000 tons of millets.Bombay and Mysore.   The losses of over 400,0^0 tons offood grains in Bombay (mostly millets) reported in Decemberhas now risen to about 500,000 tons, while in Mysore the december figure of &apos; 100,000 tons is now put at 200,000 tonsof rice and millets.     These disastrous losses in WesternIndia are also attributable to the prolonged drought,Punjab/

Punjab.   The procurement situation in the Punjab hasbeen very unsatisfactory for some months and it is now expected that the Punjab will fall short of its exportguota of 700,000 tons during the present wheat year byabout 250,000 tons.     The new crop has also suffered fromdrought and, though the damage cannot yet be assessedprecisely, it may amount to as much as k million tons.3.     Imports of food grains into India during the last fewyears have never been sufficient to unable the Governmentto build up the working stocks which they have alwaysregarded as essential to make their position tolerablysecureo     As a, result the Indian Food Department now find themselves without the   minimum stocks which they urgentlyrequire in order to prevent the occurrence of shortages,maintain confidence,&quot;stimulate their own internalprocurement (which is particularly difficult at present inthe Punjab where Government purchases of wheat have beenbrought to a standstill) and meet the greatly increased demands which are   being made upon t hem by their deficitareas.      Only an acceleration of imports from abroadcan enable the Government of India during the coming months to feed the cities and prevent not merely local foodshortages, but widespread starvation,tion0      It is fearedindeed that unless immediate action is taken there may bea breakdown of the whole structure of procurement and rationing which the Government   of India have built up solaboriously over the last three years.     This must inevitably endanger the stability of the administration.4.     Against this background the position in regard toforeign imports is as follows(a) V/heats   H.M.G. have been loading wheat for India from north America at the rate of 100,000 tons a month duringthe   last six months of 1945.     Over 200,000 tons of thiswheat will be arriving in India during the months of january and February this year.,     In addition India has been allocated 400,000 tons of wheat for the first six monthsof this year under the arrangements recently agreed with,the United States Government during the Minister of Food&apos;visit to Washington.      In view of the huge deficit in world wheat supplies during the first half of this year i recognise that&quot; this represents a considerable achievement,but it will not be enough&apos;to enable the Government of Indiato overcome their difficulties   in the near future unlessfurther substantial assistance can&apos;be given.     The Ministryof Food have given an assurance that every effort will bemade to load as much as possible of this wheat from north america or Australia so as to arrive in India before theend of April as the. Government of India have requested, butas yet they have not been able to hold out any hope thatloadings can be increased above the present figure of100,000 tons a month.     The Government of India particularlyrequested a month ago that an additional 50,000 tons amonth should be loaded in each, of the three months January/March, but hitherto it has not been possible to satisfythis request.(b) Rice/

(b) Rice.    The revised allocations of the combined food Board for the last quarter of L945 and the i&quot;intensification,quarter of 1946 as recently agreed In Wosllingtori onlygive India 74,000 tons or rice.     It Is believed thai,amount has now actually I), set 1. ;::I ri.ppiid I..(i 11 ui i;i. i&apos;hmi Buim;i,,but it is hardly sufficient to cover more than the harerepayment of India&apos;s loans to Ceylon and Burma, which amounted to 66,000 tons.    Priority has recently beengiven to meeting S.A.-G.S.E.A.&apos;s claims Cor the minimum requirements for the prevention of famine in 8;E.A.&apos;G. andthe bulk of such rice as has been available has been allocated to SeE.A.C. territories (viz. the netherlands east Indies, Borneo, Hong Kong and Malaya).     I r the full extent of the deterioration in India&apos;s position had been realised when these allocations were arranged in i/ashingtonl feel that H.M.G.* s decision to press for priority for s.E.AoC.&apos;s requirements would have had lo be modified.5.    The Government of India have examined the possibilityof a reduction of ration scales all over India.    Certainreductions are being made, but there is little room for effecting much saving in this direction.     The actualoff-take of rationed cereals in India is at present under60a. of the potential total on a ner Capita basis, owing tothe fact that the poorer section of the rationed populationdo not consume the whole ration because of the high pricesof food grains.      It is felt that any attempt to r-educethe ration substantially on an all-India basis would createpanic, thus causing the off-take to increase and seriouslyaggravating procurement difficulties.      I should emphasisein this connection that,although the calory value of the cereal ration in india is 16CC calories a day, the averagenorm

7.     I think that the situation calls for action on thefollowing lines;(a) His Majesty1s Government should continue to make every effort to accelerate shipment to India of the4C0.000 tons of wheat already allotecl to India under thearrangements recently agreed with the United StatesGovernment, so that as much as possible of f his wheat may-arrive in India before the end of April,   Steps should betaken to ensure that supplies are not held up by shortgeof shipping.(b) The wheat exporting countries should be invited toincrease their flour extraction rates to 80&quot;: at theearliest practicable moment, thereby releasing more wheat for export (as suggested in recommendation (dT(i) inparagraph 19 of the Minister of Food&apos;s memorandum&quot;CP. (46)26), cane a substantial share of any additional supplies that may &quot;be made available in the first sixmonths of this year should be alloted to India, With aview to encouraging this I should support action asproposed by the,Minister of Food in paragraph 19of CP. (46)26 to raise the extraction rate in thiscountry.(c) H.M.G. should endeavour to secure a largerallotment to India of the world supplies of wheatavailable during, the second half of 1946.(d) As soon as availabilities of rice during the second quarter of 1946 can be estimated consideration should begiven to India&apos;s special claims to receive a largeallocation of rice during this period.(e) H.M.G. should welcome the proposed visit ofthe Indian Food Member&apos;s delegation to London and give the delegation every possible assistance in their task of presenting India1s case in Washington.P.-Li,India Office,30th January, 1946.
