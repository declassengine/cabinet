J2g I ^ f&amp;u^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PEROPEHTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. p. (Ll6) 2527TH JANUARY,   1 9U6CABINET&quot;STRIKES&quot;  IN THE R.A.p.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for AirI think the Cabinet would wish to have some information regarding the so-called &quot;strikes&quot; in the R.A.P.2.      The trouble showed itself first at Mauripur (near Karachi)on 22nd January, when a large number of airmen stopped workand refused to return to duty although addressed by theOfficer in Command,  together with the Inspector-General,R.A.F., who was passing through the Station.    Similarincidents have occurred elsewhere in India,  Ceylon and theMiddle East.    At Mauripur and several other Stations it isnow reported that work has been resumed..3.      The grievances expressed in all cases are a mixture ofgeneral complaints based primarily on a demand for quickerdemobilisation and repatriation, but complicated withcriticisms of particular points in the administration ofthe scheme.    These criticisms largely rest on misunderstanding of what,  in fact,  is being done.    A fairly common symptonyhowever,  now appears to be that the men express themselves as not dissatisfied with the Service or with the administrationby the Service authorities of the  scheme, but are severelycritical of Government policy itself.k.      To deal with the particular complaints,  further&quot;Demobforms&quot; have been issued..   I should explain1 that the&quot;Demobform&quot; is a message from the Air Ministry sent to allStations in simple language for the information of allconcerned on how demobilisation works.    Commanding officers are told that it is their responsibility to see that all ranks on the Stations are fully aware of the contents ofthe &quot;Demobform&quot;,  and in many cases, when they have thought itnecessary,  they have themselves explained the forms to - the menand an swe red que st i on s.5. I attach a copy of the &quot;Demobform&quot; issued last Thursdaywhich shows the general policy of the Air Council in dealingwith these incidents.-    14&quot;b^V&quot; /copy no.

-    145b.      Commander s-in-Chief abroad have been told that, whilethoy have entire discretion to deal with the situation asthey think best, they will have  the support of the AirMinistry if they take the following line:-(a) The men should be informed that the fullestinvestigation is now talcing place, but that discussion with them of the merits of the casewill not bo resumed until full normal work is resumed.(b) The action of the. ring-leaders should not becondoned and disciplinary action tele en as appropriate.-7.      The Air Marshal Commanding, B. A. P. S. IS. A. , has asked that a general statement of Government policy should be madeas,  in his opinion,  the most effective way of preventingfurther incidents.    I do not myself sec how any such statement could go beyond the information already provided so freelyin the &quot;Demobforms&quot;.    It may be  crue that we shall,  as aresult of the recent requests of the Defence Committee,accelerate release considerably,   but we ere certainly not ina position to make any precise statement;    indeed a drasticacceleration in the rate of release .may leave some of themen concerned with a still greater sense of grievance if,in fact,   we find ourselves obliged to depart from the BevinScheme.    It will,  however, be important that any accelerationwhich is announced in the ordinary way in the near futureshould not be made to appear as a concession to indiscipline.8.      I do not at are sent expect the trouble to spreadseriously,   although further incidents arc probable.    Thereare,  however,   strong indications that this is an organisedmovement.    I think,  therefore; that my colleagues should be aware of the position.Air Ministry,  S.W.1.27TH JANUARY,   19h7.-2-

&apos;    POST A G H A M .R.A. P. Form 1 92k. Originator&apos;s Reference NumberDemobf orm No. 31.To: All R.A..F. Commands, - Date:- 20th January,  19h7.Croups and Units atHome and OverseasFrom: Air Ministry, KingswayDemobform 3i.1. Commanding Officers are personally responsible that thefollowing is made known immediately to all ranks under theircommand.2.      For the third time in two days airmen at overseas stationshave staged a so-called &quot;strike&quot; on account of grievances realor imaginary about the rate of demobilisation.3.     - It should be made clear to all ranks that this sort ofbehaviour is a gross breach of discipline which brings seriousdiscredit upon the R.A.F.k.      The factors which determine the conditions and rate of release in the R.A.F.  and the other Services are explained fromtime to time in DSMOBFORMS.    Never before has the Service beentaken so fully and frankly into oho confidence of the AirMinistry as at present.    The Demobilisation scheme is anordered process in which the needs of civilian industry,  the commitments of the Services,  the interests of officers end menand. many other factors such as transport at ion, have all to be carefully balanced..    The whole process was fully end simplyexplained in Demob farm 1 k.5.      It was obvious from the complaints submitted at one- of the stations concerned that many are still ignorant of simple factsabout demobilisation which have been clearly set out inDemobforms.    For instance one complaint was that the R.A.F.are being treated unfairly by being released more slowly thanthe other Services.    In actual fact the R. A. F.   is well abreastof the Army and Navy in its rate of release and this situation will bo maintained.6.      The point is that these complaints should not arise ifofficers and men know what is going on,  and why,  end it isclear that proper use is still not being made of the informationconstantly sent out from the Air Ministry in Demobforms.    the primary responsibility of course rests with the officers whose duty it is(a) to see that their men know the facts and(b) to know the feeling among their men and ensurethat legitimate grievances are brought at oncethrough the proper channels to the notice&apos;of theappropriate higher -authority who is in a positionto do&quot; something about them.But all ranks must clearly understand that there is a properrecognised method oj, representing grievances and that seriousbreaches of discipline &quot;such as those which have done harm tothe cjooa nemo of the R. A.F.  in the past few days have the strongest disapproval of H.M.  Government and will not be tolerated.ciginator&apos;s     j,;^  SLEgSop Time of Origin   21.00 hoursSignature Mr ohief marshal air Member for Personnel.-3-
