/196(THIS LI)OuTJEHT. IS THE PROPERTY OF HIGOVERNMENT)BRITANNIC HAJESTY1SRET(46) 55COPY NO. 3%50th January, 1946C A B I N E IWORLDSITUATIONmemorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.With reference to paragraph 6 of the Minister of Food&apos;sMemorandum CP. (46)28 of the 29th January, I circulate, for theinformation of my colleagues, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith&apos;s replyto the request that he should authorise the export from Burmaof 400,000 tons of rice during the first quarter of 1946.2,     I hope my colleagues will agree that, in the circumstances described, the Governor could not be expected to meet this request.     He is however prepared to produce a further 55,000tons of rice for export on certain conditions and does not closthe door to a further contribution.     It is clear that he isdoing his utmost against great difficulties and fully recognisethat it is to the interest of Burma to step up production anaexport the greatest possible quantity of rice.     As regards theconditions which the Governor attaches to his present offer of55,000 tons in the near future, I ask my colleagues to endorse the second, namely, that everything possible should be done tomeet Burma&apos;s urgent requirements in road and&apos;river transportMia consumer goods;   the need for this provision in theinterests of everyone interested in Burma&apos;s export capacity isobvious.     As regards the .first. condition, namely the guaranteof replacement of rice exported from Burma in the first half ofdie year, I should mention thai 20,000 tons of rice and 10,000tons of broken rice have already been exported from Burma withocondition being attached.     I see no reason to guarantee the replacement of these quantities.     The Governor is offeringIto export 25,000 tons from Bassein as soon as arrangements?an be made to move it in order to relieve congestion there:in doing so, he is taking certain risks of later shortage,put this Is a measure that he is taking primarily in Burma&apos;interests * and here again I see no reason why a guaranteePf replacement should be given.     But, as regards the 50,000tons now offered for export in the near future from Rangoon,would ask my colleagues to guarantee that, to the extentft. it being found necessary in the second half of the yearpo replace quantities exported in the first half, Burma-lould have an absolute priority in her demands on Siameserice/

rice to the extent of this 30,000 tons.     I would not ask for a&apos; similar guarantee in regard to any subsequentamounts that it may be found possible to export duringthe first quarter,&apos;but prefer&quot;to&apos;reserve my&quot;position until more accurate forecasts&apos;of the out-turn of the recentcrop are available,3.     I should add that the transport question has alreadybeen taken up urgently with the departments concerned andthat they have been very helpful.     As regards consumer goods, the Governor&apos;s telegram further emphasises their importance from the point of view of the rice crop , andi would propose, if my colleagues agree, to inform him that this is fully appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government,and that we will do all in our power to help.P-IBurma Office.30th January, 1946

January, &apos; Rice Exportsvis it thought that we have unlimited stocks, of ricein storage or that we can move what we have at. will.    Burmahas never had storage Capacity on large scale (the &quot;policy hasalways been to mill for early disposal) and our position hascertainly not been improved by years of war and.military occupation, - The main lines of our railways are only workingvery shakily, and most of the branch line?? not at all.    Ourriver fleet has been destroyed and not replaced.    Have the americans also forgotten that they have themselves beenbombing &apos;and machine gunning our country craft for years inspite of our misgivings,     . . .   - -2,   .  Our total effective milling capacity in lower Burma doesnot exceed 4,000 tons a day.    The country eats almost. 7,000tons a day-.&quot;  it- is only because such a large proportion office consumed in rural - ureas (vis) hand-pounded that we can keep, going at all-    Even so, needs of the urban population are about 670 tons a day and- all rice which is not consumed whereit 1b j^csffii has to be rallied,.    It will certainly riot be unduly cautious to say that less than half of presentmilling capacity could be used for export purposes.-    Ourmilled&apos;stocks en January 1.5th were&apos; 120*000 tons,    Duringremaining 75 days to - end of March we get a-possible 150*000tons which could be milled for export..    The arithmetic issimple.    Fe have not got 400000 tons,      Even if we had we could not move it to the ports.Almost all rice for export has to be lifted at leastP.T. 0

The. reference to Basse in brings me to the offerI can. make immediately.&quot;   Basse-in is a &quot;bottleneck and now thatthe railway is gone the only effective way of moving rice out.rapidly is by sea-    The mills there are congested;,, the old cropis not yet fully milled and . the new crop is ready.    Unless wecan clear the mills we shall hold up movement of the new cropwhich will have very -serious consequences*   We are ready to export 25.^000 tons from Basse in as soon as it can he taken- away.-/This, offer arises from a position which has arisen since mylast&apos; review of the situation.,    1 should, have made it in any event,   it is not squeezed out by threats of reprisals or &quot;by&apos;the impossible demands of Washington,   It derives merely fromthe feet , - ....

This net made necessary bycongestion there but is a result of the careful and constant review of the situation which I previously premised and is madeon the strict understanding that the promise to replace this and.any&apos; other amounts from Siam later in the year will be implemented,6.    . This promise brings a now factor into our consideration ofthe situation though T am bound to say that we do not find theoffer attractive..    Siamese rice is the- wrong type for localconsumption in Burma and it is inevitable a*-er. if it were not.fair that the preferences of a producing country must he: takeninto account.    It would he ashing rather a lot of ua that while-the Ministry of Food is prepared to take into account localprejudice in distressed areas against, lohaein which is considerably more nutritive than white rice our localpreferences should be. disregarded.   Moreover as we -understand itthe.. Siamese&apos; surplus, is the accumulation- of severe! (tyears) andit seems probable that, as tar as any exports from, our now- cropare concerned we shall probably be getting bad rice for. good,.We are also unaware of the degree of accuracy to be attached tothe Ministry, of Fbafi&apos; a estimate of this surplus which must havebeen very hurriedly prepared-.   Prom our own experience and purknowledge of conditions in. this part of the world s?e are morethan a little sceptical.    nevertheless&apos; the promise doesintroduce a new footer to which we shall give every considerableI should however like oon.fi mat ion of my interpretation1 that the promise amounts to giving Burma an. absolute priority in herdemands oh Siamese r-ioe during the second half of 1946 up tothe amount exported by her in the first half of the year.Unless this is right the promise will not help me very muchand until 1 have confirmation i cannot go further than atpresent especially as car latest rice forecast gives a decreaseof some ( 300,000 ) tons of paddy en the previous estimate.    I.should also appreciate your definite assurance that everything possible is being done Co meet our requirements in transport-especially LWPfO and consumer goods,For the rest I can only assure you that I am keeping thewhole matter of rice exports under&quot; constant review and that thesituation is still-, fluid.    I. have acme of my best officers onthis and none of them is of the timid type.    Although ourlatest news of the crop is discouraging there is some reason tobelieve tna&quot;c there may bo mere old. paddy than we thought in theDeita ana this is being investigated -- under very considerable difficulties.    I understand that the possibility of evolving asystem which-.will give us bettor knowledge of where 3 ocallypurchased rice goes after it leaves the null is being investigated and if a practical scheme can. he&apos; worked out thiswill help us greatly,.    1 hope that we may be able to make further additions -co our exports later but can raalte no premiseyet.
