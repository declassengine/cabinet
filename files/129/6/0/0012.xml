THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTOffice of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,Dear Secretary of State, Pretoria, 11th December, 1945.YOU very kindly showed interest in the contents of my letter of the22nd August giving you a general review of South African affairs. next month the first post-war session of the Union Parliament will start. It willprobably be long and much important and contentious business will certainly bediscussed. I thought, therefore, that something to fill in the gaps in my previousaccount and to describe changes which have occurred since it was written mightbe of use to you.2. The coalition has broken up. Though both the Labour and Dominionparties are now in opposition, the Government retains the comparatively com-comfortable majority of 23 in a House of 153. But the future has becomeuncertain. The life of the present Parliament expires in January 1949, fiveyears after the opening date of its first session. General Smuts has announcedthat he has no intention at present of giving up the leadership of the country.He appears to be in robust health and walks most evenings 9 miles from theUnion Buildings to his farm at Irene. He has reshuffled portfolios, broughtinto the Cabinet a Cape industrialist and a doctor Member of Parliament wellknown as the author of a widely read and as widely approved health reportcontaining drastic recommendations to extend and simplify health services.There will be a new delimitation of seats by a Commission of judges before 1949.The total number must remain the same unless the Constitution is altered at asitting of both Houses, but the Witwatersrand is almost sure to gain seats atthe expense of other areas and so become more than ever the political key tothe country. It is most unlikely that a general election will take place beforethe delimitation is complete.3. Three possible political developments likely to affect the elections are often mentioned: (1) The formation by a group of United Party members and by another group of Nationalist members of a new Centre Party (paragraph 8 of myletter of the 22nd August). Little more has been heard of *his. I regard with suspicion most stories of a serious split in the Nationalistranks.(2) The replacement of Mr. Hofmeyr in the position of heir apparent or,alternatively, his overthrow after he has succeeded General Smuts.An anti-Hofmeyr intrigue is undoubtedly being fomented within the ranks of the United Party. How strong it is I do not know; but itseems that General Smuts will lead the party for several more years.(3) An alliance between the Nationalists and the Labour Party.[31148] b49SECRET. Copy No.    cp. (46) 12.10th January, 1946.CABINET.POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY colleagues may like to read the annexed copy of a further personal letter from Sir Evelyn Baring, United Kingdom High Commissioner in theUnion of South Africa, giving a general review of South African affairs incontinuation of his letter of the 22nd August, of which I circulated a copy, to theCabinet on the 18th September (CP. (45) 179).A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,10th January, 1946.
4. Should this last take place it would be a development of first-rateimportance. A Nationalist-Labour alliance would probably sweep theWitwatersrand, the great mining and industrial centre of South Africa, andother industrial towns in the Transvaal such as Vereeniging, the home of muchheavy industry. Not only would the alliance be important but it would also bea repetition of the past. In 1924 General Hertzog came to power following theformation of a Labour-Nationalist Pact; and the &quot;Pact&quot; Government won asecond sweeping victory at the polls in 1929.5. Attention has, I think, been concentrated on the possibility of a new&quot; Pact &quot; because of the story of the past and because of the sweeping politicalchanges likely to follow the formation of a political alliance between the nationalists and Labour. Two recent speeches have been taken as straws showingwhich way the wind might blow. Senator Sidney Smith, the recently electedMayor of Durban, said a few months ago that he preferred the Nationalists tothe United Party. Mr. Vandenberg. a vigorous Afrikaans-speaking LabourMember of Parliament, more recently remarked cryptically that he was preparedto join forces with members of any party. On the other hand the Mayor ofDurban proclaimed last week the virtues of a &quot;Buy British&quot; campaign; theNatal Provincial Congress of the Labour Party denounced the idea of a new&apos;&apos; Pact&apos;&apos;; the same denunciation, but in more abusive language, was published in Die Transvaler, an extreme and a widely read Nationalist paper.6. I was in South Africa during the last years of the old &apos;&apos; Pact&apos;&apos;Government. The Nationalists were treating their Labour colleagues, led by colonel Cresswell, with scant consideration. A number of Labour Members ofParliament led by Mr. Madeley (who resigned the portfolio of Labour last month),disgusted with their treatment, had broken away from the Pact. At that timemost members of the Labour Party considered that the Party had been harmedby its association with the Nationalists. South African public men have thememories of elephants and it is unlikely that the experiences of those days havebeen forgotten. At some future date a new Nationalist-Labour &quot; Pact&quot; mightbe formed. But I am inclined to think that, before this happens, first the memoriesof the war must become dimmed and, secondly, Dr. Malan must be removed fromthe leadership of the Nationalist Party.7. Meanwhile a political pointer has been the result of the recent Municipalelections. In South Africa one-third of the members of each Local Authorityretire each year. In Johannesburg there is something like a stalemate. labour are just the largest single party and there is a Labour Mayor. In Pretoria the nationalists were thrown out of office. It was the first municipal election foughtby the United Party as a party. Generally on the Rand the United Party didbetter than was expected, Labour not quite as well, and the Nationalists madegains but still have a long way to go. They have only 5 seats out of 42 inJohannesburg and control completely only one council, that of Brakpan.Indian Affairs.8. In my last letter I wrote of the troubles between the two sections of SouthAfrican Europeans and between black and white. I left out the third problem,that of the Indians.9. If the Indians were spread evenly throughout the Union there would beno serious problem. But the distribution is very uneven. The Free State bannedtheir entry long ago. In the Cape there are few; and those in Cape Town are mainly Muslims and have merged with their Afrikaans-speaking co-religionistswho are the descendants of the Malay slaves brought long ago from theNetherlands East Indies. The mass of South African Indians are confined toNatal, especially Durban and the coast belt, and to the Transvaal towns,especially those of the Witwatersrand.10. They are of two types. First, both in time of arrival and in numbers,are the descendants of the peasants who came usually from Madras, but sometimesfrom North-East India between 1860 and 1911 to work in the sugar cane planta-tions and the coal mines of Natal. Secondly, there are the traders who originallycame to supply the wants of the indentured men and who stayed to trade with south Africans generally.11. During recent years, however, a number of- the first class have becometraders. There has also been a great movement from the country districts ofNatal into the towns, especially into Durban.
12. The Indians were brought to Natal for the white man&apos;s profit. Forsome thirty years from their first arrival they were offered numerous inducementsto stay. They have in fact been the prop of the economic structure of the isolated&quot; garden colony &quot; where in a warm climate Europeans shrink from hard physicalwork. As an agricultural labourer, as a coal miner, as a market gardener, as a semi-skilled worker in a Durban factory, or as a foreman in charge of the Nativesin a cane or a wattle-bark mill in the countryside the Indian has been essentialto Natal. .13. But since the nineties the Europeans have come to fear and to dislikethe Indians.  There are three reasons which may account for this attitude : (1) Trade rivalry since the Indian shopkeeper is more than a match for either the Greek or the Eastern European Jew.(2) Dislike of what General Smuts describes as &quot; residential juxta-position &quot;and the penetration of European residential areas is the great- cryof the Durban anti-Asiatic.(3).Fear that Europeans will be swamped by sheer weight of numbers. an excessive number of Indian men as compared with women came out under indenture. This disproportion between the sexes accounts forthe comparatively slow increase in the total Indian population. Ithas now been wiped out. At present the sex ratio is the same forIndians as for Europeans. The total Indian population now no morethan equals the total European population, but it includes far morepersons under 30 and far fewer over 60, and will probably soonexceed it.14. As a result, immigration was closed in 1911 to all but wives and children of Indians already resident: legislation was promulgated forbidding the enrol-ment of Indians as Parliamentary voters (1896) and as municipal voters (1924);unsuccessful attempts were made to bribe Indians to return to India; in 1943Indians were forbidden by the &quot; Pegging Act&quot; to occupy or to buy new stands in Durban without the approval of the Minister.15. The last few years have seen continual attempts by Europeans to limit(1) the purchase of land by Indians, (2) Indian residence, and (3) Indian occupa-tion of trading premises. During the same period the Durban City Council havecompletely failed to provide housing for Indians. The attitude has been negative.Attempts are made to keep Indians out of certain areas; nothing is done to attract them to other areas.16. General Smuts&apos; view is in brief that there should be legislative sanction for the creation of separate residential areas, but no legislative steps taken toprevent Indians from buying land or occupying stands for purposes other thanresidence. But he is pressed from Natal by the Provincial Council and stillharder by the Durban City Council to go further. Indians suspect that their opponents wish to organise further restriction indirectly by the use of powersof&apos; expropriation given to Local Authorities by housing legislation. A merryrow is now in progress about the Natal Housing Ordinance. Unfortunately the indians have chosen this moment when they are very much in mid-stream to swophorses. They or at least the Durban Indians who control the Natal IndianCongress have thrown out their previous leaders, one of whom really had thePrime Ministers confidence, and they have placed in power a number of quiteinexperienced young men. These are the leaders of the Anti-Segregation Council.They include in their number many members of the Communist party, and allare pledged to a hopeless policy of no compromise. The position of the representa-tive of the Government of India, who in terms of the Cape Town Agreement of1926 looks after the interests of South African Indians, *is in these circumstancesvery difficult.Native Affairs.17. Debates on Native affairs during the coming session should be of interest.For the first time post-war Native policy will be discussed.18. The newspapers and the public generally are discussing a wave of crimeamong Witwatersrand Natives. The discussion has brought to the fore theproblem of the 1,000,000 &quot;urbanised&quot; Natives especially on the Rand and atCape Town. It is clear to anyone of reasonable intelligence that the causes of thewave of crime are to be sought in their conditions of life, in overcrowding, in the[31148] b 2
defiance of the law forbidding the brewing of beer privately and in the lack ofschooling for the children. I was told recently that figures collected by theJohannesburg City Council show that both in the big Municipal location Orlando(where the Council builds houses and rents them to the Natives) and in Sophiatownand New Clare (where plots of land and houses are privately owned and sublet)not more than one child in four is at school.   The rest are on the streets.19. Europeans are becoming frightened. If any improvement is to takeplace two moves above all must. I think, be made. Each will be unpopular witha large section of Europeans.20. One move is to meet the European demand that the Natives should liveapart from the European but work with him. To organise this on the Rand itwould be necessary to build a number of suitable Native townships, to join themto the existing towns where the factories are situated by good roads, and thirdlyto provide cheap transport. Unless opinion on &apos;&apos; residential segregation&apos;&apos;changes it would be necessary to place the new townships well away (perhaps10 miles) from the centre.of Johannesburg. Old townships such as Sophiatowmhave now been swallowed by. the city and have become warrens which should be cleared. But Johannesburg is spreading north. The Native townships might therefore be built to the south and steps taken to control the sale of land nearthem. But these three things sub-economic houses, roads and sub-economictransport would cost the taxpayer much money. Critics could claim with someshow of reason that South Africa&apos;s economic future depends on the developmentof secondary industries, that the cost of production of existing industries is too high, and that a general increase in taxes would cause it to become even higher.But if the (white) man in the street retains his feelings about mixed residentialareas one day he will have to foot the bill.21. The other move concerns the European artisan. At present by a variety of methods the African is kept out of skilled trades. If there is to be peace andquiet there must clearly be some relaxation somewhere now that so many Africansare factory workers living permanently in the towns and are no longer temporaryvisitors from the country. It is difficult to foretell the future of the economiccolour bar. On the one hand regulations have been drafted granting an assurance of work over 10 years to the Europeans now in the building trades and more orless as a quid pro quo providing for the employment of Natives on skilled jobswhen houses for occupation by Natives are being built. These regulations are still being discussed. On the other hand I hear rumours that the attitude of europeans is stiffening because during the war industrial production havingincreased and the supply of European skilled workers being limited, the number ofnon-Europeans in semi-skilled labour has undoubtedly increased and the numberof natives proportionate to Europeans has in many cases increased also. TheEuropean artisan is often accused of being the main obstacle to the organisationof a better way of life for the town Native. He is neither worse nor better than other white South Africans but, his job being more directly threatened, he is moreafraid.22. Here then I suggest are two questions. Will the European taxpayermeet the cost of proper conditions of life for the town Native ? Will the Europeanartisan allow him a reasonable chance to improve his condition?23. At present I think European feeling is in a state of flux. Most people have neither thought deeply about the problem nor made up their minds. Thuson the one hand it is most encouraging to read that the troops in the middle east, given the choice of an object for the expenditure of a large sum in a benefitfund, unanimously chose the improvement of health measures among non-Europeans. The volunteer soldiers and airmen are the pick of the country; andthe majority is Afrikaans-speaking. Their decision confirms the view that asteadily increasing number of the best among South Africans are beginning tothink along more liberal lines. It is greatly to our advantage to encourage these people. Nothing could be worse for race relations throughout Africa than aconflagration in the Union.24. On the other hand I visited recently the offices of the Bantu world in Johannesburg. This is the Native paper with the widest circulation in theUnion. It is one of a number of Native papers owned by the big &quot; Argus group.&quot;The editor is an African but the manager a European. It is studiously moderatein tone; in fact the objective of those who financed it was to produce some alterna-tive to Communist news sheets.  Last year during a riot a mob of 300 Afrikaner
hooligans broke into its old offices and burned them to the ground. The manage-ment have spent  1,000 on- measures of protection for the new offices (steelshutters, &amp;c). After the riot 24 Natives were sent to gaol. No European was arrested for two months and eventually one European received a suspendedsentence. The South African &quot; Liberals &quot; have a long and a hard road to treadand they may make slow progress!25. But meanwhile feeling between Africans and Europeans is rapidlydeteriorating. At the offices of the Bantu World I talked with two leadingAfricans. One was Selope Thema, the editor (a member of the African Repre-sentatives&apos; Council which was instituted by one of Ffertzog&apos;s &quot; Native Acts &quot;in 1936 to sit in Pretoria in a purely advisory capacity). The other wasDr. Xuma, President of the African National Congress. This is probably themain political organ among Union Africans. It includes Communists among its members. But as an organisation it is not affiliated to the Communist Party,nor has it any relations with those organisations of Indians or of Coloured persons whose members are anxious to organise a united anti-European front.26. These two spoke of the increasing bitterness among Africans andespecially among those in the towns. They went on to volunteer very strong opposition to the transfer of the High Commission Territories to Union control.They claimed that on this matter they were voicing the opinions of all educatedAfricans. Indeed I have heard the same views expressed twice before once inDurban by the two leaders of the Natal branch of the African National Congress,one a &quot; moderate &quot; and the other, Champion by name, a well-known stormy petreland leader in the past of many strikes; again at the African University of FortHare by an African Professor named Matthews who is also a member of theNative Representatives&apos; Council.27. Dr. Xuma has spent several years in the United States and his wife is aNegress from North Carolina. He expresses himself very clearly. I asked himwhy he was so opposed to the transfer of the Territories. He said in reply thatthe present Native policy of the Union was wrong; the implementation of that policy was giving rise to racial hatred; the growth of that racial hatred wouldone day lead to violence and possibly to war. If we transferred control of the territories our act would be taken by Africans to imply a tacit acknowledgmentof the soundness of Union Native policy; would strengthen the hand of those whofavour that policy; and would therefore hasten the coming of the day when itsevil consequences will be felt. We should, on the contrary, said Dr. Xuma,attempt to make the three Territories into three islands where Union Europeanscould see that the relations between black and white are better than in the union and where Africans are given a greater share in the Government. He wouldalso like to see the Territories as models of economic development. Following a word of warning from me he said he knew that the United Kingdom could notspend great sums of money now but he did hope that a beginning could be madewith economic development.Yours sincerely,E. BARING.
