THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.-    235SECRET. Copy No.     38CP. (46) 38.1st February, 1946.CABINET.GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.THE position regarding the probable supply of German prisoners of war inthis country this year is now much clearer than when I submitted my Memorandumof the 17th December, 1945 (CP. (45) 341), and it is necessary, without further delay, to decide the basis on which they should be allocated between differentemployments.2. In paragraph 9 of CP. (45) 341, I estimated that, in addition to the197,000 German prisoners already in this country, some 80,000 could be broughthere from Canada and the United States. The result of action taken since theCabinet approved my proposals (CM. (45) 64th Conclusions, Minute 3 (1)) hasbeen to increase this figure by 38;000. Arrangements are in hand to bring andaccommodate here in the next three months (i.e., up to the end of April) 118,000German prisoners. It is estimated by the War Office that 44,000 will come inFebruary; 27,000 in March; and 47.000 in April.3. After April it will not be possible to bring more prisoners from north america. Our sole source of supply will then be the Continent. At least 165,000German prisoners will be available in Germany for transfer to this country ifneeded, and as transport and accommodation permit. This number is a minimum.The Control Commission may be able to make more than the 165,000 prisonersavailable from within Germany itself and negotiations are actively proceedingwhich may make available another 20,000 now in Norway. Any estimatesregarding the probable rate of transfer of these prisoners to this country afterApril are unreliable, but this need not delay the settlement of an allocation policy.4. The repatriation of Italian prisoners continues. The number repatriatedso far is 23,000, leaving 127,000 in this country. Another 19,000 are due to goby the end of February. They go by age-groups, oldest first, and thus the lossis spread evenly between the different User Departments.Allocation of Prisoners of War to different employments.5. Now that we have definite information regarding the intake of prisoners from North America and the availability of prisoners on the Continent, our firsttask is to decide how to allocate these prisoners as they become available for employment on reaching the country. This task can be remitted, as in the past,to the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Employment of Prisoners of War,of which my Department supplies the Chairman and Secretariat. The Com-mittee in carrying, out this task should, be guided by the general consideration that prisoners of war ought to be used on work which is most suitable for them(e.g., for reasons of accommodation) and particularly where their employment willmost effectively mitigate the very serious shortage of man-power capable of undertaking heavy or exacting unskilled work. Subject to this the Committeeshould have regard to any authoritative indications as to the importance ofdifferent jobs. The Committee should, therefore, be expected to give highest priority, among others, to the following demands :  (1) Work which will directly or indirectly further the housing programme.(2) Urgent work in connection with this year&apos;s harvest.(3) The clearance of stores.
6. Demands from Departments for German prisoners to replace Italianswho are withdrawn under the repatriation programme should be dealt with inthe same way as other demands. They should not have any special priority. the test in these cases, as in all others, must be the current urgency and importanceof the work as compared with other demands. Shortage of accommodation inthe right places, coupled with the need to obtain the agreement of the TradeUnions directly concerned, will inevitably, as in the past, restrict the opportunities to employ prisoners.Constitution of the Inter-Departmental Committee.7. I was invited by the Cabinet (see CM. (45) 64th Conclusions. Minute 3(2))to consider whether any alteration in the composition of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee was desirable in order to ensure close working between all the Depart-ments concerned with the movement, accommodation and allocation of prisonersof war. I have examined this proposal carefully but have come to the conclusionthat it would not make for quicker or more efficient handling of the business toextend the composition and the duties of the Inter-Departmental Committee. Thequestion of the allocation of prisoners to particular employments concerns a great many Departments, and raises detailed questions of no interest to the one ortwo Departments which are concerned in the movement of prisoners to thiscountry and their accommodation prior to allocation to employment. I think the existing arrangements should stand whereby the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee is composed solely of those Departments directly concerned with theallocation to employment, other questions being dealt with ad hoc between the much less numerous Departments directly concerned.Conclusions.8. I recommend, accordingly, that the Inter-Departmental Committee onthe Employment of Prisoners of War should be instructed to proceed forthwith to arrange for the allocation of prisoners of war in 1946 on the lines set out inparagraphs 5 and 6 above.G. A. I.Ministry of labour and National Service, S.W. 1,1st Febmary, 1945.
