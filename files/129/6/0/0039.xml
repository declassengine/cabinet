(1+6 )37) raises two issues:-of Civil Aviation(a) Are the terms of the draft documents negotiated by our Bermuda Delegation and attached as Appendix IVto CP. (1+6)37 acceptable?(b) If    so, should signature take place now at Bermudaor be postponed for a subsequent meeting on the ministerial level?2,      I understand from CP. (1+6)37 that the Minister of CivilAviation would be prepared to accept the draft documents,  ifthey were amended to include an undertaking by the U.S.Administration to seek powers which would enable them to controlcapacity by operators as well as to fix fair and economicbut that,  if this cannot be secured, he does not from the purely civilrates;that he could recommend acceptanceaviation point of view.feel3. I consider that wedocuments, even if thisMy reasons are:-should be well advised to accept these further concession cannot be obtained.(a)    Two very important points have been secured:-(i)    Agreed control of rates (Article 2 of theAnnexe to the draft Agreement). &apos; This should ensure that American carriers cannot indulge in unfair competition by using profits on internal services to subsidies externalservices.(ii)    Review of the situation to ensure that aircarriers temporarily prevented through thelegacy of the war from malting their propercontribution, should be in&apos;positionincreasingly to do so (Article 7 of the draft agreement).    So long as we cannot carry the traffic offering, we cannot expect the americans to refrain from doing so;    but thisprovision should ensure that our operatorsare not placed in a position of permanentdisadvantage.

(b) The Americans have also accepted principles whichembody many of the other points in our Chicagopolicy.    Article 6 of the draft Agreement givesus freedom to refuse rights to any U.S.  carrierif we are satisfied that he is not observing these principles.    It is true that it may often be politically difficult to exercise this right.But surely it would be much more difficult todo so if we had no Agreement to quote asjustification?(c) I very much doubt whether we shall get the americans to agree to any further concessions tc our pointof view,    On the other hand a breakdown is likelyto have serious repercussions not only on theLoan Agreement but also on shipping, from which our earnings of foreign exchange before the war were running at ill00 millions a year.4.      Should my colleagues agree that we would be well advised to accept the draft documents, I trust that they will alsoagree that our Delegation should be given authority to signat Bermuda.    Both our Delegation and. His Majesty&apos;a ambassador at Washington have warned, us that a minority in the U.S.Delegation is opposed, to the concessions which have been madeby the Americans and. that if the agreement is not concluded at Bermuda, they may very well be successful in torpedoingit when they return to Washington,    Moreover, as will beseen from the attached telegram (ho.663   from Washington)our best friends in the State Department have advised us that immediate signature would have a powerful effect inconnection with the consideration of the Loan Agreement by congress.Intld)   K.D.Treasury Chambers, SoW*l*2ND FEBRUARY, 1946,

/THIS TELEGRAM IS OP PARTICULAR SECRECY AND SHOULD&quot; BERETAINED BY THE AUTHORISED RECIPIENT AND NOT PASSED ONj         39/CYPHER7 SPECIAL  t ( CIVIL AVIATION)PROM WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICEEarl of Halifax B. 10.53 p.m.  30th January, 19h6No. 66330th January, 1 9h6   R.    6,25 a,m.  31st January, 1 9h6Repeated to United Kingdom Delegation to CivilAviation Conference Bermuda,IMMEDIATEMy telegram No. 1+0 to Bermuda.Acheson and Clayton asked me to see them this morningabout the Civil Aviation Conference at Bermuda.    They saidthat text of agreement recommended by Conference to the twogovernments had been considered in Washington and referredto the President.    As a result, MB. Baker had been authorisedto sign the agreement.    Acheson emphasised that all branchesof the United States Government concerned, including War and navy Departments, and C.A.B* were in agreement with eachother and with air lines in regard to the settlement proposed.He again stressed the desirability of making a definite agreement at Bermuda.    Otherwise, when criticism of the agreement developedhere, as it no doubt would, there would be a risk that a pro-visional agreement might he undermined.2,      Acheson added that they did not propose that agreementrelating to commercial use of leased bases should be finallyconcluded at Bermuda but initialled ad referendum to the two? governments.; 3*     Acheson and Clayton expressed the very strong hope&apos;; that His Majesty&apos;s Government would find it possible to\ authorise Sir H. Self to accept the agreement also.    Theyi emphasised the powerful effect which a successful outcome toI the Conference would have on Congress in connexisn with consideration of loan agreements.    One of the strongestj points of attack on these agreements was that the loanI should have been made conditional on acceptance by HisMajesty&apos;s Government of various extraneous conditions.    the reply to this was not only that such an agreement was bad inI principle, but that there was nothing which could not beI settled by our two governments in a reasonable spirit of conciliation and compromise.    Telecommunications agreement hadbeen one example;  the civil aviation agreement would be evenmore striking.    Acheson and Clayton asked me-to represent tojyou their strong feeling on this matter.d,      I have only this evening received text of agreements, now&quot;-proposed and I have no doubt they raise a number of difficultjtechnical questions.    But on broad grounds of policy, I have no hesitation in urging yea to accept settlement of this inflammatorypaestion, which is recommended by our negotiators at Bermuda,Moreover, I would also recommend that we should&apos; act a quickly asDossible and strike, so that.full,Impact of success of negotiationsI Should come while the iron is hot.3.T.P.
