is document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s government)S E G R E T copy no. :;: tc.p.(US) hicabinetTIMBER FOR HOUSING AND FOR THE MINESJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of S&apos;tate for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.       As the Ministers responsible for Forestry, we desire tosubmit the following observations on the Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade headed &quot;Timber for Housing&quot;(C.P.(h6) hi).2.        Any additional fellings in this country, must have veryserious effects on the home forests.     Already fellings havebeen excessive and the urgent requirements of the mines havenecessitated cutting the younger trees to the detriment of future production of timber in this country.      If we continueto cut immature timber suitable for pit props we shall be damaging our future home supply of timber beyond repair for manyyears to come.3.        In these circumstances it is imperative that the gap inour requirements should be filled from some other source.     Weunderstand that Germany provides such a source and it wasagreed that every effort would be made to make supplies fromGermany available for home use.      While this matter is mentionedin the Paper under consideration we do not find that anysufficiently specific suggestions are made for acceleratingthe supply from Germany nor that any special note of urgencyis struck in the discussion of this aspect of the case.h*        In paragraph 7 of the paper the impression is given thatthe Forestry Ministers have agreed that home supplies can bedrawn on without difficulty.      This is far from being the case.The true position is that further home supplies, especially of mining timber,  can only be obtained at the expense ofirreparable damage to home forests.5.        The question of speeding up arrangements for obtainingearly supplies of timber from Germany was discussed by theMinisters&quot; concerned at a meeting held on 1 Oth January, 1946,and we have since represented to the President of the Board ofTrade that insufficient progress has been made.      We suggest that unless more effective steps are  taioen to obtain supplies of timber from Germany at the earliest date we are heading straight for afurther and disastrous depletion of immature woods in thiscountry or a possible curtailment of mining operations.J. W.T. W.Cabinet Office, s.W.1.6th February, 19h-6.
