THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1946..-251SECRET. Copy No.    3gCP. (46) 43.7th February, 1946.CABINET.COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP.Memorandum by the Postmaster-General.PUBLIC demand since the end of the war with Germany has shown a general desire for a commemorative postage stamp. No new issue of stamps has beenmade since the penny postage Centenary issue in 1940, and I therefore propose,in conjunction with the general victory celebrations, that one or, if time allows,two commemorative postage stamps should be issued. They would have a currency of approximately two months, which is the maximum available manu-facturing processes can be stretched to provide. The denominations chosen wouldbe the postage rates for ordinary letters to inland and overseas destinations, whichcomprise the great majority of postal communications.In consultation with the Fine Arts Commission and the Council ofIndustrial Design, I would propose immediately to invite selected artists tosubmit designs, and to issue general instructions to guide them in their task.The time factor is of very great importance. Allowing for the processes ofobtaining artists&apos; designs, the final approval by His Majesty of the design selected,production and distribution of the stamps, the very earliest date by which acommemorative issue could be ready for sale would be the second week in June.But to work to this date I should have to proceed at once.I am asking the Cabinet (1) to approve the issue of commemorative stamps in conjunction with theproposed victory celebrations;(2) to agree that I submit for His Majesty&apos;s pleasure that (a) peace and reconstruction rather than military victory should bethe main motive of the designs;(&amp;) these designs should include a non-traditional type omitting TheKing&apos;s head, as well clS R traditional type.L.G.P.O. Headquarters, E.C. 1,7th February, 1946.L31252]
