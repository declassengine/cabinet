THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1946.-------- 205SECRET. Copy No.     38CP. (46) 35.1st February, 1946.CABINET.REPORT BY THE MAN-POWER COMMITTEE ON THE MAN-power position DURING 1946.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Man-Power Committee feel that the Cabinet may wish to have beforethem an interim report on the man-power situation in 1946 when they considerthe memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (CP. (46) 32) covering the Economic Survey for 1946 prepared under the guidance of the Official steering committee on Economic Development.2.   The man-power situation during 1946 is likely to be dominated by twofeatures: (i) the combined needs of the Forces and of industry producing supplies and equipment for the Forces will call for a larger share of the avail-able man-power than they would in normal peacetime conditions; \(ii) except in a few areas, the demands for man-power for all purposes willbe continuously in excess of the available supply.3. Final decisions on the numbers to be maintained in the Forces or engaged on the production of supplies and equipment for the Forces have not yet beenreached, but the Defence Committee, at a meeting on the 21st January(D.O. (46) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1), agreed that, as a provisional basis for planning purposes, the Man-Power Committee should assume that the combined strengths of the Forces at the 31st December, 1946, would amount to 1,100,000 trained men and women. To this figure there falls to be added about 100,000 men andwomen in training for the Forces, with the result that a total of about 1,200,000men and women will have to be set aside for the Forces at the end of 1946.The Defence Committee also agreed at their meeting on the 21st Januarythat the maximum figure for the man-power engaged on the production of supplies and equipment for the Forces at the 31st December, 1946, should be 650,000. this figure covers not only man-power engaged on work for the Forces in the metal,engineering and chemical industries (Group I) but also man-power engaged onsuch work in the manufacturing industries (Group III). It does not, however,include man-power engaged on orders for civilian purposes (e.g., merchant ship-building, production of civil aircraft).Thus the total man-power needs of the Forces at the end of 1946 can be provisionally taken as 1,850,000.4. The Ministry of Labour and National Service have estimated that thetotal supply of man-power available to meet the requirements of defence andindustry at&apos;the end of 1946 will be 19,200,000. If the figure of 1,850,000 requiredfor the needs of the Forces is deducted from this total, 17,350,000 workers remainavailable to meet civilian needs at the end of 1946. As against this departments have estimated that a total Of 17,946,000 workers will be needed at that date.Thus, on the basis of the assumptions set out above and the requirements stated by Departments, the man-power deficit at the end of 1946 will be about 600,000,[31236]
which compares with the estimated deficit of 1,346,000 shown in Table A of theEconomic Survey for 1946 circulated under cover of CP. (46) 32. Although itis not possible to make precise estimates, it is clear that there will be a substantialdeficit throughout the year.5. The man-power requirements of the Forces and of civilian industries and services are set out under their main headings in the attached table (see annex). The requirements for civilian needs have been given by departments in the knowledge that all demands for labour during 1946 could not be met, andthey have modified their demands to a greater or less degree in the light of theamount of labour likely to be supplied. This is particularly true of coalmining.In other cases the adjustment has not yet been so large.6. The Man-Power Committee have concentrated their attention on what steps might be taken : (a) to increase the man-power available for civilian industries and Services;(b) to secure a greater output per head from the available man-power; and(c) to ensure the best distribution of the available man-power.7. To increase the available man-power, the Committee recommend thefollowing measures : (i) Acceleration of the release of man-power from work for the Forces. As indicated in paragraph 3 above, it has been assumed for planning purposes that the man-power engaged on the production of supplies and equipment for the Forces at the end of 1946 will not exceed650,000. If, however, the Supply Departments could spread the runiTO, G0&amp; down from the end-1945 figure to/65t000 over a period of 6 monthsinstead of over a period of 12 months there would be a very largegain to civilian industry in 1946. We have put this suggestion tothe Defence Committee, who will shortly be reviewing Service pro-duction programmes for 1946.(ii) Appeals to women and older workers to remain at work. An attempt should be made to check the retirement from industry of as many aspossible of the women and older men who took up employment duringthe war by appealing to them to remain at work. Appeals of thiskind must be carefully handled, having regard to the varying capacityof individual localities to absorb such workers, and any necessary action to stimulate recruitment should be taken by the Ministry ofLabour and National Service on a regional or local basis. Otherwiselarge numbers of women and older workers might respond to the appeal only to find that there were no suitable jobs for them in theirlocality. The most that could be expected from appeals of this kind would be an addition of 200,000 towards the reduction of the deficit.(iii) Man-power employed by the Forces on the care and maintenance of surplus stores and equipment and in quasi-civilian services. At therequest of the Committee a review has been made by the service departments of the man-power engaged on the care and maintenanceof surplus stores and equipment. The results show that a considerableamount of man-power in all three Services is engaged on the care and maintenance of stores and equipment in excess of the likely needsof the Services. Some of the equipment is of Lend-Lease origin andmust be maintained in good condition until agreement has been reached with the United States Government on its disposal. Other items of equipment are being held against expected commitments to re-equipAllied Forces. But there remains a large volume of equipment and stores, a proportion of which may well be articles urgently requiredto meet civilian consumer needs at the present time, which is not affected by the Lend-Lease agreement or our commitments to our allies. The Committee hope that it will be possible to reach decisionsat a very eaihy date on the disposal of Lend-Lease equipment andof equipment destined for Allied Forces. As regards other equipment and stores, the Committee have asked the Service Ministers to take all possible steps to speed up the declaration of surpluses now heldby them, particularly in the case of stores which would have animmediate civilian use.   This will not in itself achieve the desired
results unless the disposals machine can handle the surpluses as soonas they are declared. The Committee have accordingly asked the lord presidents Industrial Sub-Committee to review the working of thedisposals machine as a matter of urgency with a view to ensuring. that the goods reach the civilian market without delay.The Committee have also considered whether any further savings of Service man-power might be achieved by the transfer to civilianagencies of quasi-civilian services carried out by the Service Depart-ments. It seems clear, however, that, apart from services which mightbe undertaken by foreign or colonial labour, any savings would be offset to a greater or less extent by increased requirements for man-power for the civilian agencies to whom the services were transferred.(iv) Use of prisoner of war labour and foreign labour. The Committeesuggest that the man-power position in 1946 could be materiallyimproved if steps could be taken to increase the available prisoner of war labour beyond what Departments have already assumed inmaking their demands for 1946. Consideration may also have to begiven to the admission of workers from abroad (e.g., women for employ-ment in institutions or in domestic service).8. Even if all the measures suggested in paragraph 7 are adopted, therewill remain a substantial deficit and the Committee recommend that the statement about the economic position of the country proposed in paragraph 11 of CP. (46)32 should be followed by an appeal to industry to increase output. The appealmight take the form of a series of broadcasts by Ministers, supplemented by localmeetings at some of which Ministers would speak and by Press conferences. Anational conference of trade union executives and a separate conference ofemployers should also be held in London at which Ministers could explain theproblems of the transitional period and enlist their help in the drive to increase output.9. With regard to the incidence of the deficit, it must be recognised that itwill not be possible to secure the distribution among the different claimants ofthe man-power available for civilian industries with anything like the degree ofprecision achieved in wartime. Ex-service men and women have rights of rein-statement and many of them on release from the Forces will take up their former-work. In any case women (except nurses) of all ages and men over the age of 30are now free when they leave their present jobs to choose their employment. Inthese circumstances industries and services which are less essential from the imme-diate national point of view may be able to recruit additional workers while more essential industries and services will go short. In particular, the deficit is likelyto fall most heavily on the manufacturing industries, agriculture and civil nursing services.Much will depend upon the incentives to enter those industries and services which are most important from the national point of view. At present manysuch industries and services do not appear to be sufficiently attractive to labour.In some the work itself is unattractive and cannot be made attractive, i.e., tanning.In other cases the employment could be made more attractive if the working conditions and amenities could be improved, though such improvement will depend upon additional labour and materials being supplied, for maintenance and uponthe provision of amenities such as washing facilities, ventilation, &amp;c. Again, insome cases the wages and terms of employment may compare unfavourably withthe general wages level or with the wages and prospects in other forms ofemployment immediately available in the district.The extent to which the Government can adjust the wages structure over 1946is under investigation at the moment; and the Minister of Labour and NationalService has made a survey of the unattractive industries. This survey has shownthat special measures are needed to improve physical conditions, and the minister is taking active steps through his Factory Department to improve amenities inthese industries, while the Labour Co-ordinating Committee have been asked toconsider and report on what steps can be taken to improve methods of production,e.g., by increased mechanisation. In particular, it will be necessary for theProduction Departments to bring home to the industries concerned the likelihood of a continuing labour shortage and to encourage-them to consider what changes and improvements could be made in methods of production, so as to make theemployment less unattractive and to make the best possible use of such labour as is available.
10. To sum up, the Man-Power Committee believe that, if the measuressuggested in paragraphs 7 to 9 are pursued energetically, their cumulative effect should be to ease the position in 1946 considerably. It is clear, however, that itwill not be possible to wipe out the deficit completely or to ensure that in all caseslabour will flow to the industries and services where it is most needed in thenational interest.E.
