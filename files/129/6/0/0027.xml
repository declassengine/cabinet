I Have submitted to the Minister of War Transportprogrammes for my shipping requirements for February,March and April amounting to 1,315,000 tons,  1,232,000 tonsand 1,178,000 tons respectively.    Of the total of3,725,000 tons,  some slight amendment may be necessaryin regard to the April portion.2.      Out of the total of 3,725,000 tons approximately3 million tons or 80^ is required to cover my requirementsof cereals,  oilseeds, sugar and produce requiringrefrigerated shipping.3.      The wheat programme which is- the &quot;subject, -of a aoparatepaper, makes it absolutely essential that there should be shipped at least 317,000 tons in each of the months Feb.. aary,March and April from U,S.A/Canada,  of which 117,000 tons per month must be loaded on the Pacific Coast.    Under theterms of purchase with the Canadian Government, any quantitynot shipped in each particular month will be allocated toother claimants.    There is an additional requirement of45,000 tons per month for flour from the Atlantic coastU. S. ji.. /Qi an ad a ,4.      The sugar programme, which is falling behind schedule,amounts to 540,000 tens over the three months February - april and it is essential that this should be lifted if refiningis to be maintained at the required level,  and the desiredminimum stock position secured,5.      The oilseeds programme in the same period is approximately500,000&quot; tons and in view of the present world position of oils and fats its movement is a matter of absolute necessity.6.      The programme for meat, bacon, fish and dairy produceover &quot;the three months may amount to nearly 600,000&quot; tons andwill be moved in refrigerated tonnage which as far as canbe seen at present will be available to carry this quantity,7*      The balance of my programme of about 230,000 tons per month consists of commodities urgently required here if I amto maintain the minimum standard demanded.    It is comprisedof a wide range of commodities drawn from all areas.COPY NO.       ^

In view of the urgency of meetingmy requirements of the hulk commodities, the fact thatthe items mentioned in paragraph 6 are moved inspecialised shipping and that the remainder of myprogramme only amounts to approximately a quarter ofa million tons per month, I &quot;would ask that provisionfor shipment should be afforded first priority andthat the necessary currency be made available forthat part for which foreign shipping is required.This priority should apply for the three monthsFebruary, March and April, 192+6.(Intld.)Ministry of Food, W. 1.28TT-I JANUARY,  192+6.
