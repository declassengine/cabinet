THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   38CP. (46) 40.5th February, 1946.CABINET.ECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1946.Note by the Lord President of the Council.MY colleagues may be interested to read the annexed note by the central statistical Office and the Economic Section, showing how the proposed cats in theman-power for the Services and their Supply, referred to in the Report by theMan-Power Committee (CP. (46) 35), affect the stringency of economic resourcesthroughout the year 1946 revealed in the Economic Survey for 1946 (CP. (46) 32).H. M.Great George Street, S.W. 1,5th February, 1946.ANNEX.Economic Survey for 1946.The Prime Minister has recommended that by December 1946 the strengthof the Armed Forces should be reduced to 1,200,000 men and women and that thenumber of workers engaged on producing equipment and supplies for the forces should by the same date be reduced to 650,000. As a consequence the prospectiveman-power gap at the end of the year, which was estimated at 1,346,000 in cp. (46) 32, would with other assumptions unchanged be reduced to about600,000.The gap between target national income and the expenditure needed in 1946to allow departmental programmes and policies to be fulfilled, which was estimated at  470 million in CP. (46) 32, would also be affected by the PrimeMinisters recommendation. If the reduction to 650,000 in the number producingequipment and supplies for the Forces is achieved by June 1946, the gap will bereduced to about  375 million. If, instead, the reduction is not achieved untilthe end of the year and the strength at June 1946 is that assumed for the economic survey, the gap will, in fact, be bigger than the  470 million originallyestimated. This is due to the fact that the industrial force producing for theServices at the beginning of 1946 has, according to the Ministry of Labour&apos;latest figures, turned out to be 450,000 higher than the target laid down andwhich is assumed in the Economic Survey. By reason of this fact the prospectivegap during 1946 (in the absence of the proposed cuts in man-power for the armed forces and their supply) would have been considerably greater than that shownin the Economic Survey for 1946.The reduction in the gap comes largely from reducing Central Governmentdefence expenditure, though there would also be a slight increase in national income. Some small offset to this gain must be expected in the form of a net increase of investment in stocks and wrork in progress. The man-power gapwould be reduced more than the gap between projected expenditure and targetincome because the former relates to the deficiency of resources at the end of theyear while the latter reflects the average state of stringency throughout the year.[31251]
These man-power changes will, of course, in the end be of the greatest importance in restoring a balance between consumers&apos; incomes and the supply ofgoods and services for personal consumption; but they cannot be expected to result in any substantial improvement in this respect before the end of 1946. Thereduction in the strength of the Forces will bring an increase in personal incomes and a corresponding greater pressure on supplies, particularly in the form of gatuities and demobilisation clothing. Increased production will come late inthe year and must to a substantial extent take the form of a further building upof working capital. As a consequence the necessity to maintain savings at thevery high level shown in the Economic Survey remains undiminished.The full benefit could not be felt until 1947, when the increased labour force will be available from the beginning of the year and when the results of stock-building in 1946 will show themselves in the form of increased supplies becoming available for civilian use.
