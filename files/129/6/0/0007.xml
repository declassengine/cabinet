l&quot;LSi)0GUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. Copy NOtCP. (46) 7.&amp;th January, 1946.CABINET.PUBLICITY SERVICES IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of Information.WE wish to draw the attention of our colleagues to the importance of thework of British publicity and information services in promoting the aims of our foreign policy in Central and South-Eastern Europe and to ask them to agreethat high priority shall be given to this work in Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,Poland and Czechoslovakia.2. On the 12th July, 1945, the Cabinet agreed (CM. (45) 14th meeting,conclusion vi) that we should step up our propaganda in Italy so as to convince the Italians of the advantages of the Western democratic way of life. Wewould urge that at least equal importance should be attached to the propagationof information about British democratic ideas and institutions in other countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe where our political or strategic interests are of particular importance.3. In Greece British propaganda work has hitherto been carried on by themilitary authorities, and it is generally agreed that their work has been extremelyvaluable. Owing to demobilisation the War Office now have to relinquish this task and arrangements have been made for the Ministry of Information to assume responsibility for propaganda activities in Greece as from the 31st January, 1946.In Poland and Czechoslovakia there is a great demand for information aboutBritish affairs and much has already been done to meet it. In these two lattercountries the provision of information about British life and culture is probablyour most effective single means of preventing them from being absorbed into aclosed and exclusive Soviet sphere of influence and of keeping open the doorsbetween Eastern and Western Europe. Very similar considerations apply in thecase of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, both of which countries are of great strategic importance to us in view of our interest in the Mediterranean and the Straits.4. If this work is to be carried out effectively the Ministry of Informationmay require, as in the case of Italy, some increase of staff in its respective sectionsin London and Press Attached offices abroad, and also assistance in securing, in competition with the high salaries offered by Fleet Street and Wardour Street,highly qualified persons with the editorial and technical experience necessary forspecial duties such as publishing foreign language newspapers of the British A llytype in the countries in question or promoting the distribution of British films.Such projects will call for the special co-operation of the Treasury and probably also of the Service Departments in releasing or seconding suitable personnel.Moreover, while steps are being taken to increase the frequency of our air services to the capitals concerned, the Ministry of Information may still need special assistance, for instance through the adjustment of priorities, to ensure thatpublicity material, particularly newspapers and periodicals, is transportedpromptly, speedily and regularly.E. B.E. J. W.4:th January, 1946.13092   [31117]
