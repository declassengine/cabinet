The Cabinet agreed at their meeting on the 15th January(CM. (46)  5th Conclusions  (Minute 4)  to consider furtherupon my return from Washington the measures to be taken inthis country to meet the reduction in wheat/flour shipments to the United Kingdom during the six months30th June, 1946,approval, in thePresident of the with the problemconvenient to mymdingtheto which I agreed, with my colleagues&apos;course of my recent discussion with theUnited States of America.    Before dealingof meeting the deficiency it might becolleagues to have before them a summary oflast general review of theafter taking Into account theend of December,  1945,  thethe U.K. which would beaonths of 1946 in order tothe latest position.2. (a) In the course of theposition it was estimated thatshipments programmed up to the shipments of wheat and flour torequired during the first six isecure total bulk stocks of:-(i)    950,000 tons wheat,and(ii)    400,300 tons flour,at 50th June, 1946.would be 2,050,000 tons of wheat and 339,000 tons of flour, of which the total wheat equivalent was..................................&apos;000 tons,515/These estimated shipment   requirements were included inthe column headed &quot;Suggested Distribution&quot; in Ap-oendix II. of CP. (45)  348^7(b)    Actual shipments- of wheat to the United kingdom during the last half of 1945 were, however,  appreciably belowexpectations  (1,857,000 tons actual, as compared with1,995,000 tons expected) due to the diversion to India of40,000 tons of the quota allocated by the Canadian WheatBoard for loading during December to the United Kingdom from and to the diversion to the British Zone, of wheat which it was intendedin December but which has not so faree para.  6.    Actual shipments of flourthe Pacific Coast,of Germany ofto repay to the U.K.been renlaced - but112,500 tons

-    147during the last half of 1945 were larger than expected(279,000 tons actual as compared with 221,000 tons expected)hut it was decided to send 66,000 tons of flour to theBritish Zone in &apos;Germany from stocks in the United kingdom or afloat to the U.K. , and U.K.   stocks did not thereforebenefit from the increased shipments.    After taking accountof these developments and of the expected incidence ofsupplies during the latter part of the period under review,we informed the British Pood Mission that shipments of-2,050,000 tons of wheat and 339,000 tons of flour duringthe first half of 1946  (as referred to in (a) above) wereour essential minimum needs since it was estimated that under the changed circumstances they would secure totalbulk stocks in the U.K.  at 30th Jure, 1946 of only about -800,000 tons of wheatand378,000 tons of flour.(c) It will be seen,  therefore, that we made a sacrificein our stock position at that time of about 150,000 tons ofwheat and 22,000 tons of flour in accordance with the generalpolicy of making as much wheat and flour as possible availablefor other claimants.(d) By the terms of the Agreement between ourselves and the U.S.A.,  the United Kingdom,will now receive shipmentsin the form of wheat and of flour (wheat equivalent) of &apos;000 tonsonly   ........................................... 2,300leaving a deficiency of ............,............ 215^/Appendix II gives the allocations proposed in theWashington discussions in relation to the statedrequirements for each country^3.      The deficiency of .215,000 tons referred to at 2(d)  isan optimistic assessment.    In practice it will I fear be greater because it has been based on the assumption that90,000 tons of wheat will be shipped to the United kingdom from the Argentine before the em of June and th.at.we shallbe able to lift the total quantity of wheat which has been offered to us by Canada.    But the&apos; internal position in theArgentine is such as to make the frst of these assumptionsvery doubtful, while the second also appears to be incapable of fulfilment.    Under  the terms of the Canadian offer weare required to ship,  i.e.   to load, 200,000 tons a month fromthe Atlantic seaboard and 117,000 tons a month from the pacific seaboard,  any quantity unshipped at the end of each month beingallocated to other claimants of whom there are many.    We cannot press th.  Canadian Government,J^reJIaxthese terms which in any event are based upon sound practicalconsideration!;;.    Canada has been- very generous to the UnitedKingdom and to the countries for which we have procurementresponsibility.    Of the. total monthly quantity of wheat(300,000 tons) which she can make available for export during january/April on the Atlantic seaboard, Canada has allotted234,000 tons to&quot;the Ministry of Pood for the United Kingdom,and other urogrammes for which the Ministry has procurementresponsibility, leaving only 66,000 tons for all otherclaimants,  many of whom have been,  and will in future, be good/customers of Canada.

-    148- 4.      The.condition that any quantity unshipped to the UnitedKingdom at the end of each month shall he made available toother claimants,   cannot he questioned - it is clearly right.The fundamental need of the present time is to maximise wheatexports, and it would be.unreasonable and contrary to thegeneral interest to ask the Canadian Government to impede the flow of wheat to  the -ports by holding,  in store at theseaboard, wheat for which wo had failed to provide tonnage and to deny the wheat to other claimants able to put in tonnage immediately to ship it.    The only solution appearsto be to supply for the United Kingdom programme from canada sufficient tonnage to ensure the flexibilitynecessary to comply with the condition.    We may lose asmuch as 60,000 tons of Canadian wheat up to the 51st January,however,  and even if there be no further loss,  the actualdeficiency is greater by this amount.    Taking into accountalso the probable loss of the Argentine shipments, it seems likely that actual shipments from all sources may be at least100,000 tons below the theoretical allocation,  in which casethe actual deficiency may bo at least.............  315,000 tons.5.      On this basis,  therefore, I am faced with the need to effect a total saving up to the 50th June,  1946, of315,000 tons  (wheat equivalent).6,      Against this deficiency however, I hope to be able toset off the repayment to the United Kingdom account of the112,500 tons sent to Germany in November last out of United        ,Kingdom supplies.    This wheat was lent on a replacementbasis and should be recovered by the diversion to the UnitedKingdom of 112,500 tons of the wheat allotted to Germanyunder the agreed distribution.    Assuming this repayment beeffected the deficiency to be met would be reduced to202,000 ton--.7.      I propose to secure this saving as follows -Estimated  saving to 50th June 1946(wheat equivalent)1000 tons(i)    On the understanding that theyare built up again at theearliest practicable moment,to take the risk of regardingntial minimum total bulkstocks at 30th June as;-^ u     ?   \      -    775,000 tons wheat,  andV v. egypt*- 330,000 tons flour,as compared with:-500,000 tons wheat,  and578,000 tons flour,.referred to in 2 (b) above.This would result in a saving of:-25,000 tons wheat and48,000 tons flour,of which the wheat equivalent is  .....       91

(ii)    Increase the flour extraction ratefrom 80 per cent to 82-1- per cent onthe 23rd February and to 85 per centon the 9th March....................(iii)    Total saving .     ....................2078.      I hope to &quot;be dele to check by administrative action the run on our flour stocks which might otherwise follow thepublic announcement which will need to be made in regard tothe position and the steps wretch are being taken to remedy it.9.      I should warn my colleagues that the wheat and flourstock reductions which I propose involve taking a veryappreciable risk.    There will bo very little home grown wheatleft in this country at the one.  of June and. the new crop willnot become available in any significant quantity until theend of August or later, depending upon the weather.    Duringthe months of July and August we shall be wholly dependent&apos;upon imports for our consumption of wheat,  as the stockfigure which I have proposed allows for no reserve out ofwhich to meet deficiencies in imports.    The whole of the stockwill be needed as a working stock to keep the flour millsgoing and to maintain distribution, and will be too low even to achieve this with certainty.    Any deficiency or time lagin imports,  therefore, would have serious and immediateconsequences.    Our flour stock at the end of June similarlywill contain no appreciable reoervv, element   - it will all be needed, to maintain full distribution.10.      I do not recommend any further steps in the directionof conservation of our resources at this stage.    But theposition generally is by no means clear or assured.    Anyshortfall can be met only by increasing the extraction ratestill further and by adulterating the flour with barley,  ata further cost in terms of animal feeding stuffs.    If thesedevices be insufficient it would be necessary for me to propose measures designed, to secure some restrictions inour flour consumption,  the first of which might be theintroduction of a rationing scheme for cakes and., flourconfectionery on a level substantially below the present rate of consumption.    In the meantime I propose to embark upon a propaganda campaign against the waste of food.,  a practice which I believe has grown since the end. of the war.The appeal to the public will be relate;], to the world, food shortage generally and will not specifically refer tobread as such since the oarticularisation would not onlycreate certain practical difficulties but would disregard the wastage of other foods,  which is equally objectionable.11.      The effect of these proposals upon our livestockproduction will be serious and the Minister of Agricultureand I have given in Appendix I to this paper,  a briefappreciation of the position.    It will be necessary for theDepartments concerned to consider in what manner the reducedQuantity of feedingstuffs which will become available can beused to the best advantage and with the minimum effect uponnutritional s tandards.12.      I should -perhaps add. that a preliminary assessment ofthe world wheat position for the year beginning on1st July,  lO^G affords no ground for the belief that amplesupplies of wheat will be available for expert in that year.116

An increase in wheat acreages over those at present contemplated by the four exporting countries would improve the positionbut it must be borne in mind that world stocks at the30th June next will be at a very low -point and, for practical purposes, world import requirements during 1946/47 will haveto be met entirely out of the production of that year.    a partial failure of the crop in any of the four countries would accordingly be extremely seri ius.13.      In these circumstances I have suggested to the Ministerof Agriculture that an effort should be made to secure some increase in the production of wheat in the United kingdom for the 1946 harvest.14.     When the requirements of wheat from the home crop were under review in February,  1945,  it was considered that&quot;a U.K.acreage of 2fr millions would be desirable for the 1946 harvest.A lower figure of 2i millions was subsequently agreed as the acreage likely to be achieved without cropping direction, ameasure which the Agricultural Departments desired to abandonin respect of the crops for harvest in 1946,  and with thelower return to growers resulting from the reduction in the acreage subsidy from  4 to  2.15.      Preliminary figures now available of the acreage   sownto wheat in England and Wales in the autumn or 1945 indicate a small increase over comparable figures available at asimilar date last year.    But the favourable weather which prevailed last autumn enabled, farmers to  press on with workin the field and. to sow the maximum acreage to winter crops.In the previous year continuous rain prevented much of theland, which would normally have been sown in the autumn from being put down to winter wheat, with the result that a largeracreage had necessarily to be sown in the spring.    those conditions,  coupled with pressure by the   agricultural departments for the maximum sowing of spring wheat, resultedin a total acreage of wheat in the U.K.  in 1944/45 of2,279,000.    It is unlikely that without some financialincentive farmers would be willing,  in the spring of 1946,to sow as large an acreage to spring wheat as in the previous year,  and under present conditions io cannot be expected thatthe total wheat acreage in the U.K.  for the 1946 harvest will exceed. 2.1 million acr^s.    As a positive step to endeavour to achieve at least the additional 150,000 acres necessary tobring the figure up to the 2-jr millions originally agrexl,I suggest that a bonus of  3 per acre should be paid to farmers planting spring wheat this year.    This bonus would b ;in addition to the  2 per acre subsidy and could be regardedas outside  the terms of the general price review fixed inFebruary 1945.    I hope indeed that this incentive would besufficient to produce more than 150,000 acres of springwheat - I should, welcome at least 200,000 acres.16.      I commend to my colleagues also the desirability ofsecuringcn increase in the production of cereal feeding stuffsfor the 1946 harvest,  insofar as this is practicable inaddition to securing the necessary increase in the wheatacreage.    I see little prospect of being able to import anysubstantial quantity of cereal feeding stuffs until the present world wheat shortage has been overcome and we shall therefore have to depend to a greater extent than we had intended upon our own resources for feeding&apos;stuffs.

-    15117.      I must warn my colleagues that the quantity of wheat,assumed in my discussions with the Americans to he availablefor export from the four exportin   countries up to the30th June, 1946, may not,  in fact, be forthcoming.    Theonly figure&apos; upon which full reliance can be placed is thatfor Canada.    The figures for both Australia and Argentinemay prove to be too high while it remains to be seen whether the U.S.A.   can in fact,  Induce her farmers and merchants to sell the quantity of wheat needed to satisfyher projected export programme up to the 30th June, 1946.It may well be that total exports will be as much as one million tons short of the assume&apos;:, total of 12.390 million tons.The meet effective means of seenring an immediate increase in the quantity of wheat statistically availablefor export from the four main, exporting countries wouldbe by persuading them to increase their flour extractionrates &quot;from their present level to 80 per cent.    A preciseestimate of the effect of such a course cannot be given in theabsence of detailed statistics of flour production in thefour countries but the saving would be roughly of theorder of 200,000 tons of wheat a month if the extraction rate in all four countries were increased simultaneously to 80 per cent.    It should be pointed out, however, that thelarger part of the wheat saved by this measure of economy would be in the U, 8. A.  and,  bhe reservation as respects thepractical availability of this country&apos;s export surplusmade in the foregoing paragraph must therefore be borne in mind.18,      In conclusion I should draw the at Lent ion of my colleagues to the very severe cuts which had, to be madein the programmes for Ceylon and, &quot; Lher British territories in the L.F.C.  area and Far East.    The quantities suggestedin Appendix II of OP (45) 348 were believed to be the bare minimum but further reductions were unavoidable.There can be little doubt but that the quantities nowproposed, for these areas will be insufficient to enablethem to escape real harclship during the next few months.19.      Re commendationsI recommend my colleagues to agroo to the followingcourse of action(a) A reduction in U.K.   total bulk stocks of wheat and flour to 775,000 and 330,000 tons respectively at the50th June,  1946,  subject to the proviso that  they be built up again thereafter&apos;as - soon as practicable.    The total bulkstocks which I have previously regarded as essential minimaj are 900,000 tons wheat and 400&apos;,000 tons flour, and risks are being taken in falling below these figures.(b) Subject to the possibility of obtaining repayment ofthe loan to Germany (paragraph 6)jIncreases in the flour extraction - rate  (at present80 per cent) as follows:-(i)    to 82-g- per cent as from the 23ra February, 1946;(ii)    to 85 per cent,  as from 9th March,  1946.(It is essential that these dates should bu treated asstrietly c confidential).

(c) A propaganda campaign designed to check food wastein this country.(d) An invitation to the exporting countries -&apos; (i)    to increase their flour extraction rates to80 per cent at the earliest practicable noment,thereby releasing more wheat for export,(ii)    to increase their wheat acreage for 1946/47.20. Subject to the agreement of the Minister of Agriculture,the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary:-(i)    a propaganda campaign amongst farmers to stimulate the sowing of spring wheat for the 3.046 harvest;(ii)    the payment of a bonus of  3 in respect of everyacre of spring wheat sown in addition to thesubsidy payment of  2 per acre now payable;(iii)    a special effort to grow additional feeding stuffs in this country for the 1j46 harvest over and above the additional wheat recommended in 19 (a)to offset the expected loss of imports of coarsegrain.(Intld.)    E.S.Ministry of Pood28th January,  1946.-7-

APPENDIX IA review&apos;of the feeding stuffs position to the end ofSeptember next indicates that the volume of feed grainlikely to be imported into the United Kingdom will not*     permit of effect being given to the increased ration scale of feeding stuffs to pigs and poultry which should have become effective from May 1st in accordance with theCabinet decision in April last.It also seems that even the maintenance of the presentation scales to the end of September next will result in a deficit of the order of 100,000 tons of cereal feed.Should the proposal in paragraph 7 of the memorandum beadopted the&quot; availability of&quot;feeding stuffs will be further reduced by approximately 117,000 tons at the end of June,while for the period July/September inclusive an extraction rate of 85 per cent,  would result in a further decrease in thavailability of feeding stuffs of about 85,000 tons.    Thissuggests a total shortfall of animal feeding stuffs to theend of September of about 300,000 tons.It would seem that the initial cut must primarily bo-made at the expense of pigs and poultry.    This willprobably have the result of reducing the rations availableto pig and poultry to  the level which obtained prior to april, 1946.    Even this may not avoid the necessity ofmaking reductions in rations for other types of livestock,including priority classes.    One of the first items forconsideration would be the cut of the ration to autumncalvers with its possible repercussions upon winter milksupply.An indication of the magnitude of the loss of animal feeding stuffs is afforded by the fact that 300,000 tons ofcereal feed would produce about 450 million eggs, the equivalent of about ten eggs per head of the population.Alternatively the loss is roughly the equivalent of1-g- million pigs or 200 million gallons of milk.
