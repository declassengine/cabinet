THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.Copy No.CABINET.AIR TROOPING.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.AT the request of the Prime Minister, I circulate for consideration by theCabinet the attached papers containing proposals for reductions in the airtrooping programme.S.Air Ministry,8th January, 1946.(1)Copy of a Minute dated 3rd January, 1946, from General Ismay to thePrime Minister.Air Trooping.On the 18th December the Secretary of State for Air submitted to youa memorandum on accidents in relation to Air Trooping and on the question of areduction in themAir Trooping programme. He suggested that you should not take any decision until the Chiefs of Staff had considered the problem.2. The attached report,* which was considered and endorsed by the Chiefsof Staff at their meeting on the 2nd January, comments on the implications of theAir Ministry proposals for reducing the Air Trooping commitment. Briefly, theacceptance of these proposals means that -(a) Air Trooping between this country and India will be reduced forthwithfrom 10,000 to 5,000 a month in each direction and will remain at this rate until July, when it will progressively decrease to 2,000 a month inDecember 1946. The necessary increase in shipping lift can be pro-vided without prejudice to planned movement, but our ability to meetother bids, or to accelerate present programmes, will be correspondinglyaffected.(b) Air trooping by Bomber Command, who have lifted on the average6,000 a month between this country and Italy, will be suspended, atleast for 3 months. This will necessitate the continuance of theexpenditure of  20,000 a month (in Swiss currency) for the provisionof a train service between Italy and Northern France, to lift thes^personnel.(c) There will be some immediate saving of man-power by this suspension ofthe air service to Italy, but there will be no saving on the air routes toIndia owing to the continued use of the twin-engined route, contraryto the original intention.3. In view of the number of casualties sustained through accidents to air-craft engaged on air trooping between India and Italy and this country, theChiefs of Staff recommend that the proposed reductions be accepted. Althoughthe number of accidents has been relatively small, nearly every accident has beencostly in lives owing to the number of persons carried in each aircraft.  Now that* Report to the Chiefs of Staff by the Principal Administrative Officers written afterconsultation with the Ministry of War Transport and the India Office (not circulated).[31135] bSECRET.CP.

(3)Trooping Accidents.Memorandum by the Air Staff.We have now completed our review of the question of accidents to aircraftengaged on trooping.Rates of Accidents.2. The tables enclosed at Appendices A and B show the accident rates overthe last six months for trooping and for other transport flying. It will be notedthat the accident rate for transport flying generally is not unsatisfactory; therate for trooping, however, is materially higher. In trooping there has been oneaccident in every If million miles flying and in October and November, underworse weather conditions, only l  million, compared with 5-4 million for othertransport flying. The comparison in casualty rates is even more adverse : ontrooping we have had one casualty in 90,000 miles flown, compared with over500,000 miles for other services.3.   The reasons for the difference are : (a) The trooping route is a long one, with long stages, and parts of it havebeen in use for large-scale movement for only a short time.(6) The crews on the trooping route are in general less familiar with it than other transport crews with their regular routes.(c) A high proportion of the aircraft employed are converted bombers.(a) Commands other than Transport Command have been put on to trooping.(e) The number of passengers in each aircraft is on the average much higher in trooping, and so each accident is costlier.4. We will summarise below the action we have already taken to improve theposition.Personnel.5. Special standards of flying experience have been laid down for aircrewsbelow which they may not be utilised for passenger carrying and trooping. these have been reviewed by the Air Staff, in the light of the accident records, andare considered acceptable as a basis of general flying experience. Full efficiency,however, requires additional specialised training and experience on the route and with the type of aircraft operated, and this nothing but time and stabilitycan bring. Special training measures have for some time been in force in transport Command and are now being intensified, and are being introduced inother Commands.   In addition, transport crews will now be examined andthe war is over, they feel that the safety factor and a reduction in the number of accidents has become of primary importance.4.   The Chiefs of Staff therefore ask you to approve (i) the proposed reduction in the air trooping lift between the UnitedKingdom and India;(ii) the suspension for 3 months of air trooping between the United.Kingdomand Italy.(2)Prime Ministers Personal Minute, Serial No. M. 4/46.Secretary of State for Air. 10, Downing Street, Whitehall.I have received a Minute dated the 3rd January from General Ismay onbehalf of the Chiefs of Staff regarding the proposals in your Minute of the18th December for reductions in the air trooping programme.2. The matter is one which affects various departments and in thesecircumstances I consider that it should come to the Cabinet. Would you please,therefore, arrange accordingly.(Initialled) C. R. A.4:th January, 1946.
categorised regularly to check their ability on transport duties. But the valuethat can be obtained from these measures and any progress in building up anadequate number of highly experienced transport crews are offse,t by the rapidreplacement of crews which results from demobilisation.6. All that is possible is being done, by training and selection of personnel,to keep the ground organisation efficient. To this end overriding priority in theprovision of personnel has been given to units engaged on transport, at the expenseof the rest of the R.A.F. This does not, however, remedy the ill effects of thevery frequent postings which present release conditions make inevitable.7. The basic weakness, therefore, throughout the whole organisation is thatwe are carrying out this major operation during demobilisation. Safety in flyingis a product of training and experience, but, under the conditions of extremeinstability under which we are working, no sooner does a man gain experience in. his work than he has to be replaced. A small number of aircrew personnelhave been retained under the &quot; military necessity &quot; clause, but it is impossibleto resort to this on a large scale and it is naturally extremely unpopular. Theonly thing that can give any degree of stability is the recruitment of personnel on a regular basis, for which permission has already been sought.Aircraft.8. Though the Stirling has not been involved in more than two majoraccidents it has a record of minor accidents and unserviceability which generallyhampers the operation of the route. It needs a disproportionate amount ofmaintenance and is not fully fitted with de-icing equipment. We have accordingly withdrawn it from trooping. This will involve a reduction of 1,400a month in numbers carried (vide paragraph 19), though the loss will to someextent be counterbalanced in the long run by the more efficient operation of the route which the removal of this uneconomical aircraft allows.9. The short fall in production of Yorks involves increased use of theLiberator, which has a less satisfactory record, and, being a converted bomber,a smaller capacity. It will be recalled that the Manpower Committee did not agree to the measures the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production recom-mended for maintaining York production. The accelerated substitution of theYork for the Liberator would be a definite contribution to safety.10. The Merlin 24 engine, which is fitted in a proportion of the lancaster and a few of the York aircraft engaged, has been giving trouble. Special steps have been taken to increase the rate of modifying these engines.Facilities.11. The meteorological organisation along the route is being strengthened,in particular by increasing the number of aircraft engaged on meteorologicalreconnaissance. Pressure has already been put on the French to improve theirmeteorological facilities in the Mediterranean, but it would be helpful if this could be reinforced by asking His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to represent the urgency of it to the French Minister concerned. It would also be desirable to draw theattention of the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production to the importanceof the production of Radio Sonde equipment. In present circumstances it is reasonable to ask that we should not be deprived of relief that can be got byemploying this efficient and economical method of obtaining meteorological data.12. The radio side (Gee, V.H.F. and blind landing equipment) along the route are being increased, and additional airfield lighting is being installed13. It must be remembered that the personnel difficulties mentioned aboveapply to flying control, meteorological and radio personnel as much as to air crewsand maintenance personnel. For example, two-thirds of the most experiencedflying control personnel available on VJ-day have already been demobilised.14. Meteorological reconnaissance is a very difficult and disagreeable typeof flying, and we suggest that when the Under-Secretary of State for Air speakson this subject in the House of Commons he should refer not only to the aircrewson the routes, but to the admirable work of the pilots who obtain data for them. :[31135] b 2
Further measures recommended.A. Loadings.15. A committee was appointed to examine the necessity for decreasing theloadings of aircraft or alternatively for reducing the length of certain stages onthe route. The Committee&apos;s report shows that there is in general no scope foraltering the stages, because accommodation, maintenance, &amp;c, cannot be provided at new staging posts in the time available. The Committee has, however, recom-mended that although the Liberator and the Dakota are being operated at lessthan the approved maximum military loads, the loadings should be reduced tothose authorised for civil operation. (The loads on the other types used for transport are already the same as for civil operation.)16. The Liberator has hitherto been operated at 60,000 lbs., which is well within the approved operational figure. Nevertheless, the accident statisticsindicate that with this type of converted bomber, our holdings of which are nowmostly fairly old, a reduction to civil standards is justified and should appreciablycontribute to increased safety. We therefore agree with the recommendation that the maximum all-up weight should now be reduced to the civil figure of56,000 lbs. This will necessitate an alteration in the operating schedules, witha loss of 1,400 a month in numbers carried (vide paragraph 19). In anticipation of the Secretary of State for Air&apos;s approval this alteration has already been putinto effect.17. The Dakota is being operated at 30,500 lbs., which is lower than the approved operational limit. The figure recommended by the committee is28,000 lbs. The case for adopting the lower figure is not, however, free fromargument, because against the theoretical considerations supporting the lowerloading there is the fact that the Dakota has had an exceptional record of safety, and there is no indication from experience that any accidents would havebeen avoided if the lower loading had been adopted. On balance, the conclusion to which we have come is that, with the personnel difficulties with which the command is contending, it would be better to adopt the lower loading in thetrooping programme, and we recommend this for approval. The cost in numberscarried is about 1,200 a month (vide paragraph 19 below). We are examiningseparately the question of loadings on other Dakota services.B. Reduction of the Trooping Commitment.18. Although the reductions in loading described above would reduce thenumber of troops carried, and should make for safer flying, they would not resultin less flying than is at present involved in trooping. It is for consideration whether an easement of the flying effort should not be provided for, by means ofan arbitrary reduction in numbers carried, to give more time for training,categorisation of crews, &amp;c. The Commander-in-Chief, Transport Command,has said that he would welcome an arbitrary reduction of 1,000 a month in thenumbers to be carried over the United Kingdom/India route, over and above the reductions resulting from the measures already described, and we agree that thisis desirable.19. The numbers carried both ways over the United Kingdom/India routewould therefore, if all the measures described were put into effect, be as follows : Original Programme     ....      ...      ...      ... ...      ...       10,000Subtract:(a) For withdrawal of Stirling ...      ... ... 1,400(b) For alteration of Liberator loading ... ... 1,400(c) For alteration of Dakota loading ... &quot;... 1,200(a) For arbitrary reduction to assist training ... 1,000Total ......         5,000Revised Programme     ...        5,000C. Suspension of Operation. &quot; Dodge.&quot;20   Hitherto we have dealt, with trooping between India and the UnitedKingdom   There is also a service between Italy and the United Kingdom, whichis beino- carried out by the operational commands, with Lancasters.   This s
is used to the extent of approximately 20 per cent, for repatriation and 80 percent, leave. We have carried as many as 26,722 troops in a month on this servicewhen better weather prevailed, but there is no specific undertaking to the WarOffice as to the^ numbers to be lifted or indeed as to continuing this transportoperation.21. There have been several accidents on this service. The Lancaster,while a good aircraft, is suffering from the engine trouble with the Merlin 24already referred to and present personnel difficulties, both with aircrew andmaintenance personnel, are even more acutely felt in Bomber and CoastalCommands than in Transport Command. The route is a particularly difficult one to operate in winter, and in the circumstances we do not think it justifiable to continue to carry this traffic by air in winter. It is understood that examina-tion is likely to show that other means of transport can be found. It is recommended that the service should be suspended at least until the 31st March,1946.Conclusion.22. The Air Staff recommendations are, therefore, that the measures listed in paragraph 19 should be adopted, even though they will have the effect ofhalving our present trooping target for the United Kingdom-India route. It isalso recommended that operation &apos;&apos; Dodge &apos;&apos; should be suspended for the rest ofthe winter. The primary and immediate effect of these measures should be toreduce the number of casualties by reducing the number of troops carried. Theyshould also, with the other measures already1 taken and in hand, have the secondary effect of tending to reduce the rate of accidents. We wish to make itclear, however, that it is quite impossible to promise any specific improvementin the accident rate. We are dealing with unpredictable factors as well as withthe effect of continuing demobilisation, and all that can be said is that these measures should make towards greater safety.23. We must not expect a material increase in R.A.F. releases from thereduction of our commitments. Decreasing the loads of the Liberator andDakota will not reduce the number of sorties flown, and will thus have no effecton the squadrons concerned. The relief we propose to give the Command toenable training to be increased will not achieve its object if it is accompaniedby increased releases : the essence of the proposal is to keep the unit in being butto employ them to a greater extent on training and less on passenger-carrying.11th December, 1945.
