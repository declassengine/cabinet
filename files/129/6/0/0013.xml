O - O     THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   38CP. (46) 13.lA-th January, 1946.CABINET.POLISH ARMED FORCES  UNDER BRITISH COMMAND.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I consider it necessary to seek Cabinet guidance on the handling of thequestion of the Polish Armed Forces under our command.Recommendations.2. The conclusions to which I would ask my colleagues to agree are thefollowing : (i) The statement made by Mr. Winston Churchill on the 27th February,1945 (Annex I) should be interpreted as implying no guarantee of settlement in British territory or of British naturalisation for all members of the Polish Armed Forces under British command but as meaning that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be ready in collaboration with other Governments to give what assistance they can when thetime comes to enable those who have fought with us throughout thewar and have finally decided not to return to Poland to begin withtheir dependents a new life outside their own country,(ii) A statement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard tothe future of the Polish Armed Forces should be drawn up for com-munication to all Polish troops; it would be based upon information supplied by the Polish Provisional Government regarding theconditions offered to returning personnel and should make it clear thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government consider it to be the duty of all those whohave anything to contribute to the reconstruction of their country toreturn to Poland under these conditions.(iii) The statement must also contain information of a definitely discouragingnature about the prospects for those who do not return and should emphasise in particular that (a) there cannot be any question of thePolish troops under British command being preserved as an armed force and that (b) in execution of Mr. Churchill&apos;s pledge, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will&apos;give such assistance as is in their powerto enable those who fought wuth us throughout the war to start a newlife but they cannot offer to all the members of the Polish armed forces any guarantee of permission to enter civilian life and employ-ment in British territory at home or overseas or any promise of the automatic grant of British nationality.(iv) General Anders and the other Polish Commanders should be summoned to this country for consultation before the issue of the proposed state-ment and should be informed of its contents on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s-Government by myself and, if necessary, also by the Prime Minister.The Polish Commanders should be warned that those men who do notopt to return will probably have to be removed from their units and placed in separate military camps pending their demobilisation,(v) Those returning to Poland should be sent back by sea and every effort should be made to provide shipping for this purpose,(vi) We should give no indication to the Polish Provisional Government atpresent that we shall hand over to them any of the equipment nowbeing used by the three services of the Polish Armed Forces but should13110   [31164] b
reserve this question for later consideration in the light of our knowledge of the numbers electing to return and the development ofthe situation in Poland,(vii) I would propose to approach the French, Netherlands and belgian governments and any other Governments which show interest in securing Polish man-power with a view to ascertaining whether theywill accept members of the Polish Armed Forces for settlement,(viii) The Secretaries of State for India, for Dominion Affairs and for theColonies should be invited to explore with me in the most sympatheticspirit the possibility of settlement in the British Commonwealth and empire of those not returning to Poland,(ix) I should like to be authorised to explore with the Secretary of Statefor &quot;War the possibility of removing General Anders from command of the Polish Second Corps in Italy.Consideration.3. An account of this question up to November last was contained in cp. (45) 290 of the 17th November, 1945. A summary of this and later develop-ments and of the present position is annexed (Annex II). Briefly, the situationis that no substantial number of further volunteers has opted in recent monthsf or return to Poland; good progress has, however, been made with the repatria-tion of those who had already come forward; and it has been agreed with thePolish Provisional Government that, in order to encourage further men to return,the Warsaw Government should provide us with an adequate statement of theconditions offered to returning members of the armed forces to be issued to thetroops by the British authorities. I undertook that when this information was issued I would personally throw all my weight behind it with a view to securingthe return of the maximum number to Poland.4. It is clear that the Polish Forces cannot indefinitely remain under arms in this country, Italy and the Middle East and Germany. Indeed, those inGermany have recently attracted the attention of Marshal Zhukov and M. Molotov,and their continued presence in Germany may become a serious political embarrassment to us. Similarly, the Second Corps in Italy is the subject ofincessant public attacks by the Polish Government, who accuse General Andersof collaborating with subversive elements in Poland, keeping connexion withthem by courier and wireless, carrying on a violent anti-Warsaw and anti-Russianpropaganda, recruiting men from Poland and so on. And some of this is, I fear,true. With the approach of the Italian elections and the possibility of a peace treaty with Italy in the early summer, the presence of General Anders and hismen in Italy is becoming increasingly embarrassing to ourselves. Moreover, thePolish forces must be got out of Italy and the Middle East if we are to press for the removal of the Red Army from the Eastern European countries. Forall these reasons it is desirable that the Polish troops should be disbanded assoon as possible and that the maximum number should be persuaded to returnwillingly to Poland (where incidentally it is to be hoped they will strengthen the desire for contacts and friendship with this country). Moreover, I needhardly say that it is in the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government that as few aspossible of these men should be left on our hands, since the problem of dealingwith this &quot; hard core &quot; wnll be no easy one. There are thus three questions todeal with : (a) how to persuade as- many as possible to return; (p) what to do with those who do not choose to go;. (c) how to eliminate the pernicious influence of General Anders.5. As regards (a), I have been in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor War as to how to get the best results from the issue to the Polish armed forces of the information which is being supplied by the Warsaw Government,It is proposed that this information should be circulated so far as possible to every individual member of the Polish Armed Forces under our Command andthat it should be accompanied by a statement by myself on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, putting the case for return to&apos; Poland as strongly aspossible. General Morgan and the other British Commanders concerned considerthat there is little hope of ensuring substantial numbers of Poles returning to poland without the co-operation of the Polish Generals. It is the War Officeview, however, that there is no hope of getting such co-operation. I suggest,none the less, that the Polish Commanders overseas, having been informed ofthe situation by the British Commander-in-Chief concerned, should be brought
back to London in order that I should leave them in no doubt as to the attitude and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. In addition to this, Commandersoverseas should ensure that the publication of my announcement and of thePolish Provisional Governments terms are made with the closest possible Britishsupervision and that all possible steps are taken to reduce adverse propaganda and attempts to prevent Poles volunteering to return,6. The War Office view is that good results can only be obtained from the appeal to the men if my proposed statement contains information of a definitelydiscouraging nature as regards what we shall be able to do for those who do not return. It will be essential to give information on this point and would be unfair not to do so. The statement made in the House of Commons byMr. Winston Churchill oh the 27th February, 1945 (Annex I), has never beengiven any precise interpretation. It has given rise to an impression among thePoles that those who do not wish to go back will be maintained as part of theBritish Forces and has generally been very optimistically interpreted; it has undoubtedly been a strong influence against inclining the men to go back. It istherefore necessary to review now what we can do for those men who do not return.This is dealt with under (b) below (paragraphs 9 to 14).7. I consider it essential that those who wish to return should be sent backby sea. The experiment of sending back by land across Austria and Czechq-slovakia the 14,000 men who have already returned from Italy has shown allthe difficulties of this route. The journey involves getting Russian, american and Czech consent to all the arrangements as well as that of the Polish Provi-sional Government. This took an immensely long time to do and innumerabledifficulties had to be Overcome. Nor were the results very satisfactory. It wouldbe much better and I believe in the long run quicker to send the men back by sea and I ask the Cabinet to agree that shipping could be made available forthis purpose, subject to review if necessary when the time comes in the lightof other essential commitments.8. The Warsaw Government have suggested that the Polish Armed.forces should return to theni as units complete with their equipment. So far thenumbers returning from any one unit have not been sufficient to justify this andmen have returned with their personal arms and equipment only. If, however^the numbers willing to return enable us to keep in being reasonably effective units for return to Poland the War Office would, I understand, agree to their returnwith their unit equipment, less those items for which we would exert our rightof recapture. The principal items which we would wish to retain for ourpurposes would be tanks and motor cars. American equipment oh charge of polish units could only be taken back to Poland by agreement between the PolishProvisional Government and the United States Government.9. .4 s regards (&amp;) above, the future of those who do not finally wish to go backto Poland we shall be lucky, even in fairly favourable circumstances, if we are not.faced with the problem of disposing of at least 120,000 men and their dependents.To many of these men we Owe a debt of honour for their part in the war (though a proportion of them only came over to us from the Wehrmacht in the later stages).I consider that, at least as regards those who fought with us throughout andtheir dependents, we must at any rate give all the assistance we can in starting anew life. What are we to do with them and how are we to interpret Mr. winston churchill&apos;s statement regarding them?10. We have hitherto deliberately refrained from interpreting Mr.ChurchuTs statement for fear that by so doing we should confirm members of thePolish Armed Forces in their unwillingness to return to Poland. I consider thatthe time has now come when we can no longer evade the issue. The implications of the statement are far-reaching and we must in our own interests limit them as narrowly as possible. The interpretation which I have suggested in para-graph 2 (i) above for the guidance of Government Departments in dealing withenquiries on the subject considerably restricts the implications which might be read into Mr. Churchill&apos;s actual words. But I consider that we cannot in safetyor in fairness go further than this. I understand that the Home Office would seegreat objection to any legislation which would confer early naturalisation whole-sale on Poles merely by virtue of their military services. They consider that,assuming that the number of Poles who are allowed to settle in this country is reasonably small, the right way to interpret Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement would be togive thoste Poles who are allowed to settle here an opportunity to apply for[31164] b 2
naturalisation after, say, two or three years&apos; residence in a civilian capacity andsubject to the same enquiries as to character and fitness for naturalisation as aremade in other cases. I gather that in the view of the Dominions Office none of theDominions Governments would be likely to favour the early grant of naturalisation-tion to any substantial number of Poles, though it is possible that agreement mavshortly be reached among the members of the British Commonwealth that British. nationality conferred by one member should be accepted by all the others.11. Consultations at the official level with the Departments concernedregarding the possibility of settlement within the Empire give very pessimisticresults. The India Office consider that there is no scope for the employment of poles in India. The Colonial Office can only offer sympathetic consideration ontheir merits of applications from individual members of the Polish Armed forces who have already secured employment in the Colonies or wish to join relativesalready settled, and certain appointments on contract in the Colonial Service.The Dominions Office have not consulted Dominion Governments pending a clearer picture of our own position, but are not hopeful of their being able tomake a major contribution. It seems to me hard to believe that the whole BritishEmpire cannot be better than this and I propose to go into the matter myselfwith the Ministers concerned and hope that they will give me their help to theutmost of their ability. I Suggest, too, that the Dominions Secretary and I shouldtake the matter up with the Dominions Representatives over here for the general assembly of U.N.O.12. As regards settlement in this country the Home Office view is that theinflux of Poles on a large scale would present a most serious problem at thepresent time. It would cause obvious difficulties in present economic conditions and in view particularly of the housing shortage would involve a real risk of anti-alien agitation. The Home Office hope that in order to reduce as far as possiblethe numbers whose settlement in the United Kingdom may have to be considered it will be feasible to keep open as long as possible the opportunity of opting forreturn to Poland and to take active measures to find places of settlement outsidethe United Kingdom for those who ultimately refuse to return.13. France, the Netherlands and Belgium, have already shown themselveswilling to absorb Polish man-power, particulary for work in the mines. I proposeto continue to make all possible use of this outlet.14. There remains the immediate question of how members of the armed forces who do not choose to return are to be dealt with pending the final decision as to their future settlement, the investigation of which is bound to take sometime. The Polish Provisional Government are likely to take the view that thesemen should be separated from the rest as soon as their choice has been made anddemobilised at once. They will almost certainly disown them and probablydeprive them of Polish nationality. It would not be easy for us to disarm thesemen against their will or to look after them as civilians in Germany, Italy andthe Middle East. As regards this country the Home Office is in favour of their being kept together in camps, even if not in armed formations, for as long aspracticable before being admitted into civilian life. We shall, therefore, be unable to carry out quickly the process of demobilisation of those who are unwilling to return and they must remain subject to military law until arrange-ments can be made for their final disposal, though as pointed out in paragraph  it is going to be increasingly difficult to keep them in Italy and Germany.15. As regards (c), the influence of General Anders, I am convinced that early and drastic action is desirable. Whatever the degree of truth in the accusations-tions from Warsaw that he and the officers under his command are activelyencouraging subversive activities in Poland, there is no doubt that he is regarded by the Soviet and Polish Governments and by many people in Italy as the leader of a reactionary force. He himself makes little secret of his belief in theinevitability of war between Soviet Russia and the Western democracies, and itcannot be doubted that his chief object is to retain intact as long as possible theforces under his command as an independent Polish army abroad opposed to thepresent regime in Poland and embodying, as he sees it, the true traditions of thePolish State. He is generally believed, both by his friends and by his enemiesin Poland, to cherish the firm intention of using his army at the appropriate moment for decisive armed intervention in Poland&apos;s internal affairs. This beliefis a dangerously unsettling factor in Polish life and serves the ends of Russianpolicy. General Anders has a remarkable personal hold upon the imaginationand devotion of his own men and indeed of all Polish troops abroad.  It is argued
that for this reason we cannot in our own interests afford to remove him fromhis present position since without him we should be unable to hold together andcontrol the Polish forces in Italy. But do our interests really demand this ? our interest is to see General Anders&apos; army, for which I understand we have nofurther military use, disbanded as soon as possible and rendered impotent as amilitary force and as a political symbol. We must grasp this nettle soon and i cannot see that we stand to gain by further delay. General Anders himself is aman of firm convictions; he is unlikely radically to revise his beliefs and attitude in order to suit our convenience, and has indeed every reason to exploit his positionand our difficulties for his own ends, which are fundamentally opposed to the objects of British policy. I would, therefore, urge that the most thorough and careful consideration be given to removing him from his command at an earlydate, preferably before the issue of the proposed statement of British policy isissued to the Polish troops.16. In the light of the foregoing considerations I ask my colleagues to endorse the conclusions suggested in paragraph 2 above.E. B.Foreign Office, l&amp;th January, 1946.ANNEX I.Extract from Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) of the 27th February, 1945.IN any event, His Majesty&apos;s Government will never forget the debt they oweto the Polish troops who have served them so valiantly, and for all those whohave fought under our command I earnestly hope it may be possible to offer thecitizenship and freedom of the British Empire, if they so desire. I am notable to make a declaration on that subject to-day because all matters affectingcitizenship require to be discussed between this country and the Dominions, andthat takes time. But, so far as we are concerned, we should think it an honourto have such faithful and valiant warriors dwelling among us as if they weremen of our own blood.ANNEX II.AT the time of the transference of His Majesty&apos;s Governments recognitionfrom the London to the Warsaw Polish Government, these Polish forces consistedC )0of some 60^e0$irroops in this country, 110,000 in Italy, 11,000 in the Middle Eastand 30,000 in the British zone in Germany, including an Armoured Division anda parachute brigade. There were also 15,000 Poles (15 squadrons) in the RA.F.,and Naval forces consisting of 4,500 men (one old cruiser and 4 destroyers).2. The policy publicly announced and also stated to Stalin at Potsdam hasbeen that we wish to see the maximum number return to Poland, but we will notcompel those who are unwilling to return. It was clear that the men would want,and had a right, to as much information as possible about the Poland to whichthey would return and that they must be given time to make up their minds in thelight of as much information as could be provided. It was proposed to the PolishGovernment at a very early stage that they should send over a Military Mission todiscuss the whole matter and should provide information as to the treatment which returning members of the Polish Armed Forces under our Command would receive. The Polish Provisional Government have proved most difficult to dealwith on this whole matter. They claimed that all these forces should immediately be handed over to officers sent from Poland, and as regards the information forwhich we asked they referred us to various vague public pronouncements whichcarried no weight at all with the men under our Command. It was, of course,impossible to agree to hand over command. It would have led to a revolt, as wellas being inconsistent with our policy of compelling none of these men to go backagainst their will. Discussions were pursued with the Polish Ambassador and through our Embassy in Warsaw, but the Polish Provisional Government showedno goodwill and have carried on a very obnoxious pi&apos;opaganda against HisMajesty&apos;s Government on this subject.
3. In the meanwhile, it was made known among the Polish forces under ourCommand that any who wished to return to Poland should so signify and arrange-ments would be made to repatriate them. As a result some 23,000 from thiscountry and some 14,000 from Italy and the Middle East and some 400 fromGermany took advantage of this offer which, moreover, still remains open. those from Italy and the Middle East have now been sent back to Poland, and as a resultof the Cabinet decision on CP. (45) 290 of the 17th November last, shipping isbeing provided to transport those in this country, of whom the first batch of 2,000arrived at Danzig on the 4th January and others will follow as quickly as shipping and the speed of turn-round in Polish ports permits. Meanwhile, after completelyfruitless discussions with a Military Mission which the Polish ProvisionalGovernment were at last persuaded to send in October 1945, it was arrangedduring a recent visit here of the Polish Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs that the warsaw Government should provide us with an adequate statement of the con-ditions offered to members of the Armed Forces who return to be issued to thetroops by the British authorities. I undertook that, when this information was issued, I would personally throw all my weight behind it with a view to securingthe return of the maximum number to Poland.4. The Polish Provisional Government have continued to press their viewthat command should be handed over in toto to the Warsaw officers and alsocontend that the present arrangement under which the men who wish to go backhave to make this known should be changed for one under which those who refuseto go back should make a declaration to this effect; the Polish authorities havestated that they would then wash their hands of these men and that they should immediately be demobilised. We have hitherto resisted this proposal because itwould mean forcing the men straight away to make a final decision which we have considered unfair and which would certainly lead, if applied now, to a far larger number being left on our hands, since the majority of the men are anxious before deciding to await the results of the elections and the end of the winter in Poland.To demobilise at once would also lead to great difficulties, to which I will returnlater. Nevertheless, it was agreed with the Polish Vice-Minister for ForeignAffairs that we would be prepared to reconsider, six weeks after the issue of the agreed information to the Polish troops, when it should be possible to see whatwas the effect of its issue, the Warsaw proposal that the men not wishing to be repatriated should say so once and for all, instead as at present those who do wishto go back being allowed to volunteer whenever they choose.5. The Polish Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs also raised during his visit to London the possibility of equipment now being used by the Polish Armed Forcesbeing handed over to the Polish Provisional Government when the men return to poland. The Polish Provisional Government have been given no assurances onthis point.
