secret.P.(k6)  57tk January, 19u7.incopy no.ucabinetLONDON GAS supplies memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to thedifficulties in last week.;as supplies in the London area which occurred.2.        Last August (CM. (1+5)  23rd Conclusions, Minute l)  I informed the Cabinet of the need for further -manpower for the maintenance and operation of the Gas and Electricity Supply Industries, andthe requirements of the London Gas Undertakings were given to theMinistry of Labour.3.Arrangement stde for release Scheme to be allocated tc,300 men under the Class Bthe whole Gas Industry, but.of course, those men are coming out rather slowly, and they are too few, in any case,  to affect the position in London.k.        I am glad to say that outside London the Gas Industry is onthe whole able to meet requirements, even in severe weather, butthe position in London is very serious.      The only possible methodI can see for assisting the London Undertakings to meet possible^commitments if further severe weather occurs during this winter isfor additional military personnel to be put at their disposal andfor that personnel to work, for a time, as part of the Gas Industry.I am grateful to the War Office for the speed they displayed in finding 500 men during the emergency of last week, but must askfor arrangements to be made for further military personnel to bemade available.      In order that the men should be of real value,it will be necessary :-(i) that the men posted to the Gas Undertakings should remain at the work until the end of February; as it takes sometime and effort to train a soldier, it is clearly futileto keep on changing the military personnel;(ii) that they should be available for shift working, even ifit is not possible to accommodate the men near the works.Otherwise the men are only available for day shifts,which is of little value to the Industry.5.       I am consulting the Gas Undertakings as to the number of  jmilitary personnel whom they can absorb for dealing with a crisis.Even though the crisis is not at present in sight, I feel itnecessary to put the Industry in such a position that with theavailable plant they can make the maximum output even in severe weather.      Some of the men who will be required will be skilled ^listing in keeping the plant running during.ide Unions will have to bepersonnel, capable of asThe consent of the Tjbut I hope that in present circumstances that consentwill be obtained.&quot;the winter,obtained,(this document IS the property ^ op PIS britannic majesty1S government)

6.        I ought to add. that we only just escaped an interruption of supplies in electricity during this last,week of cold weather, though the output last week was very high.      Here again,  there is shortage of labour,  principallyfor the - construction and maintenance of the necessary plant,and I would net like my colleagues to assume that thisfortunate Q&apos;scape from an interruption of supply can be relied on.?.        Interruptions to the supplies of gas and electricitynot only cause acute discomfort and criticism among domestic consumers, but also have a serious effect on employment,as many factories are dependent on them for heat and power.3.        I hope,  therefore,  that it will be possible for theSecretary of State for War to make exceptional arrangementsfor these exceptional difficulties.      I cannot see that theGovernment can do anything more to meet the immediate problem.An increase in the number of releases under the Class 3Scheme could not have any appreciable effect in time to helpduring the next critical three months.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 17th January, 1946.
