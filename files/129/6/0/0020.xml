APPENDIX II.WORKING OF OPENCAST COAL ON THE WENTWORTHWOODHOUSE  ESTATE.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.THE total quantity of coal I desire to work on the Wentworth WoodhouseEstate (see my previous submission to the Lord Presidents Committee L.P. (46) 3)is 371,000 tons, of which 220,000 tons is the good quality Barnsley coal which is urgently required for the railways. I have already relinquished some 300,000 tonsof workable coal on the Estate to meet objections to the destruction of amenities.The modified proposals of my colleague, the Minister of Town and country planning, would result in my having to relinquish a further 231,000 tons, thusleaving only 140.000 tons to be worked, of which less than 60,000 would&apos; be thehigh-quality Barnsley coal.2. The Barnsley coal I desire to work is equivalent to nearly three-quarters of a week&apos;s requirements for the British railways. I have already reported theprecarious position of railway stocks, and the losses suffered during the Christmasand New Year holidays have worsened it. Stocks now stand at 1 - 8 weeks&apos; supply.I am further advised that I may receive demands for increased quantities of coal for bunkers. This would require coal of high quality and railway stocks wouldbe bound to suffer further depletion.3. The grounds of objection taken by my colleague are based on the destruc-tion of an amenity available to the general public in the locality. The estateis held in private ownership and, from information which I believe to be authentic,I understand that the public do not have free access to the Park as a whole butare only permitted to use the footpaths; they are further not, I understand,allowed to enter the plantations which are fenced off and gates padlocked.4. The Park is approximately three miles from the nearest centres of popu-lation Rotherham and Barnsley.5. So far as I can ascertain, there has been no evidence during the past three years of any extensive use of the facilities by the public generally. Thefootpaths are mainly used by people living nearby, notably estate workpeople.6. Access to the gardens is even more limited. Before the war the gardenswere thrown open on an average six times a year, including the Easter, Whit-suntide and August Bank Plolidays and the Annual Flower Show. It wascustomary for a charge of Is. a head to be made and the proceeds were devotedto charity. At these times the Mansion was also thrown open and the publicwere conducted round. Since the beginning of the war the Mansion has beenin occupation by the War Department and is still so occupied. The public,therefore, have been excluded in recent years and the resumption of the facilitiesthey previously enjoyed is likely to be deferred for some time to come. By thattime such disturbance as is inseparable from opencast working should have ceased and restoration largely effected. The intention would be to work the sites simultaneously and at a rate of extraction which, from the date of com-mencement of coal winning, would exhaust one site in four months, two in five,two in six and the largest, the Garden Site, in twelve months. In each casea further two months should be added to cover preparation work, such as the laying of access roads. Restoration of the surface should be completed within three months of coal extraction, provided the weather is dry enough to a1 low the top soil to be replaced. These are maximum periods, and at the worst, therefore,all operations should have ceased within about eighteen months from the dateof commencement, and the amenity should again become available to the public,although of course there will be the loss of the trees which cannot be made good.7. The point has been raised that irreparable harm may be done by the deposit of soil at the base of tree trunks. This possibility has not been over-looked. The proposed plan of working provides for the deposit of top soil andthe major part of the overburden on land free from trees. It would be necessaryto clear only sufficient space outside the excavation area for the deposition of theoverburden from the initial cut.[31188]
8. I submit that, in view of the difficulties in maintaining supplies for theBritish railways and in meeting as far as possible demands for bunkers and other purposes requiring high-grade coals, the urgent national need for coal shouldreceive the prior consideration.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,January, 1946.APPENDIX III.WORKING OF OPENCAST COAL IN WENT WORTH WOODHOUSKPARK.Statement by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.WHAT really matters in the case of Wentworth Woodhouse is not theMansion which, though fine, is not of outstanding merit and anyhow is not materially affected, but the whole environs of gardens and park. These were laid out in the eighteenth century by the famous landscape gardener, CapabilityBrown, and have been carefully maintained and renewed ever since. They forma composition which must be treated as a whole, and would be a landscapeof outstanding value anywhere. They are of quite a special value to the 150,000inhabitants of Rotherham and the surrounding district which is otherwise mostlyvery bare and grim. It has only a few score acres of public parkland, none of itas good as Wentworth and some of it already marred by opencast working.2. While the Park as a whole is private property, it is crossed by severalmuch-used public footpaths. One of these runs right across the main part ofthe Park (the Deer Park in front of the Mansion) and the public are allowed togo freely about this part. At Bank Holidays and other special occasions in summer the private gardens are also thrown open to the public and visited bythousands of people.3. Major Lloyd George, the then Minister of Fuel and Power, proposedlast winter to work various areas in the Park, but after full consideration agreed with my predecessor to limit working to a mainly open area south of the Gardenwhich could be subsantially restored to its former state. The understandingreached was that this was the only site that would be worked in the Park, and theother four sites that had been mentioned would not be further considered at all-except, of course, in circumstances, then unforeseeable, of really desperateemergency. This understanding was communicated to the Council for thePreservation of Rural England and is generally known to those interested,including the Local Authorities.4. When in September 1945 further working was proposed, I happened to be in the district and visited Wentworth myself with Colonel Landon (theEarFs agent) and representatives of Rotherham County Borough. In spite of theunderstanding mentioned above I felt that in view of the urgent need for coalit would not be right to object subject, of course, to satisfactory restoration to working simply on the score of the temporary disfigurement, inevitably very great,which it would involve. In particular I did not see objection to the temporaryclosing of the drive and footpaths while work was in progress. I was preparedto go further and accept the loss of some plantations and isolated trees that couldnot be made good for many years, so long as their loss would not materially affectthe general character of the Park as a whole.5. But the present proposals, even as restricted, go far beyond this. Theyhave been fully examined on the spot by my Chief Technical Officer, Mr. Pepler,whose judgment on such matters is very highly regarded by the interested public.A copy of his Report is attached.* The estimates of coal to be obtained from thevarious sites now given by the Minister of Fuel and Power are somewhat lessthan those noted by Mr. Pepler at the meeting; it is not for me to express any opinion on these estimates, which must obviously contain an element of doubt.The areas marked in the map to which Mr. Pepler&apos;s report refers do not include all the land needed for the deposit of the overburden. If this were depositedcarelessly it would be as destructive as actual working. I understand, however,that none of the overburden will be deposited on the Garden or any plantation.* Appendix IV.
and if this understanding is strictly maintained, the areas marked in the map,though less than the total areas to be requisitioned, show accurately the extent ofthe Gardens and plantations involved.6. I am satisfied from Mr. Peplers report and my own observation that any considerable working of the Garden and Mansion sites, and the eastern half ofTrowles Wood site -1, would destroy something of great value that could not bereplaced for several generations. The magnificent belt of beech trees on theGarden site and the main part of the woodland on the Mansion site are essential features of the general landscape and their loss would very greatly impair itsbeauty. The woodland on the Mansion site must be regarded substantially asa whole; if only a narrow strip were left as proposed, it would probably not standup against the wind. The removal of the row of beeches in the Garden wouldalso seriously expose other trees.7. Strong protests have been received from Rotherham County Borough,Kotherham Rural District Council, and Rawmarsh, Swinton and Wath-upon-Dearne Urban District Councils, who have pressed for a deputation to be receivedbefore any decision is taken. These representations are supported by theCouncil for the Preservation of Rural England, both locally and nationally, andby a large number of individuals, many of them miners living in the neighbouringtowns. There will probably be some public criticism even of the working to whichI am prepared to agreee, but I think most of those interested will be ready toaccept this much as a final settlement and not unreasonable compromise betweenthe conflicting public interests involved.8. I feel sure, however, that anything substantially in excess of this will cause widespread public criticism in many quarters. So far as I know, not evenduring the war has any famous landscape been damaged by Government action soconspicuously and permanently as this. It is a most serious question whether theamount of coal now involved (about a quarter of a million tons) justifies actionwhich will make many people think the Labour party are prepared to make a lesser effort to protect for public enjoyment the outstanding beauties of our countrythan were their predecessors.Ministry of Toivn and Country Planning.January 1946.L. S.APPENDIX IV.Report to the Minister of Town and Country Planning by Mr. G. L. Pepler.Chief Technical Officer, Ministry of Fuel and Power.   -Open Cast Coal Production at W entworth Woodhouse, Yorks.ACCOMPANIED by Mr. E. R. Voyce, M.T.P.I., Regional Planning Officer,I attended a conference at the offices of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, Sheffield,on the 8th December, 1945.Our general instructions were to hear and consider the information suppliedand the views expressed at the conference and to inspect the site with a view torecommending the maximum amount of additional coal that could be excavatedwithout so far destroying the general effect of the gardens and park that it couldnot be restored without serious impairment within a period of about five years.Present, in addition to ourselves, representatives of the following : Rotherham County Borough.Rotherham Rural District Council.Rotherham Regional Planning Committee.Wath-upon-Dearne Urban District Council.Council for the Preservation of Rural England (Sheffield Branch).Colonel Landon, Agent of the Earl Fitzwilliam.The Ministry of Fuel and Power : Judge Stewart, Regional Controller.Mr. Brown, Deputy Regional Controller.Mr. Voss, Regional Engineer.Mr. Clegg, Headquarters,and other technicians.
Judge Stewart was in the chair and began by saying that the coal must be worked and the purpose of the meeting was to see how it could be worked-witha minimum damage to amenities. He qualified this later by saying that if he didnot convince those present that enough was to be done to preserve amenities, thosewho took that view were entirely free to make representations to the Government.Judge Stewart and his colleagues then gave the following information withregard to the proposals.   A map is attached, Appendix I.*Doric Wall and Gardens Site.   (Marked &quot; A &quot; on Map.)There were 300,000 tons of the Barnsley seam available under the gardens,but the restricted working would take only 150,000 tons which would be obtained in nine months and restoration would take a further three months. The over-burden varied from 45 feet to 50 feet and the working would not come nearer themansion than some 420 feet.Mansion Site.   (Marked &quot; B &quot; on Map.)The area of the working had been so reduced that only 45,000 tons of Barnsleyseam coal would be won instead of the potential 72,000 tons. The greater partof the wood would have to go but the belt of trees to the north-west and the Dorictemple would be left.Trowles Wood Site.N.B. The coal under the other sites is of the Swallow Wood seam which isan inferior coal.Site l.t   This has been abandoned.Site 2.   (Marked &quot; C &quot; on Map.)   Would produce 67,000 tons.Site 3.   (Marked &quot; D &quot; on Map.)   Would produce 40,500 tons.Site 4. (Marked &quot; E &quot; on Map.) A tonnage of 46,000 had been proved andit was estimated that 37,000 tons would be won.Site 5.t This has been abandoned. The impression we gained was thatsites 1 and 5, which had together been estimated to produce about 32,000 tons, hadbeen abandoned because they would not be economical to work.Site 6. (Marked &quot; F &quot;on Map.) A tonnage of 82,000 has been proved and itwas estimated that from 65,000 to 75,000 tons would be won.Some general figures were given about sites 1 to 6 and it was stated thatthe original area to be requisitioned was 126 acres with a coal working area of37 acres. The whittling down which had already been done by the Ministry of fuel and Power brought the area to be requisitioned to 111 acres and of the 15acres saved 9 acres were woodlands.The Opposition.The chief point made was that this was not a question of preserving a noble-man^ park, but of preserving a park to which all the inhabitants of nearbyindustrial towns had free entry and which was the only decent bit of countryleft near Rotherham.A number of representatives were miners and while they agreed that theBarnsley seam which came under the Doric Wall and Garden Site and the MansionSite was good coal, they expressed the opinion that the Swallow Wood seam which came under the rest was of very poor quality and had further deteriorated owingto proximity to the surface. They maintained that there were large quantitiesof coal refuse available which, if mixed with slack, would produce a better fuel.Colonel Landon referred to the large amount of coal already extracted fromthe Wentworth Estate and to the plantations which had been particularly wellcared for.  This timber asset should be weighed in the balance as well as amenity.Following the conference all but the representatives of the Ministry of fuel and Power visited the site.The Sites.The park and gardens were laid out by Capability Brown at the end of the18th century and have been carefully maintained and renewed ever since. As awhole they form an outstanding landscape composition. The plantations whichare important features of the planned landscape have been exceptionally wellcared for and many ornamental trees give character to the park, i* The areas shown on the map are areas of extraction; much larger areas would be requiredto accommodate temporarily the heaped over-burden and contractors&apos; plant.f These are the two small &quot;cross-hatched&quot; areas near the bottom of the map at Appendix I.
The Doric Wall and Gardens Site. iThe Doric Wall is a notable architectural feature and is now to be preservedtogether with a strip of ground 50 feet wide on the north side. On the southside excavations have already been made up to the foot of the wall. About GO feetnorth of the wall there is a magnificent row of beech trees which are a prominentfeature of the landscape. The rest of the gardens which would be affected byexcavations comprise ornamental planting linked with the formal gardens,Camelia House, &amp;c, further north. Also there is a high mound at the top ofwhich there is the tank which supplies all the gardens with water.To leave the Doric Wall, which is a retaining wall, in isolation would serveno purpose, and the destruction of the trees and ornamental planting would makea breach that it would take two generations to heal.Mansion Site.This comprises a plantation which is also a prominent feature of the land-scape. If only the northern and higher end were left, as is proposed, it is unlikelythat this small group of trees would survive the exposure to wind and weather.Trowles Wood.Sites 2 and 3. These comprise pleasantly planted parkland. If excavated,numerous good trees will be destroyed, but it should be possible to restore a reason-ably pleasant although less rich landscape in a few years.Sites 3 and 4 involve the temporary diversion&apos; of a public footpath and theprincipal drive to the Mansion.Site 4. The half east of the drive is a vigorous plantation which forms anessential part of the landscape composition. If the western half were restoredafter excavation no permanent harm would be done.Site 6. Two-thirds is pleasant woodland and a public footpath crosses the site. A breach into a larger plantation will mar the landscape but not irreparablyif sufficient care is taken to avoid destroying a wider area in the course ofexcavation and to restore and replant.The public footpaths are shown on the map (Appendix I), but we were informed that the public are not restricted to the paths but are allowed to roamfreely over the park. It was stated that over 10,000 people visited the gardens onAugust Bank Holiday last year. Several of the footpaths and drives will have tobe diverted while excavation proceeds.Conclusions.In describing the sites I have commented on the effects of the proposedexcavations. As this is a planned landscape, of which the gardens, plantationsand park planting are prominent features, it is obvious that any interference withthese features will spoil the composition. In course of time this could be made good, but restoration within one or two generations would not be possible asregards the Doric Wall gardens, the major part of the Mansion site and theplanted eastern half of site 4.Strict control will have to be maintained over the contractors or irreparabledamage will be done by the temporary stacking of overburden and contractors&apos;plant. Also blasting operations will need careful supervision. All traces of theaccess roads must be made good. Surface levels must be restored and made good and replanting carried out and the footpaths and drives replaced. On thefinancial debit side the destruction of well grown but immature hardwoodplantations must be taken into account.Footpaths.Ministry of Fuel and Powor,10th December, 1945.G. T. P.
