THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 3.3rd January, 1946.CABINET.NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.FOLLOWING the Cabinefs decision of the 20th December last (CM. (45)65th meeting), I append the heads of my proposed National Health Service Bill.2. As authorised at that meeting, I am about to enter into discussions withthe principal interests concerned. I want to do this on the basis that all themain features of the attached proposals must stand, and that any concessionsor adjustments will be only in the detailed ways and means of carrying theproposals out. It is therefore important for me to know clearly, at this stage,that my proposals have the full backing of my colleagues.3. If a Bill on these lines is introduced in March, I think it can be safelycarried through all its stages this session. It will involve several very big points of controversy (e.g., the taking over of the hospitals) which will be essentiallysecond reading issues. These surmounted, there will be, no doubt, a very wide range of committee points, but I think that most of them will not be on reallycritical issues. While, in short, there will be much detail in committee, the moreemotional stages should be got over on second reading, I think.4. I estimate this to be a Bill of some fifty clauses. It need not containvery much of the detailed arrangements of the new service, which can be left to subsequent regulations and which will involve close negotiation with the profes-sional and other interests after the Bill is passed and before it operates. In anycase, in a service of this kind, it is undesirable to tie up the administration tootightly by the Bill itself, and there must be reasonable freedom for flexibleadministration through Ministerial regulations afterwards. If the Bill is passed this year, I should hope to operate it in January 1948, but the &quot; appointed day &quot;can be left by the Bill to be fixed by the Minister and the fixing must be properlyrelated to the corresponding day for National Insurance.5. To keep to these proposed arrangements it is essential to get the drafting of the Bill started, and 1 should like authority to have this done at once. already the whole situation of the existing health services is confused and uncertainthrough the knowledge that a general reconstruction is impending. When my discussions with the various interests begin, this situation will be temporarilyworsened, and I am most anxious that there should be the shortest possibleinterval before specific proposals are published and present uncertainties removed.6.   I therefore ask (a) for approval of the appended heads of the Bill;(b) for authority to have the drafting of the Bill started immediately.A. B.3rd January, 1946.[31112]b
