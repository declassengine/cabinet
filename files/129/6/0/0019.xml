(S^a^Jj^J ^jij^L (JoTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1946.        ,SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 19.ldth January, 1946.CABINET.POLISH ARMED FORCES UNDER BRITISH COMMAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.WHILE I do not disagree with the proposals for the immediate futurecontained in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum CP. (46) 13, I should like todraw the attention of my colleagues to certain special considerations which applyto the Polish Air Force.Unlike the Polish Army, which has been a separate Force serving under itsown Commanders up to the rank of General (and only under higher british control), and the great majority of whose members have never entered thiscountry, the Polish Air Force was very largely absorbed into the Royal Air Forcein the United Kingdom. Each station at which Poles served has been commandedby a British Station Commander; while Polish officers have been appointed toposts on the R.A.F. establishment. The training, organisation, and conditionsof service of the Polish Air Force have been identical with those of the RoyalAir Force; the Poles have lived with our airmen and have acquired a considerableknowledge of English and of the British way of living. They are well liked andthey have, from the time of the Battle of Britain onwards, shown outstandinggallantry and devotion to duty.Polish airmen have, therefore, special claims on us, and I am particularly anxious that they should not be treated in any way which might appear shabby.I have a number of practical suggestions to make for the treatment of thosePolish airmen who do not elect to return to Poland, and subject to the concurrence of the Cabinet, I suggest that these proposals should be discussed between myofficials and those of the Foreign Office and the Home Office.S.A ir Ministry,\$th January, 1946.[31185]
