THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.20SECRET.Copy No.CP. (46) 34.31st January, 1946.CABINET.ALLIED CONTROL IN AUSTRIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Overseas Reconstruction Committee have considered proposals submitted by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for the negotiation of anew Agreement between the Occupying Powers re-defining the scope of allied control in Austria.Now that there is a freely elected Government in Austria, the extent ofAllied control should be modified; and the Committee recommend that the british representative on the Allied. Control Council should take the initiative in proposing a new Agreement in the terms of the draft annexed to thismemorandum.2. The effect of this new Agreement would be that in nearly all fields theAustrian Government would be free to make laws, to take administrative action and to enter into international agreements, subject only to the veto of the allied control Council. As that veto must be unanimous, the effect would be that, failingquadripartite agreement on the exercise of the veto in particular instances, theAustrian Government would be free to proceed in all matters save those specificallyreserved to the Allied Control Council by Articles 2 (c) and 5 of the draft agreement.3. I invite the special attention of the Cabinet to two important provisions in the draft Agreement(a) Article 8 provides that the occupying forces in each zone shall be reducedto 25,000 by the 30th June, 1946.(b) Article 4 provides for the early removal of existing restrictions on the movements of trade and persons between the various zones. Thislifting of the zonal barriers is essential if the new Austrian Govern-ment are to exercise proper authority over the whole territory and toorganise an integrated economy; and it is in any event implicit in theproposal that U.N.R.R.A. should assume responsibility for supplies to austria. It must, however, be recognised that the consequentialequalising of standards of living throughout Austria will mean, forthe time being, some depression of standards in the western zones andparticularly in the British zone.4. The Overseas Reconstruction Committee are satisfied that this draft agreement is on right lines, and they think it advantageous that the british representative should take the initiative in proposing it at the Allied control council in Vienna.I ask the Cabinet to approve the course recommended by the Committee.E.
