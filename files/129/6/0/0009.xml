&quot;THIS DOCUIvIENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNIvIENT)secret.P.(h6)  98TH JANUARY,  19U6i7cCOPY NO. 2$CABINETMALAYAN CONSTITUT IONSNote &quot;by the Acting. Chairman of the Colonial AffairsCommitteeAs my colleagues are aware, the Straits Settlements(Repeal; Bill is to he introduced in the House of Lordsat the beginning of the next Session.     This Bill is requiredto give effect to the new constitutional measures for Nalayawhich the Secretary of State for the Colonies announced in theHouse of Commons on the 10th October, 19U5 (Hansard Volume klh.,No.13* Column 255).2.      The, annouricement only briefly outlined the proposedconstitutional arrangements for the Malayan Union and Singap^e.,and it is desirable that further information in the form of white Paper should he available for Members of both Houseswhen the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Bill is taken.3.     The Colonial Affairs Committee considered at a raeetin ;on the7th January, a draft White Paper which was preparedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the text ofwhich is contained in the Annex, and agreed to submit for early Cabinet approval a recommendation that the white paper should be laid not later than the &quot;beginning of the next session.k*      I trust that my colleagues will agree to this.(intl&apos;d&apos;d)   A.Dominions Office, S.W.1.8TH JANUARY, 1946.annex draft of White Paper concerning Statementof Policy for the future constitution of the MalayanUnion and the Colony of SingaporePrevious 1.      The territories concerned in this statementposition. comprise first, the Colony of the straits settlements (that is to say Singapore, Penang,and Malacca, in Malaya; Labuan off the North coast of Borneo; and Christinas Island and theCoco^-Keeling Islands to the south of Sumatra);secondly, the Federated Malay States of Perak,Selanger, Ncgri Sembilan, and Pahang, in the malay Peninsula;    and thirdly, the Unfederated-1-

Malay States of Johore, Keel ah, Kelantan,Trenganu and Pcrlis, also in the Malay Peninsula.The Colony of the Straits Settlements was,&quot;before its occupation &quot;by the Japanese, underdirect British administration.      In the malay states, on the other hand, British authorityrested upon agreements concluded with the Rulers,under which each Ruler retained sovereignty inhis State, though each was &quot;bound to acceptBritish advice on all matters except Mohammedanreligion and Malay custom.      Administrativeco-ordination was achieved &quot;by the Governor ofthe Straits Settlements in his capacity as HighCommissioner for the Malay States.      AsGovernor of the Straits Settlements he was indirect charge of the Colony&apos;s administration;on matters pertaining to the Federated malay states, as High Commissioner, he exercisedhis functions through the British Resident ineach of the four States and through the FederalSecretary at the Headquarters of the federal government (Kuala   Lumpur);    on the businessof the Unfederated Malay States, again as HighCommissioner, he exercised his functions through an Adviser in each State.      This co-ordinationhad, however, to he effected through a variety of legislatures and administrations.    legislation in the Colony was enacted by the LegislativeCouncil of the Straits Settlements, legislation in the Federated Malay States by the federal council and each State Council, and legislation in each Unfederated Malay State by the state council of each State.      Uniformity of legislation in the Malay States, therefore, required separateaction by at least six, and in some cases by ten,legislatures.Need for 2.      This divided and separatist position inreform. a    country scarcely larger than England wasformerly not inappropriate and in many waysindeed can be shown to have represented a necessary and useful stage in the development ofthe several States.     But the increasingcomplexity of modern^ administrative,  economicand social developments demand a system ofgovernment less cumbersome, more adequate for large common services, and making better use oftime and labour.     A return to the old positionwould be manifestly contrary to the interestsof the territories and their inhabitants in thepost-war world, with its difficulties arising outof the war,  and, for Malaya, the special problemscreated by the Japanese occupation.      A stagehas now been reached when the system of governmentshould be simplified and reformed.      international relations as well as the security and other interests of the British Commonwealth require that Malaya should be able to exercise aninfluence as a United and enlightened countryappropriate to her economic and strategic importance.    On a longer view, too, the pre-warsystem will not lend itself to that politicaladjustment which will offer, through broad-based

H.M. topossessjurisdictionin malay states.Outline of proposals.institutions in which the whole community canparticipate, the means and prospect of developingMalaya&apos;s capacity in the direction of responsibleself-government.      In this development all thosewho have made the country their homeland shouldhave the opportunity of a due share in thecountry&apos;s political and cultural&apos; institutions.Efficiency and democratic progress alike demandtherefore that the system of government shouldbe simplified and reformed.3.      The British Crown must provide the commonlink which will draw together the communities of malaya and promote a sense of common interestand the development of common institutions.Under the old situation His Majesty had nojurisdiction in any of the Malay States,although under the Treaties the Malay Rulershad. to accept British advice (except in mattersof religion and custom).     The new policy howeverrequires that His Majesty should havejurisdiction in the Malay States, so that he maybe enabled to legislate for ail the States alikeunder the Foreign Jurisdiction Act.     AccordinglySir Harold MacMichael, as Special Representativeof His Majesty&apos;s Government, has been engaged ona Mission to the Malay States and has successfullyconcluded with each of the Malay Rulers,  afterconsultations conducted with friendliness and goodwill, an Agreement which, supplementingthe existing Treaties, grants full.;&apos;-jurisdiction in each State to His Majesty,    ,/Por the directionsgiven to Sir Harold MacMichael see Appendix/7.U.      It is proposed that the present combination of the Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca,and Singapore in one political unit should bereadjusted on the following lines:(a.) the Settlement of Singapore should bea separate Colony;    and(b) the Settlements of Penang and Malaccashould be administered with- the malay States in a Malayan Union,special position of singapore.These proposals will be far as the Maliittcarried into effect, soare concerned, under theForeign Jurisdiction Act, 1890,  and, asregards the Straits Settlements, under legislationnow before Parliament (the Straits Settlements(Repeal) Bill.)5.      In considering the need for a closer politicalintegration in Malaya, His Majesty&apos;s government consider that,  at least for the time being,Singapore requires separate.treatment.      It isa centre of entrepot trade on a very large scale and has economic and social interests

distinct from those of the mainland.      It is recognised, however, that there were and will be close ties between Singapore and the mainland,and it is no part of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to preclude or prejudice in any waythe fusion of Singapore and the Malayan union in a wider union at a later date should it beconsidered that such a course were desirable.The Colony 6. As mentioned above, the Settlement of&quot;of Singapore   Singapore, with which will be included theCocos-Keeling Islands and Christmas Island, willbe consituted as the Colony of Singapore undera Governor with an Executive and a LegislativeCouncil.     During a transitional phase betweenthe termination of the present military administration and the inauguration of the newconstitution, the Governor will be empowered to legislate with the help of an Advisory Council,which he will be instructed to select on abasis as broadly representative as conditionsin this phase allow.      During this phase he willbe instructed to give careful consideration tothe questions of&quot; the composition of the ExecutiveCouncil and of appointment and election to theLegislative Council, so as to ensure full and effective representation of the various sectionsof the community.Eor the purposes of local government, theMunicipality of Singapore,  the Harbour Board,and the Singapore Improvement Trust will be reconstituted and set to work with the minimum of delay.     During the transitional phasementioned above the Governor will be instructedto give careful consideration to broadening the sphere of authority of the Municipal Commissionand its basis of representation.The Malayan 7* The constitution of the Malayan Union willUnion. &apos;     provide for a central authority consisting of a governor with an Executive and a LegislativeCouncil.      In each State and Settlement therewill be a local Council which will have such powers of administration and subsidiary legisla-tion delegated to it by the central authority,as are appropriate to the purposes of localgovernment.     -These Councils both central andlocal, will consist of official and unofficial members;    but, while it is the intention thattheir consitution shall be broad-based and representative, the final determination of numbers and of the details of representationwill not be decided until there has beenconsultation with local opinion.      In the initial phase after the termination of theMilitary Administration and before the newconstitution is brought into effect, theGovernor will be empowered to enact necessary legislation with the help of an Advisory Council,which he will be instructed to select on a basis as broadly representative as conditions in thisphase allow.      During this phase the Governorwill be instructed to complete his localconsultations with a view to the formal institu-tion of the Executive and Legislative Councils-   as soon as possible.

These changes in the legislative system will have respect for the continuity of theprinciples of land policy in the Malay States.The Malay Lands Reservation policy,  inparticular will he maintained.. 8.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have &quot;borne in mind the special position of the Malay Rulersas traditional and spiritual leaders of the malay people.    It is intended,  therefore, thatthe Ruler in each State shall preside over aMalay Advisory Council whose members he will appoint,  subject to the approval of the Governor.The main functions of these Malay Advisory council will relate to matters affecting Mohammedanreligion;    but they may also advise the Ruleron other matters at the request of the resident commissioner acting with the Governor&apos;s approval.On matters of Mohcanmedan religion, excepting thecollection of tithes and taxes,  each Ruler, withthe help of his Council, will have legislative powers within his State.      Such legislation willrequire the Governor&apos;o assent,  and for thispurpose he will be assisted by a central advisory Council of the Malay Rulers sittingtogether under his Chairmanship.      In additionto passing in review all legislation affectingMohammedan religion this central Advisory council may discuss other subjects,  either at the instanceof the Governor or at the.instance of any ofthe Rulers with the Governor&apos;s consent.     Bythese   arrangements it will be ensured that each of the Rulers can play his part not onlyin the affairs of his State but in the futured development of &quot;Malaya as a whole.     Sach Rulerwill of course be assured of a Civil Listappropriate to his dignity.9.      There will be a special need to developharmonious and mutually profitable relationsbetween the Malayan Union and Singapore on matters of trade.      Subjects of pan-Malayanimportance which require full identity ofpolicy throughout Malaya, - such as higher education, Immigration;, Currency, Income Tax,Civil Aviation, Posts and Telegraphs, shipping and other matters, will be matters of commonarrangement between the Union and the Colony.The currency will continue to be managed under&apos;pan-Malayan agreement.10.    The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is topromote a broad-based citizenship which will include, without discrimination of race or creed,all who can establish a claim, by reason of birth or a suitable period of residence,  to belong to the country.    It is proposed, therefore,to create by Order in Council a Malayan UnionCitizenship.      The following persons will acquireMalayan Union Citizenship:-(a) persons born in the territory of theUnion or of the Colony of Singapore

(b) persons who at the date on which theOrder in Council becomes operativehave been ordinarily resident inthose territories for ten years outof the preceding fifteen.    (in calculating the fifteen years&apos;period, the period of japanese occupation will be disregarded).It will also bMalayan Unionordinary rosidSingapore.

It will be necessary toarrange for an apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the Government of the straits settlements between the Governments of singapore and of the Malayan Union.Governor- 13. The co-ordination and direction of theGeneral. policies of Government in the Malayan union and Singapore will be among the responsibilities of a Governor-General.AFPBHDIXThe follov/ing are the directions which were given toSir Harold MacMichael for his discussions with the MalayRulers:-&quot;You will visit Malaya, at a date to be agreed bythe S.A.C. S.E.A.., and Invite each Malay Ruler&apos;sco-operation in the establishment of a freshconstitutional organisation of Malaya which hasbeen approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government and communi-cated to you and which is intended to ensure andfacilitiate the progress of the people of the countrytowards unity and ultimate self-government withinthe British Empire.

In furthoranee of this object you are authorised as Special Representative . -of His Majesty&apos;s Government to concludewith each Ruler on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government a formal agreement by which he will cede full jurisdictionto His Majesty in his State.&quot;
