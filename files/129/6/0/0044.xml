SEC RET C.P. (46)  44.6TH FEBRUARY,  1046.cabinet anglo-AMERICAN CIVIL AVIATION DISCUSSIONS&apos;     AT BERMUDAReport &quot;by the Chairman of theCivil Aviation&quot; CommitteeIn accordance with the decision of the Cabinet(CM. (46) 11th Conclusions, Minute 8),  the Civil aviation committee have considered the draft Civil Aviation agreement which has ether god from the Bermuda discussions.2.      At the discussion at the Cabinet the two main stumblingblocks to the acceptance of the Agreement were:- t(a) the unwillingness of the United States Governmentto accept the principle of no change of gauge;    and(b) the proposal that the United Kingdom Governmentshould undertake  to use their good offices to persuade Newfoundland and Canada to agree to american requirements at airfields in newfoundland and Labrador,Since the Cabinet meeting a third point of majordifficulty has orison.    This is a demand put forward by theUnited States Government that they should have a monopoly of the prevision of petrol supplies and services for civil aircraft using the Leased Bases,3,      Change:of Gauge.    If we agreed to change of gauge, a united States &quot;operator running a service,  say from New Yorkto Paris, would be able to bring a load of passengers tothis country in a trans-oceanic aircraft and thereafter carryon those who wished to proceed to Paris or elsewhere in oneor more smaller aircraft.    The fear expressed at the cabinet was that this would enable the American operator to run anunlimited number of smaller aircraft from this country to paris or elsewhere in competition with our air lines,  andthus virtually establish an advanced base here.    Althoughthe interpretation of paragraph 6 of the draft agreementrecommended by the U.K, Delegation (See Appendix IV ofC.P, (46) 37)  is not entirely free from doubt, we believethat on a fair reading of that paragraph it would not bepossible for an American operator to do any such thing,  andthat he would be able to run only enough smaller aircraft to provide accommodation for the passengers brought from theUnited States who wished to go on further.    It would of course be one tn him to fill up any empty seats in the smallerCOPY NO.(THIS DOCUMENT IS TiERi PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S&quot; GOVERNMENT)

aircraft with Fifth Freedom traffic.    We feel, however, thatthis should be made clear beyond doubt, and a telegram isbeing sent to the United Kingdom Delegation at Bermudainstructing them to press for. the insertion in the Agreementof a Clause on the following lines:-&quot;.111 Fifth Freedom traffic shall be.carried in aircraft which started from the- country of origin and in no ether aircraft,except where for convenience or economypermission is given to transfer the passengersof such aircraft to a smaller aircraft, whichpermission will not be unreasonably withheld.&quot;It may be that our Delegation will not be able to securethe insertion of.these words in the Agreement in which case we should be prepared, to recommend the Cabinet to accept theless satisfactory course of embodying the words in an exchangeof letters which could be published along with the Agreement,and form part of the final act.4.      The second and third points referred to in paragraph above are connected with the Leased Bases Agreement,negotiations for which have been proceeding concurrently withthe discussions about the Civil Aviation Agreement.    the americans have pressed that the two Agreements should be linked and the United Kingdom Delegation have recommendedthis.    From our point of view there would be no objection if both agreements were satisfactory, but the Civil aviation committee could not recommend the Cabinet to agree to theinclusion in the Agreement of:-(a) an undertaking that His Majesty&apos;s Government would use their good offices to persuade newfoundland and Canada to agree to American requirements in newfoundland and Labrador:  or(b) a stipulation that all civil aircraft,  includingBritish civil aircraft, using these bases should obtain all their petrol supplies,  spare parts and services from the United States militaryauthorit ies.The Committee understand that these conditions may nothave the support of the State Department and they think thatthe best way of handling this aspect of the matter would beby a direct approach by our Ambassador in Washington toMr. Acheson and. Mr, Clayton,    We have, accordingly agreedthat a telegram should be sent to Lord Halifax asking him tomake it plain that these conditions are quite unacceptableand that we suggest that the U.S. delegation should be askedto withdraw them.    If they are not prepared to do this the ambassador should ask for the support of the State Departmentto the separation of the two Agreements so that the TransportAgreement&quot;already considered by us may be finalised, leaving the Leased Bases for further negotiations.

5.    * At cur meeting three&apos;other new points werementioned which will probably require Ministerialdecision.    They were not however in a form that was appropriate for consideration by the Committee andthere may be additional points.tc come.We therefore recommend that the Committee shouldcontinue to consider proposals beyond those alreadysubmitted to the Cabinet - and where necessary to instruct the U-.K. delegation -; pending a final reportto the Cabinet.(intl&apos;d&apos;d)Cabinet Office, S.W.I.&quot;e th FEBRUARY, 1946.
