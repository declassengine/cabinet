(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E memorandum by Minister of Civil aviation at the end of December, following a series of abortiveattempts to gut together with the United States on the termsof a bilateral Agreement which would govern the civil air transport services of the two countries, the United StatesGovernment proposed that talks on an official level shouldbe held at Bermuda in the immediate future to explore apossible basis for a bilateral civil aviation agreement which would be negotiated subsequently on the Ministerialplane.    The State Department, through Lord Halifax,represented that whilst there was no intention on their part to link civil aviation matters specifically with theLoan Agreements it would greatly facilitate the task of -vsecuring the passage of the Agreements through Congress ifthe outstanding controversial issue of civil aviation couldbe settled, or at least be under negotiation, when theAgreements come before Congress.On this understanding the United Kingdom acceptedthe invitation and talks were begun in Bermuda on the15th January.    The United Kingdom Delegation is led bySir Henry Self and the United States Delegation byMr. Baker, State Department.Soon after the talks began it became apparent that theAmerican Delegation were aiming at reaching an agreement for finalisation and signature at Bermuda.    Pressure to thisend lias been exerted by reference to the effect which the outcome of the talks must have on the Loan debate in Congress.The United Kingdom Delegation left for Bermuda, fullyseized of the importance of their negotiations in relationto the Loan Agreements and of the need for ensuring thatthe difficulties arising from the American charge of inconsistency between our shipping and air policies must be overcome.    Accordingly they were prepared to make any reasonableconcession within the broad framework of our policy,  as itemerged from the Chicago Conference.As my colleagues will be aware the Government policy hasbeen based on recognition of the need for planned developmentof international air transport on an orderly basis, involving the maintenance of close relationship between capacity and.traffic offering on the world&apos;s air routes, equitable divisionof the capacities between countries entitled to operate on aroute,, and the fixing of fares by prior agreement.    TheCP.  (k6) 371ST FEBRUARY,  19h7.COPYCABINETANGLO-AMERICAN CIVIL AVIATION discussions at BERMUDA

application of these principles,  together v/ith any otherfeasible arrangements, is considered essential to the elimination of the wasteful subsidies which were afamiliar feature of pre-v/ar international air transportoperations.    This policy, of which a historical account is given in Appendix 1 of this memorandum, is set forth in the Government White Paper.    It forms the basis of longstanding Commonwealth agreements and has been impressed on foreign countries as part of our campaign to stiffentheir resistance to American attempts to secure unlimitedfreedom of the air.    Moreover this policy is an essential and logical approach to the view held in many quartersregarding the necessity for ultimately placing the world&apos;international air transport under international ownership and operation.    The American philosophy, on the other hand,favours free competition with the minimum of restriction.Prom the purely civil aviation standpoint the reconciliationof the opposing philosophies of the two countries isdifficult, but is further complicated by the wider considerations of shipping policy and the Loan agreement to which I have alluded.The first proposals telegraphed from the United kingdom delegation (Ariel 16 - reproduced as Appendix II), in my view represented, a much too radical departure from our policy acrid would have involved us in too much sacrifice of our civil aviation interests, political difficultyvis-a-vis our declared policy and awkward explanations toour Commonwealth partners,  and especially to Canada v/ithwhom I had concluded an Agreement in strict conformitywith our principles shortly before Christmas.    In short,under these proposals, the Americans offered to acceptthe principle of prior agreement of fares,  subject to theapproval of Governments, but left the regulation of capacity in relation to traffic and the Fifth Freedom issue in such ambiguous terms as to be of no practical value.Accordingly,  after consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, I counter-proposed what I considered to be,  fromthe civil aviation standpoint,  the minimum acceptable terms(see Calib 12 and 1^ - reproduced as Appendix III).    Thesecounter proposals overcome the difficulties of theair/shipping dilemma and take account of the uncertainty ofthe traffic position during the period immediately ahead and of our inability, for another eighteen months, to operateall the capacity we could justify.    Briefly, we proposed:-(l)    A joint Resolution to be incorporated in a FinalAct, embodying (a)  the basic principles of our policy, which Baker and other United StatesDelegates had acknowledged,   (b)  recognition ofthe uncertainties of the North Atlantic trafficpotential in the immediate future,  and agreement to recommend a temporary Agreement for two years(c)    a proposal to negotiate a long term Agreement,in conformity with the agreed principles, tosuperaodo the temporary Agreement, by which timeexperience of North Atlantic operations and statistics of traffic would &quot;be available.

(2)    An Appendix which would contain the provisionsof tixo temporary (two year) Agreement,  tending to give greater definition, hut not rigidity,&apos;to the proposals of the United Kingdom delegation in Appendix II, by fixing a reasonable minimum standard for increasing frequencies, defining the fifth Freedom rights to be granted to United Statesairlines in the United Kingdom, providing for prioragreement on faros and recognising the need for -some adjustment of the services operated by the airlines of the two countries when we roach the stage of having sufficient aircraft to enter thefield on level terms.After several days of intensive negotiations,  the UnitedKingdom Delegation,  on the basis of the approach contained inour counter proposals, have reached an agreement which theystrongly recommend us to accept.    Their proposals andexplanations are contained in Ariel telegrams 26 to 3h,which are too lengthy to reproduce.    The provisions of theResolution, Agreement and Appendix are set out in Appendix IV,These telegrams roise an issue of fundamental importance tothe future development of British air transport, but bothDelegations are urging acceptance and finalisation of theAgreements at Bermuda.    The United Kingdom delegation argue that the Americans have made considerable advances towards *meeting our views, while the United States Delegation pointout that there is dissension in the ranks of their delegatesever the concessions they consider they have already madeana that if the Delegations disperse without signing theAgreement the dissident minority may well mobilise powerfulopposition to subsequent ratification.    Lord Halifax sharesoil 3.3 view.There are thus two  questions for the decision of mycello agues.(i)   Whether the agreed proposals now submitted to both Governments,  and endorsed by the /jnoricanGovernment,  should be accepted,    and(2)    Whether &quot;:.e United Kingdom Delegation should beempowered to sign the Agreement before my colleague;have had an opportunity to consult with them andwith commonwealth  /ealth countries who have been,throughout, united with us in the support ofour policy.(1) the proposals contained in Ariel telegram?:pear superficially to concede the essence of28,OU    basis

provisions in the resolution, which is to be construed as pert of the Agreement, that the two Governments will-oporato in order to ensure that the principle ofmaintaining close relationship between total capacity and total traffic on a route is observed arid, further,  thatthey will ensure that our conditions of the grant of FifthFreedom are applied.    Thus the operators of the two countriesarc free to operate as many frepuencies as they wish onthe various routes connecting American and United Kingdomterritories subject to the undertakings&apos;of the two governments to observe certain principles which can only be arjpliedex post facto.There is first the practical difficulty,  in the absenceof any yardstick, of ensuring the application of theprinciple relating capacity to traffic.    Either or bothoperators may be inflating their capacity but no criterionfor judging this has been laid down.    Then there is thesecond, and more important, difficulty that the United states authorities at present have no power of control over the capacity which their international operators may placeupon a route.The United Kingdom Delegation recognise these difficulties and rely on continuous and effective inter-governmentalcollaboration and, in the last analysis, on the applicationof the sanction of revocation of permit,  as provided inArticle 6 of the agreement (Ariel 30).    Past experience hasshown that the application of this last extreme&quot;&quot; steppresents great political difficulty and the applicationof a penalty is inherently an unsatisfactory substitute for lack of definition in an agreement.In practice the proposals depend for their effectivenesson co-operation and goodwill between operators,  since theUnited States Government has no power, at present, toimpose its will.    In this connection, past experience is notencouraging,  as was recently exemplified by the P.;h.A.&quot;cut rate&quot; incident.    The B. 0.    C,  representatives, whoare advisers to the Delegation, obviously fear thisfundamental weakness of the proposals and have represented that they would be exposed to the full blast of Americancompetition from which, under their present handicaps,recovery would be long and difficult.These proposals have formed the subject of interdepartmentalconsideration,  and it was suggested to me that if theUnited States Delegation is prepared to seek statutory powersto fix fair and economic rates they should, also be preparedto take power to ensure the observance by operators of theprinciples to which the United States Government wouldsubscribe in the Resolution.    In particular power to regulate the capacity which operators should place on a route willbe necessary.    Given that the United States Government would,and could, obtain this power I should feel more easilyreconciled to the acceptance of the agreement.    But, as atpresent drawn, the onus of responsibility is placed on twoGovernments to ensure that it is carried out in accordancewith the principles to which they subscribe, but principles which one of them has not the legal power to enforce.    Failingthat power,  I con only repeat that from the civil aviationstandpoint, the acceptance of the proposals would in effect-IP-

commit us to free enterprise, without any guarantee ofGovernment regulation,  in place of the policy v/e havehitherto advocated of planned development on anon-restrictive, but well ordered, basis.    I should perhapsadd that in the absence of effective control over thetotal capacity required to carry the traffic on a givenroute, the value of American acceptance of our principlesof Fifth Freedom would be seriously undermined and the dangers of wasteful subsidisation increased.I have telegraphed to the United Kingdom Delegationexpressing the substance of the foregoing views and asking them to test the reactions of the United States delegation to the suggestion that they should take statutory powerto control capacity employed by operators as well asto fix fair and economic rates.    If this suggestionproves acceptable I should regard the proposals as acceptablethough still less satisfactory than I would have wished.If it is rejected I should not feel in a defensible position from tiie purely civil aviation standpoint.    At the same time fully realise that if it is believed that the failure to reach agreement may imperil the Lean prospects i must of course accept the disabilities of which I havespoken being inflicted upon civil aviation.    My proposals in Appendix II do,  I consider,  give us a clear defence asregards shipping and I do not regard that as a live issue in the context of the decision for which I now ask mycolleagues.With regard to the question whether our delegation should sign the Agreement before leaving Bermuda, I feelthat a decision depends whether my colleagues are preparedto   ceept the proposals as they now stand.    If theUnited States Delegation are prepared to accept thesuggestion I have made for investing Civil AeronauticsBoard with powers to control capacity I should see noobjection,   as Minister of Civil Aviation,  to finalisingthe Agreement.As these proposals represent a fundamental departure from the policy which has hitherto been common groundamong Commonwealth countries,  arrangements have been madefor securing their views in order to facilitate a decision whether the Agreements should be finalised at Bermuda,W.Ariel House,Strand, w, C. 2.1ST FEBRUARY,  19^6,

APPENDIX I217ANGLO-AMERICAN CIVIL AVIATION discussions at BERMUDABACKGROUNDShortly after the present Government came into power they decided to adopt the international civil aviation policy oftheir predecessors,  (CAC(45)3),    This policy was designed topromote planned and orderly development of the world&apos;international air transport and to&quot; eliminate the wastefulcompetition and subsidy warfare which had led to much inter-national friction before the war.    Two Committees, one under sir Francis Shelmerdine and one under Lord Finlay, had earlierreported in favour of international ownership and operationof the world&apos;s international routes.     Few countries ofimportance were prepared to surrender their rights of independentoperation and the solution recommended by the Shelmerdineand Finlay Reports was considered premature.      Instead, theGovernment decided to adopt a policy which aimed at establishingan International Organisation with effective powers to regulateinternational air transport development in accordance with thefollowing principles:-(l)    The maintenance of equilibrium between capacity and traffic offering on a route;(2)    The division of capacity between countries operating on the route in proportion to the trafficembarked in their territories (i.e, upliftirrespective of nationality);(3)    Fares and freight rates to be laid down;(4)    Elimination of unecamic subsidies.    (Theapplication of principles (i) to (3) would go far to achieve this object, but ratefixing, by itself,  would not).2*      If an International Convention could be establishedsetting up such an organisation^  the U.K. were prepared to grontFreedoms 1 to 4 on a multilateral basis.    The Fifth Freedomwas considered to be inherently too complex to administer on a multilateral basis to cover conditions varying between theextremes of the intensive competition of Europe and the comparatively poorly served areas of South America,    This was left to be separately negotiated by bilateral Agreements.3,     All Commonwealth Governments subscribed to this policy atthe London conversations of 1943 and again at Montreal inOctober, 1944.4,      Attempts to secure its acceptance at Chicago failed chieflybecause the Americans sought to include in the Convention (0) thegrant of unregulated Fifth Freedom (the right to carry trafflo .not originating in or destined for home territory), and (b) theprinciple of escalation (right of successful operator to increasehis capacity to meet public preference for his airline), - to beapplied even to Fifth Freedom traffic.    The U.K. were prepared togrant Fifth Freedom rights to permit filling of vacant spacearising incidentally to operation on a Third Freedom basis(capacity required to carry home-embarked traffic to variousdestinations) and to allow escalation on Third Freedom, but noton Fifth Freedom, traffic.    The Conference broke on these issues.

5.      Subsequently,  all Commonwealth countries decided toadopt a standard form of bilateral Agreement embodying the principles for which they had contended unsuccessfullyat Chicago.    Provision for escalot ion was excluded.Copies of this Agreement hove been circulated to Governmentsthroughout Europe,  the Middle East and South America asexemplifying the type of Agreement we would wish tonegotiate with them.      It has been used as the basis ofour campaign to stiffen resistance to American attempts to secure unlimited rights in European and Middle Eastcountries and has formed the basis of the recently concluded Agreements with Greece.  Portugal and Canada.6.      Early in August, 1945,  informal conversations at theofficial level took place with Messrs.  Clayton and StokeleyMorgan of the State Department.    These conversationsyielded no results.    Both sides restated their policies and,   if anything,  receded from the advances both had madeat Chicago as regards Fifth Freedom.7*      In September, 1945, the IT, S.  Government in anticipation of the forthcoming start of their airline services re-opened the question through Mr. Winant.    In consultationwith the Foreign Secretary I drew up as a basis of negotiation a statement of Heads of Agreement, which mr. Winant took to Washington.      These Heads of agreement were framed largely on the basis of the final British planput forward at Chicago and, although provision forescalation was not  included, they offered Fifth Freedomrights in the U.E.  on a limited basis,  not of on arithmeticalformula, but of a flexible code of principles similar tothose applied by the Civil Aeronautics Board of the U.S.A.in adjudicating upon applications for licences to operatedomestic airlines.    Certain other concessions to the U. 8.point of view were made,  e. g. stop over facilities onthrough tickets.     These Heads of Agreement were rejectedand our request for counter-proposals met with no response.Nevertheless, we allowed U, S. airlines to start services tothis country and endeavoured to reach a temporary agreement for this purpose pending negotiation of a long-termbilateral Agreement.    The negotiations for a temporaryAgreement were interrupted by the P.A.A.  &quot;cut&quot; rate incident.This attempt unilaterally to impose an uneconomic fare in defiance of the recommendations of the International air transport Association (an Association of internationaloperators of which P.A.A. Is a member) was successfully resisted by reducing the P.A.A. frequencies and they were forced to conform with the rate considered appropriate byother North Atlantic operators.    Each of the two Americanoperators is at present allowed to operate 7 services a week to this country within a maximum capacity of 500 seats a week,although the only Agreement we have with the U.S., which was concluded in 1937,  only permits of two services a week.During this troubled period the U. 3. Government urgedon one or two occasions thfrt I should proceed to washington to negotiate a bilateral Agreement, but, with the fullapproval of my colleagues, I felt unable to comply until itcould be shown, through exploratory conversations at theofficial level, that there were reasonable prospects of concluding an Agreement.

3,      The position is further complicated by wider considerations of policy.   During the Loan negotiations in Washington the Americans att empted, without success,to make the conclusion of a civil aviation agreement acondition of the Loan.    Then again, they have drawn attention   to a divergence between our shipping and air transport policies.     In shipping we are opposed toregulation   of capacity and the Americans claim that if our air policy is to be adopted they would propose to reserve 50% of American exports for carriage in Americanbottoms.    Whilst the analogy can be disproved it is sufficiently close to be embarrassing.      It was accordinglyconsidered what we should concede the principle of escalation,but not so expressed,  in our Air Agreement in order tocbsolve us of any charge that we were preventing the successfuloperator from carrying all the traffic he could attract.9.      It was against this somewhat confused background that theAmerican proposal was made in December that exploratory conversations at the official level, for the sole purpose of finding if a basis for the negotiation of an Agreementexisted,  should take place in Bermuda,  preferably beforethe Loan proposals came before Congress.    The intention wasto attempt to find such a common basis with a view to negotiation of an Agreement at Ministerial level.APPENDIX united KINGDOM DELEGATION TQ BERMUDA CIVIL AVIATIONCONFERENCE TO MINISTRY OP CIVIL AVIATIONNo.  16 ARIEL D. 4.41 p.m.  20th January,  1946,21st January,  1946 R.  In Admiralty 3.57 a.m.21st January, 1946.Repeated to 3.A.D.  WashingtonIMMEDIATEFollowing from United Kingdom Delegation for Ministry ofCivil Aviation and Foreign Office.    Space distribution.    my immediately preceding telegram.    You will have seen from the daily Delegation Reports that we have forcibly presented.United Kingdom case under the three heads of:(a)    Rate Oontrolro)    Capacity Control and(c)    Grant of Fifth Freedom privileges.United States Delegation have made it abundantly clear that fortheir part, their basic philosophy on these three issues has not changed.2.     On (a)    they have argued that  the whole economic philosophyof the United States of America is in favour of free enterprise and is against control except \fiere the need for control in thepublic interest has been overwhelmingly $roved.    They have also pointed out that Congress specifically refused the C.A.B. some little time ago, authoritsr to fix fares to be charged by UnitedStates operators on international routes.    Naturally we have not allowed these arguments to pass unchallenged and we have not beenslow to boint out in informal discussion that the recent P.A.A.case provides abundant proof of the need for governmental controlof fares.

3.     As for (Id) above, the United States delegationhave argued forcibly that in the present developmentalstage of air transport the operators must be free todecide what number of frequencies they will operate onany particular route, and they have pointed out that allpast experience goes to show that the provision of facilities creates traffic which would never be attractedto the air at all if the operator was stopped from puttingon additional capacity until a . 70 per cent load factorhad been obtained.    There is no doubt that  in north america this is in fact what has happened.4..     As for (c ) above, i. e, . the grant of fifth freedom,the United States Delegation has stressed that theUnited States operators are responsible to their share-holders and cannot afford to operate long distanceservices merely to try and exploit local traffic   between,for example, London and Brussels.    Moreover, the operatorshove made it clear that they would in fact operate onthe telescope principle even if they enjoyed unlimitedfifth freedom rights at all points on the route.5,     This in its broadest terms is the position reached in the official discussions of the rates and trafficcommittee.    There can be no doubt that for us now merely to restate our principles would lead directly to a break-down.    Baker has made it clear more than once that if this happened (leaving out of account the loan discussions andother phases of Anglo United States relations) the UnitedStates would certainly insist on the application of thesame principles to shipping.      We have always taken theline, that the circumstances in shipping and the air arenot analagous but the Americans clearly are not convinced of this    and   have, no   intention of dealing with themseparately.    We, for our part, have no intention of.surrendering what we believe to be right in the air, butwe feel bound,  in view of the great importance attaching to British shipping,  to which our attention was drawnbefore our departure, to draw attention to these clearstatements of facts by Baker.6.      Situation now reached has been fully discussed inunofficial talks with members of United States delegation.With so many conflicting forces at work within the UnitedStates delegation, there may easily be an overnight volteface but it appears that agreement might be arrived atbroadly on the following lines:(a)    Control of fares - Baker, Welch Pogueand Morgan have indicated privatelythat, in their view, we have made out a strong case for governmental control ofratea*      C.A.B. are clearly nervousthat they may be severely criticised in the United States of America, ifthey concede this and a good dealturns on the view taken by Harlee Branch,fourth member of the C.A.B. who has just arrived.      If he sides with Pogue,all should be well.

(b) Regulation of capacity - Baker feels that united States delegation could not secure United States agreement to anystrict measure of government control.He feels that given rate control,capacity control is of less significance.He is prepared to subscribe to the doctrine that the ideal is equilibriumbetween capacity and traffic offeringand is quite willing that it should be stated that the primary object ofLonghaul services should be to provideconnexion with the countries of ultimatedestination, namely a third and fourthfreedom concept.    He added that of course it would be the same for all and thatthe amount of capacity operated wouldbe on a fifty-fifty basis.(c) As regards fifth freedom,  it  is quite clearthat a refusal to grant any fifth freedomwould wreck the conference.    At the sametime the Americans are clearly anxiousto make some concession to our point ofview in order to secure agreement, andhave instanced the provision in the draftFrench agreement that either contracting party could cancel the grant of fifthfreedom rights at any point on a throughroute (on six months notice.    As acorroilory to this and with a view tosafeguarding the position of the other party who might find the provisionsof the agreement being whittled awayone by one,  the draft also provides thatthe other party would in these circumstanceshave the option of cancelling the entire agreement,      The following three paragraphsreproduce the text of a rough document which the United States have given us as a basis for discussion.    Passages In brackets have been added by us.(l)    Each of the two contracting partiesundertakes in the establishment andtechnical and commercial operation by itsair lines of the long range servicesdescribed in paragraphs A and B of thepresent annex on routes,  not now served by its air lines,  that the interests ofthe air lines of the other contracting party shall be taken into considerationso as not to affect unduly the services which the latt er perform on all or part ofthe same routes.      In case one of the contracting parties considers that theinterests of one of its air lines areunduly affected,  it will inform theother contracting party which, afterconsultation, will take all appropriatesteps to give effect to the foregoing provisions.

(2)   Regarding the right of the air lines ofeach country to e nib ark and disembark,in the cities and on the routesoutlined in paragraphs A and E of thepresent line,  passengers,  mail and goods destined to or coming from third countries,  it  is understood that this right is accorded with a view topermitting economical operation of thelong range services performed by thesaid air lines,  such services to retainas their primary objective the connexionbetween the country of which each airline    is a national and the country of ultimate destination.(5)    If it should appear that (the exercise of)the&apos;right in question at any pointor points is incompatible with theprinciples mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs,  either of the contracting parties would have (theright to consult with the other witha view to the situation being remedied,if necessary by arbitration or) the option of cancelling, upon six months&apos;notice, the reciprocal exercise ofthat right,  the other contracting partyhaving in that case, the option of Kcancelling the entire present  agreement on a like notice of six months.7,     Welch Pogue has volunteered statement that in examining the capacity operated on any given route in order to decide whether a particular operator was being reasonable ornot he would expect a load factor of 65 per cent or 70 percent to be taken as the determining factor and that the load factor should not in fact be lower than 60 per centeven in the cose of promotional services.   Your detailedcomments on this draft document are contained in my nextsucceeding telegram.

The proposals insofar as they relate to capacityfrequencies and Fifth Freedom do not seem to differmaterially from the agreement the Americans have concluded with Prance.    The proposals do not constitute an agreement in definite terms and insofar as they purport to include certain principles of our policy lack sufficient definitiontc form a practicable basis of arbitration on which weshould have to rely for protection against Americaninterpretation as compared with ours,    What for example isto be the critical, rion of whether the services of one country&quot;unduly&quot; affect the services of the other and if theparties do net agree by what standard would any arbitratorjudge.5.      Nevertheless I recognise that the difficulty of reconciling cur divergent shipping and air policies anathe wider political considerations involved make itdesirable to endeavour to frame counter proposals around the American proposals.    In making my counter proposals  have in mind the following considerations:(1)    that we were prepared to concede the principleof escalation;(2)    that the uncertain North Atlantic trafficpotential for the next year or two, would make it difficultto pre-deter-mine capacity and we should have to proceed on the basis of trial and. error;(3)    that we are unlikely to be in a position totake up our share of the traffic for the next 18 months evenif we do purchase a few American aircraft,h.      Accordingly unless you sew strong objection you.should endeavour (a)  to secure recognition in a resolution in the proposal Final Act of the principles of our policy

which according to your telegram Baker and others haveacknowledged., and (b) to negotiate a temporary agreement on a flexible basis for a period of two years only, thisAgreement to be replaced by a long term Agreement whenmore experience has been gained on operating the Atlanticroutes and of the actual traffics offering for conveyanceby. air.    The lines of such a Resolution and the matters for inclusion in a temporary Agreement are outlined inmy next following telegram.    In presenting these counter-proposals you will no doubt explain that the suggestedadditions to the Agreement are designed to give greaterprecision to their proposals.5,      Ay proposals have not (repeat not) been consideredby other Ministers and I should like to know the Americanreaction to them..^CYPHER7 SPECIAL (CIVIL AVIATION)FROM MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION TO UNITEDKINGDOM DELEGATION TO BERMUDACIVIL AVIATION CONFERENCENo.  &quot;13 CALIB D,  10.0 p*mt  22nd January, 1946.22nd January,  19u7,MOST IMMEDIATETOP SECRETFollowing are lines of proposed resolution and provisions for temporary Agreement,A.

For this purpose the capacityof the services is to be regarded as the capacity required to carry the traffic over thegoverning trans-Atlantic stage.    (The limitationof Fifth Freedom to 50,j of frequencies is onarbitrary estimate of capacity between theUnited States and onward destinations based
