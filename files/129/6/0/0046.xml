THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 46.Qth February, 1946.CABINET.PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET REPORTS OF THE SELECTCOMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE following notice of motion has been on the order paper of the Houseof Commons in the names of Mr. Clement Davies and Mr. Stokes since october last National Expenditure Committee (Memoranda) That all memorandaaddressed by the Select Committees on National Expenditure in Sessions1939-40 to 1944-45, inclusive, to the Prime Minister for consideration of theWar Cabinet, be laid on the Table of this House.2. The orders of reference of the Select Committee contained the followingclause : That the Committee have power, in cases where considerations ofnational security preclude the publishing of certain recommendations andof the arguments upon which they are based, to address a memorandum tothe Prime Minister for the consideration of the War Cabinet, provided thatthe Committee shall, whenever they have exercised such power, report thefact as soon as possible to the House.3. Under this authority, the Committee presented in all ten reports to thePrime Minister.  A list is attached to this paper.   (Appendix.)4. Although the notice of motion is in general terms as regards these reports, there is no doubt that the desire to secure publication is restricted tothe report of the 9th March, 1944, on tank production, and I suggest that thequestion we should consider is whether that particular report should be published.5. It is a report of some twenty-three pages of type, containing strong-criticism of British tank design, production and performance and of theorganisation responsible in the Ministry of Supply and War Office. the coalition Government^ reply (which would have to be published if the report,is published) was about half the length of the report.6. There are arguments for and against publication applicable to all theseten reports. In favour of publication, it can be urged that it is desirable thatcriticisms of a responsible body against the Government of the day should be made known to the public. Neither Ministers nor high military officers and CivilServants should be led to think that their shortcomings can for ever remain undera veil of secrecy. Security considerations and the state of war rendered publica-tion undesirable at the time. But no security objection can be raised (I am advised) to the publication of these reports now the war is over.7. Against publication, the argument is that these reports were compiledand presented as secret reports. Much of the evidence on which they were basedwas probably given under an assurance of secrecy. They were produced specific-ally for the consideration of the War Cabinet and have a status analogous to thatof Cabinet papers. Moreover, even if it is argued that the reasons for secrecyhave disappeared here, the disclosure after an interval of two years of information given on the understanding of secrecy may adversely affect the securing of secret information in any future enquiry, should there be one, of an analogous nature.[31265]
8. Besides these general arguments, there are considerations peculiar to thisparticular report. Tank production was a matter of wide public interest and much concern during the war... There were lessons learned which should not be lost, and refusal to publish will not be readily acceptable to Parliament. some public interest still continues, as is evidenced by correspondence in The Timesearly last month following an article on heavy tanks in modern warfare.9. But, on the other side, it can be said that a good deal of the ground wastraversed in the secret debate in the House of Commons on the 24th March, 1944,and is therefore known to members of the last Parliament. Also, it is Open to question whether it is wise to parade controversial criticisms of British militaryand productive efficiency in the eyes of the world, particularly America and russia.10. I submit the question of publication to the Cabinet for decision. my own feeling is in favour of publication for the reason given in paragraph 6 above.If, however, we decide to publish it is for consideration whether Mr. Churchill,to whom the report was presented, should not be given an opportunity of addinga further reply bringing that sent to the Committee up to date; such a coursewould, however, involve delay and Mr. Stokes is beginning to press.&apos; 11. As regards the remaining nine reports, I suggest that we should waitand see whether pressure to publish them develops. It should, however, be on record, in case the question of publication should subsequently arise, that thereport of the 17th May, 1940, on Light Alloys contains a number of personalreferences, and confidential information which may make it unsuitable for publication whatever may be decided about publication of the other reports.H.
