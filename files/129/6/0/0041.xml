HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)JLJUULiLT ^  &quot;     242CP. (46) 41 COPY NO^4TH FEBRUARY,  1946.CABINETTIMBER FOR housing memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the timber of particular importance for housing issoftwood.     Departmental estimates of total requirements in1946 amounted to 1,500,000 standards, including 760,000 for building, while our estimates of available supplies are1,280,000.      A statement in more detail is appended.2.      Since these estimates of requirements were made, theChairman of the Materials Committee, which allocates suppl.   samong the various uses, has held a meeting with representa- .vesof the Housing Departments to review the estimates of requ: *e-ments.     I am informed that, having regard to current   -consumption and  the labour likely to be available,  i t is r vestimated that, requirements for building should be reduced   to655,000 standards and total requirements to 1,305,000standards,3.      On this basis - and provided the licensing of timber is strictly phased by using Departments to ensure that timber isnot drawn by contractors before it is needed - estimates ofsupplies and demands are sufficiently close.4.      I should draw attention,  however,  to two manoruncertainties in the estimates of supplies.(a)    One is that production has to be switched from thiscountry, where  the standing timber is approachingexhaustion,  to Germany where there are ample suppliesbut the difficulties of producing and bringing themforward are great.      Arrangements    have now beencompleted for strengthening the Control Commissiontimber organisation in the British Zone withorganising staff and equipment, under Sir GeraldLenanton,  the present Director of Production inthis   &quot;ountry.      The Control Commission are fullyalive to the importance of the matter, but untilexperience has been gained of a timber drive inGermany it is not possible to say with assurance that even the comparatively modest estimate of results in 1946 will be attained.

R.S.C.Board of Trade,  S.V. 1.4JTH FEBRUARY,  1946.(b)    A second and more immediate difficulty is that wehave been s3riously warned by the Swedish Governmentthat unless they can be assured of substantiallyi nc r ea sed supplies of coal they will be obliged to direct their available labour to cutting wood forfuel instead of for export.    The Ministry of fuel and Power  have agreed to meet the Swedes early thismonth when it was hoped to give them a definiteindication of what coal the U.K. would be able tosupply.      But I understand that there are diffi-culties in the way of making any considerable quantity of coal available to Sweden from thiscountry, and that the prospects of the EuropeanGoal Organisation allocating increased supplies to Sweden from the Ruhr or elsewhere are alsouncertain.      The Swedes have indicated  that for practical pur-poses they must take a definite decision in the course of the next week or two.Similar difficulties over coal arise in Finland.5. ,   Our difficulties over timber are all the greater because it has been impossible to bring the Soviet Government to enterinto discussions for the supply of timber from Sovietterritories, which before the war were very large exportersto this country,      I am following this matter up withMr. Vyshinsky and Mr. Sergeev who are now here.6.      It will be seen that  the most urgent matters upon whicha decision is required is-whether sufficient supplies ofcoal can be made available for Sweden to secure the 200,000standards of timber for which we have budgeted from thatcountry.      The quantity of  coal would no   doubt have to bea matter for discussion.      In December the Swedes put forward a figure of 3,600,000 tons in the coming twelve months fromthis country and the Ruhr.      It was indicated to them at thetime that this was quite unrealistic but I do not think we can expect to get timber from them unless we can offer them an appreciable quantity of coal from this country - say half amillion  to one million tons.      I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that everything possible should be done to makecoal available now to Sweden,  so that we can obtain thenecessary timber from them.7.      I should add that similar considerations apply in regardto mining timber.      It has recently been agreed that we shall continue to produce as much as practicable in  this country,in spite of the inroads this will make upon our growing trees.But we need also the largest possible supplies not only fromGermany, but also from Finland and Scandinavia, where itsproduction competes with the cutting of wood for fuel.
