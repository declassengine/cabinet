THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      J 9Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. Copy No,CP. (46) 6.8th January, 1946.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL.TRUSTEESHIP SYSTEM FUTURE of territories NOW HELD UNDER UNITED KINGDOM MANDATE.Memorandum by the Acting Chairman of the Colonial Affairs Committee.1. I circulate a memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. an earlier draft of this memorandum was considered by the Colonial Affairs Com-mittee at their meeting on Monday, the 7th January, when I presided in theabsence of the Lord Privy Seal. The version now circulated incorporates theviews of the Colonial Affairs Committee and is submitted for Cabinet approval.2.   The main recommendations in the memorandum are : (i) that(a) the African mandated territories (Tanganyika, Togoland andCameroons) should be placed under Trusteeship, provided that satisfactory Trusteeship agreements can be negotiated;(b) steps should be taken to recognise the independent status of Trans-J ordan;(c) action in regard to Palestine should be deferred pending the reportof the Anglo-American Commission (paragraph 5);(ii) that Tanganyika, Togoland and Cameroons should not be designated asstrategic areas (paragraph 3);(iii) that the draft Trusteeship Agreement at Annex III to the memorandum should be approved as a basis for international negotiation for the african mandated territories and should be circulated to DominionGovernments forthwith (pararaph 8-11);&apos;.&apos; (iv) that this draft should be sent for observations to the Belgian Govern-ment in respect of Tanganyika and to the French Government inrespect of Cameroons and Togoland, with copies for information tothe other &quot; Big Five&quot; members, and to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations Organisation (paragraph 19);(y) that the Union of South Africa must also be regarded as directly con-cerned in the future of our mandated territories in Africa and shouldalso receive a copy of the draft for its observations (paragraph 20);(vi) that an appropriate statement should be made at the earliest suitablemoment at the forthcoming session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations (paragraph 22);(vii) that a similar statement of policy should be made in Parliament as soon.as it reassembles (paragraph 23).3. The Committee also agreed that the terms of the proposed statement tothe General Assembly should be forwarded to Dominion Governments for their observations, and that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should undertakeany necessary consultations regarding the terms of the announcement with the governors of the territories concerned. In view of the short time available action is being jtaken on ]this conclusion in advance of the Cabinet Meeting and it istherefore not specifically referred to in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum.[31130] b
4 The Committee further agreed that a Note should be sent to the Unionof South Africa with regard to Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s suggested^ion tha Tangan-yika should be specified as a &quot; Strategic Area and that the Note should set outthe reasons why this was undesirable.(Initialled) A.Dominions Office,8th January, 1946.II.INTERNATIONAL TRUSTEESHIP SYSTEM:  FUTURE  OF TERRI-TORIES NOW HELD UNDER UNITED KINGDOM MANDATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Previous consideration by Cabinet.1. At their meeting on the 20th December* the Gabinet considered my paper CP. (45) 342 proposing that His Majesty&apos;s Government should declaretheir intention of placing our mandated territories (with the exception of Trans-Jordan) under the International Trusteeship System. The Cabinet decided to defer their decision until the views of the Dominions and of the Chiefs of staff had been obtained.Consultation with Commonwealth Governments.2. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has sought the views ofDominion Governments on the proposal that an announcement of our intentionsshould be made during the First Part of the First Session of the general assembly. Australia has not yet replied, but the replies of Canada, New zealand and South Africa are reproduced in Annex I and may be summarised asfollows:&apos; -(a) Canada.The Canadian Government agree with the proposal that we should takethe initiative by making such a statement at this time and feel that it wouldmake a good impression in the United States and elsewhere.(b) New Zealand.The Prime Minister, who is now in London, has made the following comments s (i) African Mandates. He warmly welcomes the decision to placeTanganyika, Cameroons and Togoland under Trusteeship.(ii) Samoa. He proposes to restate to the General Assembly theintention of the New Zealand Government to place WesternSamoa under Trusteeship.(iii) Palestine. He agrees with the course proposed in CP. (45) 342.(iv) Trans-Jordan. He   considers   that   the   Mandate   should   be terminated and that an application for membership of the united nations Organisation by Trans-Jordan should be supported bythe members of the British Commonwealth,(v) Nau-ru. He suggests that, at the same time as the announcement about the United Kingdom mandated territories, the UnitedKingdom, Australian and New Zealand Governments shoulddeclare their intention to place Nauru under Trusteeship.(c) The Union of South A frica.The Union Government express deep concern about the strategic position on the eastern side of Africa and refer to possible future dangers in theIndian Ocean arising from changes  emerging in the  area  from  the* CM. (45) 64th Conclusions, Item 4.
Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf and in India. They consider Tanganyikaa vital link in the African line of communications and security. they therefore suggest (as mentioned above) that it should be reserved as a strategic area &apos;&apos; and that it would be appropriate for the United Kingdom,and possibly the Union, to have the same strategic position in Tanganyikaas the United States in the vital Pacific Islands. The Union Governmentconclude by requesting that the strategic position should be considered andthat there should be further consultation before a final decision is taken.(It may be added that the Union Government are reluctant to place South-West Africa under Trusteeship.)i!    (d) India.The Secretary of State for India has also consulted the Government ofIndia, who have no comments to make.Consultation with Chiefs of Staff.3. Meanwhile, the Chiefs of Staff have also considered the implications ofthe proposal to place our African mandated territories under Trusteeship. Theydo not consider that the strategic importance of Togoland and the Cameroonsis sufficient to justify the designation of these territories as strategic areas. Asregards Tanganyika, they have taken into consideration the views of the Unionof South Africa (referred to in paragraph 2 (c) above), together with certainpolitical arguments against the designation of this territory which I felt itdesirable to bring to their notice. After full consideration of all these factors,the Chiefs of Staff have advised as follows : &quot; There are military arguments both for and against designatingTanganyika as a strategic area, the arguments against such a step being, if anything, stronger. It is appreciated that the political disadvantages of sodesignating the area are considerable, and we, therefore, conclude that,i:; having regard both to the military and political factors, Tanganyika shouldnot be designated a strategic area.&quot;My colleagues will presumably accept this advice.The political arguments referred to above may be briefly summarised asfollows : (a) Designation as a stoategic area would not affect the military provisionsof the Trusteeship Agreement, but only the nature and extent of&apos; international supervision. A strategic area would be under the super-vision of the Security Council instead of the Trusteeship Council andGeneral Assembly.(&amp;) The Security Council, by its nature, would be likely to devote more,rather than less, attention to military matters than the other bodies,and the other members of the &quot; Big Five &quot; would have a right of veto.(c) It would be politically inappropriate to remove nearly six million nativeinhabitants from the direct jurisdiction of the Trusteeship Council.(d) The precedent of declaring Tanganyika a strategic area might lead to similar action in respect of almost every other mandated territory,thus nullifying the original spirit of the trusteeship system.The Present International Position;4. We are on the eve of the first session of the United Nations general assembly. In bringing the Trusteeship issue before the Cabinet again I wishto focus attention particularly on the line which will have to be taken by theUnited Kingdom Delegation at the Assembly. The International trusteeship system is a feature of the United Nations Organisation in which Great Britain,as the greatest Colonial and Mandatory Power, is specially concerned, and itseems inevitable that the United Kingdom Delegation should come forward at anearly stage in the proceedings of the Assembly with a clear statement of our policy and intentions in this context. The trend of discussions in the PreparatoryCommission has impressed on me the urgent necessity of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment keeping the initiative in Trusteeship matters, particularly the future of the mandated territories. We have been under heavy pressure in the PreparatoryCommission, particularly from the U.S.S.R. and their associated States, who have endeavoured to create the impression that we (and, to a lesser extent, the other
Mandatory Powers) are reluctant to bring our mandated territories under the trusteeship system. My colleagues will also, no doubt, have noticed in the press reports of articles which appeared in Soviet periodicals shortly before the Moscow-Conference sharply criticising British Colonial policy. The Preparatory Corn-mission has recommended that the General Assembly should pass a resolution inthe following terms : &apos;&apos; The General Assembly of the United Nations calls on the Statesadministering territories in accordance with the League of Nations mandatesto undertake practical steps, in concert with the other States directly con-cerned, for the implementation of the provisions of Article 79 of the Charterproviding for the conclusion of the agreements on Trusteeship terms for each territory to be placed under the Trusteeship system, in order to submit these agreements for approval preferably not later than the second Part of theFirst Session of the General Assembly.&quot; .I therefore regard it as most important that we should be in a position to showthat, so far from acting under pressure, we are taking the lead in practical application of the Trusteeship system. To do so might, moreover, help tostrengthen our position in the Assembly generally by illustrating our constructiveefforts to make the United Nations Organisation a success.Proposals for each mandated territory.5. In considering the details of what can be said and done, our mandated territories can be divided naturally into two groups : (i) The Middle Eastern Mandates.(a) Palestine.The position has already been made clear in Parliament by the foreign secretary&apos;s statement of policy last November regarding the Anglo-AmericanCommission of Enquiry, and can be restated in the Assembly. We canquite reasonably take the line that we are not able for the moment to takepractical steps towards placing Palestine under Trusteeship.(b) Trans-Jordan.I have given further consideration to this question and I how consider,for the reasons summarised in Annex II, that it would be undesirable and indeed impracticable to attempt to place Trans-Jordan under Trusteeship. and that the only satisfactory course is to take steps to establish its inde-pendence within its present frontiers. This would involve negotiating anew treaty with Trans-Jordan containing defence and other provisions satis-factory to ourselves, and I have little doubt, in fact, that such a treaty canbe negotiated. If the Cabinet approve in principle, I propose to ask theChiefs of Staff forthwith to consider what military provisions (compatible with the independent status of Trans-Jordan) should be included in thenew treaty. However, it would naturally be most unwise to mention this in public as a &quot;condition&quot; of Trahs-Jordan&apos;s independence. If this isto be our policy, then we have clearly everything to gain from announcingit at the earliest appropriate moment in the General Assembly. I therefore propose that the following passage should be included in our statement tothe Assembly about the future of our mandated territories : 1&quot; With reference to Trans-Jordan, it is the intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to take steps in the near future for establishingthis territory as a sovereign independent State and for recognising itsstatus as such. His Highness the Amir Abdullah has accepted an invitation-tation-to come to London for discussions to this end. In these circum-stances the question of placing Trans-Jordan under Trusteeship does notarise.&quot;(ii) The African Mandates.I recommend that we should inform the Assembly that, subject to agreement on satisfactory terms of Trusteeship, we desire.to place Tanganyika, Oameroonsand Togoland&quot; under Trusteeship. I further recommend that, by adopting thenrocedure described in the following paragraphs of this memorandum, we should put ourselves in a position to demonstrate that we have already taken all the
initial steps that are in our power towards doing so. It will then be clear thatthe responsibility for any further delay in the negotiations will rest somewhereelse than on His Majesty&apos;s Government.Negotiation of Trusteeship A agreements.6. In order to carry out the policy recommended in sub-paragraph (ii) of theprevious paragraph it is necessary to examine the &quot; practical steps &quot; which are called for under the United Nations Charter. Article 79 of the Charter reads asfollows :  &quot; The terms of Trusteeship for each territory to be placed under the trusteeship system, including any alteration or amendment, shall be agreedupon by the States directly concerned, including the Mandatory Power in thecase of territories held under mandate by a Member of the United Nations,and shall be approved as provided for in Articles 83 and 85.&quot;Articles 83 and 85 provide that the final approval of Trusteeship Agreementsrests with the Security Council in the case of &apos;&apos; strategic areas &apos;&apos; and with theGeneral Assembly in the case of all other territories.7.   The essential first steps we must take are therefore : (a) To prepare a draft Trusteeship Agreement for each territory to be placed under the system;(b) To determine who are the &quot; States directly concerned &quot; (vide Article 79)in respect of each territory;(c) To submit the draft to the &apos;&apos; States directly concerned &apos;&apos; and endeavour tosecure their concurrence in its terms.I should add that I attach particular importance to the Mandatory Powertaking the initiative in preparing the first draft of the Trusteeship Agreements.It is not clearly laid down in the Charter that this should be so, and the UnitedStates Delegation, while generally sympathetic to our point of view on Trusteeshipquestions, have let it be understood that they reserve themselves the right to submit proposals for Trusteeship terms for any territory in respect of which they holdthemselves to be a &quot; State directly concerned.&quot; This is an additional reason fora very early initiative on our part.Draft Trusteeship Agreement for African Mandates.8. In anticipation of this requirement my Department, in consultation withthe other Departments concerned and with the Governors of the territories, hasprepared a model Trusteeship Agreement for Tanganyika, Cameroons andTogoland, the text of which is at Annex III. I regret to burden my colleagues with a long draft of this nature, but as this is the instrument which will governour policy in these territories, both internationally and internally, in the comingyears, I think it is essential that they should see the draft at this stage.9. The draft Agreement has been based on the existing mandates, consider-ably modified to take into account the new features of the Trusteeship systemembodied in the United Nations Charter (Chapters XII and XIII) as well asimprovements dictated by past experience which can be effected consistently with the Charter. I should like to draw attention in particular to two newfeatures which represent an advance on the mandatory system.The first is the defence and military provisions, embodied in Articles 4 (b)and 5 (c) of the draft Agreement. These derive from Article 84 of the charter and make an end of the anomalous position under the mandate which, strictlyinterpreted, hampered the defence of mandated territories and the use of their resources in time of war against aggressor States. The Chiefs of Staff have seen the draft and agree that these provisions are satisfactory.The second improvement is in the economic field. The absolute requirement,in the Mandates, of non-discriminatory treatment for all members of the Leagueof Nations has not always operated to^the advantage of the mandated territoriesthemselves. At San Francisco our Delegation secured, after a stiff fight, the insertion of Article 76 (d) in the Charter laying it down that the non-discriminatory provisions must be without prejudice to the political, economic,social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of trust territories. effect is given to this step forward in Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the draft Agreement.10. Advantage was taken of the presence in London of the French and belgian delegations to the Preparatory Commission to discuss, at the official level,
draft Trusteeship agreements and procedure generally in relation to the Africanmandated territories. These discussions proceeded in a most cordial atmosphereand agreement was reached over the whole field. It is understood that the Frenchand Belgian officials have submitted to their Governments draft Trusteeship agree-ments parallel in all essentials to the draft annexed to this paper. There is reason to believe that the Belgian Government will approve. The FrenchEmbassy, however, have informed us that the French Cabinet have deferred con-si deration of placing French Cameroons and Togoland under Trusteeship pending further consultation with the consultative bodies on the spot. On this basis, theFrench Delegation would be unable to make any declaration of policy to theGeneral Assembly and may even ask us to make a similar postponement. Suchdelay would be most embarrassing to us, and I understand&apos;that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs intends to take the first opportunity of bringing pressure to bear on M. Bidault.11. Certain minor modifications of drafting may still be needed, but in allessentials the Agreement is&quot; now, I think, as satisfactory as it can be made. i therefore submit the draft Agreement in Annex III for approval as a basis ofinternational negotiation for Tanganyika, Cameroons and Togoland.&quot;States directly concerned.&quot;12. A further practical step called for on our part is that of communicatingthe draft Trusteeship Agreement to the &apos;&apos; States directly concerned &apos;&apos; for their concurrence. This places on us the responsibility of taking the initiative in determining who are the &quot; States directly concerned&quot; in each case. Politicalcomplications arise here which must be examined briefly. For the moment it isonly necessary to examine the problem in relation to the African mandated territories, though it must be borne in mind that the action taken will to someextent set a precedent for determining who are the &quot; States directly concerned &quot;in the case of Palestine or other territories that may subsequently be placed under trusteeship.13. The phrase &quot; States directly concerned &quot; was inserted into the Charterby the United States Delegation at San Francisco, and the British Delegationmade it clear that at that stage they were not committed to any specific interpreta-tion of the phrase. An agreed interpretation will, in fact, be difficult to findsince the selection of the &quot; States directly concerned &quot; can be approached from various angles juridical claims, strategic or political interests, geographical,contiguity or a combination of these methods according to the interests of states with claims to advance. It would probably be generally acceptable to include,inter alia, States whose territory is adjacent to the trust territory, on grounds of general regional interest. The real difficulty will arise over the position ofthose members of the &quot; Big Five &quot; who are not Colonial Powers, i.e., the UnitedStates, Russia and, to a lesser extent, China.14. It already seems clear that the U.S.S.R. will regard the five permanent members of the Security Council as automatically &quot; directly concerned &quot; in allTrusteeship Agreements for Mandated Territories, though they apparently donot exclude the addition of &quot; neighbouring States &quot; as well.15. The United States attitude is different. They wish to be accepted as&quot; directly concerned &quot; in the mandated territories, but it seems evident that theywill try to avoid any formula which would also result in the inclusion of Russia.The motive behind this is almost certainly a desire to keep Russia at arm&apos;s length in the ex-Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific, whose Trusteeship the UnitedStates no doubt hope to obtain for themselves presumably as strategic areas.According to present indications the Americans are therefore likely to advance the juridical argument that the States directly concerned in the mandated terri-tories are the surviving members of the Principal Allied and Associated Powersof World War I who originally allotted the mandates, i.e., the United States,France, and the British Empire (which last term they appear to interpret as meaning the United Kingdom only). Moreover, although the United States werenever a member of the League of Nations, they can also advance juridical claimsbased on Conventions^ concluded in the 1920&apos;s with ourselves and with the othermandatory Powers, in respect of all mandates exercised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom.16. There is no indication as yet of the Chinese attitude. As regardsFrance, the remaining member of the Big Five to be considered, the French
Delegation at the Preparatory Commission let it be known that they could not support any interpretation which included the United States - but excludedRussia.   They clo not, however, appear to object to the inclusion of both.17. The problem is clearly one which must be dealt with in terms of majorforeign policy rather than the strict merits of the case. Subject to any general conclusions which may have arisen from the Moscow Conference, it appears tome that we shall, in the end, have to accept the position that, whatever other claims are admitted, all the Big Five are automatically &quot; directly concerned &quot;on the grounds that they have world-wide responsibilities as permanent membersof the Security Council, that they are also ex offvcio members of the trusteeship council, and in the last resort that Russia cannot be kept out. It must beremembered that Trusteeship Agreements have to go before the Assembly for final approval, and thus that any State which is aggrieved at being left out of thepreliminary consultation of States directly concerned will be able to raiseobstacles at the Assembly stage.18. Some interim solution is necessary, and I think it would be a great mistake to put ourselves in the position of consulting all the other States whoseclaims we are willing to accept, including the United States but not Russia. Todo so would be open to obvious misrepresentation as a &quot; line-up &apos;&apos; of the western european Powers (who hold the Mandates), with the Americans against theSoviet Union. Some way out of the immediate difficulty must be found which enables us to escape the charge of delay while postponing for the moment theclaims of all the Big Five as such. A method of achieving this has been discussed on the official level with the French and Belgians, whose ideas have been foundto be fully in accordance with ours.19.   The interim method proposed is briefly as follows :--*(a) As a first step, to be taken immediately, we should communicate the draftTrusteeship Agreements only to those States who would unquestionablybe &apos;&apos; directly concerned &apos;&apos; on any interpretation of the phrase. Sucha &quot; short list &quot; can be constructed for our three African mandated territories, each of which consists of part of a former Germany colony,the other part of which was placed after World War I under mandateto another Power : France in the case of Cameroons and Togoland,Belgium in the case of German East Africa. In both cases, moreover,France and Belgium are the only fully qualified &quot; neighbouringterritories.&quot; Thus we should communicate the draft Agreements forCameroons and Togoland to the French Government and forTanganyika to the Belgian Government only. We have reason tobelieve that France would readily reciprocate in respect of FrenchCameroons and Togoland and Belgium in respect of Ruanda-Urundi.The position of South Africa requires, however, separate considera-tion see paragraph 20 below.(b) At the same time, copies of the drafts- should be sent, through diplomatic channels, for information purposes only at this stage, to the othermembers of the &quot; Big Five,&quot; all of. whom are ex officio members of the trusteeship Council: that is, the United States, Soviet and ChineseGovernments, with the addition of the French Government in thecase of Tanganyika. It should be made clear that this action wasnot intended to prejudge the issue of which were the &quot; States directly concerned.&quot;(c) We should inform the United Nations General iVssembly, at the earliestappropriate moment in the first part of the first session, that, subjectto agreement on satisfactory terms, we intend to place our Africanmandated territories under Trusteeship and that we have already taken the above-mentioned steps with a view to the early conclusionof Trusteeship Agreements. A copy of each draft Agreement shouldalso be sent to the Secretary-General for information.20. An initial interpretation on these lines (without prejudice to the subse-\ quent recognition of claims of other States) has many advantages; but would not include South Africa. The Union Government have, however, made it clear thatthey consider South Africa to be a State directly concerned in all our Africanmandates, and their claim to be consulted as to the disposal of the Italian colonies in Africa has already been admitted by the Council of Foreign Ministers. on general Commonwealth grounds there is naturally much to be said for admitting
South Africa&apos;s claims from the start, and incidentally she should prove a usefulally in the subsequent negotiation of the agreements. The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs attaches much importance to our meeting the wishes of SouthAfrica, and it was the general feeling of the Colonial Affairs Committee thatwe should do so.21. In the light of developments it may be necessary for me to consult mycolleagues again as to the full range of &quot; States directly concerned.&quot; A provi-sional list of such States (apart from members of the &quot; Big Five &quot; as such) hasbeen drawn up, for purposes of comparison, and is attached as Annex IV; butI do not ask for a decision on this list now.Timing.22. The General Assembly meets on the 10th January. The draft resolutionprepared by the Preparatory Commission (see paragraph 4 above) is likely to bethe first trusteeship business discussed. Moreover, I understand that the foreign secretary intends to make a general statement of United Kingdom policy towardsthe United Nations as a whole on Friday or Saturady, the 11th or 12th January.It would clearly be most desirable to take the initiative by stating the broad linesof our trusteeship policy in the course of this speech.23.   There are two possible difficulties about so early an announcement: i(a) In normal circumstances it would be preferable to announce our policyin Parliament before announcing it to an International Assembly.Parliament does not meet until the 22nd January. But we should lose the initiative by waiting. The constitutional proprieties will, I think,be fully met in the circumstances if the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement to the General Assembly makes it clear that the practical steps whichwe have to take to give effect to our policy will include parliamentary approval. A statement should also be made at the earliest practicablemoment to Parliament, which in fact is already aware of the general trend of our policy (except as regards Trans-Jordan).(b) It will leave little time to forewarn the local authorities and local opinion in East Africa, where the announcement will be regarded as of first-class importance and may be unpopular in certain quarters. Iconsider, however, that we should, nevertheless, proceed with theproposed time-table, on the understanding that the announcement (inthe General Assembly and subsequently in Parliament) should be soworded as to give public opinion here and in East Africa a satis-factory assurance that we have no intention of relinquishing theadministration of Tanganyika.Conclusions.24. The conclusions of this memorandum are summarised in the coveringnote by the Acting Chairman of the Colonial Affairs Committee.(Initialled) G. H. H.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,8th January, 1946.
ANNEX I.Telegram from Canadian Government to Dominions Office,dated 2nd January, 1946.YOUR telegram D. No. 2290 of the 22nd December. InternationalTrusteeship.In our view the proposed statement during the first part of the first sessionof the General Assembly with regard to placing mandated territories under the trusteeship system is a wise one. We are impressed with the argument that itmay be desirable for the United Kingdom Government to take the initiative inthis matter rather than to appear to act under pressure, and we feel that anannouncement along these lines at this time would make a good impression in theUnited States and elsewhere.Letter from Prime Minister of New Zealand to Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, dated 2nd January, 1946.Sir,I have the honour to refer to your telegram, D. 2290 of the 22nd December,1945, addressed to the Minister of External Affairs, New Zealand, asking for theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand towards placing UnitedKingdom mandated territories under trusteeship.The comments I desire to offer on behalf of the New Zealand Government areas follows : &apos;It will be recalled that following the Australia-New Zealand Conference heldin Wellington, November 1944, the New Zealand Government expressed the viewthat in this matter of trusteeship the initiative should be taken by the BritishCommonAvealth. Your decision to announce that Tanganyika, Togoland and the cameroons should be placed under trusteeship is therefore most warmly welcomed.So far. as New Zealand is concerned, the Government have agreed that WesternSamoa should be placed under trusteeship, and on the eve of my departure from new Zealand, I made a public statement to that effect. I will, accordingly, makea similar statement during the course of the forthcoming Assembly.The New Zealand Government are fully in accord with the course proposedin your telegram regarding Palestine. We would for our part be inclined to go further in the direction of giving consideration to some form of joint trusteeshipfor Palestine in order to ensure that other United Nations should share theresponsibility for this area instead of leaving the whole burden to be borne as in&apos;the past and at present by the United Kingdom Government.In the case of Transjordan, the New Zealand Government consider that theformer course set out in your telegram is the preferable one to follow, namely,that the mandate should be terminated and an application for membership of u.N.O. by Transjordan should be supported by the members of the BritishC common wealth.It is felt that early action should also be taken to decide what should be donein respect of Nauru, which is under mandate to the three Governments, UnitedKingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. In this case it is considered important that a simultaneous declaration should be made by the three Governments whenthe United Kingdom issue their own statement concerning Tanganyika, Togolandand the Cameroons, that Nauru will also be placed under trusteeship.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed) P. ERASER,Minister of External Affairs.
Letter from the High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated Slst December, 1945.My clear Secretary of State,Trusteeship.With reference to your Circular telegram D. No. 2290, my Prime minister has instructed me to submit the following considerations to the attention of theUnited Kingdom Government.The Union Government are deeply concerned about the strategic position of africa facing the Indian Ocean, it is assumed that so far as the Atlantic isconcerned the United States of America could be relied upon to play its part inany real threat to the security of the British areas from that direction. But along the Eastern side of Africa there is a continuous British Commonwealth line fromthe Sudan to the Cape-and twice before has that line been seriously threatenedin both world wars. With changes now emerging in the Middle East from theMediterranean to the Caspian and the Persian Gulf there is no guarantee thatclanger may not once more arise on the Indian Ocean side of Africa.The United Kingdom, the British Colonies, and the Union of South Africaare all vitally interested in the safety of this immense line of communicationacross the length of the Continent, and all of them have made great sacrifices inthe past to assure its safety. Tanganyika is the vital link in this long chain of security. The Union Government would submit for the very serious considerationof the United Kingdom Government, the reservation of this territory as a strategic area with power to take special measures for its defence. Should infuture India become an independent sovereign country dissociated from theCommonwealth, the necessity for such a step may become even more accentuated.The Indian Ocean would bear the same relation to British African strategythat the Pacific Ocean bears to American strategy. It would, therefore, be properthat the United Kingdom, together, if necessary, with the Union of South Africa,should have the same strategic position in Tanganyika that the United States ofAmerica would possess in vital Pacific Islands. The Security Council shouldconcede the special strategic position of the British Commonwealth in Tanganyikafor the future security of the Commonwealth and Empire. Great emphasis shouldbe laid on this now historic line of communications.The Union Government trust, therefore, that before any public announce-ment is made regarding the United Kingdom intention to place Tanganyika under trusteeship, the security aspects to which attention is drawn above will be givenvery careful examination and an opportunity furnished for further mutualconsultation before any final decision is taken.Yours sincerely,(Signed) R. JONES.(In the absence of the High Commissioner).ANNEX ii.The Future of Trans-Jordan.As indicated in CP. (45) 342, the Mandate for Palestine and Trans-Jordanis the same, with the exception that the clauses about the Jewish National Homedo not apply in Trans-Jordan. It is an &quot; A &quot; Mandate : that is, the avowedobjective when it was conferred was independence after a relatively short periodof &quot; advice and assistance &quot; by a Western Power. Trans-Jordan already enjoysa large measure of internal autonomy and also participates in the Arab League.Now that Iraq, Syria and Lebanon have achieved independence, Trans-Jordanis the only Middle East country still under Mandate, with the exception ofPalestine, which is, of course, in a category by itself. Both the Amir and peopleof Trans-Jordan wish to end the mandatory regime and their desire to achieveequality with the neighbouring Arab States is an intrinsically reasonable one,particularly since they gave us loyal and active support even during the worst
period of the war. In 1944, in response to approaches by the Trans-jordan government, the following declaration was made to them : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government fully appreciate that it is the desire of thepeople of Trans-Jordan that they should take their place on an equal footing with the peoples of neighbouring Arab countries, and to this end they would welcome the conclusion of a Treaty with Trans-Jordan which would conformmore closely to the circumstances of the times than does the Agreement of1928. For technical reasons the negotiation of such a Treaty must await theconclusion of the war. But, although meanwhile formal relations between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Trans-Jordan must continue as at present, it will be the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government to interpret them with due regard to this intention.&quot;2. This declaration is widely known and has been generally interpretedlocally as meaning that independence would be achieved once the war was over..3. In view of the resolution about Mandated territories, which is to besubmitted to the General Assembly, we cannot expect the position of Trans-Jordan to be passed over in silence. We must, therefore, either come out infavour of independence, or alternatively say that we wish to replace the Mandateby a Trusteeship Agreement. The former course is a logical outcome of ourpresent policy, and I believe that it would greatly strengthen our position both inthe United Nations Assembly and in the Middle East. The latter course wouldnot only cause grave disappointment in Trans-Jordan itself and in the other arab countries, but would also, I believe, lead us into serious international difficulties and prove to be-impracticable.4. An attempt to place Trans-Jordan under Trusteeship would expose us,in the first place, to attack by the Arab delegations on the grounds that independence was already &apos;&apos; provisionally recognised &apos;&apos; in the League Covenantand that we were defaulting on our &quot; promise &quot; made to Trans-Jordan in 1944.The Arabs could quote against us our own action in supporting the emancipationof Syria and the Lebanon from the mandatory regime even while the war was stillin progress, and in spite of &quot; technical difficulties.&quot; Secondly, we should be giving an opening for damaging criticism by the Soviet bloc. In the PreparatoryCommission the latter supported the motion that the Trusteeship Council should hold regular elections in all trust territories, and attempted to represent Britishopposition to this and similar proposals as being due to a desire to stifle the free expression of the wishes of dependant peoples and their aspirations for independence. A reluctance on our part to &quot; liberate &quot; Trans-Jordan wouldprovide the Soviet bloc with admirable ammunition to continue their campaign of misrepresentation against the Colonial Powers and would materially lowerour credit in the Middle East while correspondingly raising that of Russia.Thirdly, it could easily be read by the French as an attempt to preserve for ourselves in a British Mandated territory privileges which we have denied toFrance in the Levant States formerly under French mandate, thus confirmingFrench suspicions that our real policy in Syria and the Lebanon is to substituteBritish for French influence and undermining the detente recently achieved inthe Anglo-French Levant Agreement.5. The combination of these hostile factors would, I consider, place usin an untenable position in the General Assembly. It must be remembered, more-over, that the actual terms of Trusteeship must be agreed by the States directly concerned, and all the States mentioned above, particularly the Ai-ab States,would have strong claims to be recognised as directly concerned in Trans-Jordan.Thus an attempt to implement a policy of Trusteeship would, in any case, runinto deadlock at an early stage.6. I therefore consider that there is in practice no alternative to a policyof independence for Trans-Jordan. If this is the position, then we have clearlymuch to gain from making the gesture voluntarily and announcing our policy as early as possible in the Assembly. Apart from the satisfaction which it wouldgive in Trans-Jordan itself, this action should have the following importantadvantages: (a) It should enhance British prestige and give us a moral ascendancy inthe subsequent proceedings of the Assembly, not only in Trusteeshipbut in other matters, while making it extremely difficult for our criticsto continue the tactics of misrepresentation which they have followedhitherto.
(&amp;) It should secure for us the votes&apos; of the five Arab League States which on Trusteeship matters are at present regularly cast with the soviet bloc against us. This would result in a net gain of at least ten votes,apart from other members of the United Nations who might be similarly influenced in our favour. -We shall need all the support wecan obtain at the Assembly (where a two-thirds majority is necessary on important questions) to secure our desiderata on Trusteeshipmatters.(c) It should considerably strengthen our position in the Middle East ata time when a goodwill of the Arab States will be particularly important to us, in relation to such issues as the settlement of palestine and the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.7. Against this, it must be borne in mind that Zionist opinion has alwaysresented the exclusion of Trans-Jordan from the ai&apos;ea available for the establish-ment of the Jewish National Home, and the recognition of the independence of trans-Jordan would make it virtually impossible for Zionist ambitions in that direction to be realised.8. The implications of making Trans-Jordan an independent State havebeen examined in consultation between the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office,and it is necessary to mention briefly the following additional points: -(a) It will be necessary to negotiate a new Treaty with Trans-Jordan onthe lines of the Treaty which replaced the Mandate for Iraq in 1932.The Amir Abdullah has already been invited to London; he isexpected to&apos;arrive within the next two months and the discussions fora new Treaty will be opened then. We should naturally wish to besatisfied that adequate provisions for defence and similar facilities were included in the Treaty; and it is proposed to ask the Chiefs ofStaff to consider forthwith what military provisions (compatible withindependent status) should be included.(b) The new Treaty is a matter for bilateral negotiation between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and Trans-Jordan, on which I do not anticipate any serious difficulties. It would be unnecessary and also, in my view,most unwise to say anything in public to the United Nations whichimplied that Trans-Jordan&apos;s independence is conditional on HisMajesty&apos;s Government obtaining satisfactory Treaty facilities. Thisis particularly important since we have taken the line that no suchcondition can legitimately be enforced in the case of Syria and the lebanon, who have become independent without signing a Treaty with france.(c) Trans-Jordan will probably continue to need financial assistance, though&apos;only towards the cost of defence, which is a British interest. This,however, need not be an obstacle to recognition of its independencesince,.for example, we restored the independence of Ethiopia in 1942&apos;while paying her a subsidy. There is no occasion for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to hold up the implementation of independence on finanTcial grounds unless other members of the United Nations choose to raisethe point, which is in fact very unlikely.(d) It is not considered necessary to seek the formal approval of the united nations for the recognition of Trans-Jordan&apos;s independence. the admission of Trans-Jordan to the United Nations Organisation is aseparate issue which can be dealt with later in accordance with the&apos;procedure laid down in the Charter (Article 4).(e) The precise form of announcement to be made at this stage has been carefully considered and the following text is proposed:-&quot; With reference to Trans-Jordan, it is the intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to take steps in the near future for estab-lishing this territory as a sovereign independent State and forrecognising its status as such. His Highness the Amir Abdullah has accepted an invitation to come to London for discussions to this end.In these circumstances the question of placing Trans-Jordan under trusteeship does not arise.&quot;

United Kingdom Middle East Mandates.(4) Palestine.(a) The States of the Arab League (Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the lebanon; and Trans-Jordan if she has by that time been admitted to the United Nations see following paragraph), on &quot;regional&quot;grounds.[Note. If it were felt1 that there were political difficulties in con-suiting such a long list of Arab States, consideration could be given toinviting the Council of the Arab League to nominate one or two representatives to speak on behalf of the League as such.](b) The United States, in view of her joint responsibility with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the new Palestine Commission.(c) France, in view of her interests in the Levant as recognised in the recentAnglo-French Agreement.(d) Russia, in view of her ecclesiastical and cultural interests in palestine and the Near East (parallel in some respects to those of France).Note. The question of trusteeship for Palestine is an issue on its own which requires separate study, and the above observations are provisional only.(5) Trans-Jordan.Technically, there is only one mandate for both Palestine and Trans-Jordan,although the clauses relating to the Jewish National Home do not apply in the
latter&apos; part of the mandated area : thus, in principle, the &apos;&apos; States directly con-cerned&apos;&apos; should be the same as for Palestine. The question of trusteeship maynot arise, however, in the case of-Trans-Jordan, for the reasons stated in the mainpaper.C. Territories under Dominion Mandate.The determination of the &quot; States directly concerned &quot; is of course primarilya matter for the Dominion Governments in question. Nevertheless, it may bedesirable to examine provisionally how the precedent set in the case of the UnitedKingdom mandates would apply in these cases, particularly from the point ofview of possible requirements of the United Kingdom Government to be &quot; directly concerned.&quot;(6) South-West Africa under South African Mandate.The Union Government notified the San Francisco Conference of their inten-tion at the Peace Conference to seek approval to incorporate South-West africa in the Union of South Africa. If the question of placing it under trusteeshipshould arise, however, the United Kingdom, France and Belgium could claim tobe &quot;directly concerned&quot; on &quot;regional&quot; grounds. In addition, the UnitedKingdom would have a claim as ruler of a contiguous territory (bechuanaland protectorate). The United States has no formal treaty rights corresponding tothose in Tanganyika, but was given a formal assurance that, so long as the termsof the mandate remained unaltered, United States nationals and goods wouldbe treated equally with nationals and goods of any State, member of the Leagueof Nations, except those within the British Empire. The United States mightbase a claim accordingly to be a &quot; State directly concerned.&quot;New Guinea and Western Samoa.These two territories can conveniently be considered together. The UnitedKingdom would presumably claim to be a &quot; State directly concerned &quot; in both cases in view of her interests in Fiji and the Western Pacific High Commission.The position of the United States is similar to that it holds vis-a-vis South-WestAfrica.(7) New Guinea.The United States will no doubt claim on strategic grounds to be a &quot; Statedirectly concerned &apos;&apos; in New Guinea. The Philippine Commonwealth may makea similar claim on strategic and on &quot; proximity &quot; grounds. The Netherlandscould claim on account of contiguity and France may do so on account of theproximity of the New Hebrides Condominium.(8) Western Samoa.The United States could claim to be a &quot; State directly concerned &quot; on strategic grounds, on account of the contiguity of American Samoa, and as a party to the Samoa Convention of 1899. (The United Kingdom could also claim under the 1899 Convention.) France might base a claim on the proximity ofFrench Oceania (Tahiti).The willingness of the Australian and New Zealand Governments to admitUnited States claims in the case of New Guinea and Western Samoa respectively,may be linked with the attitude of the United States Government to claims onthe part of Australia and possibly also New Zealand, to be &quot; States directly concerned &quot; in Islands formerly under Japanese mandate which are likely to beplaced under United States trusteeship.(9) Nauru.A &quot; C &quot; Mandate for Nauru was conferred on the &quot; British Empire.&quot; by virtue of the Nauru Island Agreement of 1923 and the Supplementary Agreementof 1926 between the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, the Islandhas been and still is administered by Australia, subject to consultation with theUnited Kingdom and New Zealand about the appointment of the Administrator.It is primarily for the Australian Government to decide whether Nauru shouldbe placed under Trusteeship, and if they decide that it should they would nodoubt consult the Governments of both New Zealand and the United Kingdom,who would clearly be among the &quot; States directly concerned.&quot; The United states might make a claim on similar grounds to those discussed in connection with (7)and (8) above.
