THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.SECRET. Copy No.  3CP. (46) 10.8th January, 1946.CABINET.SOVIET-PERSIAN TREATY RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT the Cabinet meeting on the 1st January I undertook to circulate tomy colleagues further information about the Russo-Persian Treaty of the26th February, 1921. I now attach the text of that Treaty, together with the texts of two notes referring to it, which were exchanged between the Russiandiplomatic representative at Tehran and the Persian Minister for Foreign affairs on the 12th December, 1921.2. The Article which gives the Russians the right in certain circumstances to send troops into Persia is Article 6. It will be seen that the cases in whichthis right might be exercised are further defined in the first paragraph ofMr. Rotstein&apos;s note of the 12th December, 1921.3. There is a further Treaty between the Soviet Union and Persia, that ofthe 1st October, 1927. This Treaty, which is described as a Treaty of Guaranteeand Neutrality, declares that all the provisions of the 1921 Treaty remain inforce, and makes that Treaty applicable to the whole territory of the U.S.S.R.Article 2 of the Treaty lays down that neither party will introduce its militaryforces into the territory of the other, but a special protocol declares that thisprovision does not apply to cases covered by Article 6 of the Treaty of the26th February, 1921.E. B.Foreign Office, 8th January, 1946.Treaty of Friendship between Persia and Russia. Moscow,26th February, 1921.[Ratifications exchanged at Tehran, 26th February, 1922.](Translation.)The Persian Government, of the one part, and the Russian Socialist FederalSoviet Republic, of the other part, desiring to establish relations of friendship and fraternity between the two nations, have decided to engage in negotiationsfor this purpose, and have therefore appointed the following Plenipotentiaries : For Persia : Ali Gholi Khan Mochaverol-Memalek, andFor Russia : O. V. Chicherin and L. M. Karakhan,Who, after the verification of their respective powers, have agreed asfollows : article I. In order to confirm its declarations regarding Russian policy towards the Persian nation, which formed the subject of correspondence on the14th January, 1918, and the 26th June, 1919, the R.S.F.S.R. formally affirmsonce again that it definitely renounces the tyrannical policy carried out by thecolonising Governments of Russia which have been overthrown by the will of theworkers and peasants of Russia.13100   [31140] - b
Inspired by this principle, and desiring that the Persian people should behappy and independent and should be able to dispose freely of its patrimony, theRussian Republic declared the whole body of treaties and conventions concluded with Persia by the Tsarist Government, which crushed the rights of the Persianpeople, to be null and void.II. The R.S.F.S.R. expresses its reprobation of the policy of the TsaristGovernments of Russia, which, on the pretext of ensuring the independence ofthe peoples -of Asia, concluded, without the consent of the latter, treaties with european Powers, the sole object of which was to subjugate those peoples.This criminal policy, which infringed upon the independence of the countries of Asia and which made the living nations of the East a prey to the cupidity andthe tyranny of European robbers, is abandoned unconditionally by Federal Russia.Federal Russia, therefore, in accordance with the principles laid down in articles I and IV of this Treaty, declares its refusal to participate in any actionwhich might destroy or weaken Persian sovereignty. It regards as null and voidthe whole body of treaties and conventions concluded by the former RussianGovernment with third parties in respect of Persia or to the detriment of thatcountry.III. The two Contracting Powers agree to accept and respect the Russo-Persian frontiers, as drawn up by the Frontier Commission in 1881.At the same time, in view of the repugnance which the Russian federal government feels to enjoying the fruit of the policy of usurpation of the TsaristGovernment, it renounces all claim to the Achouradeh Islands and to the otherislands on the Astrabad Littoral, and restores to Persia the village of Firouzehand the adjacent land ceded to Russia in virtue of the Convention of the28th May, 1893.The Persian Government agrees for its part that the Russian Sarakhs, or&quot; old &quot; Sarakhs, and the land adjacent to the Sarakhs River, shall be retained by Russia.The two High Contracting Parties shall have equal rights of usage overthe Atrak River and the other frontier rivers and waterways. In order finallyto solve the question of the waterways and all disputes concerning frontiers orterritories, a Commission, composed of Russian and Persian representatives, shallbe appointed.IV. In consideration of the fact that each nation has the right to determinefreely its political destiny, each of the two Contracting Parties formally expressesits desire to abstain from any intervention in the internal affairs of the other.V. The two High Contracting Parties undertake 1. To prohibit the formation or presence within their respective territories of any organisations or groups of persons, irrespective of the name by whichthey are known, whose object is to engage in acts of hostility against Persia orRussia, or against the allies of Russia.They will likewise prohibit the formation of troops or armies within theirrespective territories with the aforementioned object.2. Not to allow a third party or any organisation, whatever it be called,which is hostile to the other Contracting Party, to import or to convey in transitacross their countries material which can be used against the other Party.3. To prevent by all means in their power the presence within their terri-tories or within the territories of their allies of all armies or forces of a third party in cases in which the presence of such forces would be regarded as a menace to the frontiers, interests or safety of the other Contracting Party.VI. If a third party should attempt to carry out a policy of usurpationby means of armed intervention in Persia, or if such Power should desire touse Persian territory as a base of operations against Russia, or if a foreign power should threaten the frontiers of Federal Russia or those of its allies, andif the Persian Government should not be able to put a stop to such menace after having been once called upon to do so by Russia, Russia shall have the rightto advance her troops into the Persian interior for the purpose of carrying outthe military operations necessary for its defence. Russia undertakes, however,to withdraw her troops from Persian territory as soon as the danger has been removed.VII. The considerations set forth in Article VI have equal weight in thematter of the security of the Caspian Sea. The two High Contracting Partiestherefore have agreed that Federal Russia shall have the right to require the
Persian Government to send away foreign subjects, in the event of their taking advantage of their engagement in the Persian navy to undertake hostile actionagainst Russia.VIII. Federal Russia finally renounces the economic policy pursued in theEast by the Tsarist Government, which consisted in lending money to the PersianGovernment, not with a view to the economic development of the country, but rather for purposes of political subjugation.Federal Russia accordingly renounces its rights in respect of the loansgranted to Persia by the Tsarist Governments. It regards the debts due to itas void, and will not require their repayment. Russia likewise renounces itsclaims to the resources of Persia which were specified as security for the loansin question.        -IX. In view of the declaration by which it has repudiated the colonial &quot;andcapitalist policy which occasioned so many misfortunes and was the cause of so much bloodshed, Federal Russia abandons the continuation of the economicundertakings of the Tsarist Government, the object of which was the economicsubjugation of Persia. Federal Russia therefore cedes to the Persian Govern-ment the full ownership of all funds and of all real and other property whichthe Russian Discount Bank possesses on Persian territory, and likewise transfersto it all the assets and liabilities of that bank. The Persian Government never-theless agrees that in the towns where it has been decided that the RussianSocialist Republic may establish consulates, and where buildings exist belongingto the Discount Bank, one of these buildings, to be chosen by the Russian Govern-ment, shall be placed at the disposal of the Russian Consulate, free of charge.X. The Russian Federal Government, having abandoned the colonial policy, which consisted in the construction of roads and telegraph lines more inorder to obtain military influence in other countries than for the purpose of developing their civilisations, and being desirous of providing the Persian people with those means of communication indispensable for the independence anddevelopment of any nation, and also in order to compensate the Persian people as far as possible for the losses incurred by the sojourn in its territory of theTsarist armies, cedes free of charge to the Persian Government the followingRussian installations:  (a) The high-roads from Enzeii to Tehran, and from Kazvin to Hamadan,and all land and installations in the connection with these roads.(b) The  railroad  Djoulfa-Tauris-Sofian-Urmia,   with  all  installations,rolling-stock and accessories.(c) The landing-stages, warehouses, steamships, canals, and all means oftransport of the lake of Urmia.id) All telegraph and telephone lines established in Persia by the TsaristGovernments, with all movable and  immovable installations anddependencies.(e) The port of Enzeii and the warehouses, with the electrical installation,and other buildings.XL In view of the fact that the Treaty of Turkomantchai, concluded on the10th February, 1828 (old style), between Persia and Russia, which forbids Persia,under the terms of Article 8, to have vessels in the waters of the Caspian Sea, isabrogated in accordance with the principles set forth in Article I of the presentTreaty, the two High Contracting Parties shall enjoy equal rights of freenavigation on that sea, under their own flags, as from the date of the signing ofthe present Treaty.XII. The Russian Federal Government, having officially renounced alleconomic interests obtained by military preponderance, further declares that,apart from the concessions which form the subject of Articles IX and X, the otherconcessions obtained by force by the Tsarist Government and its subjects shalkalsobe regarded as null and void.In conformity with which the Russian Federal Government restores, as fromthe date of the signing of the present Treaty, to the Persian Government, as representing the Persian people, all the concessions in question, whether already being worked or not, together with all land taken over in virtue of those con-cessions.Of the lands and properties situated in Persia and belonging to the formerTsarist Government, only the premises of the Russian Legation at Tehran and atZerguendeh with all movable and immovable appurtenances, as well as all real[31140] b 2
and other property of the Consulates and Vice-Consulates, shall be retained by russia. Russia abandons, however, her right to administer the village ofZerguendeh, which was arrogated to itself by the former Tsarist Government.XIII. The Persian Government, for its part, promises not to cede to a thirdPower, or to its subjects, the concessions and property restored to Persia by virtueof the present Treaty, and to maintain those rights for the Persian nation.XIV. The Persian Government, recognising the importance of the Caspianfisheries for the food supply of Russia, promises to conclude with the Food Serviceof the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic immediately upon the expiry ofthe legal period of these existing engagements, a contract relating to the fisheries,containing appropriate clauses. Furthermore, the Persian Government promisesto examine, in agreement with the Government of the Russian Socialist FederalSoviet Republic, the means of at once conveying the produce of the fisheries tothe Food Service of Soviet Russia pending the conclusion of the above contract.XV. In accordance with the principle of liberty of conscience proclaimedby Soviet Russia, and with a desire to put an end, in Moslem countries, to religiouspropaganda, the real object of which was to exercise political influence over the masses and thus to satisfy the rapacity of the Tsarist Government, the Governmentof Soviet Russia declares that the religious settlements established in Persia bythe former Tsarist Governments are abolished. Soviet Russia will take steps toprevent such missions from being sent to Persia in the future.Soviet Russia cedes unconditionally to the nation represented by the PersianGovernment the lands, property and buildings belonging to the Orthodox Missionsituated at Urmia, together with the other similar establishments. The PersianGovernment shall use these properties for the construction of schools and other institutions intended for educational purposes.XVI. By virtue of the communication from Soviet Russia dated the 25thJune, 1919, with reference to the abolition of consular jurisdictions, it is decidedthat Russian subjects in Persia and Persian subjects in Russia shall, as from thedate of the present Treaty, be placed upon the same footing as the inhabitants of the towns in which they reside; they shall be subject to the laws of their country of residence, and shall submit their complaints to the local Courts.XVII.

CHICHERIN.L. KARAKHAN.MOCHA VEROL-MEMALEK.Exchange of Notes between Persia and Russia relative to Articles III,V, VI, XIII and XX of the Treaty of Friendship between thetwo Countries, Signed at Moscow, 26th February, 1921. Tehran,12th December, 1921.(No. 1.) The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Russian DiplomaticRepresentative at Tehran.(Translation.)(No. 2654.)Sir, Tehran, 12th December, 1921.The Persian Government and the Mejlishave observed that Articles V and vi of the Treaty concluded between our two countries are worded vaguely; theMejlis, moreover, desires that the retrocession of Russian concessions to thePersian Government should be made without reserve or condition, and that article XX should be so worded as to allow the Persian Government full powers for the transit of imports and exports. Conversations have taken place with youon these questions, and you have given explanations with regard to Articles Vand VI and promises concerning Articles XIII and XX, to the effect that if theTreaty were passed by the Mejlis you would give all the assistance in your powerto ensure that the two Articles in question should be revised on the lines desired by the Mejlis and the Persian Government. The Persian Government and theMejlis are most desirous that friendly relations should be re-established between our two Governments, and that the Treaty, which is based upon the most amicablesentiments, should be concluded as soon as possible.I have, therefore, the honour to request you to give in writing your explana-tions with regard to the interpretation of Articles V and VI, and to repeat thepromises of support which you have already given as regards the revision ofArticles XIII and XX, in order that the Persian Government may be enabled to secure the passing of the Treaty by the Mejlis.I also wish to ask you to take the necessary steps to repair the error whichhas been made in Article III, in which the word &quot; Commission &quot; was writteninstead of &quot; Treaty,&quot; as the only Treaty which was concluded in 1881 was a frontier delimitation Treaty, and this is the Treaty referred to in Article III.I have, &amp;c.MOCHAROS-SALTANEH.
(No. 2.) The Russian Diplomatic Representative at Tehran to the PersianMinister for Foreign Affairs.(No. 1600.)Your Excellency, Tehran, 12th December, 1921.IN reply to your letter dated the 20th day of Ghows, I have the honour to inform you that Articles V and VI are intended to apply onlyto cases in which preparations have been made for a considerable armed attack upon Russia or the Soviet Republics allied to her, by the partisansof the regime which has been overthrown or by its supporters among those foreign powers which are in a position to assist the enemies of the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos;Republics and at the same time to possess themselves, by force or by underhandmethods, of part of the Persian territory, thereby establishing a base of operations for any attacks-made either directly or through the counter-revolutionary forces which they might meditate against Russia or the Soviet Republics allied to her.The Articles referred to are therefore in no sense intended to apply to verbal orwritten attacks directed against the Soviet Government by the various Persiangroups, or even by any Russian emigres in Persia, in so far as such attacks aregenerally tolerated as between neighbouring - Powers animated by sentiments of mutual friendship.With regard to Articles XIII and XX, and the small error to which youdraw attention in Article III with reference to the Convention of 1881, I am ina position to state categorically, as I have always stated, that my Government,whose attitude towards the Persian nation is entirely friendly, has never sought to place any restriction upon the progress and prosperity of Persia. I myselffully share this attitude, and would be prepared, should friendly relations bemaintained between the two countries, to promote negotiations with a view to atotal or partial revision of these Articles on the lines desired by the PersianGovernment, as far as the interests of Russia permit.In view of the preceding statements, I trust that, as you promised me inyour letter, your Government and the Mejlis will ratify the Treaty in question as soon as possible.I have, &amp;c.ROTSTEIN,Diplomatic Representative of the RussianSocialist Federal Soviet Republic.
