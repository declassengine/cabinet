THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.29SECRET.CP. (46) 8.7 th January, 1946.CABINET.REPORT OF T.U.C. DELEGATION ON VISIT TO GERMANY.Note by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.AS arranged at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 3rd January (CM. (46)2nd Conclusions, Minute 2) I circulate for information the attached report of theT.U.C. Delegation which recently visited the British Zone of Germany.REPORT BY THE T.U.C. DELEGATION TO THE BRITISH-CONTROLLED ZONE OF GERMANY.Appointment of Delegation.1. The appointment of the Delegation followed upon the receipt of a letterfrom the Director of Civil Affairs, General A. V. Anderson, of the War Office,on 25th September. It said that the Secretary of State for War extended &quot; an invitation to the T.U.C. to nominate a small representative Delegation to visit the British Zone of Occupation in Germany with a view to discussing with theBritish Element of the Control Commission problems arising in germany in which the T.U.C. may be particularly interested and upon which their advice would be of value.&quot; The letter went on to say that a programme of visits throughout the Zone should be undertaken in order that the Delegationmay be in a position &quot;to give advice on the basis of first-hand knowledge of thesituation. The Delegation comprised Mr. H. Bullock, Mr. W. Lawther andMr. J. Tanner. They were accompanied by Mr. E. P. Harries, Secretary,Organisation Department, and Mr. A. E. Carthy, International Department.Political Considerations.2. Before the Delegation left England, they were well aware that the form which the German Trade Union Movement will take during the period of military occupation will be primarily affected by political decisions regarding the Govern-nlent of Germany. If Germany is to be permanently divided into four militaryzones, that would mean a different form of structure to that which is practicableif Germany becomes an entity. If the Ruhr and Rhineland are to be inter-nationalised, that will also have its effect.3. Further, the political decision whether or not Germany would be partlyde-industrialised obviously has a considerable bearing upon the future of TradeUnionism in that country.4. It was also clear that the economic status of Germany would be affectedfor a considerable period by reparations. German workers could&apos;not look forward with hope to improving their immediate standard of living through the develop-ment of German industry.  The crimes of the German people have to be paid for,J. B. H.Norfolk House, St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,7 th January, 1946.Introduction.[31125]b
and all surpluses over and above a minimum required for the nutrition of theGerman people will be used for the benefit of the peoples they have so greatlywronged.5. As British Trade Unionists, we naturally went to Germany with the background formed by our experience. We were aware of the great tendency in the German character to go &quot; all out&quot; for centralisation. We had also beeninformed that in the early days after the capitulation, efforts were made to formone Trade Union in Germany which would be sectionalised to meet the require-ments of the various trades and industries. This desire was founded upon the conviction of those who had retained the desire for Trade Unionism during the nazi Regime and who felt that the division of the German Trade Unions intonon-industrial groups based upon either religious or political parties was inimicalto their future. Among a group of sincere, Germans who were Trade Unionistsand among some of the refugees in England and other countries the ambitiongrew to form one Trade Union.6. The position in the British Zone, as we found it, was that, althoughbranches of local Unions were encouraged, all attempts at extending the unions to counties or districts had been temporarily vetoed. Also that proof was requiredin each case that proper elections for delegates had been held. The Unionsformed were not permitted to engage in negotiations with their employersregarding hours or wages. The reasons for this latter prohibition were thatthese matters were largely outside the control of the employers, and any increases in wages which might be conceded would increase the danger of inflation. Alsothat the reparation requirements might dictate longer hours of work than would normally be worked to meet German needs. A further embargo which has beenplaced by the British Military Government is upon the formation of Trade unions in those industries which are not at present working.The Food Situation.7. As a matter of fact, the prohibition of wage discussions did not appearto be so important as we at first imagined. German rations are divided into fivecategories (see Appendix &quot;A &quot;) and the cost of the heaviest ration is 7-44 marksper week (approx. 3s. 9d.) even if all the foodstuff is available. We were informedthat coffee is extremely scarce and tea non-existent, while meat is available twiceper month. During the summer and autumn townspeople cycled into the countryto buy any available surplus, but this source has now dried up. There are nocanteens, cafes or restaurants, so the workpeople must live on their rations alone.In these circumstances, wages lose much of their importance, especially as rentsare low, the average in Berlin being 65 marks (32s. Qd.) per month.U nemployment.8. Unemployment is low. Of the 595,000 inhabitants in the British sector of Berlin, 5,100 are registered as unemployed, but of these approximately 2,500 areelderly, black-coated workers who are being gradually transferred to the social welfare Fund. In the whole British Zone out of a population of approximately20 millions the number of unemployed is 400,000 of whom about 100,000 are unfit for normal employment. There are still 200,000 people to return to Hamburg,which is regarded as a good food area. All over the British Zone large numbersof men and women are clearing debris, hand-cleaning bricks, cutting down treesfor fuel, strengthening bridges, &amp;c. The extent of bomb damage in the Ruhrcan be gauged by the fact that the amount of debris in Essen is estimated at million tons. If men and materials were available in unlimited quantity it isestimated that it would take fifty years to rebuild Berlin9. In view of the facts stated above, your Delegation came to the preliminaryconclusion that a &apos;&apos; free &apos;&apos; Trade Union Movement as we understand it in thiscountry, with the full rights of Trade Unionism, was not practical politics atthe present time, and was unlikely to become so during the military occupationof Germany.Coal Production.10. The pre-war output of the British Section of the Ruhr coalfield was130 miilion tons per annum. 10 per cent, of the pits are out of production owingto war damage and 25 per cent, of the remainder are badly damaged. Thepresent potential is approximately 100 million tons per annum.
11. Output is gradually rising and is now 1,190,000 tons gross per week or 989,000 tons of clean coal. The output per man-shift has gradually risen until it is now 2-78 tons per face worker, 1-15 tons per worker employed underground,and -81 tons all employed. Absenteeism is 19 per cent., of which 4-5 per cent, isdue to holidays, 10 per cent, due to sickness and 2 per cent, to accidents, while1 - 5 per cent, is absence without leave.12. We held conferences with trade union representatives in the Ruhr,in Hamburg and in Berlin. At these conferences we were impressed by the factthat the circumstances and the views in these three centres were very oftendiametrically opposed. There is no connection between the three centres, dueto lack of transport. The local leaders have not met since the end of the war andhave only a vague idea of what is taking place elsewhere. So far as we havebeen able to ascertain, with the exception of Brunswick and Oldenburg there isno embryo trade union organisation in any other part of the British Zone ofoccupation.Hamburg.13. The trade union position in Germany was well expressed by herr Spliedt at the meeting with the Hamburg leaders on the 24th November :&quot; We have only one question which you, as trade unionists, will be interested in,and that is the following : you have been in the Ruhr, you are now in Hamburg,and you have probably seen that quite different views on trade union policyexist: that is a difference of opinion which at the present time permeates thenew German trade union movement: should we form independent trade unionsor should we form a single, united trade union as you have probably seen in the ruhr? When you get to Berlin you will have the same experience as you didin the Ruhr. We in Hamburg take the line that we want independent, separatetrade unions, which will, nevertheless, be linked together at the top level, just asin England through the Trades Union Congress.&quot;Ruhr.14. When we were in the Ruhr we were given a translation of the organisa-tion plan drawn up by Hans Bockler and his colleagues, from which the following is an extract : &apos;&quot; Structure of organisation.The structure of the collective trade union is one of a single, general trade union and is not, therefore, of a Federation of autonomous unions.According to the enclosed pictorial schedule, a division into seventeenspecialist groups is envisaged. This number will increase to eighteen if themajority of workers from the railway and postal services form a special tradegroup.&quot;Berlin.15. When we reached Berlin we found that the movement was much moreconfused than in either the Ruhr or Hamburg. Before the division of Berlininto the four occupation sectors, the Russian Army was in sole command, and inJune Marshal Zhukov issued Order 2, which allowed the commencement of tradeunion organisation. (When the three remaining Powers came to Berlin they recognised Order 2, as well as other Orders issued by Marshal Zhukov.) a central Committee of eight members (four Communists, two Social Democratsand two Christian Democrats) was formed and began to organise an overall tradeunion organisation for eighteen groups all over Berlin. This Committee hasnot been elected in the democratic sense, and no written or printed constitution for the union has yet been made public. The Berlin trade union representativesinformed us that the Constitution is nearly ready and would be issued in three or four months. An application for recognition made to the Kommandatura (FourMilitary Commanders) in September 1945, produced a reply that before per-mission could be given to hold elections, details of nominations, voting, &amp;c., hadto be supplied. In view of the inability of the Central Committee to submit agreed proposals for elections, the Kommandatura instructed its Man-power Committee(on which all four Powers are represented) to draft rules for holding elections.Agreement was reached on the method for holding elections, but not on the[31125] b 2
recognition of delegates already elected, the British, American and French repre-sentatives demanding that new elections should be held to which everyone should submit himself, and the Russians being insistent that delegates already electedshould be recognised. This difference has not yet been resolved, but the Berlintrade union representatives admitted to us that a number of irregularities had occurred in the election of some delegates.Letter, to Ruhr Committee.16. Probably the best way of describing the views of the Delegation on theabove problems is to quote in full a letter addressed to the Ruhr trade unionistsafter meeting the trade unionists in Hamburg and Berlin. This letter, datedthe 27th November, is as follows   -&quot;This letter fulfils the promise we made to you. on Friday that wewould carefully think over the discussion we had with you on that day andwould write you after we had seen more of the conditions in Germany.&apos;&apos; We are very glad that you have decided that religious, racial andpolitical opinions shall not divide you in the future. The strength of theBritish Trade Union Movement would largely disappear if we in Englandallowed non-industrial matters of this sort to dominate and divide us. Weare sure that this decision will eventually make your Movement stronger andmore efficient.&quot; But we are disturbed about your desire to have no Trade Union forthe North Rhine Province, even if you have separate sections for each industry. Even if this desire comes from the workers, we feel it will mean in practice that all effective power will ultimately reside in a small group ofmen at the top. Although arrived at by a different path, this will be the same position as when the Nazis took power. -Once again the rank and file willwait for orders from the centre, and it may be that once again, some timein the future, a German Government may disrupt your movement by arrestsat Headquarters level.&quot; The result of our experience, as representing the oldest Trade union movement in the world, is that, important as organisational structure is,the strength of Trade Unionism depends largely upon the intelligence and enthusiasm of the members in the factories and pits, and upon their active participation in all decisions. And we feel that if the workers are too farremoved from the centre (as they may well be in one huge Trade Union)they will lose interest and merely obey orders.&quot; We feel, in all sincerity, that the great weakness of the german trade Unionists is this tendency in the German people to blindly obeyinstructions from Headquarters.&quot; We, therefore, as representatives of a great Trade Union Movement,which sincerely desires to see a real democracy in Germany, ask you tomodify your plan so that a small number of Unions shall have completeautonomy over the industrial affairs of their members.&quot; In order to have one body to co-ordinate general industrial policy,we recommend that a Confederation be formed with authority to co-coordinate the policy of the Unions, negotiate with the Military Government and be generally responsible for the welfare of German Trade Unionists, without,however, having authority to interfere with the autonomy of any Union inmatters affecting that Union alone.&apos;&apos; In view of the importance of early agreement on uniform structure of Trade Union organisation in the British zone, and ultimately through-out the whole of Germany, we have requested the British authorities toarrange, at the earliest possible date, a meeting between two or three repre-sentatives of the Hamburg and Ruhr groups at which the question may be fully discussed.&quot;17. We feel that this urge for centralisation must be replaced by a live and active Movement so organised as to give the rank and file members a realvoice in the government of their Union. In this connection, we record with regret that a local officer of the Berlin Movement, in announcing the plans foran election, says : &quot; Everyone who does not participate in the election will be looked upon as a selfish saboteur of the trade union movement and the anti-Fascist front and will be treated as a Nazi.&quot;   (See Appendix &quot; B.&quot;)
Relations between Military Government and the Trade Union Groups.18. The complaint was made in the Ruhr that difficulties were put inthe way of the trade unions through the British Section of Military Government&apos;refusal so far to give the requisite permission for the holding of the inauguralmeetings in the various districts.19. It was put to the Ruhr representatives by the representatives of theBritish authorities, in our presence, that whereas every possible encouragementwas given for the formation of trade unions, there were two main reasons whyon several occasions it was impossible for permission to be given, either (1) that the men who made the applications were found on enquiry to beNazis; or(2) that assurance was necessary that the applications came from the potential membership and not from trade union leaders umemployed for 12 years.20. Special reference was made to the case of dusseldorf, where the reasongiven for delay was that subsequent to the receipt of the application in question,the Ruhr trade union group had opened discussion on the establishment of a trade union organisation covering the whole of the Province. Accordingly, theBritish authorities had considered the local question to be included in, and to await decision on, the main question of trade union organisation of the wholeRuhr.   The German representatives did not further contest this point.21. Bearing on this, we were informed that in many places the british authorities have given the local trade union groups facilities to use pre-1933trade union premises. The Delegation actually met in the Hamburg trade unionbuilding, and were invited to visit the Berlin trade union premises, but timedid not permit.. -The Berlin Unions.22. The representatives of the Berlin trade unions stated that, apart fromtheir work of trade union organisation, they had assisted the officers of the berlin City Council dealing with questions of production, transport and food.They informed us that the City Administration consults the trade unions on matters of welfare activity and all questions affecting the social and economic progress of the city.23. They had proceeded far in respect of technical organisation, withprinted membership card, a membership card index, a weekly trade unionjournal, facilities in the daily press and on the Berlin radio. They suppliedus, just before our departure, with copies of their literature, which we did nothave the opportunity of examining.24. In connection with the work of education of the German people bythe trade unions, the Berlin representatives said that they shared the mistrustof the whole German nation felt by other nations, since they themselves had beenput into concentration camps and prisons by Germans.Co-operative Movement.25. Although not within our Terms of Reference, we have given some consideration to the resuscitation of the German Co-operative Movement as afurther means of encouraging democracy in Germany. We understand that anumber of Co-operative factories (mainly food-processing plants) are in produc-tion, and as raw materials become available, others, now idle, will resume their normal activities.Denazification.26 In the Ruhr in particular we found that intense indignation existsat the continued employment of Nazis in administrative positions. This, it was stated results in victimisation of men returning from concentration camps andprisons We discussed this question with the North Rhine Coal( Control. Itwas agreed that there was justification in the complaint and that screeningwas being pursued with vigour. The fact remains, however, that if everyex-member of the Nazi party were removed, some administrative departments would lose up to 80 per cent, of their personnel, and the production of coal[31125] B
would be seriously hampered. Only ardent Nazis are therefore being removedat present. We heard complaints on this score at Hamburg (in the postal and telegraph services) and the Berlin Trade Union Committee was not satisfied withthe present position. This situation has an obvious reaction upon the employers&apos;organisations. So far as we could discover, a few Chambers of Commerce appearto be the only organisations of this nature in existence.War Guilt.27. At each conference with German Trade Unionists the Delegation hasreminded them that they owe their liberation to the Allied armies and not to theirown exertions. They have also been told quite frankly that it will be a long time before the Trade Unionists in Allied countries forgave the German people. Ineach instance the Germans have frankly admitted this, but have pleaded thatnumbers of Trade Unionists were imprisoned and killed by the Nazis.Recom mendations.28. In accordance with the invitation of the Secretary of State, we recommended-mend : (1) That every effort should be made to stimulate and encourage the formationof free German Trade Unions with democratically elected officers, inorder to counteract the desire for one all-inclusive Trade Union.(2) That the time has arrived to give increased facilities to Trade Unionsdemocratically elected in order to build up their resources by (a) permitting the unions in a large industrial centre to extend their activities into the adjoining areas;(&amp;) instituting a Trade Union journal to be produced by german trade Unionists (under censorship) for all areas in the british zone;(c) leasing at nominal rents the available Trade Union buildings for meetings and administrative purposes;(d) facilitating the return of the approved German Trade Unionemigres on their own responsibility who volunteer to enter theBritish Zone, on condition that no attempt is made to imposethem upon the Unions concerned;(e) consideration being given to the reintroduction of pre-Hitlerworking conditions as soon as practicable;(/) provision of transport facilities to allow two or three prominentTrade Union representatives from the Ruhr (North RhineProvince) to attend meetings with the leaders of the HamburgUnions; and(g) arrangements being made in appropriate cases (e.g., miners) fordelegations from England to meet their &quot; opposite numbers &quot;in order to discuss organisational and technical problems.A rrangements for the Tour.29. The Delegation oannot speak too highly of the arrangements for theircomfort and the provisions for meeting representative people which were madeby the Man-Power Division of the British Element of the Control Commission.They went to great pains to bring representative German trade unionists to meet us from long distances (a no mean task in view of the absence of transport facilities), their files and records were placed at the disposal of the Delegation,and all requests for information were met. We came away with the firm con-viction that, from the Chief of the Division downwards, they form a first-classteam, of which any country could be proud. We were quite prepared to believethat the British Zone was the best-governed portion of Germany.H. L. BULLOCK,WILL LAWTHER,JACK TANNER,E. P. HARRIES (Secretary).
