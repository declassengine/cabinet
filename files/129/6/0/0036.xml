(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S S C R E TC.F.(46)5651ST JANUARY, 1946CABINETPROSPECTS 01  DRY CARGO SHI-PINGTONNAGE FOR 1946Memorandum by the Minister of War Trans-portMy colleagues will no doubt like to have before them an appreciation of the ^rospects of the dry cargo shinningprogramme for 1946.2.      At this time of the year, the immediate prospects for imports into the U.K.  are not as a rule favourable since theeffect of winter weather is felt in slower voyages, delays inports and increased repairs, while February is a short month.Much of the tonnage belonging to our European Allies which wehave controlled during the war has now been released back tothose countries and absorbed by their increased nationalprogrammes.      We are in a stage of transition and it istherefore advisable to look beyond the early months of theyear and to consider the position as it is likely to exist 4throughout 1946.3.      We are still in doubt as to the final action of the U.S.Congress in regard to American shipping, and whether or notpowers will he secured such as will enable surplus Americanships to be chartered to Foreigners on bare-boat terms for operation under foreign flags.      In his recent message to congress,  the President included advice that the pending-legislation should be amended so as to confer adequatepowers of charter upon the Administration;      Meanwhile Ihave not included the 3,000,000 d.w.  tons of U.S.  shippingnow on bare-boat charter to us in the figure of our tonnageresources given in paragraph 5, but we are now able to count on retaining this tonnage for some months and I indicate theextent to which our programmes depend upon this assistance.4.      I include in our tonnage resources approximately,000,000 tons d.w.  of Canadian shipping which, as a resultof recent negotiations, will continue to.be available to usunder hare-boat charter for the next two or three years, andI assume that the balance of the Canadian tonnage willcontinue to run substantially in the- trades and services which we have to cover.5.      Apart from the American bare-boat charter we then haveunder the British flag,, for the whole year, ocean going drycargo tonnage of 1,600 tons gross and over amounting to about16.8 million d.w.  tonss or, after deducting an averageallowance of 10%, for tonnage awaiting or undergoing repair,15.1 million d.w.  tons of effective shinning.      against these resources we have to make the following averageallocations throughout the year for services of high priority.      The allocations make no allowances forassistance to European programmes, or U.N.R.R.A., exceptin so far as it is provided in military programmes for civil\ XCOPY NO. -* O-1-

Parti;.&apos; owing to short-falls of cargo, imports in thefirst quarter are not txoected to reach more than,000,000 tons.      Thus, to fulfil the half yearlyprogrammes nearly 8f million tons would he required overApril, May and June, an average of nearly 3,000,000 tonsa month, a figure which on present indications is unlikely to he achieved.Allowing for the use until the middle of the year ofthe American ships which we now have on &quot;bare boat charter,and if I am able to charter on the market other foreigntonnage running under its own flag to the extent which Icontemplate, we may reasonably hone to raise our import to15.000,000 tons in the first half of 1946 as compared with13-g- million tons in the corresponding period of last year.8.      We should then be left with 20,000,000 tens to importin the second half to meet the programmes in full, i.e.  atan average monthly rate of import of 3.3. million tons.Even if sufficient shinning were available&apos;, there isconsiderable doubt about the availability of cargo on this scale, but the figures show the&apos; great importance ofsecuring,  for the whole of 1946 at least, the U.S.  tonnagenow on charter to us.9.      I have considered whether there are any other directions in which it would be open to us. to increase the tonnage a tour disposal.10.    In view of the heavy demands for reconditioning, wecannot look, for the construction in 1946 of more than14: million d.w.  tons of new tonnage, which my. estimatesassume.      I hope that the tonnage immobilised while under repair in U.K. ports, which at 31st December stood at.1 million d.w.  tons may be diminished,11.    The other means of augmenting our resources, are:-(i) a restriction of exports, which is obviouslyinexpedient;(ii) curtailment of the tonnage provisionallyallocated to the cross trades and of the revival of our position as world carriers,which is equally undesirable;(iii) heavier chartering of foreign tonnage, which must-be paid for in dollars, and(iv) a more rapid reduction in the amount of tonnagestill employed, on naval aid military services.12.    It will be seen from the above figures that a highpercentage of our total resources is still to be locked upin naval and military service throughout 1946, although itis true that the military -programmes embrace some commodities which would be required in any case for the avoidance of unrest in occupied countries or in territories abroad, orthe maintenance of their economy.15.    The tonnage allocated to naval  and military purposes atthe beginning of the year (as distinct from the averagefigures required throughout the year, which are given inparagraph 5) may be analysed as follows:-&apos;

million deadweight tons(a) Troopships   &apos; 1.2(h) Other Naval and Military-service 1.0(c) For Military shipments in theMediterranean .25(d) For Military shipments from u.K.  to North-West Europe .25(e) For Military shipments in theIndian Ocean and Far Fast 1.704.40This compares with the average of 2.7 million d.w.  tons which is the sum of items (a)  to (e) in paragraph 5.Both the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary ofState for War have been helpful to me in reducing demands anda special technical inquiry into the use of the merchantshipping in the SFAG areas has been arranged.      But theretentions for the first half of the year are heavy and itis this which affects adversely our importing capacity forthe year as a whole,  especially in view of the long time itwill take to render many of the ships, even after their release, fit for commercial work.      1 am bound therefore toask whether it is really necessary to retain so much shipping in the service of the Forces on military grounds, and whetherspecial steps cannot be taken to secure earlier release ofpart of the large number of ocean going ships now beingretained by SFAC or with the Fleet Train, esoecially ofthose vessels which would be most useful if restored to trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been generous in allowing me to charter for dollars, in order to make good ourdeficiency, and we shall be spending, apart from the bareboat charters and the cost of cargo carried in Canadian shins,about 10 million dollars in February on dry cargo ships and. afurther 9 million dollars on tankers.Even if we are successful in retaining the U.S.   ships now on bare-boat charter to us for the rest of the year, we shouldhardly achieve the estimated requirements for 1946, and thoserequirements are themselves in many directions on a meagrebasis.      An import of 55 million tons compares unfavourably with an average import of about 55 million tons before the war,and the amount of tonnage allotted in my estimates for serving the general economy of the British Commonwealth and forrecovering our places in the cross trades and general carryingbusiness  of the world is substantially lower than it must balfour we are to recover our position.The inevitable conclusion appears to be that,  on commercial and. financial grounds, we should make special efforts to reduce the amount of our tonnage locked up in naval or military service, though I recognise that this coursemay involve a review of some current policies.A.B.Ministry of War Transport31ST JANUARY,  1946
