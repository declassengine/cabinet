THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMJENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.Copy No.CABINET.CREATION OF LIFE PEERS AND OTHER MATTERS CONNECTEDWITH THE COMPOSITION OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think my colleagues will be interested to see a copy of a letter which I received recently from Viscount Cecil of Chelwood (Annex A) and the suggestions that he makes in the draft motion enclosed in it (Annex B).I may say that these are continually coming to me from one quarter or another. Personally, I have every sympathy with his suggestions Nos. 1 and 2.No. 3, however, raises considerations that involve wider issues. I feel considerablehesitation in supporting it myself, but I think it is right that the reactions of mycolleagues should be sought on the subject.I have received Lord Cecil&apos;s consent to circulate this note.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,2nd January, 1946.ANNEX A.Letter from Viscount Cecil of Chelwood to Viscount Addison dated20th December, 1945.My dear Addison,Some little time ago I ventured to suggest to you that a Motion in the Housemight be heard with advantage advocating Life Peers and the admission of women.I now enclose to you a draft of a Resolution on these two points and one otherwhich I suggest might be moved. Subject to any advice that you may give me, Ishould be disposed to put a Motion down on the Order Paper without any daynamed and see whether it excited any interest in the other members of the House.I feel rather strongly that the chief and perhaps the only use of the Housenow is deliberative, that is to say, to have such debates as we recently had on theLoan and on other matters, and also, perhaps, on some occasions to put forwardsuggestions about the various Bills for the consideration of the other House. Forall these purposes, what is wanted is the very best possible personnel we can get in the House, and that seems to me to be the best case for admitting Life peers and women to it.The other point is that, through no fault of any one, it frequently happensthat subjects of considerable, but not first-rate, importance are brought beforethe House and all the Government can do is to send one of its Junior members to read out the departmental answer to the point. That is what happenedrecently in the question of Hearing Aids, and also, to a very large extent, to thequestion of Road Slaughter and very many other similar subjects. Thatmaterially lowers the value of the deliberative part of the House&apos;s proceedings,and I therefore suggest that, subject to the conditions contained in my draft resolution, it should be possible to ask a representative of the department concerned, who is not a member of the House but who might be a member of theother House, to attend the debates so that he may give the authoritative view[31107]SECRET.CP. (46) 2.2nd January, 1946.
of the Government and also be able to answer any questions which unexpectedlyarise in the course of the debate.  I should be very grateful indeed if you couldlet me know what you feel on these points.With many apologies for troubling you,Yours very sincerely,(Signed) CECIL.ANNEX B.. Enclosure to Viscount Cecil of Chelwood&apos;s Letter, dated20th December, 1945.Viscount Cecil of Chelwood : To move 1. That it is expedient to create a limited number of Life Peers to sit and vote as Peers in this House.- 2. That women should be eligible to be made Peers on the same terms as men.3.
