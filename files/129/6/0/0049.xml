THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 49.6th February, 1946.CABINET.REPORT OF THE TRIPARTITE NAVAL COMMISSION ON THEALLOCATION OF THE GERMAN FLEET.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I present for the consideration of my colleagues the Report of the Proceed-ings and the Recommendations of the Tripartite Naval Commission set up inaccordance with the Potsdam Agreement to advise on the allocations of theGerman fleet and to handle other detailed matters arising out of the NavalClauses of the Potsdam Protocol.2. It was agreed at Potsdam that operable German surface units, includingunits under construction or repair which could be made operable within three to six months according to the type of ship, and 30 submarines should be dividedequally between the United Kingdom, United States and U.S.S.R., and that the delivery of the ships to be divided should be completed as soon as possible, butnot later than the 15th February.3. The Protocol instructed the Commission to make progressive reportscontaining their recommendations for the allocation of ships. With the excep-tions, to which I refer below, the division recommended in these progressive reportswas considered satisfactory and accepted by the Admiralty in the name of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in order to make transfer possible within the agreed time limit. Delivery of the allocated ships to the three Governments is now takingplace.4. 545 ships have been allocated to the United Kingdom, 590 to the UnitedStates and 654 to the U.S.S.R. I attach a more detailed summary of the acceptedallocations at Annex B. The fact that the British allocation is the smallestnumerically is due to exchanges, which were made by the British representative on the Commission with his colleagues, of some of the smaller unwanted unitsoriginally allocated to the United Kingdom for more valuable ships required bythe Royal Navy. The fast tanker, Nordmark, for example, was obtained in exhange for a number of landing craft. Although the agreed division gives usno German cruiser, we expect to obtain the results of the United States examina-tion and experiments on the Prinz Eugen.5. I need not trouble my colleagues with the detailed recommendations con-cerning matters arising out of the allocation of ships in so far as they are purelyof Naval concern. I need only briefly state that these recommendations propose the destruction of the inoperable and unallocated sihips within certain time limits;the further search for information concerning German ships which may not have come to the notice of the Commission^ inspecting parties; the provision of storesof various kinds to the allocated ships; the exclusion of Naval river craft fromthe proposals of the Commission; and notification between Governments of the performance of their various undertakings in connection with the report. all this is acceptable, but I consider that we shall be well advised to make a reservationon the dates by which the various classes of inoperable ships are to be destroyed,as they do not allow for any unforeseen contingencies beyond our control.6. There are, however, several matters to which I would invite mycolleagues&apos; attention : (i) The Commission has recommended that the three Governmentssimultaneously request that inoperable German warships at presentin the territorials waters of other countries be sunk or destroyedby the Governments in whose waters they lie within the time limitsproposed by the Commission.   Before accepting this recommendation;[31275]&apos; b
we must consider its effect upon France. We are aware that asmall number of German submarines were left in an inoperable state in French ports by the enemy, and that the French Navy is anxiousto retain them for training- and research. It is our policy to assistFrance in rebuilding her Navy and we are even going so far as totransfer to her certain German warships from our own allocation,including two operable U-boats. But the latter will be on loan and returned to us for destruction. While, therefore, we should, I think,,formally associate ourselves with the joint request recommended bythe Commission, we need feel under no obligation to press it in the face of a reasonable French objection,(ii) The Commission agreed a provisional allocation of German Navalharbour vessels and floating harbour equipment, but the british representative was unable to associate himself with his colleagues in the recommendation that this provisional allocation should be putinto effect, maintaining that as these vessels and equipment werenot part of the German sea-going Navy they are outside the com-competence of the Commission. In taking this view he was actingaccording to his instructions and was formally correct It is, I think,logical to regard harbour vessels and floating harbour equipment as capital equipment to be made available for reparations ratherthan to be disposed of as part of the German Fleet. But I doubt whether we could persuade the United States or Soviet governments that this is so, or whether we should materially benefit if we could.Two things, however, are clear, whatever procedure for disposal ofthis material is followed : the present requirements of the occupation authorities and the basic requirements of Germany&apos;s peacetimeeconomy must be met.I propose, therefore, that the allocation of Naval harbour vessels and floating harbour equipment recommended by the Tripartite NavalCommission should be accepted subject to the following reservations : (a) that the proposed allocations shall be scrutinised by the control commission to ascertain whether any items are necessary toGermany&apos;s basic peacetime economy;(b) that, if any items are withdrawn by the Control Commission, the tripartite Naval Commission shall make the necessary re-adjustments in the allocations;(c) that transfer of any further vessel or equipment required by theoccupation authorities for the operation of ports within theirzones shall be postponed until their requirement has ceased.I would further propose that the United States Government shouldbe approached with the suggestion that the British and Americanallocations of Naval harbour vessels and Naval floating harbour equip-ment should, as an act of grace, be put into the merchant shippingreparations pool, which is to be divisible between the signatories ofthe Final Act of the Paris Reparations Conference.(iii) The Commission has referred the disposal of floating docksto Governments without any recommendation. The Soviet representa-tives wished to recommend the allocation of all German floating docks:and the United States representatives to recommend the allocation of Naval floating docks. The British representative, however, insisted that the.se also were outside the competence of the Commission andobjected that their very considerable value required that they shouldbe divided on a valuation basis after an expert examination. Again,it is logical to regard floating docks as capital equipment rather than as ships, and in disposing of them the same considerations must be taken  into account as in the case of harbour vessels. It was certainly not our original intention that they should be included in the divisionof the German Fleet. Provided, however, that they are first inspectedand valued by experts, which has not yet been done, I see no objectionto their allocation into three shares by the Tripartite Naval Corn-mission on the basis of the experts&apos; valuation There is considerabledifficulty in distinguishing between Government-owned docks and commercial docks in Germany, and I believe it would be convenient if all were dealt with by the same Commission.
I therefore propose that all floating docks should be allocated ona valuation basis by the Commission with the same reservations asI have proposed in the case of Naval harbour vessels and that theBritish and American allocations should similarly be put into themerchant shipping reparations pool.(iv) There are some further matters upon which reservationsmust be entered in our acceptance of the report.(a) In drawing up the lists appended to the report, the commission have included as German warships a number of German mer-chant vessels. Some of these are the subject of proceedings inthe British Prize Court and some are actually in the employmentof the Ministry of War Transport. This may delay transfer to the United States and Soviet Governments beyond the15th February. A similar difficulty has already arisen andbeen explained to them in connection with the recommendationsof the Tripartite Merchant Marine Commission. Although itwould have been more appropriate for these ships to have been dealt with by the Merchant Marine Commission, I think wemay agree to their allocation in accordance with the NavalCommission^ recommendations, except in a few special cases.(b) Some vessels have also been included as German warships which arein fact Allied merchant ships. Transfer must in these cases be dependent upon settlement between the claimant Governmentand Government recommended as allottee by the Commission.(c) It seems advisable also to add a reservation to cover any errors ofomission made by the Commission in drawing up their lists,and to provide for resulting re-adjustments.7. To sum up, I propose that the Commission&apos;s report should be acceptedwith reservations on : (i) The dates for the destruction of inoperable ships;(ii) the date of transfer of ships which are subjected to British prizeprocedure;(iii) the exclusion of the ships which  the Ministry of War Transport considershould be dealt with by the Merchant Marine Commission;(iv) the settlement of claims by other Allies to certain vessels included inthe allocations;(v) general reservations covering omissions and errors;and with a recommendation that the allocation of harbour vessels and floatingharbour equipment including floating docks should be made by the Commissionsubject to the reservations I have proposed in paragraphs 6 (ii) and (iii).8. This proposal has been agreed at the official level by my Department andthe Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Ministry of War Transport and the ControlOffice for Germany and Austria and if it is acceptable to my colleagues, i suggest that the United States and Soviet Governments should be informed in the sense of the draft form of acceptance which I append at Annex D.9.   I append the following Annexes : A. Text of the Report and Recommendations of the Tripartite NavalCommission.B. Summary of allocations.C. Summary of dates for destruction of unallocated ships.D. Draft form of acceptance.A. V. A.Admiralty, Whitehall, S.W. 1.6th February, 1946.ANN EX A.Section A. -Report of Proceedings of the Tripartite Naval Commission,1. The Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States ofAmerica, agreed at the conference held at Berlin between the 17th -July and the2nd August, 1945 ,to &quot; constitute a Tripartite Naval Commission comprising twoT31275] is 2
representatives for each Government, accompanied by the requisite staff, tosubmit agreed recommendations to the Three Governments for the allocation of specific German warships and to handle other detailed matters arising out ofthe agreement between the Three Governments regarding the German fleet.&quot;2. As authorised by the above agreement, a Tripartite Naval Commissioncomprising two representatives of each Government was established. Therepresentatives were : Admiral G. I. Levchenko, U.S.S.R.Engineer Rear Admiral N. V. Alekseev, U.S.S.R.Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey J. A. Miles, K.C.B., U.K.Rear Admiral W. E. Parry, C.B., U.K.Vice Admiral R. L. Ghormley, U.S. Navy, U.SA.Commodore H. J. Ray, U.S. Navy, U.S.A.3. The Tripartite Naval Commission met in the city of Berlin, at the Head-quarters of the Allied Control Authority, between the 14th August and the6th December, 1945.4. The Tripartite Naval Commission established a Technical Subcommitteeto prepare lists of German naval ships and craft subject to allocation. Themembers of the Technical Subcommittee were : Engineer Rear Admiral N. V. Alekseev, U.S.S.R.Engineer Captain First Rank V. I. Golovin, U.S.S.R.Lieutenant Commander G. R. G. Watkins, D.S.O., D.S.C., R.N., U.K.Captain A. H. Graubart, U.S. Navy, U.S.A.Lieutenant G. A. Ivers, U.S. Naval Reserve, U.S.A.5. The Tripartite Naval Commission agreed that a combined inspection ofGerman naval ships and craft should be made simultaneously by representativesof the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom, and the UnitedStates of America. The inspecting parties examined German naval ships andcraft in Germany, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, theUnited States of America, and the ports of Liepaja (Libau) and Konigsberg.6. The Tripartite Naval Commission requested their respective Govern-ments to arrange that German naval ships and craft in neutral ports should proceed to the nearest German ports for inspection.7. The inspecting parties submitted to the Technical Subcommittee lists ofGerman naval ships and craft, divided into three categories of operability: Category &quot; A.&quot;-Naval ships and craft operable with no repairs.Category &quot; B.&quot;-Naval ships and craft operable after repairs requiringup to six months.Category &quot;C.&quot; Naval ships and craft which were inoperable, or thoseships and craft whose construction or repair could not be completed within six months.8. The Technical Subcommitee listed by types the German naval ships andcraft in categories &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; and divided the ships and craft into threeequally balanced groups. These recommended allocations were presented by theTechnical Subcommittee to the Tripartite Naval Commission.9. The Tripartite Naval Commission considered and accepted, subject tocertain British reservations (stated in Section C), the recommendations of theTechnical Subcommittee. AlloccXtion of the three groups was made by the drawingof lots. Thereafter, bilateral exchanges of individual ships and craft were madeas desired.   (Appendix 1.) &apos; ,10. Due to unforeseen and abnormal conditions such as reduction byseventy-five percent of fuel and power, working conditions in damaged building?during winter months, minimum rations for labor, and scarcity of spare parrsand material, the Tripartite Naval Commission agreed to interpret the time limitestablished in the naval provisions of the report of the Berlin Conference for thecompletion or repair of German ships and craft specifically as it applied to twenty-four destroyers and, in general, to other ships and craft in category &quot; B.&quot;to mean that within the said time limit those ships should be repaired sufficieinkto steam, and that sufficient available spare parts and materials be placed on board to effect a complete refit after the ship reached a port of the nation to which itwas allocated.
11. The Tripartite Naval Commission agreed that German ships and craftlisted in category &quot; C &quot; and all unallocated submarines should be destroyed.Stores and spare parts not available elsewhere may be taken from ships and craftspecified in paragraph 8 of Appendix 2 before their destruction, up to the allowance of the relevant German naval rate books. The Tripartite Naval Corn-mission further agreed to request their Governments to arrange that german naval ships and craft in category &quot; C &quot; at present in the territorial waters ofother countries be sunk or destroyed by the Governments of the countries concerned.   (Appendix 2.)12. The Tripartite Naval Commission prepared a list of ships and craftwhich were originally classed by the Commission as components of the Germannavy and were later determined to fall within the category of merchant ships, andwhich were, therefore, not subject to allocation by the Commission. (Appendix 4.)13. The Tripartite Naval Commission accepted a list, prepared by theBritish representatives, of warships and merchant vessels of Allied registry under british cognizance which had been requisitioned by the German Government and used for military purposes. The Commission agreed that these ships and craftshould be returned to their nation of registry in the name of the Three Govevn-ments. The British representatives agreed to accept responsibility for the accuracy of the list based on the best evidence available, and for the execution ofthe transfers without prejudice to any subsequent legal proceedings which maybe raised. Should any of these ships and craft subsequently be determined to beof German registry they shall be subject to allocation by the senior naval officersin Germany representing each of the Three Governments.   (Appendix 5.)14. The Tripartite Naval Commission was unable to establish exactly the location, condition and ownership of various ships and craft which had appearedon lists of the German navy. The Commission agreed that the senior naval officersin Germany representing each of the Three Governments should be directed tocontinue until the 15th February, 1946, the search for these ships and craft, andto obtain further information about them.   (Appendix 3.)15. The Tripartite Naval Commission agreed that stores shall be supplied to German ships and craft recommended for allocation, and agreed upon theallocation of responsibility for this supply. Stores, in this connection, includearmament stores, supplies and spare parts and technical documents. (Appendices6, 7 and 8.)16. The Tripartite Naval Commission considered the disposal of german naval river craft. The Commission agreed that these craft do not come underthe cognizance of the Tripartite Naval Commission.Section B. Recommendations of the Tripartite Naval Commission.The Tripartite Naval Commission agrees and recommends that : 1. Specified ships and craft of the German surface navy and submarine fleetbe allocated in accordance with Appendix 1.2. German naval ships and craft not allocated be destroyed in accordancewith Appendix 2.3. Search for further information on the location, condition and ownership of German naval ships and craft (enumerated in the second list of Appendix 3)should be continued until the 15th February, 1946, and that any such ships andcraft discovered be allocated by the three senior naval officers in Germanyrepresenting each of the Three Governments in accordance with the navalprovisions of the report of the Berlin Conference and the provisions of the reportof the Tripartite Naval Commission.4. Upon approval of the report of the Tripartite Naval Commission, butnot later than the 15th February, 1946, the Three Governments requestsimultaneously that German naval ships and craft in category &quot; C &quot; at present inthe territorial waters of other countries be sunk or destroyed by the Governmentsof the countries concerned in accordance with Appendix 2.5. The list of warships and merchant vessels of Allied registry which hadbeen requisitioned by the German Government and used for military purposes beaccepted.   The Commission further recommends that these ships and craft be

The Tripartite Naval Commission considered the disposal of Germanf-J naval river craft. The Commission agreed that these craft do not come underLf the cognizance of the Tripartite Naval Commission.Section B. Recommendations of the Tripartite Naval Commission.The Tripartite Naval Commission agrees and recommends that: 1. Specified ships and craft of the German surface navy and submarine fleetI be allocated in accordance with Appendix 1.2.   German naval ships and craft not allocated be destroyed in accordancewith Appendix 2.3.

Upon approval of the report of the Tripartite Naval Commission, butI not later than the 15th February, 1946, the Three Governments requestI simultaneously that German naval ships and craft in category &quot; C &quot; at present inI the territorial waters of other countries be sunk or destroyed by the GovernmentsI of the countries concerned in accordance with Appendix 2.5. The list of warships and merchant vessels of Allied registry which hadI been requisitioned by the German Government and used for military purposes beI accepted.   The Commission further recommends that these ships and craft be
returned to their nation of registry, in the name of the Three Governments, by theBritish Government, in accordance with Appendix 5.6. German naval ships and craft recommended for allocation be provided with armament stores, supplies and spare parts, and technical documents inaccordance with Appendices 6, 7 and 8.7. German naval river craft be excluded from consideration by theCommission.8. Each Government inform the other two Governments of the completionof transfer or destruction of ships and craft for which it is responsible, includingthe transfer of German naval ships and craft in categories &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B,&quot; thedestruction of German naval ships and craft in category &quot; C &quot; and of unallocatedsubmarines, and the transfer of warships and merchant vessels of Allied registry.9. The Tripartite Naval Commission be dissolved on the date of approvalof this report.10. After the dissolution of - the Tripartite Naval Commission, the. senior naval officers in Germany representing each of the Three Governments beauthorised to handle jointly any matters which may arise from the agreementbetween the Three Governments regarding the German fleet.Section C. Recommendations of the Tripartite Naval Commission, subjectto Reservation by the Representatives of the United Kingdom.1. The Tripartite Naval Commission recommends, subject to reservation bythe representatives of the United Kingdom set forth in paragraph 2 below, theallocation of German naval floating cranes and sheerlegs, naval barges andlighters, naval harbor servicing vessels, and naval tugs of four hundred and fiftyhorsepower and under, as indicated in paragraph 4 below.2. The representatives of the United- Kingdom state that German navalfloating cranes and sheerlegs, naval barges and lighters, and naval harborservicing vessels do not form part of the German surface navy (see paragraph 1of part A of the naval provisions of the report of the Berlin Conference) but should be considered as part of the equipment of a naval shore establishment and,therefore, are not subject to allocation by the Tripartite Naval Commission. TheBritish representatives further maintain that non-seagoing tugs are also partof the equipment of a naval shore establishment and are not, therefore, subjectto allocation by the Commission. For the purposes of the Commission, the british representatives agree to tugs of over four hundred and fifty horse-power beingconsidered as seagoing and, therefore, subject to allocation. The tugs Kvasefjord,Sperling, Tromsdalen and Bornhoved, although under four hundred and fiftyhorsepower, are considered an exception to this principle and hence subject toallocation as seagoing.3. The representatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and theUnited States of America disagree with the assertion of the representatives ofthe United Kingdom, and agree that these ships, craft and equipment are a partof the German surface navy and, therefore, are subject to allocation by theCommission.4. If the Three Governments agree that these vessels, craft, and equipmentare subject to allocation, the allocation shown in Appendix 9 is recommended bythe Commission.jSection D. Disagreement of the Tripartite Naval Commission.1. The Tripartite Naval Commission disagrees on the subject of Germaunaval floating docks.2. The representatives of the United Kingdom refuse to consider the division of German naval floating docks for the following reasons : (a) Floating docks are not part of the German surface navy and should,therefore, not be divided by the Tripartite Naval Commission, but should be allocated elsewhere, probably by the Reparations Corn-mission.
(b) Floating docks are very valuable equipment and should not be dividedby anybody by any arbitrary rule.(c) A sunken floating dock can usually be raised and with its long life ofusefulness is potentially of much the same value as a similar one nowafloat.(d) The floating docks in question vary in age and equipment, and theproposal to divide them on the basis of tonnage lift is unfair. Theyshould be divided on a valuation basis after expert inspection. Noinspection of any kind of German floating docks has so far beenmade by the tripartite naval inspecting parties with the exception- of a partial inspection of some docks in Norway and Denmark.3. The representatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and theUnited States of America disagree with the statement of the representatives ofthe United Kingdom, and agree that German naval floating docks are a part ofthe German surface navy and, therefore, are subject to allocation by the Corn-mission. They maintain that no more detailed appraisal is required for. theallocation of naval floating docks than was required for the components of theGerman surface navy recommended for allocation; they maintain that sunkennaval floating docks are properly excluded from a proposed allocation becausethey cannot be repaired within the time limit imposed by the naval provisionsof the report of the Berlin Conference; they further maintain that tonnage liftingcapacity is a suitable basis for allocation.4. The Tripartite Naval Commission, being unable to come to an agreement on the subject of German naval floating; docks, refers this question to the three governments for decision. A complete list of German floating docks, showingwhether they are considered naval or commercial, appears in Appendix 10.The Commission attached to its Report the following Appendices, whichare not Reproduced with this Paper.1.

Draft Form of Acceptance of Tripartite Naval Commission^ Report.His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered and are in agreement with thereport of the Tripartite Naval Commission, dated at Berlin on the 6th December,1945, and accept the Commission^ recommendations with the followingreservations : (i) A number of ships have been included in the list of German warshipswhich His Majesty&apos;s Government have previously considered asmerchant ships and treated accordingly while they were under british control. These ships are the subject of proceedings in the BritishPrize Court, and in some cases have been temporarily employed inBritish service; it may therefore be impossible to arrange for thetransfer before the 15th February, 1946, of such of those ships as are allocated to the United States and Russian Governments, but HisMajesty&apos;s Government undertake to effect their transfer with the leastdelay. A list of the ships in question is given at Appendix A. HisMajesty&apos;s Government is prepared to accept the allocation of theseMerchant ships recommended by the Commission, except in the caseof the two ships referred to in the footnote to this Appendix.(ii) A number of ships have been included in the lists of German warshipswhich are subject to claim by the Allied Governments, and HisMiajesty&apos;s Government consider that the transfer of these ships mustbe dependent upon settlement between the claimant Power and thePower recommended as allottee by the Commission. A list of the ships in question is given at Annex B.(iii) A number of the ships in the lists attached to the Commission^ reportappear to be identical with ships listed by the Tripartite merchant ship Commission.  A list of the ships in question is given at Annex C.(iv) His Majesty&apos;s Government, while hoping that full compliance will bepossible with the Commission^ recommendations on the destructionof ships and craft in Category C, cannot guarantee completeperformance by the specified dates if hindered by circumstancesbeyond their control,(v) As the designation and location of some units included in the report maybe found to be incorrect owing to uncertain or insufficient informationbeing available to the Commission, His Majesty&apos;s Government considerthat the lists appended to the report should be amended by the senior naval Officers in Germany representing each of the three Governments,in the light of any further information disclosed before the fulfilment of the Commission^ recommendations is completed, and any necessary adjustments in the allocations made accordingly.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that Naval harbour vessels andfloating harbour equipment should be allocated on the basis of the provisionalallocation given in the Commission^ report, subject to the followingreservations : (i) The Control Commission shall first fix the needs of the German peaceeconomy for harbour vessels and floating harbour equipment. In sofar as these needs cannot be met from non-Naval harbour vessels and.floating harbour equipment, they shall be met from Naval material,(ii) The Tripartite Naval Commission shall make any readjustments inthe allocations necessitated by the withdrawal from the provisionalallocations of Naval harbour vessels or items of Naval harbour equip-ment, to meet the needs of the German peace economy,(iii) Transfer of any particular vessels or equipment required by theOccupation Authorities for the operation of ports in their zones shallbe postponed until their requirement has ceased.It should be noted that some of the vessels and equipment included in thisprovisional allocation were commercially owned before the war.3.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that all German floating docks shouldbe inspected and valued by a sub-commission of technical experts and that theControl Commission should be invited to consider what floating docks are required[31275] c
for the basic needs of Germany&apos;s peacetime economy. The Tripartite NavalCommission should then recommend allocations of the remaining floating dockswhich would then be available for transfer to the three Governments. Thearrangements for transfer should be dependent upon the needs of the occupation authorities for the operation of ports within their zones.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to point out that the lists given in the appendices referred to above are subject to amendment if further informationbecomes available. Any necessary amendments will be notified through the SeniorBritish Naval Officer in Germany.APPENDIX A.Ships considered as Merchant Ships and subjected to Proceedings in theBritish Prize Court or Temporarily Employed in British Servicewhose Transfer cannot be Effected before 15th February, 1946.Name.Albatross, TugAlbert Forster, TugBora, Tug ...Bornhoveol, TugDune, Tug ...Duff el, TugEversand, TugFinkenwarder, TugFischotter, TugFohn 2, TugJan, Tug   ...Lumme, TugMarienburg, TugOhm, Miscellaneous VesselOrtrud, TugOstpreussen, TugSelent, TugVagesack, TugGoldingen, TugSuderpiep, TugAnna, TankerBrosen, TankerDora, TankerElse, TankerGrete, TankerHilda, TankerJeverland, TankerAchterwehr, Harbour TuCato, Harbour TugDorsch, Harbour TugElbe, Harbour TugFinnwal, Harbour TugKolibri, Harbour TugHelium, Harbour TugMerkur, Flarbour TugDanzig, Harbour TugHundius, TrawlerTrave, Chlorine CarrierRati. 7, WhalerRau. 8, WhalerA llocation.U.K.U.K.ILK.U.K.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.S.A.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.K.U.S.A.U.K.U.K.U.K.TJ.S.S.R.U.K.U.S.S.R.U.S.A.ILK.U.S.S.R.U.S.A.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.S.S.R.U.K.U.S.A.TJ.K.U.S.S.R.U.S.A.U.S.A.U.S.A.U.K.U.S.A.U.S.S.R.U.S.A.U.S.S.R.U.S.A.Note.
