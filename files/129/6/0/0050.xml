THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJBOTY^GOTBRNMBNTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.^CP. (46) 50.11th February, 1946.CABINET.PROGRESS REPORT ON HOUSING: JANUARY 1946.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.IN pursuance of the decision of the meeting of Ministers on the 23rd January(H.G. (46) 1st Meeting) I submit my Fourth Eeport. Attached to this report isa draft of the Housing return for England and &quot;Wales which it is proposedto publish before the end of February.2. Progress.The figures to be included in the published return will be based on the returnswhich are being obtained from local authorities.The first return from local authorities was a census of the position in each area up to the 31st December; this census undoubtedly meant a considerable amountof work for the local authorities and I am glad to be able to say that it has beenreceived from all but five of the 1,469 local authorities. For the convenience ofmy colleagues I append to this report a statement showing the progress up tothe 31st December in the form in which information will be given for later months in the published returns. (Annex A.) This statement includes particulars of licences issued for the erection of houses by private persons and of progress madein authorising the rebuilding of war-destroyed houses, showing the number ofhouses under construction and completed in each category. It also shows theestimated amount of labour employed on housing schemes at the end of Decemberas compared with the end of July and the distribution between housing and other forms of building and civil engineering.The total of additional units of accommodation up to the 31st December is New permanent houses Local Authorities ...      ...      ...      ... ...      229Licensed houses    ...      ...      ...      ... 893Rebuilding ...      ............ ....      178 1,300New temporary houses...       ...       ...       ... ...      - - - 8,446New temporary huts    ...       ...       ...       ...&quot; - - -      - - - 2,822New homes out of existing houses Repair of C (b) houses............... 64,652Conversions and adaptations    ...      ... ...      ... 8,606Requisitioned houses      ...      ... 15,090100,916The figures to be included in the published return will show the progress made up to the 31st January : these figures are now being tabulated in myDepartment.I propose in future to publish the return itself monthly and the twoAppendices which contain more detailed information and the statement aboutprogress in individual local government areas at longer intervals.I am arranging for a copy of the published return to be sent to every localauthority and to the provincial press, in order to encourage local patriotism anda spirit of rivalry between neighbouring districts.A separate statement will be published relating to Scotland. The latest figures of progress with temporary and permanent housing schemes in Scotlandare given in Annex B.In subsequent reports to this meeting I propose to repeat the statistical tablessimilar to those in my last report for purposes of comparison and also particulars of tender prices; but it has not been possible to do so on this occasion withoutdelaying the draft of the return for publication.
3. Rxural Housing.It has now been decided that responsibility for the production of prefabri-cated parts for houses in rural areas shall be held directly by the Minister ofWorks. A special officer has been appointed in the Ministry of Works to take charge of the scheme.Factories haye been selected in all parts of the country in which the concreteparts can be made, and arrangements are well advanced for the appointment ofsupervising contractors to give instruction in the production of the parts and theerection of the houses.The design of the house has been settled and arrangements are in hand for theproduction of the special moulds and erection jigs required for making the parts and building the houses. There is no reason why the concrete parts for 20,000houses should not be produced this year, but availability of materials and com-components will govern the rate at which complete houses can be produced and erected.It is intended that local authorities should invite tenders for the erection ofthese houses, making use of the parts supplied by the Ministry of Works and ofthe service which that Ministry is establishing for instruction to contractors inthe method of erection.4. Permanent Prefabricated Houses.Arrangements have been made for the large-scale production of certainapproved types of permanent prefabricated houses by a group of large firmsassociated with the construction of the Mulberry harbours, under the leadership of Sir John Gibson. The types of house included in these arrangements and thenumbers which it is hoped to build this year are--B.I.S.F. ......... 30,000Airey ...      ...... (numbers still to be settled)Easiform ......... 4,000Orlit ......... 2,000(The Airey house has also been selected for the scheme for rural areasdescribed in paragraph 3.)This scheme will be applied mainly to areas containing a number of urbancentres with a substantial housing need in close proximity (e.g., the Birminghamconurbation, South Wales) so as to reduce the cost of distribution. But it willalso, I hope, be of special assistance to some of the blitzed towns in other partsof the country. L have undertaken responsibility for getting the local authoritiesin the areas selected to accept the houses produced and to secure prepared sites forthem in advance.Some of the new types of house, at any rate at the outset, will be somewhatmore expensive than houses constructed by traditional methods and power isbeing taken in the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill toenable me to relieve the local authority of this excess cost where it is substantial.5. Requisitioning.Houses and flats held for residential purposes on behalf oflocal authoritiesFlats and houses of 12 rooms or less still held by the Servicesand Government DepartmentsDitto, released between the 1st May, 1945, and 31st December,1945  ........................6. Building Materials and Components.The present rate of production of building materials and components andthe estimated future monthly rates of requirements are given in Annex C.The issue of the Prime Ministers directive to the Board of Trade and other interested Departments has cleared the way for the speedy derequisitioning ofbrickworks and detailed arrangements are under discussion with the Board ofTrade. There is no reason to suppose that: the continued retention by Govern-ment Departments of brickyards will now interfere seriously with the manufac-ture of bricks.Proposals for the winding up of the care and maintenance fund have beensubmitted to the National Brick Advisory Council, who have agreed thatpayments for the stacking of bricks shall cease after the 31st March, 194&apos;).Ministry of Works Regional Officers are visiting as many as possible of thebrickworks which are not in reasonable production, in order to discover andovercome any particular difficulties standing in the way of production.96,92210,80022,700
A considerable additional allocation of block releases under Class B has been &quot;made to brickworks and the Ministry of Works have forwarded, through the usual channels, as nominated workers, the names of all pre-war employees in respect ofwhom the employers can furnish the necessary particulars.A scheme for giving priority in the distribution of building materials and components to housing and other high priority jobs is being worked out and willbe put into force as soon as it is agreed with all concerned.The labour employed on production of building materials and componentsis shown in Annex D.Labour supply for these industries still remains a difficult problem. TheMinister of Labour tells me that steps are being taken to exploit every possibility :both block and nominated releases under Class B; the nomination of&apos; workers whohave gone to other industries; the possibilities of training and juvenile entry;and the treatment of particularly difficult firms by the special Labour supply committee, are all in train. It is worth noting that the Table in Annex C showsthat during December, always a particularly difficult month for labour supply,the labour force of these industries was increased by over 5,000. everything possible will, I am assured, continue to be done.7. Building Labour.At the Prime Ministers Meeting on the 23rd January reference was madeto the question of demarcation. The Minister of Labour informs me that he is satisfied that the agreement reached last summer by the present Foreign secretary with the Unions provides admirable machinery for the submission of men togeneral craft employment, whatever their individual craft may be. He does lw-t,therefore, think that there is justification for calling the unions to a discussion and in this view the Minister of Works concurs. The latter, however, informs methat he will take an opportunity of mentioning the question of demarcation whenhe has his next discussions with the unions in order to ascertain whether any difficulty need&apos; arise.8. Building Corporation and Housing Association.The Treasury have agreed that the Ministry of Works may set up a Building-Corporation to carry out housing work at the request of local authorities withworking capital provided under the Building Materials and Housing Act. TheArticles and Memorandum of Association are in draft and consideration is being given to the appointment of Directors.In accordance with the suggestion made at the last meeting power is beingtaken in the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to enable meto finance housing associations established under arrangements approved by meto construct houses for local authorities. There is no intention of undermining the position of the local authorities. An association established in this way will only function either at the request of the local authority or, in the event of an authority being in default, at my request. In the former case the authority mayeither arrange with the association in the ordinary way to build houses which willremain in the ownership of the association and be managed by it, or the authority,may employ the association to undertake the preparation of plans and to erecthouses which will be handed over to the authority on completion. The associationwill be entitled to the usual contribution from the local rates and the financial effect on the district will therefore be the same as if the houses were built by theauthority.9. Release of Local Authorities&apos; Staffs.The present position regarding the release of local government staffs isshown in Annex E.10. Legislation.The following Bills affecting the housing position are before Parliament :-Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Bill.Building Restrictions (War-time Contraventions) Bill.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Bill.The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Housing(Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Bill were introduced on the 4th February.A.

They cover War Damage Repairs, Maintenance,Temporary and permanent Houses, New Construction and Civil Engineering. They do not allow for replenishing distributors&apos; stocks, which are in most cases at a low level, orfor exports.   Estimates have not yet been completed in those cases where no figure is shown.(2) Estimated Production Capacity This represents the estimates of production from the available capacity for the periods in question. Eor a number of items theestimated production is in excess of the requirements, particularly during the earlier periods. It will also be noted that current production is in excess of current requirements for certain items.   These margins are necessary in order to refill the distribution pipeline and later, to provide opportunities for exports.The attainment of the estimates of production for June and December 1946, is dependent on adequate labour supplies being available, particularly for iron castings, bricks,asbestos cement, plaster and for the ceramic refractories used in electrical fittings.[31289]Present Production, Requirements and Estimated Future Production of Building Materials and Components.

Housing Return for England and Walesas at 31st January, 1946This return is the first of a series of monthly progress statements on housing in England and Wales. The figures in the present return show the position upto 31st January, 1946.This first issue includes explanatory notes to the figures which will not be repeated in subsequent returns.   It also includes two Appendices : (A) General tables relating to England and Wales as a whole and to varioussubdivisions by types of authority and by geographical distribution ;and(B) a   detailed   statement   for  each  of   the   1,469  local   authorities.Future returns will be published each month to show a summaryof the progress made up to the end of the preceding month for england and Wales as a whole. The more detailed tables and thestatement relating to individual authorities as included in Ap-pendices A and B will be published at longer intervals:The Census of the housing position at 31st December, 1945, and the reportsof subsequent progress to be completed regularly each month by the localauthorities have been designed primarily as a guide to the progress achieved by the various local authorities and to indicate what further help or action may be required. The material contained in this return is largely derivedfrom the Census and the reports of progress in January.In explanation of the tabular statements set out in the return, the followingsummary is given of the successive steps taken since 31st March, 1945, to dealwith the repair of damaged houses and the provision of temporary houses andto authorize the erection of permanent houses.The provision of temporary houses and the acquisition and advance develop-ment of sites for houses had in fact been authorized before 31st March, 1945.(1) During 1945, however, the available resources of the building industry were concentrated mainly upon the repair of war damaged dwellings both those still in occupation and those so severely damaged as to be unfit for occupation without extensive repair. The needs of this urgent work limited,therefore, during this period the amount of work which could be undertaken on the preparation of sites for permanent and temporary houses and theconstruction of houses.(2) The Government announced that the programme for the provision of temporary houses would be limited to the number of houses which had been allocated to local authorities for England and Wales approximately 130,000.Under this scheme the responsibility for the acquisition of sites andfor the construction of the necessary roads and sewers has been generallyundertaken by the local authorities and the responsibility for the slabbing ofthe sites, which has to be carried out before house erection can begin, and forthe erection of the houses has been undertaken by the Ministry of Works. Theproduction of the hulls of these houses was due to begin in small numberssome time in 1945.(3) In April, 1945, i.e., before the end of the war with Germany, localauthorities were informed that they might apply to the Ministry of Health for permission to obtain tenders for permanent houses on sites ready for theimmediate erection of houses, i.e., where all the necessary roads, sewers andother services had already been provided.

(4) In June, 1945, local authorities were authorized to proceed without waiting for the completion of roads and sewers on sites for permanent houseswhere they considered this course practicable.(5) In August, 1945, all local authorities were instructed to put themselvesin a position to obtain tenders for permanent houses as soon as possible andv/ere encouraged to combine the necessary road works, sewers and other services with the erection of houses whenever it was considered that this procedure would result in better progress.(6) In June, 1945, the Government of the day announced that theconstruction of houses by private enterprise could be begun under licence. The granting of licences for the erection of new dwellings otherthan those in replacement of war destroyed dwellings is subject to conditionsas to size and cost, namely : (a) a maximum contract or selling price of  1,200 ( 1,300 in the LondonRegion) including land, roads and services;(b) an area limitation of 800-1,000 superficial feet in the case of two-storey houses and 730-930 superficial feet in the case of one-storey housesor flats.The price condition must be inserted in the licence and is now enforceable forthe next four years by virtue of Section 7 of the Building Materials and housing act. 1945.ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SITESDuring 1945 the energies and resources of the local authorities were con-centrated on the acquisition of land and layout and preparation of sites for the erection of temporary houses, but a considerable volume of workfor permanent housing is now being pressed forward. The following figurescompare the site position of the local authorities at 31st January, 1946, withthat at 31st July, 1945 (in terms of the number of houses to be provided) : AtSlst July, 1945Temporary    permanent houses Houses TotalSites acquiredSite development begun ...Site development completed at 31st January, 1946Temporary   permanent houses        Houses TotalSites of which possession obtainedSite development begun   ...Site development completedPossession of site obtained and de-velopment to be concurrentwith erection of dwellings(For details see Appendix A, Table    )

Rebuilding by local authorities can be begun withthe approval of the appropriate departments. The position at the end ofJanuary was as follows : Local Authorities Houses approvedPrivate Enterprise Houses on licences issued ...Houses construction begunHouses completed ...See Appendix A, Table  

527PROVISION OF OTHER HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONApart from new building, additional accommodation for family units hasbeen provided by local authorities in the period 31st March, 1945, to31st January, 1946, as follows : Conversions and adaptations of existing premisesRepair of unoccupied (i.e., severely damaged) war damagedpremises ...Temporary hutsUnoccupied houses  requisitioned by  local  authorities forresidential purposesTotal ...The number of family units of accommodation provided by the repair ofunoccupied war damaged dwellings and conversions and adaptations ofexisting premises undertaken by private enterprise is not known.A total of flats and houses of less than 12 rooms were released from occupation by the Services and Government Departments over theperiod 31st March, 1945, to 31st December, 1945. Some of the dwellingson release were requisitioned by the Local Authorities. The total numberof houses requisitioned by the local authorities for residential purposes was at the end of January, of these were situated in theLondon region.TOTAL PROVISION OF HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONThe total number of families rehoused in the 10 months&apos; period ended31st January including new permanent and temporary houses, destroyedhouses rebuilt and other provision as set out above wasBesides the provision of additional accommodation, dwellingswhich were damaged during the war, but not so severely as to be unfit for occupation, were repaired during the same period.PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL LOCAL authorities of the total of 1,469 local authorities there were at 31st January, 1946,authorities who had as yet no sites agreed for use for housing.   Ofthese authorities were urban areas and rural districts.Such authorities, of course, had no sites in any later stage towards theconstruction of houses.   Including these authorities there wereauthorities who had as yet no building schemes in hand.   The number of authorities who had not obtained authority to go to tender on a specific schemewas .   Some      per cent, of all authorities had schemes on which work had begun on the erection of houses. The detailed position of eachlocal authority under certain heads relating to permanent houses, temporaryhousing and to the number of licences issued to private enterprise is shownin Appendix B.See Appendix A, Table  HOUSING LABOUR FORGEThe total labour force engaged on the construction or repair of housing inGreat Britain, including prisoners of war, grew from in July, 1945,to at 31st January, 1946.

7281APPENDIX ANOTESGeneral note the completed Census forms relating to the housing position at 31st December,1945, were received mainly between 8th and 12th January, 1946. At 31stJanuary, completed Census forms had not been received from out ofthe 1,469 Local Authorities.Reports of progress in January were due to be received by 5th February.Reports received after 10th February arrived too late to be included in thefigures relating to progress in January.   By 10th February reports hadbeen received.Classification of Urban and Rural authorities the classification of Urban Authorities other than the L.C.C. and Metro-politan Boroughs into Large Towns and Cities, Medium Towns and Citiesand Small Towns has been made in terms of population. The classificationhas been made as follows based on the estimated population at mid-1939 asreturned by the Registrar General.Large Towns and Cities ......   over 75,000Medium Towns and Cities       ......   over 25,000 and up to 75,000Small Towns      ............   25,000 and underThe Rural Authorities comprise all Rural District Councils.The total population of England and Wales as at mid-1939 is divided betweenthe various groups of cities and towns and Rural Authorities as follows : Estimated        Percentage of total population        in England andWalesUrban AreasLarge Towns and CitiesMedium Towns and Cities ...Small Towns ...      ...      ...L.C.C. and Metropolitan BoroughsRural AuthoritiesTotal     ...............RegionsThe Regions used for the purpose of classification are identical with theCivil Defence Regions.

Sites have then to be acquired, a layout agreed, and roads, sewersand other services provided generally in advance of beginning the actualerection of houses. The actual construction of the houses themselves isthe final process in the chain of production, which also, of course, comprisesthe fabrication of building materials and components ready for use.During the early stages of expanding the volume of house building thenumber of house sites under development and the number of houses under construction and so on will continue to rise in advance of a corresponding increase in the number of houses completed. As the production of houses by Local Authorities evolves into a smooth and continuous cycle of operations,the number of houses or house sites at the various stages in the chain ofproduction will tend to be roughly equal.Table shows the number of houses at different stages towards completionbeginning with the preparation of house plans.Many of the initial stages in the erection of houses such as the preparationof house plans, bills of quantities and the chain of events leading to the acceptanceof a tender are, in many cases, undertaken concurrently with the work of developing the corresponding sites.
