3.0 /l---(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (u6) 3130TH JANUARY, 19h6CABINETHOME PRODUCTION OF WHEAT AND ANIMAL FEEDING STUFFS RATIONSJoint.. Memorandum by the minister,cr of A^riqulturG-and-^gcrotarjzof State for scotland in his memorandum about the United Kingdom wheat flour position, CP. (2+6) 26, the Minister of Food dealswith two questions upon which it is necessary for us to comment so that our colleagues may be fully aware of the implication of the Minister of Food&apos;s proposals before any decisions are reached.172COPY NO.   ^JSpring wheat     2. While we fully sympathise with the Minister ofFood&apos;s desire to obtain more spring wheat from home sources and will readily continue the propaganda among farmers tosow the maximum acreage, we see serious objection to his ,  ,proposal for a special bonus of  3 per acre as an incentive to achieve this objective.3* The objections are briefly as follows:-(i) It is contrary to the whole principle of theGovernment&apos;s price policy for agriculture which is designed to give farmers adequate notice to planahead.(ii) Cropping programmes are largely settled before theautumn sowing season begins.      Any disturbance isapt to throw them out of gear and lead toundesirable results.(iii) Emergency action of this kind would create a precedent which might cause serious embarrasment in the future and lead to demands for last minutealterations of prices to meet unforeseencontingencies hitherto regarded, as normal risks of farming.(iv)  The effect of the proposed bonus is highlyproblematical at this late hour. .   At the most itwould not increase the output of spring wheat bymore than 100,000 tons and might well be much less.(v) An artificially stimulated increase in springwheat acreage would, probably.be at the expense of barley which on the average gives a better yieldthan spring wheat and is more certain as a crop.

(yi) Partners who responded to appeals to sow wheat in the autumn (no directions are being issued for wheat this year) would severely criticisean extra payment to those whc failed to respond to such appeals.(vii) Finally,. such an emergency measure would shakethe confidence of farmers in the policy of awell planned agriculture announced in November .last.4.        In these circumstances we feel that this proposal should be the subject of  discussion between theMinister of Pood,  the Agricultural Ministers and theChancellor of the Exchequer.      In our view it would be farwiser to make a strong appeal to farmers using the B.B.C.and every other means to sow the maximum acreage ofcereals this spring.     By such means we might expectsome additional spring wheat bnd more barley and oatswhich would help to lessen the prospective deficit in supplies of feeding stuffs in 1946/7.5.        The feeding stuffs position as set&quot;out inAppendix I of the Minister of Pood&apos;s paper and his proposal to increase the flour extraction rate, must have serious repercussions on our reviving livestock industryand upon the production of meat, eggs and possibly of milk.6.        In April 1945 pig and poultry producers werepromised progressive increases in ration scales from Juneonwards.      At that time basic rations were allowed forone-sixth of the numbers of pigs and poultry kept onholdings before the war, with a deduction according tothe acreage of the holding.      Increases were to be broughtabout by successive stages culminating in the issue of rations as from May, 1946,  sufficient for the maintenanceof one-third of the numbers- kept before the war.      this undertaking was endorsed by the present Government and progressive increases to one-fifth and one-quarter, without an acreage deduction, have already been made.7.        Pig and poultry farmers (including men returning from the Forces) have already made their plans and enteredinto breeding commitments for the increase in rationsexpected on 1st May.      A special chick-rearing ration has,in fact, been available to poultry farmers and both pigand poultry keepers have been given official encouragement to expand their enterprises.      The whole tenor of theGovernment&apos;s agricultural policy is to provide stableconditions for agriculture to enable farmers to make suchplans, and in the policy announcement on 15th november last special reference was made to the advance breedingand other commitments which livestock production entailedfor the farmer.      It is useless for the Government to guarantee minimum livestock prices years in advance withthe object of enabling farmers to plan ahead if their plans are so soon to be upset by the inability of theGovernment to Implement undertakings in regard to feeding-stuffs supplies.      The policy statement also referred tothe anticipated and desired pest-war increase in livestock.Faith in the stability of the Government&apos;s plans for thepost-war development of agriculture and Government under-takings generally, will be seriously shaken by the failure to implement the promised May increase in rations.

Reduce pig and poultry rations from )one-quarter to one-sixth of pre-war )numbers from 1st May 1946, but no )acreage deduction. )An earlier reduction would be  impracticable except bydevaluing the coupon and this would affect all classes of stock drawing rations.      l.&quot;e must, therefore, urge thatsomehow means are found to meet any deficit during Marchand April.12.      Our colleagues should realise that the prospectivereduction in feeding stuffs supplies are likely to causedifficulties.in the winter feeding period of 1946/47 unlessincreased home production or imports of cereals can besecured, with possible repercussions upon ration scales fordairy cows next winter.     Furthermore, the increase in milk production and in the output of meat and eggs for which weall hope, must inevitably be deferred, for these all depend upon more not less feeding stuffs.T.W.J. W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W.1.30th January, 1946.Saving000 tons2038.       It would be still worse if existing ration scaleshave to be cut.      The resulting forced reduction of pig and poultry stocks after they have been built up to present levels, would be disastrous, both by reason., of thedestruction of confidence and of the resulting serious financial blow to a class of producers which has been hardhit by the &quot;war.      Inevitably there would be an appreciabledecline in the home output of pigmeat and eggs,  just at atime when the public is looking for a better supply of suchfoods.9.        Throughout the war the Government has never had to go back on its promises to the farming community about feedingstuffs rations.      It would be deplorable if the first year of peace and of the present Government&apos;s term of office wereto be marked by such a failure.10.     Actual issues of rations this winter have been belowexpectations and a revised estimate of prospective require-ments up to the end of September shows that there would be nodeficit if present ration scales are maintained and there isno change in the flour extraction rate.11.      To meet the loss of feeding stuffs arising from anincrease in the flour extraction rate as suggested by theMinister of Pood, we should need to make the following modifications in feeding stuffs rations:-
