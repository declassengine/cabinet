TH3S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MftJESTVS GOVSB.NMENT &quot;- .      -Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1946.Copy No..       J cabinet.SECRET.CP. (48) i.5th January, 1946.LONDON AIRPORT (HEATHROW).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. The Minister of Civil Aviation has submitted to the Civil aviation committee his proposals for the establishment of the main international airportin this country at Heathrow near Staines.History of the project.2. The proposal to construct a large civil airport on this site was consideredby the Coalition Government on a number of occasions and approval was given inApril 1944* to the sterilisation of the whole area required for the constructionof an international airport and to the development of the site in stages, first tomeet the requirements of Transport Command for an airport near London capableof taking the largest transport aircraft, and later as a civil airport. The militaryscheme involved the construction by the Air Ministry of a system of three runways(one of them 3,000 yards long and the other two 2,000 yards long), and this willbe completed by Mav of this year at a cost, with ancillary structures, of 3-8 million.The present proposals.3. The Ministers plan for the further development of the site for civil purposes, which will be spread over the next 8 years or more, is set out in the annexed report by a committee of officials (Annex A). Since that report further progress has been made towards settling the layout, and ultimately there wouldbe a runway system consisting of three runways in each of three directions. Theprovisional layout of the system, which is subject to alteration as knowledge and experience accumulate, is shown on the annexed map (Annex B). The boundaries of the land to be acquired would be substantially as shown on the map, but minor modifications within the total acreage may be made during the preparation ofthe necessary Bill.4. The site of the airport has been chosen after prolonged survey of theLondon area and is considered to be the only suitable one for a large internationalairport. The land and the surrounding country are exceptionally level and free from obstructions, the soil drains well and has good bearing qualities, and the meteorological record compares favourably with that of any other site in theLondon area.5. The existing site on which the Air Ministry is constructing the firstrunway system is held on requisition and would have to be purchased. It wouldalso be necessary to acquire a large tract of land to the north of the Bath Road,which at present bisects the site from east to Avest, as well as a number of areasadjacent to the present requisitioned site. The total cost is estimated to be 7 million and a hybrid Bill will be necessary.6. About 170 houses would have to be demolished in the area south of theBath Road as well as a substantial proportion of the 1,026 houses in the area north of this road. Moreover, necessary control of development in the area abutting onthe airport would involve &apos;&apos; sterilisation &quot; of a certain amount of land which could otherwise be used for building; or at all events the control of building. To mitigatethese losses the Minister proposes to give up Heston Aerodrome and the State-owned land adjoining it. It would be some years, however, before work begins onthe northern area.* W.M.

We have given careful consideration to the plan. We accept the needfor the establishment of a main international terminal airport in the london area, and we agree that Heathrow is the most suitable site. We also agree withthe Ministers proposal that the airport should be known as the London Airportand that the name Heathrow should be discarded.9. Purchase of the land required. On the basis of the provisional runwaylayout, we agree that the land proposed to be acquired (see the map at Annex B)is the minimum necessary for the purpose. Indeed, in view of the present lack of experience of the needs of airports of this size, and uncertainty about the trend of aircraft development, we feel that it might be prudent to take powers in the Bill toacquire in addition that part of the Cranford Park Estate lying between theproposed site and Heston x4erodrome, but excluding the housing development lyingbetween the eastern boundary of the Estate and the Bath Road. If this area should prove not to be required, there would be no difficulty whatever in disposing of it(probably at a profit), or indeed of any other portion of the area which may he found later to be redundant.10. Much of the land to be acquired is now in use for agricultural purposes and on some of it housing schemes are projected. The Minister of Health andthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries raise no objection to the proposals,although the latter feels that he must examine further the suggestion for theinclusion of Cranford Park before giving his full concurrence. Both ministers are anxious that local authorities, farmers, market gardeners and others, whose activities will be affected, should be informed as soon as possible of what isproposed and given as close an estimate as can be made of the date on whichpossession of the land will have to be given up.If the Cranford Park Estate is used, it will be necessary to ensure that theline of the D ring road on the Abercrombie Greater London Plan is preserved.11. A number of administrative questions of this nature affecting various departments and local interests will arise as construction proceeds and werecommend that the Interdepartmental Committee, which compiled the report at Annex A, should be kept in being to deal with them, and that representativesof the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health and theMinistry of Town and Country Planning should be added to it.12. Control of development in the area. The question of control ofdevelopment in the area around the perimeter of the airport also arises. Weunderstand that the local authorities concerned have been consulted on this andother relevant points, and any other interests concerned will be able to raiseany objections they may have when the Bill is introduced. The Minister of Townand Country Planning raises no objection to the restriction of development soas to ensure&apos; that there is no obstruction within 1,000 yards of the end of eachrunway and that, outside this area, building is restricted so as to afford a clearascent at the rate of 1 ft. in 50 ft. A provision on these lines will have to beinserted in the Bill which the Minister of Civil Aviation will present toParliament.* The cost of the land is estimated at  1 million.
It is suggested that consideration should be given to the purchase of thatportion of the land required to be completely sterilised from building. In anycase the Exchequer will have to pay compensation and, although the matter willbe less important when we get compensation and betterment legislation, theremay be advantage in the Ministry of Civil Aviation buying the land and leasingit for market gardening purposes&quot;, for which it is eminently suitable. In any case,to the maximum extent possible, consistent with safety, the extensive areasbetween the runways should be used for market gardening.Compliance with the height restrictions will involve the demolition ofSouthall gas holder; the Minister of Fuel and Power offers no objection to this.13. Payment of Compensation. Compensation will have to be made inrespect of the removal of the gas holder (the amount cannot be estimated as yet),and there may be other claims from owners of land abutting on the airport,particularly where sites are held for industrial development. The estimate of 7 million in respect of the acquisition of the site includes an element for normalcompensation, but no provision has been made for compensation for the impositionof height restrictions on buildings outside the area to be &quot; sterilised.&quot; This isnot likely to be heavy as the majority of development is likely to be houses and,presumably, there will be a height &apos;&apos; deadline &quot; of 35 feet.14. Road Access. As will be seen from the map at Annex B, the BathRoad (A. 4), which bisects the site, will have to be diverted. To accomplish this and at the same time to provide good road access to the airport, the Minister ofWar Transport proposes, and we agree, that a new motor road should be con-structed, parallel with the north perimeter of the airport, connecting the proposedsouthern Slough-Maidenhead by-pass with the Great West Road at Brentford.This in turn will be linked with a new road, known as the &quot; Cromwell RoadExtension,&quot; construction of which was suspended at the outbreak of war. Fromthe new Bath Road it is proposed that approach roads to the airport should be constructed. The cost of these works, exclusive of the Cromwell Road Extension,which would be needed in any case, will be  2-J million, and this is additional tothe construction costs set out in paragraph 7 above.15. Rail Access. Provision of surface rail access, no doubt, will ultimately be necessary, but we feel that more experience of the operation of the airport andits requirements in the way of communications should be accumulated before weembark on any substantial programme of works, which must necessarily be exceedingly expensive. In any case, shortage of labour would make impossibleany early start on a project of this kind.We see considerable merit, however, in the suggestion that the Undergroundline from Hounslow West should be extended to the airport at a cost of 1-2 million, and we recommend that a detailed scheme to accomplish this shouldbe prepared by the Minister of War Transport in consultation with the Ministerof Civil Aviation.16. Cost. The estimates of construction and land costs set out inparagraph 7 above have been based on ruling prices and we are informed that itis unlikely that there will be any marked fall in construction costs over the nextfew years, particularly as wages represent a large proportion of the whole cost.17. The total cost of the airport, including road and Underground Railwayaccess and necessary equipment such as radio navigational aids, will amount toabout  30 million. We understand that the financial aspects of the scheme havebeen discussed departmentally with the Treasury, but that, in view of the magnitude of the sums involved, the Chancellor of the Exchequer desires to reservehis position pending further discussion with the Minister of Civil Aviation.18. Revenue. We have been unable to arrive at any reliable estimate of the-revenue to be expected from the airport. There will be a number of sources of income, including landing fees (which ought to be sufficiently low to attractentrepot traffic), rentals for hangars and space in the terminal building, fuelconcessions and the like. None of these can be estimated with any precision atpresent, but it is unlikely that, at the best, we can hope to do more than coverbare running costs. Certainly we have had no figures before us that would warrantan expectation of being able to meet normal interest charges, much less amortisecapital costs.19.   Ancillary services. We have given some consideration to the questionof letting concessions for hotels, restaurants and similar ancillary services.  these will have to be provided, and if the airport develops, as we believe it will, the[31115] b 2
income from them should be substantial. We are reluctant to see these potentialities-tially very valuable rights pass out of Government hands and we suggest that consideration should be given to the possibility of running the more importantservices by a Government-owned corporation. In any case, concessions, particu-larly for shops, banks, tobacco kiosks and other enterprises which are not suitablefor public operation, should not be granted on long leases.20.   Following is a summary of our conclusions : (i) Subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the site at Heathrow should be developed on the lines proposed by the Ministerof Civil Aviation as the main international terminal airport for thiscountry and it should be known as the London Airport (para. 8).(ii) The Minister should be authorised to present a hybrid Bill for theacquisition of an area of land shown on the map at Annex B, andthat part of the Cranford Park Estate lying between the easternboundary of the airport and Heston Aerodrome, on the understandingthat, if further consideration of the runway layout should show thatthe latter area is not required, it should be surrendered (para. 9).(iii) Development round the airport should be restricted to the extent necessary to comply with safety requirements, and provision for thispurpose should be included in the Bill. The Southall gas holder shouldbe removed and the cost of compensation for this and other admittedclaims should be borne by the Exchequer. Consideration should begiven to the possibility of purchasing the land outside the perimeterof the airport required to be completely sterilised and leasing it formarket gardening purposes. If possible the space between therunways should be made available for market gardening (paras. 12and 13).(iv) A new road connecting the airport should be constructed between theproposed southern Slough-Maidenhead by-pass and the Great WestRoad at Brentford; a diversion of the Bath Road for ordinary trafficwill also be necessary. We do not recommend provision of surface railaccess until some experience of the operation of the airport has been gained, but we suggest that the Ministry of War Transport, inconsultation with the Minister of Civil Aviation, should be invitedto prepare a detailed scheme for the extension of the UndergroundRailway from Hounslow West Station to the airport (paras. 14and 15).(v) The total cost of the airport, including the provision of road andUnderground Railway access and necessary equipment, but excludingcompensation for the sterilisation of land outside the perimeter andthe imposition of height restrictions, is estimated to be about 30 million, based on present costs, which are not likely to diminishappreciably over the next few years (paras. 16 and 17).(vi) We have been unable to arrive at any reliable estimates of the revenue to be derived from the operation of the airport and we do not considerthat, at the best, income will be more than enough to cover barerunning costs (para. 18).(vii) We suggest that the Minister of Civil Aviation should give considera-tion &quot;to the possibility of running the more important ancillary services, such as hotels and restaurants, by Government-ownedcorporations. We recommend that where concessions are granted to private interests long leases should be avoided (para. 19).(viii) We recommend that the Inter-departmental Committee of Officials.under the Chairmanship of the Director-General of the Ministry ofCivil Aviation, should remain in being to facilitate inter-departmentaldiscussion of technical and administrative problems which may arise as construction proceeds. Representatives of the Ministry of Health,the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Townand Country Planning should be added to the Committee (para. 11).(Initialled) A.On behalf of the Committee.5th January, 1946.
ANNEX A.Report of Inter-Departmental Committee on Heathrow.Terms of Reference.At the Fourth Meeting of the Civil Aviation Committee held on the12th November, 1945, the Minister of Civil Aviation was invited to arrange fora committee of representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Ministryof Supply and of Aircraft Production, the Ministry of War Transport and theTreasury to be set up and to report on certain points connected with the Heathrowproject. The committee were to state the technical reasons for the choice ofHeathrow as the London airport, and for the size and details of the proposedlayout of the runways and headquarter building, and to produce estimated figuresof cost and profit to make it clear that the project was an economic proposition.2.   We have considered these points, together with some others raised at themeeting of the Civil Aviation Committee, and submit the following report.Reasons for Choice of Heathrow.3. The site for an international civil airport must be as close to London aspossible since London is the main traffic centre. If the main terminal weresituated in the provinces, with connexions to London by means of feeder services,not only would time be lost and inconvenience caused to passengers and operators,but there would be a large number of movements of small aircraft to and from london, with no net saving in the aerodrome capacity required. The site mustbe big enough to permit adequate development and extension for the foreseeable future. It must have a good weather record. It must have good drainage. Itmust be level, and the surrounding country must be free from obstructions inevery direction.   The soil must have a good bearing capacity.4. Modern aircraft, particularly those used for long distance services,require a long take-off and landing run and they climb and approach at a shallowangle owing to their high wing loading. The main runways at a first-class airportmust be about 3,000 yards long with clear overruns at each end. 3,000 yards .should be regarded as a minimum figure at an international airport such as is contemplated at Heathrow, which will have to be capable of taking the very largesttrans-Atlantic aircraft. Future aircraft, particularly those required for ultrahigh speed operation, are expected to need runways of at least the above dirnen-sions, irrespective of their size.5. We are informed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation that Heathrow is undoubtedly the best and, in fact, the only site within easy reach of London whichfulfils the requirements mentioned above. Over 50 sites in the neighbourhoodof London were surveyed before the choice was made. The site and the surround-ing country are exceptionally level and free from obstructions (with the exceptionof the Southall gas holder). The gravel soil ensures good drainage and it is ofgood bearing capacity. The meteorological record compares favourably with thatof any other site in the London area. Access, which is dealt with later on, is alsogood. Largely for the same reasons the Air Ministry selected Heathrow for development as a military transport aerodrome.Estimate of A ir Traffic.6. The number of scheduled movements (including both landings anddepartures) per day of British and foreign civil traffic in the London area overthe next five years is estimated very roughly as follows by the Ministry of CivilAviation : 	Total Number of Movements Daily.	Long Haul. 10 per cent.	Miscellaneous (Positioning Flights, &amp;c.) 5 per cent.	Continental. 50 per cent.	Internal. 35 per cent.1st year 2nd year ... 3rd year   ... 4/5th year	200 300 350 450/500	20 30 35 45/50	10 15 17 23/25	100 150 175 225/250	70 105 123 162/175
The volume of traffic after five years can only be guessed, but it must be assumed that in ten years&apos; time it will be considerably higher than any of the figures shown in this table.7. Heathrow with a single three directional runway system and limitedtemporary accommodation adapted from the R.A.F. huts now on the site, isexpected to be ready next summer. With these runways and extended passengeraccommodation, its capacity, when used for civil services, has been estimated at about 250 movements per day, although this would be reduced to about 100 move-ments a day in conditions of bad visibility. This estimate assumes that 12 percent, of the total traffic will fall within the peak hour, which is a most importantlimiting factor. If movements could be spaced evenly throughout the 24 hoursthe capacity of any airport could be considerably increased. The assumptionthat about 12 per cent, of the total traffic will fall within the peak hour is borne out by experience in this country before the war, and in America at the presenttime. Pre-war experience indicates a tendency for traffic to be &quot; bunched,&quot; andthis tendency, which is expected to persist, may result in peak traffic figures being reached during four daylight hours. Outward-bound traffic is likely to be concentrated between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. and 2 and 3 p.m., and inward-boundtraffic between 12 noon and 1 p.m. and 4 and 5 p.m. The peak hour variesaccording to the routes flown and may fluctuate as the airport is developed. Itis therefore difficult to forecast exactly at which period of the day these hourswill be. At Croydon before the war the peak hour was between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.,but traffic at mid-day and again in the afternoon created subsidiary peaks.8. Reduction of the movements to 100 a day in conditions of bad visibilityis a limiting factor which must be accepted at the present state of technical development. Generally these bad visibility conditions obtain in winter whentraffic is lighter. Owing to ground mist in the early morning they are most likelyto affect the first peak hour, but they do not always occur at the peak hour. Itis therefore reasonable to assume that on most days Heathrow, with its threerunways will have a capacity of 250 movements a day. When capacity is reducedby weather, services will either have to be cancelled or the surplus traffic willhave to be diverted to relief aerodromes in the London area. If air transport is to become popular and successful there must be as few cancellations anddiversions as possible.9. The estimated capacity of Heathrow will be increased considerably when a dual three-directional runway system is available, and when improvements havebeen effected in landing equipment and bad weather approach technique. when these come about there is reason to believe that the airport&apos;s capacity will bedoubled.10. It will be seen that even when two runways in each of three directionsare available the capacity at Heathrow will be insufficient for all the trafficoffering after the fifth year. Even when a triple runway system is constructed,there will be a need, so far as can be foreseen, for at least one other aerodrometo serve the London area, apart from relief aerodromes for use in bad visibility.But there are obvious advantages in centralising as much traffic at Heathrow aspossible.   These advantages are(a) The  traffic   and  maintenance  organisations  of   the  operators   arecentralised.(b) Connections between services are facilitated a most important con-sideration from the travellers&apos; and operators&apos; point of view.(c) There are economies in the use of land and in administration andtechnical services.Layout.11. To obtain the maximum traffic capacity it is desirable that a triplerunway system should be adopted at Heathrow. To ensure safe operations,particularly in bad visibility conditions, it is essential that two of the runwaysm each direction used for simultaneous instrument landings should be widelyseparated. A layout affording three runways in each of three directions must,therefore, cover a wide area. Adequate space must also be provided for hangars and for the terminal area. To reduce aircraft taxying distances to the minimum,this area should be located in as central a position as possible. Such an arrange-ment can only be achieved by planning the ultimate layout astride the Bath Road.The total area of land involved is, nevertheless, considerably less than would berequired for three different airports each having one runway in three directions.
12. The land which the Minister of Civil Aviation wishes to acquire hasbeen indicated on the plan attached to his Paper C.A.C. (45) 10. It amounts to4,219 acres and the cost is estimated at  7,000,000. 2,650 acres of this land arelocated south of the Bath Road. Although it is desirable to acquire the whole area now, small portions of the land may not ultimately be required and canbe disposed of without financial loss. The particular area required for develop-ment depends on tJhe layout, which has not been finally settled. A large numberof schemes has been submitted and the comparative merits of each are beingconsidered in detail by an Advisory Panel set up by the Ministry of CivilAviation which includes representatives of B.O.A.C. and aerodrome consultants.Number of Passengers.13. It was estimated in paragraph 9 above that when two runways in eachof three directions were available at Heathrow the number of aircraft movementoper day in normal weather conditions would be about 500. The seating capacityof aircraft, of course, varies considerably, but an average figure of 28 might beassumed. The average load factor can be taken at 60 per cent., which reduces the figure per aircraft to 17. On that basis the total number of passengers per day would be 8,500, of whom 1,020 would travel in a peak hour. It cannot yet be precisely estimated what the number of aircraft movements would be per day when three runways in each of three directions are available. Moreover, bythat time the average seating capacity of the aircraft may have increased. Ata guess the number of passengers per day might be 12,000-15,000, of whom about1,400-1,800 would travel in a peak hour.A ccess.14. Road access from London to Heathrow is better and quicker than toany other site of adequate size and will be further improved when the CromwellRoad Extension, which was under construction before the war, has been com-pleted. Further improvement still would be secured by the proposed new motorroad envisaged by the Minister of War Transport in his Paper C.A.C. (45) 11. Anew road would, in any case, be required in substitution for the section of theBath Road absorbed in the site of the airport, and it is considered that the methodproposed in the paper of providing high-speed road access to this airport and beyond, as well as a number of local roads, would be the most convenient. Bythis means the time taken by road between Hyde Park Corner and the airportwould be 30/40 minutes. The cost of these road proposals would be of the orderof  2^ million at pre-war prices or  3j million at the prices likely to be rulingwhen the road construction is carried out. Of this sum about  f million wouldhave been ultimately entailed in any case by essential improvements on theexisting roads.15. Express passsenger train services could be provided either via the GreatWestern Railway (Paddington) or the Southern Railway (Victoria), distancesof, say, 12 or 18 miles, to take about 15 or 25 minutes respectively. The Ministryof War Transport has not discussed the matter with the interests concerned,and the question cannot be approached in detail until the locations of theAdministrative Centre at the Airport and the Central London Headquarters asregards customs, bookings, &amp;c, have been settled. It is understood, however, that both Companies have considered tentative schemes. The shorter G.W.R. route(affording segregating services) would prove more expensive than the longeralternative S.R. route and would cost about  10 to  15 million, including rolling-stock of main line dimensions; construction might take 3 to 5 years. Even thoughthe number of passengers carried on rail were assumed to amount to 10,000 to12,000 a day it would be impossible at the present to arrive at a realistic estimateof operating gain or loss. The provision of express passenger services is not,however, an immediate requirement.16. Apart from air travellers, rail access should be provided for employeesat the Airport, who will number several thousands, and &quot;for sightseers. this may be achieved, in addition to the G.W.R. or S.R. routes mentioned above, by extending the Underground from Hounslow West for a distance of 2 or 3 milesat a cost of, say,  1 to  2 million. Rail facilities may also be required for airfreight, and this would pass by either the G.W.R. or S.R. services, as outlined above. Rail freight for airport and aircraft maintenance could most conveniently be handled by local trip over the branches from the G.W.R. or S.R. at times whichwould not interfere with the working of the express services; no estimates havebeen prepared for this as a scheme apart from the branches referred to above,but it is assumed that cost would be of the order of  -1 to  1 million.
Cost.17. The work undertaken on military account consists in the main of threerunways, control tower, some hutted buildings and taxiways. It also included the provision of F.I.D.O. at a total estimated cost of  600,000, but work on thishas now ceased. The main runway (3,000 x 100 yards) and its parallel taxiwayis now complete, and the two subsidiary runways (each 2,000 x 100 yards)approximately half complete. 75 per cent, of the whole work is finished and theremainder is expected to be complete by next May. The total cost of the work,excluding F.I.D.O. and the cost of land held on requisition, is  3,850,000. Ofthis  3,350,000 will have been spent by March 1946, leaving  500,000 to be carried forward to the next financial year.18. The additional cost of the civil development scheme, which will besuperimposed on the R.A.F. layout, cannot be accurately estimated until thelayout has been agreed. The best estimate possible has been made by the Ministryof Civil Aviation and is at Appendix. It has been based on actual costs ofwork already carried out by the Air Ministry on the site. The programme isshown in three stages : (i) up to the end of 1947;(ii) between the end of 1947 and the end of 1949;(iii) between 1950 and 1953.19. The total cost of the three stages excluding the cost of special road orrail facilities, amounts to  22,576,000. The civil and military schemes combinedgive a grand total of  26,426,000. Against this should be set the sale price ofthe land at Heston which is estimated to bring in  750,000. The net total thusbecomes  25,676,000.20. These approximate figures are quoted in order to give Ministers anidea of the order and spread of the expenditure involved in the scheme beforeauthorising the purchase of the land. If Ministers agree that the scheme should proceed, the detailed estimates will, of course, be subject to Treasury approval in the ordinary way.21. We have not been able to arrive at a worthwhile estimate of annualout-goings and revenue on account of the number of unknown factors. Out-goingswill consist in the main of maintenance of buildings and runways, salaries and wages. Revenue will consist of rents for buildings and concessions (includingfuel concessions) admission charges for sightseers, landing and housing fees.22. Accommodation in the terminal building and in hangars will be leasedat an economic rent. Much of this accommodation will, of course, be taken upby the three State-owned British Corporations.23. At airports in America substantial revenue is obtained by letting con-cessions for restaurants, tobacco kiosks, shops, banks, &amp;c. Admission charges tosightseers also bring in a substantial sum. No opportunity will be missed toencourage such revenue-producing activities and it will be noted from the passenger figures quoted in para. 13 (to which should be added a figure forsightseers) that there is considerable scope for trading. The intention is thataccommodation for hotels, shops, &amp;e., should be let at the highest rent obtainable.The revenue from landing fees cannot be assessed at present, since there iswide variation in practice. The method of assessment is likely to be discussedbefore long on an international basis.Conclusion.24. It is essential in our view, which is strongly supported by the Ministryof Town and Country Planning, that the land should be acquired without delayso that local authorities and others affected by the proposals may know how they stand and be able to formulate their own plans. Speculation in land must alsobe avoided. If a hybrid Bill is to be presented to Parliament this session, itshould be ready for submission early in the New Year. If a decision cannot nowbe obtained it will mean that the opportunity of presenting such a Bill will be lost for another year.25. Although the area of land which the Minister of Civil Aviation wishes to acquire is undoubtedly extensive, we are convinced that the planning anddevelopment of the airport would be seriously prejudiced if it were reduced.Heathrow is a unique site.
