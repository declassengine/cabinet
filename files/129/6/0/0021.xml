TH1S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      v printed for the Cabinet.   January 1946.._-_:______5-3SECRET. Copy No.    38CP. (46) 21.23rd January, 1946.CABINET.ADMINISTRATION OF WALES AND MONMOUTHSHIRE.Report by the Chairman of the Machinery of Government Committee.1. During&quot; the last Parliament a Memorandum was addressed to the thenPrime Minister by the Welsh Parliamentary Party asking for the appointmentof a Secretary of State for Wales and Monmouthshire.* Though theMemorandum was not clear on the point, the claim may be presumed to be for separate administration in Wales and Monmouthshire coextensive with the separate administration now existing in Scotland. The Memorandum wasconsidered on this basis and evidence collected from all Departments which wouldbe affected.! Under the Coalition Government Major Lloyd George was broughtinto consultation, and the present Machinery of Government Committee have consulted the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Health intheir personal capacities as well as the Home Secretary.2. The whole question has been examined with great caret, and theCommittee strongly recommend that the claim should be rejected, for thefollowing main reasons : (a) It is undesirable to add to the number of Ministers.(b) The case for separate administration in Wales is not nearly as strongas in Scotland. Not only is Scotland an administrative unit more thantwice the size of Wales and Monmouthshire. There are also historical,differences (Scotland having retained the right to her own institutionsunder the Treaty of Union), and there is in Scotland, unlike Wales, a code of law, civil, criminal and administrative, different in important respects from England&apos;s.(c) In so far as the claim rests on the contention that Wales has been badlytreated in the economic sphere, the suggested change would not providea remedy since the Secretary of State for Scotland has, generallyspeaking, no direct responsibility for administration in economic affairs. Wales must be able to exercise her undoubted right to expressher grievances and to ventilate her claims, but the proper remedy for wales, as for Scotland, is to ensure that they both form part of asingle economic plan for the whole country and are not thrown back ontheir own sectional resources.id) Administratively there is little or nothing to be said for the proposed change. An extra element of complication would be imported intoGovernment administration, with consequent multiplication of officials and duplication of procedure both in Whitehall and in Parliament.Moreover, separate administration would be specially disadvantageousto Wales herself in such matters as police, prisons, treatment of offenders, probation, care of children, housing, &amp;c, since it would beimpossible for so small a unit to develop a system as efficient as ispossible when Wales and England are treated as a single whole. Thequality of administration would certainly suffer, since so small a unitas Wales could not carry a cadre of officials of the highest calibre andthe services of high English officials would no longer be available.Difficult financial problems would also be caused in relation to services,administered by local authorities.* M.G.

(e) It is true that there are differences in history, language (in part) andculture between Wales and England; but such differences, if they arenot supplemented (as are the corresponding differences betweenScotland and England) by divergences of law and constitutionalstructure, do not provide in themselves any strong practical case for separate administration in modern conditions.(/) The demand for a Secretary of State has gathered force in recent years;in particular, Local Authorities have only lately added their support.Possibly, however, it is now past its peak, having been due largely tolocal political considerations which are not now so important.3. The Committee have examined various alternatives to the appointmentof a Secretary of State, but they do not recommend any of them. These includethe appointment of a Secretary for Wales without executive functions, and the assignment to an existing Minister (for instance the Home Secretary) of a special responsibility for looking after Welsh interests in inter-ministerial discussions.Neither of these appears to be a workable arrangement.4. The Committee also considered the appointment; in the place of theexisting Welsh Reconstruction Advisory Council, of a permanent AdvisoryCouncil for Wales and Monmouthshire; and alternative methods of setting upsuch a Council were worked out for them.* It is difficult, however, to devise a plan by which such a Council would not become either a dead letter or a dilatorynuisance. In any event nothing short of the appointment of a Secretary of state would be likely to satisfy the most extreme supporters of the claim and theinstitution of an unsatisfactory alternative would merely create a demand thatit should be made effective.5. In the Committee&apos;s view, if the matter is raised, there should be a forth-right but reasoned statement by the Government, explaining why the appointmentof a Secretary of State for Wales would not be advantageous to the best interestsof the Welsh people themselves.6. This is not to say that the feelings and aspirations which lie behind theclaim should be ignored. Most Departments make special arrangements to ensurethat the devolution of administrative work to Regional Offices in Wales is suchas to satisfy reasonable national susceptibilities, that suitable personnel are appointed to such offices and that Government material is available as necessaryin the Welsh language. But there are some respects in which, without damagingthe coherence or efficiency of administration, devolution might be taken further.Moreover, it is important that Departments should avoid gratuitously offendingWelsh susceptibilities by, e.g., forgetting to consider the appointment of Welshmenor Welshwomen to appropriate Commissions, Committees, &amp;c. A statement of guidance to Departments on such matters should be prepared and circulated.7.   The Committee ask the Cabinet to agree : (1) That the claim for the appointment of a Secretary of State for wales and Monmouthshire should not be accepted.(2) That no alternative arrangement should be proposed by the Government,though further consideration may have to be given to possible -alterna-tives in the light of the reaction to the Governments statement.(3) That a statement of guidance regarding administrative devolution in wales and Monmouthshire should be prepared and circulated to departments under the authority of the Machinery of government committee.H. M.Office of the Lord President, S. W. 1,23rd January, 1946.* M.g. (45) 9.
