A ./Vw(THIS DO CUM .i;T 13 THE PROPERTY OP HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. &amp; YCABINETWORLD RICE situation memorandum by the Minister of FoodDuring my visit to Washington I discussed the worldrice position as well as the world wheat position.The two foodstuffs are closely related in that if riceeating countries are unable to obtain rice they demandwheat as a substitute.    With a world deficit of over *000,000 tons of wheat it is impossible to meet anyshortage in rice supplies from wheat stockse2,      On the best assessment which at present can be made,availability of rice during 1946 is unlikely to exceed3*1 million tons and this figure includes a figure of45J?000 tons from Korea,  about which considerable doubtis entertained.    After careful scrutiny of the demands of,all importing countries and after reaching agreement in respect of reductions in the demands of certainterritories, the total minimum requirements for theyear amount to 3.8 million tons or a deficit ofapproximately 700*000 tons.    In the Appendix to thisMemorandum I have set out the latest estimate of supplies and requirements prepared at Washington during ray visit.The deficit of 700,000 tons takes no account, however, ofthe larger imports which will be required by Java if thatcountry is pacified in the near future or of the demandfor 1 million tons for Japan which has since beensubmitted by the occupying military authorities.    In thesecircumstances no attempt is at present being made to bringthe figures for the calendar year more nearly into balanceuntil further information is available regarding the Burmacrop and in respect of the success of the. measures whichwe are now taking in Slam.3.      My immediate anxiety is in respect of the first quarterof 1946 and during my visit to Washington the Governmentof the United States of America were persuaded to agree tovery substantial reductions in demands for U. N. R.R, A, (China)and the Philippines in respect of this period in orderthat more rice might be made available for the 8.E.A. C.   area.Nevertheless the availability to 8.E.A.C.  during this period is unlikely to exceed 160,000 tons against demands amountingto 339,000 tons, unless additional supplies are forthcoming from Burma.S.JP. 0 RET C.P.

4.      Shipments to Indie, during the last quarter of 1945and the first quarter of 1946 amount to 74,400 tons.A requirement of g50,000 tone for the calendar year1946 has been provisionally approved but unlessavailability increases it will be impossible to meetthi::; demand to the extent of more than 500,000 tons atthe most;5.      Availability can bo substantially increased only if more rice can be obtained from Siain and Burma.    Si era,which is by far the largest potential source of supply,is believed to have an accumulated surplus from previouscrops exceeding 1.5 million tons, in addition to a surplusof at least 300,000 tons from the current crop.    It isproving impossible, however, to procure rice from Slam ata rate commensurate with our needs.    In my opinion this situation is duo to lack of faith by holders of rice inSion^s currency which in turn is fostered by our insistence on a free levy.    This levy was imposed because it was held that to pay for Siamese rice at even half the presentinflated world price would place Siam in a more favourablepost war financial position than the neighbouring territories which did not collaborate with the invader.    In light of thepresent acute world shortage of rice I cm of opinion thatthe paramount consideration must be the procurement ofthe maximum possible quantities of rice which can be madeavailable.    I believe that insistence on this free levy isa hindrance to procurement because holders of Siamese ricewill not exchange rice for ticals in circumstances inwhich, rightly or wrongly, they consider the tical islikely to depreciate as a result of the export of ricefrom their country without payment.    Furthermore, if adequate supplies of rice are not obtained from Siam,  the blame forfailure to procure them will inevitably be fixed upon his Majesty&apos;s Government for their insistence upon thisfree levy.    In these circumstances I suggest that our claim for free rice from Siam should not be entirely abandonedbut that it should be modified in the following manner:-There should be an assessment by the&apos; CombinedRice Commission of the quantity of rice fromaccumulated stocks and from the current cropwhich is surplus to Siam1s internal needs.That in the light of.such assessment a target figure for export during 1946 should be agreed.That any quantity of rice delivered to us by theSiamese during 1946 up to or exceeding the target figure should be paid for in sterling or in thecurrencies of recipient countries at prices tobe fixed by agreement between the&apos; CombinedCommission and the Government of oiam.That any shortfall from the  target figure shouldbe delivered free of cost over a period in1947 to be specified.These proposals have been submitted by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to his local advisers and Iunderstand that they have reported that the basic principleof the proposals seems more likely to succeed in procuringrice in 1946 than any other proposals yet put forward.    In acable received by the Treasury from our financial adviser inSiam he states that lie is in complete agreement with the basicp r inc simple e s o f t he s e pr op o s a 1 s.b.d.

(Intld.)    B. S.Ministry of Pood, W.1.29TH JANUARY,  194-6.6,      In regard to Burma,  the Governor of Burma has statedthat he cannot permit the export of further qnantitiesof rice from Burma until he has ascertained the quantitiesavailable from the current crop.    In these circumstances telegraphed the Secretary of State for Burma during mystay in Washington suggesting -to him that inasmuch asreceipts from the current Burma crop are now at theirheight and that any deficiency which there may be willnot make itself felt until later in the year,  the governor of Burma should be requested to permit the export of anadditional d00,000 tons of rice during the first quarterof 19d6, on the understanding that if, in the light of subsequent information on the current crop, it became apparent that there would be insufficient rice to meetBurma&apos;s needs, Burma should be entitled to claim refundafter 1st July next of any quantity up to the quantityexported in 19u7 recpiired to make good the deficiency.I added that in my opinion the old crop stocks which are atpresent being held in Burma are in the nature ofan insurance against a contingency which may not arise.7i      It will be impossible for me to issue any rice for civilian consumption in the United Kingdom, a practice which has been in operation for the last nine months.In the discussions at Washington we proposed that all european countries should be required to adopt the samepolic3r so that the limited supplies of rice in the worldare reserved for those countries for which it is enessential element in their diet.
