In pursuance of the decisions of the meeting of Ministers on the11th December, 1945 (HG. (45) First Meeting), I submit my Third Reportshowing the position as at the end of December.Except where otherwise stated, figures relate to England and Wales.Programme.2. In my two previous reports the interim programme for Great britain was shown as 400,000 permanent houses, built or building (including about 40,000war-destroyed houses and houses built by private persons) and 165,000 temporaryprefabricated houses up to the end of June 1947. Of the total of 400,000permanent houses, 100,000 were permanent prefabricated houses. This figureof 100,000 must now be regarded as uncertain, since arrangements which arebeing planned have not yet matured.A programme on a quarterly basis for the period January 1946-June 1947for permanent traditional houses is given in Annex A. These figures are being used by the Ministries of Supply and Works for phasing the production ofcomponents and materials. They will be revised from time to time in the lightof reports on the progress of work on the sites. *Progress.3. Statistical tables showing progress in both temporary and permanenthousing schemes between the end of July and the end of December are given in annex B.These tables include particulars of the number of houses completed andunder construction in Scotland where schemes for the construction of houses byLocal Authorities have continued during the war.In England and Wales house building by Local Authorities was suspendedduring the war. When authority was given for its resumption it was necessaryto institute a new series of returns from Local Authorities. The returns willprovide for (a) a Housing Census which will give particulars of the position as at the31st December, 1945, and of progress made up to that date;(b) a monthly progress report to show further progress in each subsequentmonth.In order to ensure prompt receipt of such returns it was considered desirableto discuss the form of these returns with Local Authorities on whom theunitialreturn will impose a considerable amount of work.The first returns were due by the 8th January, and in February a report will be made as to the position up to the end of January.The number of houses completed and under construction by Local authorities will appear in the next Report.I propose to publish full periodical information as to progress, as promisedin the House of Commons. The first such report will appear towards the end ofFebruary in respect of progress up to the 31st January.

Separate statistics for rural housing are given in Annex C.As regards the scheme for facilitating the erection of permanent prefabri-cated houses in rural districts, the methods of construction to which this schemeis applied must conform to three cardinal principles :(a) the components must be capable of manufacture in a number of centresall over the country without constant or highly-skilled supervision;(b) the method must be one which can be handled by small local contractorswith a large proportion of unskilled labour;(c) the method must have been proved absolutely sound in varying climate conditions.The only method which so far satisfies these conditions is the Airey method,and action to bring this house into production is proceeding. A satisfactorydesign is practically complete but difficulties have arisen over the organisation for arranging production and distribution. It was originally proposed to use the Fairmile Marine Company, but it is now doubtful whether this company would be suitable and the Minister of Works is considering whether he should assume direct responsibility.War-Destroyed Houses.6. Particulars of the progress made in authorising the rebuilding of war-destroyed houses are given in Annex D.Permanent traditional houses [Local Authorities&apos; schemes).4. The Secretary of State and I intend to fix programmes covering the next three years individually for each Local Authority within the wider ambit of athree-year programme for the country as a whole. This process will take sometime, as prior consultation locally will be necessary both to gauge more accuratelythe capacity of local resources and to secure the Local Authorities&apos; acceptanceof a programme which they can themselves regard as having been agreed withthe Ministry. These consultations will be carried out in England by my newRegional Organisation as soon as fully established (see paragraph 15) and a startwill be made with the largest Local Authorities.Individual programmes will be adjusted from time to time in the light ofthe availability of labour and materials.The numbers and percentages of the different types of Local Authorities withtenders approved up to the end of December are shown below.
Private House Building.7. The number of licences issued by local authorities for the erection ofhouses by private builders of which copies have reached the Ministry of Worksby the end of November is 20,778 (Scotland 223) (including 2,314 war-destroyedhouses). Information as to the number of houses built or under contraction by private builders is being obtained from local authorities with the new returns and-will be included in the February report.House Building Prices.8. The average price for the three-bedroom houses included in tenders sofar approved during 1945 as compared with the estimated cost of the presenttype of house on the basis of prices in 1938 and 1939 is given below : -1938-39.England and Wales 10 6^Scotland    ......      11   0At end At end At endOctober 1945. November 1945. December 1945.(per sq. foot.)20   11 21   0^ 21   1J20   5 21   1 21   2. The average shows an increase of approximately 100 per cent, above the pre-war figure. 51 per cent, of this increase is attributable to the rise in pricesof building materials, 12 per cent, to the increase in wage rates and 5 per cent,to labour costs which were not payable before the war (i.e., holidays with pay,guaranteed week, travelling expenses under the Working Rule Agreement and improved welfare facilities). The remaining 32 per cent, may be assumed torepresent the contractors&apos; estimate of the financial effect of the reduced outputof building labour, delays in obtaining labour and materials and increased costof plant, supervisory staff and other overheads.The recent increase of 4d. an hour in wage rates will have to be paid bythe Local Authority to the contractor in respect of houses for which contracts have already been placed, since the contracts include a labour rate variationclause. In view of the assurances of improved output which have formed a partof this settlement in the industry I should propose to resist any suggestion thatthe level of new tenders should be increased by the full amount of the increasein wage rates though it may be difficult to avoid some increase until there is actualevidence of improved output.Improved output is a matter partly of age distribution in the buildingindustry and partly of morale. The present unbalanced age distribution with an undue proportion of elderly men and boys will be gradually put right asdemobilisation proceeds so far as craftsmen are concerned. There is evidencethat an improvement in morale has already taken place on schemes for new building, and my officers are bringing this factor to the notice of contractors inday to day administration. Delays in obtaining labour and materials shouldtend to diminish as demobilisation proceeds and current shortages of materials are overtaken.The Minister of Works is responsible for the price control of most of theimportant basic building materials and the Minister of Supply for the price control of most building components. The details of the present position are set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 and Appendix 2 of paper H (45) 67 submittedto the Housing Committee by the Minister of Works on the 12th November.The Minister of Works has now set up an Expert Committee to enquire intothe financial structure of the Cement Industry and is also, in addition toundertaking a preliminary investigation into the question of Builders&apos;. Merchants&apos;Margins, keeping a constant watch on the price control position of the mainmaterials listed in Appendix 2 of the paper referred to above. The positionis kept under review by the Prices Sub-Committee of the Building MaterialsCo-ordinating Committee. The housing components for which the Ministry ofSupply is responsible amount to about one-fifth of the building cost of the&quot; traditional &quot; house. In the case of all the more important of these, the price at which they will be made available by the manufacturers will be fixed underthe terms of the blanket orders which the Ministry is proposing to place inorder to secure adequate supply. Action to place such orders had to await anestimate of requirements, but the necessary preparations to place the first seriesof blanket orders are now in hand. Under the method of price control in viewfor Ministry of Supply items, the question of fixing separate maximum and minimum prices will not arise.
At Annexes E and F I append for the information of my colleagues notes by the Minister of Works on building prices and on the efficiency of the buildingindustry.Requisitioning.9.

The present rate of production of building materials and components isgiven in the table at Annex G. The table also shows the estimated monthly ratesof requirements as at December 1945, June 1946 and December 1946. these estimates have been based upon the permanent and temporary housing programmesshown in Annex A. They include allowances for war damage repairs, main-tenance, permanent prefabricated houses, new construction and civil engineering and are a first attempt at securing a comprehensive picture of the requirementposition. The requirements have not as yet been calculated for all items, but thework is in hand.The table also shows estimates of monthly production for the same periods for which requirements have been shown. These estimates are also necessarilyprovisional. The attainment of the estimated production for June and december 1946 is dependent on an adequate inflow of labour being available,particularly for iron castings, bricks, asbestos cement, plaster and for theceramic refractories used in electrical fittings. In a number of cases the full capacity for production is in excess of the requirements as at present calculated,particularly during the earlier periods. It will also be noted that current production is, in some instances, in excess of the requirements as at presentcalculated. Insufficient allowance may have been made in the requirements fordeferred maintenance and this aspect is under consideration. In so far as marginsin excess of the real requirements are likely to be available they are necessary inorder to refill the distribution pipeline and later to provide opportunities for exports.It will be seen from Annex H that the labour supply is far from satisfactory in some of the most vital industries, but I am advised by the Ministers concerned that they are taking drastic action appropriate to the conditions of each industryto increase the amount of labour.At Annexes I and J I append for the information of my colleaguesmemoranda on building materials and components by the Minister of Works andby the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production.Building Labour.11. The estimated amount of labour employed on housing schemes at theend of November as compared with the end of July and the distribution betweenhousing and other forms of building and civil engineering is shown at Annex K.Release of Local Authorities&apos; staffs.12. The present position regarding the release of local Government staffsis shown in Annex L. It is believed that the returns from the Services showingthe numbers released are in arrears and an effort is being made to get more recentfigures from the local authorities. The Service Departments will then follow upindividual cases of delay in release.Legislation.13. The following Bills affecting the housing position are beforeParliament:  Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Bill.Building Restrictions (War-time Contraventions) Bill.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Bill.The Building Materials and Housing Act received the Royal Assent on the20th December.
Subsidies.14. The Secretary of State and I have now met representatives of theLocal Government Associations and proposals for legislation to fix the newsubsidies, both for England and Wales and for Scotland, are before the lord presidents Committee.Departmental Organisation.15. The Regional organisation of the Ministry of Health has been recon-stituted as from the 1st January. Principal Housing Officers with adequatesupporting staff are now stationed in each Regional Headquarters town. their main duties are (a) stimulating progress by local authorities;(b) dealing with proposals submitted by local authorities relating to theacquisition of land, approval of plans, tenders, etc.; and(c) co-ordinating by way of regular meetings of Regional representativesthe Regional housing functions of other Departments, in so far asthey affect the local authorities&apos; proposals.The Minister of Works has appointed a Director-General of building materials who is charged with the following responsibilities: (a) The supply of building materials for which the Ministry of works is the Production Authority.(b) The distribution arrangements for all building materials whether theMinistry of Works is the Production Authority or not in so far asthat Ministry has executive responsibility under the terms of thePrime Ministers note OP.

,.;ANNEX E.&apos; &apos; &apos;[ &apos; Building Prices.Note by the Minister of Works.&apos; :;;1. At the meeting of Ministers on the 11th December, the Lord Presidentsuggested that &quot; information should be given on what steps were being taken to check the alarming rise in building prices.&quot;i2. Details of the increase in building costs since before the war were givenin a memorandum and appendices which I had prepared in November for circula-tion to the Housing Committee (H. (45) 67). They showed the separate itemsentering into the increase in the cost of labour and materials respectively.3. In ordinary circumstances the great pressure of demand on inadequateresources might have been expected to be leading now to a serious upward move-ment in prices such as took place at the end of the last war, but in fact prices havebeen kept about stationary in the last few months as is illustrated by the tenders for housebuilding. The main reason for this steadiness is the operation of anumber of controls all working to the same end the building licensing schemewhich reduces the pressure of demand upon inadequate resources, the builders&apos;registration scheme which prevents contractors bidding against each other forscarce labour, the labour controls which make it easier to man the most importantwork without monetary inducements, and last but not least the price control ofbuilding materials.; 4: Since the memorandum (H. (45) 67) was prepared for the Housing Com-mittee, the Building Industry have agreed upon a wages increase amounting to4ti. an hour for craftsmen and 3d.-3^d. an hour for labourers. In itself thisamounts to an increase in present circumstances of between  40 and  50 in thelabour cost of the typical specimen house to which the figures in the memorandum(H. (45) 67) related. Side by side with this increase in wages, however, must beconsidered the question of output in which, for reasons given in paragraph 5 ofH. (45) 67, an improvement can be expected. The two sides of the Industry are themselves very much alive to the importance of increasing output and reducingthe cost of building operations, and they have announced that the wages increases&quot; must, if they are to be maintained, be followed within a short time by a decreaseand not an increase in the cost of building.&quot; The leaders of both sides have&quot;pledged themselves to secure at the earliest possible date an output at the 1938level,&quot; and for this purpose they are setting up machinery to promote a higher rate of production and to consider &quot;whether it is practicable to devise such a workable system of payment by results as would lead to a further reduction in building costs.&quot; I think there is no doubt that the rate of output will improve,though no one can confidently say how rapidly and how far; the Industry willnot, I am afraid, agree easily upon a payment by results scheme, but I am pursuingmy efforts to get such a scheme accepted. The question of output is dealt with further in my separate note on efficiency in the building industry.5. The prices of building materials are held in check by the price control.There have been a number of applications in recent months for price increases inthe field covered by my Ministry, mainly on account of increases in fuel costs and wages, but only in two cases (clay tiles and North Wales slates) has a small increasebeen granted (in order to meet wages increases). Any further increase in fuelprices will react on building material prices, and there is the likelihood that, inorder to compete effectively for man-power in circumstances of full employment,.there will have to be further wages increase, which again will react on prices.On the other hand, the increase in demand for building materials will increasethe rate of throughput, and this should tend to a reduction in prices; the price control will be exercised so as to take advantage of this factor. On the whole,subject to any serious upward movement of fuel or wages costs in these industries,I should look for reductions in prices in the coming year.6. The recent increase in steel prices is understood to amount to an averageof 5 per cent, over all steel products, but in the case of castings for rain-water andsoil pipes the increase amounts to about 12-j per cent., so that the prices of these goods will be substantially affected. Another very important consideration is thehigh price of timber. The figures in table B appended to H. (45) 67 show that whereas in 1939 the cost of bricks in a typical specimen house was  58 and of.timber plus joinery  53, by 1945 the  53 had become  145, while the cost of
bricks had risen from  58 to  91. I understand that a new Soft Wood PricesOrder is being made this month as a first step towards the decontrol of timber,which will fix prices on an ex-ship instead of an ex-yard basis, with the result thatusers in port areas will on the whole pay about what they do at present, but thatthe inland users will have to pay generally rather more.7. My Ministry is conducting a preliminary investigation of merchants&apos;margins, and I shall take any further steps that may be necessary to ensure thatthese charges are reasonable.8. Purchase Tax has been recently removed from a number of importantcomponents, but the Tax that still remains represents from about  7 to  15 ofthe cost of a typical Local Authority house according to the specification.G. T.Ministry of Works, S.W. 1,17th January, 1946.ANNEX F.Efficiency of the Building Industry.Note by the Minister of Works.1. At the Prime Ministers meeting on the 11th December, 1945, it wassuggested that a report should be made on the action being taken to increase theefficiency of the Building Industry.2. The Ministry of Works has been steadily working at the problem of efficiency in the Building Industry ever since its constitution, and a great deal ofpreparatory work was done during the war the benefits of which should now begin to be felt in a number of ways, as the industry recovers from the disorganisation of the war.Planning and Management.3. The first factor in increased efficiency is the avoidance of anything which prevents the worker from &quot; getting oh with the job.&quot; It involves the introductionof improved measures for planning the work and supplying the necessarymaterials. The work must go ahead without any avoidable delay. In thisconnection the report of the Committee on the Placing and Management ofBuilding Contracts, which was published by the Ministry of Works in May 1944,is a document of the utmost importance, indeed a landmark in the history of theindustry, for the previously divergent interests were all brought to agree uponrecommendations of great practical value in this difficult field. The report inparticular emphasises the need for planning the complete work before the contractor starts. By means of Time and Progress Schedules, of which specimenshave been subsequently published by the Ministry of Works, unnecessary delaysare to be avoided. The form of contract is on the one hand to provide for unifiedcontrol over the whole work, and on the other hand to ensure that the contractorhas a financial interest in good planning and management.4. Planning and management is, of course, both strategic and tactical. Inconnection with tactical planning, the Ministry of Works has made intensivestudies, in connection with the operation of the Payment by Results Scheme onsites covered by the Essential Work Order, of the relation between labour time spent on directly productive work and the total labour time. These studies have indicated great disparity between different sites and different contractors, thusreflecting variations in the degree of efficiency. The results have been published as a guiue to the industry in site management, planning of the work, and theestimation of labour and plant requirements.Use of Power-operated Hand-tools.5. The next method of increasing the production of which a single workeris capable is by providing him with tools. There are, of course, limitations onthe extent to which the use of tools is profitable, but the Ministry of Works hasmade a special study of power-operated hand-tools and has organised a mobileexhibition which has been touring the country since the beginning of the summer of 1945 and has already visited London, Nottingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Newcastle,
Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. The examination of tools and plant is continuing under the Chief Scientific Adviser and an ExperimentalStation for this and other purposes, where tests and demonstrations can he madeis being set up.   A suitable site and buildings have already been acquired.Time and Motion Study.v. 6. The third factor is the reduction of the physical strain on the worker tothe minimum, or, in popular language, making the work easy for him. an example is the well-known story of the loading of heavy steel billets. By teachingthe men to take short regular periods of rest, so that &quot;the physical strain did not become cumulative, a notable increase of the number of billets loaded per hourwas obtained. This is an issue of extreme difficulty. Improvement can onlybe based upon scientific investigation and tests, and&quot; any such investigation is always regarded with suspicion by the operatives. Nevertheless, it is hoped,under the aegis of the Ministry of Works Scientific Advisory Committee, to carryout investigations in these directions. In order to facilitate&apos;the work, representa-tives of both sides of the industry have been invited to join the Sub-Committeeof the Scientific Advisory Committee which is concerned with this matter andalso with other questions concerned with the improvement of the organisation ofbuilding work.Working Pace.7. The fourth and last factor is the working pace or the speed with whichthe individual performs a specific task. Lack of training and difference of physical or mental capacity produce differences in working pace, but what is ofgreat importance is the attitude of the worker to the work his personal desireto get on with the job. This may be stimulated by welfare, financial inducements,and leadership.Training and Apprenticeship.8. There will for some time to come be a shortage of skilled men, particu-larly in certain crafts, and two special steps have been taken to remedy this. a building Apprenticeship and Training Council has been set up to arrange forapprenticeship and training in municipal centres and with private employersand the aim is to make such arrangements as will provide 25,000 recruits for theindustry in a year. In addition the Ministry of Labour is undertaking at government Training Centres the training of additional workers, including menfrom the Forces.Welfare., 9. During the course of the war, the Ministry of Works in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour introduced a great measure of improvement inwelfare arrangements; a large number of Joint Site Committees were set up andSite Officers were appointed by the Trade Unions to help to remove difficultiesOn large sites. These arrangements were applied in the main to large and isolatedsites, but I shall try to secure the benefit of this experience for the post-war programme of work as far as possible.Production Methods.10. In considering the question of improved efficiency in the BuildingIndustry it is important to remember that in industry generally one of the most effective methods of making the work easy for the workman is to bring the workto him. This is the basic feature of mass production efficiency, but at present it applies almost entirely to work in a factory. Building work proper must be doneon the site, and therefore mass production methods are only of limited applica-tion. The Ministry are, however, actively investigating the use of conveyor belts,hoists and mechanical scaffolding for site work.Prefabrication and Standardisation.11. Much of the work which was at one time done on the site is now donein the factory by the prefabrication of parts of the building. In order to securethe benefits of factory production, production must be on a large scale, and tothat end, amongst others, the Ministry of Works set up in x\ugust 1942 aStandards Department and a Standards Committee to stimulate the preparationof. acceptable standards of size and performance for a large number of materials
and components used in building. This Committee has recently reported that ithas formulated all practicable standards in the light of current knowledge, andthat nothing further can be done until further scientific investigation, and!development has been carried out. It still remains for the British standards institution to promulgate many of the new standards based upon the Comriiittee&apos;srecommendations. This work is in hand. Meantime, the Ministry of Healthhas informed Local Authorities that a number of standard materials and com-components must be used in Housing Schemes, and they will also be adopted inGovernment building.Codes of Practice and Post-War Studies.12. Closely related to the standardisation campaign is the work that hasbeen done on Codes of Practice. Broadly, standardisation deals with materials and articles, while Codes of Practice deal with methods of using materials andarticles. This began with the appointment of a Codes of Practice Committee bythe Ministry of Works in September 1942 under the aegis of which enquiries weremade by a number of specialist committees resulting in the publication of a seriesof reports with the title of &quot; Post-War Building Studies.&quot; Eighteen of these reports have been published and a further ten are in course of preparation; theyhave dealt with such matters as plumbing, painting, lighting, and school andfarm building construction. The Codes of Practice have been drawn up on thebasis of these reports; they codify the up-to-date practice on the basis of currentknowledge and thus form a foundation from which further investigation anddevelopment can start.  They are published for the use of all concerned.Present Action by the Industry Itself.13. From the above brief survey it will be seen that the maximum amountof information on which improved technique in the industry can be framed is ready for the industry to use. Much of this, however, is necessarily long-term and it is, in any event, of less immediate importance than the recovery of theindustry from the disorganised state in which it has been left by the war. Themost virile of its members have been serving in the Forces and there has been a heavy wastage which will have to be made up by apprenticeship and training.The immediate problem, therefore, is to secure improved balance, physicalefficiency and dexterity, the maximum amount of zeal, and last but not leastimproved supervision and management. These matters must in the nature ofthings be left largely to the industry itself, and it is a matter of great satisfaction that, in their statement issued with the recent wages agreement, the BuildingIndustry has itself followed the line of suggestions made by the Ministry ofWorks for the appointment of Production Officers and for examination of thepossibility of extending Payment by Results arrangements.14. The industry has agreed to set up a special National Joint production committee with Regional Committees with the function of securing a higher rate of production. It has also decided to set up a Committee of Review whichwill contain co-opted independent persons, as well as representatives of theindustry, for the purpose of reviewing progress at regular intervals and indicating whether output has increased and whether that increase is reasonable.The leaders of both sides of the industry have pledged themselves to procure atthe earliest possible date an output at the 1938 level.15. By this step, which I greatly welcome, the industry has itself set upwhat is in effect a Working Party, and it is my intention to offer the industry the full co-operation of the Ministry.Collaboration between the Government and the Industry.16. Collaboration between the Government and the Industry is securedthrough the medium of my National Consultative Council which containsrepresentatives of all the elements in the Industry (the professional element, the contractors and the operatives), and also through a Committee of the contractors and operatives which meets at the Ministry to deal with problems arising inconnection with actual building operations. The latter Committee has beenappointed recently as the development of a system introduced during the war for securing the help of the industry in the execution of the War Building-Programme. Corresponding Joint Committees of Contractors and Operativesare being set up regionally under the Chairmanship of the Regional directors of my Ministry to deal with regional and local problems.
17. There is one final observation which I should like to make. building is traditionally an art calling for a high degree of craftsmanship and themethods of mass production are not readily accepted. The success of theso-called speculative house-builder, whose ability to sell houses in large numbersdepended upon his ability to produce them at a cost which the customer could afford, was largely due to the integration of design and production on factoryprinciples. The architect who prepared the design was required to pay due regard to production considerations. The whole project was carried throughunder a single direction and with a single aim the production of a good articleat the lowest possible cost. The importance of this point in the present housingemergency can be illustrated by the figures of man-hours necessary to constructhouses under the two systems. From the data at present with my Ministry it isclear that the &quot; normal &quot; building under the supervision of an architect and withthe usual multi-safeguards of quantity surveyor, clerk-of-works, &amp;c, adds about50 per cent, to the time taken to build houses.18. I am so impressed with these figures that I have arranged an expansionof the costing research work already in hand in the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;sDivision for alternative methods Of construction to cover the more traditionaltype of houses. To obtain data we have secured the co-operation of twelve builders(ten in England and two in Scotland, through the Scottish Housing Association)who, with the help of the Ministry of Health (and Department of Health forScotland) have been given special priorities for building sets of fifty houses.The builders concerned have agreed to have &quot;observers&quot; from the ChiefScientific Adviser&apos;s Division on the work the whole time and to place all their cost and other data at the disposal of my Ministry. I hope that by these very extensive schemes of co-operation with the industry itself we shall get first-handindications of how advances in efficiency may be secured.; g. t.Ministry of Works, S.W. 1,11th January, 1946.

In a number of cases the estimatedproduction is in excess of the requirements, particularly during the earlier periods. It will also be noted that current production is in excess of current requirements in certain cases.   These margins are necessary in order to refill the distribution pipeline and later, to provide opportunities for exports.The attainment of the estimates of production for June and December 1946, is dependent on adequate labour supplies being available, particularly for iron castings, bricks,asbestos cement, plaster and for the ceramic refractories used in electrical fittings.[31178]EANNEX G.

ANNEX I.Building Materials and Components.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.Programme.1. On my appointment as Minister, I set up a special Programming Branchto compile the building and civil engineering programme and to convert it intoterms of the various materials and components that would be necessary. Thework is being done in consultation with representatives of the Ministry of health and Ministry of Supply, with the result that the three Ministries are working on the basis of single master programme. Estimates have now been made up toJune 1947 of building materials and components needed to meet the whole ofthe National Building and Civil Engineering requirements.2. The estimates so far as permanent housebuilding is concerned, are basedon 375,000 houses built and building by June 1947. Within this total the division between traditional and prefabricated types is very uncertain at the moment,but a provisional phased programme has been drawn up for permanent traditionalhouses and as a preliminary figure 25,000 prefabricated houses of other thanpressed steel construction have been included in the table of requirements. this figure will be reviewed as the programme for prefabricated houses develops, and provision will be made for such amended figures as are found necessary.A phased programme has been drawn up for temporary house construction.Estimates of the probable future size of the building and civil engineering labour force have been agreed with the Ministrjr of Labour and after deducting the labour required for the permanent and temporary house programmes, the remainder hasbeen split in suitable proportions between war damge repair, maintenance, new building work other than housing and civil engineering work.3. Special investigations have been made by Quantity Surveyors for thepurpose of estimating the materials required for the various types of building.4. The estimated requirements of materials and components have necessarilybeen made on the basis of broad assumptions as to the type of work likely to beput in hand, but in the absence of reasonable detail of the building and civil engineering work actually planned it is not possible to produce more accurateestimates. All Departments have been asked to provide information as toprobable building and civil engineering requirements within their spheres of influence during the years 1946 to 1950 inclusive. The Health Departments arein process of obtaining a considerable amount of detailed information as to theactual housing plans of local authorities and particulars of private enterprisehousing projects, and when this information is available it will be practicable toprepare a more detailed and accurate phased traditional and permanent pre-fabricated housing programme and from this to re-calculate the requirements in materials and components. As similar information becomes available fromother Government Departments, similar calculations will be made and the resultssubstituted for the present estimates.5. The estimated requirements are being discussed with the building materials producers, who are studying them in the light of their knowledge of pre-war production and existing capacity in the building materials field. In sofar as the requirements are of interest to the Board of Trade, who are responsiblefor timber supply, and to other Government Departments, e.g., the Ministry ofWar Transport, they will be kept informed.Supply.6. A comparison has been made of the estimated requirements of building materials for which the Ministry of Works is the production authority with the capacity of the industries concerned, where known, and also with present actualproduction.   At the present time there are serious shortages in (i) Asbestos cement,(ii) Slates.(iii) Plasterboard.(iv) Plate Glass.(i) The shortage in asbestos cement is mainly due to the abnormal demands made on this commodity by the temporary house programme.   Asbestos cement
is one of the few satisfactory substitutes for brick, concrete or stone in the outercladding of a building. Although the production of asbestos cement productsnow exceeds the pre-war level, it has been necessary for me to arrange forthree-quarters of the whole product of the industry to be supplied to temporaryhouse manufacturers. While this is barely sufficient for their needs, it leaves aserious shortage for all other users. As soon as the temporary house demandfalls off, it will be possible correspondingly to increase supplies for other purposes,and the period of serious stringency will not last beyond the autumn of 1946. Ifadequate labour can be supplied to, and retained in, the asbestos cement industry,it should be possible to meet absolutely essential needs.(ii) The roofing slates industry is a very old one which has been steadilydeclining over a long period of years; it has failed to meet the competition oftiles in the roofing field. The present extreme shortage is very largely due to thewidespread war damage to slate-roofed buildings. A roof made with slates canonly be repaired with the same material, or entirely re-roofed. The war damagerepair demand greatly exceeds the supply, and there is no prospect of expanding the supply in any reasonable time so as to meet this exceptional demand. It willbe necessary to cater for roofing requirements by the production of other materials,e.g., clay tiles, and no major difficulty is anticipated so far as new buildings areconcerned. Where necessary war-damaged buildings can, at increased expenseof labour, be re-roofed with tiles. The slate industry is concentrated in threeareas Westmorland, Cornwall and, the biggest of all, North Wales. It isunfortunately the case that if the Welsh slate industry disappears there are no alternative industries ready to take its place and to absorb the existing labour force. It would also be regrettable from the architectural point of view if slateswere not available as a roofing medium. The slate industry has changed itsmethods little, if at all, during the last 50 years and still relies very largely onthe skill of the craftsman and not on mechanical appliances. I am consideringthe appointment of an independent committee to advise upon the future of this industry.(iii) The plasterboard industry is one which grew apace in the immediatepre-war years, at a time when plasterboard was coming increasingly into use asa material for the internal lining of houses, e.g., ceilings, in place of the olderlath and plaster. Present demands are abnormally increased by reason of war damage and the exceptional needs for this material in the construction of temporary houses. It seems probable that the demand for this material for theinternal lining, not only of prefabricated, but also of traditional houses, will tendyet further to increase. A special survey has been made of production capacity,stocks and requirements and discussions will take place with the industryimmediately as to the steps necessary to ensure that future production is adequate to meet probable needs.(iv) Demands for plate glass are exceptional owing to war damage.Additional capacity is now coming into production, and it will be possible in thenear future to increase the supplies available for the repair of war damage and forsuch new construction as calls for the use of this particular material. It isfortunate that it is not required in the housing programme.7. Arrangements are in hand to secure prompter and more adequate statis-tical information regarding building materials production, distribution and stocks. Defence Regulations provide adequate powers to secure this information,and discussions are proceeding with representatives of the building materialsproducers as to the forms of returns which will be used. Where necessary, lettersof direction will be served on individual producers requiring them to give theinformation required. The producers and distributors are well-known and ithas not, therefore, been necessary to make a Statutory Order requiring themto be registered.8. The very large labour recruitment necessary to enable the building materials industries to work at full capacity has been brought to the notice ofMinisters on several occasions, and almost all materials may be in dangerouslyshort supply from time to time unless the labour force in those industries canbe satisfactorily increased. In a number of them the working conditions areunattractive. They are dirty industries in which much work is performed inthe open without adequate shelter from the weather, and they perhaps lackamenities which are customary in industries such as engineering, which were greatly expanded during the war. The Ministry of Labour are examining wageslevels and working conditions in the industries, and I propose to arrange for[31178] g
special enquiries to be made into certain of them by representatives of theindustries with independent persons added, with a view to the extension of measures that will make them more attractive to labour and more efficient. Iam making an immediate start with the brick industry.9. The serious shortage of timber supplies for all purposes is a matter ofcommon knowledge. It falls within the responsibility of the Board of Trade,and it must rest with the President to provide estimates of the amount of timberthat can be made available in future for housing and other building purposes.Distribution.10. Before the war the builders&apos; merchants successfully operated as themachinery of distribution of building materials and components for the building and civil engineering industry, and there is no obvious reason to suppose thatthey cannot continue in this capacity in the future. It would be difficult, if not entirely impracticable, to set up a Government machine to distribute all building and civil engineering materials and components. The principal matters requiringattention are first, to ensure that housing and other priority building jobs receivematerials in preference to non-priority jobs, and secondly, that stock accumula-tions are not allowed to exist in particular areas at a time when there is scarcity of the same materials in other areas.11. Machinery already exists for allocating &quot; A &quot; Priority to housing andto a proportion of other building work, and arrangements are being worked out tosecure that jobs given &quot; A &quot; Priority for labour purposes shall also be given thesome priority in the supply of scarce materials. It will be necessary for Govern-ment Departments acting as production authorities to schedule materials and components in short supply. Building contractors employed on &quot;A&quot; Priorityjobs requiring scheduled materials would then be given priority dockets giving them preference in the supply of the scheduled scarce materials. It is not antici-pated that there will be any difficulty in making arrangements with the building materials producers and the builders5 merchants to operate such a priority scheme on a voluntary basis; if, in fact, difficulties do arise the Defence Regulationscontain ample powers to enable the appropriate Ministers to give the necessarydirections as to the distribution of the scarce materials. The working out of detailed arrangements and negotiations with industry are in process.12. The regulation of stocks in the hands of builders&apos; merchants so as toavoid unequal distribution could also probably best be undertaken by thedistributors on a voluntary basis. I am consulting with the builders&apos; merchantsas to the best means to adopt.Storage.13. It may happen that, as a result of Government blanket orders, produc-tion of certain articles will, from time to time, exceed immediate demands, and thefacilities available in the temporary house distribution centres can then be usedfor storage of surplus materials and components which cannot be accommodated within the industry&apos;s own capacity. The discussions with the builders&apos; merchantswill cover the extent of the existing storage facilities already available to industry.Bulk Purchase.14. I have not so far made any specific contracts for bulk purchase or pro-duction agreements, but I am considering the desirability of making productionagreements for certain standard articles of builders&apos; joinery internal doors,kitchen and bathroom cupboards. The Minister of Supply is circulating a separatenote on the items with which he is concerned.G. T.Ministry of Works,7th January, 1946.
ANNEX J.Housing Components and Fitments.memorandum by the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production.1 Under a directive issued by the Prime Minister on the 20th September,1945 (C.P.(45)185), the responsibility for the production of a large number of housing components and fitments was transferred from the Board of Trade to theMinistry of Supply. The transfer of this responsibility necessitated the settingup, within the Ministry of Supply, of a new Division which was brought into being early in October.2. At that time no schedule of requirements was available and definiteplanning of production was not therefore possible; but an estimate of requirementswas compiled by the Ministry and target figures for production worked out.The industries concerned were encouraged to produce at the maximum possiblerate as it was realised that there existed shortages of supplies. A programme of requirements has now been drawn up by the Ministry of Works and it is estimatedthat, with the exceptions referred to in paragraph 7 below, the production capacityavailable throughout 1946 will exceed the stated requirements. It should be pointed out that this excess of production over requirements is essential in orderto refill the distribution pipe-line; but, in the meantime, the requirements for housing and repair of bomb damage can only be met fairly if a method of identified-fying the relevant orders throughout the distributive chain is adopted.3. Discussions have taken place with Trade Associations and their co-operation in meeting the demands for housing and other building purposesgenerally has been secured. The Associations have also been informed of thedecision to place orders for housing components with the Royal OrdnanceFactories.4. The Trade, through their respective Associations, have been notified thatblanket (or underwriting) orders, in the form of production agreements, will beplaced for a number of stores, and have been asked to notify the Department ofthe quota which each of the firms within the particular industry can undertaketo supply during 1946. A proportion of the total requirement has been reservedfor manufacturers not members of the Trade Associations. The placing ofblanket orders will be extended over a large field of components.5. It will be realised that by placing blanket orders production is securedat the required rate; the range of articles to be manufactured is confined to a fewtypes and sizes, and manufacturers&apos; prices are controlled.6. Use is being made of the productive capacity of the Royal OrdnanceFactories to meet emergency requirements. Some orders have already been placedand it is expected that further orders will be placed in the very near future for alimited range of items.7. There are two classes of product which present special difficulty, namely,light castings and ceramic refractories (the latter being components of electricalfittings). In the case of the former, action is being taken to increase the outputby encouraging mechanization of foundries, and the use of pressed steel and other alternative materials is under active consideration. In the case of the latter, an advisory Committee has been set up, by which medium it is expected that the out-put of the industry will be increased. In order to assist in the supply of labour to these two industries, a Labour Supply Committee for Building Materials and components has been set up by the Ministry of Labour.8. Figures showing the output of the principal components during the last three months, together with a forecast of production capacity and requirements in 1946, are included in Table E appended to the Progress Report on Housing :December 1945. The forecasts are based on the assumption that during the year there will be a flow of labour into each of the industries at a reasonable rate. From,this statement it will be observed that, with few exceptions, the requirementstogether with a substantial distribution pipe-line will be met during 1946.J.
