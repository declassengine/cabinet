THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1946.TOP secret copy No.CP. (46) 48.lSth January, 1946.CABINET.POLISH ARMED FORCES UNDER BRITISH COMMAND.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WE have examined the memorandum* by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs concerning the future of the Polish armed forces.2. The steps the Foreign Secretary proposes to take raise the followingmilitary questions : -Treatment of Poles who refuse to return to Poland.3. We agree that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement should hold out a verydiscouraging alternative to return to Poland. On the other hand, we considerit most important that the former Prime Ministers pledge to- those who have fought for us should be honoured. All the Services owe. much to the Poles. Polishships formed an integral part of the British Fleet. The Polish Corps in Italyunder General Anders was a substantal reinforcement to the Allied Armies inthat theatre; it fought gallantly and at the cost of heavy casualties; without itthe series of offensives carried out from Cassino onwards would hardly have beenpossible. The Polish Air Force also has made by far the greatest air contribution of all our European Allies. They have formed part and parcel of all R.A.F.operational commands and fought with us throughout the war, including taking a prominent part in the Battle of Britain.We suggest, therefore, that although our policy of encouraging the maximumnumbers to return necessitates our being as discouraging as honesty allowsregarding the prospects of those who refuse to do so, we must in the end ensurethe best possible terms for those who do refuse and who fought for us during muchof the war.Treatment of General Anders.4. We are impressed by the unanimity of opinion concerning the personalinfluence of General Anders over his troops; also regarding the need for hisco-operation, or at least his abstention from opposition, if we are to ensure thereturn of any reasonable number of Poles to Poland. It is therefore right that every effort should be made to secure his co-operation by summoning him, throughthe agency of the Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean, to London for consultation with the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister.(a) Treatment of Poles who refuse to return to Poland.(&amp;) Treatment of General Anders.(c) Certain other points of military importance.[31182]* CP.

5. We consider, however, that there is only a slender chance of success inthis approach and that, failing success, it would be most undesirable thatGeneral Anders should be allowed to return to his Corps in Italy. Should wehave to keep General Anders away from his Corps, it will be desirable to avoid any formal dismissal or publicity at the time we were trying to press the Polesto return, since this might both have an adverse effect on our efforts and precipitatea mutiny which it would not be possible to control owing to lack of the necessaryforces.Other Points of Military Importance.6. Disarmament. There is no point in disarming the Poles before theannouncement on the proposed policy is made. With reference to paragraph 14of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum, the timing of disarmament of the Poleswho decline to return to Poland will need careful consideration, and priorappreciation by General Morgan, in the light of the numbers remaining, theirattitude, and the situation which may then exist concerning General Anders. Itmay well prove to be the best answer to allow them to remain in possession oftheir personal arms pending demobilisation.7. Movement. It is not practicable to examine in detail the movement ofthe Poles who go back to Poland until we have a clearer indication of the numbers involved.8. Equipment. We consider that the general question of equipment willalso have to be decided later, but there is one aspect to this problem to which wewould draw attention. The policy proposed-by the Foreign Secretary is to waittill we see how many Poles volunteer to return, before we commit ourselves to hand over any equipment. The Admiralty, however, have agreed with the ForeignOffice that two Polish naval officers should visit London to discuss the future ofthe Polish Navy and its ships.The Admiralty are considering a policy of returning the ships owned by-Poland and of loaning, on easy terms, those others now manned by Poles, on condition that the majority of the Polish Navy personnel returns in these ships.(Signed) ALANBROOKE.ARTHUR TEDDER.R.
