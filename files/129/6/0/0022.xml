secret. Copy No.CP. (46) 22.242 A January, 1946. :iCABINET.NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE, THANKSGIVING ANDDEDICATION IN COMMEMORATION OF THE FALLEN IN THEWARS OF 1914-18 AND 1939-45.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. At a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 13th September last (CM. (45)31st Conclusions, Minute 2), I was invited, in consultation with the interests concerned, to consider further the selection of a date on which a National Dayof Remembrance for both wars could be celebrated.2. I have accordingly held two meetings, at which representatives of the churches in England and Scotland, of the British Legion and of the Departmentsconcerned were present. In reporting the sentiments held by those representingthe Churches and the British Legion, I think I cannot do better than reproducethe following extract from a letter which was addressed to me by the Bishopof Winchester following the first meeting : &apos;&apos; On further reflection and in the light of experience, we must (it seemsto us) recognise the following facts : &apos;(1) Unfortunately, the last war has not yielded any one day or season,the commemoration of which would be generally felt to have anysignificance or ground of appeal comparable to that whichRemembrance Sunday in November has actually acquired.(2) Remembrance Sunday has already been generally and movinglyobserved in 1945, since the conclusion of the last war andevidently had no less strong appeal this year to those who foughtand were bereaved in the war 1939-45, than to those who foughtand were bereaved in the war of 1914-18, and(3) those who grew up during the period 1918-39 have come to associatethis season in November with national remembrance andthanksgiving.And we are, therefore, unanimously and strongly of opinion:  (a) That National Remembrance, Thanksgiving and Dedication, should in future be concentrated on a Sunday :(b) That this Sunday should be the Sunday before the 11th November(unless the 11th November or the 12th November is a Sunday)and that it still be known as Remembrance Sunday:(c) That the Cenotaph ceremony and Two Minutes&apos; Silence at 11 o&apos;clockshould be always observed on this Sunday.The representatives of the Churches and the British Legion do not exclude the possibility that after some years have passed change of opinionor circumstance might make it easier to transfer Remembrance Day to aSunday or week-day at a more congenial time of year. But, not withoutregret, they are satisfied that to transfer Remembrance Sunday from Novembernow would be a false step and would pretty certainly entail spiritual lossrather than gain to the peoples of Britain and the Empire.&quot;At the second meeting of the Conference, held after the receipt of this letter,the views expressed in it were elaborated with feeling and conviction.   The[31207]1www.i] b.c 3ls.fiqoiqq.ft sod v;d tow       add smiub US! oow    i - - tinjf? l &apos; totu*sm.e ;dPrinted for tfie Cabinet.   January 1946.
representatives of the Churches and the British Legion suggested that theCenotaph, which is inscribed in memory of the dead in the war of 1914-18, shouldbe associated with those who fell during the late war by the appropriate additionto the dates on the stone. &apos;\ -X3.   The observations of the Departments were as follows : The Foreign Office pointed out that, in the United States of America,Armistice Day (11th November) is a statutory holiday, and it is considered thatthe United States Government would desire to maintain it. Legislation in theUnited States would be required if it were desired to decide upon some otherday of the year.The Colonial Office, after consulting a number of Colonial Governments,considered that it would be extremely difficult to find a date other than the11th November which would not be open to objection in some Colony or Colonies,for example, by clashing with religious festivals.The India Office pointed out that from May to August the climate in india is unsuitable for ceremonies; and the seat of Government is then in the Hills.The 11th November is preferred by the Government of India.Of the Service Departments, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry.offered noobservations; the War Office would prefer the date to remain the 11th November.4. It will be seen that the consensus of opinion is overwhelmingly in favourof associating the future Day of Remembrance with the day now celebrated in&quot;commemoration of those who fell in the 1914-19 war. The acceptance of this opinion would have the advantage that the season of commemoration in thiscountry will be the same as that now observed in the United States of America,the desirability of which was pointed out at the Cabinet Meeting of the.15th September last.i-&apos;&quot; 5. I therefore propose, if my colleagues agree, to submit for His Majesty&apos;$pleasure that the Sunday before the 11th November, unless the 11th or&apos;12 A November be a Sunday, shall be known as Remembrance Sunday, shall be observed as a National Day of Remembrance for the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45and shall be associated with the National observance at the Cenotaph at 11 1a.m.and the Tivo Minutes&apos; Silence.J. C. E.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,24th January, 1946.
