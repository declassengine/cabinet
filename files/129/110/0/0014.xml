(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)9th July, 1962CABINETRESALE PRICE maintenance memorandum by the.2^QZ^^ ^l^ ^^i^^S^^2^S lk.and j^4-k*Lls^J-?.-tPjL JL9A^5cjj.This note comments on the memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade on resale price maintenance (C. (62) 112).2. The abolition of resale price maintenance raises important political and economic issues.     This paper is concerned only with themore technical legal issues involved in the question whether to make a contract containing a resale price maintenance clause illegal or simplyunenforceable.     I should not like to be thought to have prejudged theother issues, upon which I have great doubts.3. The President&apos;s proposal involves adding a new crime to the calendar.     I find the prospect of putting a manufacturer and a smallshopkeeper in a criminal dock for entering into a resale price maintenance agreement unattractive to the point of being abhorrent andridiculous.     To misquote Occam:   crimina non sunt multiplicandapraeter necessj.tetem.     We undermine the whole basis of criminal law if we make it depart too far from morality and commonsense.4. Far more serious however would be the effect on contractlaw.    A contract of sale containing a resale price maintenance clausewould be illegal and not simply unenforceable.     The effect would be toinvalidate it in toto.    I do not think the courts would sever the resale price maintenance clause from the rest of the contract.5. The result of this would be that a dishonest retailer could takegoods under such a contract without paying for them.    Having practisedat the Bar under the intolerable situation which obtained under theSocialist building regulations, I for one am simply not prepared toaccept the demoralising effect on commercial morality which would follow.6. It is true that this might be avoided to some extent byinserting in any bill a clause declaring a resale price maintenanceclause severable, and thus avoiding the ordinary results of the law of contract.     But I doubt if this would be satisfactory.    Supposing itwere not really severable ?    And why mutilate the law of contract?-1-COPY NO.   b(
7. If for economic reasons the Cabinet decided that resale price maintenance was undesirable the only acceptable way to deal with theproblem would be to declare a resale price maintenance clauseunenforceable.     It might then be legitimate to make it a crime to seek to enforce such a clause by withdrawing a franchise.     The latter stepcould just be justified, since the proposed offence would involve a deliberate attempt to defeat the policy of the law by something likeforce.HAILS HAMOffice of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science, S. W. 1.9th July, 1962.
