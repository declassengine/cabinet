Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 144 Copy No.    62nd October, 1962CABINETFUTURE OF MESSRS. SHORT BROTHERS AND HARLANDMemorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Minister ofAviationProblemUrgent decisions are required about the future of Messrs. Shorts, which is ina critical situation owing to insufficient orders for the Belfast freighter. TheCompany is of special importance to the economy of Northern Ireland, and itsproblems are such that only the Government can resolve them, for the reasonsthat:(a) The firm is largely dependent on Government orders.(b) 70 per cent, of the firm&apos;s share capital is Government owned.2. When the aircraft industry was reorganised in 1959 and early 1960, it didnot prove possible to associate Messrs. Shorts with either of the two major airframegroups on which, if the industry is to become economically viable, future government orders must be concentrated. At the present time Messrs. Shorts mustbe regarded as unsaleable. The only way of associating the Company with oneof the major groups in the foreseeable future would probably be by renting the assets on special terms.3. The Company is running out of work, and, unless it receives further orders and financial help soon, will not be able to carry on. Civil orders for the Belfastfreighter aircraft have as yet failed to materialise. Every effort has been made todiversify the firm&apos;s activities, and production of a variety of products has been undertaken. It is clear, however, that this will not provide a solution to the firm&apos;sproblems, and that over the next few years the firm will be dependent on furtheraircraft work which can probably come only from Government sources.4. In view of the shortage of work in the major aircraft groups themselves,Messrs. Shorts is unlikely to survive unless special measures of protection are authorised, which must detract from the long-term prospects of viability of theindustry as a whole.Background5. A detailed statement of the firm&apos;s activities is set out in the attachedAnnex A.Political Considerations6. For many years unemployment in Northern Ireland has remained at a level of between 7 and 10 per cent, despite the exceptional measures which havebeen taken in an attempt to reduce it. Last year a joint Working Party of officials of United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Departments with an outside Chairman1453a
was set up to examine the factors causing the persistent problem of high unemployment and the measures that might be taken to bring about a lastingimprovement. When the Report of the Working Party was considered at ameeting of United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Ministers on 18th July, 1962,the latter expressed their disappointment that, although it contains minorrecommendations for extending and making better use of the existing aids to industry, it recommends no new measures of Government aid likely to make asubstantial impression on the unemployment problem. In particular the Reportrevealed that there was no agreement on a proposal, to which the Northern ireland government attach the greatest importance, for a subsidy of 10s. a week in respectof all employees in productive industry.7. Northern Ireland Ministers have continued to press for this subsidy andhave represented that if the Report is published without an indication that the twoGovernments have agreed to this or to some other measure of substantial aid to industry they will be placed in a position of acute embarrassment. There is pressure for publication of the report; it will have to be published by the time that theNorthern Ireland Parliament reassembles on 23rd October, and a statement ofGovernment policy will have to be made at the same time. A further joint meetingof Ministers has been provisionally fixed for 15th October to resume discussion ofthe Report, fix a date for its publication and consider the terms of the government statement.8. In recent months public anxiety and agitation about the continued high rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland has been directed particularly to thequestion of the future of Messrs. Shorts. The firm&apos;s labour force consists of ,000 of which 1,000 are design staff, and represents some 15 per cent, of allemployed engineering industry in Northern Ireland. The Northern ireland government, the political parties, employers and trade unions have all stressed the importance to the Northern Ireland economy of maintaining the labour force at its present level and of keeping the design staff intact. It has been pointed outthat United Kingdom Ministers have given certain assurances. The parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Aviation said in the House of Commons on22nd May, 1958, &quot; I assure the hon. Members that all practical steps will betaken in an endeavour to maintain the firm as a fully balanced aircraft design and production unit&quot; [Hansard, Column 1631). On 17th December, 1961, inspeaking to representatives of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions, the Minister of Aviation said that his own view was that the Governmentshould aim to keep Messrs. Shorts as a balanced unit of the aircraft industry inNorthern Ireland.9. A statement on the future of the firm will have to be included in theGovernment^ statement of policy made when the Report of the Working party is published. If it is announced that no new version of the Belfast is to be ordered,and that there is no prospect of keeping the design team together or of maintaining the labour force at its present level, there is no doubt that both the Northern ireland government and Northern Ireland opinion will receive the news with dismay andresentment. The Working Party assumed in making their forward estimates ofemployment in Northern Ireland a limited but not a critical fall in employment inMessrs. Shorts. If this estimate proves to have been too optimistic NorthernIreland Ministers may be expected to press even more strongly for an employmentsubsidy or for some other new form of Government aid to industry.10. The financial position of the firm is grave. The immediate cause of itstroubles lies in the failure to secure sufficient orders for the Belfast. The project was launched in the expectation that some 30 aircraft would be sold, including20 to civil customers, and that this would enable the Company to break even on itsinvestment. The price for the military Belfasts was fixed on this basis. If, as now seems likely, no more than the 10 aircraft at present on order for the RoyalAir Force are sold, it is estimated that the Company will incur a loss of  15 million,a sum far in excess of the value of its assets. In these circumstances the directorshave indicated that they will need to cease trading very soon unless the Governmenttake steps to ensure that creditors&apos; claims will be paid. The Northern ireland government have agreed to guarantee a loan of  5 million, but this will not besufficient to enable the firm to complete the current Belfast order. Thus, theCompany has an immediate cash problem,,quite apart from considerations of its long-term viability.
Beverley/Hastings Replacement Aircraft11. The tactical transport force consists of Beverley, Hastings and Argosyaircraft. Of these the Hastings will have to be replaced on grounds of age in thelate 1960s and the Beverley in the early 1970s. The Air Staff requirement (OR-351,which is still under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff) has the followingcharacteristics:(a) A radius of action of 1,250 nautical miles and a ferry range of some 5,000nautical miles.(b) A high speed.(c) A capability to land and take off in less than 1,500 ft.(d) A payload of some 35,000 lb. (the weight of the heaviest single piece of equipment to be carried) and a fuselage size adequate for its carriage,i.e., 10 ft x 10 ft.(e) Adequate   development   potential   as   regards   speed,   payload   andaerodynamic qualities to enable it to satisfy likely military needs,including a vertical take-off and landing capability, until the end of itslife.12. This requirement could not be satisfied by the purchase of additionalBelfasts of the current type from Messrs. Short and Harland. Moreover, so faras the defence budget is concerned, there is no provision in the long-term costingfor the purchase of aircraft in this category before 1969-70. Studies have beenmade of several possible aircraft which could meet the requirement. It is clearthat to develop and produce such an aircraft entirely on our own would be an extremely expensive proposition and there would seem to be little prospect of export sales. Efforts are therefore being made to find less expensive ways of meeting it, in particular by splitting the development costs of the aircraft with theUnited States. In the course of recent Ministerial discussions in Washingtonarrangements were made for staff talks to be held with the Americans in the nearfuture with the object of reaching agreement, if possible, on a joint requirement.A report on these talks is due to be made by 1st December. In these circumstances there is no prospect of our reaching a firm decision about the defence requirementmuch before Christmas.13. A note of the main alternative proposals which have so far beenconsidered for meeting the defence requirement, with comments on each, is given at Annex B. Messrs. Short and Harland could be concerned in the work in either of two possible eventualities:(a) The adoption of the Short SC-5/21B which is based on the Belfast.  Some,but not all, of the development and production work would then bedone in Northern Ireland. From the military point of view, this wouldbe the least acceptable of the various solutions considered. Thoughthe research and development costs would be less than for the AW-681,for instance, the production costs would be higher. The resultingaircraft would be too slow, too expensive and lacking in developmentpotential. (This last factor is particularly important in the case ofan aircraft which should have an operational life lasting well into the1980s.) The slow speed would probably make a larger productionorder necessary, thus increasing the burden on the defence budget.There is no possibility of persuading the Americans to share the cost of developing such an aircraft.(b) The adoption of one of the alternative solutions, with some of the productionwork sub-contracted to Messrs. Shorts. Such an arrangement would be practicable if any solution other than the purchase of complete airframesfrom abroad was adopted. Sub-contracting in this way would undoubtedly be costly and it is open to serious question whether the extra cost should be borne by the defence budget.Industrial Considerations Affecting Future of Messrs. Shorts14. The problem of Messrs. Shorts must be considered in relation to that ofthe aircraft industry as a whole. The future programme of military requirements is unlikely to provide enough support to maintain the major groups in the industry at an adequate level.   So far as design is concerned, even if all the unapproved
items in the forward programme, military and civil, including OR-351 and thesupersonic transport, are approved and shared between the major groups, there will still have to be a substantial reduction in their design strengths by 1965. In thesecircumstances, it is difficult to contemplate placing any design work on OR-351which may be undertaken in this country outside one of the major groups. the design team at Messrs. Shorts is too small, too inexperienced, and cannot be compared with the design resources of the two major groups. Similarly, there isnot enough production work to employ fully the resources of the main groups and provide adequate support for their civil activities, though this is not so critical asthe situation on the design side; moreover, production costs in Northern Irelandtend to be higher than in Britain.15. On the other hand, if Messrs. Shorts was unable to complete its existing contracts, e.g., for the 10 Belfast freighters and the Seacat missiles, this would be most embarrassing to the Government from all points of view. There are no alternative ways of meeting these military requirements without serious delay.16. In these circumstances, the Minister of Aviation as executive administratorof Messrs. Shorts, and viewing the problem from the defence and industrialstandpoints, is forced to the following conclusions:(a) It will not be possible to maintain Messrs. Shorts as a balanced unitdesigning and manufacturing aircraft and guided weapons on its own.Whatever solution is adopted for Beverley/Hastings replacement (andMessrs. Shorts&apos; own proposals based on further deevlopment of the belfast are opposed by the Air Staff), it would be mistaken to give the design work on this or any other major project to Messrs. Shorts, in viewof the fact that the design strengths of the main groups in the industry are already being cut down.(b) Production requirements are not likely to be large enough in future to justifygiving Messrs. Shorts orders for complete aircraft designed by the majorgroups.(c) Production sub-contracts could be given to Messrs. Shorts though not without some increase in cost. There would also be the effect of the resulting under-employment of the capacity of the main groups in theUnited Kingdom. Northern Ireland costs tend to be higher than onthe mainland, and there are additional costs of transport, jigging andtooling, and education involved in divided production. Production isbeing divided in the case of the follow-on order for VC-lOs and similar arrangements could be made whatever solution (other than purchasefrom abroad) is adopted for OR-351. Such a policy would, however,conflict with the long-term interests of the aircraft industry in thatany increase in the cost of its products would hamper its efforts in the highly competitive civil and export markets.Basic Decisions Needed17.   In this situation we must ask the Cabinet to make a choice now between:(a) A decision that Messrs. Shorts can no longer be maintained as part ofthe aircraft industry after its existing obligations have been fulfilled.(b) Authorising measures which will enable Messrs. Shorts not only tocomplete their existing contracts but to continue in operation at anyrate for some years though at a lower level of activity through a deliberate policy of allocating production work by sub-contract fromthe major groups.18. It could well be argued that from the angle of aircraft and defence policy the alternative in paragraph 17 (a) above is to be preferred. In either event meansmust be found of immediately dealing with the financial problem described earlier in the paper. Unless special measures are taken the firm may be forced into liquidation very soon.19. The additional finance required by Messrs. Shorts to complete the tenBelfast freighters and the present Seacat programme is of the order of  10 million over the next three years, including the  5 million which the Government ofNorthern Ireland have already agreed to advance. The arrangements for providingthis additional money are being discussed with the Treasury.
CONFroENTIAL5Recommendations20.   We invite the Cabinet to agree that:(i) Appropriate financial measures should be taken by the Governmentto enable Messrs. Shorts to fulfil its existing obligations.(ii) In the context of a shrinking military programme, it would not be economicto maintain Messrs Shorts&apos; capacity; if, however, it is consideredjustified on social and political grounds, some additional productionsub-contract work, e.g., on the Beverley/Hastings replacement, could continue to be placed with Messrs. Shorts with a view to providing employment. It is not possible to estimate in advance how muchemployment could be provided by this means but there would probably have to be a substantial reduction in the total numbers at presentemployed by the firm. It would be for consideration whether the extra cost should be borne on or outside the defence budget. No allowance for such extra costs has been made in the defence forward costings.(iii) In any event, no new design work for Government aircraft or guided weapons requirements should be placed with Messrs. Shorts, who should accordingly make plans for the run-down of its design team.(iv) The Ministry of Aviation should continue to explore the possibility, inthe longer term, of some form of association between Messrs. Snortsand one of the major airframe groups.(v) There should be a public announcement of the Governments policy towards the Company, to be drafted in the light of Ministers&apos; decisions.P. T.J. A.2nd October, 1962.
Annex AORGANISATION AND ACTIVITIES OF MESSRS. SHORTSThe firm has a modern factory of about 2 million square feet at Belfast anda number of small outlying works. The Company is 70 per cent, owned by her majesty&apos;s Government, the remaining 30 per cent, shareholding being dividedequally between Messrs. Harland and Wolff and Bristol Aircraft Ltd. The total labour force is about 7,000 people, including 1,000 design staff, and represents some15 per cent, of all the employed engineering industry in Northern Ireland.2. On the military aircraft side, 10 Belfast freighters have been ordered forthe Royal Air Force at a total cost of about  26 million. In addition,Messrs. Shorts has Government contracts covering a programme of research flyingon the SC-1 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft and the supply of sparesand modification work on Royal Air Force Canberras and Britannias; and, as recently announced, some production work on VC-10 aircraft for the Royal AirForce is to be sub-contracted to Messrs. Shorts by the British Aircraft Corporation.As a commercial venture, the Company is proposing to develop the Skyvan lightfreighter of which the piston-engined prototype is expected to fly towards the endof 1962. No orders have yet been obtained for this aircraft. Messrs. Shorts&apos;interest in the guided weapon field is confined to work on the Seacat naval guidedmissile and an improved Seacat system with a blind fire capability. Some 2,200Seacat missiles and spares have been ordered for the Royal Navy at a total costof about  9 million, and 370 (so far) by oversea customers.3. As regards future work, there are a number of possibilities but few of themoffer any real promise. On the civil side, the employment resulting from theSkyvan project, if it goes ahead, would be relatively modest. The British OverseasAircraft Corporation has expressed some interest in a civil version of the Belfast(with more powerful Rolls-Royce Tyne engines) but is not likely to want more thana couple of aircraft in the foreseeable future, which is not in itself a sufficientrequirement to justify the additional cost of development. Another possibilitywhich Messrs. Shorts is exploring is a joint venture with Pressed Steel Ltd. to manufacture Beagle light aircraft at Belfast. Pressed Steel suggested that a subsidiary Company be formed for this purpose to which Pressed Steel should contribute 40 per cent, and Messrs. Shorts 60 per cent, of the capital. In thepresent circumstances of Messrs. Shorts, however, it would seem unwise to increasethe Governments investment to enable the firm to take a share in the speculativeBeagle venture.4. It seems most unlikely that any further orders, civil or military, will beobtained for the current version of the Belfast. With a view to exploiting itsexperience on the SC-1 VTOL research project, the firm have entered into agreements with aircraft manufacturers overseas to collaborate in designssubmitted to meet current requirements of the North Atlantic Alliance for a tactical strike/reconnaissance VTOL aircraft and a VTOL transport aircraft, butthere appears little probability of any substantial amount of work resulting fromthese agreements. The Company is also exploring the possibilities of making itsfacilities available to American Companies (e.g., Lockheed) which might be interested in acquiring production capacity in Europe. In the guided weaponsfield, an order for 3,000 additional Seacat missiles for the Royal Navy is expected,and considerable further orders from overseas are also expected. In addition,the Company has recently submitted proposals for an improved version of Seacatand is developing as a private venture a land variant of Seacat known as Tigercat,but there is no current United Kingdom requirement for either an improvedversion or variant of Seacat.5. The most important new project on which the Company has pinned itshopes is OR-351. Derivatives of the Belfast are among the submissions beingconsidered for the Beverley / Hastings replacement aircraft. If these are rejectedMessrs. Shorts would still hope to participate as sub-contractors in any production programme.
6. The prospects for the Company&apos;s labour force are that, in the absenceof fresh orders, some 400 design staff will be redundant by the end of this year, and1,600 other employees by about Autumn, 1963. Allowing for the expectedadditional Seacat orders and for sub-contract work on VC-10 aircraft for theRoyal Air Force, the Companys labour force could probably stabilise at about this level (i.e., 5,000) until 1965. There will not be enough work to employ theguided weapons design team after 1963-64 when development of the Seacat willhave been completed.October, 1962.Annex BALTERNATIVE METHODS OF MEETING THE DEFENCEREQUIREMENT FOR A MEDIUM RANGE TACTICAL TRANSPORTAIRCRAFTThe following are the main alternatives which have been considered for meeting the requirement for a Beverley/Hastings replacement:(a) The AW-681, a Whitworth Gloster project for a 4-engined jet aircraftdesigned to meet the operational requirement in full with first deliveries in 1969-70. This is technically the best solution. The latest calculation of the Air Ministry is that about 60 of these aircraft would be neededat an estimated gross cost of  160 million.(b) The Short SC-5/21B.  This is a turboprop aircraft based on the Belfast,100 knots slower than the AW-681 but available a year or so earlier.Though the research and development costs would be less, theproduction costs would be greater. The estimated gross cost for 60aircraft is  175 million, but in practice more aircraft would be neededthan with the AW-681 because the SC-5/21B is slower, and the discrepancy in cost would therefore be greater still. On the otherhand if this solution were adopted the prospective loss of  15 million on the Belfast order would not arise and the Exchequer would be relieved of the liability which it would otherwise incur for the greaterpart of this sum.(c) A new aircraft to a joint requirement with the Americans.   present indications are that the Americans may require an aircraft in one or both of the two following categories:(i) An interim transport for delivery as early as 1963-64. This wouldhave to be an adaptation of an existing aircraft and is likely totake the form of a version of the Lockheed Hercules C-130.From our point of view the limited hold size would mean thatsome equipment required for limited war, such as Thunderbird II,could not be carried. As a fall-back position, however, thiswould be acceptable to the War Office. A few more aircraft might be needed owing to rather lower speed. This solution would have the great advantage of being available in the mid-1960s. Financially, however, it might be difficult to findmoney for it since there is no provision in the long-term costingbefore 1969-70.(ii) A more advanced aircraft for initial delivery in 1968-69. There isno firm American operational requirement for this aircraft andthe current United States Air Force conception differs widelyfrom our OR-351. There are some grounds for believing,however, that the staff talks may result in agreement on aconception which is a good deal closer to ours.October 1962.
