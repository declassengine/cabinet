Printed for the Cabinet. July 1962C. (62) 127 Copy No.   5 827th July, 1962CABINETCOVENT GARDEN MARKETMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodThis paper is to inform my colleagues of the latest position on the siting ofthe new Covent Garden Market.2. During the passage of the Covent Garden Market Bill last session therewas dispute about the best site. We accepted the recommendation of LordRunciman&apos;s Committee on horticultural marketing that the Market should stay in the Covent Garden area but realised that another site might be found lateroutside it.3. At Committee Stage in the House of Commons on 9th May, 1961, I saidthat if, after examining all aspects of the problem, and after consulting all the organisations concerned, the Authority were to reach a generally acceptableconclusion about another site, we would be prepared to consider legislation tomake this possible (Hansard, Fifth Series, Volume 640, columns 265 and 266).On 3rd July, 1961, Lord Stonham successfully moved an amendment in the Houseof Lords enabling the Minister by Special Procedure Order to designate a marketarea outside the Covent Garden area. This was not intended as a wreckingamendment but would have had this effect. So we had to consider how to save the Bill; and at Report Stage we had the Amendment deleted and the thenLord Chancellor said &quot; that in such circumstances (i.e., consultation by theAuthority and general support for their proposals), it is not the intention of theMinister to withhold his consent to the promotion of a Private Bill in parliament by the Authority, empowering it to build the Market elsewhere under Clause 20of the Bill&quot;.4. It is now virtually certain that the Authority will wish to rebuild theMarket outside the Covent Garden area. But it is far. from certain where theywill want to rebuild. They have commissioned the Fantus Company InternationalLimited to advise them on the best site. A final decision is highly unlikely beforeabout March 1963. A Private Bill specifying the site would probably have to wait until the 1963-64 session, though there would be a faint possibility of its being accepted in 1962-63 under the late Bill procedure. This I think we should wish to agree to.5. But the Authority have now asked for my consent to the introduction ofa Bill in November 1962 (before they have taken a decision on the site) to enablethem to rebuild the Market on an unspecified site which would have to be designated by me later by a Special Procedure Order. This is the quickestprocedure and, being business men, the Authority want to press ahead as fast asthey can. I sympathise with them. Any delay in getting legislative authority would be irksome and they feel they would be open to criticism.6. But there would be great embarrassment for the Government if I wereto agree to that form of procedure, because it is virtually the same as that
proposed in Lord Stonham&apos;s amendment, which we had to reverse at the report stage in the House of Lords. It is also contrary to the views we have always held-that:(i) the Act should only be amended after the Authority had decided on the site they want; and(ii) subordinate legislation is inappropriate for a subject of this importance and because private rights are affected.7. The Authority&apos;s Bill whatever its shape will be bound to be controversial because it will be reversing both our policy on Covent Garden andone of the main recommendations of the Runciman Committee. If we have to face this controversy I think we should only do so after the Market authority have decided on a site. On reasonable assumptions, the difference in timingbetween the Authority&apos;s proposal and what I think we can accept would be of theorder of six to nine months.conclusion. I propose, if my colleagues agree, to tell the Authority that I am notprepared to give my consent to a Bill which does not specify a site.C. S.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,26th July, 1962.
