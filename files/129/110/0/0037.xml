(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.M.N.(62) 55 (Revise)20th August, 1962 COPY N0oCABINETCOMMON MARKET NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEETHE EFFECT ON UNITED KINGDOM AGRICULTURE OPOUR ACCESSION TO THE EaS0C.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food.      Since the last stage of the negotiations had to concentrate on Commonwealth issues there was no further discussion ofBritish agriculture.    Although much Is accordingly stillunresolved - almost all the commodity arrangements - I thinkthat I should now give my colleagues an idea of the likelyeffect on British agriculture of our accession to the E.E.C.on the terms that seem likely to be negotiable, and of there actions we must expect from the farming community,2.      The farmers will be primarily concerned with the effects on the income of the industry of the change-over from ourpresent guaranteed prices to the Community&apos;s arrangements.Secondly, although the agreement for a system of annual reviews will be of great value to us presentationally, the farmers will &quot;be concerned, by the fact that the Communitysystem will not give them anything like the degree of assurance that they have at present.    Although the moreprogressive elements in the industry will be able to make thenecessary psychological adjustment the National Farmers&apos;Unions (N.F0U&apos;s) will make much of the uncertainty involvedin moving over to the Six&apos;s system and will present the out-look for the industry as a whole as a bleak one.Commodity arrangements3.      The position on individual commodities is likely to beas follows -fa)    For cereals, the prospects are that our cereal growers(especially of wheat) would in general stand to gain in income,and that the Six&apos;s system of target and intervention prices wouldgive a reasonable assurance to individual cereals, producers.The outlook for oats growers is not satisfactory, unless we can get the Six to agree to extend the target price system to oats.(b)    On beef our producers would have less assurance under theCommunity&apos;s arrangements than under our present guaranteed price,system;    and it is likely that they would suffer some reductionin profitability, unless we can retain our calf subsidy - andthe chances of being able to get the Six&apos;s agreement to this are very slight.-1-
(c) The outlook on J^igmeat, is bleaker then on beef.     Feeding-stuffs costs will be notably higher in the Common Market thanours at present, and. the producer price is likely to be lower than our guaranteed priceo     Moreover, if we do not get the six&apos;s agreement to our proposal that the pigmeat regulationshould be supplemented by guide or target prices and Communityintervention arrangements, our producers would have to face the uncertainty of the free market, which is notoriously difficult for pigmeat.(d) On muttou.^and lajnb we want to continue deficiency paymentsuntil market price levels in the United Kingdom give ourproducers returns broadly equivalent to the present guaranteed prices.     We must expect difficulty in getting the Six to agreeto any deficiency payments continuing into the Common Marketstage? -    but the common external tariff would not by itselfmaintain our producers&apos; position vis-a-vis producers in NewZealand and Australia..     Our producers1 prospects in. the longer term depend on the common policy that will have to be worked out.Their incomes will almost certainly be reduced if we have toabandon our agricultural support system and also provide a market for large quantities of New Zealand lamb?    they will lose in both quantity and priceo(e) For eggs    it is likely that the harmonised market price level will be at or slightly below our market price, which ismuch below the return our producers get through the guarantee -the Egg Board&apos;s selling price in 1961/62 was just over 3s. 0d*adozesa compared with . the present. guaranteed pripeof nearly, 3s^1 0d,We should have touhase Pur deficiency laayOTents Xworth^about1Od. a dozen)i and our egg producers would in addition have to absorb increased feedingstuffs costs  ( .mounting t0 5d. or 6d. a dozen).    They would therefore face a o eye-re cut m unit. returns,and their relative position at the end of the transitional period would depend on how successfully they had managed to offset theloss of the deficiency payment and the increased feedingstuffscosts by increases in efficiency.,     Efficiency is increasingrapidly in the egg industry but producers will take a possibility-mistic vie?/ of prospects - especially if we fail to get the Sixto agree to supplement the present Regulation with arrangements for community intervention^(f) On milk it is difficult to assess the likely outcome until we have discussed with the Six the detailed implementation ofthe common policy for milk and milk productso     Our latest thinkingis that, by accepting the harmonisation of milk products priceswithin the Community and by claiming the right to a higherreturn from the sales of liquid milk because of the specialcircumstances of our market we might be able to maintain producerprice at around the present level of 32do a gallon (comparedwith the average in the Six of about 30d.)*     But there is muchuncertainty and we may not be allowed to maintain an ex-farm price above the average for the Six,.     There is clearly apossibility that increased production generally inside an enlarged community would in any case require a reduction in the price for milk in order to limit total outputo     Moreover, producers&apos; costs will go up with the higher prices for feedings tuffs.     With, some25 per cent of net farm income-in the United Kingdom coming frommilk and so many of our farmers heavily dependent on the milkcheque, even a small reduction in the price and a small increasein costs would be of great significance.-2-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ^  ,(g) On the other guaranteed commodities - sugar and potatoes -there should he no great change in the income posit ion i *7 0provided satisfactory common policies are worked out and &apos;;Qimplemented.(h) The horticultural industry will have to face increasedcompetition and a serious loss of income.     How serious theeffects would he will depend on the length of the standstillperiod which we can secure to enable the industry to adaptitself to the new situation, the use the industry can make ofit and the financial assistance which the Government are ableto give them.      (I am circulating a separate paper on financial assistance to the horticultural industry.)Direct Farming Grantsif..     The future of our direct farming grants is a furtherunknown factor in trying to assess the effect on farm income of our accession.     At present, direct Exchequer grants to agriculture and horticulture total some  100 million annually - roughly a quarter of the industry&apos;s net income.Schemes  accounting for some  70- 80 million of this total willbe at risk under the provisions of the Treaty which provide that our grants will be subject to scrutiny by the Commission,who may require us to terminate or modify any that areincompatible with the Community&apos;s rules of competition.     our aim is to keep as much as possible of the present total valueof direct grants intact, and when the terms for agricultureare settled we shall be expected to give some reassurance toour industry on this point.     It is important, therefore, thatwe secure from the Six some agreement that will enable us totell the industry that they can expect this form of aid tocontinue on something like its present scale.Participation in working out common ap;ri cultural policy5-     The Regulations so far adopted by the Six deal  withcommodities that in total account for only about i+5 per cent of the value of farm sales.     Even if we are able to negotiateacceptable arrangements for these and for any other commoditiesfor which the Six may adopt Regulations before we take a decisionto accede, we must have a worthwhile undertaking from the Sixthat between initialling and ratification we shall have an effective say in the arrangements for those commodities -especially milk - which have still to he settled.     Only if wesecure this and, as an indication that this undertaking isworthwhile, some modification in the Six&apos;s regulations for eggs and pigmeat, will farmers believe my protestations that the new system will give them as solid an assurance as the existingguarantees.conclusion.     I will develop orally the probable effect on the overallincomes of farmers in this country, assuming a &quot;reasonable price policy&quot;.7*     The farmers are still not reconciled to the fact that weshould not be able to continue taking decisions unilaterallyto safeguard their interests if we join the Common Market.They are likely to make much of this point unless the overall-settlement for United Kingdom agriculture can be presented assatisfactorily safeguarding their interests.    I am going tohave the greatest difficulty in putting this prospect across tothe farming community and in convincing them that they have nothing to fear.     With this difficult task ahead, we shall need to secure every concession still available in the next stage ofthe negotiations.
