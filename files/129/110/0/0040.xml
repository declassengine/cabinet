186Memorandum      the irregident of the Board of TradeIn his paper C. (62) 139, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes that the functions of the National Incomes Commission (N. I. C.) shouldbe extended to enable it to examine, at the request of the Government&quot;the circumstances of an industry which is consistently increasing itsprofit and dividend record by more than the increases of national productivity, and where there is reason to believe that such increase may be running contrary to the national incomes policy as a whole,which will have been determined by the Government after receiving the advice of the National Economic Development Council (N. E. D. C. )!&apos;In my view there are strong objections both of policy and of practicaladministration to this course.2.      To take the latter first, I do not think that the term &quot;industry&quot;is meaningful in this context.    Profits are made not by industries butby individual enterprises.    Many enterprises are engaged in morethan one industry in the sense of more than one form of manufacture(e.g. , the General Electric Company, which makes everythingelectrical from the largest generating plant to a domestic iron, orMetal Industries, whose activities range from ship breaking to themanufacture of small electronic equipment);  but their rate of profitis related to their operations as a whole.     It is a difficult and time-consuming business, as the experience of the Monopolies Commissionand the Restrictive Practices Court has shown, to obtain an agreedanalysis of a firm&apos;s profit broken down by its various activities.For this reason I doubt whether it makes sense to talk of the average rate of profit bei: g made in an industry as if it were somethingeasily determined.    It should also be remembered that almost80 per cent of all registered companies are exempt private companies and do not publish accounts.     The only source of information about their profits is the Inland Revenue.3.      It also seems to me quite unjustifiable to imply that becausean industry&apos;s profitability is increasing faster than national productivity, it may be suspect.     This would be to put in jeopardyjust those enterprises to which we shall have to look to secure anincrease in the rate of growth of the economy as a whole.     It isnot high profits by themselves that matter, it is the way in whichthey are secured.     If once we take powers to refer a high rate ofCABINETNATIONAL INCOMES COMMISSION
profit growth as such to the Commisoioa foi- investigation, we shall be under constant pressure to put under the harrow just those industries which are most enterprising and efficient, and it would be verydifficult to refuse to make a reference to the Commission on theground that there was no reason, to believe that increases in profits and dividends in a particular case did not run counter to national incomes policy as a whole.     The whole process would certainly bevery disturbing to industry and detrimental to the expansion whichwe are seeking to encourage.4,      It is therefore crucial that, before considering having any industry investigated, the Government should have some  ri^aJSSiievidence that the high rate of growth of profit is attributable to the exploitation of monopoly strength.    In that event, however, there isno need to load the National Incomes Commission with this furthertask:   we already have in the Monopolies Commission a body set upby statute to do this very thing.     When the Government make a reference to the Monopolies Commission the rate of profit made bythe monopoly is always one of the matters investigated.     The point which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has in mind could thereforebe met quite adequately by an announcement to the effect that theGovernment will refer to the Monopolies Commission any case inwhich either it appears to them that an industry has been exploitinga monopoly position so as to acquire excessive profits or theN. I. C. recommend that such a reference should be made.     TheBoard of Trade are at present reviewing the powers and procedure of the Monopolies Commission and their own powers to enforcethose recommendations of the Commission that the Governmentapprove.    Admittedly the Commission&apos;s enquiries take time tocomplete, but this is due to the inherent complexity of the problems which they have to consider and there is no reason to think that theNational Incomes Commission could be more expeditious.5.      I also believe that an extension of M. I. Cs functions toinclude the investigation of monopolies without any of the statutorysafeguards of the 1948 Act is bound to alarm the employers.    Asthe Chancellor of the Exchequer says, N. I. C. has few supporters.The employers have at least been willing to give it a trial.    If welose them, the proposal will be as good as dead.F. J. E.Board of Trade, 5. W. 1.12th September, 1962.
