Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 120 Copy No.   6 020th July, 1962CABINETTHE BRITISH SHIPPING industry memorandum by the Minister of transport in accordance with the Cabinefs discussion on 31st May, I am circulating thisreport on the problems of the shipping industry and my proposals for government action (C.C. (62) 39th Conclusions, Minute 7).The General situation. The British merchant marine, although proportionately smaller in theworld than before the last war, is still the world&apos;s largest active merchant fleet andit contains a good proportion of modern ships. Nevertheless, I am most concerned about its prospects.3. Earnings have been very inadequate for several years and many shipping companies are known to be barely covering depreciation, and some not that. Theshipping industry is accustomed to large fluctuations in its fortunes but its moraleis now low.4. The most alarming symptom is the rate of ordering of new ships, whichis running at no more than a third of the rate required for replacement.5. The implications of this are also very serious for the United Kingdomshipbuilding industry, which normally sells about 80 per cent, of its output toBritish owners. If the present level of orders continues, the industry will have to contract by about half.6. The basic cause of the present state of the British shipping industry is, ofcourse, the world surplus of ships. (This point and the industry&apos;s prospectsgenerally are dealt with in the Annex.) But other countries&apos; shipowners are notin general so gloomy as our own, and have not cut down their orders so drastically.In fact, one of the reasons that British owners give for their own holding back isthat enough new ships have been or are being ordered throughout the world toprevent any improvement in earnings. I must emphasise that the confidence ofBritish owners, and with it the level of their orders, may well fall lower still. Inthat event shipbuilders, some of whom have been comforting themselves with the thought that British owners cannot hold off ordering much longer, will reactsharply; and several yards may be closed.7. It should be borne in mind that in the 1930&apos;s the Government felt compelledto give financial aid for our fleet. Although the British shipping industry has notasked for a subsidy, the shipbuilding unions have for some time advocated theGovernment^ subsidising a scrap-and-build scheme, and the shipbuildingemployers may soon add pressure of their own. The shipbuilding unions are alsonow talking about direct Government orders for merchant ships.The Reasons8. All shipping is suffering from a general surplus of tonnage. World freight rates have been depressed for several years, whereas costs have risen. Britishshipowners have been faced with large increases in seamen&apos;s wages during the last few years and must now expect another.1120ATHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
9. This situation is made worse by the fact that many foreign Governmentsprevent our shipowners from charging remunerative freight rates and even fromcarrying certain cargoes altogether. This trend towards policies of flagdiscrimination and unilateral regulation, supported in some cases by subsidies, is increasing both in the United States and elsewhere. The United Kingdom suffersout of proportion from these forms of interference, since they have their mainimpact on liner trades and 70 per cent, of our foreign-going dry cargo tonnageconsists of liners.What the Government must do10.   Our objectives should be (a) to secure for our shipping a fair field internationally;(b) to help it develop its managerial and technical efficiency.11. The Economic Policy Committee are supervising a study of the ways inwhich we might combat the nationalist activities of other Governments in theshipping field. We must protect our right to sell the services of our shipping at least as vigorously as we resist obstructions to our export of goods.12. To maximise the industry&apos;s efficiency, we must encourage, and where necessary contribute to, co-operative efforts within the industry. It has a tradition of individualism, but firms have now agreed in principle to organise collectiveeconomic research; and the shipbuilders&apos; research organisation will in futureundertake technical investigations for owners as well as builders. These develop-ments have needed considerable prompting from myself, and the Governmentwill need to continue their encouragement and to give some financial help, as we doelsewhere. We must help our firms to ensure that they order the right kind of ships and go for the profitable trades, which means foreseeing correctly both economicand technical trends.Specific Measures13.   Specifically, I propose the following:(a) Appointment of a Shipping Advisory Panel tAfter consultation with the other Ministers concerned, I am appointingan advisory panel, under my chairmanship, consisting of representatives of bothsides of the shipping industry, of other industry, and of the Ministry ofTransport and the Board of Trade. I shall announce this before the Recess.This panel will consider both the international and the economic and technical questions that affect the industry&apos;s prosperity. I look on this as a cardinalmeasure, because this panel will provide impetus and direction for all we do.I am grateful to the President of the Board of Trade for offering to contributea senior representative.(b) Establishment of a Research UnitI propose to appoint a small staff in my department, headed by aneconomist and a scientist, to carry out, in conjunction with the industry, studiescalled for by the advisory panel or otherwise. My department is in touchwith the Treasury about this.(c) Training of officers the Government^ general policy favours properly organised vocational training. My Parliamentary Secretary, with the help of the Ministry ofEducation, has been discussing with the industry plans for training merchant navy Engineer Officers, and the industry is ready for improved collectivearrangements. I think we will have to make a financial contribution.(d) Technical ResearchWe should encourage technical research that can increase the profitability of our shipping, working primarily through the British Ship ResearchAssociation (the combined shipowners&apos; and shipbuilders&apos; organisation. I mentioned in paragraph 12).The Government are already contributing to research on shipbuilding,partly by paying a grant to this organisation and partly by conducting research
in Government establishments: we should now contribute financially to research on shipping, for example on automatic controls and improved meansof handling cargoes. (Japan, Russia and America, which subsidise theirfleets, are all building experimental labour-saving ships.) The Minister for science and I are in touch over this and we shall be consulting the First Lordof the Admiralty.(e) Promoting StandardisationMuch money can be saved by standardising ships and components ofships. Standardisation is not easy. A ship should be suited to a particulartrade. Too much standardisation of components impedes technicalimprovement. But judicious standardisation can bring great benefits to both our shipowners and our shipbuilders. My department and the department for Scientific and Industrial Research must pursue this..14. I should like to announce proposals on these lines when parliament reassembles in the autumn. My department will be discussing them with theTreasury and other departments meanwhile. I contemplate that we might spend 1 or  2 million a year in helping the industry in these ways, in addition to the  3 million over 2-3 years we contemplate spending on research into nuclear shippropulsion and the present effort of the Department of Scientific and industrial research on shipbuilding. But I am not asking for a decision now, except thatthese matters, and the ways of helping our shipping internationally, should be pursued energetically during the summer. I will report again in October. I should add that I do not wish to exclude the possibility of my coming forward later withrather more ambitious proposals if they hold a real prospect of acceleratingrecovery in the shipping or shipbuilding industry.Ports15. I should mention, for completeness, the question of ports, on which Iappointed a strong outside committee to advise me. Their report is likely to be printed and ready for publication by October. They will report that moreinvestment in our ports is needed if our industry and our shipping are not behandicapped compared with those of the Continent; but they are likely, I believe,to recommend that the ports should raise the necessary money themselves ratherthan be subsidised. They will also have far-reaching recommendations to make on organisational matters, such as the future of the ports at present owned by theBritish Transport Commission and the degree of autonomy that should be enjoyed by the independent ports. I shall be consulting my colleagues when I have receivedthe report. The Government must be ready with their comments on all majorpoints when the report is published. It will not, I think, be a popular document.Conclusion16.   I invite the Cabinet:(a) To note that the British shipping industry, and in consequence the Britishshipbuilding industry also, face serious difficulties.(b) To agree that the Government should pursue energetically proposals forgiving the shipping industry a fair field internationally and for encouraging and as necessary assisting measures to increase its efficiency,on the lines described in paragraphs 9-13, with the aim, if possible, of announcing proposals in the autumn.(c) To note that the report of the advisory committee on the ports is likely tobe received shortly and that the Governments comments on its main recommendations will need to be announced when it is published inthe autumn.E. M.Ministry of Transport,20th July, 1962.
annex the PROSPECTS OF BRITISH shipping the World SituationBritish shipping is not, of course, protected by tariffs, like most of Britishmanufacturing industry; and its earnings depend on the world situation.2. The active merchant fleets of the world are appreciably larger than is needed to carry world trade economically, especially in oil and grain. New ships already under construction have fully enough capacity for the foreseeable increasein world trade during the next few years.3. The crux is whether over-ordering will continue. There are a largenumber of factors at work and prediction is extremely difficult.4. The main cause of the present surplus of tonnage is that shipping madelarge profits during the shortage of shipping after World War II, during the korean war and after the closing of the Suez Canal and that the oil companiesgreatly overestimated demand. Shipping provided an ideal opportunity forentrepreneurs who wished to avoid taxation: there was an enormous increase inthe merchant fleets of Liberia and Panama. Concurrently the shipping of the traditional maritime countries like Britain expanded with world trade and insome cases (Norway in particular) considerably faster, in response to normaleconomic forces. Finally, a considerable expansion was brought about by government action, for example, in Japan and Russia, and also in countries that had not had fleets of any size before, such as Israel, India and Pakistan. Thereasons why Governments have done this are manifold; many countries believethat owning ships has strategic advantages and brings prestige: ships can be operated without a strong industrial base in the owning country, and so provide an under-developed country with a way to save foreign exchange: and nationalshipping can be used to support a national shipbuilding industry. A factor thathas prolonged world over-ordering is that there is a world surplus of shipbuilding capacity; and when the demand for ships began to slacken the shipyards, helpedin many cases by their Governments, stimulated it by offering uneconomic prices and generous credit terms.5. In the long term one would expect that the sight of owners in difficultiesbecause of over-ordering will act as a deterrent. In particular, internationalspeculators are unlikely to foresee a return of the period when a ship could repayher capital cost in a few years. On the other hand, subsidisation and protectionare habits not easily discontinued. There can be little hope that the trend away from free competition in world shipping will be reversed in our lifetime.Moreover, there are credible reports that the Russians plan to quadruple theirfleet by 1980. This would give them a fleet as large as the largest in the world to-day and provide them with the means to open an economic offensive againstthe West on the shipping front.Prospects for British Shipping6. It is not impossible for high-wage economies to undersell. low-wageeconomies in providing cargo shipping. Admittedly there are limits to what canbe done to reduce wage-costs by investing capital in larger and better-equippedships. Admittedly also British crews tend to be on the large side. However, thewages of crews amount, on the average, to no more than about one-quarter of ship owners&apos; total outgoings. Competence in operation (i.e., obtaining a quickturn-round in ports, obtaining cargoes so that the ship is fully loaded, avoidingaccidents, keeping down maintenance costs and saving fuel) is fully as important as wage rates.7. Passenger shipping is another matter. Wages are a higher proportion oftotal costs. A passenger ship must be regarded not merely as a means of transportation but as a hotel; and in the hotel business the cost of services must always bulk large.
8. British shipping, besides being backed by an advanced economy, enjoystwo advantages (1) Britain has a long-established position of dominance in many trades, whichis protected by agreements with other shipowners and with shippers,derived from a long history of giving shippers what they want. On theother hand a number of Governments throughout the world are seekingundermine, for the benefit of their own countries&apos; shipping, thearrangements that British shipping has been able to secure.(2) Britain is a country with a large sea-borne trade of its own. Admittedlyour shipping would be in a bad way if it was reduced to carrying halfthe total of British imports and exports and lost its employment oncarrying trade between other countries; but at least it is not so exposedas, e.g., the Norwegian shipping industry.9. On the other hand (a) British shipping has the disadvantage of being thelargest user of British ports; (b) a large proportion of its competitors enjoyGovernment subsidy or protection or both; (q) the management of some shippingfirms is weak, and the industry as a whole tends to be old-fashioned. The last is,of course, of critical importance to its ability to counteract the effect of high wagesby competence in operation.10. At present most British passenger shipping and tramp cargo shipping is probably not doing much more than covering direct operating costs; and someis not even doing that. Cargo liners seem to be operating more profitably, butat a lower level of return on capital than in most manufacturing industry.11. Looking at the future, it appears that, in the short term, there is little or no prospect of an improvement for British shipping, whatever anyone does. this does not mean that a large contraction will immediately set in: owners will continueto operate the ships they have, and it is in the shipyards that the short-term effectsare being felt. In the longer term everything depends on how far the industry&apos;scompetitiveness can be improved and how far it can be given a fair field forcompetition. It is difficult at present to avoid the impression that some declinenot merely in the British share of world shipping but in the size of the british merchant fleet is inevitable. On the other hand it would be defeatist to suppose that no action the Government takes to stimulate or help the industry can have any significant effect.British Orders for New Ships12. The most immediately serious feature in the present situation is that whereas a few years ago British orders for new ships were big enough not merely to replace but enlarge the fleet, for the past three years they have been running at no more than one-third of the replacement rate.13. This has not continued long enough to condemn the shipping industryto a contracting or obsolescent fleet; the situation could be retrieved. There maybe an element of &quot; wait and see &quot; in this holding back. Moreover, some ownersmay estimate that the price of ships will go down still further. Credit terms arenot an important factor: many shipowners have emphasised that they would haveno difficulty in finding the money for new ships if they saw a prospect of operatingthem at a profit. The main reasons are that shipowners see no present likelihood of the world profitability of shipping improving or of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentscountering the hostile actions of other Governments; and that many of them believethat Britain will join the Common Market and that long-haul sea traffic will be diminished in consequence, including, in particular, certain traffics, like that inrefrigerated meat, for which specialised fleets have been built up.14. The reason why this lack of confidence on the part of British owners is so serious is its effect on British shipyards.15. The shipbuilding industry has not been doing too badly recently in gettingforeign orders. It has been improving its equipment and its management and itsreputation now stands higher than for some years past. It has long recognised thatit cannot expect to see again the boom of the first 10 years after the war and thatit is living in a world grossly over-provided with shipbuilding capacity, much ofwhich is subsidised or protected by Governments.   It had hoped, however, that
Government Action about Shipping17. Much could be written about the economic factors bearing on the merits of a large or a small shipping industry and similar points. However, it wouldlargely be academic, because in present circumstances the Government^ actions mustbe determined by certain over-riding factors.18.   As to what should not be done:(a) A general subsidy is liable to be demoralising, as the Americans, forexample, have discovered.   It should be avoided if at all possible.(b) There is no present need to conclude that the possibilities of our remaininga carrier of other countries&apos; trade are so small that we should resort tosimple protection.(c) The Government should reject any suggestion that it should fix a figure for a reduced size of the shipping industry, and &quot; plan&quot; with theindustry a contraction to that size. There is no adequate basis onwhich such a figure could be calculated; the Government would attractto itself both odium for reducing the industry and responsibility for maintaining it thereafter at the planned figure; and the Governmentwould find itself responsible for deciding which firms should live andwhich die.19. As to positive measures, the size of the national assets of shipping and shipbuilding, in the form of skill and experience, international position andindustrial and social investment, is such that the Government (a) must take counter-measures against actions by other Governments in theshipping field where useful counter-measures can be identified;(b) must help the industry, by advice and, where appropriate, financialassistance, to be as competitive as possible. Measures of this kind are discussed in the main paper.with a British Merchant Navy of about 20 million tons, it would get about 1 million ^tons a year of orders from British owners; and this, with no more than the presentflow of foreign orders, would leave it in a reasonably healthy condition.   But with.British orders now running at no more than J million tons a year, it is facing aserious contraction.16. The workpeople displaced from the shipyards in the last few years have,in general, had no great difficulty in finding other employment, with the exceptionof those in Northern Ireland. If British orders remain at their present level,however, there might be unemployment in nearly all places where ships are built.
