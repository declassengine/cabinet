i! CONFIDENTIAL ----CiI62jJ.04: COPY NO.     kl3rd July, 1962CABINETREAPPRAISAL, OF THE COAL, INDUSTRYMemorandumof the exchequer the market for coal has been contracting, and it is necessaryto improve the competitiveness and profitability of the industry;  anda reappraisal of the future of the industry has therefore been madeby a Group under the Chairmanship of the Ministry of Power, withrepresentatives of the Treasury, the Board of Trade and the national coal Board.   The Minister of Power has presented proposals, basedon the Group&apos;s report, to the Economic Policy Committee (E,A. (62) 81).The Committee endorsed the Ministers proposals, which are listed inparagraph 20 of his memorandum, subject to points referred to below,but considered that in view of their social and political implicationsand of their relation to other aspects of economic policy they should bevconsidered by the Cabinet.   I am accordingly reporting in this paper the main points made in discussion.Closures policy .      The main discussion in the Committee was on point (i) of theMinister&apos;s conclusions, viz, , that the Government should support theBoard&apos;s policy of closing losing collieries - i. e. , mines making no contribution to gross profit or depreciation - as rapidly as possible.3.      There was general approval of this policy, but it was recognisedthatthis would create formidable social and political problems which lay outside themining industry and for which the Board should not be^regarded as res-ponsible.      In some communities in Scotland, Northumberland, durham and Wales the impact would be serious, and might result in waste of social investment.   Moreover, while the rundown in uneconomic indusrty was inevitable, the contraction in coal mining (and prospectivelyin the railways) was happening with particular suddenness and mightbe attributed to Government policy.Immedia^Action4.      The immediate action to be taken by the Government to deal withthis situation is being considered by the Distribution of IndustryCommittee.   A working party of officials has been set up, under Ministryof Labour chairmanship, to consider the problems of handling the coalclosures (and the railway redundancies)?-   and I gather that the Distribu-tion of Industry Committee is considering this week a draft statement on the Scottish closures to be made on 11th July.-1-CO N Fl DENTIALm*(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5.      This statement will, I understand, emphasise that the national coal Board expect to be able to re-absorb in other pits the bulk ofthe miners displaced;  and will set out appropriate provisions for training under the Government Training Scheme, training allowances, etc.There will be reference also to further action to encourage the expansionof new industry and the development of new industry in Scotland.Longer-Term Implications6.      In our discussion at the Economic Policy Committee, there was some difference of emphasis about the way in which the Governmentshould approach the social problems involved.   It was agreed that thepowers of the Local Employment Act, I960, should be used as far aspracticable, but there was considerable doubt about their effectiveness.Some members felt, for example, that in the present state of the economy there were few projects for industrial expansion which werepotentially mobile;  and that it was impossible to get industry to move into the development districts unless vigorous economic growth was taking place.   The closures themselves might reduce economic activity,if they reduced the orders placed with the engineering industry, or because the repeated public statements and speculation about contractionsundermined business confidence generally.   On the other hand, thetransfer of labour from uneconomic industries was desirable for national economic efficiency and growth, and there was a limit(emphasised by the need to compete in the Common Market) to theextent to which we could sensibly induce industry to move to relativelyremote areas against its own preferences.   On the other hand again,some members said that experience showed that some firms which had moved to development districts had found that their costs were reduced.7.     Members of the Committee were generally agreed that a com-prehensive review was urgently needed of the Government^ policy on the distribution of industry and of poiDulation.   This review could include an examination of the relative costs of moving industry to areasof high unemployment and of providing the necessary social investmentif, as an alternative, the people wei-e to move to the areas where jobswere available;   and of the possibility of more drastic inducements.It was agreed that it was important to reach decisions on distributionpolicy quickly, for there was a danger that unless the Government were seen to be tackling this problem effectively, public anxiety might mountquickly and force the Government to slow down the contraction programme the Minister of Power&apos;s other proposals.      The other proposals in paragraph 20 of the memorandum bythe Minister of Power - the financial target (ii), capital reconstruction(iii), coal imports(iv), and legislation (v) - were agreed.   On (ii),the Minister will emphasise that the target will be subject to revieweach year in the light of events inside and outside the coal industry:on (iii), it was recognised that there might be pressure in parliament for capital reconstruction, but the Board were not seeking it at present:on (iv), it was suggested that the coal import policy should be reviewedwithin a year.L,Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.3rd July, 1962-2-CONFIDENTIAL
