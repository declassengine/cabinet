Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 108 Copy No.   6 16th July, 1962CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE pensions memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general public service pensions were last increased by the Pensions (Increase) Act,1959, and corresponding Prerogative Instruments for Her Majesty&apos;s Forces with effect from 1st August, 1959. Since that date the Index of Retail Prices has risen by 9-9 per cent., while wage rates have risen by almost exactly the same amount and earnings and National Insurance retirement pensions have increased substantially faster. The increase of 9 - 9 per cent, is greater than the increase which took place between the effective dates of the 1956 and 1959 Pensions (Increase)Acts.A New Measure of Pensions Increase2. I therefore consider that the time has come to announce a comprehensivenew measure of pensions increase, including parallel action for pensioners of her majesty&apos;s Forces, to be made payable as soon as the necessary Bill is passed in thenew session.3. I propose that the basic provisions of such a measure should be substantially on the lines of that of 1959, which gave increases (on total pensions,i.e., including any existing increases) ranging from 12 per cent, for retirementsbefore 31st March, 1952, to 2 per cent, for pensions awarded between 31st March,1956, and 31st March, 1957. If a Bill is introduced early in the new session the increases can be made effective from some date early in 1963, the date depending on the exact prospects of the legislative programme. This will be about 1\ yearsafter the effective date of the previous Bill. I propose, therefore, that the &quot; cut-off &quot;dates which determine which pensions should receive increases, and of whatamounts, should be advanced by four years as compared with the 1959 Bill. Thiswill mean that all pensions dating from 1st April, 1956, or earlier will attract thefull increase of 12 per cent.; those beginning later, which have benefited from thehigher rates of salary prevailing, will receive an increase decreasing by steps of2 per cent, for each year, until pensions beginning after 1st April, 1961, attractno increase at all. The new increases would be payable on the total pension in payment (i.e., including any increases under previous pensions increase measures).4. In addition, I propose that the really old pensioners should be given anadditional flat-rate supplement of  20 a year (7s. 6d. a week) for those over 70,or on attainment of age 70, subject to a &quot; taper &quot; for those who retired after1st April, 1956, and to a provision to avoid disproportionate increases in certainsmall pensions (for example those awarded for short service in the civil public services).Cost5. The annual cost of a measure on these lines to the taxpayer and ratepayerwill be about  20  million of which about  14  million is accounted for by themain scheme (paragraph 3) and about  6 million by the additional provision forthis document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government
the over-seventies (paragraph 4). Details are in Annex. In addition the nationalised industries may be expected to follow suit, and will incur expenditure which will be a charge on their revenues and thus generally on the consumers ofthe services; but the taxpayer will have to bear the cost, over and above the figureof  20^ million, of any concession that might be made by the British transport commission. No provision for any measure of Pensions Increase has been madein the Forecast Estimates for 1963-64 which, after adjustment, now stand at 6,050 million, an increase of  438 million over the Estimates for 1962-63 as presented.Overseas Pensioners6. The announcement of a further measure of increase for United Kingdompensioners will intensify public pressure for relief for pensioners of the Sudan and oversea civil services whose former employing Governments pay pensions increase on a scale less generous than that of the United Kingdom Acts. After discussionwith myself and my colleagues concerned, the Secretary for Technical Co-operationhas set up a Working Party to examine the practicability of acting to relieve thesepensioners; and it has been publicly announced that the Working Party has been set up and that it is to report in the autumn. Without anticipating therecommendations of the Working Party, my own expectation is that these will lead us to conclude that some measure of assistance by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the oversea service pensioners referred to above is desirable. If such a conclusion is reached, the time to announce it will be at the beginning of next Session; andthe Pensions Increase Bill would then contain the provision necessary to give effectto this new policy. In view of the shortage of time for drafting, this provision mighthave to take the form of a fairly wide enabling power. Questions on the subject of oversea pensioners at the time of the forthcoming announcement in principle ofthe intention to introduce a pensions increase measure should, I suggest, be answered by referring to the Working Party and promising a statement as soon aspossible after its report is completed.7. No provision has been included in the figures of cost in paragraph 5 above for the cost of &quot; topping up &quot; pensions increase to pensioners of overseas territories in this way.Incomes policy. I envisage that the immediate announcement would be in quite general terms and would not refer to any percentage figures. But in due course details ofthe proposals will have to be disclosed, and we may then have to answer enquires as to its consistency with our incomes policy. So far as concerns pensioners under70 who will benefit from the basic provisions of the Bill only, we shall have to rely on the argument that some 3^ years will have elapsed between 1st August, 1959(the operative date of the last Act), and early 1963; for those eligible for themaximum increase of 12 per cent, this yields an annual rate of 3-4 per cent. Theannual slice of this attributable to 1962 will still (retrospectively) have exceeded the &quot;guiding light&quot;; but in the prevailing climate of public and Parliamentaryopinion I doubt if we shall be severely criticised for this. The additional fiat-ratepayment to the over-70s will increase the percentage benefit to the smallerincreases. The smallest pensions would get a maximum increase of 37 per cent, in total (12 per cent, under the basic provisions and an increase not exceeding25 per cent, in respect of the additional payment). A pension of  120 a year wouldhave a maximum increase of 29 per cent.; one of  500 one of 16 per cent.; andone of  1,000 14 per cent.: in all cases those retired since 1st April, 1956, would get less. The relatively high percentages would be defended (if necessary) by pointing out that at these levels absolute amounts and not only percentages are relevant.New Pensions: Possibility of Excessive Pension Benefit9. While old pensioners are suffering from the rise in prices, certain ofthose now retiring can receive altogether excessive retirement benefits throughthe combination of occupational pension and national insurance retirement pension; in an extreme case retirement benefits can amount to 115 per cent, ofretiring pay, and in many cases they materially exceed the ratio of two-thirds
Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th July, 1962.which has long been regarded as an appropriate standard. Statutory powers to&quot; modify &quot; public service occupational pensions to remedy this situation exist,but have not been much used. In the Civil Service, for example, the modificationof the occupational pension is still related to the 1948 level of national retirement pension. An official review of this problem is now in train, and I am not nowin a position to propose to my colleagues any changes in the system, but it seems desirable to take the opportunity of an announcement that we are to do somethingfor existing pensioners, to announce a review (which will certainly be unpopular)which may affect future pensioners. Any changes made in the arrangements for&quot; modifying&quot; public service pension arrangements would not affect anyonebenefiting under the measure of Pensions Increase proposed, as they would apply only to future retirements and not to those already &quot; exempt&quot;&apos;. Service widowswould not in any case be affected at all.Conclusions and Recommendations10.   I invite my colleagues-to agree that:.........-----    ..........(a) we should now announce, in general terms only, a comprehensive measureof pensions increase;(b) the same announcement should include a warning that the Governmentare reviewing the arrangements to prevent excessive pensions beingcurrently awarded on new retirements;(c) a measure should be prepared on the lines of paragraphs 3 and 4 above,at a cost of about  20  million;(d) the necessary Bill should be given sufficient priority in the parliamentary programme for the increases to become effective early in 1963.H.
