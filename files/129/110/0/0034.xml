THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1962Copy No.  5 8CABINETCONGOMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and PaymasterGeneral1. I should like to draw the attention of my colleagues to what seem to meto be the financial implications of the proposals contained in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper (C. (62) 132).2. It is important to have in mind that we are already doing a great deal in the Congo. Our contribution to the military and administrative expenditureof the United Nations is costing us over $9 million a year. We have also recentlyagreed that this country should take up to $12 million of the current united nations Bond Issue, which is mainly required to finance the deficit arising fromthe failure of most other member countries (including France and Belgium aswell as the Soviet Union) to meet their share of United Nations expenditure inthe Congo.3. British exports to the Congo are now run at an annual level of about 4 million as compared with  10 million before independence. Most of the tradeis in the hands of a few large companies Unilever, British American Tobacco,and Shell which have capital investments totalling about  23 million in the Congoproper. If to this is added the value of direct and indirect investment in Katanga,for example the British share in Tanganyika Concessions&apos; holding in Union Minierethe total British stake is worth something less than  30 million. It does not seemto me therefore that there is any strong commercial case for aid in order to protectcommercial interests.4. Our aid programme as a whole is already likely, not only in this year,but for some time to come, to exceed very substantially the figure of  180 millionmentioned by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer in his statement of31st July, 1961, as the limit which he would not wish to see substantially exceeded.Last autumn the Economic Policy Committee endorsed the conclusions of theSecond Report of the Working Party on the Aid Programme, one of which wasthat &quot; fresh commitments should be accepted only when the case for doing so,and for adding further to total oversea aid thereby is exceptionally strong &quot;. Asimilar recommendation is being made on the Third Report of the Working Party.5. We are under great pressure to increase aid to Colonial territories nowemerging to independence and my colleagues may well think that such claims on what we can do are stronger than those of the Congo which we could well leave to countries which do not have our Colonial obligations.6. If a contribution of the order of $2 million, as proposed by the foreign secretary in paragraph 8 (a) of his paper, is likely to play a major part in achieving a settlement in the Congo, I would not dissent from its being offered. But I donot think that we should take on in addition long term commitments, nor do Ithink that we should substitute, as and when the possibility arises, aid for civil purposes for our present contribution towards the United Nations military expenditure.J.
