(62) .1.09 Copy No^J^6th July, 1962 ;CABINETTHE USE OF COMMITTEESMemorandum by the chief secretary to the treasury and paymaster general  have been struck, since I have been at the Treasury, by the tendency of reports from Government-appointed commissions and committees to force increases in Government expenditure and to limit our freedom to form our own views onthe right priorities for public spending. In answer to a Parliamentary question on 7th February, 1962, the Prime Minister indicated that there were as many as33 of these enquiries currently in progress, 27 of them having been establishedwithin the last two years or so (Hansard. Volume 653, No. 50, cols. 70-80). I want to-suggest that, in our own interest, we should keep the appointment of newcommissions and committees to the very minimum.2. There are of course cases where there is Advantage in the appointment ofah independent committee for example, where the issues are important socialones on which public opinion is confused and divided. Again, there is one case which the Cabinet recently discussed the proposal for a standing RoyalCommission on Pay where a commission might well prove of value in reducingthe problems that get created for us by the whole series of sectional committeesand commissions on pay in particular public services. But in other instances byappointing a committee we may be doing little more than shelving an awkwardproblem temporarily, instead of taking a decision which it is the Government^business to take then when ultimately the decision has to. be taken the freedomof action of the Government may be greatly circumscribed by the necessity to publish the committee&apos;s report.3. There are particular dangers for the Treasury in this matter. ministers are usually concerned, very properly, to ensure that a committee appointed toexamine a prescribed issue of policy should be free to consider it from all aspects.As a result, terms of reference are often wide; and since there are few problems which will not respond at least to some extent to the expenditure of more money,committees are only too apt to recommend an increase in remuneration orinvestment or subsidy as an essential element in the remedies which they prescribe.It is anyway not unnatural-for a body of experts who concentrate for a year ormore on the study of a particular field to come to feel that that field deserves ahigher priority than hitherto for Exchequer funds. The Treasury&apos;s difficulties arethereby multiplied; and the Government are put in the embarrassing position of having either to discover some reason for rejecting or ignoring the recommendationsof the committee, or to accept them despite the additional burden which theyimpose and the damage they may do to other causes which may be in greaterneed of Exchequer support but have attracted less publicity.4.- I suggest that we should henceforward make a conscious and determined effort to limit the appointment of committees and other advisory bodies to the relatively small number of&apos;cases (mostly concerned with social policy) where thenature of the issues involved really does make it clearly desirable to test responsibleand independent opinion before the Government commit themselves to a decisionof policy: that we should hesitate long- before appointing committees which mayattempt, from a sectional ^standpoint, to dispose of slices of national resources:that the Treasury should oe fully consulted before any new enquiry is launched:and that the terms of reference of those committees we do appoint should be carefully drawn so as to confine the field of enquiry to those aspects of the subject on which the Government really need advice.5.   I invite my colleagues to endorse, these suggestions.A - H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th July, 1962.
