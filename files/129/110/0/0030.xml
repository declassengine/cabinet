Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 130 Copy No.   6 027th July, 1962CABINETIMPORTS OF COTTON TEXTILES FROM PAKISTANMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will recall that, as I foreshadowed in my Memorandum on imports of Cotton Textiles of 29th May (C. (62) 90), India and Hong Kong haveagreed to limit their exports of cotton piece goods and made-ups to the presentceiling levels from the end of 1962, when the existing limitations lapse, until theend of 1965, and to introduce a new restriction on exports of yarn at the 1961 rate,provided Pakistan does likewise. They have already introduced the yarn restriction,as from 1st July, 1962, on the assumption that Pakistan will take similar action.2. Pakistan, however, has refused to accept these arrangements in spite ofrepeated requests. She argues that they do not give her room for expanding her exports of cotton textiles to Britain so as to earn resources for economic development; that her voluntary acceptance of the arrangements would undermineher case to the Six for more liberal treatment; and that we should make room forbigger imports from the Asian Commonwealth by cutting back our imports from third countries. She will therefore go no further than to accept a limitation for theyear 1963 alone and at higher levels (namely, a 20 per cent, increase for cloth and made-ups over the present ceiling level of 42- 5 million square yards and an increase on the yarn figure of 600,000 lb. to 3,600,000 lb.).3. This creates a most serious situation. Pakistani failure to agree will notonly cause the new arrangements on yarn from India and Hong Kong to break downbut also call in question the maintenance of the ceilings which India and HongKong have accepted for cloth and made-ups until the end of 1965.4. The Government are, however, fully committed not only to the Lancashireindustry but also to Parliament that the proposed levels will be maintained until theend of 1965. Only by virtue of this assurance have we been able to resist pressure from both sides of the House for an imposed cut-back of Commonwealth imports.In addition to this major consideration, a vital condition of the settlement we arehoping to negotiate in Brussels for the Category I countries is that our imports ofcotton textiles from India and Pakistan will be limited to &quot; approximately the level for which provision has been made in existing agreements or voluntaryundertakings &quot;. Doubts about our good faith on this point would jeopardise notonly the treatment of Commonwealth Asian textiles in the Brussels settlement butalso the treatment of the trade of Category I countries as a whole.5. It will, therefore, be seen that Pakistani belief that her acceptance would undermine her position in Brussels has no validity and is based on a misconception.As regards her other arguments, the essential point is that, even if it were possibleto cut back imports from third countries (and this would create major difficulties over a wide field), any increases in the ceilings granted to Pakistan would haveto be proportionately extended to India and Hong Kong who account for 90 per cent,of our imports from the Asian Commonwealth. This is unacceptable, especiallyin view of the acute political difficulties which have arisen vis-a-vis the Lancashireindustry where there is bitter opposition even to the ceilings at their present levels.
6. Against this background, I am convinced that we must make it clear to pakistan that, one way or the other including, if necessary, the use of quantitative restrictions, we cannot accept more cloth, made-ups or yarn from her than the suggested levels; that this must remain the position at least until the end of 1965;and that for presentational reasons in Britain, India and Hong Kong we must make this public in the very near future.7. This would not necessarily mean the immediate imposition of quotar^firictions in Britain on imports from Pakistan. It would mean, however, thata decision had been taken to impose such restrictions on default of Pakistaniacceptance of voluntary restraint at the proposed levels as soon as it became necessary to do so in order to prevent imports from Pakistan undermining thearrangements with India and Hong Kong. In the case of yarn, imports fromPakistan in the first six months of 1962 have been nil but action could be requiredwithin the next two or three months if they showed signs of approaching the 1961level. In the case of cloth and made-ups action could be deferred until the endof 1962 while the present voluntary arrangement limiting imports from Pakistanremains in force.8. If the imposition of quantitative restrictions on Pakistan textiles becomesunavoidable, this would be the first occasion, apart from State trading in jutegoods, that we had restricted imports of manufactured goods from a sterling commonwealth country. We should have to do this by means of a unilateralimport licensing control applicable only to Pakistan among commonwealth countries. This would be a major departure from our general policy of allowingunrestricted entry for Commonwealth goods into this country. The cotton textilesproblem, however, is recognised both at home and abroad as sui generis. This isclearly illustrated by the Geneva Arrangements on cotton textiles, including the recognition during the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) discussions that we were in a special position by reason of the decline which had already takenplace in our domestic industry as a result of the uniquely high level of low-costimports we are absorbing on the home market. To resist pressure from other Britishindustries for similar protection, we would have to justify our action domesticallyon these lines.9. The imposition of quantitative restriction would not be inconsistent withour Trade Agreement with Pakistan and, as regards the GATT, would be taken under the Long-Term Cotton Textiles Arrangement drawn up at Geneva inFebruary of this year if it comes into force and Pakistan is a signatory. Otherwise,we could not deny that our action would be a breach of the GATT but, ifchallenged, it would have to be defended on the grounds that we were acting inthe sense of the Geneva Arrangement and by using the arguments in paragraph 8above.10. I should add that, while we must recognise the possibility that our action might intensify the present nationalist pressures in Pakistan on our interests there,I doubt whether it would provoke her to serious retaliation against our export orinvestment interests, especially in view of her need for further Western investment and aid.11. I therefore seek authority for a decision to inform Pakistan ministers that, in default of their acceptance of the proposed arrangements, we would be compelled to make a public statement on the lines of paragraph 6 above in thenear future. This would be to the effect that, one way or the other (including, ifnecessary, the use of quantitative restrictions), we could not accept from Pakistanbetween now and the end of 1965 more cotton piece goods and made-ups thanthe present ceiling levels and more yarn than the 1961 rate of exports.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,27 th July, 1962.
