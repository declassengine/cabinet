t SECRETJTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1962C. (62) 124 Copy No.    6423rd July, 1962CABINETINCOMES policy memorandum by the Prime MinisterFollowing the Cabinefs discussion of my earlier paper (C. (62) 111) I havegiven further thought, with the Ministers concerned, to the scope of the proposed national Incomes Commission. I have also considered the way in which the new policy, as a whole, should now be presented. As the Cabinet will realise it is nolonger possible to think in terms of devoting Government time to a debate oneconomic affairs. The new policy will have to be presented in the course of the debate on Thursday, 26th July, on the Motion of Censure.2. The following paragraphs set out my proposals on the remaining points of substance which have not been settled in earlier discussion, and on procedure.National Incomes Commission3. It was suggested that it might be of value to empower the Commissionto review claims in course of settlement when either party could convince theCommission that a point of sufficient importance was involved. It was - inparticular thought that such an enlargement of the Commission^ powers mightbe welcome to the trades unions. As a result of further informal discussion withrepresentatives of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) it now seems probable thatthe most we can hope for is that the T.U.C. will reluctantly accept theestablishment of the Commission and could not be brought to welcome it. Toallow unilateral reference to a claim in course of negotiation to the commission for review might drive the T.U.C. into active opposition. In spite of this, theidea still has its attractions, and I should be reluctant to drop it altogether at thisstage.4. I propose, therefore, in the course of the speech in which I shall bedescribing the Commission^ functions in broad terms, to say that when the
Relationship between the Commission and Standing Review Committees5. We have envisaged that the Commission would subsume the review bodiesunder Lord Kindersley and Lord Franks and would also be brought into association with the Burnham Committee. On examination it appears that there should belittle difficulty about the Burnham Committee. It would not be appropriate, giventhe statutory basis of the Burnham Committee, for the Commission to be madeformally the arbitral body for teachers&apos; pay. But it might well have a useful role to play in advising upon a reference made to them by both sides of the burnham committee before submission of proposals to the Minister, especially south of the border where the Minister at present has powers only to say &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; to whatever the Burnham Committee may propose.6. There is more difficulty about the committees under Lord Kindersley andLord Franks, particularly the former. An undertaking was given to the doctors and dentists that the review body would be a group of independent persons not committed to the Governments point of view; and this was an important element in the package deal under which both the profession and the government accepted the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; Remuneration (Cmnd. 939). The British Medical Association would therefore be likely to represent any association between the Kindersley and theproposed Commission as being in breach of that undertaking. Nevertheless, it isclearly impossible in the context of the new incomes policy to appear to be placingdoctors and dentists and senior civil servants in a position which exempts them,and them only, from the Governments incomes policy. I shall have to recognisein my speech the need to establish a suitable relationship between the existingindependent committees, which provide the Government with advice on pay for doctors and dentists and the higher civil service, and the new Commission. Iintend to present this as something to be achieved over a period of time and by consultation. I will agree a form of words with the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland.Government judged a particular wage or salary claim to be of special importancethey would invite the parties concerned to refer the claim to the Commission for review. I would also suggest that it would seem to me inconceivable that in the face of so clear an indication by the Government that the national interest required the Commission to review a claim either of the responsible parties involved would refuse to go before it. Not only would the public draw their own conclusions from such a refusal; it would also invite an ex post facto inquiry by the Commission.I would then add that if in the event one of the parties to the claim did object toa reference to the Commission it. might still be in the national interest that theCommission should consider the claim; we recognise, however, that this is animportant and a delicate point and that full consultation would be required with both sides of industry before reaching a final decision.
Procedure7. (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer will be making arrangements toinform Lord Franks of the general scope of the Commission before Thursday^debate. Lord Kindersley is at present overseas and the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Health will arrange for a suitable communication to be sent to him. I intend myself to see representatives of the Trades UnionCongress and of the British Employers Confederation on Thursday morning. i will speak to them from a prepared text summarising the proposals and thedecisions which I shall be announcing in Parliament in the afternoon.(b) In the atmosphere of a debate on a Motion of Censure it is possible thatsome of the details of my speech may be lost. The Minister without Portfoliowill therefore arrange for a meeting with the Lobby and also with leader writersat which the main points of our policy can be put across; he will also arrange to distribute copies of the statement which I shall have used at my meeting with theBritish Employers Confederation and the Trades Union Congress in the morning.(c) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will consider what arrangements can best be made to present our policy on television on Thursdayevening. There is certain to be a demand for this as soon as the scope of the debate becomes clear and we must be ready to meet it.H. M.Admiralty House,20th July, 1962.
