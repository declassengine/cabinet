C. (62) 138 Copy No.   6 011th September, 1962CABINETRAILWAY WAGES AND salaries memorandum by the Minister of transport the Chairman of the British Transport Commission (B.T.C.), Dr. Beeching,is meeting the Railway Unions on 13th September, 1962, in the Railway StaffNational Council to hear their claim for a further increase in pay. The british transport Commission^ answer will probably be given at a meeting in the secondor third week of October. (The Railway Staff National Council is the ultimatenegotiating body for the Railway Salaried and Conciliation Grades. Claims whichare not settled in the Council can go to the Railway Staff National Tribunal for arbitration.)2. The February 1962 Award. In February 1962 the Unions accepted apay increase of 3 per cent, after negotiations which had been in progress since may 1961. The award was effective as from 1st April, 1962. Before accepting this increase, they had seen the Prime Minister, who told them that&quot; It would be open to the Unions to start discussions with Dr. Beechingagain later in the year, by which time it would be possible to see how therailways had fared and what improvement had taken place in the general economic situation. In improved circumstances it would be generally recognised that there were special factors affecting the railwaymen&apos;s case forsome amelioration.&quot;The actual terms of the settlement were that, after 1st April, 1962, &quot; any of theparties could, at their discretion, ask for discussions to be resumed at railway staff National Council level with a view to considering whether any freshadjustments could be made in the light of the circumstances then existing &quot;. Dr.Beeching was most careful to see that the word &quot; interim &quot; did not enter into theterms of the settlement. Despite this, the recorded decision of the National Unionof Railwaynien (N.U.R.) Executive was to &quot; recommend the acceptance of the3 per cent. ... as an interim settlement to be applied to all staff within the ambitof the B.T.C. &quot;.3. The present claims. The present claims were submitted simultaneouslyon 14th June, 1962, by the National Union of Railwaymen, the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.), and the Transport SalariedStaffs Association (T.S.S.A.). The wording of the claims was :N.U.R. Referring to the settlement in February 1962) &quot;to seek an early meeting of the Railway Staff National Council with a view to a resumptionof negotiations on the Wages Claim &quot;.A.S.L.E.F. For resumption of negotiations on their claims &quot; for animprovement in the standard rates of pay, the elimination of the classification of Drivers and improvement in the relativity of theFireman&apos;s rate in relation to that of the Guard &quot;. (By &quot; eliminating the classification of drivers &quot;, the Union mean giving the shunting driver againPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1962
the same wages as the main-line driver. The Guiilebaud reportrecommended that the main-line driver should get a lead, and the B.T.C:implemented this recommendation.)T.S.S.A. For a further meeting of the National Council to resume negotiations on their claim &quot; for an increase in the rates of pay of british railways salaried staff to maintain and be in accordance with theprinciples established by the settlement arising from the report of theRailway Pay Committee of Inquiry &quot; (i.e., Guillebaud).It will be seen that in no case is a specific figure put to the claims, which are largely a restatement of those submitted in May 1961. These were:N.U.R. A &quot; substantial increase &quot; in view of rises in the pay of comparableindustries (defined in discussion as a rise of some 11 per cent.).A.S.L.E.F. A 10 per cent, increase, together with elimination of the classification of Drivers and improvement in the relative pay of Firemen.T.S.S.A. -An increase to maintain and be in accordance with Guillebaudprinciples.The Unions are therefore likely on 13th September to revert to the contention thattheir pay should bear the same relation to outside industry as that which was established at the time of the Guillebaud settlement.4. The Guillebaud Committee were not appointed by the Government, butjointly by the B.T.C. and the Unions at the end of 1958. Their terms of reference were to conduct an investigation into the relativity of pay of railway staff withthe pay of other industries, and in connexion with this:(i) To establish the degree of job comparability.(ii) To ascertain the rates of pay and such other emoluments of the jobscompared as might properly be taken into account.(iii) To take account of other relevant factors in assessing comparability.They reported on 2nd March, 1960. Their recommendations were for a 10 percent, rise in salaries and 8 per cent, rise in wages of railwaymen, with additionalrises of from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent, for certain categories. They also recommended that the existing number of wages grades be reduced from 150 to 12.(The lowest grade now comprises porters, crossing keepers, permanent waylabourers, carriage servicemen, locomotive shedmen, engine . cleaners andhandymen, comprising about 60,000 or one-fifth of the conciliation grades.) TheB.T.C. gave broad effect to all the recommendations as from 4th January, 1960.The Governments attitude to the Guillebaud Report was expressed by thePrime Minister in a statement to the House on 10th March, 1960. He said theGovernment accepted the underlying objective of fair and reasonable wages. he did not, however, commit the Government to acceptance for all time of comparability between pay and that of outside industry according to the formulaadopted by Guillebaud.5. The Facts about Comparability. -My colleagues may like to see theattached table. Under the Guillebaud settlement, which gave the lowest-paidrailway workers an increase of 8 per cent, as from 4th January, 1960, these workers had a basic wage of 168s. weekly which was Is. 6d. (or 0-9 per cent.) less thanthe median of the various pay rates of themselves and 12 other industries selected for comparison, all of which, like themselves, were then on a 44-hour week. by 1st April, 1962, all of them had had reductions in hours and further increases in wages (in some cases more than one increase). Even after the railwaymen had got their 3 per cent, increase on 1st April, 1962, their wage at 173s. for 42 hourswas 11s. 8d. (6-3 per cent.) behind the median rate for a comparable working week. Since 1st April, the median rate has gone still further ahead as a result of increases to other industries, and the railwayman is now 17s. 9d. (or 9-3 per cent.)behind the median. To restore the relativity established by Guillebaud, the railwaymen would have to get an increase of some 16s. weekly (or 9-3 per cent.).Even to restore the relativity established at 1st April, 1962, the railwaymen wouldhave to get an increase of some 5s. 9d. weekly (or 3-3 per cent, of their present rate).
E. M.Ministry of Transport,10th September, 1962.6. Ministry of Labour Indices. The following are the recent increases inrelevant indices : --Increase since Increase since4th January, 1960 1st April, 1962Per cent. Per cent.Index of hourly wage rates (all industries) ... .(to 31st July, 1962)     ...      ...      ... 15-8 ..     L9Index of weekly wage rates (all industries)(to 31st July, 1962) :   ......... 10-8 A-9Retail price index (the latest publishedfigure as for July 1962 and the Augustfigure is likely to be less than this)  ... 9-6 0-67. Dr. Beeching&apos;s Views. Dr. Beeching said at a preliminary discussion with ministers on 4th September that he thought he could avoid the award of a further increase in 1962, but that any increase effective from, say, 1st January, 1963, wouldhave to be not less than 5 per cent, to secure Union acceptance.8. The Cost of a 5 per cent. Increase. A 5 per cent, increase to railwaysalaried and conciliation staff would cost  14 million per annum. The cost of purely railway consequentials might be about  4 million, of which by far the mostimportant would be railway workshops at  3-5 million. (There will be otheralmost inevitable consequentials within the nationalised transport field, costing about another  2 million.)9. The addition of about  18 million to the railway wage bill must be a matter for concern in the context of the current railway deficit. The railway workingdeficit in 1961 was  86-9 million (the overall deficit was  151 million). If lossescontinue at the rate of the first 32 weeks of 1962, the working deficit for 1962 willbe over  90 million. The Vote Estimate for 1962-63 is based on an expectedworking deficit of  90 million and an overall railway deficit of  160 million.Increases in fares and charges might contribute a very little towards meeting thecost of a wage increase. Fares were increased this year and the rise should resultin an increase in revenue of some  6 million per annum to British Railways. Butthe Railway Regions have expressed doubts as to the possibility of raising muchmore from this source. Freight rates are already almost all negotiated individually and the only direction in which a general increase in rates could bring perhaps a modest increase in revenue is parcels and smalls. In the longer term, however,the outlook is more encouraging. The new management is actively engaged in measures to improve productivity and a more effective commercial approach should bring more revenue from freight traffic. There will also be staff reductions. The 18 million which would be the cost of a 5 per cent, increase to railwaymenincluding workshops is about equal to the pay for a full year of 25,000 staff, and could therefore be recouped by a staff reduction of this amount.10. Timing. It is desirable that the Government attitude to the Railwaypay claim should be decided before the second meeting of the Railway Staff national council in the second or third week of October, when the Commission will haveto reply to the Unions.
