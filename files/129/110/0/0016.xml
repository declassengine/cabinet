LEONARDO CARTOONMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasuryir-Qd Faymaster.,Gejpera 1The Cabinet, at their meeting on 19th July, invited me tonegotiate with the National Gallery, the National Art-Collections fund and the Royal Academy   with the object of securing the LeonardoCartoon for the nation at a direct cost to the Exchequer not exceeding 250, 000 (C. C. (62) 48th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.      I have since held discussions with the Chairman and Directorof the National Gallery and also with Lord Crawford and Mr. Babington-Smith, representing the National Art-Collections Fund.   The cabinet recognised that it did not appear that there would be anything to be gained by bringing further pressure on the Royal Academy.   I have therefore not done so,3.      The National Gallery Trustees are unalterably opposed to anyfurther inroad on their annual purchase grants as a means of financing the purchase of the Leonardo Cartoon;  they have already contributed 50, 000.   They have expressed themselves so strongly on this matter that it is in my view clearly impracticable to press them further on it.Although the Trustees have also expressed their distaste for what theyhave described as &quot;a loan to be amortised by a turn-stile&quot;, they have said that &quot;if this is the only means whereby the Government of agreat coLxntry can preserve for itself one of the greatest masterpiecesof all time, we are not prepared to stand in the way&quot;.    In other words, they would acquiesce with illgrace in such an arrangementif the Government were to insist upon it.4.      The Cabinet have not felt able hitherto to contemplate anoutright contribution of more than  250, 000 towards the purchaseof the Cartoon.   As mentioned in paragraph 5 below, the sum by whichthe Appeal is now likely to fall short of the Academy&apos;s   price of 800, 000 is  350, 000.   The gap therefore between a government contribution of  250, 000 and this sum of  350, 000 would be  100, 000,and this would be the sum   which would have to be provided on a repay-ment basis.   It is difficult to foresee how speedily such a sum might be repaid.   If, for the sake of argument, 200, 000 paying visitors were tosee the Carton each year at  2s. a head it would take five years to repay it in full, making ho allowance for administrative costs.   Theadoption of such an arrangement would clearly make it difficult to meetthe Cabinet&apos;s view that the Cartoon, after it had been acquired, oughtC. (62) .116 COPY NO. .JT2L26th July, 1962CABINET
to be withheld from public exhibition for some time in order to minimise the risk that it would be damaged or stolen.   On the otherhand, the case for withholding it from early public exhibitionwould, I think, be weakened if it were to be a question of exhibitingit by itself and with the protection of a turn-stile.5.      Lord Crawford, on behalf of the National Art-Collections Fund,has pressed me strongly for the earliest possible clear decision by theGovernment on the question of a grant to the Appeal Fund;   I d^.d notmention to him the possibility of a grant combined with a loan.Lord Crawford told me definitely that if, for example, the Governmentcould now see their way to making a contribution to the Fund of as muchas  350, 000, then the National Art-Collections Fund would guarantee to find in full the balance required to bring the total sum up to 800, 000.   His present estimate of the total proceeds of the appeal is  410,000 to  415,000.6.      The choice before the Government now appears to me to bea straight one between two courses.   Either  we can insist on theNational Gallery Trustees accepting part of the remaining sum requiredto buy the Cartoon on a repayment ba sis.     In that event the Govern-ment could restrict their outright contribution to  250,000 (or possibly less).   Or the Government could now inform Lord crawford and announce publicly that they will make an outright grant of thefull sum   of  350, 000 towards the purchase of the Cartoon.7.      The case of the Leonardo Cartoon has raised in an acute formthe question whether it is right that public or semi-public bodies in possession of major national treasures should continue to be free to put them up for sale on the international market with the likelyconsequence that they will have to be allowed to leave the country ifthey are not acquired for the nation at great cost.   Lord Robbins,who served as a member of the Waverley Committee and subsequentlyas Chairman of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of art, expressed grave doubts on this score during the course of myrecent discussion with him.   I would propose to arrange for thisquestion to be re-examined fully v/ith the help of the ReviewingCommittee, and to include an intimation to this effect in theannouncement of the   Governments decision in the Leonardo case.8.      I now invite the Cabinet to choose between the alternative courses set out in paragraph 6 above.J.A. B-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.25th July, 1962-2-
