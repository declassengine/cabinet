THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1962C. (62) 121 Copy No.   g Q27th July, 1962CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE INVESTMENT, 1963-64Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general in his statement in Parliament on 27th February, 1962, announcing theGovernments inability to contain the Estimates for 1962-63 within the limitsundertaken in July 1961, the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to public service investment in the following terms:&quot; In the current financial year, public service investment will haveincreased by about 13 per cent. In 1962-63, as the White Paper. publishedlast October showed, this expenditure is planned to increase by 6 per cent.We are working to plans which are based on holding the aggregate rate of increase in 1963-64 at the same percentage increase. I believe that this isof the greatest importance.&quot; (Hansard, Fifth Series, Volume 654, column1137.) /2. The purpose of this statement, which of course followed the precedingCabinet decisions, was, as I understand it, to provide an assurance that this important element of public expenditure was under effective control^ and wasbeing planned on a scale consistent with the capacity of our resources.3. It is now necessary, according to the customary time-table, to take final decisions on public service investment expenditure in 1963-64. Since thepreliminary decisions in February, the previous Ministers for Housing and LocalGovernment and Education, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland had put forward proposals for increases in this expenditure. Nearly allthe figures have been revised since February, to take account of changes in prices and estimated rates of completion, etc., but only the increases mentioned abovereflected proposed changes in policy. If all the proposals made were accepted,the increase in 1963-64 compared with 1962-63 would have been around 11^ percent., compared with the 6 per cent, announced in February.Increases of programme. An increase of this size was clearly unacceptable, both on its own merits,and politically in relation to the February announcement. My predecessor hadbeen conducting discussions with the Ministers concerned in order to reduce theincrease to more manageable dimensions. I have now completed these discussions,with the results set out in the attached table, and described for the salient cases in the following paragraphs.5. Housing. Increase in the Ministry&apos;s approvals for local authority housingfrom 100,000 in 1962 and 105,000 in 1963 to 108,000 and 115,000 respectively, whichwould be consistent with the aim in the Cabinet discussion of increasing the
The Effect of this Increase12. If we do this, we are authorising about  65 million of additionalquick-moving building work (mainly by local authorities) to start within the next18 months or so. This is a large expansion operation, probably not far short ofthe biggest that could in practice be done in public service investment within thisperiod of time. It will give a considerable fillip to the building industry. I hopethe Minister of Education and the Minister of Housing will do their utmost toavoid allocating to places where this would overload the industry.13. If we do this, we are of course reducing correspondingly the room for manoeuvre in next years and the 1964 Budget. My predecessor^ paper C. (62) 117shows the growing problem ahead. The. increase in public service investment doesnot involve substantial immediate expenditure on Votes. But its call on resourcesis very germane to the Budget possibilities.14. Flowever, given the need for action on housing (which represents about two-thirds of the total additions), I am prepared to recommend this programme.But I am sure that it is as far as we can reasonably go.Presentation15. We shall need to consider how to present this. The figures (i.e., the9-J- per cent.) will not be published until October or November. The localauthorities, on the other hand, are bound to see that they are getting authorisationsmore easily, for housing, educational minor works, and general local governmentloan sanctions.16. In my view, the right course is; to refrain from publicising this action atthis stage; leaving ourselves free later on to explain our exceeding the 6 per cent,limit either by the desirability of timely action to stimulate the economy or bythe overriding urgency of the housing problem or both.programme to an annual rate of 120-125,000 over the next two or three years(C.C. (62) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2). A corresponding increase for scotland is included. I read the Cabinet discussion as indicating that a special priority for housing should be given.6. Education. An increase in minor works in England and Wales to be started in 1962-63 and 1963-64 above the low levels decided upon in July 1961 andanj increase in youth service starts in 1963-64 corresponding to that for 1962-63announced by the previous Chancellor in his statement on the Wolfenden reports few weeks ago. Corresponding increases are provided for Scotland. There isstill an outstanding question of whether there should be an immediate further expansion of teacher training facilities: I have agreed that if the Minister ofEducation decides to propose this, and if the proposal is accepted, I should beprepared to add the relatively small 1963-64 investment component of this to whatever aggregate is now agreed (the issue primarily involves expenditure in later years, both capital and current).7.   Home Office. Increases mainly for speeding up building approved schools and remand homes.8.   Miscellaneous Local Government. An increase in the level of loansanctions, involving such projects as swimming baths, refuse disposal, etc.The Aggregate Increase9. The effect is that the current year&apos;s public service investment is likely tobe about 3J per cent, higher in volume than we announced last October (andsomething over 10 per cent, higher in volume than the actual level of 1961-62).10.   The aggregate for 1963-64 would be  94 million, or nearly 9\ per cent.,above that of 1962-63, compared with the 6 per cent, announced in February.11.  Thus, the whole level for the two years 1962-63 and 1963-64 would bevery substantially higher than previously announced.
Conclusion17.   I therefore recommend:(i) endorsement of the 1963-64 public service investment figures set outin the Annex, for publication as usual in October /November;(ii) no publicity at this stage.18. It will be necessary in the autumn to decide our public service investment plans for 1964-65, 1965-66 and 1966-67, in relation to our othermedium-term decisions on public expenditure, particularly defence, education(i.e., general grant for 1963-64 and 1964-65), health, pensions, etc. These will undoubtedly be very difficult decisions.J.
