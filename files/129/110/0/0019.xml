Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C (62) 119 Copy No.16th July, 1962CABINETSERVICE LANDS BRANCHESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury andPaymastfr general there is a long-standing dispute between the Treasury on the one hand and theService Departments on the other about the allocation of responsibility for the workof valuation and negotiation in connexion with the sale and purchase of land by thelatter Departments. The Service Departments maintain that, in the interests of administrative efficiency, the functions should continue to be discharged, as atpresent, by the professional valuation staffs who are members of their respectiveLands Branches. The Treasury maintain that, in the interests of economy andwithout detriment to efficiency, they should be transferred to the Valuation Officeof the Board of Inland Revenue.2. The Treasury&apos;s case is based on considerations of the most efficientdischarge of a specialised professional responsibility and the most economical useof a limited body of skilled manpower. The District Valuer possesses details ofevery transaction in land: he is required to negotiate the great bulk of acquisitionsand disposals by public authorities: and he has the responsibility of making allvaluations for Estate Duty. Moreover, he is well informed about the currentattitudes of local authorities in planning cases; and these have an important influence on values in the light of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1959. That Actintroduced a new &quot; market value &quot; basis of valuation which not only requires anexact knowledge of the local market but also involves, in some cases, questions ofthe practice of local authorities in granting planning permission and even, on occasion, considerations of what action a local authority might have seen fit to take if the land in question had not been acquired by a Department.3. In the circumstances it is almost self-evident that centralisation of specialised expertise should promote its more effective use. Equally, from the pointof view of economy in the use of manpower, the unification of a common service should mean that changes in the load on individual Departments as a result ofadjustments of policy or transfers of function could be met without causing problemsof expansion, redundancy or transfer in separate valuation staffs. The ValuationOffice are already hard pressed to obtain the experienced staff whom they require;and, although they might be able to take over the valuation work of the service departments with no increase in staff, they could with advantage absorb membersof the valuation staffs of those Departments whom it might be found convenient to transfer. In terms of genuine economy in the use of skilled manpowercentralisation would have clear benefits.4. The divergence of view between the Treasury and the Service deparment is now nearly half a century old. The Treasury view has been endorsed by successiveenquiries, from the Howard Frank Committee of 1922 to the Fourth Report of theSelect Committee on EstimateSj 1957-58. The Service Departments, however,have consistently felt unable to envisage the possibility of any transfer of functions.5. In a final attempt to resolve the deadlock it was recently arranged, with theconsent of the Service Ministers and with the approval of the Prime Minister, thatthe issue should be examined by yet another independent body. For this purpose
it was remitted to a committee consisting of Sir Philip Warter, in the Chair;Sir Edward Gillett, one of the Commissioners of the Crown Estates and a past-President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors; and Mr. Michael Rowe,Q.C., who has been Deputy Chairman of the Local Government Commission for england and is the editor of an authoritative work on rating.6. I attach the unanimous report which this committee presented in December1961. It unreservedly supports the Treasury view. It has been examined by theService Departments, who find themselves still unable to accept its clear and decisiverecommendation that &quot; the work of valuation and negotiation of all purchases and sales by the Service Departments should be transferred to the Valuation Office fromthe Lands Branches &quot;.7. In these circumstances I have no choice but to invite my colleagues to reach a collective decision on this issue. It has obstinately defied solution for more than40 years; and this may well be thought to be discreditable in terms of administrativeefficiency, to say nothing of the implied disrespect to the repeated views of select committees which have examined the problem.8. Either we are in earnest in our search for administrative economies or weare not. Here is a test case.H. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,13th July, 1962.

REPORT OF A COMMITTEE ON THE VALUATION and negotiation OF TRANSACTIONS IN LANDS OF THESERVICE departments to We were appointed by the Treasury in September , 1961&apos;, under thefollowing terms of reference&quot;To consider on the basis of the evidence provided for them, andsuch other evidence as they may wish to obtain, whether the valuation and negotiation work of the War Office and the AirMinistry in respect of the sale and purchase of land should be handled as at present by their existing professional valuationstaffs or by the Valuation Office of the Board of Inland Revenuesand to make recommendations o &quot;2.1&apos;      We have read the written evidence which was provided  or us.It comprisesFourth Report from the Select Committee on Estimates ,Session 1957-58.    Lands Branches of the Service Departments.This included, as Appendix 8, the Report of theHoward Frank Committees which in 1922 considered thismatterp with others, under considerably wider terms ofTeferen.ee.House&apos; of ;Commons, Paper dated 18th March, 1959. - Observationsby Ministers on Recommendations of the Select Committee.Arrangements for Purchase and Sale of land by service departments.    Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,prepared in 1959?Arrangements&apos; for Purchase and Sale of land by &quot;service departments.    Memorandum by the Secretaries of State for Warand Air, prepared in 1959*Memoranda by the War Office (of 9th Octobers&apos; 1961&apos;)&apos; and theAir Ministry (of 29th Septembers. 1961) which brought up-to-date the factual information provided in the written evidence to theSelect Committee on Estimates,A memorandum by the Board of Inland Revenue on ValuationOffices in England and Scotlandp dated 4th October, 1961.A memorandum by the Admiralty, - of 28th September, 1961. .3.       We.have had meetings with the Permanent Secretaries and seniorprofessional officers of the War Offices the Air Ministry and the Boardof Inland Revenue, and with representatives of the Treasury.     TheInstitution of Professional Civil Servants asked to present evidence butlater decided not to do so.4.       As the written evidence reveals, this subject has been analysedand debated at intervals over the last forty years.     The major changein the facts during these years has been the growth of the ValuationOffice.     Particularly since the last war the width and complexity of itsfield of operations have very greatly increased.     We accept that the professional material in the Lands Branches of the Service departments 
is as good as that of the Valuation Office and we accept too that, valuationnot being an exact science, even the best valuers make mistakes .    Butwidth of experience backed by an unrivalled store of information as toactual market transactions, as well as settlements for probate, compensa-tion on compulsory acquisition and other forms of valuation must countand in these respects District Valuers are far better placed than the professional staff of any of the Lands Branches.    Further we think thatthe wider scope of work and the better scales of pay offered by the valuation Office may make it increasingly difficult for the Lands Branchesto get the best material seeking employment in valuation work under theCrown.    Subject to these observations we think it unnecessary to repeat the attitudes and arguments of the Departments concerned.    They were quite shortly summarised in the Memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretaries of State for War and Air.    We thereforeset out our conclusions in the next paragraph as concisely as possible but we append to this report the latest information as to the numbers andgrades of staff in the Lands Branches of the Service Departments and inthe Valuation Office and as to the volume of transactions in which theyhave been engaged in recent years or expect to undertake in the nearfuture,5,,       Our conclusions aret-(1)   The Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue Department is themost efficient agency at the country&apos;s disposal for the negotiation of purchases and sales of land by the service departments.(2)   The work of valuation and negotiation of all purchas 6s and salesby the Service Departments should be transferred to the valuation Office from the Lands Branches.     We consider it only sensible that the negotiation of major leases to or fromthe Crown, i.e. those in which the term exceeds seven years or the net rent exceeds  1 ,000 per annum or such figure asthe Treasury may consider suitable on reviewing the situation,,. should also be transferred.    Minor leases and the hiring of married quarters should in general be left with the LandsBranches,(3)   The Lands Branches would continue to manage the Services11Estates, a function which requires a knowledge of service requirements and of practical estate management in which only a very general appreciation of values is necessary-It is for the Service Authorities to determine the areas ofland to be bought or sold and a knowledge of service require-ments is no doubt of importance at this stage but such detailedknowledge is not needed at the later stages of negotiation and determination of price.(4)  A professionally qualified man should remain at the head of eachLands Branch supported by a fairly small number of professionallyqualified assistants most of whom could be qualified in branchesof surveying other than valuation.    Apart from these we think thestaff of the Lands Branches&apos; both at Headquarters and in theCommands or Works Areas could be mainly technical.    If thissuggestion is put into effect, a considerable reduction in the&apos;2
professional establishment of the Lands Branches and therefore a considerable saving in administrative costs should result.(5)   The Valuation Office have vacancies for suitable qualifiedvaluers.    We would hope therefore that the professional staffof the Lands Branches who might become redundant under (4)above could be transferred to the Valuation Office without detriment to their present status or financial position and withan equal chance with existing staff to make their way in a widerorganisation,,(6)   We do not consider that the possibility that a District Valuermay find himself acting for both parties (e. g. on transactionsbetween Service Departments and Local Authorities) is likelyto cause serious embarrassment provided it is made clear tothe Local Authority at the outset that it is at liberty to employanother surveyor and to submit the case to the Lands Tribunalin the last resort.(7)   The instruction and briefing of the Valuation Office by theService Departments should in practice present no moredifficulty than has been found by other departments whichemploy the Valuation Office or is found by the service departments themselves when they brief their own LandsBranches or when these in turn brief Counsel or professionalwitnesses to present their case to the Lands Tribunal.(8)   Treasury sanction to the prices at which Service Departmentsland transactions are concluded should in future only berequired in cases which because of-the large amount of money-   involved (the limit to be specified by the Treasury) or otherexceptional circumstances raise issues other than valuationsimpliciter which should be left to the District Valuer.(9)   In recent years the Valuation Office has from time to timeseconded officers for service overseas 8 in the employmentusually of Colonial Governments.    In very much the same waythe Headquarters Lands Branches of the Service Departments-have seconded, officers to overseas Lands Branches, these officers being responsible to the Area Commander-in-Chie and only very rarely subject to any control or direction from home.    We think that there would be no difficulty in the valuation Office extending its service by seconding officers to serve as Chief Officers to the Lands Branches of overseasCommands.    Such officers would serve a normal period of duty and would be responsible to the Command as at present.(10)   We believe that the transfer we propose is in the publicinterest and would not only secure the best standard ofvaluations but also result in a much more profitable and efficient deployment of the available professional manpower.P.
