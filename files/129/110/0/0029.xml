Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 12927th July, 1962CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME, 1962-63Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Cabinet agreed on 19th July (C.C. (62) 48th Conclusions, Minute 2) thatthe &quot; main programme &quot; Bills next Session should be London GovernmentSafety, Health and Welfare in Shops, Offices and Railway PremisesEducation (Scotland)Weights and MeasuresTelevisionWater Conservation2. The Future Legislation Committee have now considered further, inconsultation with the appropriate Ministers, what place should be given to thefollowing Bills (their present position and approximate size are indicated In brackets):Children and Young Persons and Employment of Children (List B.2:60-70 clauses)Airports Authority (List B.2: 16 clauses)Public Libraries (List C: 30 clauses)Administration of Justice (Funds in Court) (List C: 25 clauses moreif the Bill deals also with legal aid in civil cases)Companies (Deposits) (List C: 30 clauses)Underground Parking (List C: 3 clauses)Severn Bridge Tolls (List D: 6 clauses)Commonwealth Scholarships (Amendment) (List D: 2 clauses)Commonwealth Development Corporation (not listed: 4 clauses)The Committee have also given some preliminary consideration to the questionwhether the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, now in List B.2, should be limited toprovisions needed to enable legal aid to be given in criminal cases.3. Bearing in mind the importance in the coming Session of having an attractive programme and of not over-burdening Parliament with legislativebusiness, I do not feel that I could recommend the addition to the main programmeof more than two of the bigger Bills listed in the preceding paragraph. It was thegeneral view that the Children and Young Persons Bill would be the most suitableBill to advance and after discussion it seems to me that the choice for a second place lies between Administration of Justice (Funds in Court) and Companies(Deposits). Important as they are for administrative reasons, Airports authority and Public Libraries would not have the political impact which is especiallydesirable in what may be the last Session of the present Parliament.4. Of the smaller Bills listed in paragraph 2, it appears that Severn BridgeTolls can wait until 1963-64 and that means can be found of securing the copy No.
Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, S.W-1,27th July, 1962.Commonwealth Scholarships (Amendment) Bill and the commonwealth development Corporation Bill the first by making no demand on Governmentlegislative time and the second by including the requisite provisions in the colonial development and Welfare (Amendment) Bill, which already has a place in the contingent list. The remaining short Bill is Underground Parking. This wouldprobably be attractive to London motorists but it would involve the closure of horse Guards Parade for a year and might attract a good deal of criticism inParliament. My own feeling is that it would be inexpedient to include it in theprogramme.^* ^5. There is. a special problem which I should like to examine further with1the Secretary of State for Scotland about the Scottish Bills whose Second Readingwould normally be taken in the Scottish Grand Committee. The LocalGovernment Finance (Scotland) Bill, in the &quot; essential &quot; list, will be controversialthough not very long (probably 12 clauses); the Electricity (Borrowing) (Scotland)Bill (contingent) will be short and possibly controversial, and the Education(Scotland) Bill (in the main programme) is short and uncontroversial. the criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill as originally intended would be of considerablelength: the most urgent part of it would provide for legal aid in the Scottishcriminal courts and it is for consideration whether the Bill should be confined tothat subject. There has been a suggestion that some provisions for legal aid inthe English civil courts might be combined either with a full-scale Scottish measureor with one limited to legal aid in criminal cases. Any such combination would,however, have the effect that time on the floor of the House would certainly be needed.6.   I recommend (a) that the Children and Young Persons Bill should now be added to the list of main programme Bills set out in paragraph 1 of this paper;(b) that there should also be added to that list either the Administration ofJustice (Funds in Court) Bill or the Companies (Deposits) Bill. my own preference would be for the latter;(c) that, subject to consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, themain programme should include a Bill consisting either of the mainScottish criminal justice provisions plus legal aid or of legal aidprovisions alone;(d) that the Commonwealth Scholarships (Amendment) Bill should be draftedwith a view to obtaining it without demand being made on thelegislative time normally available to the Government;(e) that provisions to extend the scope of the Colonial development corporation should be included in the Colonial Development and welfare (Amendment) Bill now in the contingent list;(/) that we should not proceed in the coming Session with these Bills Airports AuthorityPublic LibrariesUnderground ParkingSevern Bridge TollsThere would, of course, be the traditional phrase in The Queen&apos;sSpeech &quot; Other measures will be laid before you in due course &quot; andthese Bills can be reconsidered in the unlikely event of other measurestaking less Parliamentary time than I at present expect.I.
