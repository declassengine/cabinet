housing memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-GeneralThe Minister of Housing and Local Government, in his paper c. (62) 145, raises a large number of important points which, as he says, will require working out with the Departments concerned.    Atthis stage the only point on which I wish to comment is his proposalto increase the total level of house-building to 350, 000 a year.2.        The total (Great britain, public and private) has recentlybeen just over 300, 000 a year;  the additional allocation of resources to housing would be of the order of  110 million a year.3.        We must consider the factors involved in becoming committed to an objective, the implementation of which is outside our control(about 60 per cent of house-building is private).4.        The question is whether we afford to devote such substantially increased resources to housing, given the other prospective claimsupon the national resources.     We cannot decide in favour of housingwithout in effect deciding the competing claims too,5.        This must be considered first in relation to the prospectiveresources of and demands upon the construction industries.    new housing is well over one-third of this, and new housing plus other public sector work represent well over 60 per cent.     There is muchto be done to foster increased productivity, but we must take a realistic long-term view on how much we can really count on;  andcompare this with the prospective claims.6.        The Minister of Public Building and &quot;Works and I have been considering how we could act most effectively together to keep thedemands on the construction industries in step with the prospectiveresources;  and this review of the prospect over the next four or fiveyears is the most urgent thing to do.    Until it is.done it is difficultto decide on a long-term objective for housing, or for the other out-standing building programmes.7,        But the demand on the construction industries is only one aspect of the competition between housing and other things for a share in the growing national output.    There are all the other publicprogrammes, current and capital, clamouring for a share of the increasing resources - defence, education, health, roads, pensions,etc.    There is wide agreement that private investment needs more-1-C.

resources (to press forward growth) and exports need more:  and atthe end of the chain is the question of the extent to which we shall beable to allow private consumption to expand.    We know that, lookingfour years ahead, the claims exceed the growth of resources on whichit is permissible to count.8. In the next few weeks, we shall have to decide:-(i)    the education and other public service investment expenditure (besides housing) for 1964-65 and1965-66 - it is necessary to authorise now startsin 1963-64 and these determine the expendituretwo years later;(ii)    a proposal for a large increase in the electricityprogramme;(iii)    the size of the general grant to the local authorities for 1963-64 and 1964-65 - in effect the rate of growth of local authorities&apos; educational and other relevant expenditure on which the Governmentare prepared to base the grant;(iv)    we shall also shortly have to take decisions on national Insurance pensions and assistance.9.        The decision on the long-term housing objective must be apart of this series of decisions, which will in effect settle ourpriorities.10.       I propose therefore:-(i)    that the Minister of Public Building and Works andI should make a review of prospective demands and resources on the construction industries forthe period to 1966;(ii)    that the decision on the 350,000 housing proposalbe deferred until the review in (i) is available anduntil the Cabinet have before them the other major issues for decision in paragraph 8.    Itis my intention to bring all of these forward as quickly as possible.J. A. B. -C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.1st October, 1962.
