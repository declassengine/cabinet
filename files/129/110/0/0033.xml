LETTER FROM MINISTERS OF THE FEDERATION AND ADENTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESWe, Ministers of the Federation of South Araibia and Ministers of aden, have, over a period of months, held meetings together in Aden todiscuss the future relationship between Aden and the Federation.The inhabitants of Aden and of the Federation are predominantly of arab race and Muslim religion. They share a common language andregard themselves as one people. The port of Aden is the main outlet forthe surrounding territories, which form its hinterland; and the economic interests of both are closely inter-woven. For these reasons Aden and theFederation belong essentially together.We are accordingiy convinced that the ending of the unnatural division between them, which is due to the accident of history, would be in the true interests of all who live in this area, and would contribute greatly totheir prosperity and safety. Moreover, we trust that, by increasing their economic strength and political stability, the union between Aden and theFederation would bring nearer the achievement of full independence, towhich we attach the highest importance.We therefore earnestly request the British Government to give favour-able consideration to the enitry of Aden into the Federation.We recognise that Aden has developed political and social institutionsdifferent from those of the rest of the Federation, and occupies a positionof outstanding commercial importance. For these and other reasons, weoonsdder that Aden would be entitled, in certain respects, to special txeat-ment, including larger representation in the Federation than has been accorded to the existing Member States.It was made clear to us by the British Government that any proposals we might wish to make should not affect British sovereignty over Adenor the Governors reserved powers. We appreciate that, in view of the strategic significance of Aden, Britain requires the fullest safeguards for theunfettered operation of her defence installations, which are essential for thedischarge of hex world-wide responsibilities as well as for the protectionof the inhabitants of this area.In addition, we are agreed that, on the occasion of its entry into theFederation, a further measure of constitutional advance in Aden would be appropriate.With these considerations in mind, we worked out together in Adena draft scheme, which we have now finalised after consultation with you.Our agreed recommendations are contained in the following documentsannexed hereto ;(a) Draft Treaty between the Government of the United Kingdom andthe Government of the Federation of South Arabia providing for the accession of Aden to the Federation.(b) Proposals for the amendment of the Constitution of the federation and its application to Aden.(c) Proposals for constitutional advance in Aden, and for the adoptionof a code of human rights.

Provisions (a) and (b) should be broughtinto effect immediately. In order to coincide with the other administrativechanges which will be necessitated by Aden&apos;s entry into the Federation, theother provisions should be brought into effect on the date of accession.Title of the GovernorAs from the date of Aden&apos;s accession to the Federation, the title of theGovernor should be changed to that of &quot; High Commissioner&quot; in respect ofall his functions both in the Federation and in Aden. This change of titlewould not affect in any way the Governor^ powers.
Proposals regarding responsibility for Internal Security in AdenSubject and without prejudice to the powers of the Governor, internal security in Aden should, after Aden&apos;s entry into the Federation, be a Federal responsi-bility. The terms on which that responsibility would be exercised by the federal government in Aden should, subject always to the retention by the Governor ofthe powers mentioned above, be as follows :(1) The Federation^ powers in Aden should be delegated to the Governmentof Aden in the same way and to the same extent as the States now inthe Federation have been granted powers in respect of internal securityby delegation from the Federation.(2) The Aden Armed Police should be transferred to the Federation andshould be provided for in the Federal Estimates, but should not be liable for service outside Aden in the Federation.(3) The Federal Supreme Council should delegate its powers in respect ofthe Aden Armed Police to the Government of Aden, to the same extent as its powers are delegated to the Federal States in the case of theSecond Federal Guard, and should not resume such delegated powerswithout the consent of the Governor, nor should the Federal supreme council within a period of two years from the date of Aden entering the Federation seek the oonsent ,of the Governor for such powers to be resumed.(4) The Aden Civil Police should remain a responsibility of Aden andshould be provided for in the Aden Estimates, and should not be liableto serve outside Aden, but at the end of a period of three years fromthe date of Aden entering the Federation the question whether the AdenCivil Police shall remain with Aden or be transferred to the federation should be reviewed. Simultaneously the position of State civil police forces as a whole should also be reviewed.
Proposals regarding Administration, Government Staff and FinanceA dministration1. A number of Working Parties have been set up in Aden to advise uponthe arrangements required for the transfer of administrative responsibilities and departmental services, on Aden&apos;s accession to the Federation. It is proposed toproceed on the general lines they have recommended.Government Staff2. It is recommended that all officials designated under the Overseas ServiceAid Scheme who are at present serving either in Aden or in the federation should be placed, by Order in Council, at the disposal of the Governor, whowould make them available as required for service with the Federal or AdenState Governments.3. On other staff maltters, and in particular in regard to locally engaged staff,it would be the intention of the Federal and Aden Governments to deal withthese matters on the general lines recommended in the Ramage Report, whichis shortly to be published in Aden. But the Aden and Federal governments would not propose to make any final decisions until they had consulted withthe representatives of those affected.4. It is recommended that advisory Public Service Commissions should beestablished to advise the Federal Government and the Governor on publicservice matters.5. It is recommended that the Governments of the Federation and Aden should,as soon as possible, formulate a common policy regarding the Arabisation ofthe Public Service, on the basis of definitions to be established by a jointCommittee.Finance6. It is recommended that the financial and fiscal arrangements of the Federa-tion should be based in general on the Pearl Report which is shortly to bepublished in Aden.7. In order to enable trade to move freely throughout the Federation andto provide the Federal Government with a source of revenue, it is recommendedthat customs and excise should become the exclusive responsibility of theFederation. To compensate the Member States, other tihian Aden, for the lossof revenue involved, the Federal Government should pay them annual sumsbased on the revenue they derived from these sources during the year 1961-62,as calculated by a Commission to be set up for this purpose.8. On the basis of the Pearl Report, it is recommended that certain revenuesources and expenditure should be transferred from the Aden budget to theFederation budget. This arrangement would involve an annual balancing pay-ment to Aden from the Federation, fixed in advance for the first three years.This should be reviewed after three years ; but it is proposed that Aden shouldnot be required to pay to the Federation the sum of  100,000, as recommended

REPLY FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies to MINISTERS&apos; OF THE FEDERATION AND ADENI wish to thank you for your letter of August 16th, 1962.The British Government: have always recognised that the peoples of:Aden and: of the: neighbouring States: are linked together by strong ties of: blood and faith and that their economies: are-essentially complementary.That is why, ever; since the Federation was formed in 1959, it: has beenour hope that, in due course, Aden would join it. I am therefore glad to know that both your Governments share this view and consider thatthe time has come for the union to be effected.The constitutional and administrative proposals which you have worked out together, in consultation with the Governor, are acceptable to us ;and I am pleased to inform you that, subject to approval by parliament and by the Legislatures of the Federation and of Aden, the British Govern-ment will, be prepared to conclude a Treaty with the Government of theFederation in the terms proposed.I welcome this opportunity to reaffirm the declared intention of theBritish Government to continue to give to the Federation financial andtechnical assistance in developing its economy and to lead its people assoon as practicable to sovereign independence. In this connection, I am sure you are right in thinking that the added strength which will flow from the accession of Aden will help to advance the time when theFederation will be able to assume the full responsibilities of nationhood.(Signed). Duncan Sandys.16th August, 1962.
APPENDIX-Exchange of Letters Regarding Financial AssistanceLetter from the Secretary of State for The Colonies to ministers of the Federation and AdenIn the discussions between us, Aden Ministers have represented to methat the transitional adjustments which the accession of Aden will entailare likely to involve the Aden Government in additional expenditure.To meet this problem, the British Government are willing to make a specialgrant to Aden of  500,000, payable in instalments over the first three yearsafter Aden&apos;s entry into the Federation.Similarly, Federal Ministers have drawn my attention to the liabilitywhich the Federation will have to assume under the amended constitution for compensating the State Governments for the loss of revenue due to thetransfer of customs duties to the Federation. To assist the Federal Govern-ment in this matter, the British Government propose to pay the Federationa special grant of up to  190,000 in the first year after the accession of Aden.If, on investigation, the liability is found to be higher, we shall be preparedto give the matter further consideration. In subsequent years, we shall take into account the Federation^ liability in this matter when determining our general budgetary assistance to the Government of the Federation.16th August, 1962 (Signed) Duncan Sandys.Reply from Ministers of the Federation and AdenWe acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of August 16th,1962 ; and we wish to express our appreciation for this additional assistance which the British Government propose to provide, in order to ease thefinancial problems arising from the accession of Aden to the Federation.Signed by:  Ministers of the Federationof South ArabiaMuhammad Farid al &apos;Aulaqi(Minister of Finance and Chair-man of Supreme Council).Hussain bin Ahmad al Habili(Minister of the Interior).Ahmad bin &apos;Abdullah al Fadhli(Minister of Agriculture andEconomic Development).Salih bin Hussain al Audhali(Minister of Internal Security).Fadhl bin Ali al &apos;Abdali (Ministerof Defence and Adviser onForeign Affairs).16th August, 1962.Ministers of AdenA.
