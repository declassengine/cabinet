This consists of the text tabled by the Six in July following theinitiative of Senor Colombo, who was then the Chairman of theConference, at the May Ministerial meeting.     Passages which were added during the last Ministerial meeting to strengthen the textfrom the Commonwealth point of view are underlined, and thosedeleted for the same reason are shown in square brackets.E, H.Foreign Office, S.

&quot; ANNEXPaper submitted by the Six to the Committee of deputies on 19th July, 1962 and subsequent deletions(in square brackets) and additions (underlined)during 10th Ministerial meeting on 1st-5th August,1962TEMPERATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTSI.      DEFINITIVE SOLUTIONGENERAL SOLUTION FOR THE LONGER term a.      WORLD-WIDE AGREEMENTS1.     /&quot;First of 8.11^7 the present ^&quot;abnormalJ7 stateof the world agricultural market /^&quot;should be recalled^is abnormal:   trade between the developed countries of the Western world is carried on at prices that donot correspond to the cost price (subsidies);   the bigexporting couitries in the East intervene on markets bymeans of subsidies;   finally, /&quot;a third^7 the rest ofthe world is faced with the problem of undernourish-ment.Further, the drawing up of the common agricultural policy of the Six has introduced a new element intointernational trade (levies).     Although it may beconsidered that /-In-7 with the Community as atpresent composed this new element /&quot;has^? would have  7had comparatively little effect on world trade, the- issame !^f&quot;would-7/no longer ,/&quot;beJ7 true of an enlarged community containing /&quot;Great Britain 7 the UnitedKingdom.     Indeed, the enlarged Community will/constitute....
constitute the most important importing bloc in theworld.     Its wheat imports will amount to approxim-ately half of all world commercial imports;   fordairy produce the figure will amount to two-thirds;for /&quot;beefj7 meat, to three-quarters;   for sugar, toa third.     This /&quot;dominantj7 decisive position in world trade ,/&quot;willJ7 imposes, on the enlarged Communityan increased responsibility /&quot;on the enlarged community^ of which it is aware.All these reasons make better organization of theworld market /&quot;inevitablem7 urgent and essential.It will be necessary, therefore, to reach world-wideagreements for the main agricultural products./Through^/ in the frame work of such agreements, it willbe possible to find a permanent solution for theproblems of exporting countries, including those inthe Commonwealth.2.     With a view to concluding these world-wide agree-ments, the Community should take the initiative of calling, as soon as possible and, if possible in 1963,an international conference in which/S117the principalexporting and importing countries of the products inquestion would be invited to participate.     TheCommunity and the United Kingdom could express their intentions on this subject- in a joint declaration/which....

CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        148CO N FIDE NTIALparticularly in order to meet the /&quot;trencW7 develop-ment of requirements and of outlets in /&quot;variousj?the different   parts of the world.The conference will therefore examine, inter alia, the following subjects:-the price and production policy to he followedby the exporting and importing countries;the minimum and maximum quantities which mustand can enter international traderstock-piling policy, the financing of stocks and what should he done with them;the special aspects of trade with developing countries.The world-wide agreements should he subject to revision every three years and should make provisionfor institutions respnnsible for supervising theirexecution.B.      PRICE POLICY OF THE ENLARGED COMMUNITYSince price policy largely determines the volumeof production and thus the outlet opportunities forexporting countries, the Community&apos;s future price policy is particularly important for all exportingthird countries.     It seems advisable, therefore, thatupon and even before the accession of the UflitedKingdom the Community should make a declaration/expressing.,.

The evolution of these policiescould, in addition, be the subject of consultationswithin the framework of the agreements of more limitedgeographical extent referred to in Chapter III below.This policy, which the enlarged Community intends to pursue, will also offer reasonable opportunities in(1)/Regarding7 As regards cereals, a marked orienta-tion will be given to the price policy of the Communityeven before the accession of the United Kingdom,/because7since the Council is to /draw up7 decide uponthe criteria /which will be adopted to fix/ to be usedin determining the measures to be taken by member states in respect of prices,/its markets...
its markets for exports of temperate agricultural products.     The Community expects that it will be accorded reciprocity.C.     ACCESS TO MARKETSIt should be noted that the agricultural regula-tions adopted by the Community require the abolitionof quantitative restrictions and similar measures affecting trade in general, both between Member Statesand with third countries.     /&quot;Provision is made forj7the application of safeguard clauses is envisaged to cope with serious disturbances.     /&quot;I&quot;t must be added,however, thatJ7   these measures are . by their nature,non-discriminatory.
- 7 .ii. Transitional solution?SOLUTION FOR THE TRANSITIONAL period .    There /would have toJ7 should he a product-by-product examination of the transitional measures/which might prove^/ shown to be necessary for temperateagricultural products.   In the absence of world-wideagreements such as those envisaged in Section 1A above.or of agreements such as those envisaged in Section IIIbelow, such measures would apply for the whole transitional period.2.   /A^7 Referring more particularly to cereals an examination has been made in the case of cereals and it is agreed that the transitional arrangements should beas follows:(a)   the Community would /restate/ reiterate its intention to fix the standard reductions(&quot;abatteraents forfaitaires&quot;) in such a way as notto cause a sudden and /markedJ7 considerablealteration in trade patterns.on the Six /andJ7 would also /affectJZ haveimplications as regards access to Community markets for exports from third countries;(b)   a distinction would be made between products /onJ7for which there is at present a preference in theUnited Kingdom market and those /onJ7 for whichthere is none./Jlowever, in the absence of a world-wideagreement, the proposed arrangement would apply toThis declaration /would apply amongj7 ^bindin9/both

The size of this preference, which would work against them, will be determined largely by theeffect of the intra-Community standard reduction(&quot;abattement forfaitaire&quot;) during the transitional period.In this respect, the Community recalls/The
- 9 -the general declaration under II, 2(a) above and the undertakings already given in the framework of the G.A.T.T.(c)       /Moreover, J if - following the implementation of the common agricultural policy - theapplication of the standard reduction were contraryto the objective defined above to cause a sudden and^arked^7 considerable alteration of trade patternsin the United Kingdom market, /contrary to the objective defined aboveSJ7 the Community undertakes to review the conditions of application of thestandard reduction /toJ7 in the United Kingdom,after consultation with the countries of theCommonwealth.Bo     5(a) /f ILK AND MILK/ DAIRY PRODUCTSAlthough the Community has not yet drawn up regulation for dairy produce, it is to be expected thatthe mechanisms adopted for these products, andespecially for butter, will include the application ofa system of levies.In these circumstances, the measures adopted for the transitional period for certain cereals may also beadopted for dairy /produce^/ products, as also for allthe products to which a levy system would be applied.C. Ml. BEEF AND VEAL MUTTON AND LAMBD. SUGAR FLOURAn examination of the products at (a) and (b)above will be made in the next stsge of the negotiations./^I -f- jC      e o ft
- 10 -inIt /will beJ7 is recalled that the Treaty of Romeincludes Community procedures in the field of thecommon agricultural policy and of /trade^Z commercial policy, based, with effect from the end of the second stage, on the qualified majority rules, which makeit possible to assess the s situation and to act inaccordance with the conclusions drawn from the developmentof world-wide negotiations.- In particular, if it werenot possible to conclude world-wide agreements covering the most important exporting and importing countries, theCommunity would be prepared to consult with a view toconcluding agreements with such of these countries - andespecially those of the Commonwealth - as would /6V7have been prepared to conclude such world-wideagreements on the same basis as the European economic community. -

The UnitedKingdom Government also note, however, that paragraph 5of the Article enables any member State to refer the commissions decision to the Council, which may amend orannul the decision by qualified majority vote.   Inaddition the United Kingdom Government understand that/it is ....
- 12 -it Is only In exceptions .. circumstances that suchquantitative restrictions are likely to be decided:and that in deciding the measures to be taken in theinterest of the Community the Commission would haveregard to relevant circumstances, including the legitimateinterests of third countries.4,   The United Kingdom Government note that paragraph 5of Article 2^ envisages the possibility of the suspension .of import certificates in respect of third countries afterthe end of the transitional period.   It notes, however,that the manner in which effect is to be given to the paragraph is to be determined by the Council on a proposal of the Commission.
