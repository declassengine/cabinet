(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (62) 1127th July, 1962CABINETRESALE PRICE MAINTENANCEMjg^^r^J^gg^bJL.&apos;^.1?, SfrJf^gQfe,.Q*.foe Board o  TradeIt is now some little time since the Cabinet discussed resale price maintenance (C C. (62) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5) and it is desirablethat the Governments intentions should be announced as soon as possible.The further consideration that I have given to this difficult question hasreinforced my view that v/e ought to abolish resale price maintenance.Indeed, I think that we cannot afford not to.   Further, resale price maintenance will not die of itself.COPY NO.    6 IThe e c on or^c^ca^e^foj^b^ilition2.      We must have a fully competitive economy if we are to promoteeconomic growth and stop inflation.   Resale price maintenance is animpediment to the development of a fully competitive economy.   l%erethe practice prevails, price competition between retailers is eliminatedand prices are kept artificially high.   Price-maintained articles account for something like 40 per cent of total consumer expenditure on goods,and cover a wide range.   If resale price maintenance were abolished,retail prices might fall by as much as 5 per cent, representing a saving to the consumer of about  180 million.   Its abolition would alsostimulate price competition between manufacturers, which in turn would benefit the consumer.3. We also cannot afford the claims on our scarce resources oflabour and capital which result from resale price maintenance. Itprotects the inefficient and so ties up labour and capital which couldbe put to better use elsewhere. By abolishing it v/e should facilitate the movement towards more streamlined channels of distribution andthe extension of self-service. Distribution costs would be reduced,and labour saved. (About 14 per cent of the total working population is employed in the distributive trades, and they have been absorbingmanpower at a faster rate than the economy as a whole.)4.      We should not of course see these desirable results overnight,but they would be achieved, and with gathering momentum.   Equally,the abolition of resale price maintenance would not     result in disruptionand disaster in the retail trade;  there would be time for adjustment,as has been shown by the experience of other countries who have pro-hibited the practice, such as Sweden and Canada.-1-SEGRET
The political case for abolition5.     A decision to do nothing about resale price maintenance would,in my opinion, be impossible to justify on economic grounds.   arguments that it makes for higher standards of service or efficient large-scale production, or that it helps the consumer in his shopping, simply donot stand up to examination.   The reason for our doing nothing would beplain to all - that we feared to lose the votes of those who were stronglyattached to resale price maintenance and judged that other people weremostly indifferent on the issue and would not be influenced in theirvoting by a decision either way.   I believe that it is mistaken to thinkthat ordinary people are indifferent.   Young people - especially youngmarrieds - are keenly interested in being able to shop at competitiveprices, as the growing proportion of self-service and discount storesdemonstrates.     Criticism of failure to abolish resale price maintenancewould not in my opinion be confined to economists and the financial press.Properly presented, the case for abolition could have widespread popularappeal.   Resale price maintenance could be shown for what it is - an oldfashioned practice out of keeping with a young and tlirusting community,eager to march with the times;   and, furthermore, an old fashionedpractice which we cannot afford to retain if we are to become a fullyefficient economy.   Moreover, its abolition would confer visible andtangible benefits on the consuming public - practical help to the consumer,in his pocket. (Some additional facts are given in the Annex. )How resale price maintenance should be abolished6.      If we are to secure the maximum benefit, economic and political,we ought to make resale price maintenance Ulegal^and not merely7.      If resale price maintenance were made illegal it would be a statutory offence for a manufacturer to impose a retail price conditionon goods which he supplied to a distributor.   To add to its effectiveness,this should be coupled with a prohibition on the withholding of suppliesby a manufacturer from a retailer who had sold the manufacturer^goods at less than the prices which the manufacturer &quot;suggested&quot;.8.      Provisions of this kind  should lead to the immediate ending ofresale price maintenance.9.      If resale price maintenance were made legally unenforceable butnot illegal the effect would be that a manufacturer could not sue in thecourts a retailer who had ignored a retail price condition in a contract for the supply of goods, whose retail prices the manufacturer wished tomaintain.10.    On the other hand, insofar as the manufacturer was willing and able to sell only to retailers who were prepared to observe his pricesthere would be nothing in the law to stop him,   &quot;Gentlemen&apos;s&quot; agreementscould be made, possibly under duress.   Moreover, there would be nothing to prevent a manufacturer from withholding supplies from aretailer who did not observe any retail price condition which the manufacturer imposed.   We could of course make the withholding of-2-
supplies illegal, but our experience of this provision in Section 24 ofthe 1956 Act, in relation to collective enforcement of resale price maintenance, has been unsatisfactory, because of the difficulty in getting evidence of the purpose of withholding supplies.11.     If resale price maintenance were merely made legally un-enforceable, and not illegal, the practice would not therefore immediately and automatically come to an end over the whole field.12.     Where the manufacturer was in direct contract with, the retailerand particularly where he would normally have only one retail outletin a given area, (e, g. motor cars) he would probably be able to confinehis sales to retailers who would observe his price conditions.   Thefollowing are sold mainly direct by the manufacturer to the retaiiler:motor vehicles, photographic goods, the larger electrical appliances(refrigerators, television sets, etc.), chocolate, confectionery,cigarettes and tobacco and books.   On these goods resale price maintenance practices would be likely to continue, at least for some time if resale price maintenance were made only legally unenforceable.13.     In the case of textiles, the smaller domestic electrical applicancespharmaceutical goods, cosmetics, razor blades, ironmongery, hardwareand stationery, the retailer normally or to a large extent buys hissupplies from a wholesaler.   In these trades it is likely that resale price maintenance practices would disappear over a period, if resale price maintenance conditions were made legally unenforceable.14.    As between the alternatives open to us my own view is that theright course would be to make this practice illegal and not merelylegally unenforceable.   If we adopted the latter Bourse, resale price maintenance would be likely to remain for some considerable time overa large,    and important, part of the field.   There would inevitably be confusion and uncertainty and accusations that our policy was in-consistent end unfair as between industries.   The extent of the price reductions which should follow the ending of resale price maintenancewould be reduced.   Eut if we made it illegal, we should get rid of thepractice outright, over the whole field, and people would know wherethey stood.15.    I recognise that some of my colleagues may feel that the implications-tions of making resale price maintenance illegal present difficulty.It is of course true that we should be making the practice of resale price maintenance a statutory offence, and that consequently, if asupplier made a contract which contained a provision for resale price maintenance, he would run the risk of receiving no payment at all forhis goods and he would be unable to obtain legal redress.   But thesupplier would be inserting a provision for resale price maintenance in the full knowledge that he was breaking the law.   I cannot myselfsee that he deserves any sympathy &apos;- if he breaks the law, he must takethe consequences.-3-SECIRET
Possible provision for exceptions to.the abolition of resale pricem maintenance^nance16.     I have considered whether it would be desirable to provide forexceptions to be made to a genera.! prohibition of resale price maintenance,but my conclusion is that on economic grounds the right and mostdefensible course would be to abolish the practice across the board.Moreover, the only approach which could be embodied in a short bill which could be introduced at an early date is a general prohibitionwith no exceptions.   The controversy would be short and sharp but thereneed be no protracted debate.Re c ommendatlon s17.     I invite the Cabinet to agree that the practice of resale price maintenance should be made illegal and that, in addition, the withholding of supplies by a manufacturer from a retailer by reason of the manu-facturer&apos;s goods having been sold at less than the &quot;suggested&quot; prices,should also be made illegal.F, J , E0iBoard of Trade, 3.

ANNEXSOME ADDITIONAL, FACTS1.   Cavingp on Groceries(a) A survey of prices charged by various types of grocery retailersin Greater London was recently made by Garland-Compton Ltd.an advertising firm.   The survey showed the average prices of brandedgrocery products to be 4. 7 per cent lower than the prices suggestedby manufacturers and it was estimated that the saving to the nationaldomestic grocery bill which has resulted from the breakdown of resale price maintenance is in the region of  65 million in a year.(b) The Chairman of J. Sainsbury, Ltd. said in the Daily Telegraphin February, I960:   &quot;resale price maintenance has virtually been abolished in the retail food trade.   There is no chaos, but stimulatingcompetition to the benefit of the housewife and to more progressive, firm!2. Views of Consumer Organisations(a) In May 1961 the National Council of Women gave the results ofan enquiry circulated to 100 branches:-&quot;Thirty-two branches were in favour of abolishing resale price maintenance and none was in favours of its continuance.   only four of those who favoured abolition were concerned that the smalltrader might suffer as a result,Respondents were also in favour of cut prices and had littleexperience of a deterioration of the quality of cut-price goods&quot;.(b) In June 1961 Consumer&apos;s Association Ltd. conducted a postalsurvey.   Among the findings were the following:-About 75 per cent of the respondents thought that the advertisedstandard price should be no more than a guide to shopkeepers, who should be free to sell below it if they so wished.The majority in favour of the shopkeeper&apos;s freedom to varyprices was greater in the case of goods which are bought regularly(e. g. groceries) or frequently (e. g. , clothes) than in the case of consumer durables which are bought rarely.   For the last class ofgoods nearly a third of the respondents favoured fixed prices.With regard to bargain shopping, more than half the respondents(58 per cent) made a regular practice of looking out for goods markeddown below the manufacturer^ standard price in the course of regularshopping and fewer than one in ten said that they never did.   In thefield of consumer durables, however, some 54 per cent of respondentssaid that they did not look out for marked down goods -when shoppingfor something which would last a long time.-5-
The survey showed a high level of disapproval both for the withholding of supplies and for legal action in defence of resale priceconditions.The survey also indicated that disapproval of resale price maintenance is more general among the younger age groups than witholder people.3. The following countries have abolished resale price maintenance,or restricted its application:CanadaUnited StatesSwedenNorwayDenmarkFrance .4*   Political Views(a) The Federation of University Conservative and UnionistAssociations passed the following motion, with a large majority,at their Annual Conference in April:&quot;That this Conference believes that the present res-restriction on demand for goods in this country isan unsatisfactory way of increasing exports and of promoting economic growth and would prefer tosee resources shaken free for the export drive bydeliberate encouragement of competititon throughmethods such as cutting tariffs, stopping subsidies to &apos;larne dog&apos; industries and abolishing legal sanction for Jhe^g^orceinent of resale price maintenance&quot;.(b) The Liberal Party have consistently opposed resale price maintenance.    In a statement put out in February, 1962,Mr. Grimcnd, M.P. , stated -&quot;... a Government trying to stop inflation which makes itillegal for shops to reduce prices is crazy&quot;.The Liberal candidate at Orpington included the abolition of resale price maintenance in his election address.(c) The Labour Party have supported the abolition of resale price maintenance consistently since 1951.July, 1962-6-SEGRET
