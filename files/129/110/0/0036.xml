(62) 53 Copy No.j A g17th August, 1962CABINETCommon Market Negotiations CommitteeBRITAIN, THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMICCOMMUNITYMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal-introduction the Ministerial meeting in Brussels from lst-5th August can be regarded asmarking the close of the first phase of the negotiations for our entry into theEuropean Economic Community. The second phase will begin in the autumn withthe resumption of negotiations at the official level in September and at the ministerial level in the first days of October. This pause in the negotiationsprovides a convenient opportunity for me to give my colleagues an account of theprogress which has been made to date, and to consider(a) the work which still remains to be done in Brussels, and(b) the handling of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference.2. The paper which has been sent to the Commonwealth has been circulatedseparately. This records the position reached to date on each of the main subjectsdealt with in the Brussels negotiations.3. The negotiations are proving every bit as tough as we expected. the atmosphere throughout has been good and, in spite of a difference with the Frenchduring the final session, the adjournment took place harmoniously. Germany,Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands have all made it clear that they are keen for usto join. The French have never been enthusiastic and they will drive a hardbargain, particularly where their own interests are affected, but in my judgmentthey will be reluctant to accept responsibility for a breakdown in view of the desire of the other countries that we should go in, and of the incalculable results thatwould follow, both for the Community itself and for the Western world as a whole.4. The negotiations have been particularly difficult regarding trade intemperate agricultural products. This stems from the fundamental problem of how to reconcile our need to safeguard the vital interests of Canada, Australia and NewZealand with our acceptance of the common agricultural policy. In those caseswhere this policy has been agreed upon by the Six often with the greatest difficulty our need to safeguard the Commonwealth tends to force us to disturbthe delicate balance between conflicting interests which has already been achieved.In the cases where the common agricultural policy has not yet been agreed, wehave to face the desire of individual countries to protect their own domestic producers. We have always recognised that, left to themselves, the Six might develop into an inward-looking and largely self-sufficient bloc. In my view, basedon experience in the negotiations, this is a very real danger. Because of the size and importance of the Community, this could constitute quite apart from thepolitical implications a serious threat to the future development of world tradeand so to our own economic prospects as a world-trading nation,SECRET1278 a
A. Association: Africa, the Caribbean and the colonies as regards the independent countries of the Commonwealth, and those whichwill shortly become independent, it has been agreed in principle that association withthe Community under Part IV of the Treaty of Rome would be a suitablearrangement for Commonwealth countries in Africa and the Caribbean which so desired, although doubts remain whether Ghana and the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland will be acceptable to the existing associates and thus to the Six.It has also been agreed that, at the appropriate time, there should be consultation between the member Governments of the Community (after consultation with theStates already associated) and the British Government (after consultation with theGovernments of the Commonwealth countries concerned) with a view to theassociation of these countries.2.   The following countries come into the above category:Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Jamaica, Trinidad, Ugandaand the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (although whether theFederation should be regarded as independent or dependent has been leftover for further discussion).3. As regards the dependent territories of the Commonwealth, it has beenagreed that, with some certain and some possible exceptions, association wouldprovide the most satisfactory arrangement for such territories and that they wouldbe eligible for it. It will be for Her Majesty&apos;s Government, at an appropriate moment, to state which of these territories are to be associated, after suchconsultations as may be necessary.  The exceptions are as follows:Hong Kong. The Six have agreed to work out with the British Government,before Britain&apos;s entry into the Community, appropriate measures in thefield of trade relations. The Hong Kong Government recognises thatprocedurally this is satisfactory.Aden. The Six wish to consider further the production of petroleum products.High Commission territories. Problems arise over the customs union with south Africa.Greater Malaysia. This has been left for later consideration.C-E.-F. G-Summary of progress to date5.   Progress to date can be briefly summarised as follows:A. Association. We have agreed that association with the enlarged community would be a suitable arrangement for nearly all our dependent territories, and for those independent Commonwealth countries in africa and the Caribbean which desire it.India, Pakistan and Ceylon. We have agreed provisional arrangementsfor the treatment of the exports of these countries.Manufactured products. We have agreed provisional arrangements forthe treatment of exports of these products from Canada, Australia andNew Zealand.D. Temperate agricultural products. We have made some progress and established much common ground on the general principles to be applied,though further work remains to be done, especially on the individual commodities. Here there will be a difficult problem of presentation tothe Commonwealth countries concerned.Raw materials, etc. Our request for nil tariffs has so far made onlylimited progress.Processed agricultural products. Discussion has hardly begun.-United Kingdom agriculture. We have reached important conclusionsabout a system of annual reviews and the assurances to producers, butthe whole range of individual commodities has still to be tackled.6. The following sections of this paper deal with each of these matters in turn.The concluding sections deal with the next phase in the Brussels negotiations andthe Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference.
What association would mean4. Association is provided for in Part IV of the Treaty of Rome andimplemented by a separate Convention annexed to the Treaty. This convention is due to be renewed for five years as from 1st January, 1963, and the terms of itsrenewal have not yet been finally agreed by the Six and the present associates. the six have, however, kept us informed of developments and we have a fairly completepicture of what the future regime of association will look like, at any rate as regardsthe commercial arrangements.Commercial arrangements5. Commonwealth countries and British dependencies which are associatedwill continue to enjoy duty free entry into Britain. They will, moreover, be ableto send their products into the countries of the Six at the gradually reducing tariffrates which are at present applied to products from the existing associates and fromother members of the Community, instead of over the full common external tariff.In the case of a number of tropical products (including coffee, cocoa, pineapplesand coconuts), the Six intend to reduce tariffs against associates to nil in one move on 1st January, 1963. The tariff on ail commodities from the associates will be completely abolished by the end of the transitional period6. When the necessary adjustments of tariff were complete, commonwealth countries that became Associates of the Community would have preferences bothin Britain and the rest of the Community over third countries (including non-associated Commonwealth countries) on those of their products on which theCommon External Tariff was not zero. They would be able to compete on equalterms with the existing Associates in the enlarged Community as a whole, andwould thus escape discrimination against them in the markets of the Six in favourof the existing Associates. The prospect of that discrimination has caused theCommonwealth countries concerned much anxiety in the past; no alternative course would avoid it. Their margin of preference in Britain might be less thanat present on some commodities, but on some of the major products (e.g., cocoaand bananas) it might be more than at present. On balance, therefore,Commonwealth countries which are associated would gain by the tariff privilegesconferred by association.Financial aid for the associates from the Development Fund7. The Six and their existing associates have not yet agreed on the total amount of financial assistance. But whatever the figure, it will all go to theexisting associates. We have accepted this. Additional sums will therefore be needed for the Commonwealth associates, if we join the Community, and wewould expect them to receive not less than our contribution to the development fund. Moreover, we would hope that they would also benefit from some increasein the contributions of existing members (e.g., Germany), and from contributions from new members or associated States in Europe (e.g., Denmark, Sweden and switzerland). The question whether any aid received by associated commonwealth countries from the Development Fund would be wholly additional to Britishbilateral aid is something which we shall have to decide, no doubt in consultationwith the Commonwealth countries concerned, but it can be confidently expectedthat they would not receive any less aid than they do&apos; at present, and they wouldprobably receive more.Institutions8. The institutions of the new regime of association are the most importantunknown factor. The form which these take will no doubt have an influence in determining the attitude of some Commonwealth Governments to association. Weunderstand that a Council of Association is proposed (consisting of the ministerial council of the E.E.C., members of the European Commission and members of theGovernments of Associated States), perhaps a Committee of Association and an assembly of members of the various Parliaments. It is, however, clear that, inthese institutions, the members of the E.E.C. and the Associated States would beon an equal footing as independent States.9. We have already given the Commonwealth countries and territories concerned all the information about the new regime which we possess. They must now begin to make up their minds whether they wish to be associated with the
enlarged Community or not. We hope to carry all this forward at the PrimeMinisters&apos; Conference, and subsequently in Brussels.Summary.10. It is clear that it would be to the economic advantage of commonwealth countries in Africa and the Caribbean, and of the dependent territories, to be associated with the E.E.C., both because of the commercial and aid arrangements,and because of the commercial disadvantages in the markets of the Communitywhich Commonwealth countries would suffer by comparison with their competitorsif they did not come in. The political factors are more difficult to assess. Thefundamental point is that the future regime of association will be on a basis of equality between the enlarged Community and the associated States, and this shouldmake it more acceptable to the Commonwealth countries concerned. But the institutions which will implement this principle of equality, and the votingprovisions, have not yet been settled and, until they are, an element of doubt must remain.11. If some of the Commonwealth countries in Africa and the Caribbeandecide against association there will be consultations between the UnitedKingdom and the Community about what alternative economic arrangements might be possible. Further discussion will also be needed at a later stage aboutthe level of the common external tariff on certain tropical products and abouttrade in tropical products of interest to Commonwealth countries and territories which do not become associated, though we could not expect to secure equivalentbenefits for them in this way.12. The main problems which have still to be settled in the Brusselsnegotiations are:(i) under what heading dependent or independent the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland might be associated;(ii) the form of the institutions of association;(iii) the size of the Commonwealth associates&apos; share in the increasedDevelopment Fund, and(iv) the status of Hong Kong, Malta and Gibraltar in relation to theCommunity.(v) the  position  of  Cyprus,  Greater  Malaysia,  Aden   and  the  high commission Territories.B. Exports from India, Pakistan and CeylonAt an early stage in the negotiations we tacitly recognised that associationunder Part IV was neither appropriate nor negotiable in respect of India, pakistan and Ceylon, while the Six for their part recognised that special arrangements would nevertheless have to be made for these under-developed countries. Since then theproblems of these three countries have been discussed together, although Ceylon&apos;strade is both smaller and much narrower in scope than that of India and Pakistan.2. The provisional arrangement covers by far the largest part of thesecountries&apos; trade with Britain. The only matters left for later negotiation are fourindustrial products (of which East India kips is far the most important) on whichwe have asked that the common external tariff should be reduced to nil; and a fewtropical products, including tobacco, where solutions depend on further discussions of these products as such. These outstanding items represent 9 and 4 per cent,respectively of the total trade with Britain of India and Pakistan: a negligiblequantity of Ceylon trade remains uncovered.3.   The main elements of the provisional settlement are:(a) An undertaking by the enlarged Community to negotiate, by 1966 at latest,comprehensive trade agreements with India and Pakistan, with theobject of developing mutual trade and increasing these countries&apos;foreign exchange earnings; and a similar agreement with Ceylon if sheso wishes.(b) Reduction of the common external tariff on tea to zero; reduction to zeroin the case of some relatively minor industrial products (e.g., sportsgoods); suspension of the common tariff on certain tropical products(e.g., cashew nuts).
(c) Special transitional arrangements for two commodities of particular difficulty-cotton textiles and jute.(d) A generous decal age for the application by Britain of the common external tariff to imports of the remaining industrial products and processedfoodstuffs.4. The obligation to negotiate comprehensive trade agreements is specificrecognition of the need to assist these countries to maintain and increase their exports and facilitate the implementation of their development plans. It is acceptedby the Six as an important step in the development of the Community&apos;s commercial policy, and represents a genuine effort to adopt a liberal attitude towards the trade of these developing countries.5. The elimination of the duty of 18 per cent, on tea is an importantconcession. Tea accounts for 43 per cent, of India&apos;s total exports to Britain; the comparable figures for Pakistan and Ceylon are 3 per cent, and 83 per cent. Thetrade in the other products on which the common external tariff has either beenreduced to nil or suspended is much less important; but, as in the case of tea, theeffect of this arrangement is not only that the Commonwealth countries concerned will maintain their existing free entry into the British market, but obtain new opportunities in the rest of the Community.6. The special transitional arrangements on cotton textiles and jute goods area compromise. In both cases there are three sets of interests involved: India and pakistan; the Six; and our domestic industries. The main elements in theprovisional agreement on cotton textiles are:(a) decal age in the application of the common external tariff by Britain. Therewill be four stages (of 20 per cent., 20 per cent., 30 per cent, and 30 percent.). For most cotton textiles the rate in the common external tariffis 18 per cent. The rates applied by Britain will therefore be of thefollowing order: 34- per cent, ad valorem on accession, 7 per cent.18 months later, 12^ per cent, a year later and 18 per cent, at the timewhen the common external tariff in full applies throughout theCommunity (probably by1 the beginning of 1967). This means that,subject to any changes agreed during the negotiations for the trade agreements, and subject to any delays as a consequence of the remedialprocedure (see below) we shall apply the common external tariff in fullby the time that the Community applies it. But we shall apply itgradually in the meantime: the provisions on cotton textiles contrast with the normal situation vis-a-vis third countries in which we shouldbe applying 60 per cent, of the common external tariff on accession.(b) Remedial action. In the interval between our accession and the conclusionof the trade agreements (or at the end of 1966 if they are not concluded by then) the enlarged Community undertakes to take remedial action ifIndia or Pakistani exports to the Community fall below an agreedbase level, as a result of Britain&apos;s application of the tariff. (The preciselevel is to be negotiated, but it will not be less favourable to India and pakistan than the average of their exports to the Community, includingBritain, in 1959 and 1960.) The Commission has the responsibilityfor initiating remedial action, which may take various forms: action by the Community as a result of the Commission^ recommendations(this could include, for instance, relaxation of quota restrictions);action by Britain, either by postponing further application of thecommon tariff, suspending in part or in whole that part of the tariffwhich had already been applied, or by creating a duty quota.(c) Restraint on the level of imports into Britain. Until the common external,policy is established, Britain undertakes to limit her imports from Indiaand Pakistan to approximately the level for which provision is madein the current voluntary agreements. If voluntary agreements cannotbe renewed our obligation to limit the quantity in our own marketremains.(d) Control system. During the period when Britain is applying less than thefull common tariff to India and Pakistan goods, we undertake to preventthe circulation of these goods within the Community by withholdingcirculation certificates, if there is an abnormal increase in Britain&apos;s
exports to the rest of the Community as the result of our imports ofIndia and Pakistan goods. If this control system proves impracticable,or ineffective, it will be open to other Members to take other correctiveaction, with the agreement of the Commission.7. The gains for India and Pakistan are thus a measure of decal age in our application of the tariff and the provision for remedial action. As part of the bargain they will, however, have to accept the continued limitation of their exportsto Britain (though we had already independently decided, for domestic reasons,that this was necessary to the end of 1965). As part of the bargain we have hadto accept a control scheme which is one sided, to the disadvantage of our domesticindustry, though we succeeded in confining the one-sided nature of it to the period in which we are not yet applying the common external tariff in full (i.e., in practiceprobably up to the end of 1966).8. Jute goods are a special problem because at present, as a unique&apos;arrangement, we give protection to Dundee against Asian goods; although there isno tariff, some goods are entirely excluded, and most of the rest are subject to asystem of &quot; mark-ups &quot;, so that they carry a surcharge varying from about 20 percent, to about 45 per cent, when sold here. At the same time some jute goods from europe are entirely excluded and others are imported over our m.f.n. tariff andsubject to licensing control (though in practice they are licensed freely). As far asEuropean goods are concerned, the provisional agreement requires us progressivelyto eliminate the tariff without any special timetable, but allows us to continue to ease Dundee&apos;s position until 1970 by imposing quota restrictions at an initially low level (3,000 tons), rising by 700 tons a year. So far as India&apos;s and Pakistani goods are concerned the agreement requires us to apply the common external tariff inaccordance with the normal timetable, taking account of acceleration decisions,and therefore without decal age. Our requests for nil duties on certain heavy jutegoods have been left over for further discussion.9. The agreement does not cover the other arrangements that we have inmind for the trade in jute goods of India and Pakistan, though we have told the six of our intentions. These are to admit Indian and Pakistan goods which haveformerly been excluded; to keep all trade from these countries in the hands ofthe Jute Control until 1st January, 1970, when the Control would be abolished;and to phase out the combined level of protection (tariff plus mark-up) until, by 1st January, 1970, the full common external tariff (at present 23 per cent.) becameDundee&apos;s sole protection.10. The agreement specifically states that a &quot; common commercial policy &quot;on jute goods must be established before the negotiation of the trade agreement.This is likely to cause India and Pakistan to fear that a more restrictive regimewill then be introduced; and on the other hand to cause Dundee disquiet since wecannot give an absolute assurance that the Jute Control (and Dundee&apos;s additionalprotection by mark-up) will survive until 1970.11. For the majority of industrial goods and processed foodstuffs theprovisional arrangement provides for an extended system of decal age. In contrast to the arrangements agreed for cotton textiles, the common external tariff willnot be applied in full until 1st January, 1970, irrespective of any accelerationdecision by the Community. Britain would apply 15 per cent, of the C.E.T. rate on accession; 15 per cent, on 1st July, 1965; 20 per cent, on 1st January, 1967; 20 percent, on 1st July, 1968; and take the last step of 30 per cent, on 1st January, 1970.This gives a good deal of time for India and Pakistan to adjust to the new conditions. Moreover, it has the result that only a small part of the common external tariff will have been applied by Britain, at the time when the comprehensivetrade agreements are being negotiated. For instance, where the common tariffwill eventually be at the rate of 10 per cent, ad valorem, the British tariff againstIndia will stand at 3 per cent, by the end of 1966; in the case of a tariff at the rateof 25 per cent., Britain&apos;s rate against India would be 1\ per cent, ad valorem by 1966.Commentary12. It is satisfactory that we were able -to reach provisional agreement onpractically all the trade of these three countries. Unlike some other commonwealth countries, they are already in a position to see, virtually as a whole, the arrangements which will govern their trade if we accede to the Community.   In the long term
much, of course, depends on the nature of the trade agreements which theCommunity have undertaken to negotiate with them.    But the objectives,specifically set out in the provisional arrangements, are liberal-for example, theyrefer to the need to maintain, and as far as possible increase, the level of foreign currency receipts  and to  facilitate the  implementation of  these  countries&apos;development plans.   The means, which are also set out in some detail, includespecific references to tariff and quota policy.   There is plenty of scope forliberalising the Community&apos;s arrangements for these countries&apos; imports (forinstance, by lifting quota restrictions or reducing duties, on an m.f.n. basis, onproducts of interest to India and Pakistan) without conflicting with the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.   The Governments of India and Pakistanhave moved a considerable way from the attitudes that they took up at the outset of our negotiations.   At that time they were asking for continued free entry for all their products into the British market for an unlimited time.   At alater stage they accepted that, subject to the negotiation of comprehensive trade agreements, the common external tariff would have to be applied in full by 1970.They did, however, try hard to promote the view that in the meantime the common tariff should be applied at a token level only, e.g., ad valorem 1 per cent.  Theirrepresentatives have expressed some disappointment with the eventual outcome.However, it seems to us not unfavourable to these countries, and indeed to holdout prospects of real gain for the future.  The main gain has been the recognition by the Six of obligations towards them, as under-developed countries, and the specific offer of a comprehensive trade agreement.  It may be necessary to remindthese Governments at some stage that some of the concessions that we have obtained for them (e.g., remedial action in the case of cotton textiles) have been at the expense of the interests of our domestic industries.C. Manufactured goods from Canada, Australia and New zealand the provisional arrangements on so-called &quot; manufactured goods&quot; from canada, Australia and New Zealand apply to all industrial products including some raw materials shown in the latest available statistics of exports from these three countries to Britain, with the exception of those on which the common external tariff is already nil, and those for which we have asked that it should bereduced to nil.2. The Treaty of Rome provides for the full application of the common external tariff by 1st January, 1970. But the Six have in practice accelerated theirown timetable and it now seems likely that the common tariff will be applied in fullby 1966 or 1967. In respect of the products covered by the provisional arrangements,however, Britain will be allowed to delay the application of the common tariff(decal age) and impose it in three stages: 30 per cent, of it at the time of accession to the Community, 30 per cent, on the 1st January, 1967, and 40 per cent, on1st January, 1970. In addition there is agreement that the enlarged community should be ready to take part in multilateral tariff negotiations for the reciprocalreduction of tariffs on industrial products. There is also provision for consultation between the enlarged Community and the three countries concerned in 1966 and1969 (i.e., before the second and third stages of the application of the tariff by theUnited Kingdom) to examine the development of its trade with them.3. The broad effect of the provisional arrangements is to give these three countries time to adjust their trade with Britain (most of which at present entersfree of duty and with a preference) to a changed situation when a tariff will be imposed. Assuming that the Community adopted the common external tariff infull by 1967, the Commonwealth countries would get an extra three years of adjustment. During the early years of this period they will retain some degree ofpreference in certain cases, over Community suppliers, and throughout the period to 1970 they would retain substantial, though diminishing, preferences against third countries in most cases.4. There is also the prospect of reductions in the common tariff, from which commonwealth countries could benefit, as a result of multilateral tariff negotiations,possibly in response to the new trade legislation in the United States. (It can,however, be argued that this is not much of a concession, since the Communitymight in any case be expected to respond to a United States initiative.)5. The Six have undertaken to consider with the Commonwealth countries the development of this trade in 1966 and 1969, and &quot; in the light of all the
D. Temperate agricultural products from the old CommonwealthSection D of the paper sent to Commonwealth Governments (circulatedseparately) reproduces the Brussels Conference paper on temperate agricultural products as it emerged from the Ministerial meeting on 5th August.&apos; 2. I summed up the status of this paper at the end of the meeting by sayingthat we had hoped, in the case of temperate foodstuffs, to have reached a provisionalsettlement of the kind which had proved possible in a number of other cases,e.g., manufactures from.the old Commonwealth, the question of India, pakistan and Ceylon, and association. In this case it had not been possible to reach asimilar outline of a possible solution. I pointed out also that there were a great many gaps in the document which we had been considering as far as commoditieswere concerned. The whole subject was of the greatest importance, both to her majesty&apos;s Government and to the Commonwealth Governments concerned, andin view of the fact that the arrangements now contemplated derived from a new approach, it was essential that there should be the fullest opportunity for the UnitedKingdom Government to consider this matter further in consultation with theCommonwealth Governments concerned. (This &apos;was, of course, a reference tothe Prime Ministers&apos; Conference, but arrangements are also being made forpreliminary official discussions with Australia, Canada and New Zealand.)3. My colleagues will remember that, when the negotiations started, our aimwas to secure the agreement of the Six to:(a) a general formula intended to secure for the Commonwealth &quot; comparableopportunity of outlets &quot;, both in the transitional period and in the longer term;(b) specific transitional arrangements to achieve this objective; and(c) arrangements for a review which would ensure that, after the transitional period, the same objective would be secured by means of whateverarrangements were appropriate at that time.4. Our original proposals envisaged an understanding with the Six thatquantitative restrictions would not be applied against the Commonwealth up to thelevel of traditional quantities, i.e., an assured right of access for agreed amounts.This gave the Six-and indeed others the impression that we were seeking aguarantee of actual sales. Although this was not, of course, the case, it became clear at an early stage that the Six were in any case not prepared to adopt our approach. They felt that such-basically quantitative arrangements would tendto freeze the pattern of trade, and freeze it, moreover, in a way which would maintainthe preferential position of the Commonwealth. This would have been in directconflict with their view that the longer term policy of the Community should benon-discriminatory.circumstances and in conformity with the provision of, the Treaty [to] take appropriate steps.&quot; We have at least secured for these countries the opportunityto demonstrate damage to their trade if, as they (but not the Six) expect, damage in fact takes place. Because of the, broad coverage of the provisional agreement,the Commonwealth would get the benefit of decal age on all items on which thereis some trade at present, whether this is traditional and well established or only inits infancy. There would be no quantitative limitation on their exports.Commentary6. We never expected that the Six would agree to indefinite free entry formanufactured goods from Canada, Australia and New Zealand and we made thisclear to the Commonwealth countries concerned before the negotiations began.In the case of Australia and New Zealand the value of the trade is extremely small(2-5 per cent, and 0 -1 per cent, respectively of Australia and New Zealand&apos;s total exports to Britain) and it was impossible to argue that serious damage could result from the application of the common external tariff. Nor could we argueconvincingly that the tariff would necessarily damage Canada&apos;s trade. Her exportsof these products to Britain are much smaller than her exports of the sameproducts to other countries (including the United States and, in some cases, the six) over a tariff barrier. The settlement seems as good as We could expect inthese circumstances.
5. The Six approached the problem in an entirely different way, and I am satisfied that it is only by following their approach that we can hope to reach afinal agreement with them. Indeed, it is fair to say that a comparison of the paper which has emerged from Brussels and our original &quot; comparable outlets formula &quot;suggests that the former is&apos; likely to be a more realistic as well as a more comprehensive approach towards achieving a solution of the Commonwealth^basic and long-term problems. .&apos;,6.  The new framework on which we have been working is as follows:id) A declaration about the price and production policies of the Community.(b) An agreement about the need for, and the purposes of, world-widecommodity agreements.(c) An agreement that specific solutions on a more limited geographical basis,but with the same content, should be negotiated if the wider agreementsunder (b) do not prove possible.id) Transitional arrangements linked to the operation of the intra-Communitypreference, andie) Undertakings by the Community about the use of quantitative restrictions,&quot;i.e., about access.Price policy7. The agreement which we have reached on price policy (which iswithout limit) goes further than we had originally thought possible. It is centralto the whole problem. In the last resort the price policy of the Community willbe the real determinant of Commonwealth prospects for the future. If the price policy were such as to encourage surplus production within the Community,then any other agreements which we might have agreed, would be jeopardised. Infact the Community have now stated their intention of pursuing a policy which willoffer reasonable opportunities in its markets for exports of temperate foodstuffs, witha special reference to Commonwealth suppliers. Moreover, they have agreed to aconfrontation of price policies in the context of world-wide agreements whichwill enable interested parties to bring strong pressure to bear on them to maintainreasonable policies. It is significant that the United States appear to be preparedto follow this new lead, as do the Australians, and it seems possible that a newpattern of international consultation may be emerging which we should do well to encourage. -   :.oWorld-wide agreements ior more limited agreements)8. The question of price policy is linked with that of future world-wideagreements. Here, what is proposed is an attempt to work out world-wideagreements designed to deal with the problems of prices, production policies, accessand the terms of competition. A recent telegram from Mr. Menzies showed theimportance which Australia attaches to these new developments. ManyCommonwealth countries are now concerned not so much about preferences assuch, but with the general pattern of price competition which they claim has reduced their returns, even with the benefit of preferences, to unreasonably lowlevels.9. It will be a major and difficult task to secure early agreement on theterms of new world-wide arrangements. The assurances about the willingness of the Six and ourselves to negotiate them are, however, valuable. We shall,however, be helped by the willingness of the Six to negotiate agreements on amore limited geographical basis, particularly with Commonwealth countries, ifworld-wide agreements prove impracticable. This gives the Commonwealth an assurance that progress will not be made impossible by the veto of a country, or group of countries, outside the Community and the Commonwealth.Transitional arrangements and quantitative restrictions10. Here we have secured some gains. In the first place the Six have demonstrated to us, and to the Commonwealth, that our concern about the possibleapplication,of quantitative restrictions was misconceived. They have agreed with us a form.of words which makes it clear that the Community would not require&quot;member!States- -including, of course, Britain-to use quantitative restrictions as an instrument of policy to control access, except as a general Community measure&apos; toSECRET1278 b

The rate of this reductionhas been left over for further discussion.12. Apart from the intra-Community preference, we have not been able tosecure a preferential position for the Commonwealth in our market (with thepossible exception of New Zealand-see paragraph 14 below). In the ease of coarse grains, the existing preference of 10 per cent, in the United Kingdom appearson the face of it to be much more valuable than an intra-Community preference of 1 per cent, (which is the level at which it has been fixed for the first year). Thefact is, however, that the intra-Community preference which would replace theold Commonwealth preference is different in kind. . Although it affords nosafeguards as. regards the price level, a country which has this new preference should be in a position.to secure access to Community markets with an absoluteadvantage over all third countries who do not enjoy this preference.Financial Regulation , .&apos; &apos;&quot;&quot;. &quot; &apos;v ; fl3.r One further matter was introduced at a very late stage in the discussion in brussels whichimay.causefurther difficulty in future,. The French were concerned that we should agree to an interpretation of the Financial Regulation which apparently nieant. that the full proceeds of the levies would be surrenderedin the Comrnon Market period, irrespective of the fair apportioning of community expenses. When we asked for more time to,consider the implications of this interpretation, they placed a reserve on the whole of the temperate foodstuffsdocument. A separate paper will be circulated dealing with the FinancialRegulation. -   - &apos;New Zealand - -^;-l:4. There has been a new development as regards New Zealand. The Sixhave: taken ftie mitiative&apos; in emphasising that they recognise that New Zealand, withits special dependence on the United Kingdom market for its exports of foodstuffs,is a special case, and they have offered to consider solutions for her problems. Aseparate paper is being prepared on this. -cCommentary15. The arrangements described above include some elements of considerable advantage for the oldGommonwealth countries concerned. But it will not be easy to convince,the threeCommonwealth Governments, and they may well criticise the arrangements on the grounds &quot;th t they are not sufficiently precise to enabletheir exact effects on. trade to be calculated in quantitative terms. We can dealwith this criticism, and in general we must take the line that the effectiveness of thearrangements must depend on the spirit in which they are carried out by theComtriuriity, Rearing, in.mind that, in the circumstances envisaged, we should,&apos;be members of it.,&apos;    . &apos;.-: ,   -V\ &apos;r\ 16. The arrangements provide for Commonwealth interests to,be protected by means of. a series pi inter-locking assurances of cumulative, effect. They applyto the wholeiof the enlarged Community, mot merely-as we were originally asking^tOitheiUnitedjKihgdora market alone. In the. first place, there is: the assurance that the enlarged Community will take an early initiative.to secure, international agreements? covering the key-commodities. If, in the; case of any commodity,this -initiative ofails^ i then the Community.. will be ready ; ta conclude agreements
with the same purposes on a more limited basis-&quot; and, in particular, with commonwealth countries&quot;. Secondly the enlarged Community has expressedits intention of pursuing a price policy which will offer reasonable opportunities for exports of temperate foodstuffs. In addition, the Community is prepared to consult about these policies, either within the framework of international agreementsor of more limited agreements. They have also undertaken to do their utmost tocontribute to the harmonious development of world trade, with a special referenceto the Commonwealth. So far as restrictions on trade are concerned; they have givenus assurances that quantitative restrictions will not be used except in exceptional circumstances; and that the infra-Community preference will not be operated in away which causes damage to Commonwealth interests.17. As I said earlier, much common ground has been established though agood deal of work remains to be done, especially on individual commodities -dairy products, meat and sugar and in order to give greater precision to some of theproposed arrangements, e.g., about the intra-Community preference and for new Zealand. But I am satisfied that the approach which has been adopted is the:only realistic one. Subject to what may be agreed on individual commodities, weshall not be able to secure radical changes in the arrangements we have negotiated.We should therefore put them forward as a basis for discussion at the commonwealth prime Ministers&apos; Conference, and as representing a fair and reasonable way of safeguarding their vital interests. This conclusion was endorsed by the common market Negotiations Committee at their meeting on 10th August.E. Raw materials, etc. Nil tariff requestsWe told the Six from the outset that we wished the common external tariffto be reduced to nil on a short list of industrial raw materials of importance toour domestic processing industries and to our Commonwealth suppliers. In thecourse of the negotiations 27 items have been discussed. Of these we have withdrawn one (sulphur) because the rate in the common tariff proved to be nilalready; and agreed to defer discussion on another (petroleum products) on whichthe Six themselves have not yet reached agreement on the level of the common tariff. Four items of interest to India and Pakistan, have been discussed in the context of the provisional agreement on these countries&apos; trade generally. TheCommonwealth&apos;s interest in the remaining items are mainly those of Canada, inparticular, and Australia and New Zealand.; 2. Our requests in this field are of varying importance. The largest, both from the domestic and the Commonwealth point of view are the following (figures in brackets show the value of Commonwealth exports to Britain and the rate of duty in the common external tariff): - - &apos;- -(i) Aluminium. Canada ( 26 million). Australia, New Zealand and Ghanahave large investment plans based on the British market (C.E.T.9 per cent.).(ii) Lead. Australia ( 8 million) and Canada ( 3 million) (C.E.T. 7-4 per,      cent, ad valorem equivalent).(iii) Zinc-Canada ( 8 million) and Australia ( 1 million) (C.E.T. 6-4 percent, ad valorem equivalent). -(iv) wood pulp. Canada ( 11 million) (C.E.T. 6 per cent.).(v) Newsprint. Canada ( 23 million) (C.E.T. 7 per cent.)..3. The Six have shown no ready disposition to meet us. In order to make progress we agreed to discuss various alternatives to nil duties, while maintaining that in our view nil duties were the right solution. The more importantalternatives, consistent with the Treaty of Rome, are the duty quotas for which provision is made in the List G Protocol and in Article 25. The quotas in the list G Protocol apply to specified products and are of varying forms. The mostliberal quota arrangement that for wood pulp is in practice equivalent to a niltariff so far as our market is concerned,;since it allows us to&apos; import duty freeup to the limit of our domestic requirements and, once agreed, can be alteredonly by \ unanimous decision. Duty quotas, under Article 25 (1) allow for theimport of fixed quantities at a nil, or reduced rate of, duty, of goods traditionallyimported from third countries and in short supply in the Community; the quantities will therefore diminish as Community supplies increase and these quotasare? subject to periodical review and to; alteration by qualified majority.   Duty
Ferro chromeList G ProtocolWoodpulp is the most important of these, and all of them except rosin are ofinterest to Canada.       - -&apos;Commentary .,   -       .......- . .;.. 6, In the concluding stages of the negotiations there was no time to take further the discussions on our nil tariff requests, and indeed the Six have notyet been able to agree among themselves what proposals to put to us On someof the most important of them. The main difficulties on their side are that the domestic industries of some of them (particularly France and Italy) are strongly opposed to reductions in the tariff; that the discussion causes them to reopenitiatters which they patched up between themselves Only with the greatest difficulty&apos;;and that they are reluctant to give any side benefits to other countries (e.g., the&quot;United States) without compensation. There is the additional complication that&quot;some Of these products (particularly aluminium) are of great interest to Norway,which is known to oppose our requests for nil duties. Some of these difficultiesmay become less formidable in the process of further negotiation, but theprotectionist interests of the Six will not. It seems unlikely that we shall get eithernil-duties, of a solution of the kind of the List G Protocol for wood pulp, for anyof the four major items still unresolved, with the possible exception of newsprint,and the best we may be able to get on the metals is some small reduction in thecommon external tariff on aluminium and duty quotas of some kind for lead andzinc. We have no bargaining power here and shall have to settle for the best wecan get both on the major items and the remaining smaller items (the solutionof some of which will be consequential on the settlements for the major products).7. The Americans have let it be known that they would be willing to pay compensation to the Six for reductions of duty on products of interest to them, e.g.,aluminium. It is difficult to say whether the effect of this will be to encourage the six to reduce duties in our current negotiations or, on the contrary, to harden their opposition in order to retain bargaining power for the future. But at least thefact that the Americans are prepared to pay strengthens the possibility of usefulreductions, Of benefit to the Commonwealth and ourselves, in multilateral tariff negotiations after the new United States trade legislation has been passed. -F.-Processed agricultural products &quot;These products are those temperate agricultural products on which the Sixdo not intend to have a common agricultural policy and where producers inside the Community will therefore be protected only by the tariff. They are mostlyprocessed foodstuffs, though in the proposals put forward so far we have includedin this field certain products such as leather which are ordinarily regarded -as industrial.        i - - -        f\-1 -     -&quot;&apos; &apos;The Commonwealth interest -- *. .     :- .. -   :;        ; , .; 2. New Zealand&apos;s interest is comparatively small. The Canadian, and stillmore the Australian, interest is much greater, and some of the products are ofquotas under - Article 25 (2) are- still- more restrictive; -they are granted at the discretion of the Commission and only where a Member&apos;s processing industry islikely to suffer damage as the result of shortage of supplies within the Community.4. A quota of the kind provided for wood pulp in the List G Protocol would therefore meet our domestic requirements and maintain Commonwealth free entryin the British market (though from the Commonwealth&apos;^ point of view it is not as satisfactory as a nil duty which would also offer new opportunities in the markets of the present Community). Other kinds of duty quotas are less reliable, asregards both quantity and duration, particularly as it is known that the Community(and especially the Commission) wish to eliminate duty quotas as soon as possible.5. In the negotiations so far, we have obtained provisional arrangements forthe treatment of six products as follows.: , -wood pulp                ...      ... List G Protocol-           Acetylene black ......... Nil duty.. Rosin     ...    ....      ...      ... . decal age as for industrial goods and. a duty quota under Article 25(1)Nickel copper ....     .......... Nil duty7: Ferro silicon
considerable importance to them. For example, in 1961 we imported from Australiaover  7 million of canned fruit-as much in value as our imports from Australiaof lead and zinc together and  4 million of dried fruit, and we imported over 2 million of canned salmon from Canada. At present the ^commonwealth countries enjoy free entry into the United Kingdom market for all the itemsconcerned and on most of them have a preference over third countries.The interest of the Six3. The Six produce most of the products themselves (or products whichcompete with those of the Commonwealth) and, although the common external tariff on some of them is nil, on most there is a high duty-for example, the dutyon canned peaches is 25 per cent. &apos;The negotiations so far4, We began by proposing that the common external tariff be reduced to nilon a list of eleven items, including canned salmon, canned fruit and dried vinefruit. The Australian and New Zealand Governments objected strongly: although,if we had succeeded in securing nil duties, this would have given them new opportunities in the markets of the Six, their main concern was (and still is) toretain their preferential position in the British market. Accordingly, afterconsultation with the three Commonwealth Governments, we put forward in Junerevised proposals based on: .&apos;;     &quot; &apos; r&apos;:(a) nil duties or reductions in duty on some dozen items (including canned salmon and canned fruit); ^ ,,(b) duty free or duty preference quotas for the Commonwealth countries forthe items on which we were asking for tariff reductions, and for all theother items in which they had an existing trade. There was to be provision for growth in certain cases. The quota system was to operatefor the whole transitional period, with provision for review at the endof it to decide on subsequent arrangements. This would have kept open the possibility of maintaining preferences for the Commonwealthindefinitely.5. The Six rejected these proposals and instead proposed delayedApplication of the common external tariff (decal age) on the lines already agreed formanufactured goods; they suggested, however, that they might be able to reducethe tariff on a few products and agree to a slower timetable of decal age for -afew others.   &apos; V V6. In the light of this, and after consultation with the Commonwealth, mycolleagues authorised me to fall back to more modest proposals. These were: toaccept decal age as a general solution, provided that the Six would agree to reductions in duty, or duty quotas (and in the case of a very few items, both) onthe more important products. In the event I had no opportunity to&apos;, put forwardthese revised proposals.7. Meanwhile the Australians have been discussing their position with the americans. The Americans said and have since made their position known tothe Six that they could not accept arrangements for the indefinite continuation of preference for the Commonwealth on canned and dried fruit. Duty quotas forthe Commonwealth would therefore be unacceptable to them; instead they proposed a reduction in the tariff (for which they. were prepared to offercompensation to the Six); they were prepared however to accept delayedapplication of the common tariff on these Australian goods, so that the Australianswould have a small preference in the British market for a short period. the australians have made it clear that this is not acceptable to them at this stage, andthat they could consider it only if further negotiations showed that no bettersolution were possible. . , &apos;&apos;:&quot;Our future negotiating position/ 8. When the negotiations are resumed,, we shall presumably have to begin by putting forward the revised proposals described in paragraph 6 above, whichwere agreed; with the Commonwealth a month ago. But in the light of the attitude that the Six have; taken in other areas of the negotiations, it is doubtful whether
.14 T SECRET ^these revised proposals are negotiable in their present form. It. is necessary toreach a view now on what we could realistically hope to get^ so that we may be.guided ,rneanwhile: in;discussions...with Commonwealth Qovernments,-during thenext few weeks..-;      y... u^-l^i^j^&apos;\ 7X. ;777^:7a i7y7fii9. The main feature of our revised proposals which we shall probably haveto abandon is that.of duty quotas.  Discussion on temperate foodstuffs has made:i: it clear that; the Six; will not accept any system which implies ;the indefinitecontinuation of: Commonwealth preferences. . Their attitude will- have been: reinforced : by the views on processed foodstuffs- which the Americans haveexpressed. r\ Even if the Six were prepared to agree to duty quotas ?they would insist on -a progressive decline m the quantities and the disappearance of the quotastoy the end of the transitional period, at latest. Moreover, the Six dislike dutyquotas as a mechanism. -10. There are, however, prospects of concessions in the form of reductions in duly and delayed application of the tariff. We should concentrate on getting the maximum in these two directions. The Six have already, offered decal age,over the whole range of products, in accordance with the timetable agreed formanufactured goods. We should try to get a more extended timetable for as many items as possible. / , &apos;11. Although we should seek concessions on these lines for all the productscovered by our revised proposals (see paragraph 6 above) we should concentrateour efforts particularly on the three major items: canned salmon, canned fruit and dried Vine fruit. So far as canned salmon is concerned, the Commonwealthinterest (as well as our domestic interest) will be best served by the largestreduction, that we can get in the rate of duty. For the other two we should alsoseek reductions in the duty (possibly to 15 per cent. the figure mentioned in thediscussions between the Australians and the Americans-in the case of. canned fruit; and a reduction to 6 per cent/ the maximum allowed by the associationagreement with Greece--in the case of dried fruit). On these two products weshould also seek as. long a delay as possible in applying the common external tariff.If we cannot secure both concessions, and are offered a choice, we should be guided by the Australian Government^ views.12. Canned and dried fruit account for two-thirds of the Australian trade&quot;at risk &quot; in this field, and canned salmon for nearly a quarter of the Canadianinterest. If we secured concessions on these three items alone, provided that theywere substantial concessions, we should have gone some way in Australia^ casea considerable way to meet, these countries&apos; interests. Any concessions that wecan get on the other items in our list will be helpful, but we should not press these to the point of prejudicing a satisfactory outcome on the three major items..    ;G.-United Kingdom agriculture in the field of domestic agriculture, the aspects on which there has been substantial progress in the negotiations are the procedure for annual reviews andthe provision of a general assurance for farmers.Annual Reviews .   &apos;. 1. The provision for annual reviews in the formula which has been agreedcan be presented to pur agricultural: industry and to the country generally as a significant achievement by the United Kingdom in the negotiations. Although itis known that the Commission^ own plans already envisaged an annual reporton the development of the common agricultural policy, the formula would impose a specific obligation, on the Commission to conduct comprehensive annual reviewsand it prescribes the material to be taken into account by the Commission (includingthe results of national annual reviews and Governments&apos; observations thereon).The formula requires the Commission to report the results of its CommunityReview to the Council of Ministers and to make appropriate proposals to theCouncil in the light of those results. It also states explicitly that the Communityshall make use of those results in reaching decisions on the application of thecommon agricultural policy. &quot;       :V ;   ..&quot;;;&apos;    12.   The formula expressly provides for member States, if they wish, to carry. out national annual reviews and for the results.of such reviews, with the appropriate
Governments&apos; observations on them,, to be; taken into account by the Commissionin carrying, out a Community Annual Review.    .      - &apos;        c&quot; ... - - 1&apos;*&quot;3V:&apos;-By:&apos; thus paving the way: for&apos; the continuation of anniiaf reviews in theUnited Kingdom and by ensuring that the annual review system should have an, established place in- the-&apos;. implementation, of -. the. common agricultural &quot;policy, the- provisional agreement meets points.to which the Fanners&apos; Unions of the UnitedKingdom, have attached- considerable importance. The - English. rN.F.U. hascommented that: the value of the agreed procedure will depend largely on whetherindividual.: countries conduct national reviews; though it: acknowledges, that. theneed to provide, national data for. the Community.review may prompt member, States to institute their.own reviews. But .our inability toipersuade,the Six,to makeit obligatory for all member States to conduct national reviews does not seriouslydetract from the value of the agreement. The Government can agree that theCpmmunity&apos;s procedures should impose the minimum of new obligations onmember States, and that it would have been unreasonable to require members to conduct national annual reviews against their will, particularly since they are not all at present equipped with the necessary statistical and other administrativemechanisms. Nevertheless, we can expect that, as the Community Annual Reviewsystem develops, all member States will find value in conducting their own reviewsalso. -        &quot;&quot;        &quot; &apos;&apos;: Y&apos;;&apos;&apos;General Assurance -&apos; &apos;   1 -i 4. The agreed formula also provides that if the Community annual reviewindicates that the agricultural population of the Comtnuhity, br 6f particular $feasof it. is not getting a fair standard of living, in conformity with Article 39 of the&quot;Treaty, the1 Commission either on its own initiative or at the; request of a member state will take up the question, and will submit to the&apos; Council of Ministers any proposals for remedial measures that it considers necessary. This agreement means that the Community have accepted a procedure for ensuring a &quot;fair standard ofliving for the agricultural population; this is an important step in giving greaterdefinition to the common policy and to the general principles of the Treaty.5. It is true that, as the N.F.U. have not been slow to point out, the provisional agreement falls short of the Governments objective, as stated; at the opening ofthe negotiations, that member States should in the last resort have the right to takeautonomous action to safeguard the living standards of their own farmingcommunities. It became clear during the negotiations, however, that suchautonomous action was incompatible with the private&amp;ciples&apos;;on wJiidhtKe&apos;C.om&apos;rnupii!y&apos;arrangements are based, and that it would be unrealistic to expect the Six to accept our original proposition. The agreement that has been reached can nevertheless he presented as a substantial improvement on-&quot;the Six?s present ariangemehts: it provides member States with a recognised procedure for securing discussion of theagricultural standard of living in any part of. the Community, and the UnitedKingdom, as a full member, will be able to exert its influence in the deliberationsleading to decisions by the Community^ institutions.6. There may be some difficulty in allaying fears among our. farmers that,despite the general assurance, their problems are likely to be regarded by theCommunity&apos;s institutions less sympathetically than those of their less prosperouscounterparts elsewhere in the enlarged Community The answer to this must reston the relative efficiency of our farmers and their ability to compete on level terms with their less favoured counterparts, on the general intention of the Treaty thatthere shall be a levelling-up of standards, and ultimately on the influence Which&apos;the:&apos;United Kingdom-will wield-in the.Qrgan&apos;s&apos;-df-;the Community;--&apos;-&apos;&apos;- -Outstanding issues &apos; &apos;7. The.provisional agreement on annual reviews and.the, general assuranceis a first step in securing satisfactory conditions for British agriculture in. the enlarged community. It constitutes a framework into which satisfactory arrangements, forthe individual commodities and other aspects have still to be fitted, At this juncturethe provisional agreement provides grounds on which our farming.community can reasonably he asked to suspend judgment until further progress has been made inthe negotiations oh other important facets of the agricultural problem. The industry will attach crucial significance to the arrangements weare able to negotiate with the six for (a) the implementation within the enlarged Community of the common
agricultural policy for pigs, eggs and horticulture, on which (as on cereals) they havealready adopted regulations, (b) the assimilation of the United Kingdom to theCommunity&apos;s regime for those commodities, and (c) effective United Kingdomparticipation in working out the arrangements for other commodities.Commonwealth interest in provisional agreement on annual reviews and generalassurance .......&quot; 8. The Commonwealth may be suspicious of the provisional agreement in sofar as it implies a policy of bolstering-up agriculture in the enlarged community and of maintaining a high level of production of commodities which theCommonwealth hopes to export to Europe. This is a fundamental issue that goesfar wider than the formula for annual reviews and the general assurance. It couldbe pointed out to the Commonwealth, however, that the material which, under the agreed formula, member States are required to provide for the Community annual review includes information about &quot;consumption and imports includinginformation on imports so arranged as to bring out the position of trade with third countries in agricultural products covered by the review &quot;, and that the Communityannual review has to include an assessment of the implications of price and costtrends in the Community on production, consumption, imports and exports.Commonwealth countries should be in favour of the searching analysis of thesituationof. agriculture in the Community for, which the formula provides.The Next Phase in the Brussels NegotiationsI start from the assumption that we shall not seek to re-open the arrangements which have been provisionally agreed, and that the primary task will be to concentrate on the business which is either unfinished of-as in the case of processedagricultural products, for example -not really begun.2. On manufactured products from Canada, Australia and New Zealandthere is some detailed tidying-up to be done. - On India, Pakistan and Ceylon thereare a few points which require further discussion, such as the level of the common external tariff on East India kips and heavy jute goods. On association there are some important questions about institutions and finance which are of general application. The position of certain individual territories will also require furtherconsideration. The most difficult of these are the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland and Hong Kong.3. As regards temperate agricultural products, there is little, if any, furtherscope for negotiation on the basic principles described earlier in this note. We andthe Six have agreed to come back to the question of the rate of phasing out of theintra-Community preference. More important, there is the question of the remainingindividual commodities, particularly for the transitional period. On these we shallhave to consider how far our original proposals will have to be modified in the lightof What has happened in the negotiations so far and to take account of the general principles. A further paper or papers will be submitted to the Common MarketNegotiations Committee shortly. There are also the questions of the FinancialRegulation and the special position of New Zealand. Here again further papersfor the Common Market Negotiations Committee are being prepared..! 4. As regards United Kingdom agriculture, the whole range of the commoditieshas still to be dealt with, including horticulture, as well as the question of the directfarming grants.5. Apart from the foregoing items, the main unfinished business relates to ourrequests for nil tariffs on certain raw materials, etc., and processed agricultural products, which I recommend should be dealt with on the lines proposed in SectionsE and F above.Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; ConferenceOur primary objective at the Conference must be to impress on commonwealth Prime Ministers the strength of the broad political case for UnitedKingdom membership of the European Economic Community. We shall haveto explain how we see our future position in the world developing if we join the six and become a leading power in a united Western Europe, and we shall haveto contrast this with the way in which our position is likely to develop if we stand
outside. In doing this we shall have to deal with the fears of some commonwealth countries that our membership of the Community would in some way loosenexisting Commonwealth ties and so impair the Commonwealth relationship. in short we shall have to begin by placing the issue in its broad political setting, andwe shall have to make it clear that for the United Kingdom this will be one of the historic moments of decision a decision which, as the Common wealth generallyhas recognised, will be for the United Kingdom alone to take.2. I would hope that we could convince, most Commonwealth Governmentsof the strength of the political case. At least we must make sure that they are left in no doubt of the great significance which we attach to it. I need not develop this line of thought further since it will be dealt with in the briefs for the Conference. .3. Our second objective would relate to the economic aspects the implications of United Kingdom membership for individual commonwealth countries. We should seek to convince the Prime Ministers that on the whole theprovisional arrangements which have been agreed in Brussels, and: thearrangements which we hope to agree in the next phase of the negotiations, wouldsafeguard the vital interests of individual Commonwealth countries. We are onstrong ground in urging this view on India, Pakistan and Ceylon, and on thecountries in Africa and the Caribbean for which association with the Community---with its substantial economic benefits-is available, if they so desire. We shall probably have more difficulty with Canada, Australia and New Zealand, partly because a number of questions of considerable importance to them has not yet been settled, mind partly because the arrangements for temperate agricultural productsare not sufficiently precise to enable them to calculate the exact effects On their trade.For these reasons we cannot expect at this stage a final and considered judgmentfrom the old Commonwealth and probably not from the other commonwealth countries either but we should try to secure from them either in individual or ingroup discussions acceptance of the view that the provisional, or prospective,arrangements are on the whole reasonable, particularly when compared, as theyshould be, not with the position as it is, but as it is likely to be in the future if wedo not join the Community.4. In all this the element of confidence will play an important part. the six are beginning to learn no doubt slowly and painfully to have confidence ineach other. We ourselves will have to learn to have confidence in the Community,and we must hope that the Commonwealth too will come to learn not only thatour membership is better for them and for the world, but also to have confidence in us to do everything in our power, as members of the Community, to safeguardtheir vital interests. Above all, we must urge individual Prime Ministers to approach these issues not from the point of view of the &quot; nicely calculated less ormore &quot;, but with the broadest political judgment.   .E.
