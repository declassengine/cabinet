(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(62) 101 COPY NO. j;_CABINETKENYA: JLAND SgTJTLEMjENT^Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies at their meeting on 30th March the Cabinet noted that I would discuss with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, a programme for the settle-ment of Africans or. land to be purchased from Europeans in Kenya(C. C. (62) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 4).2.        Since then the Colonial Office have been discussing proposals with the Treasury.   There has also been consultation with Kenya officialsalthough this has been inhibited to some extent by the fact that nothingpositive can yet be said to African Ministers.   Proposals to the following effect have been put to the Treasury:-(i) Funds should be made available over the next five years for the settlement of one million acres of European mixedfarming land by approximately 70, 000 African families,(ii) Her Majesty s Government should indicate their willingness to participate in an extension of the scheme at the endof this period, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.3.        The rate of settlement would be 200,000 acres per year.   this does not include the scheme now being assisted by the international bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Colonial development corporation (C. D. C. ).   I think it is essential that these schemes shouldcontinue, and I would hope to negotiate with the Bank and the C. D. C. to adjust the rate of settlement in these schemes so as to co-ordinate themwith the schemes envisaged in my proposals.    At the same time theadministrative capacity of the Kenya authorities to implement theschemes is a very real limiting factor, and I do not believe that it wouldbe physically possible, with the resources likely to be available, for morethan this to be undertaken.   The total cost of buying and settling one million acres would be about  16.55 million which would be spread evenlyover five years.   I propose that  7. 55 million of this should be grant and  9.0 million loan.   For estimating purposes these figures are based on an average price of  10 per acre,    but the basis of valuationto be adopted in any scheme will have to be&apos; further considered.   The total amount of additional money required would be about  12.65 million, sincefunds already made available for some of the existing schemes would be absorbed into the new one.    The rate of expenditure on these existing schemes was to be  2 million (grant) and  2.1 million (loan) in the twoyears ending on 30th June, 1963.      This rate of expenditure has not been-1-CONFSDENT5AL
achieved, because of delays in getting the schemes under way, and though we do not yet know how much of the grant or of the loan has been spent it is possible that, as a result of applying the balance from the oldschemes to the new scheme, relatively little additional money will haveto be made available during its first year, even though the rate of expendi-ture should certainly increase.4.        The replacement of European farmers by Africans will adversely affect Kenya&apos;s recurrent revenues.     The effect cannot be preciselyestimated, but income tax derives almost entirely from the european community and currently produces  10 million a year.   Some of this wouldbe lost, and there would also be a fall in revenue from import duties,which at x^resent produce  15 million a year.   However, we cannot assume that if a scheme on the lines set out above is not introduced, the Europeanswill stay and continue to produce revenue.   If they were to withdraw inorder to &quot;cut their losses&quot; the effect on Kenya&apos;s revenues would becatastrophic,    and the financial consequences for Her Majesty1 s Governmentvery serious indeed, since we should be faced with the well-nigh in-escapable necessity of supporting the -Kenya economy and budget fromcollapse.5.        A scheme of this order would not resettle all the landlessunemployed Africans, nor would it involve the purchase of anything likethe whole of the vulnerable European mixed farming area.   If thoseEuropeans whose farms cannot be bought for settlement during the fiveyears are to be persuaded to stay, and if we are to be able to withstandAfrican pressure for a much higher rate of resettlement, there must bean assurance of the continuing interest of Her Majesty&apos;s government after the five year period.   It is for this   reason that I attach importanceto this element in my proposals.6.        I am to visit Kenya between 5th and 11th July.   I must say some-thing on this question, about which proposals were put to me by representatives of the Europeans last March, during the constitutional conference.   On the other hand, the general lines of an enlarged schemehave yet to be worked out between the Colonial Office and the Treasury,and the details will then have to be worked out with the Kenya Government,I therefore seek agreement to discussing proposals on these lines withthe Council of Ministers of the Kenya Government and to my makinga statement, during my visit, on the following lines:-(i) Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared  n principle to makefunds available to the Kenya Government to enable them to carry out a scheme for accelerating the settlement of Africans on mixed farmsin the scheduled areas.(ii) Detailed proposals must be worked out in consultation with the kenya Government and will have to be related to the existing schemes.Until this has been done it is impossible to say definitely how many-families can be settled or what acreage of land will be required for thepurpose.   Subject however to availability of financial and administrativeresources what I have in mind is a five-year scheme which might,with existing schemes, involve the settlement of about one million acres.-2-CONF3DENT3AL
CONF1DENTSALI cannot at present enter into any commitment as to the amount ofadditional finance to be contributed by Ker Majesty&apos;s Government to the kenya Government for this purpose, but I have agreed with the Kenya government that this scheme will be the first priority fox Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s assistance towards Kenya&apos;s development programme overthe period of the scheme.(iii) The new scheme would be reviewed during its final year and,subject to satisfactory progress having been made, and to their being satisfied that a further settlement scheme was necessary and acceptable to the Kenya Government of the day, the British Government would nodoubt be prepared, in principle, to consider participating in a furtherscheme in the light of financial circumstances at the time.7.        This proposal has been discussed with the Treasury.R.M.Colonial Office, S. W.T.3rd July, 1962-3-
