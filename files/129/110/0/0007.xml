CONFIDENTIAL3ANNEXECONOMIC GROWTHNote by the Chairman of the Economic Steering (Development) CommitteeThe attached paper puts to Ministers some of the problems following the firstsubstantive meeting of the National Economic Development Council. The questionis the attitude of Ministers to &quot; growth &quot;.^ 2. We must make it clear that it is a formidable problem to bring about byGovernmental action even a small increase in the rate of growth of productivity,involving major reorientation of policy.3. The paper sets out the considerations about &quot; growth policy &quot;. We would emphasise three points:(i) There are great dangers in becoming committed to expectations of growthor targets for growth without appreciation of the magnitude of thetask or of the radical changes of Government policy which would be involved in meeting such expectations.(ii) It may be difficult for the Government, given the increasing interest in&quot; growth &quot; and particularly in view of the Common Market, to sustaina policy of &quot; waiting for Neddy &quot;, especially as there is no reason to suppose that the end-year report by the Director General of theNational Economic Development Council, Sir Robert Shone, willprovide ready answers to any of these problems, or propositionsacceptable to the Government and both sides of industry, which wouldbe likely to lead to speedy and effective action.(iii) The positive idea of &quot; growth &quot; is a valuable means of presenting manypolitically difficult decisions, emphasising that such decisions are a means to enrich people and not to impoverish them.4. We think Ministers may find it best to keep in mind the kind of measuresindicated in paragraph 7 of the paper as the typical action required to improve theprospects of growth; take such action where this is practicable; and in particularrefrain from taking action which, while perhaps politically attractive, would infact be inimical to the attainment of faster growth.(Signed)F. G. LEE.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.5th June, 1962.
AppendixECONOMIC GROWTHMinisters will wish to take stock following the meeting of the national economic Development Council (N.E.D.C.). Sir Robert Shone and his staff are now engaged in preparing their report on the implications of a 4 per cent,per annum rate of growth of Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) from 1961-66.This report will come before the Council at the end of this year.The 4 per cent, per annum Rate of Growth2. The significance of the 4 per cent, per annum figure was defined by sir robert Shone as follows :&quot; In considering what rate of growth should be assumed as a basis forour enquiries, it is important to fix a reasonably ambitious figure. This wouldnot be a forecast, but a figure that would be likely to bring out the problems that have to be tackled in securing faster growth. On the other hand, the specified figure should not be so high that it would be likely to revealbottlenecks all along the line.&quot;3. He described the arithmetic behind the 4 per cent, per annum (or nearly22 per cent, from 1961-66) in the following terms:&quot; A rate of growth of 4 per cent, per annum in total output over the whole period 1961-66 would probably imply an average growth of about 3-3 percent, per annum in G.D.P. per worker, because of the growth of the labour force. Since the present underlying rate of growth of output per worker is substantially lower than 3 - 3 per cent., such an average would imply workingup to a rate well in excess of this figure, probably to about 4 per cent, perworker at the end of the period.These figures are substantially higher than long-run rates of growth of output per worker in the past. The rate was probably about \\ per cent.,both in the fifty or sixty years before the first World war and in the interwaryears. In the 1950s as a whole it was about 2 per cent, although there is some evidence that in recent years the underlying rate of increase has beenimproving ... A growth of 3 - 3 per cent, in output per worker is higher thanthe comparable target for the countries of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development as a whole.&quot;The Implications of 4 per cent, per annum4. No real assessment can be made of what is involved in a rate of growth of 4 per cent, per annum before Sir Robert Shone&apos;s report has been completed.It would represent so great a change from anything that has happened in the pastthat there is no reasonable basis for statistical projections. The discussions with industry are the essential element in Sir Robert Shone&apos;s work, and there is notechnical short cut to the answers.5. The following points may however be regarded as reasonably well established:(i) If the figure of 4 per cent, per annum increase in G.D.P. means, as sir Robert Shone&apos;s paper says, an increase of G.D.P. per workerfrom an average of 2 per cent, per annum in the 1950s to a growth ofover 4 per cent, per annum by 1965 and 1966, this is a large andunprecedented peacetime change in the British (or any other) economy.(ii) There is no reason to suppose that a change of these dimensions canhappen simply on its own, without purposeful action by theGovernment, with the full support of both sides of industry.(iii) There is likely to be an important balance of payments problem, for a growth of exports of goods will be required far in excess of the recentaverage rate of increase, which has been per cent, per annum. Theimprovement of our competitive position is a pre-condition off first-class importance.
(iv) There will probably be important industrial bottlenecks, e.g., the supplyof electric power.(v) An essential problem is that of the time taken to make the radical changesin Governmental and industrial attitudes and policies that would benecessary to bring about this increased rate of growth. There is a decisive difference between achieving a rate of 4 per cent, per annumincrease in G.D.P. by the year 1966, and achieving an average of4 per cent, per annum in the period 1961-66.Changes in policy. Great changes in Government policy and in business attitudes would berequired to achieve a marked increase in the rate of growth. There is some reasonto believe that there has been some acceleration in recent years, but not enough tobring us within reach of the N.E.D.C. figures.7. The most important change would be to regard economic growth as themost important desideratum in every economic and social problem which comesbefore the Government. This would imply that the Government would do everything within their power to speed up the process of economic change, andto shift resources as quickly as possible from low-productivity to high-productivityactivities, both in manufacturing industry and in services. This would involve,for example:(i) Improving the supply of skilled labour and management.(ii) Substantial withdrawal of labour from mining and railways  (and continuing withdrawal from agriculture) and retraining for otherindustries.(iii) Easing of redeployment of labour.(iv) Further relaxation of rent control, and other housing measures, toincrease labour mobility.(v) Fiscal and other policies designed to reward enterprising and efficientfirms and to encourage economy in the use of labour.(vi) Sharpening competition wherever possible, in industry, distribution, etc.(vii) Not giving subsidies or other assistance to bolster up non-economicproduction.(viii) &quot; Economic &quot; rather than &quot; social &quot; decisions in investment and price policy in nationalised industry.(ix) Creating an atmosphere in industry favourable to rapid industrialinnovation.8. The more effective the action under these heads, the better for the rateof growth. These specific growth policies will not solve the problem unless theyare supported by the right general economic policies, notably:(i) Effective incomes policy for if our costs are rising faster than our competitors, we shall not develop the increased competitive power which is indispensable to the whole programme.(ii) Maintaining a pressure of demand that does not lead to inflationaryshortages of labour or to excessive imports and which gives properincentives to develop export markets.(iii) Moderation of growth of public expenditure (except where this isspecifically directed to increasing productivity and accelerating economicchange): the rate of increase in the last two years, if sustained in thenext period (which seems highly probable), would be likely to be damaging to growth.9. As the work of the N.E.D.C. takes shape, there may well be developments of industrial programming which will be advantageous, over a long period, buthowever this develops, it cannot be a substitute for these three basic elements ofgeneral policy, and a range of specific policies designed to take every opportunityto speed up the process of economic change.
A Policy for Growth10. The Government are faced with many of these problems in any event.There can be no viability for the economy without a successful incomes policyand without a sound policy on pressure of demand. The growth of public expenditure is going forward at such a pace that the future growth of revenueis already hypothecated to provide for existing policies, apart altogether from new expansive ones. Ministers have already before them, or will have in thecoming weeks, decisions on resale price maintenance, industrial training, subsidyproposals, the reorganisation of the coal and railway industries, etc. All theseare highly germane to the problem of growth.11. The Government are being asked, and will continue to be asked in thecoming months:(i) What is the Governments policy for improving our competitiveness and ability to survive economically in the Common Market?(ii) What is the Governments policy for growth?   Are the Governmentjust &quot; waiting for Neddy &quot; knowing that there can be no decisivediscussion in N.E.D.C. before Christmas, and that many months willelapse after that before any practical policy can emerge?12. One line of policy would be to &quot; wait for Neddy &quot;; to take ad hoc such decisions in this field as require to be taken, and not to emphasise growth as aGovernmental objective, deliberately playing it slowly in the hope of being able in the end to bring industry along more effectively if N.E.D.C. is kept in the lead.13. The other line of policy would be to develop an attitude and policy for growth on the lines indicated above, and to decide and present individual problemsagainst this background. There is no reason to suppose that this would be resented by N.E.D.C., for it would in no sense prejudice action on Sir RobertShone&apos;s report when it was available indeed it would facilitate such action, forthe Government would have adopted a posture in which the problems propoundedby Sir Robert Shone could find answers.14. An advantage of this latter course is that it would provide a backgroundin which the unpopular elements in the Governments policies, notably the incomes policy but also unpopular decisions in public expenditure and in specific industrialquestions, could be justified and offset by the attractions for the public as a wholeof a successful performance in economic growth, which in a few years could makea substantial impact on the standard of living.15. The policy that would seem certain to lead to considerable difficulty would be for the Government to become committed to &quot; targets &quot; of economic growth without having the growth policies which provide the only justification for framing such targets.16. The point is put to Ministers at this stage, because there is likely to be something of a vacuum between now and the end of the year, while Sir RobertShone is preparing his report, and Ministers will wish to use this to the best advantage, either by setting on foot the preparation of Governmental policiesdesigned to enable effective action to follow the appearance of Sir Robert Shone&apos;sreport or by setting their wider economic policies, particularly incomes policy,in a context of economic growth.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th June, 1962.
