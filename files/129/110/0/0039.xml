NATIONAL INCOMES commission memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we cannot claim that the National Incomes Commission (N. I. C.) hashad a very enthusiastic reception.    The Trades Union Congress (T. U. C.),led by their General-Secretary, Mr. Woodcock, have been violentlyhostile;  the employers have been interested and receptive, but they havebeen fairly guarded.    The Press on the whole has recognised the needfor something, but they have been sceptical about N. I. C. and increasinglydoubtful whether it will in practice succeed in the light of T. U. C.opposition.2.     I have myself no doubt that we should proceed on the lines we haveplanned, and I will inform my colleagues orally of the position reachedabout a possible chairman.    Despite the criticism that has been aimed atN. I. C. , no-one has produced a better alternative or indeed anyreasonably satisfactory alternative.3.     In fact it could be said that recent events have made the need forN. I. C. even more clear.    The T. U. C. have agreed to support theNational Economic Development Council (N. E. D, C.) and have concededthat wages are a suitable subject for discussion by that body.    But general discussion without practical application is valueless.    Whatever theGovernment decide, on N. E. D. C&apos;s advice, about the appropriate level for incomes must somehow be translated into practical terms in individual cases.    This is what N. I. C. is designed to do.    Neither theT. U. C. nor anyone else has produced an alternative suggestion.    Theproblem is too urgent to brook delay, as the extent and pace at which wecan foster economic growth depends upon the degree of confidence we have in containing the growth of incomes.4.      The award to the nurses is another example.    The IndustrialCourfs findings have been generally welcomed with a sigh of relief.Even from our point of view they could have been much worse and now,at any rate, we are off the hook.    It is apparent that our incomes policy permits exceptions.    The great problem is to ensure that the exceptions remain exceptions.    The l\ per cent for the nurses is notin itself harmful, but it must be crystal clear that if it becomes a precedent for industry generally, great harm will follow.    once again this underlines the need for a body that can both make exceptionsand declare them to be exceptions.12th September, 1962CABINET
5.     The recent rejection of two Civil Service claims shows that an impartial body can take a firm line.    If the rejection of the CivilService claims and the granting of the 7j per cent to the nurses had beenthe work of the same body of men the result would have been even more satisfactory, and the people concerned would have less reason to feelthat their treatment was arbitrary.6.     So I conclude that the case for N. I. C. has been strengthened by recent events and that we should declare our decision to press on with its establishment.    The one argument advanced by the T. U. C.which is likely to command public sympathy is the claim that N. I. C. is designed solely to restrain wages and salaries.    As usual there is someelement of truth in the argument.    Wages and salaries are quantitivelyby far the most important factor in cost inflation and simultaneously theleast susceptible to control by the Government.     That is why in shapingN. I. C. emphasis has been laid on wage settlements.    But we have repeatedly stated that an incomes policy must cover all forms of income and that what is fair for one section of the community must equally be fair for others.    If we are to secure the maximum support for N. I. C.we must make this principle a little more clear in their terms ofreference.7.     Of course it is true that there are many differences betweenwages and salaries on the one hand and profits and dividends on theother.    Wages always go up, profits sometimes come down.    wages are fixed in advance, profits are determined after the event.    wages are now fixed at a common level for an entire industry or occupation,profits should never be consistent.    In fact the margin of profitabilitybetween the efficient and the inefficient should be as wide as possible.But taking all this into account, it is still in my view desirable to makeit clear that N. I. C, is not specially directed at wages and salaries.8.     The purpose of N. I. C. will be, as I have said, to translategeneral principles into particular terms.    There are three reasons why this is necessary and why it cannot be left to be determined bymarket conditions.    In the first place large unions enjoy a monopolyposition which they can exploit.    In the second place, wage increases in one industry inevitably stimulate comparable increases in otherindustries.    In the third place, people with strong moral claims butweak bargaining power tend to get left behind.    The same considera-tions do not apply to profits and dividends.    High profits and dividendsin one industry do not lead to high profits and dividends in another.Comparability does not apply here.    In the second place, it isgenerally desirable that the stronger industries should make higherprofits and the weaker industries lower profits.    To this extent,therefore, we should be able to rely on the normal working of the economy to ensure that particular industries do not do too well at theexpense of other people.    So far as profits and dividends in generalare concerned, we have the advice of N. E. D. C. and we do not need the advice of N. I. C.    But there does remain the case where for one reason or another particular industries may consistently enjoy higherprofits and dividends without proper economic justification.    In
these circumstances it would be reasonable to say that the national incomes policy as a whole was being jeopardised and that investigation by N. I. C. would be justified.    I suggest, therefore, that we shouldmake it clear that the Government will be able to refer to N. I. C. forconsideration and advice the circumstances of an industry which isconsistently increasing its profit and dividend record by more than the increases of national productivity, and where there is reason tobelieve that such increase may be running contrary to the national incomes policy as a whole, which will have been determined by theGovernment after receiving the advice of N. E. D. C.    In other words, theGovernments economic and taxation policy should ensure that theaverage increase of profits and dividends is not out of line with thenational incororj.es policy.    Within this general increase the fortunes of individual industries should depend upon their competitive efficiency.But where there is reason to suppose that an unusually high degree of prosperity depends not on competitive efficiency but, as in the case ofpowerful unions, upon the exploitation of a special position, theninvestigation is necessary and N. I. C. is the proper body.9.     I do not think this will make much practical difference.    in industries earning unusually high profits there are bound to be eitherlarge wage claims or large settlements, and N. I. C. would therefore inall probability be brought in.    But the psychological difference might be considerable.     &quot;vVe could then say that the Government will have a policy on incomes generally, including wages, profits and dividends.    in formulating this policy we will take into account the advice of N. E. D. C. ,and the T. U. C. have agreed that N. E. D. C. should thrash out these problems.    Having settled a general policy, we need an instrument totranslate it into particular cases.    Whatever form of income is involved N. I. C. will be our main instrument.    In normal cases the mechanism of a free market and the pressure of competition will safe-guard the public interest.    But the danger is the exploitation of monopoly strength either by capital or by labour.    It is this exploitationthat can damage the jmblic interest and, in particular, harm the people whose bargaining strength, for one reason or another, is less than thatof the big battalions.    Thus N. I. C. will be a protection not only for thepublic interest at large but for minorities as well, and it will functionover the whole field of personal incomes as is appropriate in eachcategory without discrimination.10.    If we make it clear that this is our concept of N, I. C. , I think wecan proceed with confidence that, though the T. U. C, will continue to criticise, the only apparent moral basis for their criticism will have dissapeared.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.11th September, 1962.
