^ CONFIDfteNTfAt.&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1962C. (62) 132 Copy No!   6620th August, 1962CABINETCONGO-Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my Memorandum of 2nd July to the Oversea Policy Committee, I mentioned the approach which had been received from the United,, States Governmentsuggesting that those countries which trade with the Congo.should contributeimmediate short-term aid to meet the deficit in the Congolese,balance of payments of $15 million a month. They had invited the ,United Kingdom, to, pay $4 million over a period of three months. I recommended in this connexion that theopportunity should be taken of the visit of the Secretary-General of the, united nations to this country to tell. U Thant that, HerMajestyS, Government saw no possibility of bringing about a satisfactory settlement of the&quot; Katanga problem by force. We should seek to convince him that to proceed by negotiation was theonly possible way and that, provided they were really prepared to. reach agreement in the near future, both sides should be offered the inducement of economic assistance. The United Nations operation should Increasinglybe converted intoa long-term economic plan designed to restore the economy of the Congo. I realiseall the difficulties but to pay is better than war.2. At their meeting on 3rd July, the Oversea.. Policy Committee invited meto explore, without commitment, U Thant&apos;s.. attitude! to the idea of -economic aid for the Congo; and invited the. Chief Secretary, Treasury,^. ..ppn^ultation withmyself, to arrange for an examination by officials of the implicatiops of the UnitedKingdom taking part in a consortium to give financial aid to the Congo.3. In the event, the Secretary-General did not respond.very positively tothe suggestion of relyingupon economic &quot;aid, though he agreed generally that theUnited Nations should seek to transform its effort into one of economic andtechnical &quot;assistance.... A considerable measure of agreement has, however, beenreached between Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos; andthe Governments of the UnitedStates, Belgium and France on the essential elements of, any settlement in the congo likely to be accepted by both sides.  These elements are:(a) Agreement,in principle by the Central Government to a federal form of constitution, the. details to be worked out by the Central,Governmentwith the provinces with the assistance of the United Nations.(b) Agreement in principle on a fair division, of the revenues between theprovinces and the Central Government.      . .......    ,;; u- Ua iH-,j(c) An international plan for the reconstruction of the Congo, which wouldhave to be supervised by an international body, staffed by the United -Nations, and the International Monetary Fund, to control budgetaryexpenditure and foreign exchange.   This would., inevitably involve,as at present, a considerable measure of economic and technical aid.4.   Discussion in Washington. between the Americans, i Belgians and French, jand ourselves have resulted in a new.&quot; Proposal for National.Reconciliation &quot; -which-:.ait is proposed should be launched in the near future, by the.. United Nations -withy.;the support of Governments.   The Americans have undertaken in the context
of this plan to make available additional aid to the Congo and have enquire whether we are prepared to do the same. The Belgians are also considering thequestion and it is likely that we shall soon be pressed to make clear our position.5. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, has stated that there is no strongcommercial case for providing financial aid to the Congo, on the score of protectingBritish trade and investments. However, these latter, not only in the Katanga,but also in the rest of the Congo, estimated at  30 million are far from negligibleand,if economic recovery can be achieved in the country they might grow. I accept however that the main arguments in favour of our participation in a long-term plan are political.  They can be summarised as follows:(a) It is a major British interest to promote an early settlement in the Congoto enable the United Nations operation to be honourably concluded.If the present stalemate cannot be broken, there is a great risk that before long, perhaps by the end of the year, the United Nations will decide to fight because if it does not go for a quick win it would be forced by financial weakness to withdraw. This would remove the chance of Congolese stability and economic recovery for the foreseeable future and give full opportunity to the centrifugal forces in the Congo,which would probably bring the country quickly into chaos. Thiswould not only be dangerous for the surrounding territories andparticularly the Central African Federation, but also provide a goldenopportunity for the Soviet bloc to resume its effort of penetration whichwas thwarted two years ago with the ousting of Mr. Lumumba andthe restoration of order by the United Nations. The sooner that asettlement can be reached, the sooner the United Nations can get rid of the expensive commitment of maintaining substantial forces in the congo and devote its attention to economic and technical assistance,which will undoubtedly be needed for some years to come.(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Government at present find themselves in a situation ofsome isolation over the Congo since we are opposed to the impositionof economic sanctions which might result in further fighting and destruction.(c) The belief in the United Nations that, by opposing the exertion of what other countries consider as effective pressure on Mr. Tshombe, weare insincere in our desire to reintegrate Katanga into the Congo andare actuated not only by material considerations but by pressures fromthe Central African Federation, tends to increase our difficulties in handling the problem of Southern Rhodesia in the United Nations.Pressure on us in the United Nations at the next Assembly over thelatter subject is likely to be even stronger than earlier this year andwe shall find less sympathy for oUr case even among our traditionalfriends. A readiness to contribute finance to a long-term plan forthe Congo would be an effective way of showing our sincerity in working for the unity of the Congo and reducing the risk of these two questions interacting to our disadvantage. It should also strengthen our tactical position, should the Congo question be raised again inthe Security Council or the Assembly. Our ability to restrain theUnited Nations from taking action that would make matters worse willbe increased if we are able to show willingness to take part in a positiveand constructive effort to restore the stability and viability of the Congoas a whole. Such an effort is much to be preferred to methods of pressure that could result in renewed fighting.6. Apart from the above considerations, we have also to take into account the need to protect British investments in the Congo.Conclusions7. (a) I would not suggest that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should make a contribution to the short-term assistance proposed by the Americans, except aspart of a longer-term plan which could be expected to lead to a political settlement.The implementation of such a plan would have to be subject to international control in order to ensure that the resources of the Congo were managed prudentlyand used for the benefit of the country as a whole.   I recommend that Her
Foreign Office, S.W.1,20th August, 1962.mwtulotuMajesty&apos;s Government should indicate their willingness in principle to subscribe toan assistance programme as part of a package proposal on the lines indicated inparagraphs 3 and 4 above. It is very difficult to say how much money might berequired, and for how long. We have seen a report from American sources thatthey are thinking in terms of a sum of $500 million over a period of three or fouryears. On the basis of United Nations contributions, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsshare in such a plan might be of the order of $10 million a year. This compares with the $9 million which we are already contributing to United Nations militaryand &quot;administrative expenditure in the Congo. I suggest that we should indicate to the Americans and to the United Nations that we should be prepared tocontribute a sum of that magnitude annually over a period of say four years5towards a programme of economic reconstruction, once the present United Nationsmilitary effort has been wound up.(b) As regards short-term aid, I referred in my earlier paper to the fact thatin 1961 we had made an offer of $2 million as an additional contribution to theSecretary-GeneraFs Civil Assistance Fund. I recommend that we should beprepared to contribute this amount in short-term assistance, subject to adequate control and to the presentation by the United Nations to both sides of a plan fora settlement of which we can approve. The short-term contribution would beessentially to cover the transitional period needed to enable the plan to be appliedand the United Nations military effort converted into one of reconstruction. Weshould in addition seek to obtain a commercial credit of similar size from thelarge companies trading with the Congo.recommendation.   To sum up, I recommend:(a) that provided that a long-term reconstruction plan is worked out for the congo offering the prospect of a stable political settlement, we should indicate our readiness to contribute $2 million in short-term aid (thesum conditionally offered to the Secretary-General&apos;s Civil AssistanceFund in 1960) and to seek a commercial credit of similar size frombusiness firms.(b) that we should be prepared to contribute to a long-term plan a similar sum to that which we are now contributing to the United nations organisation in the Congo, i.e., about $10 million a year over say fouryears, on the assurance that the United Nations effort will be convertedas soon as possible from a military operation to a programme ofeconomic rehabilitation.H.
