(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(62) 142 COPY NO. -6jVCABINETFARM IMPROVEMENT scheme memorandum by the J?hie^SecretcirYto the JT rea suryand Paymaster-GeneralThe Minister of Agriculture&apos;s paper C. (62) 141 might be read as suggesting that the question of the rate of grant to be paid in futureunder the Farm Improvement Scheme was the only matter with whichthe meeting of Ministers to which he refers was concerned.     In fact the decision on the rate of grant under this Scheme was part of a&quot;package deal&quot; under which my predecessor reluctantly agreed thatthe Farm Improvement Scheme was to be continued and a further 35 million provided for that purpose, and under which powers wereto be taken to continue the hill sheep and hill cattle subsidies andthe livestock rearing land improvements grants.    It is worth notingthat the minute of the meeting presided over by the First Secretaryof State contains the statement:   &quot;In discussion there was generalagreement that the rate of grant would have to be reduced to 25 per centif the Scheme were to continue&quot;.Z.      Treasury Ministers have never had any great enthusiasm forthis Scheme and their original view was that no money beyond theoriginal  55 million should be provided for it.    By indiscriminatelyincreasing capacity it has worked to increase the quantity ofagricultural production at mounting cost to the Exchequer.    Inaddition, a 33-5- per cent rate of grant in practice caused a more rapid take-up of grant than had been expected, owing no doubt to thevery generous nature of a provision at this rate.    This aspect ofthe matter, and the disproportionate call on investment capitalwhich had resulted, was fully discussed by those directly concernedin April, and no doubt was the basis on which the views quoted atthe end of the preceding paragraph were formed.3.      Nonetheless my predecessor, after discussion, agreed to a compromise on the lines outlined above.     It is this compromise which the Minister of Agriculture now seeks to upset.4,      He seeks to do so on the grounds (a) that the common market situation makes it much,more difficult to announce the newrate of grant:   (b) that this particular subsidy would be permitted to continue if we enter the Common Market and that, therefore,greater emphasis must be placed on it.-1-
5.     As to (a), I would not have thought it was unduly difficult to announce that we were going to find another  35 million even if itis to be applied on a 25 per cent basis.      On (b), 1 think that theCommon Market argument is misconceived.    In the first place Ido not share the Minister&apos;s view that this is a subsidy which, ifwe enter the Common Market, we shall be able to maintain if we want.    Its non-selective and general nature - it could be criticised as a general subsidy to agricultural production of all kinds and byall men - raises at least considerable doubt on this point.    Apartfrom this, if we are to review agricultural subsidies as they mightbe under Common Market rules, we shall plainly have to go a greatdeal further than just to give consideration to the percentage rateapplicable to this particular one.    It is clear that when we knowmore about both the time-table and the conditions of agricultural support under the Common Market, a complete review ofagricultural subsidies will have to be urgently undertaken.6.      I am prepared to abide by the arrangements agreed by my predecessor.     Eut if these are to be re-opened on Common Marketgrounds at this stage there is much to be said for including no provision for extending the Farm Improvement Scheme in the agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.    I understand thatthe money at present available under the present Act would, subjectto the making of a Statutory Instrument to cover the final 5 million, last at least until June, 1963.     By then we should havea much clearer view as to what legislation is likely to be necessary on the whole subject of agricultural subsidies and would have had some opportunity to consider them, and their cost, as a whole.7.      The proposal contained in paragraph 6 of the Minister&apos;s paper to increase the capital to be provided under the farm improvement Scheme from the  35 million agreed in April to atotal of  50 million has not been discussed with the Treasury.     on general principle this further investment in agricultural improve-merits does not appear to be sound;  but as indicated above no casewhatever has so far been made for it.8.      It is material to our consideration of this matter that the overall cost of agricultural support is now running at an approximatefigure of  340 million a year - compared with  267 million only twoyears ago and that the cost of the current year&apos;s provision is nowrunning ahead of that anticipated after this year&apos;s Farm price review.J. A, B, -C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.19th September, 1962.-2-
