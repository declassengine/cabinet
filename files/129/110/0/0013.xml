Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 1139th July, 1962Copy No.50CABINETCOMMERCIAL TREATY WITH JAPAN: THE TREATY ARTICLESMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 7th June the Cabinet considered my proposals for therestrictions which it would be necessary to retain on imports of Japanese goodsafter the conclusion of a Commercial Treaty with Japan (C.C. (62) 40thConclusions, Minute 3). There are also some outstanding points on the Treatyitself. Officials of the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office will be going toTokyo next week to try to settle these with a view to our reaching substantial agreement with the Japanese on these and all other matters by the end of August.As I pointed out in my earlier paper (C. (62) 92) our own political and commercial interests require an early conclusion of these negotiations. The short-term tradearrangements which at present govern our trade relations with Japan aretroublesome and uncertain and are coming under increasing criticism from ourtraders who want a stable and permanent framework for developing their trade.Since the current Trade Agreement expires on 30th September, 1962, it is most desirable that the conclusion of the Treaty should be clearly in sight by the endof August. Moreover this would permit the Treaty to be signed in Novemberwhen the Japanese Prime Minister expects to visit Britain, if both sides so desire.My colleagues will wish to know of the instructions which I propose to give toour negotiators on the main matters still in issue.Treatment of Companies2. We proposed originally that the Treaty should give companies of both parties rights to national treatment in the territory of the other. We found,however, that in order to comply with their law the Japanese would have to makeconsiderable reservations, and in certain respects they wished to be free to extendthese even beyond the requirements of their present law. Their reservationsrelate mainly to restrictions on the right of British companies to engage in shipbuilding, air and water transport, banking, public utility enterprises and the exploitation of land or other natural resources. They also wish to be free tocontrol the introduction of capital and know-how into Japan and to deny thebenefits of the Treaty to British companies not controlled by British nationals.We do not need such extensive reservations for national treatment on our side and, rather than accept them, we have proposed that the Treaty should confermost-favoured-nation treatment only; this would not, of course, remove therestrictions which the Japanese place on pur companies&apos; activities but would makeit unnecessary for us to recognise most of them explicity in the Treaty. TheJapanese are strongly opposed to this solution because it would result in ourobtaining national treatment (subject to the exceptions mentioned) by virtue oftheir Treaty with the United States, which confers national treatment, whereasJapanese companies in this country would not be entitled to national treatmentsince we have no other treaty which confers it. Moreover, we make substantialexceptions from our most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of theCommonwealth, the European Free Trade Association and, if we join it, theEuropean Economic Community.3. I propose that we should nevertheless stand firm on the exchange of most-favoured-nation treatment for companies. If this leads to deadlock, our negotiators should ascertain what modifications of the Japanese reservations to
national treatment and what concessions in other directions the Japanese wouldbe willing to make if we could agree to national treatment on the lines they desire,and should refer back for further instructions so that we can decide, afterreviewing the balance of advantages over the Treaty as a whole, whether or not it is worthwhile to give way on this point.Shipping4. The navigation articles provide generally that each country&apos;s ships shallhave full freedom to compete and be treated as well in all respects as ships of theother country or of any third country. We originally sought also to obtain a specific undertaking that neither country would enter into any agreements (withthird parties) which would have the effect of preventing the other country&apos;s ships from freely competing. The Japanese are unable to accept the specific undertakingbecause they think that they may be compelled to enter into cargo-sharingagreements with other countries, particularly -in South-East Asia, which practiceflag discrimination, and our own shipping interests themselves also now feel thatit might be better not to tie our hands too firmly in this matter. Our shippinginterests accept that a reasonable solution would be to drop the specific undertaking and try to get on the record, perhaps in the form of an agreed minute the substance of which could be publicly mentioned, a statement that complete freedom of opportunity for ships of all flags was the common objective, a recognition thatnevertheless in some cases the need to negotiate with countries practisingdiscriminatory policies might make it impossible to observe this principle fully,and an undertaking by the parties to continue close liaison on shipping matters.This would have the value of pledging both countries to the right principles, while leaving a certain amount of flexibility in practice.5. A somewhat similar situation has arisen on financial assistance to shipping.TheJapanese wish to be assured that the general undertaking to give equal treatment in all matters will not preclude either side from giving financial assistance and have asked for an agreed minute on these lines. As we ourselves help our shipping byexceptional investment allowances and may possibly wish to go further, we cannotrefuse this, though we should wish the minute to require that help should be confined to a reasonable scale.6. Finally, we have sought to get a specific undertaking in the Treaty itselfthat shipping remittances would be freely allowed. The Japanese have now accepted a provision that exchange restrictions should not be applied in such a manner as to hinder the use by one country of the other country&apos;s shipping. Butthis is qualified by a general exemption from the Treaty covering any action whicheither party is entitled to take as a member of the International Monetary Fund.This, of course, much reduces the value of the undertaking as long as Japan is in balance of payments difficulties. I am therefore instructing our negotiators tomake every attempt to obtain the removal of this qualification so far as shippingremittances are concerned in exchange for a settlement of the other two outstanding issues on the lines indicated above.Colonies7. In our draft of the Treaty we have included the clause, common to all our relevant treaties and conventions, allowing us unilaterally to extend the treaty to any Colony at or after the time we ratify. (This allows us to ratify while someColonies may be still considering whether they can and should accede.) If we wishto extend the Treaty to a Colony subject to modifications, these have to be agreed with the Japanese. The Japanese want also to reserve the right to requiremodifications on extension and these would have to be agreed with us. On the face of it, this right does no more than balance ours. But in theory it would, of course,allow the Japanese to veto extension to any particular Colony by requiringunacceptable modifications. All we know of their intentions is that they foreseedifficulty in the extension of the Treaty as it stands to Hong Kong.8. I propose that our negotiators should be authorised to accept that theJapanese should be free to suggest modifications provided we can obtain a reliableassurance that the modifications would be limited to those appropriate to theparticular circumstances of a territory and which we would regard as reasonablyacceptable to the territory concerned, including Hong Kong. If there is difficultyin obtaining this assurance, further consideration will be needed.  (The position of
the Colonies is in any case to a large extent safeguarded since, whether or not theyaccede to the Treaty, we shall be able to obtain for them full most-favoured-nationrights on tariffs and quotas in Japan under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GAIT) by simply disinvoking Article XXXV on their behalf.)9. The Colonies&apos; right to benefit under the General Safeguard is linked withthe question of accession. Hong Kong will in any case receive protection underthe Sensitive List safeguard since the List includes articles of considerable interestto her, in particular cotton textiles and plastic toys. But we have also sought toprovide that the General Safeguard could be applied if increased Japanese imports into Britain were to threaten serious injury to Colonial producers of competitivegoods. The Japanese have reacted strongly against this and are willing only toallow the safeguard protocol to be used in this way to protect &quot; traditional &quot;exports from the Colonies to the United Kingdom and then only from colonies which accede to the Treaty. &quot; Traditional &quot; has not been defined but clearly itwould at least mean that we would have no way of protecting new industries thatmight be developed in the Colonies with the United Kingdom market in mind afterthe Treaty comes into effect and might find Japanese competition here too fiercefor them. Such protection might well be valuable in securing much neededdiversification in Colonial territories and the establishment of new industries vital to their development. But, whether or not we accept the limitation to traditionalindustries, our power to provide protection would be limited, since the proposedsafeguard is against disruption and would therefore enable us only to protectColonial industries which had first established a market here in the face of japanese competition, and not to hold the ring open for industries that hoped toestablish such a market. Moreover, it remains to be seen how far in practiceJapanese competition in the United Kingdom during the firm life of the treaty and Safeguard, i.e., probably during the next five years, would hamper thedevelopment of new Colonial industries. I propose, therefore, that our negotiatorsshould be instructed to concentrate their efforts on getting the definition of&quot; traditional &quot; trade widened so as to cover all substantial trade existing whenthe Treaty comes into effect. As regards the limitation to acceding Colonies, thiswould be acceptable if we got a satisfactory assurance on the Japanese use of their right to require modifications (i.e., if we knew that in practice the Colonies wouldbe allowed to accede should they wish to do so). If we cannot get such an assurance, our negotiators should insist that all Colonies should be entitled to benefit under the safeguard.Duration10. The Japanese want the Treaty to run for an initial period of five yearsand then to continue at a year&apos;s notice. We have stood out for a longer initialduration, having at least seven years in mind. The importance of the initial period is that the Safeguards Protocol, which gives us the right to impose restrictions on japanese imports if they threaten to disrupt domestic industry (notwithstanding the GATT obligations which we shall assume when we withdraw our invocationof Article XXXV on the entry into force of the Treaty), will have the same durationas the Treaty. If, therefore, the Japanese were determined to end the Safeguardsprocedure they could do this by denouncing the whole Treaty as soon as they werefree to do so. Their Foreign Minister assured my predecessor last year that thiswould be a grave step which they would be most unlikely to take, but nevertheless the longer the initial period of duration the better for us. On the other hand theJapanese have always made it clear that they would not contemplate a longer period than five years, and I myself have never thought that we could bring themto agree to this. Moreover, if we join the European Economic Community we might run into complications with them if we committed ourselves for much morethan five years. I propose therefore that we should in the end agree to five yearsand should seek to use this concession to obtain satisfaction on some of our other requirements.11. None of the proposals in this paper call for new decisions from theCabinet. Those in paragraphs 4 to 9 have been agreed with the Departmentsconcerned.   I am therefore circulating this paper for my colleagues&apos; information.F. .T. E.Board of Trade, S.W.J.\ 6th July, 1962.
