Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 115 Copy No.   6 712th July, 1962CABINETTRUCK ACTSMemorandum by the Minister of LabourA Committee appointed to consider the Truck Acts in the light of presentconditions reported to me last year. The Committee, which includedrepresentatives of employers and trade unions, reported unanimously in favourof repeal of the Truck Acts and recommended new legislation to provide more limited safeguards adapted to modern conditions which would cover all employees and not only manual workers. A summary of the main recommendations is annexed. The Home Affairs Committee invited me to submit a memorandumabout the Governments view on the Committee&apos;s Report.2. The recommendations of the Committee were a compromise between theviews of employers and trade unions. Some employers would like to see the TruckActs repealed without any new legislation and will certainly not welcome theproposal that the new legislation should cover all their employees including theirmanagerial staff. The trade unions will only agree to repeal of the Truck Actsif there is new legislation to provide some safeguards for all employees. Theymay want the legislation to be rather stronger on some points than is recommended by the Committee, but they are likely to accept the general approachin the Report.3. We cannot accept some of the recommendations in the Report. TheCommittee recommend that the new legislation, unlike the Truck Acts, should cover all persons employed under a contract of service, including Crownemployees. It would be desirable that the law should not bind the Crown andthat other arrangements should be made to give equal protection to civil servants.It will be necessary also to ensure that the provisions about deductions from payin respect of cash shortages in local government service do not cut across thedistrict audit procedure. The suggestion made by the Committee that there shouldbe a right of appeal from local tribunals to the Court of Appeal is undesirableand provision for appeal to an umpire (as under the National Insurance Acts)more appropriate.4. Repeal of the Truck Acts and legislation on the lines proposed wouldmake it necessary to withdraw our ratification of International ConventionNo. 95 on the protection of wages which closely follows our Truck Acts. Wecould do this in the 12 months following 24th September, 1962, and should thenbe free a year after our withdrawal to institute changes.5. The Truck Acts are out of date. Repeal of the Acts and the substitution of up-to-date legislation is undoubtedly needed. This would be in line with ourwider plans for improving the status and security of all employed persons and,in particular, removing differences in status between manual workers and others.Manual workers no longer need the protection against the abuses which madethe Truck Acts necessary in the 19th century. These have now disappeared andin present day conditions the Acts work to the disadvantage of manual workersthis document is the property of her britannic majestvs government
since they hinder employers who wish to provide fringe benefits and set upsuperannuation schemes for them. The legislation proposed would remove thesehindrances and provide what protection is needed equally to all employed personswhether in manual or white collar employment.6. We should consult with a number of organisations including employers,trade unions, local authority associations, banks and insurance companies before we; finally decide on the details of legislation.7. I hope my colleagues will agree that I should now consult withinterested organisations on the practicability of legislation broadly on the lines recommended by the Committee.J. H.Ministry of Labour, S.W. /,10th July, 1962.annex the main recommendations of the Committee may be summarised as follows:(i) The Truck Acts, 1831-1940, should be repealed and replaced by legislationadapted to modern conditions. Unlike the Truck Acts, which apply only to those engaged in manual labour, the new legislation should cover all who are employed under a contract of service (includingCrown employees) except for merchant seamen if their special position under the Merchant Shipping Acts is to be maintained.(ii) Existing restrictions on the Payment of Wrfges otherwise than in cashshould be retained but not extended to any new categories of workers.The legal obstacles to the provision of additional benefit in kind shouldbe removed.(iii) Employers should be permitted to make deductions from wages, subjectto provision for appeal to local tribunals,(a) if the worker freely consents;(b) if accepted practice permits, or if the majority of workers agree,for fines and bad work;(c) if the worker or the tribunal agrees that he has been overpaid;(d) if his general terms of service permit, to meet a cash shortagepreviously notified to the worker.July 1962.
