Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 125 Copy No. 6 227th July, 1962CABINETREPORT OF THE ROCHDALE COMMITTEE ON THE MAJOR PORTS INTHE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Minister of TransportMy colleagues will remember that, following consultation with them, Iappointed a committee in March 1961 under Lord Rochdale with the following terms of reference:&quot; To consider to what extent the major docks and harbours of GreatBritain are adequate to meet present and future national needs; whether themethods of working can be improved; and to make recommendations.&quot;2. Lord Rochdale has now presented me with his report. It will take about two months to print. It is, of course, anxiously awaited by the interests concerned,particularly the port authorities and the shipping companies.3. The annex to this paper summarises the main conclusions. (There are,in addition, over 100 detailed recommendations.) These conclusions raise anumber of major issues which will require careful consideration and discussionwith the outside organisations. The present situation in the docks as disclosedby the report is clearly unsatisfactory. I am anxious we should reach somedecisions quickly. In particular, I think that we ought probably to set up some form of National Ports Authority on a non-statutory basis pending legislation to set it up on a statutory basis.4. I propose, therefore, (a) that discussion should proceed between officials of the Departments concerned during August and September, (b) that I should discuss with the outside bodies concerned as soon as the report has been published, and (c) that we should aim at taking at any rate some decisions as tothe action to be taken in late October or early November.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,26th July, 1962.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
AnnexMAIN CONCLUSIONS OF THE ROCHDALE REPORTThe Rochdale report will contain over 100 detailed recommendations. its main conclusions will be that:\I (i) The turn-round of ships at British ports is slow; the costs of handlingcargo are high; and there are not enough berths for large dry cargo ships.(ii) The reasons are inadequacies in:(a) investment in works and equipment;(b) labour arrangements.(iii) The main reason why investment has been inadequate is that port authorities have preferred to keep port dues low. Most ports are not taking enough revenue to cover depreciation, still less to service thecost of new development. A relevant factor is that there are so manyports.(iv) Two main remedies are proposed in the organisational field:(a) A National Ports Authority should be set up, not to operate anyport but to advise, urge and in the last resort compel port authorities towards greater efficiency, particularly through moreinvestment. Among other things, it would seek to carry through&quot; a national plan of port development&quot; by encouraginginvestment at some ports and discouraging it at others.(b) Ports should be reorganised in estuarial groups (as the Port ofLondon Authority replaced three separate undertakings on the thames) so as to allow of rationalisation.(v) The estuarial groups would take over nearly all the major ports owned by the British Transport Commission (Grangemouth, Middlesbrough.Hull, Immingham, Goole, Grimsby, Cardiff, Swansea, Barry,. Newportand Port Talbot). The few remaining British Transport Commissionports (of which Southampton is the only large one) would be handedover to other local bodies.(vi) The higher level of investment would be made possible by higher portdues, by better use of existing resources (e.g., selling inadequately usedland) and by better management. Government subsidies should notbe provided &quot;save in very exceptional circumstances&quot;. Withingroups of ports, unprofitable undertakings should not be supported bythe profitable, but should be overhauled or closed down.(vii) The membership of port boards should be much smaller than at present.(viii) Dock labour should be decasualised to the greatest possible extent.July 1962.
