2dSECRET *this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 106 Copy No. g 24th July, 1962CABINETMALAYSIAMemorandum by the Prime MinisterFollowing meetings in London in November 1961 between British and MalayanMinisters it was announced that the two Governments were convinced that thecreation of a &quot; Federation of Malaysia &quot; (embracing the Federation of Malaya,Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei) was &quot; a desirable aim &quot;; however,it was agreed that, before any final decision was taken, it was necessary to ascertain the views of the peoples of North Borneo and Sarawak.2. A Commission composed of a Chairman (Lord Cobbold) and four members, two nominated by the British Government and two by the MalayanGovernment, was set up to carry out this task with the following terms ofreference:(a) To ascertain the views of the peoples of North Borneo and Sarawak onthis question (i.e., the proposed Federation of Malaysia); and(b) In the light of their assessment of these views to make recommendations.3. The Commission spent rather more than two months in North borneo and Sarawak in the spring and Lord Cobbold submitted its Report to the MalayanPrime Minister and myself on 21st June. We have agreed that it must remainconfidential until we have decided our further course of action in the light of it.4. A memorandum by the Greater Malaysia (Official) Committee, analysingthe Report and the confidential letters from the Chairman which accompanied it,is annexed. Appendices A and B of this memorandum set out the main points of agreement and disagreement between the two sides of the Commission. It willbe seen that the Report is unanimous in supporting the objectives of GreaterMalaysia, although there were unresolved differences between the British andMalayan members of the Commission, which do not appear in the Report itself,over the form of administration in North Borneo and Sarawak during the transitionalstage of the new Federation.5. The Malayan Prime Minister is expected here during the week beginningMonday, 16th July, to discuss the action to be taken in the light of the Report.6. Meanwhile, I invite my colleagues to agree that we should now pursue the negotiations with the Tunku with the aim of realising the objectives of GreaterMalaysia and agreeing acceptable solutions of the transitional problems whichwill protect the interests of the inhabitants of the Borneo Territories.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1962.
annex the COBBOLD COMMISSION REPORTInterim Report by the Committee on Greater MalaysiaIntroductoryThe Greater Malaysia project is of vital concern to British policy, since, ifsuccessfully established, it offers the promise of a new stabilising factor in South-East Asia, of an arrangement for Singapore which would ensure the maintenanceof our defence position there, and of being able to forestall claims on the borneo territories which might be made if they retain colonial status.2. It is therefore very satisfactory that the Cobbold Commission isunanimously in favour of the project and also considers it as being in the interestsof the Borneo Territories.3. Nevertheless, while the Report is unanimous on this main issue and on many other matters, it has left one big and difficult problem to be settled in negotiation between the British and Malayan Governments. This is the problemof what should be the nature of the arrangements for governing and administering the territories during the transitional phase which must precede their full integrationinto the new Federation.Main Points of Agreement within Commission4. These are listed in Appendix A. It is very satisfactory that there is apparently full agreement on the following:(a) Degree of support for Malaysia in territories.(b) Malaysia a workable attractive project which would be in best interestsof territories.(c) Early decision in principle should be taken and announced by Governments.This and Report should be published in territories and debated in territorial legislatures. Subject to results, Malaysia should be set up within 12 months from the date of the decision in principle.(d) On the creation of Malaysia sovereignty over the two territories shouldbe surrendered to the new Federation.(e) Malaysian Constitution to be modelled on existing Malayan federal constitution, i.e., strong Central Government with States enjoying ameasure of autonomy; but in view of special circumstances of borneo territories certain additional speciaL safeguards should apply to themand be unalterable except with positive concurrence of StateGovernment.N.B. No important differences are recorded about the nature ofthese safeguards and in particular there seems to be full agreement on immigration.(/) No right of secession of States.(g) Some form of transitional period during which it is essential to retain theservices of the present British staff and to institute no change in administrative arrangements so far as they affect the &quot; ordinary lives of the people &quot;.(h) Citizenship proposals.   N.B. These raise a difficulty, since they allowFederation citizenship to classes of persons who would not get it underthe proposals already agreed for Singapore. There is however also a recommendation of the Malayan members (paragraph 190 (g)) that persons normally resident in either of the Borneo Territories should notbe allowed to vote or stand for election outside their own territory. Ifthis were applied mutatis mutandis to Singapore it might enable theFederation to agree to the wider citizenship proposals for Singapore.
Main Points of Disagreement5. These are listed in Appendix B. Briefly, the Malayan members think it possible, on Malaysia Day, to anticipate by several years the constitutionalevolution that would be normal in such backward territories by giving immediatelya large measure of local political control to elected Bornean Ministers under a constitutional Head of State. The British members think this quite unrealisticand propose a clearly marked transitional period of three to seven years at thebeginning of which, though sovereignty would have been transferred to Malaysiaat the outset, the administration would be carried on exactly as now, i.e., a BritishGovernor with full executive powers; this system to evolve as speedily as possibletowards a full ministerial set-up during the transitional phase. As shown in the separate letters, the British members would prefer Her Majesty&apos;s Government tocontinue, by delegation from the Federation, to have full authority for all aspectsof administration other than external affairs, defence and anti-subversive measuresduring this phase.The Position of the Malayan Members of the Commission6. (a) The arrangements must be defensible by the Tunku against charges from the Afro-Asians, the Communists and his own public opinion of&quot; neo-colonialism &quot; and &quot; imperialist stooge &quot;.(b) The arrangements must not be such as to exacerbate dissatisfaction in singapore with the terms of the provisional agreement on merger concludedbetween Malaya and Singapore.(c) Integration of the territories in the new Federation as soon as possible isnecessary to prevent racial strife, to forestall Communist mischief-making and toenable an energetic start to be made with essential development plans.(d) As an independent country, the Federation could not accept that itshould share jurisdiction with Britain in a part of its territory.The Position of the British Members of the Commission7. (a) It is essential to retain effective administration during the transitionalphase.  Otherwise there will be a break-down of law and order, and civil strife.(b) It will be some time before the territories can produce a trained personnel to man an effective administration of their own. Meanwhile administration must depend on expatriate officers.(c) It is not fair or reasonable to expect expatriate officers to stay on unlessin some way British control of the Executive is maintained in fact it would amount simply to transferring these officers to the service of a foreign government if British control was not maintained.id) Moreover if there is no British control of the Executive expatriate officers would regard themselves under the normal rules as having a legitimate claim to retire with compensation; and if this had to be granted at least half of them would go.Difficulties for Her Majesty&apos;s Government of Malayan proposals.   Briefly these are:(a) Our belief that they would be contrary&quot; to the wishes and interests of theBornean peoples (they would almost certainly be regarded as a breach of our formal assurances in Sarawak).The Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, is going totake this up with the Tunku.(/) Method of appointing first Head of State in each territory.In brief, there is virtually no disagreement on the ultimate position. Greaterprecision on the division of powers is however necessary before a final decision could be taken on the actual setting up of Malaysia.The only really important points of disagreement, all interrelated, are overthe transitional period.
(b) They might not ensure reasonable and stable Government and might evenlead to a breakdown of administration.(c) They would involve transferring to another Government the services ofofficers of Her Majesty&apos;s Overseas Civil Service, whom all agree shouldstay at their posts and on whose retention most Borneans are insistent.To do this compulsoriiy would cause very great difficulties with thestaff and might not even succeed in retaining them. On the otherhand if the right to retire with compensation is offered, (accordingto precedent elsewhere) it is virtually certain that so many would prefer to go that administration might break-down completely possibly with serious disorders and bloodshed.Negotiations with the Tunku9. The crux of the negotiations with the Tunku will, therefore be to securehis agreement to a form of administration for the transitional period which will ensure stability and enable us to retain willing British administrators in Borneountil effective Bornean replacements can be trained. (N.B. Malays even if theywere available would not be acceptable to the Borneans while Chinese, who format present the great majority of potential local senior civil servants, would not be acceptable to the Malay Government either.)10. Our tactics with the Tunku should no doubt be to start negotiatingfrom the most favourable position from our point of view. But we must recognisethat final success depends on the Tunku accepting and working whateverarrangements can be agreed upon and some concessions to meet him will nodoubt have to be made.11. We are preparing a paper which looks at all the possible alternatives,and we shall be having talks with the Governors and with the British HighCommissioner in the next few days, after which we shall be in a position to makeconcrete proposals for the handling of the negotiations with the Tunku.Summary of Conclusions12. (a) It is very satisfactory that there should be such a wide area ofagreement in the Commission&apos;^ Report. It seems likely that we and the Malayansshould be able to endorse without difficulty most of the agreed recommendations.(b) The main difference of view thrown up by the Report is over the transitional arrangements. This will be the main subject of the forthcoming negotiations withthe Tunku. We may expect the initial Malayan negotiating position to be at least the recommendations made by the Malayan members of the Commission for the transitional period.(c) We must seek a negotiable compromise between these Malayanrecommendations and the recommendations of the British members of theCommission which would protect our own main desiderata while at the sametime avoiding the difficulties the Tunku would foresee in accepting therecommendations of the British members.(d) Urgent and detailed study is being given to what precise shape such a compromise might take and a further report on this will be submitted to ministers as soon as possible.July, 1962.

Appendix BMAIN POINTS OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BRITISH AND MALAYANSIDES OF THE COBBOLD COMMISSIONSubject1. Transitional Period(a) General ...Malayan ViewBritish View*(b) Governor and administration(c) State and FederalPowersid) Expatriate StaffBoth sides envisage a comparatively early transfer of sovereignty theMalayans say &quot; within the next twelve months &quot; (paragraph 188) and both say that there should be a transitional period thereafter,but their respective concepts of this transitional period are basicallydifferent. The Malayans want over-all power to pass at once to theFederation; they say this is essential if they are to produce rapidadvance in economic and social development. The British think thatthe best guarantee of success and avoidance of racial conflict and disorder would be for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to remain in effective control in the territories for a period of three-seven years. Bothsides, much more particularly the British, have watered down theirviews in the Report so as to avoid open contradiction on these matters.The British views are therefore to be obtained from Lord Cobbold&apos;sletter of 21st June to both Prime Ministers and from the Memorandumof the two British members of the Commission of the same date which lord Cobbold submitted to our Prime Minister. This fundamental difference of approach comes out, but only in a suppressed form, in chapter VI of the Report. It comes out much more clearly in theaccompanying letters.The Governor should be a constitu-tional ruler and there is no needfor him to be British. He wouldappoint a Chief Minister who hadthe confidence of the Legislatureand act on his advice, i.e., a fullMinisterial system could be set upstraight away in each State.Essential that not Only defence and external affairs but all aspects ofinternal security (not just anti-subversion) be Federal subjects from the start. All subjects thatare eventually to be Federal shouldalso be handed over to the newFederation at once although theFederation would delegate to theChief Ministers of the respectiveStates the exercise of as manyfunctions as may be necessary forthe maintenance of good admini-stration. Malayans do not want to delegate back Finance but seemto regard this point as negotiable.Malayans agree that British staff should be retained but offer no solution to problem of avoidingan offer of early retirement withcompensation.The Governor should be Britishand be an executive Head withthe same powers as now. Afull Ministerial system should develop but would take someyears.The real British view is that, afterthe transfer of sovereignty therewould be an agreement betweenthe new Federation and her majesty&apos;s Government that powers other than those overExternal Affairs, Defence andthe anti-subversive aspects ofInternal Security would forsome years continue to beexercised in the territories bythe British Government (LordCobbold&apos;s letter of 21st Juneon behalf of Commission to both Prime Ministers). This iswatered down in the Report.Since the Report leaves out theidea that these powers shouldbe exercised by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, it appears that theproposal would be for them tobe exercised by the Governor asthe Head of State Government.The State Government wouldhave policy control and legisla-tive powers, not merely &quot; execu-tive functions &quot; (paragraph 153).Governor to be as at (b) above,with Secretary of State for colonies still exercising ultimatecontrol over staff; basis of their employment would be un-changed and thus no questionof immediate retirement would arise.* Except where otherwise specified &quot; British View &quot; includes Lord Cobbold&apos;s own view.
SubjectUltimate Position(a) Religion......(paragraph 148 (e))(b) Language......(paragraph 148 (/))Malayan ViewIslam should be the National Religionof Malaysia as in the presentFederation. (Article 3 (1) of theFederal Constitution says &quot; Islamis the religion of the Federation:but other religions may bepractised in peace and harmonyin any part of the Federation.&quot;)They note that under presentFederal Constitution certain public expenditure may be incurred forIslamic purposes and that this maybe considered objectionable inBorneo, but they make no recom-mendation about this.Lord Cobbold and Malayan membersof the Commission think Malayshould be the national language.(Note. Presumably as in presentFederal Constitution.) Malaymembers think English should remain official language for tenyears or until Central Governmentdecides otherwise &quot; in consultationwith &quot; State Government.British ViewSpecific provisions about freedomof religion should be writteninto &quot; State Constitution&quot;.Present provision in the malayan Constitution aboutIslam should not apply to north borneo and Sarawak. (Note. -These make the Ruler of aState, other than Malacca andPenang, the Head of the Muslimreligion in his State. In Malaccaand Penang the State Constitu-tions are required to provide that the Agong is Head of the muslim religion in those States.)British members of Commissionthink that question whetherMalay should be the nationallanguage should be decided byBorneo peoples themselves whenfully elected representative bodies have been constituted.Lord Cobbold and they considerMalay and English should beofficial languages without time limit, until and unless StateGovernment decides otherwise.Possible differences that might be inferred from correspondence aboutcompleting the Cobbold Commission&apos;s Report(a) Ultimate Constitu-tional Position(b) Length of Transi-tional period the Malayans want the ultimateposition of North Borneo andSarawak in Malaysia to be made clear from the start.Malayans have not specifically dis-agreed with this but may in theevent differ with us over the lengthof the period (they have apparentlynot agreed to any length but preferthis should be left to joint working parties of Central and StateGovernments).There is nothing to show that theBritish members or LordCobbold disagree with this butthey have not specifically agreed.British members and LordCobbold have proposed theperiod should be three, five orseven years.
