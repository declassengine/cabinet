Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1962C. (62) 141 Copy No.   g \18th September, 1962CABINETFARM IMPROVEMENT scheme memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food andthe Secretary of State for ScotlandSince the war and its immediate aftermath, the Farm Improvement Scheme(Agriculture Act, 1957, Part II) has been the most important single step forward in Government agricultural policy. Following a meeting of Ministers in Aprilunder the Chairmanship of the First Secretary of State, it was decided that theScheme should go on, but with the rate of grant reduced from 33-J per cent, to25 per cent. The question now is whether the decision to reduce the rate of grant is right in the light of all that has happened in the meantime on the common market front.2. In April we fell in with the general view that the rate should be reduced,and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, with whom we have discussed the matter,considers that this decision should be upheld. For the reasons given in this paper,we feel strongly that the rate of grant ought at the least to be maintained andfor this reason we ask our colleagues to reconsider the decision.3. Our reason is simply this. In April we were hopeful that most of the direct grants and subsidies, at present amounting to a quarter of farmers&apos; income,could be retained if we went into the Common Market. Further information fromBrussels leads us to fear that the majority of these grants will probably be unacceptable, but we are fairly confident that the Farm Improvement scheme could continue. Meanwhile, it is now extremely doubtful whether we shall beable to convince farming opinion that the Government have fulfilled their pledgeabout &quot; the vital interests of British agriculture &quot;. At the very least, it would create the worst possible atmosphere in which we should be asked to explain the vulnerability of the direct grants which mean so much to our farmers, if we hadto say that in the case of the one grant which seems invulnerable we were gratuitouslyreducing the rate of grant.4. We realise from the Treasury&apos;s point of view that the reduction in the rateof grant to 25 per cent, would mean a saving of about  3 million a year (i.e.,expenditure of  7 million a year as opposed to  10 million). But in view of thedifficulties we are having in the Brussels negotiations, and the serious inroads which,in the Common Market, we are likely to have to make into our system of directgrants which total some  100 million a year, we think it would be most inadvisable to reduce at this point of time the rate of this particular grant. The increase inefficiency and lower working costs produced by these structural improvements willbe vital to our farmers, especially if income supports are to be reduced. France,Germany and Italy are spending three to six times as much as we are on grants forstructural improvement.5. In these fresh circumstances, a case could easily be made out for increasingthe rate of grant and accelerating the modernisation of our farms. We are not asking for this: but we do urge our colleagues to agree that the present rate of grant should not be reduced.
6. The matter is urgent. As at present drafted, the Agriculture (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, to be published immediately after The Queen&apos;s speech, allows the farm Improvement Scheme to continue but at the reduced rate of grant and provides a further  35 million for the next five years. We ask our colleagues to agree thatthe Bill should leave the rate of grant unchanged at 33^ per cent, which will requirethe provision of  50 million instead of  35 million.C. S.M. N.17th September, 1962.
