(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJKSTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)2nd October, 1962CABINET,MJMAYMEN&apos;S wages memorandum by the Minister of labour I present this memorandum as Deputy Chairman of the wages committee.The claims2.        The National Union of Railwaymen have claimed increasesvariously calculated at 11, 5 per cent and 12. 9 per cent in the pay of the lowest paid railwaymen, and 5. 65 per cent in the pay of the salaried staffwhom they represent.    The Transport Salaried Staffs&apos; Association andthe Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen have .1claimed 7 per cent.    All these claims are presented as continuationsof the earlier claims which were settled this spring with what theunions regarded as an &quot;interim&quot; increase of 3 per cent.Time-table3.        The British Transport Commission are studying the claims andare reporting to their Chairman, Dr. Beeching, on his return fromleave.    Pie will then reach his own conclusions and inform theGovernment of them.     We shall then have to decide on our attitudequickly, since Dr, Beeching feels that it will be necessary to answer the claims in a meeting of the Railway Staff National Council probably in the week beginning 15th October,Dr. Beeching&apos;s present views4.        Preliminary discussion between the Minister of Transport and dr. Beeching has shown that he is not prepared to accept in toto theapplication of the principles of the Guillebaud Report on which theunions&apos; figures are based:  (in any case their method of calculationis suspect).    He did, however, express the view before he went on leave that it would be necessary to go to 6 per cent in order toreach a settlement;  tactically he would prefer to make an initialoffer of the figure he thought right and then stick to it.    He was anxious that the settlement of the wages claim should result in theright atmosphere for negotiations with the unions on the streamliningof the railway system, which might involve total redundancies of upto 150, 000 men.    A sensible settlement would conduce to a periodCOPY NO. jb ?
of co-operation and stability.     If, when he has decided what the rightfigure should be, the Government do not agree with it, he will have tobe told to do something different.     The disagreement would inevitably become public at that stage.The views of Wages Committee5.        The Minister of Transport thinks that the Government shouldback Dr. Beeching&apos;s judgment even if he wishes to concede as muchas a 6 per cent increase.    He and his fellow members of theCommission have been appointed expressly to carry through the re-organisation of the railways, which promises immense relief to theExchequer.    A head-on clash with Dr. Beeching might mean that hewould no longer be available to carry through this huge task;  andthere is no one else in sight who would be likely to fill his place.The Minister thinks that Dr, Beeching could be persuaded to adoptsomewhat different negotiating tactics provided that the ultimate figure was in line with his own ideas.6.        Other members of the Wages Committee think that 6 per centis too much;  that in view of the present disagreement between theCommission and the unions it was not clear that even a 6 per centoffer would restore good relations;  and that we should declare ourview in terms of the money which Parliament and the Exchequer, asthe railways&apos;bankers, should be asked to find for increases inrailwaymen&apos;s pay, and not in terms of &apos;X&apos; per cent on railwaymen&apos;rates of pay.    They also disagree with Dr. Beeching&apos;s proposednegotiating tactics.7.        A refinement of the majority view in the Committee is thata sum granted in this financial year for pay increases might be keptconstant in future years and thus enable further increases to be paid as redundancy reduces the size of the labour force.    This, it issuggested, would accord with one of the objectives of re-organising the railways - that they could pay better wages.    There might,however, be practical difficulties.     The sum which might have to befound for the increases by way of supplementary estimate this year would be part only of the cost of a wage increase in a full year.    Andeven if in each subsequent year the sum calculated to be required fora full year were held to be notionally available, this would not enablesubstantial improvements to be made in wage rates;  for instance, ifthe sum were sufficient to provide a 4 per cent increase for thepresent labour force, there would have to be a reduction of 125, 000 mena quarter of the labour force - to give the remainder a further per cent increase.     Dr. Beeching is also understood to regard this idea as impracticable.Oil--..&quot;-:&quot;;   -;. &apos;.&apos;&quot;&apos;;&apos;.-..&apos;.-:&apos;-&quot;- - .&quot;--&quot;..-       .:;&apos; : ....... . . . .      ... . . ....     - :        ;8,        The main points which persuaded the majority of theCommittee are:-On the amount of the increase: -(a)   The unions accepted an increase of 3 per cent as from 1st April, 1962, after they had seen the PrimeMinister, who told them that -secret
&quot;It would be open to them to start discussions with Dr. Beeching again later in the year, by which time it would be possible to see how the railwayshad fared and what improvement had taken placein the general economic situation. 11The railwuyo.&apos;&apos; financial results are certainly no better,though there is a real promise of improvement in thefuture;  and although the general economic situation has in some respects improved nothing has happened to lessen the need for restraint in the growth of personal incomes.(b) 6 per cent would cost the nationalised transport under-takings some  24 million in the first year; all ofthis would fall on the taxpayer, but in due coursesome of the increases would be absorbed by manage-ment action and by the run-down of the labour force.The Government would be criticised for putting such a burden on public funds in order to give a particulargroup of employees an aggregate increase of9 per cent;  though this would be their total increase over a period of nearly three years.(c) The first repercussions of such an increase would be felt in the railway workshops and thence in theengineering industry.    The engineers recently received a 3 per cent increase after long negotiations.-The charge might be heard that an irresponsible leadwas being given to the private sector, though the fact is that the railways are only catching up.(d) The railways have no general recruiting problem tojustify a large wage increase.    Their manpower willin fact have to be reduced, though they have severeshortages of key grades in certain areas.(e) A figure of 6 per cent would look very large in comparison with the 3 per cent of last April&apos;ssettlement, although it was of course recognisedat the time that the matter would be re-opened.(f) Too big an increase granted in an employment whichis regarded as within the Governments direct control might at this stage prejudice the launching of the National Incomes Commission.On the negotiating tactics:-(g) An offer, take it or leave it, is contrary to thehistory of railway pay, for settling whichnegotiating machinery exists, in which bargainingtakes place, for which the unions exist,
(h) Dr. Beeching has already tried &apos;take it or leave it&apos;tactics on redundancy payments.    The unions areusing this as one of the arguments to sustain theircharge of lack of consultation in the present dispute with the Transport Commission.(i) If &quot;take it or leave it&apos; tactics are tried and fail, asettlement, whether by negotiation or by anarbitrator&apos;s award, is likely to be at a figure higherthan the management thinks sufficient.Our sticking point9.        What should be our sticking point ?    The Committee are agreedthat 3 per cent would be tolerable.    This would cost about  12 million.Some of us think that there should be negotiating latitude up to4 per cent ( 16 million) or even a little higher.    Most of us would seeadvantage in expressing the limit in cash rather than percentage, if thisproves practicable.    It is most unlikely that Dr. Beeching would accept these limitations.    Further discussions will be needed withhim.     If agreement cannot be reached, it will be necessary for theGovernment^ view to be made clear, presumably by a letter addressedto him which would be for publication.10.       In deciding what view to take, how this should be conveyed,and by whom, we must take into account the possible consequences.These might include Dr. Beeching&apos;s resignation, an appeal by theunions to the prime Minister, recourse to arbitration, or a strike.J.K.Ministry of Labour, S.
