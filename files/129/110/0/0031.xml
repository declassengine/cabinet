Dr. ROBERT SOBLENMemorandum by the Secretary ol State for the Hom^DgpartmentI am afraid that I must trouble my colleagues with a difficult case which could raise important diplomatic considerations and is almost certain to produce Parliamentary trouble whatever course is taken.The case is that of Dr. Robert Soblen.2.      Dr. Soblen is an American citizen (by naturalisation in 1947) ofLithuanian origin.     He was convicted in the United States in July, 1961,of espionage on behalf of Russia, and sentenced to life imprisonment.Pending disposal of his appeal (which was eventually dismissed) he wasreleased on bail.    He jumped his bail, went to Israel, and was expelledfrom Israel as an illegal immigrant.    He was put on an Israeli planefrom which at Athens he was transferred to another Israeli plane on acommercial flight to the United States via London Airport, where it hadto stop for refuelling.    (On this journey he was accompanied by a united States marshal, knowledge of whose presence on the plane has since been disclaimed by Israeli Ministers. )    Information was received at London Airport that He would be on this flight, and arrangements weremade to refuse him leave to land as an undesirable alien.    shortly before the aircraft was due to arrive on 1st July, he cut his wrists andabdomen with a knife, and owing to the severity of his injuries it wasnecessary, with the acquiescence of the Immigration Officer, to removehim to hospital.     It appeared to the Immigration Officer to beimpossible, owing to Dr. Soblen&apos;s condition, to serve a refusal notice on him;  but the notice was handed to the American marshal, v/ho was holding Dr. Soblen&apos;s Israeli temporary travel document, and a copy ofit was served on the carrying company.    On 3rd July, as soon asDr. Soblen was fit to be interviewed, an Immigration Officer served a refusal notice on him.3.      On 7th July, Dr. Soblen was pronounced by the hospital to be fitto be moved as a stretcher case.    On that day his legal advisersobtained leave to serve a writ of habeas corpus against the HomeSecretary.    On the following day he was moved to Brixton prison, where he still is.     The application for habeas corpus was rejected by the divisional Court on 17th July.    He appealed to the Court of Appeal,which on 26th July dismissed the appeal and refused leave to appeal tothe House of Lords.     It is still open to him to go to the AppealCommittee of the House of Lords for leave, but his advisers may welldecide not to appear further but rather to rely on a petition which theysent to me on 25th July.     Even if he applied to the Appeal Committee,the issues raised in this memorandum would still arise when his case hadfinally been disposed of.C.(62) 131 COPY NO.    ^Cj27th July, 1962CABINET
4.      The petition is for political asylum here, or, failing that, for permission for him to go to some country other than the United States.5.      His advisers have obtained him a visa for Czechoslovakia.They are also trying to get him an immigrant&apos;3 visa for Israel, but the israeli Government have rejected this application:   and although they propose to appeal to a court, the only country, other than the UnitedStates, known to be open to Dr. Soblen at present is Czechoslovakia,6,      The plea for political asylum presents little difficulty.    the criteria forlhis are well established.     The applicant must convinceus that by reason of his political opinions, race, colour or creed, hewill be subjected, if obliged to return to his own country, to danger of life or liberty, or of persecution of such a kind and extent as to renderlife insupportable.     These criteria have no application to the case ofsomeone whoj having been convicted of criminal acts (whether or not done for a political object) by the courts of a country possessingdemocratic institutions and full constitutional guarantees, is a fugitivefrom his country&apos;s justice.     The application for political as3dum must clearly be rejected.7.      The question whether he should be allowed to go to some countryother than the United States - in practice, to Czechoslovakia - is muchmore difficult.8.      Public opinion here is probably expecting that Dr. Soblen willbbe put in an aircraft bound for the United States.    If he is not, theAmerican reactions are likely to be very adverse.     That we should allow a Russian spy, who is a fugitive from the justice of our principalally, to return behind the Iron Curtain, might well produce a difficultdiplomatic situation, and it could be argued that, by directing his returnto the United States, we should really be doing no more than restore theposition to what it was when Dr. Soblen&apos;s journey was interrupted byhis own act.9.      On the other hand,  there are powerful considerations pointingthe other way.    First, espionage is not an extraditable offence, and itis established practice that the powers of the Aliens Order are not used as a substitute for extradition.     It  may be argued that if we now sendDr. Soblen on to the United States we are doing precisely that.Secondly, there would be strong Parliamentary criticism^bf the enforcement of the return to a country from which a foreigner has fledfor allegedly political reasons, without opportunity being given to himto make his way to another country willing to receive him.    Thisbecame apparent in the Commons debate on the Perez Selles case on 6th March, 1958 (Hansard: Fifth Series, Volume 5 83, Columns 1409-1468);  and my predecessor then accepted the position that, so far asthe Aliens Order was concerned, the Home Office interest is limitedto securing that an alien who has been refused leave to land should not remain in this country, and that it does not extend to securing his return to a country to which he himself does not want to go,-2-

10.    The Security Service are of opinion that, so far as our own security is concerned, the prospect of Dr. Soblen&apos;s going behind theIron Curtain (though on professional grounds they would prefer that itshould be avoided) is not a decisive fa.ctor.    He has leukaemia, whichwill eventually have a fatal termination;   and although he may haveinformation of some, value to impart, the risks are not to be put very high.    From the wider point of view, the Security Service would naturally fear some adverse effect on their own relations with theUnited States security services if Dr. Soblen were allowed to gobehind the Iron Curtain.11.    The short point is whether the wider considerations in this case should prevail,    Kad the country to which Dr. Soblen proposes to gonot been a Soviet satellite, I should ha.ve found it hard to stand in theway of his doing so, on the ground that so long as effect is given to our decision not to let him into the United Kingdom it is really.not ourconcern where he goes.     But the effect on public opinion, both here andin the United States, of allowing a man convicted of spying by an american court, and a fugitive from its sentence, to go behind the iron curtain cannot be disregarded.     I think that we can defend a decisionto send him back to the United States on the ground that we shouldundoubtedly have done so had he been unwounded at the time of his arrival here;   and that we are therefore doing no more than restore the situation in which in normal circumstances he would have beenplaced. -   I so recommend.H. B.Home Office, S. W, 1.27th July, 1962-3-SECRET
