(62) 40th Conclusions, Minute 6) the Committee on Broadcasting and television have considered the draft of a White Paper dealing with certain technical matters arising from the Pilkington Report. The Committee thoughtthat subject to Cabinet approval a White Paper should be presented early in July;that its scope should not be limited to technical matters; that it should include a statement that the Government would wait to see how public opinion reactedbefore giving their own views on the structural changes in independent televisionrecommended by the Pilkington Committee; and that there would be no need fora separate statement of the Governments position at this stage.2. In preparing the annexed draft White Paper the Postmaster-General hastaken into account points which were raised in the Committee&apos;s discussion.Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1962C.

TELEVISION AND BROADCASTINGPART I1. The B.B.C. Royal Charter and Licence, and the Television Act, expirein July 1964. This has presented both the need and the opportunity for a fundamental examination of television and broadcasting.2. Although in the final analysis it is the duty of the Government and ofParliament to reach conclusions on the important and far-reaching questions involved, the Government felt that as on previous occasions it should first seek the views of an independent Committee. The Government, therefore, set up in1960 a Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington.3. The Committee have now reported to the Postmaster-General(Cmnd. 1753). [The Government is indeed grateful to Sir Harry Pilkington andto the members of the Committee for the thorough examination they have carried out.]4. The importance of the issues, and the far-reaching nature of certain ofthe Committee&apos;s recommendations, make it wise to avoid precipitate decisions.At the same time it is most desirable to reach early conclusions on some questionsincluding the vital technical ones in order to lessen or remove the present uncertainty and doubt which is having a depressive effect on the broadcastingmedium and the industries which serve it.5. Part II of this White Paper therefore sets out the Governments first seriesof proposals. On certain issues, however, the Government has not yet reachedconclusions, but intends to give them further consideration in the light of the views expressed in Parliament and in the country. The more important of these issues are referred to in Part III. The Government hopes to put forward proposals inthe autumn.PART IIThe Governments ProposalsConstitutional Issues6. No change is proposed by the Committee, or by the Government, in themain constitutional position. The B.B.C. will continue to be constituted by RoyalCharter and the I.T.A. by Act of Parliament. The Government accepts theCommittee&apos;s view that no independent Scottish or Welsh Corporation should beset up. It is, however, proposed that the B.B.C. National Broadcasting councils should play a more important part (paragraph 13 below).7. The Government accepts the Committees view that the Charter and the television Act should be renewed for 12 years from 30th July, 1964. It will bringproposals before Parliament in due course for extending the life of the I.T.A. forthis period.8. The Committee recommend that where it is possible for only one camerateam to be present at Royal and State occasions of national interest, the B.B.C.should undertake the broadcast, the television picture being made available, as of right, to the I.T.A. The Government accepts this conclusion for those occasionswhich it has been agreed should be televised. As at present, both B.B.C. andI.T.A. should provide their own commentators where this is practicable.9. In general, the Government accepts the Committee&apos;s proposals on theChairman and Governors of the B.B.C. and the Chairman and Members of theI.T.A. While it does not propose to make the ability to speak Welsh an absoluterequirement for B.B.C. National Governor for Wales, it does propose to include,in the provision in the Charter which requires the National Broadcasting councils to exercise control &quot; with full regard to the distinctive culture, interests and tastesof Our People in that country &quot;, a specific reference to language.SECRET60988 A 2
10. The Postmaster-General will continue to be the Minister responsible for broadcasting, under the general direction of the Prime Minister. There will beno separate Minister for Broadcasting.&apos; r 11. No major change is proposed in the powers of the Government, whichwill remain largely as at present. These powers are largely reserve powers, andthe traditional independence of the broadcasting authorities in the matter of programme content, and of day-to-day management of their aifairs, will continue.This is not to say that changes will not be proposed in the new Charter and Act.It would be surprising if with the passage of time changes in machinery andcontrol had not shown themselves to be desirable. Some changes the Governmenthas already in view, and the desirability of others may emerge in the course ofParliamentary debates.12. The Postmaster-General&apos;s powers to control the hours of broadcastingwill continue.13. The Committee recommends an important constitutional innovation inrelation to television; namely that the B.B.C. National Broadcasting Councils forScotland and Wales (and for Northern Ireland if one is set up) should exercise the same powers in relation to the content of television services as they already dofor sound. This, the Government accepts, and it proposes to recommend this change in the new Charter. It will, if need be, recommend transferring this additional function even earlier by means of a supplemental Charter.14. The Government accepts the following recommendations with regard toAdvisory Committees.(1) The appointment of the B.B.C.&apos;s General Advisory Council, but not its size, to continue to be prescribed by the Charter. The Council to contain men and women of standing and independence representativeof the people and active in the life of Scotland and Wales, particularly as the Council has specific duties in regard to selection of membersof the National Broadcasting Councils: The same general considerations apply in regard to Northern Ireland, particularly if aNational Broadcasting Council were set up there.(2) The size of the B.B.C. National Broadcasting Councils to be variablebetween 8 and 12 members, and the requirement that certain membersbe selected &quot; as being representative of local authorities in the country concerned &quot; to be deleted. The Councils should be representative ofthe interests of the public in general, and local authorities may well be consulted by the General Advisory Council in the process of selection.15. The Government commends to the attention of the B.B.C. theCommittee^ comments about an advisory committee on Scientific Programmes.16.&apos; The Committee recommend that the B.B.C.&apos;s Central Religious AdvisoryCommittee, which advises the I.T.A. as well as the B.B.C. on religious broadcasting,should include a larger number of lay members chosen for their personal qualities.They also recommend that the I.T.A. should set up a religious advisory committeeof its own, separate from the B.B.C. Committee. It will be for the B.B.C. andI.T.A. to discuss these proposals with religious bodies and leaders.17. The Committee recommend that it should no longer be a statutoryrequirement, as under the present Television Act, for the I.T.A. to set up the threeadvisory, committees which advise them on religious broadcasting, children&apos;s and young persons&apos; programmes, and advertising standards, and that the advice ofthese committees should no longer be mandatory. The Committee also recommendthat the Authority should as a statutory requirement set up a General AdvisoryCouncil, its size to be determined by the Authority, and a separate Committeeto advise on schools broadcasting. These matters are bound up closely with thegeneral question of the future structure of independent television, which is dealtwith in Part III. The Government therefore reserves its position here for the timebeing. It agrees, however, with the Committee&apos;s view that representation on the advertising advisory committee should be strengthened with general consumerrepresentation, such as a representative of housewives and mothers.18: The Committee also recommend that the Authority should set up aCommittee for Wales to advise it on the general conduct of independent television
iti: Wales, as it has done in Scotland and Northern Ireland, The Governmentthinks this is right, but agrees with the Committee that these arrangements dp not require statutory force.19. Certain detailed recommendations with regard to, the Charter andLicence of the B.B.C. and the Television Act and I.T.A. Licence (paragraphs487-491 of the Report) will be dealt with when these documents:are redrafted.,Sound Broadcasting ^ &apos;20.   The Committee take the view that no additional national sound broadcasting services are needed and here the Government is in agreement. Localbroadcasting is dealt with in Part III.21. The B.B.C. wishes to extend progressively the hours of its ThirdProgramme/Network Three throughout the day, and to run the Light Programmefrom 5.30 a.m. until 2 a.m. The B.B.C.&apos;s intention is to provide more serious musicin Network Three and more light music in the Light Programme. Bearing in mind the claims of shift-workers and others, and the relative cheapness of extending the hours of sound broadcasting as compared with television, the Postmaster-General will now authorise extensions in sound hours up to the times indicated;,Television22. The scope of television in this country, during the next 10 or even 20years, will be determined by decisions to be taken now. These are conditioned by what is technically possible.The Technical Possibilities23. The number of television programmes technically possible depends onthe total frequency space available and the bandwidth required, i.e., the amount ofthis space each transmission needs.24. The bandwidth in turn depends principally on the number of lines which makes up the picture. Our present picture is on 405 lines, and this needs abandwidth of 5 megacycles per second. The higher continental standard-625 lines needs a wider bandwidth of 8 megacycles per second to do it full justice. -, y25. The space available for television in the frequency spectrum is limited,and so fewer programmes are possible using 625 lines than on 405 lines. However,for international planning reasons the same bandwidth (8 megacycles) will be usedin the Ultra High Frequency bands as on the Continent and the number of programmes will therefore be the same, whether we retain 405 lines or change to625 lines.26. Television must use frequencies in either the Very High Frequency(V.H.F.), or the Ultra High Frequency (U.H.F.) range. The V.H.F. frequenciesavailable for television by international agreement are Bands I and III, and theU.H.F. frequencies are Bands IV and V. So far, we have not used UH.F. for television.Band I (41-68 Mc/s). &apos;27. This Band provides five 405-line channels. It is used for B.B.C. television,and is virtually fully employed. The B.B.C. continue to improve and extend theircoverage in this Band by means of low-power satellite stations. Stages I, II and of their scheme have already been approved and when completed 99-5 percent, of the population will be covered. Further low-power stations will be possible but 100 per cent, coverage is not possible.Band III (174-216 Mc/s) ..v&apos;28. This Band provides eight 405-line channels. It is partly used for IT.A.television which serves some 94 per cent, of the population and will also be furtherextended by means of low-power stations. But this does not. exhaust Band til.It could be used to provide an additional 405-line programme serving some 95per cent, of the population. . &apos;:
29, Alternatively, it could be used, on 405 lines, to provide a self-containedtelevision service in Wales at present South Wales has to share its programme with the West of England and to extend and improve coverage elsewhere inthe United Kingdom of the existing B.B.C. and IT.A. programmes.30. Thus, even if we were to stay on 405 lines, we should have to bringU.H.F. into service for television unless we remained content indefinitely with one more programme, itself not of fully national coverage.Bands IV and V (470-582 Mc/s and 606-960 Mc/s)31. The upper part of Band V is already being used for other types ofcommunication. Nevertheless four television services with near-national coverageon 625 lines can be accommodated in Bands IV and V by using frequencies up to822 Mc/s. For full national coverage for these programmes frequencies up to854 Mc/s would be needed, and the Government is examining the possibilities ofmaking this additional frequency space ultimately available.32. Bands I and III can together in the long term accommodate two 625-lineprogrammes with near-national coverage so that the four television bands cantogether provide six national programmes even on 625 lines.The Long-term Plan33r The Committee take the view that it is right to plan on the assumptionthat the maximum use should be made of frequencies available. They foreseea need, in 15 years&apos; time, for all six programmes. They recommend that one additional programme (B.B.C.) should be authorised immediately and a second(I.T.A.) within five years of the Authority being reconstituted as they propose.34. The Government subscribes to the view that an ultimate pattern of six programmes should be kept in sight, with two additional programmes being provided in the next few years. The Government feels that in this pervasive andpersuasive medium it is essential to make possible more selective and rewardingviewing.35. For this two things are necessary. First, a greater choice of programmes.And second a greater proportion of the more thoughtful and challenging types of programme.The Question of Education36. Some people take the view that the first need is to offer more programmes of a strictly educational nature and that a separate channel should be given entirely to education and run by an educational authority.37. While the Government fully agrees that television can do a great deal more for education it considers, as do the Committee, that such programmes willbe best provided as part of the general service programmes and that it would bea mistake to hive them off, at this stage at least, into an entirely separateprogramme insulated from the attractions of television in general.38. The Government is anxious that an early start should be made in providing more educational programmes for adults. This is a comparatively newfield, and the potential value to viewers is great. The Government is therefore prepared to authorise at once additional hours for the B.B.C. and I.T.A. televisionservices, provided these are used for programmes for the education of adults, these programmes to be defined by reference to an agreed formula. It proposes to ask the B.B.C. and I.T.A. to produce such a formula for its consideration, inconsultation with the educational authorities.39. So long as the B.B.C. and I.T.A. have each a single service, it is inevitable that most of these adult educational programmes are likely to fall outside the peak evening viewing hours. The long-term answer is to provideextra services.Additional Programmes40. One directly effective way of giving the viewer a choice of different types of programme, including more programmes of an educational andinformative nature, or drawn from regional sources, is to authorise the B.B.C. to
put out a second one. This the Committee recommend and the government proposes to authorise. The new programme will be on 625 lines in U.H.F. (seeparagraph 44 below). The timetable is discussed in paragraph 50. The quest^nof allocating an additional programme to the I.T.A. is dealt with in Part III.   &quot;Standards in Television Programmes ...... i41. The Government wishes to make clear that it is impressed with-the criticisms made against violence and triviality in television generally. TheGovernments aim is to encourage higher standards all round, on all television programmes, both B.B.C. and I.T.A., and it proposes to discuss the question with both these bodies.New Receiving Sets42. To provide the additional programmes for which a need is foreseen will mean bringing into use the Ultra High Frequency (U.H.F.) Bands, and new setsand aerials will be needed to receive them.43. Most viewers will probably feel that a better picture, additionalprogrammes and a wider choice will be well worth the cost of new sets and aerials.In any case existing programmes will continue to be receivable on existing setsfor a number of years.Line Definition ;44. The Government has decided that new programmes in U.H.F. shouldbe on 625 lines from the start. The Television Advisory Committee Report 1960pointed out that the introduction Of television in Bands IV and V would providethe last opportunity of improving the technical standards of our television picture;and that at such a stage it would be in the country&apos;s long-term interest to changeour standards. The Committee have endorsed this view. It is also theGovernments view, particularly having regard to the increasing importance ofthe international exchange of programmes, recorded or live, including those overthe Eurovision network, which will be facilitated by the change in standards.45. The present services will continue on 405 lines for some considerable time to come. It would be wrong, however, to continue these programmesindefinitely on technically inferior standards and sooner or later, therefore, thesetoo should be changed over to 625 lines. This raises a complicated technical issue as to the best method of changeover from 405 to 625 lines. Expert opinion isthat this question cannot be decided until experience of U.H.F. television in thiscountry has been obtained. Test transmissions in the U.H.F. Bands will start this year and these will help to solve the problem. It may well be that this will involve duplicating the existing 405 line programmes on 625 lines in U.H.F. Inthis event the frequency space available in Bands IV and V (paragraph 31 above)would all be needed from an early date.46. As has already been said, viewers will need new receivers and aerialsif they wish to receive the new programmes in U.H.F. The Radio Industry will therefore need to produce sets capable of receiving the existing programmes on405 lines in V.H.F. and new programmes on 625 lines in U.H.F. TheGovernment has noted with appreciation that the industry has already applieditself to this problem and has succeeded in producing sets which will do this at prices not greatly in excess of the present cost.The Timetable47. The creation of a national network of U.H.F. stations will be a majorundertaking, since more U.H.F. stations than V.H.F. stations are needed toprovide the same coverage, because the service area of U.H.F. stations is more restricted than that of V.H.F. stations. ^yml^t48. This is inherent in U.H.F. television and it must be overcome by building a larger number of carefully planned stations, and using highertransmission power. (U.H.F. television has a compensating advantage in thatit. is comparatively free from man-made interference, e.g., from car ignitionsystems.). &apos;        .1      -       .....     - ......:. &apos; : : * \. .......  &apos;
49. Existing V.H.F. sites and masts will be used to the fullest possible extent,but many new U.H.F. stations will need to be built. All U.H.F. programmes forthe same area will be transmitted from the same sites and masts, as indeed theCommittee recommend.50. The proposed timetable is the start of a public service by the B.B.C inU.H.F. by mid-1964 in London; and its extension to the rest of the country as rapidly as possible after that. But a timetable of some years is inevitable, as itwas for the B.B.C. and IT.A. present networks, and the planning of the newnetwork will need urgent and thorough study.Television for Scotland and Wales51. Wales has not hitherto enjoyed a self-contained television service.Important parts of the principality are served by stations which also serve Englishviewers. In particular, South Wales and the West of England are served by thesame stations, with the result that the programmes are unable to meet fully the differing needs of either area. This can only be remedied by bringing into useadditional transmitters. Frequencies which can be used for this purpose areavailable in Band III (paragraphs 28 and 29).52. A similar problem exists to some extent in Scotland, where areas in theSouth-West receive their television from stations outside Scotland.53.   This problem does not arise in Northern Ireland.54. The Committee recommend that the first call on the unallottedfrequencies in Band III should be to enable the B.B.C. to separate its service to wales from that to the English Regions. The Government accepts this, andproposes to authorise the B.B.C. to go ahead as early as possible with theprovision of a new transmitter to enable a distinctively Welsh service to be givento South Wales. Stations to serve North-East Wales and South-West scotland will probably also be necessary to implement the conception of self-containednational television services.55. It will still be possible, after meeting the needs of Wales and Scotland,to make some further use of the unallotted Band III frequencies. The committee recommend using them to improve the reception of the existing B.B.C. and IT.A.programmes and to complete their coverage. The Government will discuss withthe B.B.C. and the I.T.A. the use of frequencies available for this purpose.56. The needs of Wales and Scotland have been kept fully in mind in thepreliminary planning of U.H.F. television and ultimately a fully self-containedservice for both countries, and in Northern Ireland, will be possible in Bands IVand V. At that stage it will be possible to close down the special V.H.F. servicesnow to be provided as a short-term measure.Colour Television57. The Committee recommend that colour television should start on a modest scale on 625 lines in U.H.F., and that meanwhile no public colour service on 405 lines should be authorised.58. This is in line with Government thinking and it is proposed to authorisethe B.B.C. to start transmitting some programmes in colour as part of their secondprogramme (paragraphs 40 and 50), and similarly for any future I.T.A. secondprogramme.  The system of transmission is, however, not yet finally decided.59. Television programmes are expensive to produce in colour, and thespecial receiving sets necessary would also cost much more than monochrome sets,at least to start with. But the Government feels that colour must have a placein the future pattern of television, and that its introduction should not be postponed indefinitely on the score of cost.Finance60. The proposals for more hours for sound broadcasting, a second television programme, a start to colour, Welsh and Scottish television, and more educationalprogrammes for adults on the present television service will mean increased B.B.C.expenditure. The B:B.C. have referred to the need to receive the equivalent of thefull proceeds of a television licence fee of  5 or even  6, in order to finance all these developments.
61. The Government accepts its responsibility to see that the B.B.C. hassufficient income to finance adequate services. The Committee recommend that theB.B.C. should continue to be financed solely by licence revenue; The Governmentagrees that the licence system should continue [but reserves for the time being on whether all the money required by the Corporation should be provided by meansof an increased licence fee or by other means]. &quot;    ,Borrowing62. The Government accepts the Committee recommendations thai the B.B.C.should have power to borrow up to  10 million for temporary bankingaccommodation, and up to  20 million for capital purposes, the latter subject, as now, to the approval of the Postmaster-General. It agrees that borrowing wouldbe an appropriate means of meeting a fairly short term need for high capitalexpenditure over a limited period.IT.A. Finance63.   I.T.A. finance is dealt with in Part III.Advertising Time, Standards and Practices64. In its appraisal of advertising time and practices the Committee conclude that an average of six minutes an hour, and a maximum of seven minutes an hour, is reasonable. They are against any legislative provision and this the Governmentaccepts. ,65. The Government also accepts the recommendation that advertisingmagazines should be abolished.66. The Television Act, by implication, does not permit subliminaladvertisements. The Committee suggest, and the Government agrees, that the banshould be made explicit in new legislation.67. Much argument has centred on the term &quot; natural break &quot;, used to denotethe time when advertisements may be inserted within programmes. It is an ideawhich everyone understands, some differently from others. The Committeerecognise the difficulty of defining the term, point out that the needs of goodbroadcasting should be paramount, and recommend that the Authority should keep the matter under review. In the Government view this does not go far enoughand it proposes to prohibit breaks (except between programmes) more frequentlythan once every 20 minutes within programmes.68. The Committee recommend amplification of the I.T.A.Y Principles 1 of advertising to give additional guidance on the permissible content of advertisements,and the formulation of I.T.A. case-law. They suggest that the nature of the appealmade by some advertisements is socially undesirable. The Government proposesto discuss these matters with the I.T.A. and also advertisements during children&apos;sprogrammes and the question of advertisements for medical treatments and preparations. In this context the Government has in mind a statutory requirement that all medical advertisements should be referred to a panel of medical consultantsto be appointed by the I.T.A. after consultation with professional organisationsaccepted as appropriate by the Postmaster-General.Relay69. The relay companies, which distribute broadcast programmes tosubscribers over wires, operate under licences from the Postmaster-General whichrun until 31st December, 1967. The Committee recommend that these licencesberenewed for a period expiring on the same date (July 1976) as the Charter and television Act. The Government proposes to offer the companies new licencesrunning for 12 years after the present licence expires. The present restrictionwhereby the companies are not allowed to originate their own programmes will becontinued: wm\ qi;s m^m^s-fri fi::f;        bus a^bvV&apos; r:-&apos;y       l ;:---^lr^i\-:y; 70. The Government will consider the Committee&apos;s recommendations On the detailed provisions of the Relay Licence when the terms of the new licence are drawnup. It cannot, however, accept the recommendation that the companies&apos; obligationto ensure that their subscribers hold broadcast receiving licences should&apos; beSECRET60988 B
abandoned. Subscribers should know that licences must be taken out and it is reasonable to expect the companies, whose function it is to supply a service which requires a licence, to see that one is held.71. The Government looks to the I.T.A. and Relay Services Association toconsider afresh the arrangements for distributing independent television programmes in the light of the Committee&apos;s comments, and to submit their views tothe Postmaster-General.Music-by-Wire Services72. The Government accepts the Committee&apos;s recommendation that thereshould be no extension of the music-by-wire services to other than business premises,and that no radio frequencies should be allotted to it.Isle of Man Future Sound and Television Services73. The Government will continue its discussions with the Isle of ManGovernment on this matter.Staff Conditions of Employment74. In the 1952 White Paper on Broadcasting (Cmd. 8550), paragraph 37, theB.B.C. were enjoined, in fixing the salaries and conditions of their staff, to take account of the Government&apos;s general policy on wages and kindred matters. this obligation continues and must extend to the I.T.A.PART III75. This section deals with recommendations on which the Governmenthas felt it right to reserve its position for the time being.Local Sound Broadcasting76. The Committee consider that,a &quot;sustained and broadly-based trial&quot; oflocal sound broadcasting is justified. They recommend this should be entrusted to the B.B.C., on the ground that local broadcasting by anyone else would require a new public corporation to control standards and to ensure impartiality. Ofcommercial operation in particular, they argue that it would set up new localcommercial monopolies, probably interested in setting up a network of independentstations. In the Committee&apos;s view a two-tier system of commercial companies and a controlling corporation would repeat what they consider to be an organicdefect in independent television (paragraph 8.1 below), aggravated in the caseof commercial local broadcasting by the difficulty of supervising a multitude ofsmall bodies. They also point out that the position of local newspapers wouldbe a further source of difficulty in a commercial system. To include them might lead to a dangerous concentration of the media of communication; to exclude them would endanger their existence.77. The Government agrees that the justification for local sound broadcasting would, be the provision of a service genuinely &quot; local &quot; in character.As yet, however, there has been little evidence of any general public demand forthis and the Government would be loath to &quot; create &quot; extra demand on resources which, for the present, should be concentrated on national requirements. Theresources of the B.B.C. are likely to be fully stretched in undertaking theinnovations dealt with in Section II. Moreover, a full service of local broadcasting,as the B.B.C. envisage it, would cost the equivalent of 5s. extra on sound licences.78. The Government would, therefore, prefer to take cognisance of public reaction before reaching a decision.The Future of Independent Television - ,79. An untried system was brought into being by the Television Act, 1954. Itintroduced a novel partnership between public and.private enterprise, producing
between them lively and certainly popular television. The government recognised at the time that the system would need re-examination after some yearsof operation.80. In some ways the system has been very successful. The evidence suggeststhat more people watch its programmes than those of the B.B.C. In some fields-for example light theatre, news and religious broadcasting it has undeniablycontributed something of value to television and by bringing competition intothe world of television exercised an enlivening effect on television in general.81. The Committee recommended a radical change in the future arrangements for independent television, both structurally and financially. TheI.T.A., they say, should sell the advertising time, make some programmesthemselves and buy others from the programme companies, who would continue to operate under contract to the I.T.A. but solely as programme producers. TheCommittee&apos;s main argument is that in the context of the present structure it isimpossible fully to reconcile the commercial purpose of the companies withthe realisation of the &quot; purposes of broadcasting &quot;.82. The Government feels that so fundamental a proposal requires the mostthorough examination, and that it must be satisfied that any new structure would succeed in remedying the defects it was designed to overcome and would notthrow up equally serious difficulties of its own or deprive the system of thosequalities for which it can fairly claim credit. Most important, the government must be convinced that the Committee&apos;s proposals, operated against the background of two B.B.C. programmes, would lead to better balanced programmes.83. For these reasons the Government feels that more thought must begiven to the Committee&apos;s recommendations. Its final proposals will be framedafter further consideration following debates in Parliament.84. The Government considers there will be scope at a later stage for asecond I.T.A. programme. But its timetable, as well as its exact shape, must await the solution of the problem briefly discussed in the foregoing paragraphs.85. Other questions on which the Committee have commented in regardto the nature of programme companies and the relationship of the Press totelevision will also turn on the central point described above.Pay-television86. Pay-television is a service whereby the subscribers would pay for eachtelevision programme viewed on their sets. The Committee recommend againstpay-television. They think that, if successful, it would impoverish the existingtelevision services by outbidding them for material; would be compelled to pursue the biggest audience in order to pay its way; and would be unlikely to enlarge thepresent range of programmes. They also think that it is the most expensive wayof providing another television service to viewers, limited to those who could afford it.87. Different people envisage pay-television as operating in different ways.Some see it simply as providing a cinema in the home, by wire only; others see itas a broadcasting service for new films, complete West End stage productions,championship boxing matches, special educational programmes, which viewerscannot now see.88. The Government will take cognisance of the Committee&apos;s arguments andfor the present reserves its decision on pay-television. It should be noted that the frequencies available, if two more national services are authorised and provision is to be made for a changeover to 625 lines (paragraph 45), would not leave room for a service of pay-television over the air, on any general scale, for some time tocome.  This objection would not apply to a service provided by wire.Television for Public Showing89. This means televising a programme or event for display on a big screenin a number of public places cinemas and theatres where the public would pay to see it.90. The Committee recommend against this on the same general grounds asthey recommend against pay-television (paragraph 86).
91. The Government feels there may be a place for this and its presentdisposition is to consider applications to provide such a service, each applicationbeing considered individually on its merits for the time being. Naturally therewould be no question of public spectacles and sporting events of overwhelmingpublic interest being &quot; cornered &quot; for &quot; public showing &quot; taken away from theB.B.C. and I.T.A.Party Political Broadcasting92.
