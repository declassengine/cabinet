Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1962C (62) 110 Copy No.     5910th July, 1962CABINETSMOKING AND HEALTHMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and minister for science the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Education, the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of Health, the Postmaster-General, theMinister of State, Home Office, the Economic Secretary, Treasury, and I have examined the report of the Royal College of Physicians about smoking and health,have reached the following conclusions and recommend the following action.Government Publicity2. Pamphlets and posters are already being distributed to local health and education authorities. This work should be continued and extended, but willnot by itself be enough to make much impact on the smoking habits of adults.So long as adults continue to smoke as much as they do now, the chances of preventing the children from acquiring the habit are reduced. Example is more powerful than precept. What is needed is a wider campaign directed to thepublic at large. In such a campaign it will be impossible to maintain a distinctionbetween material which gives the facts and material which tries to persuade. Theobject of giving the facts will be to persuade and this must be recognised.3. After consideration we rejected, at least at the present stage, a campaigninvolving the Government in hiring poster sites and paying for advertisements.The cost would be at least  1 million a year, and would at this figure still compare unfavourably with the volume and quality of the competing advertisements of manufacturers. This comparison alone would almost inevitably lead to pressure on the Government to take compulsory powers to control all tobacco advertising.It would be thought intolerable to have a Government poster, advising peoplenot to smoke and put up at great expense to the taxpayer, flanked by larger postersurging them to smoke a particular brand of cigarettes. Thus a poster campaignwould obviously involve the Government in very controversial actions and legislation, which in our view would not be supported by public opinion. we considered that there was every hope of a more modest campaign scientificallypursued having worthwhile results.4. We therefore recommend that the maximum use should be made of thefree publicity which the influence and authority of the Government can command.This, which is somewhat more extensive than is generally realised, will mean theprovision of material to be used in the Press and on radio and television by ministers, Members of Parliament, local authorities, societies and individuals.Publicity will also be obtained by distributing pamphlets and other material to post Offices, Government Establishments, doctors, churches, youth clubs, localauthorities and organisations promoting physical fitness. There is also thepossibility of &quot; trend setting &quot;, which means giving non-smoking a social cachet.this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government
Tobacco Advertising5. In various ways the tobacco manufacturers are at present spending 11 million a year on tobacco advertising. It has been suggested that it will beimpossible to reduce the present level of smoking if advertising goes on at this rate unchecked, and that the Government are inhibited from taking action bythe financial interests involved. While the last suggestion can be discounted, itis unfortunately the case that the compulsory control of advertising would bedifficult to achieve. Unless all tobacco advertising were simply to be prohibited itwould be a matter of great difficulty to define the scale and nature of the advertisingwhich was to be permitted. Nor would a levy on tobacco advertisements be likelyto do much good. Costs would probably be passed on to the consumer and theevidence is that the content of tobacco advertising is at least as important as itsvolume. Moreover an endeavour to prohibit or censor the contents ofadvertisement in one field of this importance would lead to pressure to adoptsimilar measures in a large number of other industries -liquor, medicines, sweetsand consumer goods of all sorts.6. But there is room for much voluntary action. The Independent television authority (I.T.A.) are already convinced that changes must be made in the themesused in certain advertisements and if necessary will use the statutory powers oftheir Advertising Advisory Committee to achieve this. The Postmaster-Generalalso has power to give directions about methods of advertising but, if the I.T.A. are successful, there will be no need for him to use them.7. Voluntary action in other publicity media will, depend on the attitude ofthe newspaper proprietors, the owners of hoardings and the manufacturersthemselves. The manufacturers may well be prepared to co-operate by reducingthe scale and modifying the content of their publicity, particularly for cigarettes.Sale of Tobacco to Children8. The existing law makes it an offence to sell cigarettes to a person apparentlyunder the age of 16 and enables a court to take steps to prevent a slot machine beingextensively used by persons under 16. The maximum penalties for the sale ofcigarettes to children are  2 for the first,  5 for the second and  10 for each subsequent offence; for failing to bring a slot machine under proper control inaccordance with a court order, the maximum penalty is  5 with up to  1 a day foreach day the offence continues.9. These maximum penalties were fixed at a time when the value of money was a good deal more and we recommend that they should be increased to at least 25,  50 and  100 for sale to children with corresponding increases for slotmachines. It must be recognised, however, that this will be more a political thana practical gesture. Convictions under the existing law are notoriously difficultto obtain, and an increase in the maximum penalty will not improve the detectionrate.10. We have Considered whether it would be right to enable a court to preventtobacco being sold at all in cases where sales to children can be shown to have takenplace. After a full examination we are clear that this would be unproductive.Apart from the technical difficulties involved in defining and enforcing such a prohibition, we should be under strong pressure to reserve the power to impose theprohibition to the superior courts; the difficulties in securing a conviction whichare already formidable would be multiplied if cases had to be tried before a jury.In other words, legislation would be complicated and would be likely to remain a dead letter. The real safeguard here must be a radical alteration in the attitudeof the public to smoking by children.Action of this kind, to be effective, needs to be planned and to be continued overa long period. It would be necessary to make clear from the outset that we donot expect quick results. A steering group to co-ordinate all publicity could beset up under the general control of the Health Departments with representativesof the Education Departments, the Central Office of Information, the localauthorities associations, and the doctors. Other representatives could be brought in as necessary.  A campaign on these lines might cost  40,000-50,000 per year.
Smoking in Public Places11. We do not recommend legislation to prevent smoking in public places.So long as the managers of, e.g., cinemas, restaurants and shops, believe that a banon smoking would damage their trade, they would be unlikely to co-operate. Thedifficulties of enforcement would be greatly increased and it would probably benecessary to put the burden on the police rather than on the management by makingsmoking in prohibited places an offence. We leave the results to the imaginationof our colleagues.12. Here again an improvement can only come about when there has beena change in public opinion and we should do all we can to encourage voluntaryaction to this end. There is a strong case for discouraging smoking in stores,particularly those of the supermarket type where food is sold. Messrs. Marksand Spencer have already shown the way and we must do what we can to encourageother organisations to follow suit.13. The Government should themselves take a lead in this by putting up&quot; Please do not smoke &quot; signs in suitable Government premises to which the public have regular access. It would be unwise to enforce these notices by legal means,but we can reasonably look to the co-operation of the public and the help of the staffs of those offices in seeing that the ban is effective. The signs might be coupled with one of the posters showing the dangers of smoking.14. The same considerations apply to public and municipal transport. Forthe most part smoking can be prohibited on railways or buses under the relevantbye-laws. We should encourage the competent authorities to review the presentscales of non-smoking accommodation and increase them where possible.Taxation15. We have been unable to reach an agreed view about imposition of a differential tax which would make cigarettes more expensive and pipe tobaccoand cigars cheaper. It would be possible, by recasting the present tax structure,to devise such a tax; but in the view of the Customs and Excise if it were substantialenough to have any real impact, ways and means could easily be found of avoidingit. We agreed that if imposed it should not be so high, e.g., a 50 or 100 per cent,increase in the price of cigarettes, as to produce an immediate and substantialeffect. Such a tax would be manifestly unfair to the poor and as mentioned abovecould be widely evaded. We also agreed that a differential tax should not be solow that it would be written off as a mere political gesture.16. But some of us considered that there would be merit in a differential taxwhich would have a marginal effect on consumption, e.g., by raising the price ofa packet of cigarettes by say 10 per cent, (from 4s. 6d. to 5s.) and by droppingthe price of pipe tobacco by 20 per cent, or so. In favour of such a course it couldbe argued that taken in conjunction with the other measures which we recommend it would show that the Government take the cigarette problem seriously, and thatconversely it would be wrong for the Government to refrain from making a positive move in the one field in which it is obviously open for them to do so. Itmight also produce over a period a significant change in smoking habits, since itwould reinforce the effect of our general publicity. It would, in other words,provide a practical incentive to cut down smoking or to change to a pipe, whereas in the absence of such an incentive the publicity might result in no more than goodintentions. There is some evidence from earlier surveys that many smokers wouldlike to cut down, but need some positive spur before actually doing so. Moreover,if the measures we have recommended above have any effect at all and it wouldbe a counsel of despair to assume they would not the Revenue will be the loserunless counter-measures are taken.17. As against this it must be admitted that even a small differential tax would bear hardly on the poor and the old, for many of whom smoking is a realsolace and who, particularly the women, would find it difficult or impossible to change the habit of a life time. And if the Royal College are right (though theyare hardly qualified to express the opinion) in saying that, on the basis of theevidence, increased taxation would be unlikely to have any lasting effect, we mightbe inflicting hardship to no good purpose. Furthermore, it is the view of theCustoms and Excise that increased taxation would be unlikely to have any lastingeffect on the demand for cigarettes unless the differential were sufficient to raise
the retail price of cigarettes by 50 per cent, at least, and possibly by nearer 100 percent. A differential tax might also be criticised in principle as a wrong use oftaxation.18.   We seek the views of the Cabinet on this point.Other Measures19. We do not recommend that cigarette packets should be marked by anofficial agency to show the yield of tar, volatile irritants and nicotine per grammeof cigarette. In the first place it has not been possible to establish any directconnection between these substances and lung cancer and the knowledge thatcertain brands of cigarettes had a comparatively low yield might encourage a falsesense of confidence. In the second place, the yield would probably have to be expressed in terms of a maximum, i.e., &quot; the contents of this package areguaranteed not to produce more than x grammes of tar, etc.&quot;. This again mighttend to encourage rather than discourage the smoker.20. The Royal College recommend organisation of experimental anti-smoking clinics. This recommendation has already been accepted in principle bythe Ministry of Health. A small number of experimental anti-smoking clinicswill be set up and the results will be reviewed in about two years&apos; time.21. It has been agreed to charge no duty on cigarettes used in research bythe tobacco industry into the harmful effects of smoking. Publicity would not normally be given to an extra-statutory concession of this sort, but it may be worthmentioning in any general statement of the action we are taking. The concessionwill not become an awkward precedent.Summary22. Subject to a decision about taxation I invite the Cabinet to agree that action should proceed on the lines I have suggested and to authorise me toco-ordinate action in consultation with the other Ministers concerned. It wouldalso be advisable to announce in Parliament the results of our consideration of theRoyal College&apos;s report and if the Cabinet accept my views I will arrange for thepreparation of a draft statement by the Prime Minister. tHAILSHAM.Office of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science, S.W. 1.9th July, 1962.
