&apos;     1THIS ftdlMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).C. (62) 103 COPY NO. ^^ j-27th June. 1962CABINETBROADCASTING AND TELEVISIONMpmnr^ndum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster GeneralThe words in square brackets in paragraph 61 of the draft white Paper (circulated with C. (62) 102) imply that a second british broadcasting Corporation (B. B. C. ) television programme and other possible B. B. C, developments may be able to be financed by meansother than by increasing the licence fee.   Behind this lies, in particular,the possible use of revenue from advertising on commercial television.2,        None of my colleagues would, I am sure, think of financingB.B.C, programmes from ordinary revenue.   Using commercial tele-vision profits may not appear to amount to this, but Exchequer revenueis not spent according to its source;  for example, motor taxationrevenue is not spent wholly on motorists.   Apart from licence fees,an Exchequer subsidy - direct or indirect - is, in effect, the only means of financing additional B. B.C. expenditure.3.        Expenditure on existing Governmental services is rising faster than revenue.   So far from being able to reduce taxes, we are faced withthe prospect of having to increase thern.   In these circumstances theExchequer cannot afford to take On avoidable fresh commitments, or tohypothecate new or increased revenue to fresh forms of expenditure.4.        The Pilkington Committee recommend without equivocation thatthe B. E. C.  should continue to be paid for exclusively out of licence revenue.   Even if the television licence fee were to be doubled, thecost to each family would rise only from Is. 2d. to 2s. 4d. a week -roughly the price of ten cigarettes,5.        It may be that my colleagues are not at this stage ready toaccept this particular recommendation of the Pilkington Committee asit stands (although I greatly hope that their eventual decision will be infavour of doing so), but that they may want first to test the public reaction.If this is so, it would surely be a grave tactical mistake for the Govern-ment to go out of their way to throw doubt on this extremely importantrecommendation.   We have nothing whatever to gain by doing so, butmuch to lose.   To do so would encourage the very pressures which itis clearly in the Governments genez*al interests to re strain.   Moreover,for the public the issue for consideration would become blurred, as thepublic would be invited to express views on the possible expansion of television without kiowingwho would be expected to pay for it.6.        If we say nothing, we lose nothing.   I urge therefore that in thepresent White Paper we make no comment at all on this recommendationof the Pilkington Committee - unless, of course, we are ready to saythat we endorse it.H.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.27th June, 1962
