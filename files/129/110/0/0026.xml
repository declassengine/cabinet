104CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of Statefor War and the Secretary of State for air the Chief Secretary, Treasury, puts the issue of the responsibility for salesand purchases of Service land as a test case of the Governments earnestness insearching for administrative economies (C. (62) 119). In our view there would beno economies in his proposal. There would be a serious loss of efficiency.History from 1922 to 19582. The Howard Frank Committee were asked to examine the question of concentrating all lands work (not only the valuation part of it) in one Department.They recommended that lands work for all Departments should go to a CentralLands Department, not to the Inland Revenue. The Government of the day didnot accept this.3. In 1949 a committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Sir ArtonWilson. No formal report was published, but the committee reached the view thatcentralisation of valuation work in the Valuation Office would lead to delays, toduplication of work of professional staffs, and possibly to a small increase in clerical staff.4. The Select Committee on Estimates, 1957-58, received a paper from theTreasury advocating that valuation should be carried out entirely by the ValuationOffice. The Service Departments had no comparable opportunity to put their side of the case. The Treasury did not then claim that substantial savings in staff would result from transferring valuation work.The Warter Committee, 19615. The Warter Committee based their case on two points: the greater widthof experience of the District Valuer, and the suggestion that it may be easier for the valuation Office to recruit good professional men. These are the only reasonsthey give for their conclusions, and we consider both to be unsound. Their reportentirely ignores the case which the Service Departments put to them aboutadministrative efficiency.The Technical Question of Valuation6. The District Valuers have a very wide range of experience, but we do notconsider that this makes them better able to give a proper valuation of Serviceproperty. The Service Departments&apos; valuers have immediately available a country-wide experience of recent sale values of the types of property, often specialist innature, which the Service Departments are putting on the market. The DistrictValuer can always be consulted, and is consulted where necessary.   There is noPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1962C. (62) 12627th July, 1962.Copy No.  5 9CABINETSERVICE LANDS BRANCHES
particular difficulty about the effect of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1959,and no difficulty over the Service Departments&apos; valuers ascertaining the attitudesof local authorities. Indeed this is a normal part of their work. No evidence hasbeen produced to show that valuations made by the Valuation Department are more accurate than those made by our valuers.The Question of Administrative Efficiency7. Our valuers are an integral part of the Service Departments. They havethe closest contacts with the finance, administrative and Service staffs involved with lands projects. They are in continual contact with the Service Lands staffsall over the country. Use of the Valuation Office would mean either routing allinstructions to District Valuers through Somerset House, or dealing direct with a hundred or more District Valuers throughout the country. Such a process mustcause delay. We have experience of it, because we are required to use the valuation Office in cases of disposing of land to former owners. Experience showsthat something like an additional three months is added to the time to deal withsuch cases, and in a recent example 17 letters had to be written to the DistrictValuer.8. Our Departments are currently engaged on a large-scale plan for thedisposal of surplus land and properties, which will inevitably take some years tocomplete. There is already a good deal of criticism in Parliament and the newspapers of delays in disposal. The Committee&apos;s proposals would put the extra link in the chain in all cases.9. We are not buying much land now but purchases can be important. TheAir Ministry, in particular, come under pressure from the United States authorities on operational grounds to accelerate the acquisition of sites for their forces in thiscountry. Purchases of this kind usually involve complicated negotiations and,not infrequently, it is necessary to ask the United States authorities if they can accept some alternative site. All this must be done by the Air Ministry and itwould be an unnecessary, tiresome and potentially embarrassing complication tohave to bring yet another party into the procedures.10. The Admiralty hold much less land than the other two Departments and do not have as many important purchases and sales. This largely explains whytheir procedures are somewhat different in that they use District Valuers for about two-thirds of their purchases and a third of their sales. The Admiralty find, in common with the other Departments, that reference to the District Valuer does(quite naturally) involve a great deal more time and effort than is needed forinstructing their own surveyors. This is quite contrary to the opinion adoptedin the conclusions of the Committee&apos;s report.11. Buying and selling lands and properties forms only a small but important part of the whole business of Service Lands management. For this reason, if thework of valuation and negotiation were transferred, no comparable savings in staff would result. On the contrary additional effort would be involved in thepreparation of instructions to the District Valuers. Accordingly, we considerthat there would be no staff economies.12. Lands business is politically highly sensitive. A large proportion ofour Parliamentary Questions and ministerial correspondence is concerned with it. These matters are by their nature complex and take time. If further delayis involved, as it must be under the committee&apos;s proposals, we shall only be accused, and rightly so, of administrative inefficiency. As Service ministers responsible for land and buildings all over the country, it is not unreasonablethat we shall be directly responsible for our affairs; as are the other largeland owning and property owning departments, the Ministry of Works and theMinistry of Agriculture.13. Then there is the special question of work overseas. Our lands officersoverseas are used to dealing every day with the particular requirements of theServices, in a way that would not be possible for men seconded from the valuation Office, who would be lacking in Service background and in experienceof the important management responsibilities which are the biggest part of landswork overseas. The secondment of staff would quite simply be less efficient.
Conclusion15. We consider that the Warter Committee&apos;s proposals would not produceeconomies, would impair efficiency, and would add to the political difficulties.We therefore ask the Cabinet to endorse the principles which govern Service Landswork to-day. If this is done, our Departments will be ready to consider with the valuation Office whether there are any adjustments that should be made to obtaingreater efficiency and economy.C.J. P.H. F.26th July, 1962.14. Finally, there is the committee&apos;s view that the Service Departments mayhave difficulty in attracting suitable staff for their valuation work. On the basisof past experience we do not agree, and it is the Valuation Office, rather than theService Departments, who are short of professional staff. The real danger is that,if the cream of the professional work were skimmed off, the Service LandsBranches would not be able to attract the quantity and quality of professionalstaff they need.
