In view of the achievement of independence by so many of these territories it isdesirable to widen the Corporation^ terms of reference, without howeverincreasing the statutory ceiling of Exchequer lending.2.     Accordingly, I ask the Cabinet to agree:-(a) that the Corporation shall be permitted to embark on new projects in any former British colonial or mandated territory which after 1948 achieved, or may hereafterachieve, independence within the Commonwealth;(b) that the name of the Corporation shall be changed to&quot; Common wealth Development Corporation&quot;;(c) that the necessary legislation should be introduced next session;  and(d) that I should be authorised.to make an announcement to this effect before the House rises.D.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.
