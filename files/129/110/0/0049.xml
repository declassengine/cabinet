SECRET 000wwwTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)QjS^LMI COPY NO. j6^JCABINETRAILWAYMEN&apos;S WAGE C LAIMMemorandum by the Minister of transport i suggest there are five crucial questions on which we ought to concentrate.     These are:-(i)  Effective date of increase,(ii)  Relationship with General Wages Policy.(iii) The position of the Chairman of the british transport Commission, Dr. Beeching.(iv) Tactics to be employed,(v)  Finance.(i)  Effective date of increase2.      Should the increase be effective as soon as it is awarded or should we try to push the effective date into 1963 ?    What is at stakehere is not the  5 million or  6 million for the last quarter of theyear.    It is the position of a railway settlement in the wage cycle.If the increase is effective this year it will come at the tail end ofthe latest wage cycle.     That is why Dr. Beeching thinks that1 st October or thereabouts is the right date, and he has explained his reasons fully to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(ii)  Relationship with General Wages policy.      The railwaymen themselves have based their claims oncomparability.    As matters stand on the railways, it would havebeen difficult for them to find other grounds.    If Dr. Beeching, asI expect, finally proposes a figure of 6 per cent, he will no doubt have in mind, as would the head of any commercial undertaking, theneed to take account of the feelings of the individuals who work for him, and in whose minds comparability still looms large.-1-
4.      But -(a) A 6 per cent increase falls short, by more than one-third,of comparability with wage increases in the industriestaken by the Guillebaud Committee for comparisonpurposes.    What has actually happened is shown in the annex to this paper.    From this, it can be seen thatin these industries there have been increases since january, I960, in hourly rates ranging from13 per cent to over 22 per cent, whilst the railways&apos;increase has been less than 8 per cent.    How far canthese increases for the &quot;Guillebaud industries&quot; bejustified on grounds of productivity?    The M-ratedworkers, whose pay is the responsibility of the Govem-ment, have advanced by nearly 15 per cent.(b) Dr. Beeching has also to consider how best to carry throughthe immense industrial re-organisation which has been entrusted to him by the Government.    How can he do this is his workers are dissatisfied and if there is no prospect tha.t workers on the railway system which will emerge are to be satisfactorily paid?    We cannotconvert the railways from being a depressed industryif we ignore the feelings of the 350, 000 or so workers who will still be required to run it, even during the run-down, often in conditions which demand greaterrisks and greater responsibilities than are found else-rwhere.    A great industry cannot be properly runwithout good morale.(iii) The position of Dr. Beeching;5.      To some extent, Dr. Beeching is asking us to back his judgment as the man in charge of the railways - and indeed our own judgement in putting him there.     I believe that his selection hasalready fully justified itself.     The progress made in his 16 months in office has been enormous.    His is the first serious effort to getthe railways down to the right size and shape.    And they need it.The Times leading article for 27th September points out that therailways are like the ports.    It is a &quot;picture of mass obsolescence,inadequate investment, out-of-date practices and facilities, and prospective redundancy because their present form and outlook were largely moulded more than half a century ago and times are changingfast&quot;.    For the first time for years the railways are being properlymanaged.-    It is not only the first effort at real management of thesystem as a whole:  if Dr. Beeching resigns it may well be the last.I cannot envisage anyone else who, upon Dr. Beeching&apos;s resignation(in the circumstances we must envisage), would undertake the job,or if he did, could achieve the results which we all need, not least the taxpayer.    Nor can I see anyone else getting the confidence of railwaymen.    I do not believe that the latest events have affectedhis relationship with his staff to the&apos; extent that they could notrapidly be repaired.
(iv) The tactics to be^emglqyed6.      I myself am not wholly convinced about Dr, Beeching&apos;s tactics.His experience has led him to believe that the duty of managementis to propose whatever course they believe to be right, rather thanallow that course to be &quot;negotiated out of them&quot;.    It is quite possible that the railways are not yet ready for this.    Tactics are,of course - like wages - normally left to managements; but I would expect that, if we back Dr. Beeching&apos;s judgment on the 6 per cent (if that is the figure he finally puts forward), I would be able to persuade him to take the position that the 6 per cent should be his last offerrather than his first one.(v) Financje7.      The Minister of Labour in his paper C. (62) 143 emphasises,very fairly, that 6 per cent means  24 million per annum, while3 per cent or 4 per cent means very much less.     But this is not thewhole story.     Just as in the case of the Workshops we have agreedto once and for all redundancy payments totalling   6 -7 million withan eye to getting an eventual saving of something like  30 million ayear, so we should regard a 6 per cent increase as an investmentwithout which the re-organisation of the railways - which is now acornerstone of our own policy - cannot be efficiently carried through.It will be difficult in any case:  with dissatisfied workpeople it willbe far more difficult.    And without Dr. Beeching it may beimpossible.E. M,Ministry of Transport, S. E. 1.1st October, 1962.-3-
