(62) 1502nd October, 1962CABINETSUPPLY OF DEFENSIVE MISSILES TO ISRAEL AND ARAB COUNTRIESNote by the Minister of State for Foreign affairs on 20th September the Cabinet, before deciding whether we should express a readiness to supply any country in the Middle East with ground-to-air missiles,asked the Foreign Secretary to arrange, in consultation with the Minister ofDefence and the Minister of Aviation, for a review of the present state of missileequipment of the countries of the Middle East, of the scope for increasing it andof the political and economic implications of so doing; and to consider in thelight of this review the terms in which the United Kingdom Government mightannounce their readiness to supply missiles to Middle East countries, once theterms of the United States offer to supply missiles to Israel had become known.(C.C. (62) 57th Conclusions, Minute 3.)2. The attached memorandum has accordingly been prepared in consultationwith officials of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation. It hasnot yet been seen by. the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence or the Ministerof Aviation, but is being circulated in view of the urgency of the matter.DUNDEE.Foreign Office, S.W.1,2nd October, 1962.1491a
2TOP SECRETAnnexTHE SUPPLY OF DEFENSIVE MISSILES TO ISRAEL AND ARABCOUNTRIESMemorandum by Officialsr Existing. OffersThis paper deals with ground-to-air missiles. Details about all types ofmissiles being supplied to the Middle East are at Appendix A. Secret reports have reached us that Soviet ground-to-air missiles will be supplied to Iraq andthe United Arab Republic in 1963 or 1964; we believe that Syria may also receive them in due course. The Israelis who have made enquiries of the United Statesand ourselves about the supply of such weapons from time to time were informed in August by the United States Government of their readiness to make themavailable and this has now become public knowledge. Delivery could not takeplace until the end of 1963 and training requires 65 weeks. For political reasons the Israelis are virtually certain to want to buy from the United States rather thanus. The United States Government will also say that they are ready to considerapplications from Arab countries.2. No British ground-to-air missiles have been supplied to any countries inthe area and there seems to be no question of the supply by the French or anyothers for the foreseeable future.Potential Demand and Availability of British Missiles3. The scope for increasing Middle East countries&apos; holding of these weaponsis difficult to determine. It is probable that Arab countries will not wish to havethe same weapon as Israel. If, as seems likely, Israel purchases Hawk, then theArabs might want Bloodhound or Thunderbird. Sales of such missiles mightbe made to Kuwait and Jordan, and also more doubtfully to Lebanon, SaudiArabia and Syria, and even conceivably to Egypt. Possibly more promising salesprospects also exist for smaller cheaper missiles such as the naval Seacat and itsland-based version Tigercat. Brief notes on potential demand country by country are at Appendix B.4. Having regard to the impact of United States (and Soviet) competition,and also to the ability of potential customers to pay, the volume of business accruing to-the United Kingdom is not likely to be worth more than, say,  10 million.5. The production of Bloodhound I and Thunderbird I has already lapsed.Supply of Mark I missiles would have to come from the Services as re-equipmentwith Mark II missiles renders them surplus to Service requirements. Bloodhound i could not be supplied before 1963 or 1964. Surplus Thunderbird Mark I fromthe army could not be made available before 1966-67, though some Thunderbirdsfrom new production might become available before that date.6. The security position is complex but it is possible that some equipmentscould not be released to the Arabs as early as to the Israelis. Seacat and Tigercatcould probably be made available about two years from receipt of a firm order.Implications of a British Offer to Supply7. We have been very concerned at the repercussions in Arab countries ofour supplying to the Israelis. Our position in the Middle East is much moreexposed than that of the United States and, if the Arab countries should uniteagainst us on this issue, they could do us a great deal of harm in a number of ways. In particular the Chiefs of Staff are especially concerned that the supplyof United &quot;Kingdom missiles to the area should not have repercussions whichprejudice the staging and overflying facilities we enjoy with the Sudan and Libyaor our relations with Kuwait.8. If we offer to supply the Arabs as well as the Israelis this may mitigate the Arab reaction but the Arabs are likely to regard our offer as a cover for our
supplying Israel. In addition the supply of missiles to Arab countries raises thefollowing problems :(a) It is important politically to avoid discrimination in the delivery datesoffered to the Israelis and Arabs.(b) It may be politically difficult for us to supply to certain Arab countries,e.g., Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The military consequences of supplyingIraq are acceptable but this would be difficult to explain to publicopinion in the United Kingdom, and to the Kuwait Government, solong as the threat to Kuwait remains. In practice the Iraqis are unlikely to approach us. The military consequences of supplying to SaudiArabia are equally acceptable but if we did supply this might have abad effect on the Persian Gulf rulers.(c) We cannot discriminate between Arab countries in the supply of missileswithout running the risk of being accused of taking sides in Arabquarrels or of exposing those we supply to further accusations of beingBritish stooges (e.g., Kuwait or Jordan). Although the United arab republic would be likely to refuse United Kingdom missiles, as sheis already to receive them from the Russians, we should have to includeher in any offer, as to discriminate against her, whatever excuse weused, would produce a very bad effect.(d) Most of the other potential customers, e.g., Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Libyaand the Sudan, probably could not afford the bigger system such asBloodhound. Jordan in particular already depends on United Statesand United Kingdom aid to balance the budget.(e) From a military point or view there would be an operational advantage and some deterrent effect if Kuwait possessed surface-to-air missiles.But from a political point of view this would increase the risk of incidents with Iraq (e.g., through the Kuwaitis precipitately shootingdown Iraqi aircraft near the frontier) and it would divert funds whichcould be better used on other defence measures and on buying the friendship of other Arab States. Kuwait, moreover, could probablyonly operate less sophisticated equipment such as Tigercat, whichwould itself be less likely to cause incidents.9. Generally, we must avoid any action which stimulates the arms race inthe Middle East. This is a point to which Commonwealth Governments inparticular attach importance.10. On the other hand, the following factors weigh in favour of supplyingto the Arabs and the Israelis:(a) In the present state of the balance of payments even a small export order is important.(b) A decision not to supply would be a severe blow to the hopes of theUnited Kingdom manufacturers of missile systems who have alreadybeen severely affected by their exclusion from the North atlantic alliance market and the cancellation of several major projectsnotably Blue Water.(c) If United Kingdom equipment is excluded to the advantage of the americans and Russians the Arabs may not look to us so much fortraining or purchases in the field of electronics and aviation.(d) If ground-to-air missiles are to be supplied to the Middle East there wouldbe some military advantage if these were of United Kingdom. . manufacture   since   we   would   be   better   informed   about   theirpotentialities and could take them into account in our militaryplanning.(e) Only defensive weapons would be involved and it will be difficult for usto refuse to supply now that the Russians and Americans are ready todo SO. - -11.   We have consulted Her Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the area about:id) The repercussions of the United States offer.-The United States offer tothe Israelis which was made public last week has drawn a good deal,of fire from the Arabs which we have escaped thanks to our decisionto stand back.TOP SECRET1491 a 2
4 TOP SECRET(b) The advisability of our expressing our readiness to supply missiles to theArabs and Israelis. The consensus of opinion among Her Majesty&apos;representatives is that it would be better for us not to supply anymissiles to the area, since this will run counter to our policy of non-involvement, and that the next best thing is to express privately to theArabs and Israelis a readiness to supply. This offer should if possiblebe made with a little delay in order to avoid any appearance that wewere parties to the United States decision. However presented our action would prompt doubts about the sincerity of our statements about not; contributing to an arms race in the area. Furthermore, it will divertresources from economic development.12. The reports from posts suggest that provided that we do not discriminate against them as regards either the offer to sell or the supply of missiles the Arabs&apos;reactions should not be such as would endanger our strategic interests: viz. out-staging and overflying rights or our relations with Kuwait (see paragraph 7 above).We suggest therefore that what we have to weigh are the economic advantages ofmissile sales in the Middle East, together with the domestic political implications of leaving the field to the Russians and Americans, against the political repercussions in the area.Courses Open13.   There are two broad courses open to us:(a) To refuse to supply.(b) To indicate to all countries in the area that we are ready to examineindividual requests on their merits.14.   If course (b) is adopted we suggest the following procedure:(a) The first step should be to inform the United States and french governments, with whom we have always concerted our Middle Eastarms policy and who were partners with us in the Tripartite Declarationof 1950. It is particularly important to warn the United States since we try to follow a common policy towards the different Arab countries,and in the case of Jordan share responsibility for its financial viability.Should the Americans raise objections based on our securityagreements with them, we should remind them that we had reservedour right to offer our missiles if they offered Hawk.(b) We should then instruct Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in the Middle Eastcapitals to make a communication on the following lines: &quot; Our policyremains that of contributing to peace and stability in the Middle East,but the situation has been changed by the indications that some countries in the area have or are likely soon to acquire modernsophisticated weapons. In this new situation we can no longer regard: ground-to-air defensive missiles as in principle different from weaponspreviously supplied. Should there be requests from countries in thearea for the supply of United Kingdom missiles, to meet their genuinedefensive needs we should now consider each case on its merits.&quot; Thiswould be done in Israel, the United Arab Republic, the Lebanon.Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya and the Sudan and Her Majesty&apos;ammbassadors in other surrounding countries such as Iran, Turkey andthe North African countries should have discretion to communicate it also.   Commonwealth countries would be informed as necessary.(c) We suggest that this communication should not be followed automaticallyby any public statement, which might be misinterpreted as indicating adisregard of the risks attached to the supply of modern weapons to an area which is showing itself as unstable as ever. If however we arepressed for a public statement in due course, we should clearly haveto respond.(d) Finally we suggest that we should avoid any initiatives (e.g., stimulatingdemand from Jordan) which are liable to involve us in a financial lossrather than a commercial benefit. Where they appear likely an approach from the country concerned should be handled initially ona Government-to-Government basis.2nd October, 1962.
Appendix ASupplies of Guided Missiles to Arab StatesIt has not been possible to confirm that any Arab country of the Middle Eastyet possesses any operational defensive guided missiles. However, there is onereport of the sighting of 19 missiles in Egypt, the description of which conformsclosely to that of Guideline (Soviet type SA-2 surface-to-air missile). There havealso been reports that delivery to Egypt has begun of Atoll air-to-air missiles forMiG-21 jet fighters, about 20 of which are already held by the United arab republic Air Force.2. There is abundant evidence of the present Soviet intention to supply tothe United Arab Republic and Iraq:Surface-to-air missiles (Guideline).Air-to-air missiles (Atoll).Air-to-surface missiles (Kennel).Missile-carrying fast patrol boats (probably not to Iraq).3. There are indications that the supply of similar missiles to Syria in due course is also probable. The fact that deliveries of missiles have been made to indonesia and Cuba suggests that the Soviet Union are at least not inhibited on grounds of security from the export of this type of equipment.4.   Iran has received Sidewinder air-to-air missiles from America.Supplies of Guided Missiles to Israel&apos;5. Israel has received 20-24 Mirage III aircraft (a total of 60 ordered) from france, but there is no evidence to suggest that air-to-air missiles (Matra) for them have yet been delivered, but it is assumed that they are on order.Supplies of Anti-tank Weapons6. Israel has French SS-10 and -11 wire-guided anti-tank weapons and Kuwaitwill have the British Vigilant weapon by the end of 1962. Iraq may have receiveda Russian equivalent.  This class of weapon is now considered as conventional.Appendix BPotential Demand for British Ground-to-Air Missiles in the Middle East CountriesIsrael is likely to buy the United States Hawk Missile.Kuwait may want to buy and could find the money.Lebanon is not likely to want to buy; could pay.Jordan will want to buy; has no money to spare.Syria is more likely to buy from the Russians; would need long credit.U.A.R. is unlikely to want to buy but could find the money.Libya not likely to want to buy; has no money.Sudan not likely to want to buy; has no money.Iraq not likely to want to buy.Saudi Arabia might want to buy; would want long credit.Iran may want missiles but is likely to expect them as free aid from the americans.The assessment above relates primarily to the class of bigger ground-to-airweapons, such as Bloodhound. There might be more scope for smallground-to-air weapons such as Seacat/Tigercat.October 1962.
