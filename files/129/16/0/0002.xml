(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S .E C E E TC. P. (47) 23rd January,  1947ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST SPAINMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs have been invited by my colleagues to state theprobable effects of the imposition of economic sanctions&apos;against Spain.      These effects would of course vary to someextent depending upon-whether sanctions were imposed byHis Majesty1 s Government acting unilaterally or by the;;United Nations or a number of them acting collectively.In either event, however,  it -must be assumed that theSpanish Government would react vigorously and in eitherevent the consequences to this country and the british people would be serious.These consequences are set out in detail in the annexed memorandum which has been drawn up after consultationwith the other interested government departments.      Briefly,the supply of   foodstuffs   essential to the diet of theBritish people would be seriously diminished;    theproduction of   foodstuffs   in this country would be materiallyreduced;    British heavy industry would be further hampered,If not curtailed, requirements of coal would rise and theoutput of steel .would probably fallr    and the production ofa wide range of consumer goods would be adversely   effected.I am advised that there is no effective action that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could take to avoid these grave effectsboth on our export drive and on the production of food and consumer goods for the home market.      The rupture of economic relations would also create fresh financial difficulties forHis Majesty&apos;s Government and seriously prejudice theinterests of British creditors, who after some years are inthe process of securing repayment from Spain.      Furthermore,the interests of British companies established in Spain,such as . the important Rio Tinto mines,  and of British shipping-companies .trading with Spain might-be seriously affected.In addition to these unfortunate consequences forthe material interests of this country,  the imposition ofeconomic sanctions against Spain by His Majesty&apos;s Government-might seriously impair the long term relations between thiscountry and the Spanish people.      This is a point whichcannot be overlooked in view of the fact that it has been consistently held that it Is in the strategic  interest of thiscountry that Spain and the Spanish people should be basicallyfriendly towards us.1 0    COPY NO.  &apos;:$ CABINET
To enforce the policy 0f economic sanctions wouldrequire the re-imposition of a large number of war timecontrols and procedures,  such as export  licences,  navicerts,control of shipping;, rationing of Portugal etc.      In thenature of things and even though a number of the united nations might be co-operating in the policy, much of this work of enforcement would inevitably fall upon this country.This would put an appreciable strain on our resources, bothin respect of finance and man-power and the fact that wewere largely responsible for the re-irnposition of thesewar time controls would inevitably tend to impair ourrelations with other foreign countries.It may be felt that I am unduly pessimisticand that if economic sanctions were applied firmly, Francowould collapse in a very few weeks and there would be no time for the unpleasant consequences referred to above to affect this country.      If,  however,  economic sanctions areto have this rapid effect it is essential that they shouldbe applied by as many foreign countries  as possible,  andit is essential that both the United States and theArgentine should co-operate fully.      In present circumstances,it is extremely unlikely that the Argentine would agree toco-operate,while the attitude of the United States, whichhave always been opposed to the idea of economic sanctions,of Brazil and some other Latin-American countries must bevery doubtful.      Indeed,  it   must be questionable whether some European countries who have appreciable commercialexchanges with Spain, such as Holland,  Switzerland orTurkey, would be at all enthusiastic about a policy ofeconomic sanctions.      There is thus,  I think, virtually no chance in the present circumstances of getting awatertight or effective system of economic sanctions againstSpain.      This means that there would be very little likelihood of Spain collapsing in a few weeks time as aresult of economic pressure or of this country escapingthe very unpleasant consequences of Spanish retaliation.Furthermore,  it means that unless we were prepared to try to interrupt by force trade between Spain and the argentine and any other countries who refused to apply the blockade - .a policy which would be bound to have the most serious consequences - we should be condemned to acquiesce In the continuation of what was a quite ineffective policy towardsSpain.It is frequently suggested that an embargo on oil supplies to Spain would suffice to bring about Franco1sdownfall.      For such an embargo to have any effect onSpain it would be necessary to secure full co-operation from the United States Government, since United states companies at present supply oil to Spain without restriction.Recent indications are that the United States Governmentwould not agree to cut off United States oil from Spain.If in these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government decidedto impose an embargo, they would merely deprive British-companies of a valuable market with probable prejudiceboth to -the future of the companies and to the financing of British purchases in Spain;    and without any reasonablehope of influencing the situation in Spain in. the desireddirection.
A final point which we&quot; cannot ignore is theeffect which a; policy of sanctions would have upon therelations between this country and Portugal.      In ordereffectively to control the imports  into Spain from overseas,  it would be necessary to introduce some systemof rationing imports into Portugal.      Apart from the inevitable dislocation and confusion which this would cause to Portuguese internal economy and the hardshipswhich it might impose on the Portuguese population, manyof whom are already finding life difficult,  the fact thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were the prime movers in thewhole policy would of necessity seriously impair ourrelations both with the Portuguese Government and thePortuguese people.      The former who are always nervouslest internal disturbances in Spain should spread to portugal and lead to a return to the pre-Salazar days when revolutions were almost an annual occurrence wouldresent this foreign interference in the affairs of theIberian Peninsula.      The latter would attribute theirincreasing economic difficulties  to the intervention ofthis country and would fail to understand the motivesbehind our action.      If as a result relations between this country and Portugal were permanently estranged,  theconsequences to us would be serious.      In the short term,we might lose many of the commercial advantages we arehoping to gain from trade with Portugal in the next fewyears.      In the long term we should lose the very valuablestragegic asset which the friendship of Portugal constitutesto the British Empire.E. B.Foreign Office,&apos; S. W. 1.3rd January,   1947.
ANNEXBRITISH IMPORTS FROM SPAINFOODThe following notes relate to the year ending31st March,  192+7.Spanish supplies of the following foodstuffs cannot he replaced from other sources:      sweet oranges, bananas,tomatoes, dried apricots and apricot pulp*      These commoditiescould not be foregone without adversely affecting the he alth ofthe British people.Fresh FruitWe are very short of fresh fruit,  and hardly importinga quarter of the pre-war volume.      Even though Spanish prices are generally high, sweet oranges, bananas and tomatoes are considered essential to us.      They could not he replaced fromother sources,  as the supplies of these from all possiblesources are- not sufficient to meet the demand.      The other items in the import programme (hitter orangos,  onions,  etc.)  could probably be bought elsewhere without serious&apos; difficulty.Dried Fruit_and NutsDried Apricots.      These add a much needed element of varietyto our diet.      It t unlikely that the programmed quantityof 2,000 tons could he obtained from any other source.      TheUnited States of America is an important source of suchcommodities, hut dollar consideration and the high pricesprevailing make it undesirable to buy in the American market.Supplies of raisins could probably he replaced bythe Southern Dominions, but nuts (hazels and almonds),  althoughthe quantities involved are not large,  could not easily beprocured elsewhere;.Apricot Pulp.      We have already contracted for 10,000 tons ofthe current crop,  and provided tin plate for packing.      serious difficulties would he caused if this contract were notimplemented.      Spanish apricot pulp is superior in quality toany other,  and essential for the production of high qualityApricot Jam.      The price is very reasonable,  and considerably below that which would be asked in other markets.      In anycase,  there are no suitable alternative sources of supply.      Weare already taking the maximum which South Africa can provide,and either quality or currency considerations rule outconsideration of other sources.      Should supplies of ApricotPulp fail,  the yam manufacturers would have to fall back on anattempt to increase Plum and Apple jams.Of the other commodities included in our programmeof purchases from Spain,  some,  for instance,  sardines, mightbe replaced from other sources with varying degrees of difficulty,  and others, notably sherry,  though irreplaceable,might be sacrificed.
FOOD PRODUCTIOHpotash and Pyrites are vital ingredients of ourfertiliser programme and the diminution of supplies which Wouldresult from any rupture of trade relations with Spain would helittle short of disastrous at this juncture, when every nerveis being strained to increase fertiliser production in theinterests of the food supply.PotashFor the present fertiliser season ending30th June,  1947,  Spain,  the cheapest source,  will supply alittle less than 50 per cent,  of total United Kingdom&quot;requirements,  as against the &apos;i/3rds of the total which, shesupplied for    the year ending 30th June, 19h60      Even with theSpanish supplies for the current year,  there will be a short-fall of at least 33 /3rd per cent, on the Ministry ofAgriculture&apos;s target programme for the season.      The decreasein the percentage of our supplies we are obtaining from Spainfor the next fertiliser season may be partially offset by some increase in French production, but this,  like German production,is still far below pre-war level;    there is in effect noreliable alternative source of supply for the United Kingdom.PyritesThe United Kingdom is almost wholly dependent onforeign supplies;    these all come from Spain.      There is noother sure source of supply and if Spanish supplies were cutoff we should have to switch over to U.S.A.  sulphur involving-dollar expenditure.      This would involve basic  alteration of plant taking six to twelve months so that production of sulphate of ammonia and superphosphates (mostly for fertilisers) would inevitably be curtailed..OTHER RAW MATERIALSIron OreIhe United Kingdom is,  if anything, more dependenton Spanish supplies than a year ago.-    Since then shipments from Northern Spain have been possible and out of a total-programme of imports amounting to 7 million tons, between 1-g-and 1-% million tons of ore are coming from Spain.      Spanish oreis of low phosphoric content.      Ores of a comparable.grade areonly obtainable in small quantities from French North africa and Sweden;    we are already obtaining all we can from thesesources, but are running into considerable difficulties with france over price.      Less desirable ore,  demanding more fuel in treatment (about 32 cwt.  of coal per ton of pig Iron), mightbe obtained from Sweden,  although it is doubtful whether port facilities there would allow shipment of an additional 1. /hmillion tons and of course, from a currency point of view,Sweden is a highly undesirable source.      The broad conclusion is that British, steel production would be reduced and requirements of coal increased - and this at a time when weface an acute shortage of steel supplies and coal, thus alltrade,  housing and industry (e.g.,engineering, motors, textiles,machinery) would be hit.
RosinThere is a world shortage oncl sources of supply-other than Spain are already being drawn upon to the full.United Kingdom supplies are about 30 per cent, below needs.The loss of imports from Spain would considerably aggravateour position.&apos;     Rosin is used in a v/ide variety of products,e,g.  soap,  paper,  paint,  linoleum,  footwear,  textiles,  etc.,and the quantity and quality of output of these productswould be adversely affected by a further reduction in rosinsupplies.CorkIncludes specialities which have a high value andare in great demand (e.g. for food bottling, etc.).      Wot allare exclusive to Spain.,      Some cork manufactures could beobtained, from Portugal but not in sufficient quantities to compensate for loss of Spanish supplies and only&apos;at the expenseof dollars.    The only other sources would require dollars..FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONSFor the twelve months ending&apos; December,  1947, thevalue of United Kingdom purchases in Spain will probably benot less than  20 million sterling,  of which the Ministry ofFood programme represents about  lli million and the RawMaterials programme-represents about  6 million.      Possibleadditional purchases later on of fruit,  etc.,  to ease ourausterity diet may raise the total as high as  24 million.Spain has no difficulty in disposing of her surpluses,which are readily bought by other Western European Countries(notably Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and holland) besides ourselves.      It is of course in our interest that Spain should continue to contribute in this way to theeconomic recovery of Western Europe.      The United States,Argentine and Brazil are also heavy buyers in the Spanishmarket,  and their purchases are increasing.Apart from the repercu.ssJ.ons on the food situationhere and the loss of essential raw materials,  rupture oftrade relations with Spain would mean that valuable financialand commercial advantages would be lost to us.      Spain is    ineffect now granting us  h/g- million credit,  a measure ofconsiderable help to us in our present difficulties overforeign exchange,    it is hoped that it may be possible toraise Spanish holdings of sterling up to  10 mi11ion*      At thesame time,  Spain spends her. sterling earnings very readilyin purchasing goods from the sterling area and,  in consultationwith us,  in non-sterling area countries which are short of sterling,  thus enabling the latter to pay for exports from theUnited Kingdom.Since 1940, Spain has been setting aside a proportion of her sterling earnings to meet outstandingcommercial and financial debts to the United Kingdom.      Apartfrom repaying us the credit of about  44 millions granted toher in 1940,  she has paid off the whole of her pre-war-is,-
commercial debts amounting to about  8 millions,  and isat present earmarking 10 per eent.  of the value of her exports to this country for the purpose of clearing offthe arrears of financial debts.      British claims  (capitalitems and others) still amount to about  8-g- millionssterling.      Any break in the continuity of transfer of outstanding debts will militate greatly against the eventual settlement of these claims.
