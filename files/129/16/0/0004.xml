DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS HRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)IS E G R&apos; E TCP. (47) 4 COPY NO,4TH JANUARY,  1947CABINETEAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUTS scheme memorandum by the Minister of food.      On the 31st October the Cabinet authorised the initiation of a scheme for the production of groundnuts onthe lines indicated in CP. (46) 4-02, up to a total cost of 3 millions.    This authority was given on the understandingthat it would not involve interference with other schemes already approved, such as the working of open-cast coal, for.which the same type of special equipment is in- some instancesrequired.2.     Work on the scheme has been, pressed forward and, althoughdifficulties are being and will be encountered, the prospects for clearing 150,000 acres of bush in Tanganyika in time forplanting in 1947 are not unfavourable.    The next step will beto plant, in the autumn of 1947 the whole of the area whichwill then have been cleared.    We are already actively engagedin the attempt to obtain sufficient quantities of thenecessary agricultural equipment.    Again the prospects of doing so are proving better than I anticipated.    But evenif it proved impossible to plant the whole area which willhave been cleared in 1947, the development in that year willprovide, as well as some crop, invaluable experience for subsequent operations.3-      Coneurrently with planning initial operations theSpecial Section which I set up in my Department has carriedout a detailed examination of the long term plan recommendedby the Groundnut Mission.    After obtaining the advice of theLocal Governments and of leading authorities in the UnitedKingdom and overseas who have first hand experience of thekind of problems involved, the Special Section have reportedthat the scheme is a practicable plan for alleviating the  -?/orld shortage of oils and fats which is likely to last formany years;  that it is agriculturally sound;  and that subject to reasonable assumptions no unjustifiable financial risks Tifould be involved.    They considered that labour difficulties could be overcome provided that the rightmethods of recruitment were adopted and suitable employmentconditions were offered, and that the scheme would be ofgreat service to the East African Governments by reason ofthe long term social benefits which would accrue to nativelabour from the clearing of tsetse infected bush, at presentvirtually uninhabitable, and the establishment in its placeof a prosperous industry conducted on the most up-to-datelines.
[j.. I have considered the Special Section&apos;s Report andaccept these conclusions.      I recommend, therefore, that theauthority given by the Cabinet in October should be extendedto cover development of approximately 3 million acres In Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia and Kenya during the next six years.5. On the basis of the revised estimates put forward bythe Special Section the decision to proceed with the schemefor long term development of 3 million acres would call for larger cash advances than those estimated by the GroundnutMission and set out in para,  k of C.P.(U6) h02.      Theincrease in estimated total net cash requirements is mainlya paper increase, however, since it is in part due to thefact that provision has been made for taxation, therebyreducing the amount of net profits available for reimburse-ment of advances, and for interest at per annum on out-standing advances.      Most of the rest of the increase isalso an accountancy matter since it is due to the differenttreatment followed by the Special Section in framing the revised estimates, who have adopted a crop year ending31st August in place of the calandar year used in theGroundnut Mission&apos;s Report, and have assumed that the cashproceeds of sales of a crop harvested in one year will notbe received until after 31st August and will not therefore beavailable for reducing the net  cash advances outstanding at31st August.6. A revised table is set out&apos; below indicating thatmaximum net cash requirements are not likely to exceed 23 millions apart from the special provision for railway,road and harbour construction, with which I deal in para. 7.Owing to rephasing of the development plans this table isnot in any case strictly comparable with that in para.

After the crop year 1949/50 the estimated receipts will exceed the annual expenditure on capital development plusrunning costs.      Re-payment to the Treasury will begin andthe amount outstanding will be reduced until it is finallypaid off in 1964. 97. In addition, it is considered that approximately&apos; 2-g- millions would be required to finance railway, road and harbour works for which no provision was made in theGroundnut Mission&apos;s Report,  since it was assumed that this expenditure would he met by the Local Governments.      Onenquiry, however,  it has been ascertained that they willnot be able to assume this liability themselves andconsequently His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to provideextra capital for such constructional work as may prove necessary.      The provision for rail freight, bagging andhandling included in the estimates is considered sufficientto cover amortisation and service on any such specialadvances,  provided that crops are produced on the. scaleforeseen in para,  8(a) below.8. In framing their revised estimates the SpecialSection accepted the basic assumptions made in thepreparation of the Groundnut Mission1s Report,  subject tothe following modifications(a) It was considered prudent to relate the revised estimates to an average yield 750 lbs.per acre in place of 850 lbs., the minimumaverage yield considered reasonable by theGr oundnut Mission.(b) In order to cover contingencies and having inmind that no cost figures were availablederived -from, development under similar conditions elsewhere, it was consideredadvisable to increase the provision forclearing equipment, unit installations and&apos;central administration and researchinstallations from  19,228,675 to     20,000,000.(c) For similar reasons the Groundnut Mission&apos;sprovision for the annual cost of agriculturaloperations per unit   (&quot;50,000 acres) was increased from  55,1 60 to  60,000.(d) It was assumed that the fair market prices ofgroundnuts will not fall below  30 per ton.o.b.  East African port during the first four crop years and thereafter will not fall below  20 per ton.I have referred already to the provision for taxation and interest taken into account in the revised estimates butnot Included by the Groundnut Mission when calculating thecost at which an undertaking might produce groundnutsoperated under the direct control of a Department of HisMajesty&apos;s Government,9. The revised estimates indicate that:(a) Total net cash requirements are unlikely to exceed  25a millions.      I have dealt fully with this aspect of the estimates in paras.5 - 7 above.(b) The total average cost per ton of shelledgroundnuts f.p.b.  an East African port would lie of the order of  17,18,0 at the time ofthe maximum indebtedness to the Treasury,
V   28reducing thereafter as interest chargesdecrease.      On the basis of yields 850 lbs.and 1120 lbs.  per acre comparable figures wouldbe approximately  16.0.0 per ton and  14.5.6.respectively.      Even the least favourable ofthese estimates compares most advantageouslywith, current prices and the estimated futureprice levels,(c)The cumulative net profits of the undertakingfor the 25 years ending 31st August, 1971 ,would be of the&apos;order of  17 millions after taking into account payments in respect oftaxation (United Kingdom and East African.)approximately  21i millions and interest inexcess of  3 millions.(d)Indebtedness to the Treasury in respect of advances would be re-paid in full by about1964.      Tbis date would,, of course, be influenced by alterations in the rates of taxation and itis not possible to predict yearly rates of income Tax over the next 25 years.      In computingthe total figure set out in section (c)  abovethe Special Section assumed that the current rate of Income Tax would not be maintainedunchanged over the full period.      If, therefore,the current rate is maintained the figure to whichI refer would prove too low.      Nevertheless, fullrepayment of advances would be made well withinthe 25 year period covered by the initial leases.10.        The above, estimates would require only smallamendment even if agricultural equipment cannot be obtained in time to plant the whole area which, may be cleared in1947? provided that full requirements for this equipmentcan be met in time for planting and harvesting the 1948crop.      On the basis 750 lbs.  per acre the total 1947crop will amount to approximately 50,000 tone as comparedwith the estimated crop of approximately 500,000 tons perannum..-after development has been completed.      It is clear,therefore, that the estimates of profits, taxation interestand date of final re-payment would be very little affected.It is considered that the estimate of total net cash-requirements would not require amendment-in view of thefact that I have rounded up the Special Section&apos;s estimate 22,684,000 to  23.000,000, thereby providing sufficientcover (see para.  6).11.        While the areas selected by the Mission for develop-ment appear to have been well chosen, and the recommendation that the work should start  in Tanganyika is sound, Iconsider it  important that the decision to proceed with thefull scheme should be announced in such. a. way as not to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government  (or the Corporation referredto below)  either to develop these particular areas or tofollow the order of development recommended, by- the Missionif experience gained in the initial operations shows that other localities or a different order of development wouldgive better results.12.        Farther consideration of the question of managementhas confirmed the view -put forward provisionally in.CP. (46)  402 that the most  suitable and efficientorganisation for the management of an undertaking of thiskind is a Government owned and. financed Corporation,created by a Statute which should define its responsibilities and powers clearly but leave it as much freedom as possibleIn the choice of the means whereby it achieves its objectives.
I therefore propose that a short and not very controversial Bill should be introduced as soon as possibleto establish a public Corporation,      I realise that thiswill not be possible in this session.      But it will benecessary to introduce the Bill early next session - atleast before the end. of 19h7 - if the new. corporation is to be set up in time to take over from the U.A.C,  by august, 19k8.      The I.I..A. 0.  is unwilling to continue itsManaging Agency after that date.      I also recommend that pending the establishment of such a Corporation, and until such time as the Corporation is ready to assume responsibility for the scheme the United Africa company should act as Managing Agents for His Majesty&apos;s Government.Negotiations with the Company in respect of the Agency forthe initial operations already authorised are proceeding satisfactorily, and I do not anticipate any difficultyin reaching agreement.13..        To satisfy the requests for more information whichhave already been made in Parliament and outside i suggest that an account of the scheme should be published-as soon as possible in the form of a White Paper, theterms of which I would propose to agree with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and Secretary of State for the Colonies.1i.i..        I ask for the agreement of the Cabinet to therecommendations contained in Paragraphs h, 11, 12    and13 above.J. S.Ministry of Pood, S,WJ,ktu January-, 19U7.
