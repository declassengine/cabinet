(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.    &quot;    /-    215CABINETECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1947Proposed. Postponement of the Raising ofthe School Leaving AgeMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of education. The advantages which the Ministerial Committee(CP. (4?) 25) seek to secure by postponing the date for raising the age from April to September,  1947,  are,   in my view,  largely illusory.      They are certainly not worth theodium and disillusionment that would be entailed.      I note that it is admitted that &quot;Neither the economic nor the educational argument can be pushed too far&quot;.The_&quot;educational1  argument for pos tponement2. /The argument that educationally September is better than April because it begins  the educational year.does not bear examination.      It is and will continue to bethe general practice for children to leave at the end ofany term in which they attain the leaving age.3. Nor can I accept the argument  in paragraph 24 ofC.P.(47) 25 that the preparations in the schools will bemuch nearer completion if the date is postponed.4. As regards buildings,  postponement of the date from april to September would only mean a gain of at best threemonths,  since November and December are bad building months.But in fact the Minister of Works, who is doing the major part of the building on behalf of my department,  has assuredrne that there is every prospect that his phased programme ofhut building will be completed on time.5. The balance of the extra age group (14%) will be accomodated in new light construction schools.      special measures have been taken to expedite the erection of these schools.      To postpone the date for raising the age,  so farfrom increasing the likelihood of their being ready in time,would actually lessen it through the removal of the immediatestimulus and the consequent relaxation of their presentefforts by Local Education Authorities.6. As regards teachers,  the whole of the additional13,000 will not be required until the raising of the agebecomes fully effective four terms after the appointed date,and the necessary steps have already been taken to obtainthem term by term up to September, 1948.      They will besecured from teachers already appointed and from studentsnow in or about to enter training, who will not in any case be available for other employment from April to September,1947.SECRETCP. (47) 2914TH JANUARY,   1947
The economic argument7. The maximum possible gain to the man-power position in England and Wales would be the services for a year from July,  1947,  of 150,000 children offourteen,  if they all went into employment.8. Statistics of the fourteen and fifteen yearolds entering various industry groups in the year1945-46 indicate that of the 150,000 a bare 1% wouldhe likely to enter coal-mining, roughly the same numberas would enter sports and entertainments.      2% would go into transport, 3.5% hotels,  laundries, and personal services,  4% agriculture,  and 7.5% the various public services and commerce,  of whom all but about 1,000 inthe public utility services would be engaged onwholly unproductive work.       7% would go into buildingindustries but the labour force for these industries is to be reduced any way and by retaining April 1stas the date for the raising of the age a cut of 10,500would be effected automatically.      As many as 24$ &quot;would enter the distributive trades,  largely in &quot;blind-alley&quot;occupations.9. The remaining 50% (36,750 boys and 38,250girls) might he expected to go into various manufacturing industries.      The contribution of these young children to production would be a negligible factor towardsfilling the labour gap.      It is well-known how much oftheir time is wasted.10. On the other hand,   the 150,000 additionalwage earners would significantly increase consumerdemand, particularly in those sections of the economywhere it is desirable to restrict inflationary demand(Economic Survey,  paragraph 27).Educational and social arguments against postponement11. I need not repeat the educational reasons for raising the age,  for it has not been suggested thatthere should be any but a short postponement.      but even a short postponement would he particularly unfortunate at the present time since it would depriveof a whole year of education .150,000 children,  thevery children who have had their education seriouslyinterrupted by the war.      Because of the time factornone of them will have the opportunity of benefitingfrom the compulsory part-time education up to 18 in county Colleges which will be established under the1944 Act.12. All of the children concerned are working class children.      The children of upper-class parentswill not be affected and will continue at school,particularly at the Grammar schools.13. Educational reform has always been in the forefront of the Party&apos;s social&apos;programme and,  coming,so soon after the reaffirmation in the King&apos;s speech of the Government&apos;s intention to raise the age inApril,  even a limited postponement of the firsteffective step to implement the 1944 Act would inevitably call in quest ion the Governments intentionswith regard to social reform.
14. Even more unfortunate would &quot;be the effect on educational and progressive opinion in general,  consciousas it is of the fate of the Fisher Act of 1918.      the raising of the age at a date not later than that providedfor in the Act is commonly regarded as a test of theGovernment&apos;s sincerity,15. Under other Governments education has too often been the first casualty of an economic blizzard.      a labour Government should he the last  to seek protection -and very meagre protection at that - from a fallibleforecast of economic trouble by the enlistment of childlabour.      The price to be paid would be not only the sacrifice of the social and educational interests of thechildren concerned but the grave impairment of theprospects of maintaining and gaining the necessary publicenthusiasm and support for educational reform as a whole.Conclusion16. For all these reasons,  therefore, I submit thatthe date for the raising of the school leaving age should remain unaltered.Ministry of Education, S.W.1.14th January,  1947.
