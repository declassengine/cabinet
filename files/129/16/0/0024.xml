/Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1947SECRETCopy No.CP. (47) 2410 A January, 1947ca:BINTMALTA constitution memorandum by the Chairman of the Colonial Affairs CommitteeI circulate the draft of a White Paper about the Malta Constitution. TheSecretary of State for the Colonies is anxious to present this before the debate on the Malta (Reconstruction) Bill in the House of Commons on 24th January,1947. The draft was considered by the/ Colonial Affairs Committee on 7th January and agreed to subject to a few alterations which have been made.2. The Cabinet will remember that a promise was given in 1943 that, afterthe war, responsible government would be restored in Malta within the samesphere as between 1921 and 1933. This promise was warmly welcomed in theColony, and during the past two years an unofficial National Assembly has metregularly to consider the form which the new Constitution should take. Lastspring the then Secretary of State appointed Sir Harold MacMichael asConstitutional Commissioner to visit the Colony for discussions with the national assembly and other representatives of local opinion and to submit detailed pro-posals. The intention is that his report should be published simultaneously withthe White Paper : copies of this report are also circulated for the information ofthe Cabinet.3. The results of the discussions between the Constitutional commissioner and the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly encourage the hopethat there is a reasonable prospect of securing general acceptance in Malta for thepresent proposals. No substantial departure from Sir Harold MacMichaeTsrecommendations is proposed. In substance the intention is to restore responsible government in a form which differs in only minor respects from that enjoyed by the maltese between 1921 and 1933 : a brief description of the salient features of this constitution is contained in paragraph 6 of the draft White Paper.4. We recommend that the issue of a White Paper in the terms of theattached draft should be approved.(Intld.)A.

MALTASTATEMENT OF POLICY ON CONSTITUTIONAL. REFORM  -The present constitution of Malta, which is of the ordinary Crown Colonytype, was established in 1939 by Letters Patent supplemented by Royal Instruc-tion.   These provided for:  &apos; &apos;    &apos;     -(a) an Executive Council of five ex-officio members (in addition; to theGovernor) and such other persons (nominated members), as the. Governormay from time to time appoint with the approval of the Secretary of State;(b) a Council of Government of twenty members eight, of whom areofficials, ten elected on the basis of adult male suffrage, and two unofficialsnominated by the Governor.2. In 1942 and again in 1943 the elected members of the Council of Goverai-ment represented that the time was ripe for His Majesty&apos;s Government tomake a declaration outlining their policy for future constitutional reform,On the 7th July, 1943, the following announcement was made in the Houseof Commons by the Secretary of State for the Colonies: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration certain repfe-sentations which have been made by the elected members of the Councilof Government in Malta, who have asked for an announcement regarding their intentions in relation to further constitutional development. Sincethe present Constitution of Malta was inaugurated in 1939 .the fortress hassuccessfully withstood a siege of two and a half years. During the siegethe Island was subjected to heavy and sustained attacks from the air and toa food shortage of increasing gravity. By their steadfastness and fortitudeunder the severe hardships thus occasioned, the people of Malta, togetherwith its gallant garrison, rendered services of incalculable value to the allied cause. His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with particular satisfaction that throughout the whole of this period &quot;the Council of Government con-tinued to discharge its normal functions in relation to legislation and thediscussion of public affairs.For more than ten years, between 1921 and 1933, the people of Maltaenjoyed full legislative and administrative responsibility under the Crownin the conduct of their national affairs, the control of naval and military services and of all matters appertaining to - the position of Malta as an imperial fortress, or otherwise affecting imperial interests or policy, being reserved to the Imperial Government. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that responsible government in the same sphere should again be granted to Malta after the war.It will not be possible while the war continues for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to undertake a detailed examination of the various constitutional,financial and administrative questions which must be resolved beforeresponsible government can be introduced, nor can some of these questions,in particular those which arise in connection with finance, be defined untilthe Malta Government are able to visualise more clearly the extent and thecost of the.plans for reconstruction and it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as soon as hostilities are brought to an end, that these matters should be pursued without delay, and that steps should be taken to consultresponsible opinion in Malta with a view to giving expression as far as-possible to the wishes of the Maltese people regarding the form which thenew Constitution might take.&quot;55360 ! A2
3. On the 15th July, 1943, the following motion was passed in the Councilof Government with the support of all&apos;the elected members (i.e., six Constitutional members, three Nationalist members and one Labour member)&apos;-IThat this Council welcomes (the announcement made by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies in the House of Commons and by His excellency the Governor in this Council on the 7th July, 1943, which promises fulllegislative and administrative responsibility under the Crown to the peopleof, Malta in the conduct of their internal affairs after the war.   And thatthe thanks of this Council, in the name of the people of these Islands be forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Government at Westminster.&quot;4. The Elected Members of the Council of Government then proceeded to convene a National Congress representative of all constituted bodies reco^-nised by Government. As a result of its deliberations, a National assembly which well reflected all aspects of Maltese opinion, was convoked in orderthat expression might be given to the wishes of the people of Malta regardingthe form which the new constitution might take. The Assembly met at regular intervals during 1945 and 1946, and their conclusions as embodied in a tentative draft instrument, proved of the greatest value in clarifying thepoints requiring, consideration and in interpreting to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment local opinion on the various issues involved.5. In January, 1946, a Constitutional Commissioner (Sir HaroldMacMichael, G.C.M.G., D.S.O.) was appointed by the Secretary of state with the following terms of reference:  &quot; To visit Malta in order to formulate detailed proposals, after consulta-tion with representatives of the Maltese people, on the most appropriate means of implementing the declaration regarding constitutional reformmade by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House ofCommons on the 7th July, 1943; and to discuss generally any matters,including questions of finance, that have a bearing on the restoration of responsible government.&apos;&apos;The Commissioner reached Malta in May and completed his discussions inSeptember. He had full and&apos;cordial consultations with the accredited repre-.sentatives of the National Assembly, and in addition had every opportunityfor acquainting himself with all aspects of opinion in the Island. His report is published simultaneously with this White Paper as Colonial No. 207.6. The announcement quoted in paragraph 2 above made it clear that theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government was that responsible governmentshould be restored within the same sphere as between 1921 and 1933- SirHarold MacMichaePs recommendations, like the National Assem!bly&apos;s pro-]posals which formed the basis of his discussions in Malta, are formulated,on the assumption that the general structure of the new constitution will bejsimilar to that established by the Letters Patent of 14th April, 1921. The;following passage from the Report of the Royal Commission of 1931 (Gmd!3993) summarises the main features of the Constitution of 1921: &quot; The salient feature of the Constitution of 1921 was that it was basedjupon the dyarchical principle. The object was to give the Maltese people,real and complete responsibility for the conduct, both by legislation anaby administration, of their own&quot; local affairs. There was, however, an areaof matters arising out of the position of Malta as a strategical centre oilvital importance, which were of Imperial concern. These matters were!to be reserved to the Imperial Government in as complete a manner 311local interests were to be handed over to the Maltese Legislature anilExecutive.    Two distinct Governments were set up in the Island, eaclifi
clothed with legislative and executive power within its defined sphere.The &apos; Maltese Government &apos; was responsible to a Legislature, con-sisting of an Assembly and Senate, constituted on&apos; a representative basis,while the &apos; Maltese Imperial Government-&apos;, which worked both legislativelyand executively within the area of &apos; reserved matters &apos;, was vested in a governor, who was subject to the instructions of Your Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.The method by which the differentiation of responsibility was achieved in the framing of the Constitution was that of granting to the Maltesegeneral powers of responsible self-government for all purposes, subject tocertain reservations set out in Section 41 (1) of the Constitution letters patent. These Letters Patent were accompanied by concurrent letters patent constituting the office of Governor, and under Clause 12 of thelatter the Governor was empowered to make by Ordinance laws withregard to the matters reserved from the local Legislature. The mattersreserved to the Imperial authorities were described in general terms inSection 41 (1) of the Letters Patent as matters touching the public safety and defence of the Empire and the general interests of Your Majesty&apos;ssubjects not resident in Malta. Without prejudice to this general reservationcertain subjects were particularly specified as &quot; reserved matters &quot;. Theserelated to matters of defence or to matters in which the foreign relations of the Empire or trade and communications between its component partswere concerned.&quot;7. The discussions which Sir Harold MacMichael had in Malta were mainly concerned, therefore, with the examination of proposals put forward by theNational Assembly for modification of the Constitution of 1921, as subse-quently amended. His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered SirHarold MacMichael&apos;s recommendations and find them generally acceptable.It is not proposed to recapitulate these recommendations in full in this state-ment, as many are of minor or technical interest. They feel it desirable,however, in the following paragraphs,&quot; first to invite special attention to themore important of the recommendations which are acceptable to them, and secondly to discuss certain proposals made by the Commissioner to which itis not possible to give effect as they stand and other points raised in theReport.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given special consideration to Chapter of Sir Harold MacMichaeTs report which deals with the method of grantingthe Constitution and the reservation of power to revoke, alter and amendits provisions.-r.-r-.&apos;.snaMethod of granting the constitution the National Assembly expressed a strong desire that the constitution should be granted by Act of Parliament rather than by a Prerogative Instru-ment. A similar request was made by the National Assembly of 1919 beforethe 1921 Constitution was granted. The proposal on this occasion, as in 1919,was prompted by a wish to achieve the greatest possible degree of certaintyand stability. While sympathising with this wish, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment must regard as decisive the arguments against the proposal set outin Sir Harold MaoMichael&apos;s report and they feel bound to emphasise that only one Colonial constitution (that of the Leeward Islands) is established&apos;by Act of Parliament; in that exceptional case resort to Parliament wasnecessary on legal grounds. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore,decided that, as in 1921, the Constitution should be granted by letters patent.
Revocation of the ConstitutionSir Harold MacMiehael recommends and His Majesty&apos;s Government agreethat this Constitution, having been granted by Letters Patent, should be revoked, only by Act of Parliament. No power will, therefore, be reservedin the Letters Patent to revoke the Constitution by Prerogative Instrumentthis will re-establish the position as it was between 1921 and 1936 when an Act of Parliament (the Malta (Letters Patent) Act, 1936) was necessaryto restore to the Crown the power to revoke by Letters Patent of whichit had divested itself in enacting the Constitution of 1921.Amendment of the constitution the question of amending the Constitution falls to be considered under two heads:(a) As in the Constitution of 1921, certain sections of the new Constitu-tioh, namely those relating to the Reserved Matters and the Special Subjects(Religious Toleration, Language, Judges and the Reserved Civil List) willnot be subject to repeal or amendment by the Maltese Legislature. Powerto revoke, alter or amend these sections by Prerogative Instrument will,however, be reserved in the Letters Patent.(b) As regards the remaining provisions of the Constitution, power to repeal or amend these, similar to that contained in the Constitution of 1921,will be granted to the Maltese Legislature.   These provisions will not-be subject to repeal or amendment by Prerogative Instrument since no: power for that purpose will be reserved in the Letters Patent.Security of the Fortress9. It will be noted that the safeguards contained in the Constitution of 1921for ensuring the security of Malta as a fortress will, under the recommendationsOf Sir Harold MadMichael, be fully reproduced in the new Constitution. Onthis question no differences of view emerged during the negotiations: therepresentatives of the National Assembly accepted without question thenecessity for the reservation to the Governor of the necessary powers. SitHarold MacMichael draws attention, however, to the fact that the Constitutionof 1921 was defective in that it contained no provision under which HisMajesty&apos;s Government could take prompt and speedy action in the event oia public emergency. Sir Harold MacMichael suggests that, on this occasion,a section should be inserted in the Constitution, similar to Section 3o(i)(a)of the Ceylon Constitution of 1946, under which the Crown can make sucllaws as appear necessary for securing and maintaining public safety and order and supplies and services in case of public emergency. His Majesty&apos;!Government recognise the important arguments in favour of reserving powers for meeting an emergency, and for their part they welcome this proposal.They realise, however, that no such provision was included in the 1921 Con-stitution and that insistence on its acceptance might, therefore, be held tobe inconsistent with the promise made in 1943. In these circumstances theydo not propose to press for the inclusion of the suggested section,if it fails to commend itself to Maltese opinion. In that event, however,it would be necessary for the section in the new Constitution corresponding:to Section 68 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 to make ilclear that the power to amend the provisions relating to reserved mattersenables an amendment to be made on the lines of that declared valid bySection 5 of the Malta Constitution Act, 1932; that is to say, the sectioncorresponding to Section &apos;68 would expressly reserve power to amend thosprovisions, whether by way of addition, variation or substitution, so as &apos;
-   1* &apos; - - -jnable full and exclusive legislative authority to be exercised by the Governorif the Secretary of State were satisfied that a grave emergency existed andthat it endangered the safety, peace, order or good government of the islandor prejudiced the carrying on of responsible government.Second Chamberio. Opinion in Malta has shown itself divided over the question of theestablishment on this occasion of a Second Chamber. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment feel that this is a question on which the Maltese themselves must make the final decision, and they have no wish to express an opinion on its merits. But they share Sit Harold MacMichael&apos;s view that if there is to bei Second Chamber it should be equipped, by virtue of its composition and powers, to serve a useful purpose. The Second Chamber proposed by theNational Assembly clearly falls far short of this criterion, and in these circum-stances His Majesty&apos;s Government have no hesitation in accepting Sir Harold)lacMichael&apos;s recommendation that no provision for a Second Chamber should be made in the Constitution. Special provision will, however, be made in the letters Patent to enable the Maltese to establish a Second Chamber, if atsome future date they should wish to do so.Franchiseii. It will be noted with interest that the National Assembly have recom-mended the extension of the suffrage to women. The Constitution will leavethe question of suffrage to be dealt with by law of the Maltese Legislature,but His Majesty&apos;s Government take this opportunity of expressing their approval of this recommendation.Judges12. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept Sir Harold MaoMichael&apos;s recom-mendation that &quot; Judges &quot; should be removed from the Reserved matters and included among the Special Subjects, the provisions for which can be amended by His Majesty but not by the Maltese Legislature (ReligiousToleration, Language, the Reserved Civil List). The position in the newConstitution will, therefore, be that (a) the judges will be appointed by the Governor in Council;(b) no person will be qualified to be appointed a judge unless, during aperiod of not less than 12 years, or during periods amounting in theaggregate to not less than 12 years, he has either practised at the Bar orserved as a magistrate in Malta, or has partly so practised and partly soserved;     1(c) the remuneration of judges will be as set out in the Reserved civil list and may not be diminished during tenure of office;(d) a judge will vacate his office on his attaining the age of 65 years;(e) a judge may be removed from his office only by the Governor inCouncil on an address from the Legislative Assembly praying for suchremoval on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity, except thatjudges holding office at the time of coming into force of the new Con-stitution, whose commissions will continue as heretofore, may, as at present,be removed from office only by the Governor.Police13. It is also proposed that &quot; Police &quot; should be removed from the reserved Matters.
Reservation of Bills14. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept Sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s recorj.mendation regarding the reservation of Bills by the Governor for the signify,tion of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, including the recommendation that no fixejperiod should be laid down for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasureThe effect of this will be that, while the Governor may reserve any bill, \will be required, in the Constitution to reserve the following classes of bill;.(a) bills discriminating against non-Maltese;(fr) bills which, while not affecting a reserved matter as such, encroachon it to a limited extent;(c) bills relating to any of the &quot; Special &quot; matters (see Chapter 8);(d) bills repealing or amending those provisions of the constitution which the Maltese Legislature may repeal or amend, or repugnant to otinconsistent with any provisions of the Constitution.15. As stated above, there are certain recommendations in Sir HaroldMacMichael&apos;s report to&apos;which it is not possible to give effect as they stand.The report also raises other questions requiring consideration. His Majesty&apos;!Government&apos;s decisions on these recommendations and questions are set out below (the references being to the Chapters of the report):CHAPTER 6-LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLYQuorum of the Legislative AssemblyHis Majesty&apos;s Government consider that a quorum of 21 is too large andhave decided that the quorum shall be 15.Eligibility of Civilian Employees of Service Departments for membership of the  Legislative AssemblyHis Majesty&apos;s Government are considering whether any relaxation is possiblein the rules governing the eligibility of civilian employees of the service departments in Malta for membership of the local Legislature.CHAPTER 7 RESERVED MATTERSA.   general power of the maltese legislature to make lawsSir Harold MacMichaeFs suggestion that the wording of the section dealingwith this matter should be modified so as to remove the possibility oiambiguity will be borne in mind in connection with the drafting of the neiConstitution. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept his further recommendation that the Secretary of State&apos;s decision shall be final on the question whetheia law passed or power exercised by the Maltese Government affects or relate:to any Reserved Matter, on the understanding that the words &quot; a law passed... by the Maltese Government &quot; refer only to a Bill which has not yebeen assented to. They do not consider, however, that it would be appro-priate for the Secretary of State to be called upon to pronounce upon tievalidity of a law to.which assent has already been given.B.   particularDefence (Section 41 (1) (fe) of 1921 Constitution)His Majesty&apos;s Government, while accepting the recommendation thatcompulsory acquisition of land and the payment of reasonable compensattherefor should continue to be reserved, but should be dealt with in a separately 
consider that the expression &quot; The Defence of the Island &quot; isnot of itself sufficiently comprehensive and that it is, therefore, necessaryto include a reference to the other naval and military matters referred to inthe 1921 Constitution. As regards Sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s recommendation(iii) in regard to the assessment of compensation, His Majesty&apos;s government accept the principle that the Maltese point of view should be fully repre-sented. It is considered, however, that it would be inappropriate to providefor this in the Constitution Letters Patent and the question of how such provision can most appropriately be made is being considered.LANDS etc.  used or required for naval,  military and other purposesconnected with any reserved matter (section 41 (l) (/) of1921 constitution)Palaces, etc. (Section 41 (1) (g) of 1921 Constitution)His Majesty&apos;s Government realise that both these provisions of the 1921Constitution need clarification and Sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s recommendationsthereon will be borne in mind when the new Constitution is being drafted.Immigration.    (Section 41   (1)   (ft)   of 1921 Constitution)His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that it is necessary to retain&quot;Immigration &quot; without any qualification among the Reserved Matters, butthey take this opportunity of giving an assurance that they will not use their control of immigration to facilitate the entry into Malta of displaced persons or refugees without the consent of the Maltese Government.Naturalisation and Aliens.    (Section 41  (1)   (Z) of 1921 Constitution)His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered the suggestion thatthe expression &quot; Naturalisation and Aliens &quot; be amplified and clarified, but have come to the conclusion that this is not practicable.Appropriation of revenues derived from Reserved Matters.    (Section 41 (1)(0) of 1921 Constitution)His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the procedure embodied in the1921 Constitution should be retained.PosfaS and Telegraph Censorship.    (Section 41 (1)   (m) of the 1921 Con-stitution)Sir Harold MacMichael recommends that, while this should remain are served Matter, a proviso should be added to ensure that censorship shouldnot be imposed except for reasons of security. It is not proposed to addsuch a proviso or otherwise to alter the wording of the 1921 Constitution,but His Majesty&apos;s Government confirm that censorship is inserted among the reserved Matters solely for reasons of security and that it is not intended that it should be used for any other purpose.CHAPTER 8-SPECIAL MATTERSb.   languageOfficial languages and languages of the LegislatureHis Majesty&apos;s Government accept the recommendation that English andMaltese should be the official languages: They consider, however, that allpublic documents, and all public notices issued by the Government of Malta,:hould be in both languages, that provision should be made on the lines ofSection 49 (1) of the Malta Letters Patent, 1939, and, as regards thejournals, entries, minutes and proceedings of the Legislature, that speechesmade in Maltese should be recorded in both languages.
Language of the CourtsHis Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the existing provisions as to ^language of the Courts contained in section 22 of the Code of Organisafi;1and Civil Procedure (Laws of Malta, Revised Edition 1942, Cap. 15) J section 509 of the Criminal Code (Laws of Malta, Revised Edition im; iCap. 12)&apos; are satisfactory and should be retained.    The Constitution Jprovide that any&quot; bill of the Maltese Legislature which amends, or otherwj!affects the operation of, these sections or makes other provision regardiiithe language of the Courts will be reserved for the signification of 1Majesty&apos;s pleasure.Language of InstructionIt will be necessary to make adequate provision to safeguard the presaposition of the English and Maltese languages.general it will be necessary to ensure that nothing should be done, by way tlegislation or administration, to diminish or detract from the position of ftEnglish and Maltese languages as recognised by the Constitution.CHAPTER io-DISALLOWANCE AND RESERVATION OF LAWSDisallowance of Laws by His MajestyThis power, although rarely used, is normal in Colonial constitutions, ant IHis Majesty&apos;s Government see no reason to depart from this practice in thcase of Malta. His Majesty will, therefore, be empowered by the netConstitution to disallow any law within a period of one year from the dateof the Governor&apos;s assent thereto. The Constitution will also contain a pro Jvision to preserve rights acquired and liabilities incurred under a law whklis subsequently disallowed.CHAPTER ii-MiISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS RELATING TO I. THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNORThe appointment of MinistersHis Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the suggestion that the Governo:should be bound by the advice of the Head of the Ministry in appointing ft*other Ministers, but see no reason to depart from the provisions of the 192!Constitution in this matter. It is, however, proposed that the words &quot; as kthinks fit &quot; should be omitted from the relevant sub-section. Those wortswould appear to suggest that the appointment of Ministers is entirely a mattewithin his own discretion, without reference to the Head of the Ministry,and that is not the intention.CHAPTER 12 RELATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF MALTAWITH HIS MAJESTY \S GOVERNMENTHis Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that it would be appropriate ittransfer responsibility for the affairs of Malta to the Dominions Office.The suggestion put forward by Sir Harold MacMichael for the creation inLondon of a Departmental Joint Committee for Malta is accepted in principle,and the necessary arrangements will be made in due course.
CHAPTER 13 PUBLIC OFFICERSHis Majesty&apos;s Government accept the recommendation that the appointmentof public officers should, as in 1921, be vested in the Govemor-in-Council.It is not proposed to insert in the Constitution a requirement for the appoint-ment of a Public Services Commission, but as general experience has shown the substantial advantages to be gained from the impartial advice of such a body His Majesty&apos;s Government do not doubt that Maltese Ministers willcontinue to avail themselves of a Commission. In that event it is consideredthat, as elsewhere, nominations to the. Commission should be made by theGovernor acting in his discretion.CHAPTER 14-THE IMPERIAL SIDE OF THE DYARCHYThe matters discussed in this chapter are the exclusive concern of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, who wish for the present to reserve their decisionon Sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s recommendations.16. The large measure of agreement reached in the discussions between SirHarold MaoMichael and the representatives of the National Assembly encouragement-ages the hope that a Constitution on the lines indicated above will findacceptance in Malta. In view of the assurance given to the National assembly that a further opportunity for comment would be afforded to them beforethe Constitution was promulgated,. His Majesty&apos;s Government have thoughtit desirable to explain fully in. this statement their intentions regarding theform that the Constitution will take. Adequate time will&apos; be given for the examination of these proposals by the National Assembly, and the necessaryinstruments will then be submitted to His Majesty with the least possible delay.(33360)  Wt. szio 964   116&apos; 1/47   D.L.

PART  INARRATIVECHAPTER 1.Terms of Reference.The terms of reference issued to me on the 2nd May, 1946, by directionof the Secretary of State for the Colonies, were: &quot; To visit Malta in order to formulate detailed proposals after con-sultation with representatives of the Maltese people, on the most appro-priate means of implementing the declaration regarding constitutional reform made by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies in theHouse of Commons on the 7th July, 1943; and to discuss generallyany matters, including questions of finance, that have a bearing onthe restoration of responsible government.&quot;The declaration of the 7th July, 1943, above referred to was as follows*:-&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration certainrepresentations which have been made by the elected members of theCouncil of Government in Malta, who have asked for an announcementregarding their intentions in relation to further constitutional development.Since the present Constitution of Malta was inaugurated in 1939 the fortress has successfully withstood a siege of two and a half years. Duringthe siege the Island was subjected to heavy and sustained attacksfrom the air and to a food shortage of increasing gravity. By theirsteadfastness and fortitude under the severe hardships thus occasioned,the people of Malta, together with its gallant garrison, rendered servicesof incalculable value to the allied cause. His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with particular satisfaction that throughout the whole of thisperiod the Council of Government continued to discharge its normalfunctions in relation to legislation and the discussion of public affairs.&quot; For more than ten years, between 1921 and 1933, the people of Maltaenjoyed full legislative and administrative responsibility under the Crownin the conduct of their national affairs, the control of naval and military services and of all matters appertaining to the position of Malta as an imperial fortress, or otherwise affecting imperial interests or policy, being reserved to the Imperial Government. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that responsible government in the same sphere should again be granted to Malta after the war.&quot; It will not be possible while the war continues for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to undertake a detailed examination of the various con-stitutional, financial and administrative questions which must be resolvedbefore responsible government can be introduced, nor can some of thesequestions, in particular those which arise in connection&apos; with finance, be defined until the Malta Government are able to visualise more clearly the extent and the cost of the plans for reconstruction and it is theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as soon as hostilities are broughtto an end, that these matters should be pursued without delay, and that steps should be taken to consult responsible opinion in Malta with aview to giving expression as far as possible to the wishes of the Maltese people regarding the form which the new Constitution might take.&quot;* See Hansard Volume 390, No. 85, Cols. 2078-9.53242
CHAPTER 2.Resume of Constitutional Developments in Malta to August, 1936.   $fSome synopsis of the course of events in Malta leading up to the declaretion quoted above is&apos;needed for an understanding of the background against which my work was to proceed.As the Malta Royal Commission of 1931 remarks*,&quot; It would be almost possible to plot a graph of the constitutionalhistory of Malta during the last hundred years showing the rise and fall of constitutions modelled alternately on the principle of benevolent auto,democracy and that of representative government.   From time to time some measure of self-government was granted and then, after a period, super-superseded by a strict Crown Colony system.&quot;A demand for self-government is recorded very soon after the incorpora-tion of Malta in the British Empire, and the first of Malta&apos;s Royal Commis-sions reported adversely to the claims made in 1812.    It was twenty-three years later, in 1835, that a Council of Government, nominal heir tothe older Consiglio Popolare, but with legislative powers, was first granted:it included one selected representative of local landowners, one of local mer-chants and one of British-born merchants.   In 1849, on lrie advice of SirRichard 0&apos;Ferrall, the first civilian Governor of the Island, this Council wasreconstituted with ten official members, half of whom were to be Maltese,and eight elected unofficial members.Representative government with a Constitution still embodying the cor-porative system was granted by Letters Patent in 1887 and a Council of Govern-ment set up composed of the Governor and six official and fourteen othermembers, ten of whom were to be elected by the general electors and four by special electors. These latter were representative of the Clergy, the Nobility,the University Graduates and the Chamber of Commerce, respectively. Theobject, in the words of Sir Henry Holland, then Secretary of State, was &quot;togive to the representatives of the people of Malta, for the first time, a specificpower of deciding questions of finance and other questions of local concern,while full power is reserved to the Crown, not only as interested in thesecurity of the fortress, but also as responsible for the obligations of the island Government, to intervene, by legislation or otherwise, in regard toany question. This power has until now been exercised by using the officialmajority, in case of necessity, to outvote the elected members; but I concurwith those who desire that this procedure should be abandoned, and that ifthe Crown should at any time have occasion to act it should do so by adirect exercise of the prerogative.&quot;The Royal Commission of 1931 comments:  &apos;&apos; The scheme was liberal in idea but as a method of government hadserious defects. The legislative and executive control was divided. the elected members were given power without responsibility.&quot;After years of contention, centring largely upon such questions as that ofappointments to Executive Council and, at a later stage, that of the lan-guages to be officially recognised in the Island, the system proved unwoilable, and it was decided in 1903 that the time had come for a reversalto that of 1849.&quot; A new Constitution,&quot; the Report proceeds, &quot; was set up of thesmore strict Crown Colony type, with an official majority in the legis-llative body.   The elected members of the Council of Government were I* Cmd. 3993, 1932.
reduced to eight and the official members were increased to ten.   From1903 onwards the elected members devoted themselves almost entirely to protests against the new form of government.   They largely refrained from taking part in the work of legislation or administration.   They alsoabstained from attendance at the Council of Government except foran occasional appearance to register a protest.   In the Press and on the platform outside they devoted themselves to incessant agitation anddenounced every measure of government in violent terms.&quot;At the close &quot;of the first world war, this state of affairs came to a headin the riots of 1919.   The immediate cause of the trouble was, in the main,economic, but, as usually occurs the unrest was fomented by political agita-tion.   A National Assembly had been convened in February, 1919, and aseries of political demands formulated.    Disturbances of a serious naturebroke out early in June.    On the 10th June, Lord Plumer arrived andassumed the administration.   One of his first steps was to invite the Malteseto provide a reasoned statement of the constitutional changes which they desired.The National Assembly accordingly met in August and submitted a draftproviding for self-government in local affairs. In the event of disagreementconcerning imperial interests between the Governor and his Cabinet, thedecision was left to the discretion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The draft included proposals that the Executive should consist of a civilGovernor and a Cabinet of seven Ministers, together with a Legislature com-posed of two Houses, namely, an elected Chamber of Deputies of twenty-two members and a Senate of twelve, elected from among higher ecclesiastics,graduates, professional men, members of the Chamber of Commerce, ex-members of the Chamber of Deputies and persons enjoying an unearned in-come of over  100 a year, or paying  50 in rent.In September, 1919, Mr. Amery visited the Island as Under-Secretary ofState for the Colonies: the recommendations which he made were accepted and on the 19th November it was announced in the House of commons that:&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the time has cometo entrust the people of Malta with full responsible control of their purely local affairs, the control of the naval and military Services and of such other services and functions of Government as are connected with theposition of Malta as an imperial fortress and harbour remaining vested in the imperial authorities. Some time will necessarily be involved in working out the details of the proposed (Constitution and in clearing up some of the more urgent financial and administrative problemscreated by the War, and I shall at a later date have to come to theHouse for a measure of assistance to the finances of the Island, whichhave been seriously embarrassed by circumstances arising out of thewar and the subsequent reduction of the garrison and dockyard. i hope, however, that it may be possible to dispose of all these matters in the course of the next year and to enable the new system of localself-government to come into force at the beginning of 1921 &quot;.This announcement was received with great enthusiasm in Malta, but twoyears were to elapse before the details of the necessary ConstitutionalInstruments could be completed.Under the dyarchical principle embodied in the Constitution of 1921*control of the Island was divided between the Maltese Government responsible to a Legislature and the Maltese Imperial Government working legislativelyand executively within the area of &quot; reserved matters &quot;.* The relevant Instruments will be found as Appendices i, ii and iii.53242 A 4
The Legislature of the Maltese Government was sub-divided into a SenMand a Legislative Assembly. The former consisted of seventeen member!and the latter of thirty-two members. Their powers, etc., are set out ijSections i to 53 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921. In casjof disagreement between the Senate and the Legislative Assembly, provision was made for a joint sitting of the members of the two Houses as describejin Section 42.Provision was also made under the Constitutional Instruments for thefollowing bodies: 1. The Ministry.The Governor might, as he thought fit, appoint Ministers not exceedimseven in number, one of whom was to be designated as the Head of theMinistry. The offices of these Ministers were to include the headships oicertain departments, and every Minister had to be a member of one of theHouses of the Legislature.2. The Executive Council.This Council, presided over by the Governor, consisted of such personsbeing Ministers, as the Governor might appoint. In the execution of his powers the Governor was to be guided by the advice of the Council inrespect of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Maltese Legislature, butif in any case he saw fit to dissent from the opinion of the ExecutiveCouncil he could act in his own discretion, provided he reported to theSecretary of State his reasons for so doing.3. The Nominated Council.This Council, presided over by the Governor, consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor and the Legal Adviser sitting as ex-officio members, and of oneofficer from each of the three Services. In the execution of his powers inrespect of &quot; reserved matters &quot;, the Governor was required to consult withthe Nominated Council except in cases of great urgency or where the mattersinvolved were of a trivial nature. In particular, the Governor was boundto consult the Nominated Council before exercising his power to makeOrdinances regarding &quot; reserved matters&quot;.4. The Privy Council.The Governor was also given a discretionary power to summon the Execu-five Council and the Nominated Council to sit together for the considerationof matters which were not within the exclusive responsibility of the ExecutiveCouncil.5. The Joint Committee of the Privy Council of Malta.The Governor might also appoint a Joint Committee of the Privy Councilof Malta, consisting of three members of the Executive Council nominated by the Head of the Ministry and three members of the Nominated Councilappointed by himself, to consider any question relating to any legislative or administrative action taken or proposed to be taken by the Maltese Govern-ment which, in his opinion, affected or was likely to affect any &quot; reservedmatter &quot;.The Joint Committee might also be invited to consider any similar question;arising under Section 66 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, 01of questions regarding any Ordinance or Order in Council dealing with&quot; reserved matter &quot; which it was proposed to make. The Governor was required in all cases to consult with the Committee before giving any certificatfor direction under Section 43 with regard to the provisions of any Billaffecting any &quot; reserved matter &quot;.
I&apos; An examination of the minutes of the Nominated Council from its firstfceeting on the 30th November, 1921, to its last recorded meeting on the[76th October, 1935, shows that meetings were held at more or less weeklyI intervals during Field-Marshal Lord Plumer&apos;s period of office and thereafterIless frequently. During these early years, the bulk of the items on the1 agenda consisted of the formal communication to members of correspondence1 dealing, as a general rule but not exclusively, with miscellaneous affairs toncerned with the &apos;&apos; reserved matters &apos;&apos; and matters in which the services  ,vere interested. There are also brief records of the CounciTs consideration ofI draft ordinances, regulations, notices, etc., of similar type and occasionallyI notes of the procedural action to be taken vis-a-vis the Government of Malta.I There are three or four references to meetings of the Joint Committee of theI privy Council.I The full text of the Letters Patent embodying the new Constitution is repro-I duced in Appendix I of this Report.  In the words of the Royal Commission-&quot; The salient feature of the Constitution of 1921 was that it was based upon the dyarchical principle.   The object was to give the MalteseI    people real and complete responsibility for the conduct, both by legisla-tion and by administration, of their own local affairs.    There was,however, an area of matters arising out of the position of Malta as astrategical centre of vital importance, which were of imperial concern.These matters were to be reserved to the Imperial Government in as complete a manner as local interests were to be handed over to the MalteseLegislature and Executive.  Two distinct Governments were set up in the island, each clothed with legislative and executive power within itsdenned sphere.   The &apos; Maltese Government &apos; was responsible to a Legis-lature consisting of an Assembly and Senate, constituted on a representa-tive basis, while the &apos; Maltese Imperial Government &apos;, which worked bothlegislatively and executively within the area of &apos; reserved matters &apos; wasH   vested in a Governor, who was subject to the instructions of YourWk   Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;m The &quot; reserved matters &quot; were originally described in general terms inSection 41 (1) of the Letters Patent of 1921 as &quot; matters touching the public safety and defence of Our Empire and the general interests of Our subjects not: resident in Malta &quot;, but it will be seen that, without prejudice to this generalpreservation, certain subjects were more specifically enumerated.The Royal Commission points out that &quot; in virtue of the general reserva-Ifan mentioned above, any matters other than those particularly specified could be brought within the reserved sphere when the interests of the public safetyI and defence of the Empire became involved &quot;.The Maltese Legislature, consisting of a Senate and a Legislative Assembly,1 was opened by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales amid general rejoicingsfon the 1st November, 1921. Four parties were represented: the UnioneiPolirica, the Constitutional Party, the National Democratic Party and thejLabour Party. In the Legislative Assembly the Unione Politica (14 seats)&quot;la majority with the support of the Labour Party (7 seats) and in theI Senate they held a majority over all other parties.At the second general election (June, 1924), balances shifted somewhatfand the Legislative&quot; Assembly was returned with the Unione Politica and theiConstitutional Party each holding ten seats, Labour seven and the NationalIpemocratic Party five. The Unione Politica again took office, but, on suffer-ling a defeat, amalgamated with the National Democratic Party under the
name of the Nationalist Party. Until 1927 this Party remained in power and apart from a single instance, harmony prevailed between the two sides of thedyarchy.In August, 1927, elections were held in a somewhat heated atmosphereThe Constitutional Party, supported by the Labour Party, emerged with jsmall majority in the Legislative Assembly and Sir Gerald (later Lord)Strickland was entrusted as its leader with the task of forming a nejadministration. A series of violent disputes and deadlocks followed. The last of these concerned the need to ensure the supremacy of the LegislativeAssembly in matters of supply and it became eventually apparent that an amendment to the Letters Patent was necessary in order to limit the powetsof the Senate.Effect was given to this decision on the 7th August, 1928, but, meanwhile,bitter recriminations had broken out between Lord Strickland and the Churchauthorities on the age-old battlefield of the relations between Church and state. These were continued with increasing fervour throughout 1929 and1930 and finally involved His Majesty&apos;s Government in serious diplomaticdifficulties with the Vatican.In Malta itself, orderly administration had become impossible owing to theheat engendered by the various controversies the Senate, electoral laws,Trade Unions, the Judiciary, the language question and &quot; Italianity &quot;, etc,etc. which had arisen between one party and another and between Churchand State.   These led to a political crisis and on the 24th June, 1930, thePrime Minister stated in the House of Commons that, in all the circumstances&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government with considerable reluctance have decidedthat they have no alternative but to sanction a temporary suspension of the  Constitution.   The necessary legislation to give effect to this decision will be submitted to His Majesty in Council at an early date.   The effect will be to place as an emergency measure the full legislative and executive authority in the hands of the Governor.   The existing Ministry will,however, be retained in office and will be available in a consultativecapacity in so far as the Governor chooses to make use of their services.&quot;Thus, as from the issue of the new Letters Patent and Order in Council inJune, 1930, the Governor, to quote the report of the Royal Commission,became to all intents and purposes &quot; an autocrat, taking such advice as hemay think fit &quot;.A Royal Commission was appointed in April, 1931, &quot; to enquire into andreport upon the political situation in the Island &quot;. They reported at thebeginning of 1932 that the existing state of affairs &apos;&apos; ought not to be continualand that the Constitution should be restored &quot;. Many of the difficulties experienced need never, in their view, have occurred or could have beenaccommodated with the exercise of tact and forbearance.&quot;We do not feel&quot;, the Royal Commission finally reported, &quot;thatthere are sufficient grounds to support the opinion that the Maltese people are unable to manage their internal affairs, and we trust thatthe Imperial Government may be willing to take our view that theConstitution should be restored.&quot;At the same time they examined proposals made by various parties for ibamendment, made certain suggestions based thereon, and, as regards ofcproposals, held that most of them should be asked for or passed by ftgMaltese themselves rather than be imposed by outside authority.  The Repljof the Royal Commission was submitted to His Majesty on the 29th JanuajJ1932.
On the 4,th March, 1932, the following announcement was made in theHouse of Commons with simultaneous publication in Malta:  &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have given very careful considerationto the Report of the Malta Royal Commission and, subject to the state-ment that I shall make on two matters, have decided to give effectto all proposals which are set out by the Royal Commission in Chapter 14of the Report under the title &apos; Summary of Suggestions and of main commendation &apos;. The Constitution will be restored to the Island inaccordance with the Commission^ main recommendation, and steps willbe taken to give effect to the various other proposals in appropriateways by local Ordinances, by Letters Patent and by a Bill which willbe introduced in the Imperial Parliament. The Ordinances and letters patent will be issued and will take effect as soon as possible, while theBill to give effect to those proposals which involve legislation in theImperial Parliament will be introduced as soon as Parliaments timepermits.There is one particular matter arising out of the Report, upon whichit is necessary for me to make a somewhat detailed statement. TheHouse will have observed that on the question of language the majorityof the Commissioners have expressed strongly the view that in theinterests of the Maltese and of education in Malta, a change shouldbe made in the curriculum of the elementary schools in order to makeEnglish the only extra language to be taught in addition to the Maltesevernacular. At present in the higher standards of the elementary schoolsboth English and Italian are taught on an equal footing and the resultantloss in educational efficiency is strongly commented upon by the majorityof the Commissioners. The arguments advanced in support of the changes have received the careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government andappear to them to be unanswerable. The Government have accordingly decided to put this proposal into effect forthwith in common with theother proposals relating to languages contained in the Report.There is one further point upon which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave decided to depart from the actual terms of the recommendations contained in the Report. Amongst their recommendations with regardto the Judiciary, the Commissioners suggest that judicial appointmentsshould not in future be confined to Maltese. While accepting the other proposals of the Commissioners as regards the judges, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided that in all circumstances this particular pro-posal should not be adopted.I feel sure that I shall be expressing the sense of the House if, inconclusion, I pay tribute to the manner in which the Royal Commissionershave discharged a difficult and onerous task.&quot;On the 7th March a Proclamation was issued in Malta dissolving the senate and Legislative Assembly.The Malta Constitution (Amendment) Letters Patent of the 25th April,1932, followed, recognising English and Italian as &quot; equal languages of culturein Malta at the University and in the secondary schools &quot;, but laying down that English and Maltese &quot; shall be the only languages taught as subjects ofstudy in the elementary schools, and the Maltese language shall also be used as a medium for teaching the English language in so far as it may be neces-sary in the infants schools and the inferior classes of the elementary schools.In the examination for admission to the secondary schools, the studentsof the elementary schools and other candidates shall have to be approved in the English but not in any other language &apos;&apos;.   The Italian language was left specifically as the official language of record in the Malta Law Courts.
Elections were held on the nth, 12th and 13th June and resulted in thereturn of the Nationalist Party with a heavy majority.The Malta Constitution Act of the 12th July, 1932, followed, removing Bthe appointment and control of judges of the Superior Courts of Malta from ?the control of the local Legislature and ordaining that in future they should Bbe appointed by the Governor in the name of and on behalf of His Majesty IAt the same time, in view of the opinion expressed by the Royal Commission Ithat &quot; the treatment of the force has been too frequently influenced by party ftconsiderations &quot;, powers were taken to amend Section 41 of the Letters IPatent of 1921 so as to enable the control of the police also to be included among the &quot; reserved matters &quot;.   The consequential amendment was made Iin the Malta Constitution (Amendment) Letters Patent of 19th September 11933-These amendments unfortunately failed, in the atmosphere of recrimination Bprevailing, to achieve the desired effect of enabling the administration of the IIsland to proceed smoothly and efficiently, and on the 2nd November, 1933, 1it was found necessary again to dissolve the Legislature and suspend the Con- Istitution. The effect was a return to the position of 1930, the Governor Iruling the Island by Ordinances.It was during this second period of autocracy that there was passed the IMalta Constitution (Amendment) Letters Patent of the 16th August, 1934,making Maltese the general language of the Courts, although English, Maltese Band Italian remained recognised as official languages.It will be realised that by now the aggressive tendencies of fascist Italy mwere beginning to make themselves felt in various quarters, and it was no 1doubt largely on this account that the Nationalist Party, italianate in sympathy Iand culture, proved intractable.   By August, 1936, affairs had reached such Ia condition that the drastic step of revoking the Constitution had to be taken. IThis was done by Letters Patent dated 12th August and proclaimed in Malta Ion the 2nd September.   The responsibility lay squarely on the Nationalist BParty, then in power, who were unable or unwilling to combat the dangerous JJcampaign of intrigue and encroachment which, under fascist instigation, had %assumed such dangerous dimensions.CHAPTER 3.The Course of Events from August, 1936 to the end of 1945.The Letters Patent of the 12th August, 1936, provided for a Constitution Lwhich included an Executive Council composed of five ex-officio members (in 1addition to the Governor) and such other persons (nominated members), not flbeing less than three in number, as the Governor might from time to time l\appoint with the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.   In flj1938 there were six nominated members.At the same time, provision was made for the final settlement of the language question.   English and Maltese were made the official languages Iof Malta the former as the official language of administration and the latteras the official language of the Courts. The Italian language was not referred to tB an omission which was fully justified by the attempts which had been made \ &apos;during the preceding years to utilise the official sanction given to the Italian Hlanguage as a cloak for intrigue and encroachment by those who sympathised I -with Mussolini&apos;s belligerent nationalism.On the 25th February, 1939, yet another Constitution (now commonlyknown as the &quot; Macdonald Constitution &quot;) was framed for Malta. It provided Jfor tan Executive Council of five ex-officio members (in addition to the JJ
I governor) and such other persons (nominated members) as the Governor mightWorn time to time appoint with the approval of the Secretary of State.   Pro-vision was also made for a Council of Government of twenty members,composed of eight official members, ten elected members and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.As a result of the first elections held under this Constitution (on the 22nd,23rd and 24th July, 1939) the Constitutional Party led by Lieutenant-ColonelRoger Strickland obtained six seats, the Nationalist Party three seats and theLabour Party one seat.Italy entered the war on the 10th June, 1940, and during the next twoyears the people of Malta suffered grievous hardships. The splendour of theirresistance to the vicious and concentrated onslaughts of the enemy &quot; willlong&apos;&quot;, in the words of His Majesty, &quot; be famous in history.&quot;On the 10th November, 1942, statements were made in the House of Lordsby the Secretary of State for the Colonies and in the House of commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the following terms:  &quot; The repair of heavy damage inflicted by the enemy on Malta isclearly a task which will be beyond the unaided resources of the Govern-ment of Malta and property owners within any reasonable post-war period. I think there will be general agreement that the outstandinggallantry shown by the people of Malta in the face of enemy attacks ofunprecedented length and severity calls for some special recognition. Inview, therefore, of the unique position of Malta and the extraordinarysufferings which it has so gallantly undergone, His Majesty&apos;s government proposes to seek approval of Parliament for a free gift of  10,000,000 tothe Government of Malta to be used for the purposes of restoration ofwar damage and the rebuilding of Malta after the war. They proposethat this sum should be paid in the first place to trustees to be nominated,who will make the money available to the Government of Malta as andwhen required. The gift will be available for meeting liabilities underlegislation which, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, theGovernment of Malta has just put before the Council of Government,providing for schemes of compensation for war damage to property on lines generally similar to those in this country, as well as any other expenses incidental to post-war rebuilding. If the actual expenditure under those heads falls short of the total voted, the balance will be appliedto other purposes beneficial to Malta after the war. If on the other hand the total liability of the Malta Government for compensation and re-building, after allowing for contributions from property owners, exceeds the sum of  10,000,000, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared tomake available such further sums as may be required to meet liabilitieswhich are found in the circumstances as existing after the war to be beyond the capacity of the Government of Malta to meet from its own resources, having regard to all other calls upon those resources at thattime. A vote will be submitted to Parliament for the purpose as soon aspossible.&quot;Shortly afterwards, on the 29th November, the Executive Committee ofthe Constitutional Party adopted unanimously a resolution which read asfollows:  &quot; (i) That since the people of these islands only expected to work thepresent Constitution as a stepping-stone towards the attainment of malta&apos;s rights and status, the next elections (be held under a newConstitution, which would make Malta a self-governing partner in theBritish Commonwealth of Nations;
IO(ii) that an early declaration by the Secretary of State for thJColonies outlining the policy of the Imperial Government would mdesirable; \(iii) that His Excellency the Governor be asked to submit this resolj.tion to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.&quot;On the ist March, 1943, the Executive Committee of the Constitution!Party were informed that the Secretary of State did not regard the tinas opportune to consider the question of future constitutional changes jMalta.As a result of further representations made to the Governor by ColonelStrickland as leader of the Constitutional Party, which at that time comprise)a majority of the elected members in the Council of Government, a statement was made by the Secretary of State in the House of Commons on the7th July, 1943, which is quoted in the second paragraph of this Report.In a further statement in the House of Commons on the 13th July, 19^the Secretary of State used the following words: &quot; There was a period before the war when Malta enjoyed internal self-government. Honourable Members will recollect the circumstances which led to its withdrawal. Italian influence, Italian propaganda and,. I am afraid, in some cases, Italian money, wrecked that particularperiod of self-government, but in an Island which now has nothing for the Italians but hatred and contempt, all of us can look forward,after the war, to an experiment which was not a success before meeting with full success.&quot;On the 15th July, 1943, the following motion was passed in the Councilof Government with the support of all the elected members (i.e., six Con-stitutional members, three Nationalist members and one Labour member):-&quot; That this Council welcomes the announcement made by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons and by HisExcellency the Governor in this Council on the 7th July, 1943, whichpromises full legislative and administrative responsibility under theCrown to the people of Malta in the conduct of their internal affairsafter the war. And that the thanks of this Council, in the nameof the people of these Islands, be forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s government at Westminster.&quot;On the 23rd July, 1943, four days before the Council of Government whichhad been elected in 1939, was due to expire, new Letters Patent were passedamending the Malta Letters Patent, 1939, so as to provide for the con-tinuance of the Council of Government until dissolved by the Governor.. On the 8th December, 1943, the elected members of the Council ofGovernment circularised all constituted bodies recognised by the Government,inviting them to send two representatives each to a Congress which wouldtake steps to convene a National Assembly for the purpose of drafting anew Constitution for Malta. The Congress held their first meeting on the10th February, 1944, at the De La Salle Palace in Valletta. ColonelStrickland took the chair and, after reviewing the various steps which hadbeen taken since November, 1942, when the Executive of the ConstitutionalParty had petitioned the Secretary of State for the Colonies for a declarationof policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government, announced that the elected membersof the Council of Government had decided that a National Assembly shouldbe called by a Congress of the delegates of all constituted bodies recognised by Government in order to draw up a new Constitution for Malta.
Delegates of the following constituted bodies recognised by Governmentattended the Congress: The Congress decided to elect a Chairman and a Secretary who would remainin office until such time as the National Assembly had been convened and,after a secret ballot, Professor the Contino L. Preziosi, former president ofthe Senate under self-government, was elected.    Professor G. E. Degiorgiowas elected Secretary by acclamation.A Committee was then appointed with the following terms of reference: &quot; This Congress met on the National Feast of Malta nominates thefollowing:  Contino L. Preziosi, President of the Congress,Professor G. E. Degiorgio, Secretary of the Congress,Notary R. Frendo Randon, Assistant Secretary of the Congress,Lt.-Col. R. Strickland, Constitutional Party,Notary G. Borg Olivier, Nationalist Party,Dr. P. Boffa, Labour Party,Professor V. Caruana,to study and submit to the Congress at another sitting the best means of calling a National Assembly which will be truly representative of thewhole country and which will draft a new Constitution for responsible government in keeping with the promise made by the Imperial Govern-The National Congress met for the second time on the nth March, 1944,at the De La Salle Palace. The report of the Committee appointed at thefirst meeting to suggest the best ways and means of calling a National Assemblywas then considered. It was agreed that in order to avoid unwieldinessrepresentation of the various bodies should be limited to a maximum of two persons.The National Congress held a third sitting on 20th May, 1944, and itwas decided to invite the bodies set out above to send delegates to form theNational Assembly. It was also decided that any other bodies, who werenot included in the list but who considered that they should be invited,should submit applications not later than the 29th June.The National Congress met for the fourth time on 19th August, 1944,and the Secretary (Professor Degiorgio) referred to correspondence whichhad passed between the Congress and the General Workers&apos; Union in whichit was stated that the General Workers&apos; Union felt compelled to abstain from participating in the National Assembly owing to their dissatisfaction withthe representation allowed to them.Further sittings of the Congress were held on the 2nd September, the 7thOctober and the 2nd December, and the question of the representation of theGeneral Workers&apos; Union in the National Assembly was again discussed. Asa result of decisions taken, the General Workers&apos; Union agreed to participate.The National Congress then passed a motion &quot; that the National Assemblybe convoked on the 20th January, 1945, at three o&apos;clock in the Hall of St.Michael and St. George at the Palace, Valletta,&quot; and adjourned sine die.Church.Ndbility.Chamber of Advocates.Camera medical.Chamber of Commerce.Trade Union Council.Chamber of Architects.Notarial Council.Chamber of Chemists.Chamber of Legal Procurators.Society of Arts.Manufacturers and Commerce.Agrarian Society.Malta Union of Teachers.ment.
In January, 1945, the Government of Malta made it known that the Secre-tary of State proposed to appoint a Financial Adviser to visit Malta toexamine and report on the financial position.On the 22nd March, 1945, the Governor forwarded to the Secretary ofState, at the request of the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, a copyof a resolution which, it was stated, had been approved by acclamation ata mass meeting held in Hamrun, intimating that the elected members of theCouncil of Government no longer enjoyed the confidence of the people andrequesting the Governor to take immediate steps for the holding of elections.Eventually it was decided to hold elections under the existing constitution in the autumn of 1945.Meanwhile, throughout 1945, the National Assembly had been meetingperiodically under the chairmanship of Professor the Contino Preziosi, butnot much progress had been made by the time the Governor broadcast tothe people of Malta on the 1st September, 1945.In the course of his broadcast, the Governor emphasized that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognised Malta&apos;s great services to the allied cause during thewar and that they were most anxious to implement the promise made in1943 to restore to the Maltese people responsible government in the samesphere as they enjoyed between 1921 and 1933. The Governor said that itwas indeed fitting that the Maltese should now assume their former responsi-bility for the management of their own affairs, and stressed that it was amatter of concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government that there should be noexcuse for or any cause of avoidable delay in making good their promise.The Governor went on to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government had hitherto been awaiting the recommendations of the National Assembly on the formthe new Constitution should take, and being most anxious to afford any assistance that might be possible in hastening the introduction of the newConstitution, they felt it would be helpful if a Commissioner of suitablestanding and wide experience were appointed to visit Malta to consult repre-sentative opinion. In his terms of reference the Constitutional commissioner would be empowered to discuss the formulation of detailed proposals regard-ing the form of the new Constitution and any other matters bearing on thegrant of responsible government. The Governor also pointed out that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were fully alive to the importance of the financial problems on which a decision had to be reached before the new Constitutioncould be inaugurated, and announced that it was with the object of obtaining a full survey of these matters that the Secretary of State had appointed SirWilfrid Woods to visit Malta. The point was also stressed that since, pend-ing decisions on these problems, the Government of the country had to becarried on, it was essential that there should be a Council of Governmentin being to advise the Government of Malta and to pass any legislation whichmight be necessary for the conduct of the administration. In these circum-stances, the Governor stated, he proposed to dissolve the Council of Govern-ment and hold new elections.The Council was dissolved on the 8th September and the elections for anew Council, which were held on the iofh, nth and 12th November, resultedin the election of nine Labour members and one Independent member.Meanwhile, in May, 1945, Sir Wilfrid Woods had arrived in Malta &quot; toexamine the present and prospective financial position of the Malta Govern-ment in the light of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that responsible government should be granted to Malta after the war.&quot; The object of hisenquiry was to make a comprehensive survey on the basis of which theSecretary of State might reach decisions in regard to the financial relationsbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Malta Government.
Sir Wilfrid Woods returned to London in July and submitted his Reportio the Secretary of State on the 6th September, 1945.CHAPTER 4.The Course of Events in 1946 Discussions with the Finance Committee andformation of the Constitutional Committee.It was announced on the 4th January, 1946, that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies had appointed me as Constitutional Commissioner to visitMalta with the terms of reference already cited in the opening paragraphs ofthis Report. During the months of February, March and April, I was engaged on preliminary work in the Colonial Office, and on the 4th May Iarrived in Malta by air, accompanied by Mr. J. Fletcher-Cooke of the ColonialAdministrative Service. Two days later I broadcast to the people of Maltaa brief address, a copy of which forms Appendix IV of this Report.One of my first acts, after paying a number of courtesy calls, was to confer with the Chairman of the National Assembly, Professor the Contino Preziosi,regarding the procedure to be followed. A cordial welcome was accorded tome and it was arranged that I should be introduced by him to the national assembly and address them regarding my mission in the Hall of St. Michaeland St. George on the evening of the 10th May. Of the four hundred andtwenty-one members of the National Assembly two hundred and sixty-threeattended. The proceedings were of a friendly but purely formal nature. Acopy of my speech is given in Appendix V, and in Appendix VI will befound a statement furnished by Mr. R. G. Miller, Secretary of the National8 Assembly (and also Secretary of the General Workers&apos; Union), setting outthe various bodies represented in the National Assembly as at the date ofray meeting with them.During the days which followed I was able to make many informal contacts with individuals and groups among all classes of the population, and to seesomething of the islands of Malta and Gozo at my leisure. No progressI could, however, be made with formal business, since it was clear that public&apos; opinion favoured some elucidation of the financial background before com-mitting its representatives to discussion of constitutional issues, and, untilthe contents of the Woods Report and the extent of the assistance whichmight be expected from His Majesty&apos;s Government were known, this back-ground remained obscure.A Finance Committee had been elected by the National Assembly on the[8th May, 1945, &quot; to enquire into the economic situation of the Island andto report to the National Assembly &quot;. It consisted of seven members, namely,Sir. A. Cassar Torreggiani, O.B.E. (Chairman), Mr. J. Ellul Mercer(Secretary), The Hon. Dr. P. Boffa, O.B.E. (Leader of the elected members in the Council of Government), the Most Rev. Canon Mgr. C. Bormici,.D.D., B.L.Can., Professor P. P. Debono, O.B.E., M.D., D.P.H., F.R.C.S.,I Mr. Moses Gatt, and Mr. R. G. Miller. The Report of this, Committee hadkeen completed but had not been considered by the National Assemblypending the Committee&apos;s discussions with myself.On the 20th May, Mr J. Ellul Mercer tendered his resignation from theFinance Committee for reasons of health, and shortly afterwards The Hon.Dr. A. F. Colombo, M.D., was elected in his place.On the 15th May I was able to arrange my first meeting with this body(three of its members were unable to attend) and on your instructions, II landed to them in confidence copies of the Woods Report.
10,000,000Total      ......      42&apos;437.75o.&quot;He had added: - &quot; . . . but any such sum as  40,000,000 would seem to be far inexcess of anything which His Majesty&apos;s Government could reasonably beasked either to meet by a single payment or to commit itself irrevocablyto meeting by instalments.&quot;I took the opportunity of drawing members&apos; attention in particular tothese precautionary words.My next meeting with the Finance Committee took place on the 23rd May,in order that they might furnish me with their general comments on the contents of the Woods Report.  This they did without prejudice to the raising of other points at a later stage, and during the proceedings the Chairmanhanded me a formal resolution signed by himself, which read as follows:-&quot; With regard to the recommendations as to a method of settlement,it is the considered opinion of the Board of the National assembly that the items appearing in paragraph 162 (/) and (g) should not beincluded as a subject due for settlement, once the House of commons in England has&apos; already pronounced itself on the question when a definitepromise was given to make good all damage to buildings effected throughhostilities by the generous grant of  10,000,000 and more if necessary(vide Appendix &quot; E &quot;, page 67).   A special law, similar to that prevalentin the United Kingdom was enacted in Malta, and the property ownershave contributed towards the fund as provided for in the law.  We there-for submit that this payment, whether it exceeds or otherwise the sug-gested  28,800,000 should not form part of our discussion, but shouldbe treated as a settled affair, independently of self-government and underthe present organisation, and in accordance with the relative legislationapproved both by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of malta.&quot;At the request of the Committee I promised to forward this resolution,together with the Committee&apos;s general comments to you.In paragraph 162 of his Report, Sir Wilfrid Woods had made a series of recommendations for ad hoc grants for specific purposes as follows: -   &quot; (a) Budget   deficit   ( 277,000   in1946-47   and    304,000   in1947-48)       ......      ... 581,000(b) Extension of sewers   ...      ... 1,600,000(c) Extension of water supply   ... 500,000(d) New Education buildings andequipment    ......      ... 408,750(e) New    Medical    and    Healthbuildings and equipment ... 548,000(/) War       Damage,       including 10,000,000   already   trans-ferred to trustees   ...      ... 26,800,000(g) War Damage to property of the malta Government ...      ... 2,000,000(h) Reconstruction           ...      ... 3,000,000Town   improvements,    dwell-ings, shops, &amp;c.     ...      ... 7,000,000
On the 31st May, 1946, the Woods Report* was laid on the table at aspecial meeting of the Council of Government and published simultaneously inthe United Kingdom.The next ten days provided an opportunity for the Maltese Press and public in general, and the Finance Committee in particular, to digest and study the implications of the Woods Report, and in the evening of the 10th June I had afurther meeting with the Finance Committee at the Chairman&apos;s country houseat Wardia. At the close of our discussions the Committee asked me to tele-graph to you in the following terms:  &quot; After discussing the economic position of Malta with the Constitu-tional Commissioner, it was agreed that he should be requested to askHis Majesty&apos;s Government to indicate as soon as possible the.extent ofassistance that they are prepared to give to Malta, apart from the re-imbursement of war damage.&quot;I undertook to convey this request to you by telegram, together with various other representations upon which members of the Committee had laid specialstress.Pending the response of His Majesty&apos;s Government there was little I could do but continue the process of making myself amicably acquainted with thepersonalities and life of Malta and Gozo. It was apparent that no inclinationexisted to force the pace in any quarter and press comment upon my Missionalmost ceased.On the 9th July the new Governor, Mr. F. C. R. Douglas, arrived. Onthe same day the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the financial settlement was made public (see Appendices VII and VIII). considerable attention was naturally given during the following months by the Press andpublic to the implications of this settlement and its effects upon the prospects of self-government. On the whole, it may be said, the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government was received, if not with manifestations of gratitude,with some degree of relief, but the controversy, which focussed largely upon  the twin questions of the taxation likely to be imposed and of the agency toundertake the responsibility of imposing it, did not altogether die down duringthe period of my stay in the Island. It was made clear on the 18th July tothe Finance Committee, and consequently to the public, that the financialI settlement was final but this did not prevent recurrent attempts to reopen the\ question.I It was not until the 25th July that it was possible to open discussions upon  purely constitutional matters. The National Assembly had, it is true,I appointed a Committee for this purpose as early as the 7th June, but, first the uncertainty regarding the financial background and, subsequently, the 8 need for the dominant political party to make sure of sufficient popular sup-I port to justify their acceptance of office, had led to delay.I Eventually the Committee expressed themselves as ready to do business.they   were a strong and representative body, consisting of the following:  Chairman: Professor the Contino L. Preziosi, B.Sc, M.D., D.O.(Oxon.), Chairman of the National Assembly, Chairman of the national congress of 1944, and a former President of the Senate.The Hon. Dr. P. Boffa, O.B.E., leader of the Labour Party and of the elected members in the Council of Government, and prospective PrimeMinister under the new Constitution. -Professor J. Hyzler, B.Sc, M.D., Professor of Forensic Medicine atthe Royal University of Malta and ex-member of the Legislative Assembly.* Colonial No. 196, 1946.
* For the minutes of this meeting see Appendix XI,The Most Rev. Canon Monsignor C. Bonnici, D.D., B.L.Can., pro.professor of Moral Theology at the Royal University of Malta.Mr. R. G. Miller, Secretary of the National Assembly and also of theGeneral Workers&apos; Union.I do not question that there may be among the people of Malta otherspossessing similar qualifications whose assistance would have been of signalvalue, but it is a truth of general appreciation that business discussions are more effective and fruitful when the number of participants is limited to acomparatively small number of those well qualified to conduct them. Thisgranted, I find it difficult to believe that any stronger or more representative body could have been chosen to speak for the National Assembly or that anyother body than the National Assembly could have been more representativeof the people of Malta as a whole. I feel, therefore, that in dealing with a constitutional Committee composed as above, I was in truth consulting, as my terms of reference required, with &quot; representatives of the Maltese people&quot;.On my first arrival in Malta, both in my broadcast of the 6th May (Appendix IV) and in my address of the ioth May (Appendix V) I made it clear thatI was very ready to listen to all and sundry who might have views to express,and a certain number of bodies and individuals took advantage of the invitation. I did not, however, go out of my way specifically to inviteothers for two reasons:  in the first place, it would have been difficult ifnot impossible, to avoid charges of discrimination; in the second place, Iwas anxious, while remaining accessible to anyone who wished to see me.to avoid any action likely to give offence to the National Assembly or itsConstitutional Committee or lead the public to imagine for a moment that Idoubted the qualifications of their chosen representatives to speak for them.Part II of this Report contains a record of the matters discussed betweenthe Constitutional Committee and myself between the 25th July and the 20thAugust, and my recommendations. At the close of the discussions the Com-mittee reported to the National Assembly, which met for the purpose on the30th August, the 6th September and the 13th September. On the 16thSeptember our final meeting was held at the Palace, Valletta,* and the Com-mittee informed me that the National Assembly had endorsed in their entiretythe views which they had expressed during their discussions with me. despite the fact that unanimity had not been possible on all points, the atmosphereremained, as ever, most cordial and friendly.I left Malta with my parry by air on Thursday the 19th September for theUnited Kingdom.
PART  IIDISCUSSIONS   WITH   THE   constitutional committee   AND   RECOMMENDATIONSCHAPTER 5.Introductory.My first meeting with the Constitutional Committee was held on the25th July and was largely concerned with questions of procedure. * Thereafterwe met, as a rule, on alternate days. Minutes were kept throughout in agreedform, one copy being signed by myself and initialled by the Chairman of theConstitutional Committee and one signed by the Chairman and initialled bymyself, f   The full record of these minutes will be found in Appendix IX.Both at our first meeting and subsequently it was made clear by the Com-mittee that though they represented the National Assembly as a whole, andthe National Assembly represented the people of Malta as a whole, they were bound by their terms of reference only to discuss the various subjects at issuewithin the terms laid down by the National Assembly. They were notempowered to accept amendments^ but were prepared to recommend to theNational Assembly and fully support any amendments the case for which seemed to them good.   This position I accepted. JThe National Assemibly&apos;s Draft, g in its arrangement of sections, closelyfollowed the Constitution of 1921 as amended up to 1933. By common consent,however, in the discussions with the Constitutional Committee, matters were discussed under the heads of principles and subjects, the order being chosenat will, rather than section by section in the order&apos; adopted in the two documents before us. This procedure had the advantage of allowing subjects which were inter-related by principle, or which had affinity to one another,to be taken at the same or at consecutive sittings. It also served to emphasizethe fact that the work of the joint session was not an attempt to draft a legal document a matter to he left to your Legal Advisers but to come tothe greatest possible measure of agreement upon principles or, when agree-ment was impossible, to clarify and define the arguments underlying con-conflicting views. 11By general agreement we tackled the most contentious subjects first, namely,the Second Chamber and, thereafter, in turn, the &quot; reserved matters &quot; and themethod of enactment of the new Constitution and various points arising there-from. The paragraphs which follow correspond, broadly speaking, withthe order of our discussions, but it will be seen from the minutes (Appendix IX)that many exceptions occur to this generalisation.CHAPTER 6.The Two Houses of the Legislature.(A) the second chamber.When self-government was first granted in 1921, it was provided that theLegislature should consist of a Senate and a Legislative Assembly. The Senatewas composed of seventeen members, namely, ten &quot; Special &quot; and seven&quot; General &quot; members.   The latter had to be males of 35 years or upwards* Appendix IX (1) para. 4.t Appendix IX (1) para. 4B.t Appendix IX (1) para. 4C.5 Appendix X.11 Appendix IX (4)Jpara. 4.
qualified as voters for the election of &quot;General&quot; members and having Icertain status.   The &quot; Special &quot; members were:  IH(a) Two representatives of the Clergy, nominated by the Archbishop Iof Malta;(b) Two representatives of and elected by the Nobility;(c) Two representatives of and elected by &quot;the Graduates;(d) Two representatives of and elected by the Chamber of Commerce; p(e) Two representatives of and elected by the Trade Union Councils &apos; 1With certain minor amendments relating to the qualifications of voters, the &apos;position remained unchanged until the revocation of the Constitution inAugust, 1936.The questions arising fall under two main heads:(a). whether the Second Chamber should be revived or a single cham- Iber government instituted;(&amp;) if there is to be a Second Chamber, what should be its numbers,composition, powers and the qualifications of its members.As regards (a), speaking in general terms, the Labour Party prefer aSingle Chamber System; those who oppose them prefer a bi-cameral system. IThe National Assembly in 1946 adopted an indefensible compromise.  Having first decided in favour of a second &quot; Advisory &quot; Chamber they then pro- jceeded at a subsequent meeting to make it somewhat ridiculous.   Its number was to be thirteen; the qualifying age (male or female) was fixed at 21, andappointment though technically in the hands of the Governor, was to bemade on the advice of the Head of the Ministry, with the leader or leadersof the Opposition having the right &quot; to submit &quot; (sic) the names of four of the members.   The, length of life of this curiously inadequate body, whichcould obviously do little more than reflect the views of the Ministry of theday, was to be coterminous with that of the Legislative Assembly.The powers of the Second Chamber were also considerably reduced in theNational Assembly&apos;s draft. The Constitution of 1921 had given the Senatecertain qualified powers of rejection and provided, in case of disagreement, for joint sittings of the Legislative Assembly and the Senate to decide theissue. The National Assembly advised, tout court, that &quot; If the LegislativeAssembly passes any proposed Law or Money Bill and the Advisory Chamberrejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the Legis-lative Assembly will not agree, it shall be deemed to have been duly passedby the Legislature.&quot;No distinction, it will be noted, was drawn between &quot; Money Bills &quot; andother Bills.The 1921 Constitution had provided that, while the Senate might notalter a Money Bill, it might return it to the Legislative Assembly with recommendations for its amendment. If these amendments were not acceptedby the Legislative Assembly, the Senate could either accept or reject theBill but had no power to alter it. Under the Letters Patent of the1st August, 1928, this power of the Senate to reject a Money Bill was restricted by local legislation and, and as a result, the Senate was deemed to have accepted any Money Bill which came before it for a second time and itwas &quot; taken to have been duly passed by the Legislature.&quot;In brief, not only were the findings of the National Assembly by an arrow majority against privilege of the kind previously recognised through-out the history of Malta, but the heat of controversy engendered causedlittle serious account to be taken of the possibility of preserving such value* No Trades Union Council was, in fact, ever formed.
attaches to the existence of a body competent, as a buffer between theGovernor and a possibly precipitate Legislative Assembly, to reduce friction between the Imperial authorities and the Government of Malta, to afford timeand opportunity for second thoughts, and to give to the Island the benefit tobe derived from the experience and wisdom of its &quot; elder statesmen &quot;and persons of eminence in various professions and occupations.The Soulbury Commission* were faced in Ceylon with difficulties notdissimilar to those encountered in Malta. There also the widest divergence of views was experienced and finally the Commission came to the con-clusion that the balance of :argument lay in favour of a Second Chamberwith strictly limited powers. His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted a recom-mendation in this sense and the Ceylon Constitution of 1946 provides fora Senate of thirty Senators of whom fifteen are elected by the House ofRepresentatives and fifteen appointed by the Governor acting &quot; in his discretion &quot;. In other words, the Governor is bound to consult the PrimeMinister in making these appointments but he is not obliged to accept thePrime Minister&apos;s advice. He is also permitted to consult any persons or bodieswho he is satisfied are representative of any profession or occupation incomplying with the requirement that he is to &quot; endeavour to appointpersons who, in his judgment, have rendered distinguished public service or are persons of eminence in professional, commercial, industrial or agri-cultural life, including education, law, medicine, science, engineering andbanking.&quot;All these points were discussed at some length with the constitutional committee, f They found themselves in something of a quandary since,on the one hand, they felt bound to support the recommendations of theNational Assembly, and, on the other, they recognised the anomaly involvedin voting, for a Second Chamber at one meeting and then proceeding at asecond meeting to make it ridiculous. My own part was limited to making itclear that I was prepared to recommend to you either that there shouldbe no Second Chamber at all or that there should be one reasonably equippedby virtue of its composition, the qualifications of its members and thescope of its powers, to serve a really useful purpose.At first there was some reluctance, upon grounds which I can well appreciatein view of the excitement which surrounded the question of a second chamber when it was discussed in the National Assembly, to refer it backto that body, but eventually it was agreed that there was no reasonablealternative .JWhen the National Assembly met on 30th of August, with 185 memberspresent out of a possible 421, to receive the report of the constitutional committee, the only change which they were prepared to accept in respectof the Second Chamber was that of an age limit of 35 in place of 21. their recommendations concerning its title of &apos;-&apos; Advisory Chamber &quot;, its powersand its composition were re-affirmed unanimously, and a rider was addedto the effect that if these proposals were unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the National Assembly would prefer to have no Second Chamberat all.   This rider was passed by a majority of 25.In the light of the above, I have no longer any hesitation in recommending that there should be no Second Chamber. The matter is essentially one forthe decision of the Maltese themselves and the only difficulty has been to discover what Maltese public opinion in reality desires. It is true, tedh-nically speaking, that their original vote in favour of a Second Chamber,* Report of the Commission on Constitutional Reform, Ceylon (Cmd. 6677), 1945.t Appendix IX (3) paras. 5 and 6.J Appendix IX (3) para. 6.
though passed by a narrow majority, still stands; but in effect, they havenullified it and that deliberately by subsequent resolutions which depriveit of all usefulness, and I regard the rider above quoted as little short of an invitation to His Majesty&apos;s Government to quash the original motion.Had the considerable body of persons who are in favour of a second chamber competent to exercise a real influence upon the Government ofthe Island, desired to press their views, it was open to them to do so byattendance and voting at the meetings of the National Assembly.(B)   the legislative  assembly.*No contentious issues such as arose in the case of the Second Chambertroubled the course of my discussions with the Maltese representatives re-garding the Legislative Assembly.! Certain changes from the order of1921-33 were proposed but they commanded general assent and were not ofa kind to which His Majesty&apos;s Government need raise any objection.The most important of these \ was the inclusion of the principle of femalesuffrage on a basis of equality between the sexes in all respects. the qualifying age of 21 for registration as a voter at the election of membersof either House of the Legislature, and the system of the proportional repre-sentation, were re-adopted by the National Assembly. At the same time,certain requirements in respect of literacy, the holding of property and thenon-receipt of charitable relief, were removed.A few amendments involving no important point of principle, and eitherconsequential upon these alterations or justified by common-sense arguments,were also proposed.  These included -(i) an increase in the number of the members of the LegislativeAssembly from thirty-two to forty and of the quorum from sixteen to twenty-one;(ii) an increase in the normal length of life of the Legislative Assemblyfrom three years to four (four being, in fact, the present figure under theConstitution granted in 1939);(hi) a request that Section 33 of the 1921 Constitution (which left allcases concerning the right of any person to be a member of either Houseof the Legislature to be decided by the local Court of Appeal) should,when re-incorporated in the new Constitution, state in so many words thatthis decision is final as indeed it is by a decision of His Majesty&apos;privy Council in 1930.I recommend acceptance of these proposals.In Section 32(a)(iv) of their draft, the Assembly have added &quot; civilianemployees &quot; of the Service Departments to the fist of those who &quot; shall notbe deemed to hold any office of profit under the Crown &quot;. The effect of this amendment would be to permit such civilian employees to be elected to either House of the Legislature.The Committee realised, of course, that if this permissive proviso was tohave the desired effect, the staff regulations of the Service Departments in malta would also have to be amended. The existing rule in Malta, as in theUnited Kingdom, is governed by the &quot; Servants of the Crown (parliamentary candidature) Order, 1927 &quot; which was based on the recommendations of theBlanesburgh Committee of 1925. J Under this rule as applied to Malta, nocivilian employee of the Service Departments may stand for election until he* See Sections 12 et seq of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent 1921 and Section 9et seq   of the National Assembly&apos;s draft.t Appendix ix (10) para. 4(1), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii).% Cmd. 2408.
has retired or resigned from the public service, but an exception is made in thecase of certain &quot; industrial &quot; employees who are permitted to stand for election provided they tender their resignations provisionally before doing so. If their candidature is successful their resignations become effective; rfit is unsuccessful the resignations are regarded as withdrawn and the periodof absence from duty is treated as absence on special leave without pay.The Malta Labour Party and the General Workers&apos; Union urged that this rule should be altered as follows:  (a) that the privilege of being able to stand for election to theLegislature while still in employment should no longer be restricted to&quot; industrial &quot; employees but be extended to cover all civilian employees of the Service Departments;(b) that any employee who is successful in an election should havethe right if he fails to be re-elected at the next election to claim reinstate-ment in the Service Department with which he previously served on thesame terms and with the same seniority as if he had never left it, but without any increases of pay which he would have automatically earned if his service had not been interrupted.In support of their request, the following arguments were adduced:  (i) that so large and important a proportion of the population were employed in H.M. Dockyard (in particular) and so vital was the part theyplayed and must continue to play in the life of the Island that it wasillogical and unfair that they should be debarred from direct participation in political responsibility;(2) that the analogies drawn from corresponding practice in the UnitedKingdom were faulty. In the United Kingdom there may be good reasons to prevent a civilian employee of the Service Departments from taking a directive share in the political life of its own government. in malta the point at issue is whether an employee of the Imperial Govern-ment can rightly be debarred from taking a directive share in the life of the Maltese Government. It is suggested that when the BlanesburghCommittee recommended in their report of 1925* that the rules governing the position of Malta should follow the lines laid down in respect of theUnited Kingdom, they overlooked the essential difference between theUnited Kingdom and Malta in this respect. In the former case it is aquestion of permitting employees to take an active part in the work of the body which employs them; in the latter it is not.(3) the principle advocated had been to some extent admitted, whenpermission was given to civilian employees of the Services as distinct from employees of the Government of Malta, to become members ofthe National Assembly.I informed the Committee as I had already told the Labour Party thatwhile I appreciated the cogency of these arguments and hoped that it mightbe found possible to meet their request, any alteration in the Service Depart-ments&apos; rules lay outside my competence. I can but express the hope that you may be willing to take this matter up with the Service Departments with aview to effecting such changes as may be practicable. Even if the service departments are not prepared to meet the requests of the Labour Party andthe General Workers&apos; Union in full it would seem that some minor amendtiemtto Section 31(1) (e) of the 1921 Constitution will be necessary in order to take account of the fact that under the existing rules &quot; industrial &quot; employees are permitted, conditionally, to stand for election to the Legislature while still inthe employment of the Service Departments.!* Cmd. 2408.t Appendix IX (10) para. 4 (vii).
Section 44 (b) of the 1921 Constitution (repeated verbatim by the national assembly under the same number) states that when a law has been passedby the Legislature, it shall be presented for assent to the Governor. There-after, if it appears to the Governor to contain any provision in any wayrelating to or affecting any &quot; reserved matter &quot;, he shall return it to theLegislature for reconsideration and if they fail to amend it to his satisfactionhe shall, if so required by the Ministry, &quot; submit to the Secretary of Statefor his decision the question whether such law affects any reserved matter,and the decision of the Secretary of State shall for all purposes whatsoeverbe final &quot;.* Appendix IX (4) para. 6.CHAPTER 7. L&quot; Reserved Matters &quot;.*(A) general. &apos;At no stage in my discussions with the Constitutional Committee was there gany vestige of a tendency to query the right of the Imperial side of the Idyarchy to full control within its own proper sphere.   In very few cases was fthere even an inclination to effect any change in the boundary line betweenit and the sphere allotted by the Constitution of 1921 to the Government of IMalta.    The point which repeatedly emerged was that the Maltese were more concerned to obtain guarantees that fuller opportunities were given fortheir point of view to be heard than to deny the rights of the Imperial Gov-ernment.   In a number of cases, however, the method of rectification adoptedby the National Assembly had been the extreme one of removing the subjectspecified bodily from the list of &quot; reserved matters &quot;.  This was, unconsciouslyperhaps, their riposte to what they felt to be the brusque and wholesalemethods of the 1921 Constitution.   As a general rule the underlying grounds of objection appeared to me to be not without foundation, and I felt justifiedin engaging to recommend to you certain methods for ensuring that fullerconsideration should be given to Maltese local interests.The definition of certain of the &quot; reserved matters&quot; in section 41 (1) ofthe Constitution of 1921 is, perhaps, open to the charge of over-generalisationand ultra-simplification (e.g., &quot; immigration &quot;, &quot; coinage and currency &quot;) asa result of which a suspicion has been engendered that the Imperial Gov-ernment deliberately intended, by &quot; reserving &quot; the whole field tout court,to preclude or discourage due weight being given to the legitimate rights and interests of the Maltese.I recommend: - (a) that, whenever there is room for doubt as to the precise meaning orscope of any of these brief and general heads, the new Constitution shouldmake clear the limits of their applicability and their meaning;(b) that, in order to give fuller weight to local susceptibilities of a reason-able kind, the Imperial representatives should be instructed to consult the maltese Government more frequently in cases where the interests of the latter are concerned. A number of specific cases in which this procedure appearsparticularly desirable will be found cited in the later sections of this report which deal with &quot; reserved &quot; and cognate matters seriatim.
Similarly, Section 66 (2) (repeated verbatim by the National Assembly as^Section 63 (2)), which deals with certain powers previously exercised bythe Lieutenant-Governor and subsequently transferred to the Governor inCouncil, provides that if any question arises as to whether the exercise ofthose powers affects any &quot; reserved matter &quot;, &quot; the Governor may of hisown motion or shall, if so requested by the Ministry, submit such question to the Secretary of State for his decision, and the decision of the Secretaryof State shall for all purposes whatsoever be final &quot;.Section 41 (1) of the 1921 Constitution (Section 42 (1) of the national assembly&apos;s draft) provides that the law-making powers of the Maltese Gov-ernment shall not extend to the &quot; reserved matters &quot;; but it fails to providefor an arbiter in case of dispute whether a law passed by the maltese government encroaches upon a &quot; reserved matter &quot; or not. This is opento the serious objection that it may lead to constant reference to the Courts.A further point arises in connection with the present form of this Section41 (1). The &quot; reserved matters &quot; referred to include &quot; matters touching... the general interests of our subjects not resident in Malta.&quot; this might be interpreted as excluding, e.g., Customs legislation, from the purview of the Legislature, although such is within their scope.These points were put to the Constitutional Committee and they acceptedtheir validity. * They added the useful suggestion that it would be convenient to have a single Section providing for reference to the Secretary of State inall such cases rather than a series of Sections.I recommend that:  (a) it be specifically laid down in the new Constitution that in case of any doubt arising under any Section whether a law passed or power exercised bythe Maltese Government affects or relates to any &quot; reserved matter &quot;, thedecision of the Secretary of State shall be final;(b) an amendment be made to the wording of Section 41 (1) to remove thepossibility of ambiguity.A subsidiary question arises under Section 43 of the 1921 Constitution,namely that of the stage at which the Governor is empowered to interposehis authority and hold up action by the Legislature on the ground that a&quot;reserved matter &quot; is affected. The National Assembly by cutting outSection 43, sought to debar the Governor from intervening until after the bill had been passed by both&apos; Houses of the Legislature (Section 44), and theCommittee argued, not, as seemed to me without reason, that it was bothimpracticable and unreasonable to debar the Legislature from full liberty of debate, irrespective of the action which the Governor might feel boundto take if a bill were subsequently passed. I am disposed to recommendacceptance of the proposal to delete Section 43. j(B) PARTICULAR.&quot; The control of discipline of Our naval, military or air forces &quot;.No question was raised and I recommend this sub-Section be re-incorporated in the new Constitution, g* Appendix IX (8) para. 4 (i).t Appendix IX (8) para. 4 (ii).J This and following references are to corresponding subsections of section 41(1) of the malta Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 as amended up to 1933.5 Appendix IX (4) para. 6 (iii).
(b) &quot; The defence of the Island, the compulsory acquisition (subject to thepayment of reasonable compensation to be assessed in such manner as mabe determined by the Governor) of lands and buildings for naval and militar]purposes, or any other naval or military matter including all vessels of thefollowing description, viz. the King&apos;s ships of War, Royal Fleet Auxiliaryand, Dockyard Craft, and any matter directly or indirectly affecting any swellvessel &quot;.Tihe National Assembly had represented that all provisions relating to the compulsory acquisition of land, etc., for the Services, whether under this orany other sub-Section, should be made subject to the consent of the privy council of Malta, and also that the power of assessing compensation in allcases of compulsory acquisition should be removed from the Governor and left to be determined by local law. Discussion made it clear that the essentialobjective was to ensure that compulsory acquisition by the Services couldnot be carried out in too arbitrary a manner and that the method of assessingcompensation should be the same as that followed in the case of civil require-ments, without discrimination. I made it clear that the consent of the privy council could not be made a pre-requisite to acquisition for the purposesreferred to, but engaged to offer certain suggestions and recommendations toyou with a view to removing the sense of grievance which was evidentlvfelt. 1My recommendations are as follows: (i) that compulsory acquisition and compensation as previously covered by sub--Sections (b) and (c) should continue to be &quot; reserved &quot; but should betreated independently in a separate sub-Section, the contents of (b) being,as the National Assembly suggested, confined to &quot; The Defence of the Island &quot;simpliciter.*(ii) that the Governor should be required (possibly in the Royal Instruc-tions) to refer all requests by the Service Departments for compulsory acquisi-tion of land etc., to the Privy Council of Malta, in order that each case maybe fully ventilated and the views of both the Services and the Maltese Ministersconsidered; and that, unless agreement is reached he should, if so requested bya majority of the Privy Council, refer the matter to you for your decision, f(iii) that the Governor, in determining the manner in which &quot; reasonablecompensation &quot; is to be assessed, should be required to refer each case to aboard of assessment upon which the Maltese are adequately represented.!(c) &quot; The control and regulation of aerial navigation and the compulsory acquisition (subject to the payment of reasonable compensation as aforesaid)of land and buildings for the purpose of aerodromes or for any other purposeconnected with aerial navigation or aerial defence.&quot;The amendments proposed by the National Assembly would, if accepted,have the effect of removing civil aviation from the list of &quot; reserved matters &quot;.On my explaining to the Committee at some length the necessary co-relation between all forms of aviation, the need to safeguard international conventions and give effect to reciprocal arrangements they readily agreed to restore civilaviation to the fold.I recommend that the control of all forms of aviation be a &quot; reserved \matter &quot;, but that questions of compulsory acquisition and compensation bedealt with as suggested.!* Appendix IX (4) para. 6 (iv).f Appendix IX (5) para. 5 (i).I Appendix IX (4) para. 6 (v).
* Appendix IX (4) para. 6 (vi).t Appendix IX (4) para. 6 (vii).% Appendix IX (5) para. 5 (i).(d) &quot; Surveys for naval, military or aerial defence purposes.&quot;The National Assembly had omitted this sub-Section en bloc, apparentlyfearing that &quot; survey &quot; was a mere preliminary to compulsory acquisition.This impression I was able to remove.I recommend that this sub-Section should be re-incorporated in the newConstitution. *(e) &quot; Submarine cables, wireless telegraphy, wireless telephony, and. allother forms of communication connected with and ancillary to naval, military or aerial operations &quot;.The National Assembly wished to alter &quot; aerial &quot; to &quot;air force&quot; inconformity with their amendment of (c) above.I recommend, with the agreement of the Committee, that the original formshould be retained, t(f) &quot; Lands and buildings, docks, harbours and other waters, used or required for naval, military and other purposes connected with any reservedmatter (hereinafter referred to as &apos; Imperial property and interests &apos;) so longas they shall be used or, in the opinion of the Naval, Military or Air ForceAuthority, are required for such purposes &quot;.The objections of the National Assembly were centred upon the word&quot;required &quot; as distinct from &quot; used &quot;. They feared that the indefinitenessof the former word might lead in the future (as they considered it had inthe past) to arbitrary interpretation. I was able to remove a misapprehensionas to the meaning implicit in &quot; required &quot;, and I also referred to therecommendations which I had promised to make under (b) above in respectof compulsory acquisition and the payment of compensation. The Com-mittee were re-assured, and I recommend that sub-Section (f) be re-incorporated among the &quot; reserved matters &quot; in the new Constitution, withadditional1 provision (made necessary by the agreement referred to under (c)above), for the inclusion of the requirements of civil aviation.J(g) &quot; The Palaces and other buildings now in the official occupation of theGovernor, and such other lands, buildings and other property as may fromtime to time, be vested in the Governor for the use of the Maltese ImperialGovernment or in a Secretary of State or in any other person or personsjor Our use and disposition as Imperial property &quot;.The National Assembly had excised the words &quot; or in a Secretary of state or in any other person or persons for Our use and disposition as Imperialproperty &quot;, and had added the words &quot; with the consent of the Legislature &quot;M after the words &quot; the Governor &quot;. The justification offered for the excisionwas the redundancy and inapplicability of the words in question; that forthe addition was the need to ensure that proper account was taken of theinterests and views of the Maltese Government.During the discussion the Committee withdrew their objection to the words&quot;or in a Secretary of State &quot; but saw no useful purpose in the words&quot;or in any other person or persons &quot;. I expressed guarded agreement withtheir view of the words last quoted.I felt bound to disagree with the proposal regarding &quot; the consent of theLegislature &quot;. At the same time, I entirely accepted the view that full consideration should be given to Maltese interests and views in any questionarising under the terms of this sub-Section.
I recommend: (i) that the words &quot; or in any other person or persons &quot; should be omitted  ft&apos;-unless there is some specific intention requiring to be sustained behind theoriginal inclusion of these words.(ii) that means should be found to meet the Maltese view, eg., by re-quiring the Governor to consult the Ministry in all relevant cases and, in theevent of their dissent, to refer the matter to you for your decision.*(h) &quot; Trade with any place outside the Island except so far as trade mavbe affected by the enactment by the Legislature of laws imposing taxation orregulating or prohibiting exports and imports and the sale of imported goods-which laws shall, however, not be repugnant to the next succeeding paragraphor to the provisions of any Treaty entered into by Us or Our predecessorsor successors and extending to the Island &quot;.The National Assembly desired the excision of this sub-section on theground that it had tended to encourage interference on the part of theImperial authorities with trading operations by the Maltese which did notin fact conflict with any commercial agreements entered into by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. They in no way queried the principle expressed in Section41 (1) (P) regarding the force of any such commercial agreements.This sub-Section appears to me unnecessary so long as Section 41 (1) (p\is retained and I recommend its excision, f(i) &quot; The importation of goods or animals for the use of Our naval, military or air forces, and the imposition of customs or other duties thereon &quot;.No question was raised and I recommend this sub-Section be re-incorporated in the new Constitution-^(j) &quot; Coincoge and currency &quot;.The National Assembly proposed to add &quot; except that for local needs&quot;and it was explained that the only reason for the addition was to ensurethat the Note Security Fund, the interest on which forms a very important part of the revenue of the Maltese Government, should be continued.I explained to the Committee that it was inevitable that &quot; coinage andcurrency &quot; should be treated as a whole and reserved, and I added that,although, so far as I knew, no decision had yet been taken regarding the note Security Fund, I was authorised to give them an assurance that you would certainly press for a continuance of the existing arrangements. Onthis understanding they expressed their willingness to recommend the with-drawal of the qualification added by the National Assembly.I recommend that &quot; coinage and currency &quot; remain a &quot; reserved matter(k) &quot;Immigration&quot;.This also had been cut out by the National Assembly on the ground thatthe people of Malta should be able to refuse to accept any &quot; dumping &quot; of refugees on their Island. It was also pointed out that &quot; irnrnigration &quot; hadnot been reserved in the new Ceylon Constitution.While expressing some sympathy with the view taken about &quot; dumping &quot;,I said nor was any dissent evinced that the authority responsible for thedefence of the Island must retain the right to prohibit the entry of undesirablepersons.* Appendix IX (5) para. 5 (ii).f Appendix IX (5) para. 5 (iii).j Appendix IX (5) para. 5 (iv).5 Appendix IX (5) para. 5 (v).
I recommend that a distinction be drawn between the two aspects of the natter and that, while the Imperial Government should retain the right to prohibit the entry of any person or persons whom they regard as dangerousthey should debar themselves from using their control of immigration tofacilitate the entry of others whom they do not regard as dangerous. *(1) &quot; Naturalisation and aliens &quot;.The National Assembly had made no comment on this sub-Section but theCommittee suggested that some amplification and clarification of the meaningwas desirable.I recommend this suggestion toi your consideration, t(m) &quot;Postal and telegraphic censorship &quot;.Here again, the National Assembly had adopted the drastic method ofdeletion to emphasize their dislike of the wholesale method by which powers were retained without any qualification and without regard to the questionwhether security was affected or not.I recommend that &quot; Postal and Telegraphic Censorship &quot; remain a&quot; reserved matter &quot; but that a proviso should be included to ensure thatcensorship should not be imposed except for reasons of security.f This, I haveno doubt, would be entirely acceptable.(n) &quot; The issue and visa of passports &quot;.No question was raised and I recommend that this sub-Section be re-incor-porated in the new Constitution. 5(o) &quot; The appropriation of any such revenue as may accrue to Us inrespect of any &apos; reserved matter &apos; &quot;.The National Assembly had suggested the addition of the words &quot; as laiddown in Section 6o &quot; (i.e., of the National Assembly&apos;s draft, corresponding to Section 63 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent).The point appeared both to the Committee and myself to be one of draftingonly and without significance.il On other hand, it seems questionable whether any advantage really arises from the retention of this sub-Sectionat all. Under the regime of 1921-1933, I understand, all sums accruingin respect of &quot; reserved matters &quot;. were paid into the Consolidated RevenueFund by an annual Appropriation Ordinance, and any funds required forthe expenses of the Imperial side of the dyarchy were made available underthe terms of Section 63 of the Constitution. The effect of omitting this sub-Section would merely be that all such sums would automatically be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.I take the opportunity, moreover, to remark that as it stands, this sub-Section might be interpreted as justifying the Imperial authorities in appro-priating the whole of the interest, amounting to about  360,000 per annum,derived from the Note Security Fund, in view of the fact that &quot; coinage andcurrency &quot; is a &quot; reserved matter &apos;&apos;.(p) &quot; Treaties or any relations with Foreign States except so far as local legislation may be necessary to enable effect to be given within the Island toay Treaty entered into by Us or Our predecessors or successors and extend-retraining to the Island, &quot;.No question was raised and I recommend this sub-Section be re-incorporated in the new Constitution.^* Appendix IX (6) para. 4 (i).t Appendix IX (6) para. 4 (ii).J Appendix IX (6) para. 4 (iii).j Appendix IX (6) para. 4 (iv).II Appendix IX (6) para. 4 (v).j[ Appendix IX (6) para. 4 (vi).
(q) &quot; The appointment (including qualification and remuneration) of judge,of the superior courts and the tenure of office and removal of such judges&quot;Prior to the grant of the Constitution of 1921, judges were appointed by thsSovereign on the advice of the Secretary of State, but it was the invariablepractice that the latter consulted the Governor, and the Governor in turnconsulted the Chief Justice and the Crown Advocate.Under the Letters Patent of 1921 it was laid down that judges should b(appointed by the Governor-in-Council, that is to say, on the advice of the maltese Ministry, and should not be removed except by the Governor-in.Council on an address from both Houses in the same session made uponcertain specified grounds.The Royal Commission of 1931 recommended that the Letters Patent of1921 should be amended in the direction of the earlier practice and the appointment of judges made a &quot; reserved matter &quot;. This was effected by the malta constitution Act of July, 1932.The position is the same to-day under the provisions of the Malta letters patent of 1939 which provide that &apos;&apos; the Judges of Our Superior Courts of malta shall be appointed by the Governor in Our Name and on OurBehalf&quot;.The National Assembly of 1945-46 recommended, and the constitutional committee stoutly maintained, that the appointment of judges should in future be in the hands of the Governor in Council and that in this and all other essential respects there should be a reversion to the 1921 Constitution (asamended by the Governors Proclamation of the 15th September, 1921).I urged the very great importance of ensuring that there should be no ground for charges of political bias in the appointment of the Judiciary,As the late Chief Justice, Sir Michael Refalo, put the point when the grantof the 1921 Constitution was under discussion, &quot; With regard to the appoint-ment of judges, , it seems to me that the institution would gain in publicopinion as to the independence of the judges and the prestige and dignity oftheir office, if they continued to be appointed by His Majesty the King as heretofore, without interference from the Executive power.&quot; I also drewtheir attention to Section 52 of the Ceylon Constitution of 1946, under theterms of which judges are appointed by the Governor &quot; in his discretion,&quot;i.e. after asking the advice of the Prime Minister, and informed the Com-mittee that it was your view that similar provision ought to be made inthe new Malta Constitution.The Committee, on the other hand, emphasized that public opinion wasunanimous in regarding it as unseemly and derogatory that the Ministry ofthe day should not be trusted to advise the Governor aright in this matter,and that the Governor should not be bound to follow their advice. More-over, they held, were as likely to be made when the Governoracts &quot; in his discretion &quot; after having advice, as when he acts upon a formalrecommendation given with a fuller sense of responsibility.From this position the Committee refused to be moved.The force of the arguments adduced by the Committee is considerable,So strong and unanimous appear to be the wishes of the Maltese in this matterand so little conviction do I feel that a rigid insistence upon a contrary view would, on balance, lead to better results, that I am disposed to advise accept-ance of their wishes in respect of the appointment of judges.* The judgesthemselves, I would remark, are divided in opinion upon this point.* Appendix IX (7) para. 4 (ii).
But whether the judges are appointed by the Governor &quot; in his discretion &quot;or on the advice of the Maltese Ministry, I recommend that &quot;Judges &quot; shouldbe removed from the &quot; reserved matters &quot; enumerated in Section 41 (1) ofthe 1921 Constitution and dealt with wholly under a revised Section 55(&quot; Judges appointment, tenure and remuneration &quot;). It would, at the samerime, be necessary to provide for the inclusion of &quot; Judges &quot; among the&quot; special &quot; subjects upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government only can amend the Constitution, (&quot; Religious Toleration,&apos;5 &quot; Language,&quot; &quot; The Reserved civil list &quot;), and which form the subject of the following chapter.In order to safeguard the rights of existing judges and their successors,the recommendations of the National Assembly contained in sub-Sections (1),(3) and (5) of Section 52 of their draft will require adjustment to bring them into line with the corresponding sub-Sections of Section 55 of the 1921 Con-stitution as amended by paragraph 5 of the Governors Proclamation of the15th September, 1921. Sub-Sections (2) and (4) of the National Assembly&apos;draft are repeated from the Malta Constitution Letters Patent of 1932 and do not appear to require any change.(r) &quot; The establishment, discipline, control and administration of thepolice &quot;.*As stated above, the Royal Commission of 1931 considered that &quot; the treat-ment of the force has been too frequently influenced by party considerations,&quot;but they stopped short of recommending that the police should at once beincluded among the &quot; reserved matters.&quot;Powers were taken, however, by the Malta Constitution Act of 1932 toenable this to be done, and in September, 1933, two months before thesecond suspension of the Constitution, the control of the police was removed from the local to the imperial sphere. ,The Maltese now press for a return to the position of 1921, nor is iteasy to regard self-government in internal affairs as having any reality if itdoes not include control of their own police force. Moreover, it seems very doubtful whether, if the control of the Maltese police were nominally vested in the hands of the Imperial Government, this would in effect bring with itany benefits likely to counter-balance the inevitable evils of recurrent friction between the two sides of the dyarchy.I recommend that the control of the police force should not be included among the &quot; reserved matters &quot; in the new Constitution.!CHAPTER 8.&quot; Special &quot; Matters.Under the terms of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, distinctionswere drawn between three groups of subjects in respect of the powers exercis-able by the Government of Malta.(a) In the case of &apos;&apos; reserved matters &apos;&apos; the Government of Malta couldneither amend the Constitution a power retained by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment nor could they legislate a power retained by the MalteseImperial Government;(6) In the case of a certain &quot; special &quot; group now to be considered theyhad powers, limited by the terms of the Constitution itself, to legislate,but no power to amend the Constitution;(c) In all other cases they could amend the Constitution and legislateat will.* The Malta Constitution (Amendment) Letters Patent, 1933.f Appendix IX (7) para. 4 (i).
The &quot; special&quot; group referred to under (o) comprised &quot; Religious Tolera-tion &quot;, &quot; Language &quot; and &quot; The Reserved Civil List &quot;, all subjects callingifor special safeguards&quot;&quot; in view of their potentialities for trouble and the responsibilities falling upon His Majesty&apos;s Government. These will now betaken in turn (A) religious toleration.The Constitution of 1921 provided that &quot; (1) all persons in Malta shall have full liberty of conscience and thefree exercise of their respective modes of religious worship;   -(2) no person shall be subjected to any disability, or excluded fromholding any office by reason of his religious profession.&quot;This Section is repeated in the present Constitution, i.e. in the Malta letters patent, 1939.The National Assembly desired to preface these words by a sub-Sectionreading &quot; the Religion of Malta is the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith &quot;,and also to add at the end of the Section the words &quot; But persons who donot profess the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith may be precluded fromholding any office connected with public instruction and education.&quot;Behind these proposals lies the story of a long and heated controversy.When the terms of the 1921 Constitution were originally under discussion,the Church authorities of Malta had pressed for a similar confession of faithas preface to Section 56, but His Majesty&apos;s Government had felt bound to resist it on the ground that the request of the National Assembly was basedon a misunderstanding of the nature of the legal instruments in which a constitution is embodied. These instruments are concerned only with the framework of the system of government and, in the case of Malta, the delimitation of the sphere of authority of the local legislature and executive.A general declaration such as had been suggested would, it was held, be outof place in such a document, and all the more so in this case because i[would deal with a matter which, under its provisions, was left entirely withinthe competence of the people of Malta and of their elected representatives. all matters which pertain to the safeguarding of their religious institutions and themaintenance of their faith were left in their hands, subject only to the con-dition, which would never, of course, be opposed, that those who are notRoman Catholics should not suffer any interference in the free exercise oftheir own faith or be prejudiced in any public career.The difficulty was met in 1921 by omitting the credo from the Constitutionitself but raising no objection to the passage through the local Legislature ofa Religion of Malta Declaration Act, 1922. This received the King&apos;s consenton the 4th March, 1922, and stated in formal terms that &quot; The Roman CatholicApostolic Religion is, as it has ever been in the past, the Religion of malta and its Dependencies &quot;.  The Act (No. 1 of 1922) is still in operation.I explained to the Constitutional Committee that I fully understood theirmotives, but at the same time, felt bound to explain the attitude of His BMajesty&apos;s Government as expressed above, which must necessarily be main-tained. There, by general assent, the matter was amicably left.The second amendment, relating to education, is not, it is true, in mandatoryform, but I pointed out that it would empower the Ministry, if so disposed, toban, e.g. public instruction in Church of England Schools and to restrict the educational facilities provided by the Services in Malta.  The Committee, for* In the discussions between the Constitutional Committee of the National assembly and myself, we found it convenient to refer to them as the &quot; Preserved Matters &quot;. I couldalmost advocate adoption of that phrase for the sake of simplicity.
(C) the reserved civil list.Section 63 (1) of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, which wasamended in 1927,$ provided that there should be a Reserved Civil List, thedetails of which were set out in Schedule &quot;A&quot; to the Letters Patent, andthat the Governor could by message to the Legislative Assembly appropriateout of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Malta any additional sums requiredfor defraying other expenses arising out of the &apos;&apos; reserved matters &apos;&apos;.* Appendix IX (8) para. 4 (iv).t Appendix IX (8) para. 4 (hi).j The Malta Constitution (Amendment) Letters Patent, 1927.33242 B 2their part, disclaimed any intention to do anything of the kind in practice,explaining that they had intended only to cover the case of schools maintained by and under the control of the Government of Malta. In expressing myappreciation of this clarification of their intentions, I felt bound to point outthat the Government of Malta could give adequate effect to them by administra-tive means, without specific provision being made in the Constitution. here again by general consent, the matter was amicably left.I can only recommend that the wording of- Section 56 of the Constitution of1921 be retained.*(B) language.The problem of &quot; Language &quot;, in the days which now seem so distant,when the Constitution of 1921 was being prepared, was volcanic in its mani-festations. Many natural bonds, religious and cultural, had for long linkedMalta with Italy, and in time a factor more artificial but equally potent,that of politics, had been superimposed. Politics played an ever increasingpart in the period between the two great wars. By 1930 (see Chapter 2of this Report) the volcano was already in eruption and the language question was one of the chief forms in which it manifested itself. With the entry of Italy into the war of 1939-45 and the bombing of Malta, the dispute regard-ing the claims of Italian as an official language suffered a violent eclipse.Thus none of the ancient heat was engendered when the National Assemblycame to consider the once contentious language clauses (Sections 40 and 57)of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent of 1932, as amended by the letters patent of 16th August, 1934, and the only principle which the national assembly had desired by a series of drafting amendments to establish wasthat all public business should be conducted in both English and Maltese.It was conceded, however, that it was impracticable to give effect to all thelogical corollaries of this, e.g. that all speeches made in the Legislature shouldbe translated and recorded in English.I recommend:  (a) that English and Maltese should be recognised as official languages andthat public documents and notices of public importance issued by the Gov-ernment of Malta should be in those languages;!(b) that all journals, entries, minutes and proceedings (excepting the text of speeches made in Maltese) of either House should be recorded in bothlanguages; f(c) as regards the language of the Courts and of public instruction, there appears to be no change of moment involved in the proposals contained in theNational Assembly&apos;s draft and I recommend they be accepted in principle, f
CHAPTER 9.The method of granting the Constitution and the Reservation of Power to revoke, alter or amend its Provisions.:];The question whether the Constitution of Malta should be granted by act of Parliament or by Prerogative Instrument (Letters Patent or Order inCouncil) has been raised on several occasions in the past, and the reply ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government has on each occasion been in favour of the Preroga-tive Instrument.In 1919 the National Assembly expressed the wish that&quot; An Act of the British Parliament shall guarantee the Constitution,which shall not be revoked or modified except by another Act of Parlia-ment.&quot;The same, in effect, was the contention of the National Assembly of 1946,though it became clear during our discussions that less weight was attachedto the method of granting the new Constitution than to the importance ofenduing it from the outset with stability by providing that no amendmentsshould be possible without prior opportunities for debate in the imperial parliament and, a fortiori, no suspension or revocation. While sympathisingwith the desire to achieve stability, as much in the interests of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as of Malta, I was at pains to make it clear to the constitutional committee that there was no likelihood whatever of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment consenting to the method proposed and that I should be entirely unableto recommend it, for the following reasons:  (a) Parliamentary business in England, is normally in a state of con-gestion and the process of passing an Act of Parliament must neces-sarily entail inordinate delays, even in the case of matters of importance,however strong the case for rapid action. This, in effect, was the argu-ment used by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1919and 1920, and it is probably more cogent to-day even than it was atthat time;* Appendix IX (8) para. 4 (v).t Appendix IX (7) para. 4 (ii).j Appendix IX (4) paras. 4 and 5 ; Appendix IX (7) para. 4 (iii) and Appendix IX (10)para. 4 (ix).The view taken&apos;by the National Assembly was that the 1921 Constitution&apos;^was unobjectionable in so far as it provided for a Reserved Civil List, butthey represented that it was only fair that when the Governor wished to appropriate &quot; other sums &quot;, i.e. additional sums, for defraying the expensesof the Maltese Imperial Government, he should first have to obtain theconsent of the Maltese Legislature which was responsible for providing themoney.I regard this as a reasonable request and recommend that it should beacceded to.*When the question of &quot; Judges &quot; was being considered, the Committeeasked that the Reserved Civil List should be so drawn up as to make clear the number of judges provided for, and the salaries these appointmentsshould carry, tI recommend that the various matters covered by. the Reserved Civil list should be set out with greater particularity.
14?(6) There are great practical disadvantages in the course advocated bythe Maltese on account of the element of undesirable rigidity which wouldbe imported. &quot; Stability &quot; is not an absolute virtue unless perfectioncan be first postulated; elasticity is also a desideratum. Nor is this argument one by which His Majesty&apos;s Government alone should be moved;if all goes well, circumstances may arise in which an amendment ofthe Constitution, having in view the grant of some additional powerto the local Legislature, is regarded with equal favour at home and in malta. If the passing of an Act of Parliament is a pre-requisite, suchconcession will inevitably be subject to long delay, nor can it be assumed that the result would necessarily be the grant of more rather than less;(c) It is impossible, and would be illogical, to disregard the relevanceof precedent, since it may be assumed that the processes followed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the constitutional development of its colonial empire were not adopted without some good reason, and experiencederived from similar cases is not negligible in value. If, for instance, onesurveys the whole field in which Legislative Councils have been constitutedat one time or another, one finds* that there are thirteen legislative bodiesconstituted by Order in Council, three (including Malta) by Letters Patent,eight by Royal Instructions, eight by local Ordinance, and only one(the Leeward Island, in which case, for juristic reasons, there was no practical alternative) by Act of Parliament. In the most recent case.ofall, that of Ceylon, the Constitution has been granted by Order in Council.Before proceeding further I venture to emphasise the need to discriminate between revocation, suspension and amendment. To revoke a Constitutionmeans to rescind and cancel it, the most drastic of all steps when self-govern-ment has once been granted, and taken once only in Malta, that is in August,1936,f by Letters Patent. A Constitution revoked cannot be revived. Anew constitution must be granted to replace it. The suspension of a Con-stitution is a temporary process of less definitive type. To quote again thewords used on the first occasion when the Constitution of Malta was suspended:&quot; The effect will be to place as an emergency measure the full legislative and executive authority in the hands of the Governor. The existing Minis-try will, however, be retained in office and will be available in a consultative,capacity in so far as the Governor chooses to make use of their services.&quot;tTo amend a Constitution does not necessarily imply more than an alteration in one or more of its provisions. The attitude of the National Assembly, as already stated, is that an Act of Parliament should be necessary for any oneof these three very different operations. This is really the statement of amaximum claim, without regard to the strength of the case for acceptingsomething less.The objections felt by the National Assembly to the Malta ConstitutionLetters Patent of 1921 and, still more, of course, to any suggestion of strengthen-ing the powers of His Majesty&apos;s Government to amend the Constitution,centred largely upon Section 68 and the use made of it in 1930 to extend the scope of Section 41 (1).I pointed out to the Committee that it would be quite impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to consent to any diminution of the powers contained inSection 68, and the issue seemed to me to be between alternative methods of retaining them.   The Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946, as they* See Martin Wight, &quot;The Development of the Legislative Council, 1606-1945&quot;,Faber &amp; Faber, 1946 (Appendix 10).t See Chapter 2 of this Report.53242 B3
were aware, contained a clause (Section 30 (4)) which read &quot; His Majestyhereby reserves to Himself, His Heirs and Successors power, with the advice of His or Their Privy Council, to revoke, add to, suspend or amend this order, or any part thereof, as to Him or Them shall seem fit&quot;. If thismodel were followed, a wide and general power would be retained and thiswould render unnecessary the alternative course of re-adopting indirectmethods. The second alternative seemed undesirable as tending to encouragecontinual legalistic argumentation of the kind which has been so unfortunatelyprevalent in the past. Moreover, it was the use to which Section 68 had beenput in 1930, i.e., the extension of.the scope of Section 41 (1) to cover afar wider field than had been originally intended, and in effect to suspend theConstitution, which had been the subject of particularly bitter recrimination.His Majesty&apos;s Government being, as I had previously explained, unable to accede to the National Assembly&apos;s request for Act of Parliament procedure in substitution for prerogative procedure, the choice between the two alter-natives, the direct or the indirect, remained open. I hoped that the Com-mittee would consent to endorse a recommendation for acceptance of thefirst.The Committee replied that they were quite unable to do so. The National iAssembly desired that any revocation, suspension or amendment of the Con- Istitution should be by Act of Parliament, and by Act of Parliament alone. IIf for reasons over which they had no control this was denied to them, they Iwould regard the re-inclusion .of the section similar to Section 68 as preferable ;to an overriding clause such as had been incorporated in the Ceylon Constitu- Ition. Section 68 had at least the merits of restricting the power of His IMajesty&apos;s Government to amend the Constitution by prerogative legislation Ito a limited number of matters, and also of making it impossible for the IConstitution to be revoked except by Act of Parliament. The maintenance Iof this position was treated as fundamental and as a matter of honour. So Iperforce matters were left.In making my recommendations upon this difficult matter I feel some Idiffidence.   It would not in any case lie within my province to advise upon Ithe choice of the Instrument by which His Majesty&apos;s Government restores self- 1government to Malta, and you have made clear to me that an Act of Parlia- Iment is ruled out: on the other hand questions have been raised regarding 1revocation, suspension and amendment, and my instructions cover the wholewide field of the issues arising in connection with Section 68 of the 1921 Con-stitution and the powers to be retained thereunder.   Since it is impossibleentirely to separate the question of the means employed for the initial grantof the Constitution from that of the means employed for its subsequent revoca-tion, suspension or amendment, I take it that I may be excused if I placeupon record such views as I have formed upon the subject as a whole.The first point which, I would make is that not only is the grant of thenew Constitution by Act of Parliament out of the question, but this wouldnot in itself satisfy the Maltese if there was any provision permitting of itsrevocation, suspension or amendment, e.g. by Letters Patent. The questionremaining, therefore, is whether, the Constitution having been granted byLetters Patent, powers should be preserved, and if so to what extent, to revoke, suspend or amend it by further Letters Patent without recourse toParliament.Certain practical considerations the delays involved and the disadvantages of undue rigidity have already been referred to; moreover it is logical to. contend that the authority which grants a Constitution must have power to alter it.   But other factors have also to be taken into account.   Were anentirely new Constitution being framed, as in 1921, with a slate clean of all
promises or commitments, I should have no hesitation in advocating the clear and definite wording of Section 30(4) of the Ceylon Constitution as quoted above. Unfortunately, perhaps, conditions are otherwise: a Constitution hasbeen promised to Malta in the same sphere as that enjoyed between 1921 and1933*&apos; and there can be no doubt that great resentment, coupled with charges of ill-faith, would arise if the powers taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government were greater and the freedom granted to the people of Malta less than those ofi92I-33-On the other hand, so vital to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the peopleof Malta alike is the need to safeguard Imperial interests, and so closelyintertwined are those interests with the general welfare of the Island, that powers must obviously be retained in some way or another to enable HisMajesty&apos;s Government efficiently and promptly to fulfil their responsibilities in both respects.- The vital principle must be kept in mind that responsibilities and powers are coterminous. It is unquestionable that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are responsible, not only for the defence of Malta, but for its welfareas a Colony of the Empire. The fact is, indeed, implicitly recognised in everydemand of the Maltese for assistance from the United Kingdom, and it derivesa peculiar potency from the absence of those natural resources which, whendeveloped, may enable other colonies to pay their way. In a sense, indeed,&quot; self-government &quot;, literal and unqualified, as applied to the case of Malta,involves a contradiction in terms, since no absolutely hard and fast line of demarcation is possible between internal and external affairs.I suggest that a reasonable compromise is by no means impossible betweenthe two discrepant viewpoints, and the following recommendations are directed to that end:  (a) I recommend that, the new Constitution having been initially granted by Letters Patent or Order in Council (as may be decided) no power shouldbe reserved to revoke the Constitution by Prerogative Instrument. This re-establishes the position as it was between 1921 and 1933, and indeed until1936 when an Act of Parliament (The Malta (Letters Patent) Act, 1936)restored to the Crown the power to revoke by Letters Patent of which it haddivested itself in enacting the Constitution of 1921.(b) But, since it would be entirely unsafe so to leave matters that, in theevent of an emergency arising which called for prompt and speedy action onthe part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, such action could not be taken withoutthe delays attendant upon the passing of an Act of Parliament, I recommendthat provision should be made in the Constitution similar to that contained ina Section, other than that quoted above, of the Ceylon Constitution of 1946,namely, Section 30(1)(a). In this, power is taken by the Crown to make such-laws as may appear necessary for the defence of the Island &quot; or for securingand maintaining public safety and order and supplies and services in case ofpublic emergency.&quot; Further provision would no; doubt be made to ensure thatthe powers vested in the Maltese Legislature by Section 41(6) of the Consti-tution of 1921 were not utilised by them to repeal or alter these laws. Nowholesale suspension of the Constitution is necessarily implied, and to this extent the views of the Maltese are met, so far as they reasonably can be, whilesufficient powers are left to His Majesty&apos;s Government for use in greater orless degree according to the immediate needs of the situation.(c) I recommend that Section 68 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent,which reserved power to revoke, alter or amend certain Sections of the Con-stitution by Prerogative Instrument, namely those relating to &quot; reserved matters &quot; and the &quot; special &quot; group of subjects (&quot; Religious Toleration,&quot;* See Chapter 1 oi this Report.
* Appendix IX (10) para. 4 (viii).&quot; Language,&quot; etc.), should be reworded in the new Constitution in such a way as to permit of amendments by the same method within the field prescribedwhile precluding any such apparent straining of interpretations as occcurredwhen this Section was invoked in 1930 to legitimise what was in effect a suspension of the Constitution.A further point touching the power to amend the Constitution arose:  Section 67 of &quot; The Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921,&quot; permitted theGovernor, with the prior approval of the Crown, to make amendments to themwithin the space of one year &quot; in order to carry out the purposes of the same,&quot;and to &quot; provide for any other matters necessary in order to carry into effect the provisions thereof.&quot; The National Assembly had incorporated no similar provision in their draft of the new Constitution, having failed, as the Com-mittee frankly explained, to realise either the strictly limited scope of this power of amendment or its usefulness, which latter was exemplified in 1921by, the passing of certain minor consequential amendments desired by the maltese themselves.I recommend the re-inclusion of a similar Section in the new Constitution^CHAPTER 10.Disallowance and Reservation of Laws.Section 47 of the 1921 Constitution permits the disallowance of any lawwithin one year of the Governors assent thereto.The Committee made clear that the National Assembly in proposing the deletion of this Section were moved by no other motives than to achievesimplification and prevent any likelihood of friction. The Governor, as repre-sentative of His Majesty, has full power under the succeeding Section 48to reserve a law passed by the Legislature for the signification of His Majesty&apos;pleasure, and the exercise of a power of disallowance after that assenthad been given and the law had been in operation for many months mightwell lead not only to administrative dislocation but to considerable popularresentment.Clearly there is substance in these arguments, but I argued that they mustbe considered, not in isolation, but in conjunction with other arguments arisingout of the various rights and duties vested in the Governor in the matter of&quot; reserving &quot; laws. Under Section 48 of the 1921 Constitution, the GovernorMAY reserve any law passed by the Legislature without exception andSHALL so reserve certain specified categories of laws, viz. (broadly speaking) any of which are discriminatory against non-Maltese, or whichencroach upon &quot; reserved matters,&quot; or which have the effect of altering theConstitution. The National Assembly had proposed the deletion of thesemandatory powers in all cases except that of laws discriminatory againstnon-Maltese. This, if accepted, would not, of course, alter in any way thepermissive powers contained in Section 48, and I expressed to the Committeethe view that if the Governor had a permissive power it was always opento you to make it mandatory in respect of any particular subject. Not only,in my view, should the Governor be bound to reserve those special cate-gories of law which are referred to in Section 48, but also any law which affected the special group of subjects including &quot; Religious Toleration,&quot;&quot; Language,&quot; &quot; Judges &quot; and the &quot; Reserved Civil List.&quot;To this proposition the Committee fully assented, and indeed they appearedto regard it as self-evident.
I feel justified, therefore, in recommending: (a) that consideration be given to the practicability of omitting the powersof disallowance provided in Section 47*;(b) that the mandatory injunction contained in Section 48 be extended tocover any legislation relating to the special group of subjects including&quot; Religious Toleration,&quot; &quot; Language,&quot; &quot; Judges,&quot; and the &quot; Reserved civil list &quot;*;(c) I also invite your attention to die point made by the Committee thatsub-Section (b) of Section 48 (referring to laws which encroach upon &quot; reserved matters &quot;) appears merely to repeat what has already been provided in Section41 (3), (4) and (5), and to recommend that the point be considered in drafting the new Constitution^A further point arose incidentally to these questions of the disallowance andreservation of laws. Section 49 of the 1921 Constitution specifies one year asthe period allowed for the signification of the Royal Assent to a Bill reservedby the Governor, failing which it lapses. The National Assembly proposed thesubstitution of six months, being under the impression that the result wouldbe a speeding up of departmental decisions. They had overlooked the danger that the result might equally be the lapsing of more Bills. It was also pointedout to them that, other considerations apart, there was no precedent for soshort, a period as six months, that two years was more normal, and that in thenew Ceylon Constitution no time limit is fixed at all. After some discussion,opinion veered in favour of the Ceylon practice on the ground that any speci-fic period mentioned might tend to be regarded as a minimum rather than amaximum.I recommend that no fixed period be laid down in the Section of the newConstitution corresponding to Section 49 of the 1921 Constitution for the signification of the King&apos;s pleasure on Bills reserved, fCHAPTER 11.Miscellaneous Provisions relating to the Powers of the Governor.There were in the Constitution of 1921 certain provisions of comparatively minor importance which related to the powers of the Governor vis-a-vis the maltese Legislature and Ministry and which the National Assembly hadqueried. It will be convenient to follow the procedure adopted in my dis-cussions with the Constitutional Committee and group these together in thisReport.(a) The Governor&apos;s power to assent to laws.By a suggested amendment to Section 44 (c) the Governor would have losthis discretionary power to grant or withhold his assent to laws presented tohim by the Legislature, or to reserve them, although in fact Section 48, whichhad in this respect been accepted by the National Assembly, left this dis-cretionary power in his hands. The anomaly was, in fact, only due to a misunderstanding, and it was agreed and I recommend that the position inthe new Constitution should be as it was in the 1921 Constitution. $(b) The Governor&apos;s power to transmit Bills to the Legislature.Section 29 of the 1921 Constitution allows the Governor to transmit draftBills to the Legislature for their consideration.   The National Assembly had* Appendix IX (9) para. 4 (i).t Appendix IX (9) para. 4 (ii).J Appendix IX (9) para. 4 (iii).
suggested that this section be deleted oh the ground that the procedureenvisaged was more likely to lead to friction between the two sides of thedyarchy than to serve any useful or effective purpose. With this view I agree,and I recommend that the Section in question be omitted from the newConstitution^(c) The Governor&apos;s confirmation of the election of Officers of the Legislature.The election of the President and the Vice-President of the Senate andof the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly were made subject to confirmation by the Governor in the Constitution of 1921(Sections 9 (1) and 16 (1) respectively). The National Assembly had deletedthese provisions in their draft and the Committee expressed the view thatit would be wrong in principle and impossible in practice for the governor to decline to confirm such elections; nor, it was pointed out, was any such provision included in the Ceylon Constitution. I recommend the omissionfrom the new Constitution of the condition that the Governor^ confirmation of the election of officers of either Chamber should be a pre-requisite of theirappointment, f(d) Relations between the Governor and the Ministry and between theGovernor and the Legislature.Section 54 (5) of the 1921 Constitution lays down that &quot; The Head of theMinistry shall be the official channel of communication between the governor and the Ministry and the relations between the Governor and the Ministry and between the Governor and the Legislature, and between the Ministry and theLegislature, shall . . . be regulated as nearly as possible by the constitutional practice obtaining in like matters in Our United Kingdom &quot;. Two pointsarise. In the first place, I take it as axiomatic that to legislate by way ofreference to undefined procedure prevailing elsewhere is unsatisfactory. Thisview was shared by the Committee, although in fact the National Assemblyhad suggested no change in this respect from the wording of 1921.I recommend: (i) that in the new Constitution there should be no reference to &quot; the Con-stitutional practice obtaining in like matters in Our United Kingdom &quot;. Itmay be desirable to ensure conformity between Constitutional practice in theUnited Kingdom and Malta, but this would surely be done best, so far asaffects the actions of the Governor, by administrative instructions;;!:(ii) that the corresponding Section in the new Constitution be confined tostating that the Head of the Ministry is the official channel of communication between the Governor and the Ministry. The internal relations between the maltese Legislature and the Maltese Ministry would be presumably coveredby the current Laws of Procedure. J(e) The appointment of Ministers.Section 54 (1) of the Constitution of 1921 providing for the appointmentof Ministers by the Governor, specified a list of Departments from the Headsof which the Ministers should be chosen. The National Assembly had inall substantial respects followed this model in their proposals for a newConstitution. Subsequently, however, the Ceylon Constitution of 1946 had come to notice, in Section 46 of which it is provided that the Prime minister shall be appointed by the Governor and the rest of the Ministers by theGovernor acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.   This, in the* Appendix IX (9) para. 4 (iv).f Appendix IX (9) para. 4 (v).I Appendix IX (9) para. 4 (vi).
view of the Committee, formed a better model than the Constitution of 1921.I promised to bring the suggestion to your notice.The National Assembly had recommended in their draft that the numberof Ministers should not exceed eight (vice seven in the Constitution of 1921).I recommend acceptance of a maximum of eight Ministers, but think (as did the Committee also) that there is nothing to be gained from repeating in thenew Constitution an enumeration of the Departments to be entrusted to Ministers,provided that it is laid down (as in Ceylon) that the Departments of justice and Finance must be included in the Ministry.&quot;chapter 12.Relations of the Government of Malta with His Majesty&apos;s Government.(A) Malta and the Dominions Office.The National Assembly expressed the desire that the responsibility for the affairs of Malta should be transferred from the Colonial Office to the dominions office, and cited in support the case of Southern Rhodesia. I pointed out to the Constitutional Committee that this proposal could not be accepted; atthe same time I should, perhaps, add some explanation of what, in my view,the Maltese representatives have particularly in mind. This is not dominion status, for it is realised that a dyarchy and dominion status are incompa tible.They assume, rather, that the Dominions Office must, ex officio so to speak,avoid any possible imputation of addressing its clientele de haut en bas, andtheir plea, in effect, js for elasticity and even some degree of deference to be shown in dealing with the affairs of Malta. Malta, they contend, may be a colony, but it is not politically backward in the sense that many of the coloniesare, and the susceptibilities of the Maltese call for all the care and courtesynormally accorded to a nation of European stock.The recommendations which I have ventured to make at various stages ofthis Report are directed in no small degree to a removal of any sense of griev-ance based on such grounds.(B) Direct Access of Maltese Ministers to ministers in the United Kingdom.At a meeting of the National Assembly held on 7th June, 1945, the leader of the Labour Party and of the elected members of the Council of Govern-ment, Dr. Boffa, moved a motion that Maltese Ministers &quot; should have theright of direct access to Ministers in Britain &quot;. He realised there might be difficulties but regarded it as essential that some formula be found to permit of this.   The motion was duly seconded and passed nem. con.Much was made of the same point when I interviewed representatives ofthe Executive Committee of the Malta Labour Party on 25th July, 1946; itwas also raised by the Constitutional Committee on behalf of the national assembly, fIn its general aspect, this request is cognate to the demand that the newConstitution should be granted by an Act of Parliament and only revokedor amended in like manner, and it has behind it the desire, repeatedly notice-able throughout our discussions, to obtain fuller opportunities for the ventilation-tion of Maltese grievances as and when they may arise. More particularly, it relates to the fact that the economic life of the Island depends largely uponthe Service Departments, the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry,* Appendix ix (9) para. 4 (vii).I See Appen,dix ix (10) para. 4 (x).
to which the Maltese Ministers have no means of direct access. True, thereare representatives of the Service Departments in Malta, but these are bound by instructions from London; true, also, the Colonial Office acts as a mediumbetween Malta and the Service Departments in the United Kingdom, but theLabour element feel that they would get a better hearing and more resultsif they had the chance of themselves representing their case in such vitalmatters as/for example, that of employment in the dockyard.It had only to be pointed out to them that their proposal in the form sub-mitted was entirely contrary to accepted procedure and could not be entertainedand, moreover, that its adoption would in practice be likely to yield lessfruitful results than the normal method of approach, for them to admit that,as crudely worded, it was not worth pressing. But the desire remained, and isnot in itself unreasonable, that some machinery should be devised whereby the maltese should be enabled from time to time to state a case and argue it withthose in whose hands lies the penultimate, if not the ultimate, decision. I drew attention to the machinery already provided under the Constitution of 1921 inthe form of the Privy Council of Malta a body composed of the ExecutiveCouncil (the Governor sitting with the Ministers) and the Nominated Council(the Governor sitting, with the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legal Adviser and representatives of the three Services), in joint session,* which was presumablyintended to afford opportunities for the discussion of the kind of matters in mind,but the view taken was that meetings of the Privy Council could not beregarded, in the light of past experience, as affording sufficient guarantees for anything but disappointment and frustration, nor did the setting up ofany local machinery meet the case. It is relevant to note that there is onlyone recorded case of the Privy Council of Malta meeting, namely in 1930,and that its convocation, under the terms of the Constitution, lay entirely in the discretion of the Governor.Apart from what might be done in Malta to provide more opportunities for collaborative effort, I suggested, purely as a ballon d&apos;essai, the possibilityof. a joint committee being constituted in London to which important mattersof the kind described might from time to time be referred for discussion between representatives of the Colonial Office and the Services. The ideamet with immediate favour, but chiefly as a prelude to the further assumptionthat Maltese Ministers could claim a right to appear before the joint com-mittee, either in person or by chosen representatives a point on whichopinions differed.In offering, with all diffidence, my suggestions in regard to this matter of&quot; direct access &quot;, I assume that any representations which the Maltese Ministrymay wish to make to His Majesty&apos;s Government can only be made properlythrough the King&apos;s representative in Malta to yourself. None the less, I feelthat something can be done to meet the wishes of the Maltese. In the firstplace, more use might be made of the Privy Council of Malta, though itwould certainly be advisable to leave its convocation entirely within the governors discretion in order to prevent its being given a &quot; nuisance value &quot;.By this means, it should be possible to settle on the spot a proportion of thevexed questions arising between the Maltese and the Service Departments and,if no settlement is possible, at least to define the issues requiring the attentionof His Majesty&apos;s Government.In the second place, were you disposed to consider the formation in london of any departmental joint committee for Malta, similar to that which, Ibelieve, exists for Palestine, there would not appear to be any derogation- from local authority if a Maltese Minister were, upon occasion, invited to attend it.* See Chapter.2.
Such a course would at least help to remove the impression, fallacious but unfortunately current in Malta, that it is . impossible to get the ear of theauthorities in London without organising some form of local outbreak: itwould also be of positive value in that information would be exchanged,difficulties realised and misunderstandings removed.CHAPTER 13.Public Officers.Section 64 of the Constitution of 1921 provided that the appointment to, andremoval from, all public offices under the Maltese Government, except thoseof Ministers, should be vested in the Governor in Council, subject to certainprovisos. Section 65 afforded safeguards in respect of their rights to pensionsand gratuities.   The National Assembly proposed no change in either Section.Since, however, there is at present in being, under the Constitution of 1939,a Public Services Commission, and since I had received an application foran interview from representatives of the Malta Civil Service Association, Iraised with the Constitutional Committee the question whether provision shouldnot be made for the continuation of such a Commission under the new dis-pensation. They were definite in their rejection of the idea on the ground thatthe Governor in Council,. i.e., the Governor acting by and with the advice ofthe Executive Council, was the proper authority for this purpose and that theMinisters were better qualified to exercise the responsibility of advising himwithout partiality than any permanent or semi-permanent and irresponsiblebody which might be selected for the purpose. As in the case of Judges(Chapter 7, B. (q)) the dignity of the Ministry was felt to be at stake in thismatter. The Committee engaged, however, to refer the matter to the national assembly when reporting upon their discussions with me.On the following day I interviewed representatives of the Malta Civil ServiceAssociation and it transpired that they also, while naturally insistent upon theretention of full safeguards concerning their salaries, pension rights and con-discontinuity of service, only favoured a Public Services Commission provided theright of membership was formally conceded to a representative of their Associa-tion.The Public Services Commission, which is appointed by the Governor, con-desists at present of the Legal Secretary (Chairman), the Treasurer, the Secre-tary to Government and two Heads of Departments. To include a memberof the Civil Service Association itself seems to me to conflict with the conception of impartial authority underlying the formation of a Public Services Com-missibn, but the Association did not see matters in this light. They also pointedout with some truth as it seemed to me that in so small an island whereeveryone knew every detail about everyone else, complete impartiality wasunattainable in any conceivable circumstances, and the advice given by ministers who would be animated by a sense of responsibility and accountability wouldin the long run be more likely to give equitable results than would the judgment of a body of persons whose sense of responsibility would be no greater and whose accountability would be less.The National Assembly, at their meeting of the 13th September, endorsed theattitude of the Constitutional Committee.It appears to me that die decision in this matter should rest with the maltese themselves, and that it would be a mistake to allow analogies drawn from elsewhere to outweigh the considerations which they urge. In theUnited Kingdom it is no doubt easy to select a body of men who, in the first
place, are utterly unbiased and impartial in outlook and to whom, in thesecond place, not one in a million of the Civil Servants of the Crown is knownpersonally and intimately. In Malta the latter condition being in the natureof things impossible, it must follow that the former is automatically renderedless easy of attainment. 1 recommend, therefore, that Sections 64 and 65 ofthe Constitution of 1921 be re-incorporated in the new Constitution to begranted.CHAPTER 14.The Imperial Side of the Dyarchy.The Malta Constitution Letters Patent, 1921, were accompanied by twocompanion documents of the same date, namely the Letters Patent constitutingthe Office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief and the Royal Instructions.Passing references to these have been made from time to time in the courseof this Report, but the National Assembly and the Constitutional Committeehad, with great propriety, abstained from calling them into question or offeringany criticism upon them. .One point, however, which arises in this connection and upon which you have asked for my advice, concerns the post of Lieutenant-Governor, which takes its warrant from Section 4 of the Letters Patent constituting the Officeof Governor and Commander-in-Chief. This reads: &apos;&apos; There shall be aLieutenant-Governor in and over the Island, and appointments to the saidoffice shall be made by Commission under Our Sign Manual and Signet.The Lieutenant-Governor shall do and execute during Our pleasure allthings belonging to his office according to such Instructions as may from timeto time be given to him by Us, under Our Sign Manual and Signet, or throughone of Our Principal Secretaries of State.&quot;You have asked me to consider whether the Lieutenant-Governorship ought,under the new dispensation, to be retained in its present form or replaced bya post of lesser status carrying some such title as &quot; Chief Secretary &quot;.The appointment has behind it a long and interesting history, from whichit is clear that in early days it was of an ad hoc nature and intended to providefor some person tenir Is lieu during the absence of the Governor. In 1884,however, it was decided &quot; to enhance the position and influence of the ChiefCivil Officer of the Government by according to him the rank and title of lieutenant-Governor, in accordance with precedents established in some ofthe more important Crown Colonies &quot; and to raise the pay of the post.*With the introduction of self-government in 1921 the functions of the lieutenant-Governor, except when acting for the Governor, decreased in importance since most of his duties passed to the Prime Minister of the day.With the periodic suspensions and final revocation of the Constitution in the&apos;thirties and the inauguration of the Constitutions of 1936 and 1939, theimportance of the post was, of course, bound again to increase.At the close of my discussions with the Constitutional Committee, I broachedthe question of the Lieutenant-Governorship to them, not as a Committee butas individuals representing all shades of public opinion in Malta, and enquiredwhat weight they attached to the retention of the name with all its traditionaldignity. Somewhat to my surprise they appeared to attach no weight at all to this aspect of the matter; in fact, their immediate reaction was to voice an assumption that under the new Constitution to be granted, there would be no need for any corresponding post at all, nor, consequently, for the two posts- * Despatch from the Earl of Derby to the Governor pf Malta, dated 15th April, 1884.
at present provided for Assistants to the Lieutenant-Governor. The motivesin mind were, clearly, the saving of the salaries attached to the three posts andthe desire to emphasize that the Maltese Ministry would be responsible for theconduct of all business other than that pertaining strictly to the &quot; reserved matters &quot;. The Governor, it was apparently assumed, would have his ownpersonal establishment to assist him and a Legal Secretary to advise him on points of law. Asked whom they envisaged as acting for the Governor in his absence, they replied that either the senior officer of the Services or the legal secretary could well do so.The picture drawn seems to me highly unconvincing and even to savour ofirresponsibility. I can only suppose that in drawing it the Committee wereactuated less by a desire to achieve verisimilitude than to emphasize their viewthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should pay the expenses of the Imperial sideof the dyarchy.What staff will ultimately be required for the Imperial side of the dyarchyis not a matter upon which I can properly or usefully express an opinion.Until the new Constitution has been introduced and some experience gained of the manner of its working, a final estimate cannot well be made, but itis clear beyond doubt that the Governor must have a senior administrativeofficer on the spot to assist him in his work on the Imperial side. This officerwould, in turn, I assume, require one or more assistants.During the absence of the Governor, e.g. on leave, the normal practice in recent years has been to appoint the Lieutenant-Governor to act for him(although in times of war the senior Service Officer stationed in the Islandhas sometimes undertaken the task). This practice will no doubt continue inpeace-time, and with the appointment of a civilian Governor it would seemconsistent and conducive to continuity. If so, his status must necessarily be such as to suit him for the responsibility.As regards the question of nomenclature, I see no reason for perpetuatingbeyond the term of office of the present incumbent, a title which may beregarded as out of date and to which the Maltese appear to attach no particular importance. The title which seems to me most aptly to suit the case from every point of view is &quot; Chief Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Govern-ment &quot;.A further point having implications of considerable importance arises inconnection with the post, not hither to mentioned, of &apos;&apos; Secretary to the MalteseImperial Government &quot;. Up to 1927 there was a post of &quot; Clerk of councils and Private Secretary to the Governor &apos;&apos;. Although the duties of this postwere confined to matters concerning the Imperial side of the dyarchy, the postwas filled by a member of the Maltese Civil Service and his salary ( 520) wasvoted annually by the Maltese Legislature. In 1928 the title of the post waschanged to &quot; Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government, Clerk of councils and Private Secretary to the Governor &apos;&apos;, and by way of recognition of thefact that the holder of the post, albeit a Maltese, was an officer of the Imperialside of the dyarchy, provision for his salary ( 600) was included in the reserved Civil List. The post disappeared with the revocation of the Consti-tution in 1936.The Constitutional Committee, feeling no doubt that the staffing of theImperial side of the dyarchy is a matter within the purview of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, did not raise this matter in their discussions with me.The Maltese Civil Service Association, however, seemed to assume andtheir assumption may be generally shared that with the restoration of a constitution similar to that in force between 1921 and 1933, a Maltese Civil
Servant will once again be appointed to a post, the holder of which, in the Iwords of the Royal Commission of 1931, &quot; is a high administrative officerJon the Imperial side of the dyarchy &quot; and one whose office &quot; is subject to the &apos;1same control by the Secretary of State as would be that of an officer of similarstanding in a Crown Colony. &quot;*In 1919 Lord Milner wrote &quot; It is essential, in the interests of both parties concerned, that the respective spheres of the Imperial and local authoritiesin Malta should be clearly defined, and that neither in administration norin legislation should there be any confusion between the functions which each should exercise, or any doubt of the responsibility devolving upon them.&quot;In the light of the above, and believing as I do that the smooth workingof the dyarchicall system of government is very largely dependent upon themaintenance of a clear line of distinction between the two sides of the dyarchy,I hazard the opinion that it will be best in the new order of things, not to revive an artificial arrangement which may have been intended to symboliseco-operation but which by obscuring a principle, is more likely in fact to cause misunderstanding. If this view is accepted, all the duties formerlycarried out by the &quot; Secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government,&quot; when that post existed, will1 become the responsibility of the proposed &quot; chief secretary to the Maltese Imperial Government,&quot; who as suggested above would, no doubt, require one or more Imperial officers to assist him.I have little more to say regarding the contents of the Letters Patent con-stituting the Office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief and the RoyalInstructions beyond what I have written at the beginning of this chapter,but you may wish me to make some comment upon the various Councilswhich are enumerated and defined in those Instruments and which are brieflydescribed in Chapter 2 of this Report. In respect of one of them, the privy council of Malta, I have indeed recommended in Chapter 12 (B) that greater use might be made in future of the opportunity which it provides for joint consultation between the Imperial authorities, the Maltese Ministers and theServices. For the rest, I see no advantage to be gained at this stage fromany alteration in Instruments the contents of which have not been called inquestion and which I believe to have worked well in practice. If, in thelight of experience, after the introduction of the new Constitution, the Governorfinds occasion to propose amendments he will not, I presume, be precluded from doing so.CHAPTER 15.Conclusion.The aims of His Majesty&apos;s Government comprise the security of the Islandas a bastion of the British Empire, the welfare of its people, their progressalong the path of self-government, and the avoidance of friction betweenthe two sides of the dyarchy.The aims of the Maltese are exactly the same, and a retrospective analysis of my discussions with their representatives brings into relief the welcomefact that the arguments were concerned rather with the subsidiary processof reaching agreement upon ways and means of realising a common objectivethan with any questioning of basic principles.It is not, however, to be denied that points of principle can and do arise in connection with subsidiary questions, and I think that the more outstanding* See pages 94 and 95 of the Report of the Royal Commission of 1931.
contentions of the Maltese in matters affecting the new Constitution may be summed up briefly under three heads: (i) Granting that any revocation of the new Constitution about to begranted would be disastrous, and also that the possibility of such disastercannot be completely ruled out, it is contended that, in the event of circumstances arising which seem to the Imperial authorities to necessitaterecourse to such a drastic step, the issue should be laid before the imperial parliament and not determined in any manner savouring of the arbitrary,e.g. by the use of Prerogative Instruments. The Maltese contend, further,that any amendment of the Constitution, however small, should similarly be  subject to the consideration of Parliament, but may fairly be saidto realise the difficulties of this counsel of perfection.I do not deny the abstract desirability of ensuring the fullest ventilation-tion of any matter to which vital importance is attached by any bodyof responsible persons, nor do I doubt that if the Constitution of Maltawere again revoked by Prerogative Instrument or, for that matter bythe Imperial Parliament the good relations which it is so important to maintain between the two parties would be seriously impaired. Butthere still remains the overriding need to ensure that in case of emergencyHis Majesty&apos;s Government are not debarred from fulfilling their respon-sibilities with prompt effectiveness, and I can add nothing to the advice which I have ventured to proffer in Chapter 9 above.(ii) The Maltese contend that the control of their own police force&apos;and the choice of their own judges are functions inherent in the formof self-government which has been promised to them and that it wouldbe an affront to their national dignity if these functions were vested inthe Imperial side of the dyarchy. I have made recommendations favour-able to the Maltese point of view on both points in Chapter 7 (B) above.(iii) They object to the allegedly wholesale and arbitrary manner inwhich matters &quot; reserved &quot; to the Imperial Government are treatedboth in the text of the Constitution of 1921 and in practice. Theynecessarily have an interest in certain aspects of these matters, and feelthat more recognition of the fact is called for, either by way of quali-fication of the text of the Constitution, or by making provision for some form of procedure to be followed, which would afford reasonable oppor-tunities for consultation and the ventilation of their point of view. . Thepoint, with which I have considerable sympathy, is more fully discussed .in Chapter 7 (A) and (B).The question whether there should be a Second Chamber or not absorbed,it is true, more of our time than any other, but it belongs to a very different category. Here no issue arises between the Imperial authorities on the onehand and the Maltese Government on the other. The matter is essentiallyone for decision by the Maltese themselves and in recommending a unicameralsystem of government in Chapter 6 (A) I have tried to interpret what Ibelieve to be the view of the majority of those who have contributed con-structive thought to the subject.For the rest, I feel little doubt that a Constitution framed upon the linesadvocated in this Report will find sufficient favour with the Maltese to warrantits grant, the expectation of its acceptance, and a reasonable confidence thatits operation will be successful.Self-government has been well-earned in Malta and must be made a realitywithin the limits of its application. It is for the Maltese, stimulated by aMl sense of responsibility and aided by such assistance as we can give them,to make a success of it.   The political soil is fertile and strong ramparts
protect the estate, from encroachment. If the plant of self-government *,to thrive and withstand the periodic gusts of controversy and criticism it mvj; tbe a hardy indigenous type no artificial production of the hothouse con-continually requiring grandmotherly care nor liable to tentative disturbance ofits roots whenever the conscientous guardians of the estate feel grounds fordissatisfaction with some transient symptom of weakness.Acknowledgments.It only remains for me to tender my thanks to all who have in one way or another helped me to carry out my task indeed to the people of malta and Gozo as a whole whose friendliness, courtesy and hospitality, havemade my visit to the Islands a delightful experience.To the Chairman and Members of the Constitutional Committee and theFinance Committee of the National Assembly I owe a particular debt of grattitude for the spirit of frank and genial co-operation marking all our 1discussions and smoothing the path of progress along which we had setforth together in the determination to find the highest common factor ofagreement.My thanks are also due to His Excellency the Governor, and to the lieutenant-Governor, Sir David Campbell, who was acting as Governor forsome time after my arrival and to whose assistance, together with that of themembers of the Malta Civil Service, I owe the excellent arrangements madefor my accommodation and comfort. In this connection I have also toexpress my great gratitude to Captain Zammit Cutajar for so generouslylending me the use of his house in Sliema for the whole period of my visit.I would record, too, my warm appreciation of the services of CaptainFrank Critien of the King&apos;s Own Malta Regiment, who, by the courtesyof the General Officer Commanding, acted as my Aide-de-Camp, for theunremitting zeal and efficiency with which he carried out his multifariousduties, and, similarly to Miss M. E. Frodsham and Miss I. W. Bussey whose services as shorthand typists were provided by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Their work was at all times carried out with exactitude and a very willingpromptitude.To the services of Mr. John Fletcher-Cooke of the Colonial AdministrativeService, who accompanied me throughout my stay in the Island and acted as my right-hand-man, I would pay the highest possible tribute. His wideknowledge of the economic, financial and constitutional issues involved,his diligence and capacity, were of immense value, and his assistance was,in all respects, indispensable to me.HAROLD MacMICHAEL.19th September, 1946:

My object in doing so is primarily to express to them the very real sense of honour which I feel at having been chosen to come to Malta on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government as Constitutional Cominissioner. I have been here on several occasions before, but merely as a passing tourist who thoroughly enjoyedvisiting the scene of great historic events, without any idea that he would everhave the opportunity of sharing, in however modest a way, in its developments. Itis no affectation on my part to say that these passing visits thrilled my imaginationin like manner as a first acquaintance with the Holy Land of-Palestine or with&quot; the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome &quot;. But now it isto the people who live in Malta, who love it as their home, and who have latelyplayed so splendid a part in its defence, rather than to the monuments of the pastthat I am accredited, and it is my earnest desire and prayer that I may be enabled to be of some help to them. That, in the simplest terms, describes my objective,and I place myself at your service. I want to get to know you, to understand youraspirations from personal contact, and, so far as I can, to assist in, surmountingdifficulties as they arise.I approach the problems of Malta with diffidence and with a vivid consciousnessof my own shortcomings. I shall find many here who are better equipped thanmyself in knowledge of constitutional law, finance and economics, but I can say inall honesty that I shall find no one who is more determined than myself to findacceptable solutions for the problem of reconciling the desire for responsible govern-ment in internal matters with the safeguarding of Imperial interests. As for themethod of approaching these problems in the first instance, I feel that if I plungeheadlong into discussion and argument and I want to meet as many people as Ican, representative of all types and shades of opinion both they and I will behandicapped at every turn by my lack of knowledge. I propose, therefore, at avery early stage, tc make a tour of Malta and Gozo and try to get some acquaintancewith the daily life of the people, so that I may have a more realistic background forour talks, some consciousness of the general atmosphere. Before doing this, however,I hope to introduce myself to the National Assembly and discuss my procedure withthem. As to this I have, of course, no settled views in respect of detail, but I can at least assure you all that I shall want to remain free to listen to any individual or body. I would only add that I shall hope for entire frankness and freedom inour talks, a minimum of formality and the absence of all acrimony.I will say no more now, except to ask for the friendly co-operation and forbearanceof you all in the vitally important task that lies before us.
appendix V.4ddress made by the Constitutional Commissioner to the National Assembly of Maltaon the 10th May, 1946.Ladies and Gentlemen,I must first of all tender to you my sincere thanks for the welcome which you have given me to-day, and to your President, Professor Contino Preziosi, for the&quot;enerous terms in which he has alluded to me.As I said in the brief broadcast which I made on my arrival, I approach the task which lies before us with diffidence, but also with a very lively sense of the honourconferred upon me an honour carrying with it obligations both to the GovernmentI represent and you to whom I am accredited.   These I shall do my best to fulfil.I have been here only a week but already I have learned to appreciate youressential friendliness and courtesy, and I can but trust that nothing I say or do willdetract from either. In any case I confess to the conviction that a frank approach to any problem is best of all, humbug the worst, and ambiguity the most futile,so please forgive me if from time to time I seem unduly shy of judicious circumlocution.May I read to you my terms of reference in case some of you may not have seen them?   They are To visit Malta in order to formulate detailed proposals, after consultation withrepresentatives of the Maltese people, on the most appropriate means of imple-menting  the declaration  regarding   constitutional  reform   made  by  the  thenSecretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons on the 7th July,1943; and to discuss generally any matters, including questions of finance, that have a bearing on the restoration of Responsible Government.Thus my mission is primarily concerned with constitutional problems, but admittedlyfinancial issues arise affecting these.   This, our first meeting, is not the moment to embark upon details, but I should like, if I may, to make two points.   In the firstplace, I would remind you that the reference I have quoted is to responsible govern-ment in the same sphere as between 1921 and 1933, and it is only fair to say and indeed you will expect it that I shall be bound, in view of the magnitude ofImperial interests and the undeniable responsibilities which still fall upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to suggest a certain number of modifications in the most valuable draft to which vou have devoted so much time and care.   As to this, I am no habitualvisionary,&quot;but I will confess to you that I have had fleeting visions of eventualagreement with at least a majority of your members.   I pray that such may bepossible.   If so, or if the differences are very slight, there need be no aftermathof bickering with all the bitterness  which it engenders.   Moreover,  I think  it is reasonable to assume that the decisions which it must fall ultimately to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to give, are more likely to be favourable to what is jointly recommended.Perhaps I am foolishly optimistic in indulging in such speculation.   I do not know;but of this I am sure: we shall be wise to hitch our wagon to the star of unanimity,and then, even if the air gets a little bumpy,  as I suppose may happen even instellar spheres, our chances of success will at least be greater than if we are onlyanchored to a mundane determination to score political advantage.Ladies and gentlemen, is there not enough dissension in the world to-day?In the second place, I would say that f have already found some realisation in Maltaof the vastness of the financial burden under which Great Britain is labouring, and ourdaily papers leave us in no doubt of the depths of misery into which most of Europehas been plunged, the lack of food and of the necessities of life. You here, as I know from the evidence of my own eyes, have suffered most grievously, but I ask you to remember also the dockland area of London, Coventry, and many other places I speak of England alone for the moment and to bear in mind that there are limits to capacity not for goodwill but for finding the wherewithal in these days. It may, ofcourse, be assumed that additional funds will be forthcoming for war damage and reconstruction in Malta, and, I hope, for education and health services. These arepoints which I shall discuss in the first instance with the Finance Committee, but until some definite decision regarding amounts can be announced, all I dare suggest and i cannot resent it if I am told in reply that it is not my business to make suggestionsupon such matters is that every possible simplification be made in the workingmachinery so that existing and potential funds may be used in the most economicaland effective manner.Now, regarding procedure. I think most of you will agree that one cannot do dailybusiness with an Assembly of over 400 persons, nor do formal discussions with largebodies give results so fruitful as less formal talks with a few people who are qualified
and entitled to represent the views of those who have chosen them for the purpose.It is mere practical commonsense. I would, therefore, suggest for the consideration ofthis National Assembly that committees consisting of not too many members be nominated to represent you, so that I may discuss with them constitutional andfinancial questions respectively. I have already mentioned the discussions which I hope to have with your Finance Committee, or Executive, with whom I should similarly behappy to discuss constitutional matters. Moreover, I have little doubt but that various parties or interests, whether represented on the National Assembly or not, will like to nominate a few of their members to voice their particular views. Any such proposal will be very welcome to me. In fact, I will consider any course which seems to thepeople of Malta well calculated to lead to the ventilation of their wishes, to usefuldiscussion, and to harmonious conclusions.I am concerned only with the attainment of the aim which is common to us all, tomake the best use of this opportunity for strengthening afresh the bonds of friendship and mutual interest which have so long united these Islands with the Mother Country.APPENDIX VITable showing composition of the National Assembly of Malta.Number of category.

To facilitate the preparation of the new Constitution, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have recently sent to the island a Commissioner to go into all relevantmatters with the Maltese representatives. An esseutial feature of the negotiations is the question of finance, which, in view of the extent of the damage done to the island by the enemy, presents many complex issues. In order to obtain an expertanalysis of these matters, Sir Wilfrid Woods was appointed last year as a FinancialCommissioner to visit the island and, after due consultation, to report upon thefinancial problem. This report has recently been published and has formed a most valuable basis for discussion in the island. The Maltese National Assembly naturallywish for information as to His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decision before they feel able toreach their final conclusions on the subject of the restoration of responsible government.His Majesty&apos;s Government have given much consideration to this matter andhave been anxious to arrive at a settlement which, in so far as the difficulties of theirown financial position allow, will generously mark their recognition of Maltese needs.
^ full account of their decisions would occupy too much of the time of the Committee,,ad I have therefore arranged for the publication of a detailed statement in theiOfficial Report to-morrow. For the moment, it will be sufficient for me to say[that the financial assistance proposed for Malta, for which the approval of the! House will in due course be sought, falls under two heads. In the first place, in fulfilment of the assurance given in this House on 10th November, 1942, His Ma]esty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to make a further grant of  20 million from United King-dom funds to supplement the free gift of  10 million made then for the restorationof war damage and the rebuilding of Malta. This additional grant, which, with theformer grant and the interest earned on it, will bring the total sum made availablefor restoration of war damage and reconstruction in Malta to over  31,000,000, willhe constituted a charge on the Consolidated Fund. In the second place, it is intendedto introduce legislation to enable Malta, after the introduction of responsible Govern-roent, to continue to benefit under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Subjectto that provision being passed by Parliament, I propose to allocate to Malta a sumof  1,000,000; the Colony would also, of course, receive its share of the benefit fromcentrally controlled schemes. Certain immediate and temporary help can also bepromised in the matter of a grant-in-aid for the next financial year and assistance towards meeting the cost of commodity subsidies. I trust that these decisions will find acceptance here and in Malta, as affording an assurance that the new constitutionshall not be unduly handicapped by the financial burdens thrown on this small com-munity by its gallant part in the war.APPENDIX VIII.Extract from the Official Report of the House o  Commons 9th July, 1946.Malta (Government Finances).Mr. Mikardo asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he will makea statement regarding the conclusions reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government on thefinancial issues arising in connection with the restoration of responsible governmentin the island of Malta.Mr. George Hall : His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration thequestion of the financial arrangements that must be made with the Governmentof Malta in connection with the restoration to the Colony of responsible Government inaccordance with the promise ma.de by the Secretary of State for tue Colonies in astatement in the House of Commons on 7th July, 1943. They have had theadvantage of studying the able and comprehensive survey prepared by Sir WilfridWoods, who visited Malta last year to undertake a preliminary investigation into the finances of the local Government.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have also had in mind the statement made in theHouse of Commons on 10th November, 1942, announcing that it had been decidedto seek the approval of Parliament for a free gift of  10,000,000 to the Governmentof Malta to be used for the purposes of restoration of war damage and the rebuilding of Malta after the war.   That statement contained the assurance that &quot; if the total; liability of the Malta Government for compensation and rebuilding, after allowingfa contributions from private owners, exceeds the sum of  10,000,000, His Majesty&apos;s;. Government will be prepared to make available such further sums as may be requiredI fomeet liabilities which are found in the circumstances as existing after the war to be\ beyond the capacity of the Government of Malta to meet from its own resources,I laving regard to all other calls upon those resources at that time.&quot;- 3. The gift of  10,000,000 which Parliament approved in 1942 was based on the! test estimate that could be made in the circumstances then existing, and wasI reasonably assumed to be adequate to meet the cost of the repair of the damage; sustained by the Island at the hands of the enemy. While it is impossible to framei eiact and precise estimates of the full expenditure involved, it seems clear that theI original estimate is likely to be substantially exceeded. It is also clear from SirI Wilfrid Woods&apos; Report that this expenditure would be beyond the capacity of theI Malta Government to meet unaided from its own resources. In these circumstances,I Malta can reasonably look to the United Kingdom for the further measure of assistance:: foreshadowed in the statement already quoted.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government, despite the immense difficulties confronting them inI financing their overseas expenditure, will, in accordance with their pledge, makeI available such further assistance, and they have been considering carefully the formI it should take. It could be given either in the form of a series of additional paymentsI agreed from time to time as expenditure is proved in the future to be necessary inI order to carry out the objects of restoration of war damage and necessary reconstruc-I to; or in the form of agreement now on a definite sum of money to be drawn upon
as necessary in accordance with the progress of expenditure.    The first method oilprocedure.would, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, lead to many difficulti of administration and possibilities of friction between themselves and the Government Iof Malta, since differences of opinion would be bound to arise as regards the eligibilityof particular expenditure, the ability of the Government of Malta to make some contribution towards such expenditure from its own resources in the terms of thestatement referred to in paragraph 2 above, and the efficiency and economy of thearrangements for carrying out the works involved.   His Majesty&apos;s Government would,under such a procedure, need to have powers of control over administration in Malta&apos;which would be hard to reconcile with the new status.   They have therefore reached&apos;the conclusion that it would be much more satisfactory to all concerned to fix now atotal sum to be made available for expenditure on restoration of war damage and reconstruction in fulfilment of the promise of further assistance given in 1942.5. -His Majesty&apos;s Government desire that the sum to be fixed in this way should fleave some margin, for reconstruction work not strictly covered by the present defini-tion of making good war damage and, after considering the estimates in Sir WilfridWoods&apos; Report, they propose to seek the approval of Parliament for the provisionfrom United Kingdom funds of a further sum of  20,000,000, making, with theearlier grant, a total of  30,000,000 in all. This sum will not be paid into a trustfund, as was done in the case of the earlier grant, but will be constituted by law a charge upon the Consolidated Fund. Payments to the Malta Government will bemade annually against reasonable anticipations of expenditure as soon as the earliergrant is exhausted. This procedure avoids the need for annual Votes by Parliamentto authorise payments from time to time, [Parliamentary authority being given once and for all by ad hoc legislation which will be introduced as soon as possible. Thenew grant, together with the  10,000,000 already granted and the interest receivedor expected to be received in the future on the earlier grant, would result in there being available for expenditure a total of over  31,000,000. This sum is, of course,intended to be available not only for the payment of war damage compensation butalso for the repair of Government and other public buildings and for general recon.struction. It will be necessary for the Malta Government, i.e. Ministers underresponsible government to submit annually audited accounts showing that the fundsissued under this legislation have been expended on the purposes for which the grantwas voted.   The Act referred to will provide for such a requirement.6. It will be the responsibility of the Malta Government so to frame their policy as to ensure that the funds available are used economically and to the maximum benefit of the Colony. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, of course, be ready to meet any requests that may be made by the Malta Government for technical advice inconnection with the formidable task of reconstruction. During the intervening perioduntil the new Constitution can be brought into operation, it will be the special concern of the present Administration in Malta to press on with the work of repair and reconstruction.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not, however, feel that the financial assistanceto be granted to Malta can be altogether limited to the purposes falling within thescope of the above grant. They realise that the local Government is faced withneed for carrying out a substantial programme of public works in connection withthe social services of the Colony: there is an urgent demand for more schools, betterhospital facilities, an extended water supply and the like. Under its present consti-tution Malta could look for assistance under the Colonial Development and WelfareAct for these purposes: once responsible Government is restored, it would normally be debarred under the Act itself from benefiting from its provisions. As an excep-tional measure, it is intended to introduce legislation to enable Malta, after theestablishment of the new Constitution, to continue to benefit under the Colonial Develop-ment and Welfare Act. Subject to that provision being passed by Parliament, tieSecretary of State would propose to allocate to Malta a sum of  1,000,000 which:would be available for grants to Malta provided that suitable schemes were submittedand approved. Malta would also, of course, receive its share of the benefit fromcentrally controlled schemes financed under the Act, e.g., schemes of research auisurveys; would be eligible for consideration with other Colonies for supplementaryallocations from the remaining unallocated reserve; and would similarly be entitledto share in any further provision which may be made by Parliament on the expiry of the present Development and Welfare Act in 1956.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that these decisions will find general acceptancehere and in Malta as affording an assurance that the new Constitution shall not teunduly handicapped by the financial burdens thrown on this small community by its gallant part in the war. They for their part can reasonably expect that the MateGovernment will spare no exertions to maintain a balanced budget, though they be prepared, if necessary, to make some provision by way of grant-in-aid to nee.
-the costs of administration during the financial year 1947-48 in accordance with SirWilfrid Woods&apos;s recommendation. They also recognise that the complete cessation of commodity subsidies at the end of the current financial year, as recommended bySir Wilfrid Woods, might in the circumstances impose an undue burden on theGovernment and people of Malta.- They are, therefore, prepared to meet one-half of whatever provision for such subsidies in the Malta estimates for 1947-48 is agreedto be necessary, subject to a maximum contribution of ^450,000. This further assistance must be limited to the year 1947-48; thereafter, if such subsidies continueto be required, the cost involved, like that of other social services, will have to bepaid for out of Malta revenue. In future years it will be for Malta by her ownexertions to ensure that her revenue matches expenditure so: that her independenceis not subject to control by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is clear, moreover, thatif progress is to be made in the provision of desirable social services a comprehensive review of the system of taxation must be undertaken with a view not only to theraisin&quot; of the additional revenue required but also to remedying the present inequitablebalance between direct and indirect taxation. Immediate steps will therefore be takento initiate such a review with the object of the introduction as early as practicableof an adequate system of direct taxation.APPENDIX IX.(1)First meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and  theConstitutional Committee of the National Assembly 25th July,  1946.1. The first meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the constitutional committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25th July,1946, in the Commissioner&apos;s Office at the Palace, Valletta.2.

Mr. Miller said that the National Assembly&apos;s Draft Constitution would be ready for submission to the Commissioner, to-morrow, 26th July and Professor. Preziosi 6Ug-gested that as this represented the considered views of the National Assembly itwould be appropriate if Sir Harold would accept the Draft as the basis for discussions and take the initiative in drawing the Committee&apos;s attention to any passages in theDraft which were in his view likely to be unacceptable or open to objection.The Commissioner agreed to this and said that he thought it would be best, ifthe Committee concurred, to take the various Sections of the Draft in numerical order.4. The following points of procedure were then agreed upon:- A. Publicity.   All members agreed with the Commissioner&apos;s proposal that thereshould be no communications to the Press, either official or unofficial,during the course of the discussions, until and unless it was considered desirable to issue a joint communique, when the matter would be recon-sidered.B. Records.   It was agreed that brief notes of any conclusions reached shoulabe kept which would form the official record of the discussions.C. Subsequent Procedure.   It was agreed that the Committee would submit tothe National Assembly any amendments to the National Assembly&apos;s draft which were proposed by the Commissioner.D. Meetings.   All present were agreed on the need to have frequent and regular meetings between the Commissioner and the Committee, and it was hopedthat it would be possible to meet two or three times a week.5. Some preliminary discussion took place regarding the   Sections   dealing   withie question of the Second Chamber .(&quot; Senate &quot; or &quot; Advisory Council &quot;).6.

At the same time he added that a covering Memorandum would be submitted to the Commissioner indue course setting out various further points not referred to in the Draft Constitutionitself, in respect of which the National Assembly desired to make representations toHis Majesty&apos;s Government.5. The discussion regarding a Second Chamber was continued and all aspects ofthis question, including the composition, powers, qualifications of members and duration of the Second Chamber, were considered.The Commissioner pointed out that it was not clear from the National Assernbly&apos;draft what were the Assembly&apos;s intentions as regards the duration of the &quot; AdvisoryCouncil.&quot; The Committee explained that the intention of the Assembly was thatthe life of the &quot; Advisory Council &quot; should come to an end when that of the Legis-lative Assembly did, either by dissolution or by lapse of time (i.e. four years). they regarded it as a natural corollary that, if during the life of a Legislative Assembly,the Prime Minister were changed, the new Prime Minister would be permitted, if he so desired, to make fresh nominations to some or all of the seats in the &quot; AdvisoryCouncil.&quot;The Committee added that they agreed to the necessary amendments to the Draftbeing made without referring the matter back to the Assembly.6. The Committee asked the Commissioner whether it was the Secretary of State&apos;intention to give the National Assembly a further opportunity of considering andcommenting upon the final Draft of the Constitution embodying His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ decisions as was done in 1920. The Commissioner replied that he wasunaware of the Secretary of State&apos;s intentions in this matter, but he undertook tomake enquiry on this point.7. It was agreed that meetings should be held on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.The next meeting was accordingly fixed for 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, the 30th July,in the Commissioners office and it was agreed that the question of the &quot; ReservedSubjects &quot; should be discussed.(Signed) H.

The third meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the Con-stitutional Committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday,the 30th July, 1946, in the Commissioners office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members were present.3. The minutes of the second meeting were read and agreed.4. The Commissioner then referred to the fact that Professor Hyzler, Mr. Millerand Mr. Fletcher-Cooke had scrutinised the copy of the National Assembly&apos;s draft constitution which the Chairman had handed to him at the second meeting, andhad agreed on certain verbal, corrections. Profeseok Preziosi as Chairman andMs. Miller as Secretary of the National Assembly then signed the Draft and returnedat to .ne Commissioner.5. The discussion regarding a Second Chamber was then continued. At the requestof members, the Commissioner indicated his views as to those parts of the Assembly&apos;draft dealing with the Advisory Chamber which he felt unable to recommend to theSecretary of State.   On the question of &quot; powers,&quot; he expressed himself as willing
t to be guided by the views of the Assembly as embodied in the Draft. As regardsIjf&quot; age,&quot; he felt that 21 was too young for membership of a Second Chamber in1 which an element of maturity was essential. He suggested 35 which had been theI qualifying age for membership of the Senate in the 1921 Constitution, and hadI also been recommended in the original draft prepared some months ago by theI Assembly&apos;s Drafting Commission. As regards &quot; composition,&quot; he did not think itI appropriate or useful to have a Second Chamber which did little more than reflectI the views of the Prime Minister. He suggested for consideration that either the1 procedure of the new Ceylon Constitution might be followed or, if that were not1 favoured, that the Prime Minister might nominate not less than half the members of1 the Second Chamber and that the remainder might be appointed by the GovernorI in his discretion. Alternatively a proportion of the remainder might be nominated by the leader or leaders of the Opposition parties.6. The Committee took the view that it would, in any case, be necessary forthem to inform the Assembly of the result of all their discussions with the Com-missioner and that the choice between a properly constituted Second Chamber or no Second Chamber at all should be placed before the Assembly at the same time.[Initialled) L.P. (L. Pkeziosi). (Signed) H. A. MacMICHAEL.1/8/46.(4)Fourth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and theConstitutional  Committee of  the National Assembly 1st August,   1946.1. The fourth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the Con-stitutional Committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday,1st August, 1946, in the Commissioners office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members were present.3. The minutes of the third meeting were read and agreed.4. General. As a preliminary to the discussion of the &quot; Reserved Matters &quot; theCommissioner made a statement of the general principles by which he must be guided. He stressed the need to keep in mind the truth that responsibilities and powers must be exactly co-ordinated, and that since His Majesty&apos;s Government were responsible not only for the security of the Island, but also for its general welfare,they must retain full powers to discharge their responsibilities in both respects.This in no way detracted from their desire to give the people of Malta the widest possible latitude in the control of their own affairs, though- he had to remind theCommittee that the sphere in which His Majesty&apos;s Government had promised to restore self-government was that of the period I92i-&apos;i933. He added that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not accept any reduction of the powers which theyderived from Section 68 of the 1921 Constitution although, of course, it might befound possible and the Commissioner hoped it would to find more simple and direct methods of safeguarding those powers than by the particular process whichhad to be adopted in 19312.Furthermore, on a point of procedure the Commissioner felt that the Committeewould agree with him that neither they nor he was adequately competent to draw up a legal instrument in final form, and that their common object should rather beto reach decisions on certain questions of principle. The Secretary of State&apos;s LegalAdvisors would be responsible for drafting the new Constitution, and they might,and almost certainly would, find it necessary to re-word or re-group certain Sections.5. Enactment and amendment of the new Constitution. The Committee drew theattention of the Commissioner to the fact that the Assembly had unanimouslyrequested that the new Constitution should be granted by an Act of the imperial parliament.The Commissioner in reply stated that the Secretary of State had made it clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to accede to this request. The question had been raised in 1920 and the same reasons as precluded its acceptance then still remained valid.The Committee explained that in pressing this point the Assembly had in mindnot so much the original granting of the Constitution as the necessity of ensuring that any revocation or suspension of, or amendments to, the Constitution in respectof reserved matters should be by legislation passed by the Imperial Parliament. Inthis way more adequate opportunity would be afforded for the&quot; ventilation of Malta&apos;views before any constitutional changes were made effective, and the Constitutionitself would be endued with greater stability.
6.- (i) Power of the Legislature to make laws (Section 41 of Assembly&apos;s Draft).The Commissioner raised no objection to the Assembly&apos;s proposals.(ii) Reserved Matters (Section 42(1) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft).The Committee enquired whether the Commissioner would press for the inclusionof the words &quot; or touching the general interests of Our subjects resident in Malta . . .etc.&quot; which had been added to Section 411(1) of the 1921 Letters Patent by the amending Letters Patent of the 26th June, 1930.The Commissioner replied in the negative, provided the power to amend thisSection, if and when need arose, was retained.(iii) The Services (Section 42(i)(a) of the Assetmbly&apos;s Draft).No comments.(iv) The defence of the Island (Section 42(1)(6) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft).The Commissioner raised no objection, it being agreed that the question of the compulsory acquisition of land, etc., which figured in the corresponding Section ofthe 1921 Letters Patent should be dealt with when sub-section (/) of the Assembly&apos;draft came to be considered.(v) Aviation (Section 42(i)(c) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft).The Commissioner pointed out that as drafted this sub-section excluded CivilAviation from the Reserved Matters. He then read to the Committee a note whichhad been prepared in the Colonial Office on this subject explaining the necessaryco-relation between all forms of aviation and the need to safeguard international conventions. The Committee accepted these arguments and expressed their willing-ness to recommend to the Assembly that Civil Aviation should remain a ReservedMatter.(vi) Surveys for defence purposes.The Commissioner observed that there was no sub-section in Section 42(1) of theAssembly&apos;s Draft corresponding to Section 41(1) (d) of the 1921 Letters Patent, andthat the authorities responsible for the defence of the Island must as a corollary beentitled to make surveys of it.The Committee expressed their willingness to recommend to the Assembly that surveysfor naval, military or aerial defence purposes should remain a Reserved Matter.(vii) Service  communications   (Section  42(i)(d)  of  the Assembly&apos;s Draft).In view of the decision on Section 42(1) (c) it was agreed that this sub-sectionwould require re-drafting to include communications connected with Civil Aviation.(Initialled) L.P.

The fifth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the Constitu-tional Committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Saturday,3rd August, 1946, in the Commissioners Office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members were present.3. The minutes of the fourth meeting were read and agreed, subject to the insertion of the words &quot; an respect of Reserved Matters &quot; after the words &quot; amendments tothe Constitution &quot; in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 5.4. The Commissioner informed the Committee that a reply has now been receivedfrom the Secretary of State to the enquiry which they had made during the second meeting as to whether it was the Secretary of State&apos;s intention to give the national assembly a further opportunity of considering the final draft of the Constitutionembodying His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs decisions. (Paragraph 6 of the minutes ofthe second meeting refers.)In his reply the Secretary of State pointed out that, although in 1920 the DraftInstruments were made public for local comment, the constitutional propriety of suchprocedure had since been called in question, and that it was not now consideredproper for the draft of any&quot; prcrGg3, fcivc instruments to be made public before theywere submitted to His Majesty. In these circumstances, it would not be possible forthe final Draft Instruments to be sent to Malta for further consideration. The Secre-tary of State was, however, prepared to publish the proposals for the new constitution in another form, so as to afford the fullest possible opportunity for comment.The Committee noted with gratification the Secretary of State&apos;s message.
5. Discussion of the &quot; Reserved Matters &quot; was then continued,(i) Compulsory Acquisition and Use of Lands, Buildings, etc., by the Service Depart-ments.   (Sections 42 (1) (e) and (f) of the National Assembly&apos;s Draft.)The Commissioner said that there appeared to be two stages involved in the transi-tion from the 1921 Constitution to the Assemt)ly&apos;s Draft in its final form. Originallythe report of the Assembly&apos;s Drafting Commission had made two amendments to the1921 Constitution in respect of the compulsory acquisition of land, etc., and thecompensation to be paid in such cases:I. (a) The power of assessing compensation in cases of compulsory acquisition hadbeen taken away from the Governor and left to be determined by local law;(&amp;) The compulsory acquisition of land by the Service Departments for recreationalpurposes was made subject to the consent of the Privy Council.II.During the passage of the Drafting Commission^ Report through the Assembly,two further amendments had been made:(c) The acquisition of land by the Service Departments for all purposes was made subject to the consent of the Privy Council;(d) Lands,   buildings,   aerodromes,   etc.   &quot; required &quot;  in  future by the service departments were excluded from the &apos;&apos; Reserved Matters &apos;&apos;.The Committee agreed with this statement of the purport of the amendments made.It became clear from the discussion which followed that the Assembly had had inmind particularly the need to ensure that the compulsory acquisition of land, etc.,by the Services could not be carried out in an arbitrary manner, and instances werecited of cases in which land, etc. had been compulsorily acquired by the service departments in such a manner. It was for this reason they had asked that compulsory acquisition should be subject to the consent of the Privy Council.Having heard the Committee&apos;s views in this matter, the Commissioner said hethought it ought to bo possible to devise some machinery to ensure that no cause forany such grievance arose, without altering the terms of the Constitution.The Commissioner proposed that the two questions (a) the compulsory acquisition of land, etc., by the Service Departments, and(6) the procedure to be adopted in assessing the compensation to be paid shouldbe considered separately.As regards (a), the Commissioner suggested that, though the consent of the privy council could not be made a pre-requisite as had been proposed by the Assembly, apossible solution might lie in some such procedure as the following:  (i) the Governor might be required (possibly in the Royal Instructions) to referall requests by the Service Departments for the compulsory acquisition of land,etc. to the Privy Council in order that the matter might be fully discussed and that the views of both the Service Departments and the Maltese ministers might be considered;(ii) if no agreement was reached during these discussions, the Governor mightbe required, at the request of the majority of the Privy Council, to refer thematter to the Secretary of State for his decision.As regards (6), the Commissioner suggested that some means might be found of meeting the Assembly&apos;s point of view without going so far as to adopt in its entiretythe procedure proposed by the Assembly to which he thought His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be bound to raise objection. He suggested that the Governor, in determination-ing the manner in which &quot;reasonable compensation &quot; should be assessed, might berequired to refer the case to a board of assessment upon which the Maltese wereadequately represented.The Committee agreed to recommend to the National Assembly that the power of compulsory acquisition of land, etc., by the Service Departments which were includedin the 1921 Constitution, should be restored to the Assembly&apos;s Draft, provided that adequate means.could be found, possibly on the lines suggested above, for ensuring that local views were properly ventilated, and that there should be an appeal to theSecretary of State if required.The Committee requested the Commissioner to place before the Secretary of state their desire that the method of assessing compensation in such cases should be that provided by the Laws of Malta,, in order to preserve the principle of non-discriminationas between the treatment of land acquired by the Civil Government on the one handand by Service Departments on the other.The Commissioner promised to do so.
Go(ii) Palaces and other buildings, etc.   (Section 42 (1) (g) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft).It was observed that the Assembly&apos;s proposals were the same as those included in the1921 Constitution, except that:(a) the words &quot; in a Secretary of State or in any other person or persons for ouruse and disposition as Imperial property &quot; had been omitted;(6) the words &quot; with the consent of the Legislature &quot; had been inserted.After some discussion, the Committee said that, as regards (a),, they did not wish topress for the exclusion of the words &quot; or in a Secretary of State &quot; but that they did not see that any useful purpose was served by including the rest of the words in the passagequoted above.The Commissioner replied that,( unless there was some specific intention behind theoriginal inclusion of these words in the 1921 Constitution of which he was unaware, hewas prepared to recommend their omission.As regards (6), the Commissioner pointed&apos; out to the Committee that it would notbe possible for the requirements of the Maltese Imperial Government in this respectto be made dependent upon the consent of the Legislature. At the same time, he agreed that it would be desirable to find means of ensuring that the fullest consideration was given to local views. The Commissioner suggested as a possible solution that theGovernor might be required to consult the Ministry in all such cases and, in case oftheir dissent, to refer the matter to the Secretary of State for his decision.The Committee agreed to recommend to the National Assembly that Palaces andother buildings, etc., should remain a &quot; Reserved Matter &quot; as in the 1921 Constitutionwith, the omission of the words &quot;or in any other person or persons for our use anddisposition as Imperial property,&quot; provided that adequate means could be found,possibly on the lines suggested above, of ensuring that local views were properlyventilated and of providing for appeal to the Secretary of State.(iii) Trade outside the Island.The Commissioner observed that there was no sub-Section in Section 42 (1) of theAssembly&apos;s Draft corresponding to Section 41 (1) (h) of the 1921 Constitution.The Committee said that the reason for this omission was that when the 1921Constitution was in operation, instances had occurred of the Maltese Imperial Govern-ment interfering with trade outside the Island-although in the instances specified therewas no evidence that the proposed trade conflicted with any commercial agreementsentered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Commissioner replied that, althoughof course, there might be considerations of which he was unaware which would resultin His Majesty&apos;s Government insisting on the retention of this sub-Section, he was prepared to recommend that it should be omitted, always bearing in mind that any legislation which the Maltese Legislature passed in matters of trade was subject to the overriding principle referred to in Section 42 (1) (m) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft thatsuch legislation must not conflict with any treaties entered into by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(iv) Importation of goods, etc., for the Services.   (Section 42 (1) (h) of the Assernbly&apos;draft).This is the same as the corresponding Section in the 1921 Constitution and there were no comments.(v) Coinage and Currency.   (Section 42 (1) (i) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft).The Committee explained that the Assembly&apos;s only reason for adding the words&quot; except that for local needs &quot; was to ensure that the Note Security Fund,, the interest on which now formed a very important part of the Government&apos;s revenue, should becontinued. After some discussion,, the Commissioner informed the Committee that,although no decision had as yet been taken about the continuance of this Fund, he wasin a position to assure the Committee that the Colonial Office would certainly press that the existing arrangements should continue.The Committee expressed their willingness to recommend to the Assembly thatCoinage and Currency should remain a &quot; Reserved Matter,&quot; provided that the existing arrangements for the Note Security Fund were permitted to continue.(vi) Immigration.The Commissioner observed that there was no sub-Section in Section 42 (1) of theAssembly&apos;s Draft corresponding to Section 41 (1) (k) of the 1921 Constitution.It was decided that this matter should be considered at the next meeting.(Initialled) L.P.

(6)Sixth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and theConstitutional Committee of the National Assembly 5th August, 1946.i. The sixth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the constitutional committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Monday, 5th August,1946, in the Commissioners Office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members were present.3. The minutes of the fifth meeting were read and agreed, subject to certain amend-ments suggested by the Committee.4. Discussion of the &quot; (Reserved Matters &quot; was then continued.(i) Immigration.The Committee drew attention to the fact that &quot; Immigration &quot; was not reservedin the Constitution recently granted to Ceylon, and also expressed the view that thepeople of Malta ought to be in a position to refuse to agree to the &quot; dumping &quot; of refugees in Malta if they so desired.The Commissioner replied that while he had some sympathy with the views ofthe Assembly in the latter case, he must point out that the Imperial government as the authority responsible for the defence of the Island must retain the right to prohibit the entry of undesirable persons.After discussion the Commissioner summed up by saying that there were clearlytwo separate points at issue:  (a) on the one hand the Maltese Government wished to be in a position toprevent the settlement of refugees, etc.This seemed to him entirely reasonable.(b) on the other hand, the Imperial Government, for overriding reasons of security, must retain the right to prohibit the entry of any persons who might endanger that security.The Commissioner said that he was fully prepared to recommend to the Secretaryof State that in the drafting of the new Constitution provision should be made, ifpossible, to give effect to both principles. The Committee expressed their willingness to make a similar recommendation to the National Assembly.(ii) Naturalisation and Aliens.   (Section 42 (1) (7) of the National Assembly&apos;s Draft.)The Committee said that although there was no difference between this sub-section and Section 41 (1) (I) of the 1921 Constitution, and although no resolution in thismatter had in fact been passed by the Assembly, they felt that when this sub-Sectioncame to be considered in drafting the new Constitution it should, if possible, beamplified and clarified so as to make it conformable to other relevant Sections, andin particular to the preceding sub-Section (&quot; Immigration &quot;).The Commissioner agreed to make the suggestion and to recommend its adoption.(iii) Postal and Telegraphic Censorship.The Commissioner observed that there was no sub-Section in Section 42 (1) of theAssembly&apos;s Draft corresponding to Section 41 (1) (m) of the 1921 Constitution. (he went on to explain the reasons why it was essential that &quot; Postal and TelegraphicCensorship &quot; should be retained among the &quot; Reserved Matters,&quot; viz., considerations of security which arose not only during a war but before it. He was at the sametime prepared to recommend in this case also that provision should be included tomake it abundantly clear that censorship should not be imposed for any reasonsother than those of security.The Committee expressed their willingness in view of the Commissioners assurance to recommend to the National Assembly that &quot;Postal and Telegraphic Censorship &quot;should be included among the &quot; Reserved Matters.&quot;(iv) The Issue and Visa of Passports.    (Section 42 .(1) (k) of the National Assembly&apos;draft.)This is the same as the corresponding Section in the 1921 Constitution and therewere no comments.(v) Appropriation of Revenues accruing in respect of &quot; Reserved Matters.&quot;    (Section42 (1) (I) of the National Assembly&apos;s Draft.)It was observed, that this is the same as the corresponding sub-Section of the 1921Constitution, except that the words &quot; as laid down in Section 60 &quot; have been added.
After sofne discussion it was agreed that the reference to Section 60 in this sub-Section did not appear to have any great significance, and that any further questions arising would be best considered under Section 60.(vi) Treaties.    (Section 42 (1) (m) of the (National Assembly&apos;s Draft.)This is the same as the corresponding Section in the 1921 Constitution and therewere no comments.(Signed) H. A. MacMICHAEL.(Initialled) L.

The seventh meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the Con-stitutional Committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday,8th August, 1946, in the. Commissioners Office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members were present.3. The minutes of the sixth meeting were read and agreed without amendment.4. Discussion of the &quot; Reserved Matters &quot; was then continued.(i) Police.The Commissioner observed that there was no sub-Section in Section 42(1) of theAssembly&apos;s Draft corresponding to Section 41(1) (r) of the 1921 Constitution asamended in 1933 and he invited the Committee to acquaint him with then viewson this matter.The Cornmittee expressed the view that self-government in internal affairs withoutcontrol of the police force would be both meaningless and unacceptable. Theyadded that, during the discussions on this point in the Assembly, this opinion whichwas widely held both within and without the Assembly, was put forward by a numberof speakers in very strong terms.The Commissioner replied that he did not propose to recommend that the controlof the police force should be included among the &quot; Reserved Matters.&quot;(ii) Judges.The Commissioner observed that there was no sub-Secticn in Section 42(1) of theAssembly&apos;s Draft corresponding to Section 41(1) (q) of the 1921 Constitution asamended in 1932. He added that, if the Committee would permit him, he wouldgive a brief historical resume of the policy which had been adopted in this mattersince 1921.In the course of this outline, he referred to the obvious desirability of ensuring that there should be no ground for charges of political bias in the appointment ofthe Judiciary, and quoted a passage from a memorandum in this sense prepared in 1920 by the late Sir M. A. Refalo.The Commissioner added that the Secretary of State wa9 strongly of opinion that&quot; Judges &quot; should be a &quot; Reserved Matter.&quot;The Committee replied that there would always be criticism about the appointmentof judges whether such appointment was entrusted to the Governor in his discretionor whether it was dependent upon advice tendered by the Ministry of the day. Underself-government any Ministry respo-sible for an unsuitable appointment to the Benchwould have to justify their choice to the people at the next elections, whereas inthe case of appointments by the Governor, this corrective would be absent. moreover the Governor would of necessity be dependent upon advice given to him locally andthere was just as great a possibility of an unsuitable appointment as if the PrimeMinister himself had made the nomination.The Committee felt that with the growth of a political consciousness in Maltawhich had developed during the past 25 years, there would be little likelihood of anyappointments on a &quot; party &quot; basis, although these had admittedly been made inthe past. In addition they drew the Commissioners attention to the important factor of prestige. If the people of Malta were to be given the right to conduct their own internal affaire, they must of necessity have the right to nominate theirjudges.
11 The Committee summed up by saying that they wished to return to the provisionso* the 1921 Constitution as amended by the Governors Proclamation of the 15thSeptember, 1921, which provided for the inclusion of the judges&apos; salaries in the reserved Civil List.   They added a request that the relevant Sections should be sof drafted as to make clear the number of judges provided for in the Reserved civil list and the salaries these appointments should carry.The Commissioner referred to the fact that he had already informed the CommitteeI    that, in the Secretary of State&apos;s view, &quot; Judges &quot; should be a &quot; Reserved Matter.&quot;On the other hand, the Committee had expressed the opposite view in very definitei terms and had given their reasons. The Commissioner could do no more than report- to the Secretary of State that he had been unable to obtain the Committee&apos;s agree-i ment. He added, however, that he must regard himself as free to make whateverI recommendations he thought fit to make after due consideration, and the Committee!    said that they fully appreciated this.! The Commissioner then asked the Committee whether, supposing the Secretary ofj State insisted that &apos;&apos; Judges &apos;&apos; should remain a &apos;&apos; Reserved Matter &apos;&apos; they would prefer that it should be included among the list of other &quot; Reserved Matters &quot;1 enumerated in Section 42(1) or whether they would prefer that it should be dealt1 with exclusively under a revised Section 55. In the latter case &quot; Judges &quot; would (more suitably) be grouped with three other matters (namely &quot; Language,&quot; &quot; Reli-8 gious Toleration &quot; and the &quot; Reserved Civil List &quot;) which had received special t-:eat-I    ment in the 1921 Constitution.I      The Committee replied that they still pressed that the appointment of judges should;1   be entrusted to the Maltese Ministry, but if the Secretary of State was not preparedI    to accede to this request, they would prefer the latter of the two courses set out above.I    (iii) Reservation to His Majesty of Power to Revoke, Alter or Amend Certain Sectionsof the Constitution.J The Commissioner reminded the Committee that at their fourth meeting he had   informed them that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept any reduction in thepowers which they derived from Section 6S of the 1921 Constitution although, ofi course, as he had said then, it might be found possible to safeguard those powers in a. more simple and direct way. He also referred to the Secretary of State&apos;s decision that His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to accede to the Assembly&apos;s request thatthe new Constitution should be granted by an Act of the Imperial Parliament.&quot;With these two basic factors in mind,  the Commissioner asked the Committee1 whether they would prefer that the powers to be retained by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-:&quot;;  ment to legislate in Constitutional matters by Prerogative Instrument, should be in aH   similar form to that embodied in Section 68 of the 1921 Constitution or, as seemedI to him infinitely preferable, should follow the clear and simple wording of Section 30(4)of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946, under which power &quot; to revoke,,add to, suspend or amend this Order or any part thereof &quot; by a further Order inCouncil was reserved.The Committee replied that they must emphasise once again that the Assemblywere pressing at least that any revocation or suspension of, or amendments to, the; Constitution should be by Act of the Imperial Parliament, but IF purely for the6ake of argument the Secretary of State was unable to agree to this request, theyWm would view the inclusion of a section similar to Section 68 of the 1921 Constitutionflj with less disfavour than a Section in more general terms such as Section 30(4) of the? new Ceylon Constitution.   They pointed out that Section 68 restricted the power ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to amend the Constitution by prerogative legislation to alimited number of Sections and also that no power to revoke the Constitution (except by Act of the Imperial Parliament) was retained.&quot;S] It would bo useless, the Committee added, to expect the Assembly to consider a recommendation to agree to a Section in general terms similar to that included in the: new Ceylon Constitution. The Assembly would certainly [regard such a Section asderogatory to tie dignity of the people of Malta. It would, in their view, be moreconsonant with that dignity that the exercise of their rights by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-: ment should be provided for on lines analogous to those of 1921.(Signed)   H.

Discussion of the &quot; Reserved Matters &quot; was then continued.(i) Decision as to whether a &quot; Reserved Matter &quot; is affected or not.The Commissioner invited the Committee&apos;s attention to Sections 44 (b) and 63 (2&apos;) ofthe Assembly&apos;s Draft, corresponding to Sections 44 (6) and 66 (2) of the 1921 Con-stitution, in which provision is made in certain circumstances for references by theGovernor to the Secretary of State as to whether a law passed by the Maltese Legislatureor the exercise of certain powers by the Maltese Ministry affects any &quot; ReservedMatter &apos;&apos;.The Commissioner informed the Committee that the Secretary of State&apos;s legal adviser, during a preliminary consideration of Section 42 (1) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft,which corresponds to Section 41 (1) of the 1921 Constitution, had suggested that asimilar provision should be included here to make it clear that the Secretary of state was the final arbiter in all cases arising under the Section in question.The Committee agreed that this was desirable but suggested that it might be more convenient to have a single Section providing for reference to the Secretary of State inall such cases rather than to have, as was now contemplated, three separate Sectionsdealing with this matter.The Commissioner undertook to bring the Committee&apos;s views on this point to thenotice of the Secretary of State.The Commissioner also drew the Committee&apos;s attention to the fact that the wording of Section 42 (1) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft, although admittedly it followed the wording of the corresponding Section in the 1921 Constitution, was vague and ambiguous. he pointed out, for example, that as the Section stood it might be deemed to prevent the maltese Legislature from passing legislation involving the imposition of customs dues,inasmuch as such legislation could be held to affect &quot; the general interests of Oursubjects not resident in Malta &quot;. He explained, therefore, that the drafting of thisSection would require careful consideration, not only to include provision for an appealto the Secretary of State as suggested above, but also to clarify its meaning in general,and the Committee agreed that this was desirable.(ii) Governors Certificate that a Bill affects a &quot;Reserved Matter&quot;.The Commissioner observed that there was no Section in the Assembly&apos;s Draftcorresponding to Section 43 of the 1921 Constitution, and he enquired of the Committeewhy this Section had been omitted.The Committee in reply gave three reasons (a) the Assembly did not consider it right or proper that the Governor shouldbe in a position to prevent the Legislature discussing any matter;(6) even if the Secretary of State decided that a proposed Bill affected a&quot; Reserved Matter &quot;, it was difficult to see how he or the Governor could in practiceprevent the Assembly from discussing the matter;(c) in view of the powers given to the Governor and to the Secretary of Stateunder the next Section of the 1921 Constitution (i.e., Section 44 of the Assembly&apos;draft), it did not seem in the Assembly&apos;s view, to be a matter of sufficiently vitalimportance that similar powers should be granted at an earlier stage in theproceedings under another Section.The Commissioner replied that he was unaware oi any objection to the omission ofthis Section, and he promised to bring to the notice of the Secretary of State the view taken by the Assembly in order that the point might receive careful consideration.(iii) Language.    (Sections ao (c), (d) and (e), 54 and 55 of the National AssemblesDraft.)The Commissioner pointed out to the Committee that Section 40 (e) of the AssemblesDraft made it possible for all &quot; journals, entries, minutes and proceedings &quot; of theLegislature to be kept solely in Maltese.   Attention was also drawn to the fact that
under Section 40 (c) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft, no provision was made for the recordingin the journal of the House concerned of an English translation of those speeches whichwere delivered in Maltese.Having regard to the principles upon which Sections 40 (d) and 54 of the Assembly&apos;draft were based, namely, that wherever possible all public business should be conducted in both English and Maltese, the Committee asked the Commissioner to record thefollowing by way of explanation of the Assembly&apos;s intentions. While they agreed thatin theory a necessary corollary of the principle enunciated above would be a translationinto English of all speeches made in Maltese in either House of the Legislature, they realised that in practice the difficulties which would arise from such a procedure wouldbe insuperable. They concluded, therefore, that as far as the Legislature was concerned,all that could be done would be to provide that all &quot; journals, entries, minutes and proceedings &quot; should be recorded in both languages.The Commissioner undertook to bring these views to the notice of the Secretary ofState, so that the appropriate drafting amendments could be made to sub-sections (c)and (e) of Section 40 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft.At the request of the Commissioner, the Committee clarified the Assembly&apos;s intentions as expressed in Section 54 of their Draft, and it was agreed that these would be exactlyexpressed if sub-section (1) of that Section were redrafted as follows: - &quot; English and Maltese shall be official languages, and public documents andnotices of public importance issued by the Government of Malta shall be in thoselanguages.&quot;(dv) Religious Toleration.    (Section 53 of the National Assembly&apos;s Draft.)The Commissioner said that he fully appreciated the motives which had impelledthe Assembly to include sub-section (1) of Section 53 of their Draft. He assured the Committee that both His Majesty&apos;s Government and he himself accepted thestatement of fact as set out in that sub-section, but it was his duty to point out to the Committee that in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, a Constitution granted by them was not the appropriate place in which to include a declaration of faith.He invited the Committee&apos;s attention to the passage in which Mr. L. S. Ameryhad explained this when the 1921 Constitution was being considered. The Com-missioner added that he did not intend to press the Committee to refer this matterback to the Assembly because he realised that such a course might lead to mis-understanding, and to the wholly unwarranted conclusion that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment wished to deny that the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith was the religion of malta. He would confine himself to taking note of the Assembly&apos;s wishes and toexplaining, as he had done, the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Committee replied that they would like to place on record their appreciation of the Commissioners understanding of their difficulties and of his approach to theproblem. \Turning to the proviso in Section 53(3) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft, the Com-missioner pointed out that as this was drafted it might be deemed to permit thebanning of public instruction in Church of England schools and the restriction of educational facilities offered by the Services in Malta. The Committee hastened to assure the Commissioner that this proviso was only intended to cover the case of schools maintained by and under the control of the Government of Malta.The Commissioner replied that while he appreciated this clarification of the Assembly&apos;intentions, and would bring the Committee&apos;s views to the notice of the Secretary ofState as in the case of sub-section (1), he was still of the opinion that the Govern-ment of Malta could give effect to them by administrative means without any specific&apos;reference in the Constitution.(v) Reserved Civil List.   (Section 60 of the National Assembly&apos;s Draft.)The Commissioner observed that the wording of Section 60(1) of the Assembly&apos;draft differed from the wording of Section 63(1) of the 1921 Constitution, and asked the Committee if they would clarify this point.The Committee replied that while the Assembly did not wish to encroach in anyway upon the provisions of the Reserved Civil List, they considered it only fairthat where the Governor wished to appropriate &quot; other sums,&quot; i.e. additional sums,for defraying the expenses of the Maltese Imperial Government, it should be necessaryfor him first to obtain the consent of the Maltese Legislature. The Commissionerreplied that this seemed to him to be a reasonable request, and that he did not propose to raise any objection.[Signed) H. A. MacMICHAEL.13/8/46,(Initialled) L. P. (L.

MNinth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and theConstitutional Committee of the National Assembly .13th August, 1946.I. The ninth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the. Con-stitutional Committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday,13th August, 1946, in the Commissioners Office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members, except Mr. R. G. Miller, who was on vacation in Gozo, werepresent.3. The minutes, of the eighth meeting w-i/re read and agreed without amendment.(i) His Majesty&apos;s Power of Disallowance.4. The Commissioner remarked that there was no Section in the Assembly&apos;s Draftcorresponding to Section 47 of the 1921 Constitution.The Committee gave two reasons in explanation: in the first place, the Governoras His Majesty&apos;s representative has full power either to assent to a law in HisMajesty&apos;s name or to withhold his assent or to reserve the law for the significationof His Majesty&apos;s pleasure. Secondly, if, in point of fact, the power of disallowancewere exercised after a law had been in operation for any period up to one year,serious administrative difficulties might result. They desired to make clear that therewas no idea whatever in their mind of interfering with the prerogative.The Commissioner replied that while he appreciated the motives behind theAssembly&apos;s proposal, he was bound to point out that there might be constitutional difficulties in accepting it. In view, however, of the fact that the Assembly had repeated in Section 46 of their Draft, the provision contained in Section 48 of the1921 Constitution whereby the Governor was permitted to reserve any law what so-ever passed by the Legislature for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, he(the Commissioner) felt he would be justified in bringing the views of the assembly to the notice of the Secretary of State with a recommendation in their favour. he must, however, at the same time recommend that the Governor should be required(and not merely empowered) to &quot; reserve &quot; certain classes of laws. Whether these instructions should be contained in the Constitution or whether they should form partof the Royal Instructions was a matter which would have to be left to the Secretaryof State.The&apos; Commissioner added that the classes of laws which he had in mind were asfollows: (a) those which discriminated against persons not of Maltese birth or descent(Section 48(a)  of the 1921 Constitution);(6) those which encroached on &quot; Reserved Matters &quot; (Sections 48(b) and 41(3),(4) and  (5) of the 1921  Constitution); /(c) those which had the effect of amending the Constitution (Section 48(c) ofthe 1921 Constitution);(d) those which related to any of the Special Matters (i.e. &quot; Religious Tolera-tion,&quot;   &quot;Language,&quot;   &quot;Judges&quot; and &quot;Reserved Civil List&quot;).The Committee said that they regarded it as self-evident that these four classesof laws should be &quot; reserved &quot; and agreed that it would be proper for the Secretaryof State to make &quot; reservation &quot; mandatory in respect of them. They pointed out,however, that Section 48(b) of the 1921 Constitution merely repeated what hadalready been said in Section 41(3), (4) and (5) regarding the &quot;reservation&quot; ofcertain laws and the Commissioner agreed to invite the Secretary of State&apos;s attentionto this point so that any necessary clarification could be effected when the newConstitution was drafted.It was also observed that if Section 47 of the 1921 Constitution be omitted, Section53 will also have to be omitted as a conse-jucnce.(ii) Signification of His Majesty&apos;s Pleasure on Proposed Laws which have been reserved.The Commissioner observed that in Section 47 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft which corre-sponds to Section 49 of the 1921 Constitution, the period of one year after which,unless His Majesty&apos;s assent has been signified, the Law lapses, has been reduced to six months. The Commissioner suggested that such a short period as six months was unacceptable for three reasons :  (a) it was contrary to normal precedent which usually provided for a period oftwo years;(b) it savoured of indecent haste;(c) a number of proposed Laws would certainly lapse because of the short periodallowed for assent,
In the discussion which followed, the point was made that there was considerableanger in fixing any time limit; the maximum time allowed- for the consideration ofLaws reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s ipleasure might so easily become the minimum time required by the Department concerned&apos;&apos;for  dealing with thepreliminaries.The Committee expressed their readiness to recommend to the Assembly that the precedent of the new Ceylon Constitution should be followed and that there shouldbe no reference to any time limit in this Section.(iii) Governors Power of Assent.The Commissioner pointed out thai in amending sub-Section (c) of Section 44 ofthe 1921 Constitution, which is similarly numbered in the Assembly&apos;s Draft, theAssembly had taken away from the Governor his discretionary power to grant orwithhold his assent to Laws presented to him by the Legislature, or to &quot; reserve &quot;them, which power is, in fact, already provided for under Section 46 of the Assembly&apos;draft.The Committee agreed that this had been done by a misunderstanding and they accepted the Commissioner^ proposal that the position should remain as it was underthe 1921 Constitution, thus preserving the Governors discretionary power either togrant his assent or to withhold his assent or to &quot;(reserve.&quot;(iv) Governors Power to transmit Bills to the Legislature.The Commissioner observed that there was no Section in the Assembly&apos;s Draftcorresponding to Section 29 of the 1921 Constitution. The Committee stated that thisSection did not appear to serve any useful purpose and that, if included, it might lead to public friction between the Governor and the Prime Minister. If the Governorconsidered that it was desirable to introduce certain legislation, he could easily consult the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister agreed with the Governors views and considered that the proposed legislation could be passed, he would, no doubt, takethe necessary steps. But if, on the other hand, the Prime Minister did not share the Governors view, it was difficult to see how a message from the Governor couldinduce the Legislature to pass the proposed legislation in the face of the Prime Minister&apos;sdisagreement.The Committee agreed to recommend that this Section should be omitted from thenew Constitution.(v) Governor&quot;s Confirmation of Election of Officers of the Legislature.The Commissioner observed that Sections 9 (1) and 16 (1) of the 1921 constitution which provided for the confirmation by the Governor of the election of the president and the Vice-President of the Second Chamber and the Speaker and Deputy speaker of the Legislative Assembly, have been amended in the Assembly&apos;s Draft (Sections7 (a) and 17) so as to exclude this provision. He suggested that the procedure proposed in the 1921 Constitution added a certain dignity to the offices concerned.The Committee took the view, however, that it would toe impracticable for theGovernor to decline to confirm the elections of the Legislature in this respect andthey also observed that there was no similar provision in the new Ceylon Constitution.The Commissioner agreed to recommend that this provision should be omitted inthe new Constitution.jvi) Relations between the Governor and the Ministry and between the Governor andthe Legislature.The Commissioner observed that, although sub-Section (5) of Section 51 of theAssembly&apos;s Draft follows the wording of sub-Section (5) of Section 54 of the 1921Constitution, it might well toe held that legislation by way of reference to an undefinedpractice prevailing elsewhere was unsatisfactory and might lead to endless litigation.While it was desirable that the relations between the Governor and the Ministry and between the Governor and the Legislature should, in point of fact, follow as closely as possible the conventions existing in the United Kingdom, it was very doubtfulwhether a provision in the Constitutional Instrument was the best means of ensuringthis. The Commissioner, therefore, suggested that this sub-Section should be confined to the statement that the head of the Ministry was the official channel of communi-cation between the Governor and the Ministry and that the other matters referred toin this sub-Section might, if necessary, be included in an administrative instructionfrom the Secretary of State.The Committee accepted this view and observed that, as far as the relationsbetween the Ministry and the Legislature were concerned, this could more properly be dealt with toy the Legislature^ own Laws of procedure and by local constitutional practice.
(vii). Appointment of Ministers. I ((a) The Committee observed that, although Section 51 (1) of the Assembly&apos;s Draft&apos; ffollows (with minor amendments) the wording of Section 54 (1) of the 1921 Oonstitu- Ition, they now wished to suggest to the Commissioner that the wording of Section I46 (3.) of the new Ceylon Constitution should be followed as regards the appointment Iof Ministers.The Commissioner undertook to bring the views of the Committee to the notice fof the Secretary of State. j(6) The Commissioner pointed out that, although the 1921 Constitution had included Ia list of Departments from the Heads of which the Ministers should be appointed, it 1might foe held that the inclusion in a Constitutional Instrument of such a list wasinappropriate and that it would be better to leave the matter to be worked outadministratively.While he had no objection to the Assembly&apos;s recommendation that the numberof Ministers should not exceed eight, he felt that the Heads of the Departments ofFinance and Justice should invariably be included among this number.The Committee expressed their agreement with these views.(Signed) H. A. MaoMICHAEL.(Initialled) L. P. (L. Pseziosi). 17/8/46.17/8/46.(10)Tenth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and theConstitutional Committee of the National Assembly-17th August,  1946.1. The tenth meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the constitutional committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Saturday, 17th August,1946, in the Commissioners Office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members, except Mr. R. G. Miller who was on vacation in Gozo, were present.3. The minutes of the ninth meeting were read and agreed.(i) Qualifications of Electors.4. (a) Universal Suffrage. It was observed that Sections 13 and 14 (1) of the 1921Constitution had been amended in Section 12 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft so as to provide that any male or female British subject of the age of 21 years and upwards (with certainstatutory exceptions) was entitled to vote.The Commissioner undertook to recommend acceptance of this proposal.(b) Consequential Amendments. It was agreed that, in order to give effect touniversal adult suffrage on the principle of &quot; one person one vote,&quot; Sections 21, 22and 23 of the 1921 Constitution referring to certain property qualifications, should be omitted.. (c) Disqualification due to receipt of charitable relief.&apos; Section 30 (3) of the 1921Constitution has been amended in the corresponding Section of the Assembly&apos;s Draft(Section 30 (ii) ) by the emission of the words &quot; or has within three years before theelection received charitable relief in Malta from any public source.&quot;The Commissioner undertook to recommend acceptance of the proposed omission.(d) Persons sentenced for certain crimes. The Committee pointed out that Section 31of the Assembly&apos;s Draft followed the provisions of Section 30A which was added tothe 1921 Constitution by the Malta Constitution Act, 1932. The effect of this is to restore to a person sentenced for any of certain crimes, his rights as an elector as soonas his sentence has expired.(ii) Powers of Maltese Court of Appeal in Electoral Cases.Section 34 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft repeats the provisions of Section 33 of the 1921Constitution with the addition of the word &quot; finally &quot; before the words &quot; decided by our Court of Appeal in Malta.&quot; The Commissioner pointed out that, while it had beenestablished by a decision of His Majesty&apos;s Privy Council in 1930 that decision of the maltese Court of Appeal in electoral cases was, in fact, final, the use of the word&quot; finally &quot; was inappropriate from a drafting point of view.The Committee replied that, while they appreciated this point, they would be glad if the Commissioner would bring to the notice of the Secretary of State the Assembly&apos;swish that, when this Section came to be re-drafted, specific provision should be includedthat the Maltese Court of Appeal&apos;s decision was final, and this the Commissioner under-took to do.
(iii) Number of Members of Legislative Assembly.Section 9 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft increases to forty the number of members of theLegislative Assembly which had been fixed at thirty-two by Section 12 of the 1921Constitution.The Commissioner agreed to recommend acceptance of this increase.ft was noted that a consequential increase of members returnable by each of the eightelectoral divisions, from four to five, will be necessary as provided in Section 15 of theAssembly&apos;s Draft (Section 15 (2) of the 1921 Constitution refers).(iv) Quorum of Members.(a) Section 17 of the 1921 Constitution provided for a quorum of sixteen members outof a total of thirty-two in the Legislative Assembly. Section 19 of the Assembly&apos;s Draftprovides for a quorum of twenty-one members out of a total of forty.The Commissioner suggested that, while he had no desire to raise objection, this number might be regarded as rather high.(b) It was agreed that, if there was to be a Second Chamber, a quorum of seven outof a total of thirteen would not be unreasonable.(v) Time Limit within which Second Chamber must consider laws passed by theLegislative Assembly.The Committee drew attention to the fact that, although Section 42 of the 1921Constitution as amended, set a limit to tbe time within which the Senate had to considerlaws passed by the Legislative Assembly, a similar provision had been inadvertentlyomitted from Section 43 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft.The Committee engaged to bring this point to the notice of the Assembly when thequestion of the Second Chamber was referred back to them.(vi) Length of Life of the Legislative Assembly.Section 18 of the 1921 Constitution had provided that the Legislative assembly should continue for three years unless it was previously dissolved by the Governor.Section 20 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft had increased this period to four years.The Committee explained that, in the view of the Assembly, three years was tooshort a period and they also pointed out that four years was the period prescribedunder the existing Constitution granted in 1939.The Commissioner agreed to recommend acceptance of the Assembly&apos;s proposal.(vii) Qualifications of Members.It was observed that the Assembly had provided in Section 32 (iv) of their Draftthat civilian employees of the Service Departments in Malta should be permitted to stand for election to either House of the Legislature. This had not been permitted under Section 31 (e) of the 1921 Constitution.The Commissioner explained that he was aware of the arguments in favour of theAssembly&apos;s proposal since they had been cogently put at a meeting which he had had with representatives of the Malta Labour Party&apos;s Executive. He could only repeatto the Committee what he had already told the Labour Party that while he himself was unaware of any intrinsic objection to the Assembly&apos;s proposal and hoped that itwould be possible to adopt it, the matter was one upon which he could not makea definite recommendation to the Secretary of State, since a decision could only betaken after consultation between the Colonial Office and the Service Departments athome.The Committee asked that, in bringing the Assembly&apos;s request to the notice of theSecretary of State, the Commissioner should point out that a distinction had, in fact,been made between the civilian employees of the Service Departments and the employees of the Government of Malta when the former were given permission tobecome members of the National Assembly.(viii) Power of the Governor to make certain Amendments by Proclamation.The omission of Section 67 of the 1921 Constitution from the Assembly&apos;s Draft was discussed and the Commissioner expressed the view that the purpose of this Sectionhad merely been to provide for consequential amendments which might have been,and in point of fact were, found necessary when the Constitution was first broughtinto operation.The Committee said that no objection would have been raised to the inclusion of asimilar section, if it had been made clear that only consequential amendments which did not affect questions of principle or powers were involved.
go(is) Ultimate Powers of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Committee asked what form the powers of His Majesty&apos;s Government pre-&apos;viously contained in Section 68 of the 1921 Constitution (see minutes of seventhmeeting), were likely to take, in the drafting of the new Constitution.The Commissioner replied that, while it was clear, as he had previously pointed outthat His Majesty&apos;s Government must retain residual powers sufficient to meet in fulltheir responsibilities for the general welfare of the Island, he was unable to forecast the precise form in which these powers would be embodied. He also remarked that if,as he hoped and indeed would urge the new Constitution was to be so drafted asto reduce ambiguities to a minimum, it would no doubt be found necessary to regroupsubjectivally principles agreed upon with the Committee and this would involveredrafting certain Sections altogether.(x) Memorandum covering certain further points.The Committee referred to the fact which had already been mentioned at the second meeting, that a memorandum covering three further points would be submitted to theCommissioner.   The points to be covered were:  (a) Method of granting the new Constitution;(b) Access of Maltese Ministers to His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the United Kingdom;(c) Transference of His Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibility for Malta from theColonial Office to the Dominions Office, on the analogy of Southern Rhodesia.The Commissioner replied that he would forward to the Secretary of State anysupplementary representations which the Assembly wished to make.The question of the way in which the new Constitution should be granted hadbeen discussed by the Commissioner with the Committee and the respective points of view had been fully recorded in the minutes of the fourth and seventh meetings.As regards the direct access of Maltese Ministers to His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in theUnited Kingdom, the Commissioner explained that he had already had an opportunityof discussing this matter with representatives of the Malta Labour Party&apos;s Executive.While he felt that the question did not fall within his terms of reference and did not anticipate any likelihood of His Majesty&apos;s Government acceding to the Assembly&apos;request for &quot; direct access &quot; of Maltese Ministers, he would certainly bring to thenotice of the Secretary of State the suggestion which had been mooted that an ad hoc committee might be established in the United Kingdom to ensure closer co-co-ordination between the work of the Colonial Office, the Admiralty, the War Office and the AirMinistry in all matters of common interest relating to Malta. In the event of suchcommittee being formed it was considered essential that Maltese Ministers should havethe right of access to it.As regards the question of transferring the responsibility for the affairs of Malta to the Dominions Office, the Commissioner said that he doubted the usefulness of discussing with the Committee a proposal which the Secretary of State had already informed him was out of the question but, as in the case of the other two mattersmentioned above, he was prepared to bring to the notice of the Secretary of State anyarguments in favour of this proposal which the Assembly might wish to submit.(Signed) H.

The eleventh meeting between the Constitutional Commissioner and the Constitu-tional Committee of the National Assembly took place at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 20thAugust, 1946, in the Commissioners Office at the Palace, Valletta.2. All members were present.3. The minutes of the tenth meeting were read and agreed.4. Public Officers. The Commissioner pointed out that although Sections 61 and62 of the Assembly&apos;s Draft which deal with the appointment, etc. of Public Officers,follow the provisions of Sections 64 and 65 of the&quot; 1921 Constitution, he was aware that there was some idea of perpetuating the existing Public Services Commission ^ asis the case in the new Ceylon Constitution. This would have the effect of removingfrom the Governor in Council the power of appointing Public Officers.
gX - -The Committee said they were opposed to any such change and expressed their intention of referring the matter to the National Assembly.The Commissioner informed the Committee that he proposed to receive a deputation from the Malta Civil Service Association in the near future.5. Disqualifications of Members of either House of the Legislature. The Commis-sioner referred the Committee to Sections 32 and 33 of&apos; the Assembly&apos;s Draft and pointed out that the provisions of these two Sections which were obviously intendedto be complementary to one another were not, in fact, similar. The Commissionersuggested that it would probably be found convenient when these Sections came to bere-drafted to combine them into one Section, and the Committee raised no objectionprovided that there was no change of principle.iSigned) H.

The Committee also submitted the Memorandum (appended) referred to inparagraph 4(x) of the minutes of the Tenth Meeting.6. Sir Harold MadMichael said that he Droposed to leave Malta on Thursday, 19thSeptember, for the United Kingdom, and wished to take the opportunity providedby this, his final meeting with the Constitutional Committee, to express to themcorporately and individually his appreciation of the friendliness and understanding which had characterised their discussions with him. Though unanimity on all pointshad not been possible he felt that the extent of agreement reached was due largely to the fact that both parties had had. in view throughout a single objective, namely,the enjoyment by the Maltese of the widest degree of self-government compatible with Imperial interests. He very sincerely hoped that their labours might prove to have been instrumental in laying the foundations of a lasting settlement and onewhich would perpetuate a happy relationship between the two sides of the dyarehyand conduce to the welfare of the Island.7. In reply Professor Pireziosi on behalf of the Committee thanhed Sir HaroldMacMichael for his valedictory remarks. The Committee had in truth been animatedthroughout by a desire to reach agreement, and had all along appreciated the difficultiesin the way of complete unarnimity. The members of the Committee, both individually and collectively, desired to reciprocate the sentiments so well expressed by Sir Haroldin their regard.(Initialled) L. P. (L.

Annexure memorandum(To accompany the draft of Autonomous Constitution prepared by theNational Assembly).The National Assembly, besides considering the form of Constitution, which in its opinion would best suit the requirements of the community, has given careful con-sideration to certain other matters, and has decided to put forward a request on thesematters in the form of a Memorandum for submission to the Rt. Hon. the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.In the first place, the National Assembly wishes to represent most strongly theneed for mutual trust as between His Majesty&apos;s Government in Britain and theGovernment of Malta. With this object in view, the greatest practicable degree of stability should be given to the Constitution, the Maltese Ministry should be placedin as favourable a position as possible to deal with urgent problems of magnitudeaffecting the Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Britain, and the Countryitself should be raised in status compatibly with its past and recent history.It is therefore desired to put forward for consideration the following three sug-suggestions:  (a) that the Constitution be granted toy an Act of Parliament and that anyfurther legislation it may in future toe considered necessary toy His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to enact, amend or repeal in this Constitution should similarly be passed toy an Act of Parliament.(6) that the Maltese Ministers should have the right of direct access to Min-ministers in Britain.(c) that Malta should become the responsibility, as far as concerns His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, of the Dominions Office, instead of the Colonial Office as at present.On all these three points the Assembly was unanimous and they represent theexpression of the general desire amongst the community of Malta. In deciding onthe form of the draft, as far as concerns the most important departures from theConstitution of 1921, and in putting forward these extra-constitutional claims, theNational Assembly has been guided by experience in the actual working of self-govern-ment between 1921 and 1933, the need for a form of authoritative contacts withthe Government in Britain and the progress occurring within the British Empire. our last request, for instance, is based on a precedent established in Southern Rhodesia.In the course of discussions between the Constitutional Commissioner and theConstitutional Committee of the National Assembly, the Committee was informed that none of these requests is likely to be considered with favour. As regards the secondone, the alternative suggestion was put before the Committee that it may toe possibleto form an ad hoc Committee in the United Kingdom to ensure closer co-operationbetween the work of the Colonial Office and the Defence Service Departments jn all matters of common interest relating to Malta. Though not abandoning in any waythe claim of access direct to the Ministers in Britain, the Committee feel that in theevent of the alternative toeing adopted, rather than the one suggested by the national assembly, it should be part of the arrangement that Maltese Ministers with anyaccredited representatives be entitled to attend on occasion the meetings of thisCommittee.[Signed) R.
