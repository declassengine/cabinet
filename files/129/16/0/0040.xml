W. 1.26TH JANUARY,  1947.
F.M.  U/7/3PRIME minister am being strongly pressed &quot;by the head of the BritishPood Mission, in North America to make an immediate visit to washington to discuss certain outstanding problems, withMr.  Clinton Anderson, and to attend the next, meeting of theInternational Emergency Pood Council.    This request to visitWashington has. been made with the knowledge of our Ambassadorthere.,2.      You will recall that in October I submitted a paper tothe Cabinet on the necessity for a new approach to theUnited States Government (0. P. h.6/396).    I then warned mycolleagues that the food outlook for 19h7 was gravely die-appointing, and that the attitude adopted by the United StatesGovernment was likely to be a decisive factor affecting our19h7 food supplies.     I specified the factors which made itnecessary to discuss with the Americans, wheat, fats, meat,bacon and rice.    The Cabinet decided to invite the foreign secretary to discuss with members of the United States Adminia-tration the possibility of taking steps to improve the supplyof foodstuffs to the United Kingdom.    It was hoped that theForeign Secretary would be able to conduct a general review ofthe factors affecting the supplies of the various commodities,but unfortunately by the time he reached the. U.S. A. , the Wheatcrisis was so serious that it was only by concentrating hiswhole efforts on that critical issue that he was able to safe-guard the United Kingdom position.3.      We are now facing some of the difficulties on the other commodities which we foresaw at that time, as well as thecontinued cereals difficulty.(a)    Meat.   I have  just had to reduce the amount of carcase meat in the weekly meat ration to 1/-.    I can only maintain itat this level if I can obtain before the end of June 61 ,000tons of meat from U. S.A.    The supplies, are available, but atthe moment the United States authorities, are not prepared tomake more than 12,000 tons available to us in the first quarterof the year.    We can get no information as to prospective al-locations for the second quarter of the year.    If we. are toaccept this position, a further cut in the carcase meat rationis inevitable.ib)    Sugar.  The critical negotiations on the 19h.7 alloca-tions of sugar are now taking place in Washington.    The american administration is under considerable pressure from the Republicanism-lican Congress to remove all controls on sugar and to go backon their obligations to the United Kingdom and Canada under their contract for the purchase&apos; of Cuban sugar.    If we fail toget any Cuban sugar we shall, only obtain sufficient sugar fora h os.   ration.     It seems possible, however,  that my Directorof Sugar may be able to make some compromise agreement for1.9h7 which might permit us to make some slight increase on thepresent 8 oz. &quot;ration, but which will leave the 19h8 positioncritical..
(c) Wheat. As you know, we were successful in obtainingsmall but reasonably adequate allocations of wheat and flourin January and February.     Our present information is that; we.may not obtain any wheat at all from U. S.A.  in their March-allocations.    Our position is so precarious that we must fight   .hard for even a small allocation.(d) Coarse grains.  The Americans have a large surplus,of maize this year.    We need coarse grains urgently in orderto commence the rehabilitation of our livestock industry.    Iwould like to obtain at least 1  million tons, of D.8.  maizefor shipment this year.    I would like to open negotiations on.this as soon as possible.-(e) Oils, and fats.  The International Emergency Food council has not yet found it possible to agree on the allocation of oils and fats for 1947.    The main factor here is the desire of the americans to secure an inequitably large share of world supplies,mainly at our expense.Ending of International Allocations.4.      Those are the mean specific points, but the generalfactor behind all of them is the question of whether the.present method of international allocation of foodstuffs,is working in the interests of the United Kingdom.    It does,not ensure any stability of prices.    We are forced to payhigh market prices and I do not think that prices would risemuch higher for most of the commodities if we were buyingcommercially.    And we are not obtaining what I regard as afair share of the supplies.    The key to this is the changein U. 3. policy in relaxing most of the controls which operatedto our advantage.    I feel that we shall make no impression onthis serious situation, except by a personal discussion withMr.  Clinton midurson1 and the other members of the Internationa.!Emergency Food Council.Reasons for Visit5.      After careful consideration I feel that I ought to make,this visit as soon as possible.    The present intention is thatthe International Emergency Food Council should meet onJanuary 30th.    I believe that arrangements, could be made to.postpone the meeting until the following week, in which case could leave the United Kingdom on the Queen Elizabeth onJanuary 30th, and arrive in time for tho adjourned meeting.I would -prefer to do this rather than fly, because I wish to visit America in a v/ay which will not give rise to any sug-gestion of an immediate emergency in our affairs.6.      The issues are serious.    If we are unable to maintain thepresent meat and sugar rations we shall he rightly criticisedunless we can chow that we have done everything.    And the.effect of further cuts introduced so long after the war willhave catastrophic effects on the housewives.     That is why I wish to act -promptly.    We cannot afford to take the risk of allowing these  critical negotiations to drag on indefinitely.7.      I have sent a copy of this minute to the Foreign Secretary.(Signed) John Strachey24-th January, 1947
