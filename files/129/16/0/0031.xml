2*i rtANNEX    INOTE BY THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR PALESTINEWeakness of the Provincial Autonomy plan the attraction of the Provincial Autonomy plan isthat it could be carried out administratively without bringing into the arena the whole question of the continuance of theMandate.      It represents also the traditional preference ofBritish statesmen for the adaptation rather than the all-outsolution.      But it is this very character of adaptation that both sides in the dispute regard as a denial of their hopesand of  their rights.It is an admirable piece of administrative planning for a system of government in a country where politicalreasoning has any chance of success over pure nationalism.There is no chance of this in Palestine because the forces ofnationalism are accompanied by the psychology of the Jew,which it is important to recognise as something quiteabnormal and unresponsive to rational treatment,  and becauseArab politics have their raison d&apos;etre not in the field ofgovernment or administration but in the field of religion andnationalism only.The plan affords no satisfaction of aspirations andhopes, which have become wholly disconnected from anyquestion of efficiency of administration or services for thepeople.      This detachment he^s not received the notice itdeserves.      The expenditure of  22 million of taxpayers1 moneyannually with virtually no consultation with anyone representinthem (and by the most undemocratic form of Government nowexisting in the Empire) passes without much comment, whereas the murder of one Arab by one Jew may set the whole countryin a rage.      The problem Is thus (it cannot be said too often)entirely political,  and the question whether any particularsolution satisfies administrative technique or not must go into the background.      The political solution will certainly not fit administrative requirements.      It was in trying totinker and make it fit that the Woodhead Commission came totheir&apos; logical but lamentable conclusion;    the task is to find the political solution and adhere to it and to make all other requirements fit into if.Both sides want independence and will not be happytill they get it.      It is a legitimate aspiration that canin fact only be achieved- by Partition.      The  &apos; loss of territory&apos; must be balanced, by the fullest political freedom in what remains.      partition without independence (i.e.  theProvincial Autonomy Plan)  is an essentially unattractiveobjective.-Ih.  1. L7.
29 iis XANNEX note BY THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR PALESTINEOB Sections to the proposal to use theProvincial Autonomy scheme as transitionalto Partition over a period of 5 -years1. The essential requirements for the solution ofthe Palestine problem at this time are firstly urgency and secondly finality.3. The principal objection to the proposal above is that although the scheme holds the promise of finality,yet it is not final in itself.      It will almost certainly be unacceptable to both sides,  and even if it were acceptable to one or the other,  it leaves the way open forclaims and counter claims over a wide variety of questions,more particularly the Boundaries, which would certainly not reduce the tension and as time went on would more probably increase it.To the Arabs it will mean an opportunity tocontinue their preparations for organised violence whichare already progressing uncomfortably fast,  to the Jewsit will present a long period of time for the applicationof their well known pressure tactics to improve their position hacked by world propaganda and their illegalforces.3. The Arabs will resist any form of partition andat this time are not reads/- for resistance of a type whichcould not he quickly suppressed.       If partition is to he-introduced eventually,  in so far as Arab resistance isconcerned it would surely be better to deal with it once and for all proceeding resolutely direct to partition,than to have to suppress them once at the introduction ofthe transitional period,  and again when Partition properwas introduced five years later,   and they have had theopportunity of perfecting their organisation.4-. The scheme does not produce a solution to theproblem of the Jewish illegal Armed forces which will still remain in being to he used either actually,  or asa threat in the event of &quot;disagreement with the CentralGovernment.5. The whole problem of security would be extremelydifficult.      If the Central Government were responsiblefor law and order the provinces would be in a position topass contentious and irresponsible legislation without having to deal with resulting lawlessness.      On the otherhand if responsibility for law and order were handed overto the provinces,  the Central Government would not havethe power to deal with such things as raids from oneprovince into another or suppression of minorities  inthe provinces.
6. The proviso that the High Commissioner has thepower of veto on all Dills would place him in an unhappyposition.      The provincial legislatures will he encouraged to court popular opinion by passing laws which bearunfairly on a section of the community e.g.   the minority,or which do not fit  in with the structure of theGovernment.      The continuous use of the veto by theHigh Commissioner oannot fail to bring all the opprobriumon to his head,  while leaving the provincial legislaturesfree to continue in the same way.7. It is recognised that some of these disadvantageswould disappear were there a certain degree of co-operationbetween the Central Government,  the Arabs and the Jews.I regret to say that in the state of Palestine as it is  .now I see no hope whatever of such co-operation beingforthcoming on the basis of the Provincial Autonomy Plan.
