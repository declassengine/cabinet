In the case of provincial autonomy, the political arguments for so doingoutweigh any legal arguments.If a proposal for provincial autonomy were brought before the United Nations,  it- must presumably he presented inthe form of a draft trusteeship agreement.      In principle,  therewould he considerable support in the United Nations for the idea that Palestine ought to be put under trusteeship.      But it is,to say the least of it,  questionable whether we could secureapproval for a trusteeShip agreement on provincial autonomylines,  in view of the requirement under Article 79 of the Charterthat the terms of trusteeship &quot;shall he agreed upon by the statesdirectly concerned&quot;, because the Arab States would certainly havea claim to he states directly concerned,  and. they would not assentsOn. the other hand,  our political&apos; position would be strengthenedif we could show that we had brought our proposals &quot;before theUnited Nations.      We might,in fact,  secure a majority vote infavour of the policy we wished to follow,  and should thus have some degree of international backing for our policy even if wecould not obtain a formal trusteeship agreements.reign Office,  S. W. 1 .,13th January, 1 9n,7.
ANNEX(l)    It seems desirable to begin by giving a roughdefinition of two terms which it is necessary to employ in thequestions which have to be considered.      These terms are:-(i)      partition(ii)      Provincial Autonomy.(i)    Partition means the creation of two independent states in Pales tines one Jewish and one Arab and also, a Jerusalemenclave which will not be independent but would be retainedunder outside administration.      The outside administrationmight be administered by the United Kingdom, or a trusteeshipadministered by the United Nations  as a collectivity orconceivably some other form of shared, international administratio:(compare for instance Trieste).(Ii)    Provincial autonomy means the administrative divisionof Palestine into two provinces; one Jewish and one arab and. a Jerusalem enclave.      Each of the two provinces wouldhave wide powers of self government but the Central Palestineadministration would retain:(a) Overriding powers to ensure the fulfilment of the provisions of the Mandate  (for instanceArticle 18 with regard to non-discrimination and Article 21 with regard to antiquities).(b) The preservation of law and order includingthe police and the Courts and. administrationof justice (at any rate wholly to begin with,though there would be some possibility of it being transferred in whole or in part as things developed).(c) (Perhaps)  certain powers to ensure an equitable distribution of the revenues ofthe country&apos;&quot;.(d) Defence(e) Foreign relations.The Jerusalem enclave would be administered directly by the Central Government.      The Central Government ofPalestine would remain as at present under the control of theGovernment of the United Kingdom with a High Commissioner at its head.(2)    The questions are:-(i)    Could His Majesty&apos;s Government carry out Partitionwithout obtaining the agreement of the United Nations or of anyother body or state?(ii)    Could His Majesty&apos;s Government put into forceprovincial autonomy without obtaining the agreement of the-United Nations or any other body or state?
&apos;9 M 3-if,(iii)    If the answer to (ii)   is in the affirmatives couldHis Majesty&apos;s Government in putting into effect provincial autonomycouple (without&apos; obtaining the agreement of the United Nations orof any other body or state)  it with an undertaking that at theend. of a transitional period (of,  say, five years)   either ofthe provinces could become an independent state if that was clearly the desire of the population of the province inquestion.(3)    There are certain basic legal considerations which apply to all three of the above questions.      First,  there isno legal obligation to place any particular territory,mandated or other, under the United Nations Trusteeship system and the United Nations has no automatic  jurisdiction overthe future of Palestine merely by virtue of Its being amandated territory^      This is clear from Article 77 of the charter,      Paragraph 1 of that Article provides that the trusteeship System shall apply to such territories  in certain categories  (one of which is &quot;territories now under mandate&quot;)as may be placed thereunder by means of trusteeship agreements.Paragraph 2 of the same Article re-enforces this by saying:-&quot;It will he a matter for subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing categorieswill he brought under the trusteeship system and uponwhat terms&quot;.Secondly, Article 80, paragraph 1, of trie Charter (q,. v.)provides in effect that, except as may be  agreed upon in individual trusteeship agreements, nothing in the Charteralters any existing international instruments.      Clearly thePalestine mandate is one of the existing internationalins truments.Some United: Nations Members  (notably U.S.S.R. )  haveargued that,  (notwithstanding Article 77), paragraph 2 ofArticle 80 imposes sun obligation on Mandatory Powers to placemandated territories under trusteeship.      (This provisionstates  that -paragraph 1 of Article 80  (mentioned above)  shallnot be interpreted, as giving grounds for delay or postponement of the negotiation and conclusion of agreements for placingmandated and other territories under trusteeship).      Suchan argument however is self-destructive.      One of the categories of &quot;other territories&quot;  to which the trusteeship system may be applied (see Article 77)  is &quot;territoriesvoluntarily placed under the system by states responsible fortheir administration&quot;.,      Clearly paragraph 2 of Article 80cannot impose art obligation to place territories in thatcategory under trusteeship;    and since paragraph 2 ofArticle 80 makes no distinction between mandated and other territories, it cannot impose such an obligation in respect ofmandated territories.      Paragraph 2 of Article 80 must be read subject to Article 77 and must mean that,  once a decision has been taken to place any particular territory underTrusteeship5  the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 80^affordno excuse for delay in completing the necessary negotiations inrespect of that territory.Further, at the League of Nations Assembly inApril, IQI46, Lord Cecil on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United. Kingdom made a declaration in the following
terms: -&quot;The future of Palestine cannot be decided until theAnglo-American Committee of Enquiry have rendered their &apos;report but until the three African territories have actually been placed under trusteeship,  and until fresh arrangements have been reached in regard to Palestine - whatever those arrangements may be - it is the  intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom to continue to administerthese territories in accordance with the general principlesof the existing mandates.&quot;The League Assembly itself passed,  withoutdissentient vote,  and with the  supporting votes of all theMandatory Powers,  a Resolution which contained the followingpa ssage:-&quot;The Assembly,Takes note of the expressed intentions of theMembers of the League now administering territories under mandate to continue to  administer them for thewell-being and development of  the peoples concerned inaccordance with  the obligations contained in therespective Mandates,  Until other arrangements have beenagreed between the United Nations and the respectiveMandatory Powers.&quot;(h)    Question 1 .      In as much as Partition involves thecreation of two independent States,  i,e,  the cessation of -administration by the Mandatory power in the areas madeindependent, partition could not be said to be a continuanceof administration in accordance with the obligations containedin the Mandate.      Partition would therefore conflict with theundertaking given at the League of Nations Assembly and withthe League Resolution quoted above,  under which we are already committed to obtaining the  Agreement of  the United Nations forany policy which involves a departure from the provisions ofthe Mandate.Moreover,  apart altogether from the undertaking tothe League of Rations,   it must be remembered that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment acquired the Mandate for Palestine under conditionswhich clearly made it necessary to obtain the assent of theCouncil of the League of Nations for any change such aspartition (see on this point Article 27 of the Mandate)  andin fact when Partition was recommended by the Peel&apos; Commissionin 1937s His Majesty&apos;s Government went to the Council of theLeague for its. approval.      The Council of the League hasdisappeared.      This disappearance, however, does notnecessarily imply legally that His Majesty&apos;s Government are thus free to do -what they wish with regard to Palestine withoutthe assent of anybody else.      Politically at any rate,  thereis much to be said for the view that,  with the disappearance of the League of Nations,  the assent of U.N.O.   should be soughtand support for such a view is found in the fact that the Unionof South Africa brought the question of the future of SouthWest Africa before the United Nations.Further in the case of TransJordan, which was part ofthe area covered by the Palestine Mandate,  His Majesty&quot;sGovernment did announce to the United Nations their intentionto; recognise Trans Jordan &apos;s independence, and obtained a unanimous favourable resolution from the General Assemblybefore negotiating the Treaty of Alliance.      Moreover,  after a G   a&apos;  i &quot;3- .    -
the Treaty had been signed and published,  but before it wasratified and came into force,  they obtained a similarfavourable resolution from the League of Nations Assembly.The Transjordan case therefore is no precedent for unilateral action in respect of any part of Palestine proper.Finally,  the position of the Jerusalem enclave mustbe considered and as stated in paragraph 1  above this enclavemight under partition be administered in three different ways of which one is some form of trusteeship:    if any form of trusteeship were contemplated for the -residual portion ofPalestine - i.e.  the &quot;Jerusalem enclave&quot; - it would be essential to submit a trusteeship agreement to the United^ations.      In  that case,   it would be  impossible to avoiddiscussion of the policy as a whole bj the United Nationssince the United Nations could not consider the merits of the limited trusteeship proposal except in relation to the widerproblem.      If  the Jerusalem enclave were not to be placed under trusteeship this point would not arise on strictly legalgrounds:    but for political reasons (set out in paragraph 5below),  there would be the  severest criticism in the united nations Organisation if His Majesty&apos;s Government continued to administer this enclave otherwise than under trusteeship andit would be impossible to prevent the matter being raised.(5)    Question 2.  .   The essential difference between&quot;provincial autonomy&quot; and &quot;Partition&quot; is  that provincial autonomy does not  involve the cessation of administration ofany part of Palestine (excluding Transjordan) by the existingMandatory Power,      It does not therefore give rise to thesame difficulties of conflict with Article 80 of the Charteror the League of Nations Resolution.      The United kingdom could continue to implement the obligations of the Mandateunder the &quot;Provincial autonomy&quot;  scheme because it will retainsufficient legal powers to do so.      Further Article 2 of theMandate provides that the Mandatory is to place the country under such political etc.  conditions as will Secure theestablishment of the Jewish National Home and the developmentof self-governing institutions and Article 3 goes on to saythat the Mandatory shall encourage local autonomy so far as circumstances permit.      Clearly provincial autonomy is directlyin accordance with Article 3 and with the development of self-governing institutions referred to in Article 2.      If thereare any objections the principe.1 ones would be: -(a) that  insufficient provision has been made for theJewish National Home;    or(b) that so much has bean given to  the Jewish national home that insufficient is left to fulfil theobligation of  safeguarding the civil and religiousrights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine.Although the area available for the Jewish national home would henceforth be limited to the JewishProvince,  the Mandate does not in fact provide that the whole of Palestine  is to be given up tothe Jewish National Home,  although the Jews haveargued to the contrary.      paragraph 2 of the preamble refers to a Jewish National Home inPalestine.
$ i 9-il. fe&amp;The answer to the Arab argument would &quot;be that their civil and religious rights as inhabitants of Palestine wouldbe safeguarded by the fact that one province of Palestine isan Arab province and in  the Jewish province His Majesty&apos;sGovernment retain over-riding powers to ensure that there isno discrimination on grounds of race,  religion or longuagethere (see Article 15).and that their civil and religiousrights are preserved (second paragraph of the Preamble and.Article 2).      Article 6 refers in addition to the rights and position of other sections of the population and it was onthe word &quot;position&quot; that His Majesty&apos;s Government based theircontention that it was necessary to control Jewish immigration.If Jewish immigration into the Jewish province (which will contain a large Arab minority) is not to be controlled, HisMajesty:&apos;s Government would have to contend, that the position(which includes the political position) of the Arabs is&quot;&quot;secured, by the existence of an Arab province.      There wouldappear,  therefore,  to be probably no legal necessity to consult the United. Nations before putting into effect thescheme of &quot;provincial autonomy&quot; - unless it were proposedto place all or any part of Palestine und\er Trusteeship.Nevertheless there are strong political reasons why it would, he extremely difficult to defend &quot;the continuance ofBritish aofninistration in Palestine except under trusteeship.At the recently concluded Session of the United nations general Assembly in New.&apos; York the U.S.S.R.  and some of theirgroup commented adversely upon the fact that no trusteeship agreements had. yet been submitted in respect of South WestAfrica, Nauru and Palestine.      The Chinese Delegationtabled, a draft Resolution reminding the Mandatory Powers ofthe United. Nations Resolution of February 19u7  (which invitedthem to submit trusteeship agreements for their Mandated,territories preferably not later than  the second Part of the   ,First Session) and urging them again to submit agreements inrespect of these three outstanding territories.      This,however, was not discussed and. died a natural death.      SouthAfrica&apos; s proposal to terminate the mandatory regime in SouthWest Africa by incorporation of the territory into the union was very bitterly attacked, and found only one supporter -the United Kingdom.      In the end a Resolution was passedinviting the Union Government to submit a trusteeship agreement in respect of South West Africa.      In regard toNauru the Australian Government repeated, an earlier promise to submit a trusteeship agreement as soon as possible.      TheUnited Kingdom will be in a most unenviable position if thefuture of Palestine,  the most important internationally ofall the mandated, territories,  alone among them is not brought before the United. Nations at all.      Our reputationin trusteeship matters was, frankly, not improved by our support of South Africa as a result of which we are almostuniversally suspected of annexationist tendencies.      Thiswill tell against us if we do not produce a trusteeship agreement for Palestine or a proposal for independence.      Wecould, not avoid, the Palestine question being raised by others either in the General Assembly or (what might be evenmore embarrassing)  in the Security Council even if we did  .not bring the matter forward ourselves, and it is at least -worth considering whether we might not make our positioneasier by taking the initiative ourselves.      There areadmittedly many and great practical difficulties about the submission of a trusteeship agreement for all or any part ofPalestine.      Indeed,  it seems most unlikely that we could,obtain agreement of the &quot;States directly concerned&quot; on any
terms of trusteeship or perhaps  even reach agreement on the identity of the &quot;States directly concerned&quot;.      but these difficulties are matters for separate consideration and are not immediately relevant to the question at present under examination.      To sum up, there would seem to he no legal necessity for consulting the United Nations in regard,to provincial autonomy unless trusteeship is proposed:      huton political grounds it would he extremely difficult toavoid reference to the United Nations either on our own initiative or on that of hostile critics.(6)    Question 3*      This question is of practicalsignificance only if the answer to question 1 is in the negative as well as the answer to question 2 being in the affirmative.      Clearly, if Partition, involving the grantof indexoendence to certain areas were legally possible now,without the agreement of the United Nations, a promise ofsuch partition at a later date would equally be legallypossible.      Assuming, however, that the answer to question 1is in the negative it would seem to follow (for the samereasons as lead tc that negative answer)   that an undertaking to grant independence at a later date could not be given without the agreement of the United Nations.      On the otherhand, an undertaking to make a recommendation to the united nations in the sense proposed at the appropriate time wouldnot seem to raise any legal difficulties.S U IVI M A R Y(7) - To sum up, it is considered that, for the reasonsstated, His Majesty&apos;s government cannot partition Palestinewithout the consent, previously obtained., of the united nations.      Nor can they, without such consent, give anyunconditional promise in connection with any other policy that partition will he effected at some future date if one orother of the communities in Palestine desire it.His Majesty&apos;s Government can probably as a matterof strict law introduce provincial autonomy without the priorconsent of the United Nations, though this view would not beuncontested.      But in that event they would immediately come under strong pressure from the United Nations to bringPalestine under the Trusteeship S3rstem and to submit aTrusteeship Agreement for approval.      This pressure would be-very difficult to resist.      Discussion of a trusteeship agreement would, of course, raise the whole question ofPalestine policy.Moreover,  it is probable  that,  immediately on theannouncement of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention to giveeffect to the provincial autonomy plan, an appeal would hepreferred by the Arab States either to the General Assembly,or to the Security Council on the ground that a situation had arisen which might lead to international friction or give riseto a dispute.      Such an appeal could hardly be disposed ofwithout a full discussion of Palestine policy.It thus appears that, whatever course His Majesty&apos;sGovernment adopt,  it is  impossible to avoid a ddscussion ofPalestine policy by the united Nations in the near future.
