S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.   2P\CP. (4-7) 571st February,   1947CABINETSOCIALISATION OF THE GERMANBASIC industries memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsRECOMMENDATIONSI recommend to my colleagues the following proposals;(a) Socialisation, should be applied to the followingfour industries in the British Zone, namely,  coal,  iron andsteel, heavy engineering,  and chemicals.(b) Custodians should he appointed at once on behalfof the German people in each Land where the industries inquestion are situated, pending transfer to public  ownership.These custodians should be appointed at once for the coal,and iron and steel industries,  and at a later stage forselected undertakings  in the heavy engineering and chemical industries.(c) Interim German Advisory Committees with purelyadvisory functions only should tie established at once inthe case of the coal and iron and steel industries throughoutthe British Zone.(d) In the case of heavy engineering and chemical industries,  the 0ommander-in-Chief should assume control as a preliminary step,  and the appointment of custodiansand the establishment of advisory committees should be postponed pending a clearer definition,   in consultationwith the Germans, of the undertakings within these industries to be covered by public ownership.(e) An announcement In the terms of Annex Q shouldbe made by the Commander-in-Chief immediately following theadoption of this paper.(f) A decision on the exact form which socialisationand public ownership shall ultimately take should be postponed until after the Council of Foreign Ministers has met in Moscow.      Meanwhile no steps should be taken whichwill prejudice the ultimate form of socialisation andownership in favour of their establishment on a zonal orCentral Government basis.
DISCUSSION1. At the 98th meeting of the Cabinet held on19th November;  1946,   it was agreed that as a first stepGerman custodians should be appointed who would hold the custody of the assets of the principal industries of the ruhr.      These industries have been previously.defined as coal,  iron and steel,  heavy engineering and chemicals.At  the 105th meeting of the Cabinet held on 12th December,1946,  it was pointed out that while the Cabinet had approved the proposals for the socialisation of the principal industries within the North Rhine/Westphalia Land therewere arguments in favour of socialising these industriesthroughout the British Zone of Germany.      It was decidedthat further proposals on this point should be submittedto the Cabinet in due course.      The following factual information regarding the geographical disposition of thei rid u s tries i a q u e s t i on is re Is va nt: -CoalThere are only two small mining areas outsidethe Land North Rhine/Westphalia and theircombined production amounts to less than2 million tons a year.Iron and Steelhen the major steel producing plants whichare to be thrown up for reparations havebeen removed,  of the remainder approximately80&quot;$ will be situated in the Land NorthRhine/Westphalia.      The residue is distributed generally throughout LowerSaxony,  in which province is also situatedthe majority of the iron ore mines.Heavy Engineer ink.and Chemicals.concentration of chemical industries isRhine/Westphalia these the motheAlthough the heaviestthe engineering and found in Northindustries fort part,  are distributed throughoutitish Zone.Moreover,  on accountof the extensive range covered by these industries socialisation is considered tohe a practical step only in the case of selected und e r t a k.i ngs.2. Considerable further study has been given to  thequestion whether the  industries in each Land should &quot;be vested in public ownership under each Land Government or whetherpending the  establishment of a Central German Government the ownership should he vested in one public authorit^r operatingthroughout the Zone.       It  is clear that If the latter coursewere adopted now this would necessarily imply that when a central Government was set up industries should come under it rather than under the Land Governments.      If once asystem of public ownership has teen set up embracingindustries in more than one Land it would be most difficultlater to split the industries again into their Landcomponents.       The detailed arguments in favour of the Landsolution are set out In Annex A.      The arguments seemoverwhelming but I do not ask for any final decision onthis point now in case developments at the Moscow Conferencemay bring new arguments into play.      I recommend strongly,
however, that the immediate step of the appointment ofcustodians which it is proposed to take should not involvethe principle of public ownership at a higher level thanthat of the Land.3. In view of the concentration of coal and ironand. steel industries in the North Rhine /Westphalia Land itmight have been suggested that socialisation should havebeen confined to this Land.      I do not recommend this coursepartly because it would leave the industries outside thisLand in an uncertain and ambiguous position?    partly becauseif we do this the Russians might then be able to claim that we were taking special measures with regard, to the ruhr and that they ought therefore to have some say inour arrangements.      If, on the other hand, we apply thesame measures in all the Laender of the British Zone theywill not be able to make this claim as we shall merely becarrying out an administrative policy in our Zone onexactly the same footing as they have carried out,  e.g.,land reform,   in their Zone.4. It is recommended therefore that the programme for socialisation should be as follows:(a) Coal.      Coal interests in each of the Laenderof the British Zone.(b) Iron and Steel.      Iron and Steel undertakingswithin the permitted level in each of theLaender of the British Zone.(c) Heavy Engineering and Chemicals.      Selectedundertakings in each of the Laender of theBritish Zone.In the case of heavy engineering and chemical industriesit will he necessary as a first step for the Commander-in-Chief to take into his control the selected undertakings and in making: the selection it is considered desirable toobtain German technical advice.proposals, The proposals are divided, into two phasesPHASE I.       The selection and appointment ofGerman custodians.       In the case of theHeavy Engineering and Chemical industriesafter assumption of control by the Commander-in-Chief and definition of the units to heincluded in the plan.PHASE II.      The appointment of German InterimAdvisory Committees,CUSTODIANS6.       (a)    Responsibilities.      Since the object of selectingthe custodians as an initial measure of socialisation is primarily of pyschological and political significance it isproposed that the selections should he made on a political
rather than a functional &quot;basis.      The object of appointingcustodians is primarily to make it clear that the industries in question would in due course be owned by the germans themselves and representatives selected for these duties should be persons who would enjoy the confidence of theGerman people.      Their powers necessarily would be limited.Title would not pass to them hut they would have the rightto ask for information on all aspects of the particular industry to which they have been appointed and would beexpected to provide a source of consultation and advice to Military Government.(b) Selection.      Consultation has  already taken place with the Land Governments about the selection of custodians.It will he necessary to carry out further consultations todraw up a final list as soon as the Cabinet have given their approval to the principles recommended in this paper.      Itis recommend eel that three custodians should, be appointed,for each industry in each Land, in which any part of an industry is located.      (It will be useless to appointcustodians for the coal industry in Schleswig-Holsteinsince no part of the industry exists in that Land. )      Thecustodians should,  as far as possible,   include one representative each from the S;P.D. , C.D.U.  and. theappropriate Trade Union.(c) Appointment.       Gorman custodians of the coal andiron and steel industries would he appointed immediately.The advice of the law officers has been taken with regard .to the use of the terms &quot;custody^ and &quot;custodian&quot;  in a legal instrument such as an ordinance under which it hadbeen proposed, that they should be appointed.      It appearsthat this presents some legal difficulty and it is accordingly proposed that the custodians- should, be appointedby a proclamation by the Commander-in-Chief.      This fallsclearly within the administrative powers of the Commander-in-Chief and. would not give rise to any legal difficulty.At the same time an announcement would be made to theGerman people;    drafts of the proclamation and announcementare attached, as Annexes B and C.FORMATION OF GERMAN INTERIM ADVISORY COMMITTEES .7. German Interim Advisory Committees would be setup through consultation with the appropriate custodians.The principle on which these Committees would be formed willbe as followst-ChairmanIndependent nomination preferablywith financial Qualifications.Deputy Chairman) rand 3 members    ) - vi2 Trade Union )Representatives)wn from the industry the 2 Trade Union representatives would be appointed in consultationwith&apos;either the appropriateindustrial union, or the ZonalTrade Union organisation or both.The Advisory Committees Will derive their authority from and at the discretion of,  the British Control Staffsappointed to each industry.       Initially these committees will be advisory in character, pending final decisions onthe form of public ownership to be adopted.
TIMING8.      (a)    The appropriate announcement and the appointmentof custodians to the coal and iron and steel industries would he made following approval of this paper as soonas the custodians have &quot;been finally selected,.(h)    In consultation with the custodians,  theformation of Interim Advisory Committees for the coal and iron and steel industries.      As the custodians willhave been appointed after consultation with the land governments and will represent the main political viewpointsthey would be regarded as comprising authoritative and sufficient sources of German advice for this purpose.U.S.  REACTIONS9. It has been agreed that we should go forward withour policy of socialisation regardless of American reactions.Ministers,  however, will be aware of the statement made byGeneral Clay to the  effect that objections would he raised to our policy unless it were manifestly the will of theGermans themselves..      Since the German Land Governments will no doubt make some form of declaration on the announcementof these measures by the Commander-in-Chief, we have madeiriformal soundings as to what these reactions are likelyto he and it is probable that even in North Rhine/Westphaliathe German Land authorities will endorse our action by amajority or may even anticipate us by a demand for implementation, of the policy already announced.      On22nd January the K.P.D. , S. P. D. ,  and C.D.U.   each proposedresolutions on the subject to the Landtag of N. Rhine-Westphalia.       The C..U.U.   only differed from the S.P.D.in that they wished for some participation in these industries by private enterprise.      It is probable thatwhen the subject comes up again in the first week ofFebruary,   the left wing of the C.P.U.  will force their part to support socialisation.We do not, therefore,  in any event,  anticipate any difficulty with the UVS.  Element which might otherwise have embarrassed,   even temporarily,   the bi-zonal arrangement.E.B.Foreign Office,  3.W.1.1st February,  1947.
ANNEX APUBLIC OWNERSHIP UNDER LAND OR CENTRAL GOVERNMENTThe arguments which seem to me to point clearlyagainst any solution other than that of putting the industries under Land Governments are as follows:Prom the purely economic point of view it is argued -quite rightly - that  a socialised industry should he run witha maximum degree of efficiency and to the .maximum benefit toa nation as a whole.      In order to achieve this the industry must &quot;be nationalised and placed under the direct control ofthe ultimate source of power in the State, which is theCentral Government.Trie fallacy in this argument,  however,   is that itassumes that the nationalisation of the Ruhr industries isan end in itself,   intended for the purpose of securing forthe German people the greatest possible benefit from thisvast economic force by exploiting it in the most efficientway possible through the machinery of direct Stats control.In point of fact,  however,  our original object was,  and mustbe,   precisely the reverse;    namely,  to keep the futureCentral German Government as weak and harmless as possible from the military and political point of view notwithstanding the fact that the Ruhr industry with all its potentialitiesfor evil if misused is  situated within the territory of theGerman State.      It was with this object in view that aftervarious other methods (e.g.  creation of a Ruhr State separated from Germany;    inter-allied consortium to own and work the ruhr industry)  had been examined and rejected,  it was eventually decided that    the best means of ensuring that theGerman military leaders and the Ruhr industrialists in combination with the German Government should   not again beable to exploit the Ruhr industries for military purposes and against the interests of the world would be the creation of aspecial Ruhr/Westphalia Land in the Government of which the ruhr industry should be vested subject to strict allied control.If the future Central German Government weredirectly to own and control the Ruhr industry,  this would havethe effect of increasing its power in Germany and throughoutthe world.      This is precisely what we want to avoid.      Ifthis wars to  happen our last state would be worse than our first.      There is no reason to suppose that in administeringthese industries as owners,   the future Central GermanGovernment would be any more moral or internationally-mindedthan were Krupps before the war.      AH we should have achievedwould be to increase for the German Government the temptationsand opportunities to  resume their pre-war policy of aggression by giving them direct,  instead of as before the war indirect,control of this great industry.Nor must we forget a possible further misuse of the ruhr industries by a future German Government.      In additionto producing the armaments needed for aggression,  these industries could be used to capture those foreign marketswhich are of vital interest to the British export trade andtherefore to the very life of this country.
It was precisely to guard against this doubledanger that we created the large Land North Rhine/Westphalia,in the Government of  which should he vested the socialised industries.      This comparatively weak government would be moreunder the influence of the&apos; Allies   than any German CentralGovernment and would he more amenable to international controland. if necessary to pressure by an international forcestationed in the Ruhr.      Moreover, such a Government, notbeing the German Government charged with the destinies of theGerman people, would not be tempted in the some way to misuseits power in order to develop the Ruhr Industries on&quot;patriotic11 lines.It has been objected that the Land. Government will&quot;be predominantly C.D.U.  and therefore out of sympathy withsocialisation,  but this may turn out to be equally true ofthe Central German Government when this is eventually set up,and if at. any time it becomes necessary to bring pressure to hear on a non-socialist Government it would be easier to do soon a weak Land Government than on a powerful Central GermanGovernment.      The ultimate sanction in &quot;both cases will hethe presence of Allied forces of occupation in the Ruhrterritory;    but even so it will be much easier to applymilitary sanctions to a Land Government by gripping, with military force if need be,  the vital points in theNorth Rhine/Westphalia province,  than to a Central GermanGovernment which con only in the last resort be brought toheal by an Allied march upon Berlin.      This may in practiceonly be a technical distinction, but psychologically it is a distinction of great importance in politics when it comes to the point ox taking forcible action.If the Ruhr industries are put under a CentralGovernment, the powers left to the North Rhine/WestphaliaLand- will in practice be quite illusory as the CentralGovernment would be able to control everything that matteredin the Land by controlling trie  industries.   .   This would go far towards destroying our whole conception of a decentralisedconstitution with real and effective powers in the hands ofthe   Laender.      It may be argued against    this that it willin any case he necessary to give to the Central Governmentwide powers for the allocation of row materials    and for general trade policy which will involve a considerable measure ofcontrol over the industries.      It would therefore be unrealif the industries did not  also belong to the Central Government.In fact,  this argument seems to weigh far more in the ptherdirection.      If,  as seems likely,  it is found necessary togive such powers to the Central Government . that&apos; is all themore reason why it should not  also own  particular&apos;industries.It will be able to carry out its task of allocation,  etc.,in a far more objective and impartial manner and without-such a dangerous concentration of pov/er if it is not at thesame time in the position of an industrial owner.The attitude of the French and of    the smallerWestern Allies is most important.      The French,  as is wellknown,  have persisted in pressing for the complete politicalseparation of the Ruhr from Germany which they regard as essential for their own security.      We.have agreed that thisis impossible, but If we are to prevent the French from becoming entirely disillusioned with our German policy and
therefore with the prospects of close relations with us, wemust offer them some constructive alternative as near aspossible to their original conception.      To put the ruhr industries under a Central German Government would be as faras it is possible to go from French ideas.      Such a proposal would have a profound effect on the whole of French policyand on their general attitude towards us.&apos;      On the other &quot;hand,they have shown some signs of realising that their originalplan is new impracticable and we have reason to believe thatthey would fall in cpjite readily with a proposal that theindustries should be vested in public ownership under theLand Government and subjected to international  control whenthe general occupation of Germany came to an end.      The Dutch-attitude is strongly against placing the Ruhr Industries undera Central German Government.      They realise that socialisationoi the basic industries under a Land Government is not nearly so objectionable from the security point of view and in their memorandum -which they hove just  submitted to the Deputiesof the Council of Foreign Ministers they expressly distinguish between socialisation&apos; under a Land Government,  as being inaccordance with a policy of decentralisation,  and nationalisa-tion under a Central German Government which leads direct tothe recreation of a  powerful central German State.       I believethat the Belgians share these views.In spite of  the difficulty of reconciling theselong-term security considerations.with immediate efficiencyrequirements it is none-the-less necessary to do so and I am satisfied that  it can be done if on the one hand we decidenow that custodians should be appointed on a Land basis andif on the other hand we set up advisory boards as a temporary expedient to to Ice within their sphere the whole of each industry in the British Zone.      It should be our object thatin    due course managerial responsibility should also besplit between the Laender.      But I would not wish to insist that this should be done at once if,   as I understand may hethe case,  it would lead to loss of efficiency in thepresent emergency period.      The question should,  however,be reserved for further .consideration later.
ANNEX BDRAFTPROCLAMATIONAPPOINTMENT 01* GERMAN CUSTODIANS OF certain industries .......____............__Whereas the principal &quot;business enterprises ofthe  industries  included in the schedule to&quot;this proclamationhave from time to time &quot;been taken under control, hy military government hy certain, general orders and notices ofassumption of  control made pursuant  to Military GovernmentLaw No.   53 and whereas  it is the intention of military government to reorganise, such industries  in accordancewith the economic needs of the British Zone of Germanyand whereas  the advice and assistance of representativeGermans is required by Military Government for thatpurpose now I CommanderAin-Ghref and Military Governor ofthe British Zone of Occupation in Germany hereby announceas follows1. Military Government will by notices of appointmentpursuant to this proclamation appoint three German custodiansin respect of each of the said industries in each Land ofthe British Zone in. which such industries are situated.2. It will be the duty of the custodians to study the industry In respect of which they are appointed and toprovide a source for consultation and. advice to theappropriate Military Government Authorities in any matterr e 1 a11ng t o s u&quot; ch indus try.      Thc c us to d ia ns w 111 b eentitled to ask for full information In regard to all matters concerning such. Industry and to make recommendations for the reorganisation thereof in accordance with theeconomic needs of the British Zone.      When tendering adviceor   making recommendations the custodians of each industryin each Land will act jointly unless Military government shall otherwise direct.      The functions and responsibilities of the custodians will be set out  in the directives whichwill be given to them &quot;by Military Government.
Announcement to be made by the commander-in-chiefto the land governments on the appointment opcustodians to the coal and iron and steel industries in the british zone1. I have cone here to talk with you about the plans for the reorganisation of the German coal and iron and steel industries and to inform you of the steps which my Governmenthas now decided to take in that connection.      I am aware thatthere has been some uncertainty in the minds of the Germanpeople on this subject and I am confident that the measuresabout to be taken will assist materially in removing thisuncertainty and thus get rid of what may be a psychologicalobstacle to the production of those basic materials whichare so essential to the proper functioning of German and european industrial economy.2. As you are aware,  in my capacity as Coramander-in-Chief and Military Governor of the British Zone,  I have takeninto my control at different times the coal industry andiron and steel industry throughout the British Zone.      Intaking these steps I have always made it clear that the undertakings involved would never be returned to their original German owners or to the control of those who have so tragically misused their powers in the -past.3. The time has now come when my Government wishes totake a further step towards the final solution of this important problem, which,   in their view,  as has alreadybeen announced,  lies in public  ownership.      I am here to-day to acquaint you of this next step.      It is my governments intention to appoint to the coal and iron and steel industries in the British Zone,  German custodians on thebasis of three such custodians  to  each of the industries inquestion in each Land in which such Industries are situated.After consultation with prominent members of the land governments my Government is selecting the names of Germancustodians for these important duties.      These custodianswill provide to Military Government a source of advice and consultation which will be of great value in resolvingthis complex and vital task.      The names of these Germancustodians will be announced shortly.4. It is perhaps unnecessary that I should point out,but desirable in order to avoid any misunderstanding,  thatthe assumption of custody by German nominations will in no way modify the rights and obligations which the Allies have assumed under the Potsdam Agreement.      It should also benoted that the responsibilities of custodians will be confined to the custody of the assets of the two industries concerned.      Their appointment will not affect,  for thetime being,  the ownership of title or existing rights orliabilities in the undertakings concerned.5. In consultation, with the German custodians soappointed,  it is the  intention to form Interim AdvisoryCommittees for each of the two industries, such Committeesincluding experts  in each particular industrial field,  andalso representation from the- Trade Unions,
6. The appointment of custodians and the subsequentestablishment of Interim Advisory Committees will not of itself determine the question of the ultimate ownership ofthese industries  and many problems remain to be solvedbefore the final pattern for these basic industries emerges.For example3  there are    the questions of eventual compensation,of the value of the fixed assets,  of the claims of financialand other interests,  and of the final form and structure ofthe industries.7. The task is an immense one and will call for great efforts and close and willing co-operation.      In addition should be recognised that the appointment of custodiansto these vitally important German industries represents agreat step forward.       It should provide the German people and the workers in those industries with that assurancewhich they have felt in need of and which I am confidentwill act as a spur and a stimulus to increased, production,the securing of which will do more than any other one thing to put German industry on its feet and to restore a higher standard of life for the German people.
