(47) 83rd January, 1947CABINETFOOTBALL POOLSNote by the Lord chancellor on 16th December the Cabinet invited me to consider, in consultation withthe Home Secretary, whether it would be practicable to prohibit football pools bya Regulation made under the Supplies and Services (Transitional Provisions)Act, 1945.2. Under this Act there is no power to make a new Regulation. The power is limited to directing that an existing Regulation should have effect for one ofthe purposes mentioned in the Act, with or without variations. In my opinion,with which the Home Secretary concurs, there is no existing Regulation underwhich football pools could be abolished, even if the power to vary were exercised,and it would, therefore, not be practicable to prohibit football pools without legislation.J.House of Lords, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1947.
