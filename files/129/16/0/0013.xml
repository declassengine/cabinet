(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty government)SECRETCP.(47) 15DISTRIBUTION OF MINISTRY OF, FQOD&apos;S *l/HEATPURCHASES IN TURKEYMemorandum by the Secretary.,. of State for IndiaUnder existing arrangements the   Ministry of Foodprocures India&apos;s requirements of imported grain (e.g.Australian wheat and flour, Iraqi barley. Burma riee and united States flour) except in cases in which, it is more convenient for the Government of India to do their ownprocurement (e.g. Argentine maize and United Statescoarse grains).     This suits us as it prevents competition between ourselves and the Government of India and it also enables the Government of India to profit fromthe market experience of the Ministry of Food.2,     Under these arrangements&apos;the Ministry of Foodprocured some wheat and barley for India from Turkey last summer.     ,/hen more Turkish wheat became available andthe Government of India received offers direct throughtrade channels, they were persuaded to refrain from pursuing these offers by an assurance which I gave them,after consultation with the Ministry of Food, that theywould receive further quantities of Turkish wheat whenthe Ministry of Food made purchases.     The circumstances in which this assurance was.given are summarised in more detail in Appendix I.     In the event the Ministry of Foodbought in November a further l2b,000 tons of Turkish wheat and 24,000 tons of Turkish rye to be ready from Januaryonwards.     But the Minister of Food informs me that he proposes to bring the whole of the wheat to the UnitedKingdom, and give India only the rye though it is wheat which the Government&apos; of India need.3.     &apos;.7e have given the Government of India what is in my view a firm commitment to let them have at any rate asubstantial part of such purchases of Turkish wheat aswe were able to make.     Both the Government of India andthe Viceroy are now pressing me for information as to whenshipments will begin.      However serious the Minister ofFoodMs difficulties may be in feeding the United Kingdomand the Colonies, these do not justify a grave breach of faith on the part of H.M.G. towards India,     The results would be likely to be:-(a) an acrimonious&apos; public dispute with India which,particularly in view of the present serious shortageof wheat in India described in Appendix II, would4th January,. .1947.copy cabinet
-2-be likely to colour the atmosphere attending the closing days of British rule in India.     Sir John;   Colville, whom I consulted when he was acting asViceroy, expressed considerable concern at this,,(b) The existing tendency of the Government of Indiato procure their grain imports themselves will increase.     They may indeed cease altogether to depend on the Ministry of Food, for the procurementof their imported grain requirements and insteadcompete with us.     We might expect them to enterinto a series of barter transactions whereby theywould obtain grain in return for cotton and jutetextiles.     We would be at a d. isadvantage incompeting in Burma, the Middle East, Argentine andpossibly Australia on this basis and Indianexports of cotton and jute textiles might be diverted to these areas at the expense of moreneedy territories.     I do not see&quot;&apos;how we can prevent this except by showing the Government of india that It is to their advantage to procure ordinarily,through the Ministry of Food and this we could not continue to do if we break our obligations to the mover Turkish wheat.(c) The Government of India would be unlikely to be veryreceptive to a request which I have just made to themthat they should ask the I.M.F.C. to allocate theirexportable surplus of groundnuts and groundnut oilentirely to the United Kingdom and territories forwhich we are responsible.4.     I have pressed these considerations on .the Minister ofFood in correspondence but he is unwilling to alter his view.I must therefore bring the matter to the notice of theCabinet and suggest that:-(a) In addition to the 24,000 tons of Turkish ryeoffered by the Minister of Food, one half of the125,00-.- tons of Turkish wheat purchased should be allotted to India..(b) India&apos;s share or this wheat should all be shippedif possible in January, February and March in orderto help relieve the difficult wheat situation nowexisting in India, which is likely&apos;to continue untilthe wheat harvest of Northern India is availablein May.P.-L.&amp; Office, S.W.1.4th January, 1947.
appendix IMINISTRY OF &apos;FOOD&apos;S purchases in TURKEY__-In August the Ministry of Food bought 100,000 tons of turkish barley and 20,000 tons of Turkish wheat, practically all of which has been shipped to India.     At the outset theGovernment of India showed a desire to participate in thenegotiations in Turkey but were persuaded to refrain.2.     At the end of September the Government of India were asked, at the instance of the Ministry of Food, whether theywould wish the Ministry of Food to purchase for them further supplies of wheat or other cereals from Turkey for shiomentin the first quarter of 1947, even at the rather high prices at which the earlier quantities had been bought.      TheGovernment of India agreed.p3.    On 22nd October the Government of India informed H.Mthat they had received, through an Egyptian firm, an offer of 30,000 tons of Turkish wheat and sought our advieThey were informed in reply, on 24th October in India OfficeItelegram No. 18944, which was sent after consultation withthe Ministry of Food, that H.M.G. had sent a representative to Turkey to negotiate on the price of cereals, that meanwhile acceptance by the Government of India of theoffer which they had received might have a most unfortunate effect on prices and that ;&apos;further quantities of Turkish. wheat will be made available to India when the Ministryof Food start buying again&quot;.     There seems no question thatthis represents a definite commitment on the part of H.M.G.to give India a reasonable share of any further purchases  tof wheat which the Ministry of Food might succeed in.makingin Turkey.      The Government of India accordingly rejected the offer which they had received and also a further offer which they received through a Nairobi firm.4.     It is clear that the ministry of Food regardedthemselves as negotiating, at a:.y rate in part, for Indiabecause:-1(a) Telegram Amaze X.7928 of 6th November from theMinistry of Food to the British Food Mission,        . .Washington, stated that the Ministry of Food werenegotiating for a further 150,000 tons of wheat forI nd ia;(b) A letter dated 9th November from the Ministry ofFood to the India Office stated that &quot;India will of course receive a substantial quantity of anyfurther wheat or barley we may be able to obtain from Turkey, but I am afraid we cannot go so far asto give an assurance that all our purchases willbe- made over to India.&quot;5. Moreover,aReuter message from Istanbul dated 10th[November said that &quot;Britain is to buy in Turkey nearly,150,000 tons of grain for India under an agreement
-2-concluded by ilr. Somorvi 11 e-Smitti of the British Treasury &apos;with, the Turkish Government stated an Ankara report to-day&quot;.This indicates what the negotiators had in mind.6,     The purchases eventually made by the Ministry ofFood were for 125,COG tons of wheat and about 25,000 tonsof rye, delivery to be at the rate of 37,000 tons per month from 1st January 1947.      The Government of india were informed of this on 28th November and. told thatthe distribution of the quantities bought was underconsideration. &apos; .   Since then the Government of India havebeen pressing with increasing vigour for informationas to when they may expect their share of the purchasesto be shipped.     They have asked in particular that inorder to tide them over their immediate difficulties25,000 tons of Turkish wheat should be shipped in january and a further 25,000 tons in February.
APPENDIX IIINDIA&apos;S ,-mnT POSITIONTables are attached showing India&apos;s overall food position and the position in regard to wheat alone.    Itwill be seen from the first table that, thanks to strictprocurement and rationing arrangements in Southern India,the maintenance of imports and the movement of wheat from. India to supplement supplies available in SouthernIndia and Bengal, these&apos; latter areas have now reachedthe main rice harvest without the disaster which at onetime seemed likely.2.     On the other hand, the position as regards wheat, aswill be seen from the second table, is extremely difficult and is likely to remain so until the 1947 wheat harvestbecomes available next May.   At the end of January overallwheat stocks will be down to about one week&apos;s requirements and will be completely exhuasted during February.    Thewheat content of the 12 oz. cereals ration has beenreduced to 5.3/5 oz. a day in Bombay, 5.2/7 oz. In Calcutta,6 oz. in the western parts of the United Provinces and to5 oz, in the Eastern and Central parts of the united provinces.   It is about to be reduced in Delhi to S oz. aday.   The Government of India state that the consumptionof coarse grains as substituteshas already been pushedto the maximum.    Some substitution of rice for wheatwould be possible if rice were available, but overallGovernment-held rice stocks will not amount to more than about four weeks&apos; off take at the end of February.3.     The maintenance of the rationing system in India depends,of course, not on the total supplies of cereals availablethroughout the whole sub Continent, but on the amounthicli the various provincial and State Governments are[able to procure from time to time, either for consumptionlin their own territories or for transfer from surplus tolieficit areas,-t     The figures in the attached cables take into accountpn the import side 17,000 tons of Australian wheat to bepipped in January for February arrival.   They leavemit of account 17,000 tons in the U.. S. A. January programme&apos;or India as this will not reach India .before March.    NorPo they take into account the repayment of a loan ofJ5,000 tons of flour made by the Government of India, lastgrimier to aLFSEa, for which immediate repayment is asked,Ince it is now understood that the Ministry of Food -jjropose to repay this by deduction from the wheat which theyre procuring for India in Australia.&apos; The requirementstated include 70,000 tons of wheat needed in December/ebruary for the repayment of loans to the Punjab and Sim.fis fePay&apos;l&apos;;lent is necessary, not only in implementation offlaertakin..s given to these provinces by the Government ofJPiia, but in order to secure the rationing position inBJose Provinces.
5.     The Government of India have stated their wheatrequirements, assuming immediate repayment of their loan of 25,000 tons of flour to ALFSEA (wh.reas they will only receive 17,000 tons of wheat from Australia inFebruary against this repayment), as an additional 40,000cens for January arrival and a further 150,000.tons for february arrival.   It will cl arly be impracticable to give them this.   But the situation could be very materiallyrelieved by the shipment to India in January and Februaryof the maximum quantity of /neat on the relatively short haul from Turkey.
