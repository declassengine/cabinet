(47) 2510th January, 1947CABIMHTECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1947Report from the Ministerial Committee on Economic PlanningIntroductory1. We have considered tlhe Economic Survey for 1947, prepared by theEconomic Survey Working Party, and a covering memorandum by the steering committee. We agree with the Steering Committee &apos;s analysis of the presentposition and with the gravity of the situation disclosed by these two documents.We also agree with tlhe recommendations contained in the Steering Committee&apos;sReport, subject to qualification and amendment on certain points.2. As the Economic Survey and the Steering Committee&apos;s Report havealready been circulated to the Cabinet (CP. (47) 19 and 20), this Report can most conveniently take the form of a summary of the proposals in the steering committee&apos;s Report, as amended by us. Our main recommendations are side-lined.General3. There is, we agree, a great and increasing gap between productive resources and requirements. We are trying to do too many things, and the general shortage of labour is getting worse rather than better. If our resources are to beused in the best way, we must scrutinize our requirements and see which can be curtailed and postponed, and we must make sure that we do not start moreprojects than can be completed within a reasonable time.4. For the next two or three years our major problems are the balance ofpayments and the inflationary risks of a general excess of demand over supply.If either of these is neglected, the whole of our planning faces complete break-down.Balance of Payments5. We must achieve the 50 per cent, increase over the pre-war volume of exports in the second half of 1947 already decided upon by the Cabinet (CM. (46)94th Conclusions, 4th November, 1946) subject only to unforeseen circumstancesof such a nature as to compel reconsideration.6. This will be very difficult. The decline in production due to the shortageof fuel will mean that the required volume of exports will involve a heavierproportionate demand on total production. Where the maintenance of the samevolume of exports from a particular industry will bear too heavily on total production, export targets in other lines of production will have to be increased.7. We recommend that the Ministers concerned should immediately consider their export targets to make the necessary changes, and that an interdepartmental committee should be set up for this purpose by the President of the Board ofTrade.[32992]B
2Man-power8. The man-power gap at the end of 1947, on the basis of minimum require-ments presented by Departments in full knowledge of the stringency of the situa-tion, reaches the formidable figure of 630,000. Unless this gap can be substan-tially closed, either by an increase of resources or by deliberate reduction of requirements, it will close itself by random failures to meet requirements whichwill dislocate the whole course of production, and increase the existing stronginflationary pressure.9. Man-power for Armed Forces and Supplies. The Steering Committeeworked on the basis of requirements for the Armed Forces estimated at 1,385,000at the begininng of 1947, running down to 1,200,000 at the end of 1947. (this latter is the figure which it was first intended to reach by the end of 1946.) Tothis must be added the requirements of labour directly employed on the home-produced supplies and equipment for the Armed Forces, estimated at about530,000 throughout 1947. It must also be remembered that, besides the directrequirements, there is a substantial man-power force indirectly employed forthe purposes of the Armed Forces and their supply.10. The Steering Committee suggested as a target for consideration thatthe direct requirements of man-power for the Armed Forces and the supplyindustries at the end of 1947 should be reduced from 1,700,000 to 1,400,000.11. We note from D.0.(47)4 that the Minister of Defence now proposesfigures of 1,094,000 for the Services and 474,000 for production, making a totalof 1,568,000 at 31st March, 1948. Notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the Minister of Defence in his memorandum, our recommendation is that,in view of the seriousness of the economic situation, the Cabinet should now decide that the direct requirements of man-power for the Armed Forces and the supplyindustries must not exceed 1,400,000 at the end of 1947.12. Non-Industrial Civil Service. This now stands at 710,000. We are1seriously concerned about the heavy drain on man-power which this represents.A Committee of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary hasalready been appointed, by the Prime Minister to consider Civil Service man-power. But we regard it as indispensable that the total staffs in the CivilService should be reduced as far as is consistent with essential Government policy,and should make a substantial contribution to closing the man-power gap.13. Local Government. The number of local government officials is 800,000.We recommend that the Minister of Health, the Minister of Education and theSecretary of State for Scotland should be asked to take steps to make sure thatthe number of local governments staffs is not more than is required for the efficientconduct of necessary business. In particular, as and when functions are trans-ferred from local to central government (e,g.,. in connection with the hospitalscheme) there should be a corresponding declinein local government staffs.14. Employment of foreign labour:.--Fjvery effort should Be&apos; made to find employment for the Polish soldiers who are or will shortly be in this country,though we fear that it will be impossible to get more than lOOjOOO at the mostinto employment in 1947.15. The Minister of Labour is already taking active measures to this endwith the T.U.C. and is hopeful that good results will ensue. If satisfactory arrangements can be made to absorb Polish soldiers we think that later oh empltiy-ment could be found for labour from other countries, e.g^ displaced persons fromthe former Baltic States.16. Employment of women. As the man-power situation is so grave, andSin view of the serious shortage of women in certain industries, we recommehuI that the Cabinet should give consideration to a scheme on the following lines.117. The essence of the scheme is that, at any rate for a limited period,women on reaching the age of twenty should undertake a period of nationalservice which might be for two years.18. We do not suggest that women should be conscripted into the Services,but that they should be called upon to undertake a two years period of service in one&apos; of the occupations of national importance which are particularly suitablefor the employment of Women arid in which there is an acute shortage of labour.We have in mind in particular the textile industry or work such as the Womeri&apos;s land Army, nursing and domestic service in hospitals and similar&apos; institutions.
3    &apos; &apos; I   . - &apos; ; -19. Women who preferred to serve in the women&apos;s auxiliary forces wouldbe allowed to do so in so far as vacancies were available. There would, of course,have to be a limitation on the total numbers who could be taken into each category of employment. Those women who could not be offered jobs in the employmentof their choice would have to undertake such other work of national importance as was assigned to them.20. School-leaving age. The raising of the school-leaving age on 1st April,1947, means a direct loss to the national labour force which will reach 370,000by September 1948. From the man-power point of view this is a seriousdiminution of our resources at a time when the whole economy of the countryis badly over-strained.21. From the educational point of view it is, of course, undesirable thatthere should be any postponement of the arrangements already in train. Onthe other hand, the provision of the additional accommodation required will bea matter of considerable difficulty in certain areas. The Secretary of State forScotland drew attention to the position in Scotland in a recent memorandum to the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (46) 287), but has informed us that theposition has since somewhat improved. The Minister of Education, on the otherhand, took the view that the programme of construction could be largelycompleted by the relevant dates (L.P. (46) 295).22. We have decided to recommend to the Cabinet that the raising of theschool-leaving age should be postponed from 1st April until 1st September, 1947.In our view this step, which would involve legislation, is justified on a combina-tion of economic and educational grounds.23. The economic ground is that a postponement for five months will mean that an additional 160,000 boys and girls will be available for employmentin the latter half of 1947 in what will be a period of great man-power stringency.24. On educational grounds the justification is that -the postponement ofthe school-leaving age by five months will mean that, when the strain of theadditional numbers is felt in the schools the preparations, although even thennot wholly ready in all areas, will be much nearer completion.25. Neither the economic nor the educational argument can be pushed too far; and we wish to make it absolutely clear that in our view neither on educational nor on economic grounds would there be any justification for a post-ponement of the raising of the school-leaving age after 1st September, 1947,and this date must be accepted as final.Coal26. The Cabinet have recently considered the coal situation and havemade certain recommendations, dealing with the matter, mainly from the short-term point of view (CM. (47) 3rd Conclusions).27. Everything points to the shortage of coal being a continuing drag onour total production for the next three or four years, and everything possiblemust therefore be done to increase output. High priority must be given to whatever is needed to improve the mechanical equipment of the mines and thus to increase output.28. At present young men employed under ground are not called up foiservice in the Forces. We recommend that a decision should be taken and announced now to continue this arrangement for the next five years at least.This would prevent losses which the industry cannot bear, and would also induceyoung boys to enter the industry as they would thereby be reserved from calling up. But this arrangement would only be fully effective if as we recommend it is strictly confined to coal mining.29 We recommend that Polish labour should be employed in the form ofgangs for development work in the mines, thus freeing our own miners for current production.   (See also paragraphs 14 and 15.)30. Special efforts should be made to increase the provision of houses in mining districts earmarked for the use of miners themselves so as to attractnew adult recruits to the industry. This may require the use of some specialorganisation for building houses for miners. Consideration should also be givento allocating aluminium houses for this purpose.[32992] &apos; B 2
31.   We must press on with the conversion of engines and plant to oilburning.Povoer32. There is a serious shortage of generating plant which is likely to growworse in the next two years. There will almost certainly be nation-wide cutsin electricity supply in&apos; January and February, and the prospect is that thesecuts will have to be repeated in the winter of 1947-48 and of 1948-49.33. The steps to be taken to deal with the situation were considered by theCabinet on 7th January (CM. (47) 3rd Conclusions). At that meeting the coal committee were invited to consider the possibility of securing economies in domestic consumption of electricity. Further, the Minister of Fuel and Power,in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofSupply, was asked to examine and report on the steps which should be takento secure a sufficient supply of electricity generating plant over the next threeyears.34. In these circumstances it is unnecessary for us to repeat the reconnmen-dations covering these matters in the Steering. Committee&apos;s Report.Steel35. On certain assumptions, stated in the Steering Committee&apos;s Report,the total amount of steel required in 1947 to meet the man-power requirements in the engineering industries would call for an extra 690,000 tons of finished steel. No such increase can, however, be looked for. It follows that there wouldnot be enough raw material to absorb any increase above the present labour forcein the engineering industries, and everything possible must be done to prevent any further flow of labour into these industries.36. We recommend that the Ministers of Labour and Supply, in consulta-tion with the appropriate Engineering Councils, should be asked&quot; to consider what steps to this end they could usefully take. So far as woman labour is concerned,the position would be eased by the adoption of the measures proposed in para-graphs 16 to 19 which would draw women out of these industries.37. Given the continuing shortage of steel supplies and the basic importanceof steel in all industrial activity, we recommend that there should be a moredeliberately selective allocation of steel between the various industries than hasobtained hitherto, with the object of facilitating general economic adjustment.Building38. There is a vast amount of building work to be done, but shortages ofcertain materials timber, structural steel, and clay products, in that order ofimportance will be a limiting factor on the size of the building programme which can be carried out in 1947.39. Already, owing to material shortages, under-employment is showingitself in the building industry, and if there is a further rapid increase in thebuilding labour force this might develop on a substantial scale. Further, repeatedstoppages or delays owing to non-arrival of materials inevitably lowers the productivity of the industry. And it is of the utmost importance that the productivity of the building industry should be increased substantially aboveits present&apos;level.40. In our view it is of great importance that the Ministers concerned should actively encourage the building industry to make the utmost use of modern labour-saving appliances.41.   The rate of intake into the building industry is already showing signsI of slowing down.   We recommend that the target for the total building labour force should be fixed at 1,300,000 at the end of 1947 in lieu of the presentforecast of 1,370,000.42. The present arrangement is that about 60 per cent, of the total labour force is allocated to housing and 40 per cent, to non-housing purposes. On this basis a labour force of 1,300,000 at the end of 1947 should, be adequate to enable240,000 houses to be completed in 1947. This is the target proposed by theMinister of Health,
43. This target of 240,000 houses is considerably in excess of the number ofhduses which can be completed in 1947 with the supplies of timber at present insight. We see no reason, however, why this target should riot be approved, pro-vided it is agreed that, if further supplies of timber cannot be secured in sufficient quantities to enable 240^000 houses, to be completed in 1947, prompt steps will betaken to adjust the 1947 building programme and to switch labour to other formsof building work. There is, of course, an immense amount of new construction tobe done on building factories, &amp;c, which requires less timber than housing.44.   In this connection we attach great importance to the completion of thejnew factories under construction or scheduled for construction in the develop-ment areas.    The completion of these factories will not only help to increase!production of consumer goods for the home market and for export, but by tapping-resources of labour at present unemployed in the development areas, it can makea substantial contribution to the man-power problem.45. As and when there are indications of unemployment or under-employ-ment in the labour forces, we recommend that the Departments concerned should1be prepared at short notice either to raise the limit on the cost of maintenance and repair work which can be carried out without licence on all types of building,or to allow greater freedorii in the issue of licences for work not involving materials in short supply.  We understand that this is the present practice.46. We recommend that great care should be exercised by the HeadquartersBuilding Committee to keep the nuriiber of building projects started in propor-tion to the number of projects which can be completed within a reasonable period.oA griculture47. Agriculture is not a basic industry upon which other industries are dependent in the same sense as coal, power, steel or building materials. But fromthe point of view of our economy generally the &quot; standing labour force &quot; in agri-culture must be maintained at an adequate figure. At present this standinglabour force includes 80,000 prisoners of war who are being repatriated at therate of 6,000 a month, and it is possible that this rate may have to be increased.48. The proposals in paragraphs 14 to 19 as to the employment of foreignlabour and the employment of women will no doubt be of some help to agriculture.We also recommend, however, that, as in the case of coal (paragraph 30), special efforts should be made to increase the provision of houses in rural districts so asto attract new adult recruits to agriculture.Conclusion49. The total effect of our recommendations cannot be summarised in asingle man-power figure, since there are a number of items for which it is impos-sible to give a close estimate. In total the figures would probably add up to rather more than the man-power gap of 630,000 given in paragraph 8. But two thingsmust be remembered. First, that the requirements presented by Departments had themselves been pared down, on account of the known stringency of the positionand did not represent the real demand even in a period of scarcity. Secondly, wecannot ensure that the man-power released or withdrawn will in all cases be absorbed in the under-manned industries and thus secure that essential require-ments are met in full. We would emphasize that, in our view, the measureswhich we propose, taken together, represent a sufficient, but no more than asufficient, plan for bringing requirements into line with resources.50. This scrutiny of our requirements in order to bring them into line withour resources is the keynote of our Report. The position will need to be constantlywatched, and quick decisions taken, in order that our plans may be adjusted tothe available resources in the constantly changing situation.51 In the field of consumption, there will inevitably be a continuing lackof balance between supply and demand for consumption goods and services.The most we oan do is to see that the consumer does not suffer more than can be helped.52. In the field of both private and public investment our aim must bethe utmost selectivity. The main criterion must be whether investment projectswill yield an early dividend in terms of output and competitive efficiency.
53. If the Cabinet approve this Report, we ask that the Ministers concerned should be invited to take the necessary action without delay, and to report withina month to the Lord President.54. We would also propose that a draft White Paper based on this report should be presented to Parliament, with a view to a debate on economic affairs inthe second half of February.55 We suggest that this White Paper should be on the following broadlines : (a) A description of our machinery for economic planning.(&amp;) An account of the development of our economic affairs in 1946, givingthe latest statistics.(c) An analysis of the economic position as it stands to-day, setting outfrankly and fearlessly our present difficulties.(d) A statement of the remedies for these difficulties which the Governmenthave decided to adopt.56. The preparation of the Economic Survey for 1947 has involved a greatdeal of work, carried out at high pressure, by the Steering Committee, theEconomic Survey Working Party and those associated with them. I think mycolleagues would wish to express their appreciation of the work that has beendone by all concerned.(Intld.)       H.
