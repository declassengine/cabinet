&apos;      83 /(THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (hi) 186TH JANUARY,   XSkl- CABIKE TGOAL AND ELECTRICITYMemorandum by the President of the Board ofTrade1, I have seen the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;smemorandum (C.F.(h7) 6) on coal and electricity.2. The position as I understand it is that there willbe a shortfall of coal during the next couple of months atthe rate of 300,000 tons a week.      The requirements in solidfuel for industrial production are about 950,000 tons of which200,000 tons is for iron and steel.      In addition industryuses electricity and gas to the equivalent of somewhere in theneighbourhood of half a million tons.      This gives a totalrequirement of roughly a million and a half tons,  out of whichthe shortfall of 300,000 tons has to be met.3. With a shortfall of this magnitude,   it seems to mequite impracticable to continue with the existing  scheme, andthe present priority arrangements are inappropriate to thecircumstances now revealed.COPY NO.h- I suggest as the only way of meeting the situationeffectively and promptly that the allocations of solid fuelto all industrial firms outside iron and steel and coke ovensbe cut by kO per cent,  or if the Minister of Fuel and Powerconsiders necessary 50 per cent.,  iron and steel and coke ovens being cut by,  say,  20 per centi      Similarly, directionsshould be served on firms that their consumption of gas and electricity per month must be reduced by L\0 per cent, fromthat of the month of November instead of the present 2-g- percent.      By means of these cuts a pool of coal will be createdwhich should be allocated between the different Regions andthe Regional Fuel Allocation Committees should be instructedto apply this pool to meet special needs.5. Since I understand therepresentatives have to make theinext period on the 11th January,into force at once.      To begin wiAllocation Committees must be lefwithout other guidance than thattreatment to any industry automathowever,  it will be necessary toto the priorities which they aredistributing the pool,  subject ofof individual undertakings.      I S ministry of Fuel&apos;s Regionalr plan of deliveries for thethe system must be broughtth the Regional Fuelt to administer the poolthey are not to give specialically.      As soon as possible,give them further guidance asto use as a guide in course to the circumstancesuggest that the Lord President
of the Council might be asked if he would undertake to draw up in consultation with the Departments concerned a new listof the industries or firms which are to have special treatment.In drawing up this list I suggest that it will be important to have regard &quot;both to the importance of the production ofdifferent industries from the supply point of view and also tothe importance of not creating wholesale unemployment in industries which use a small quantity of fuel per personemployed.6. A meeting of the Chairmen of the Regional Boards for industry in iheir capacity as Chairmen of the Regional FuelAllocation Committees had already been called for Wednesdaymorning,  the 8th,, before I saw the Minister of Fuel&apos; s paper.I should like the authority of the Cabinet to indicate to them the facts of the situation and the functions which theirCommittees will be called upon to fulfil.R .
