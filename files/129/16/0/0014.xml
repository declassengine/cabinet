THISSOPKBTY OF HIS BRITAMHIC  MAJBSTY&apos;8 GfOYERNMEHTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1947SECRETCP. (47) 14i-th January, 1947Copy^No.. 9 GCABINETPROPOSEDINTERGOVERNMENTAL   MARITIMEORGANISATIONCONSULTATIVEMemorandum by Minister of state . In Memorandum CP. (46) 433 dated 26th November, 1946, the Ministerof Transport reported to the Cabinet on recommendations put forward by thelate United Maritime Consultative Council for the establishment of an Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.2. On 28th November the Cabinet discussed this paper (see cabinet conclusions 101 / 46 of 28th November) and agreed in principle that the Recom-mendations should be accepted. They requested, however, the Steering Committeeon International Organisations to consider certain points raised in the cabinet discussion and submit a further report.3. The Steering Committee has accordingly prepared a report which I now submit to my colleagues. The terms of the report have been approved by theMinister of Transport.H. McN.1. The Steering Committee on International Organisations submit thefollowing report on points raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion : (A) Is it necessary that a separate A gency should be established for inter-nationalconsultation on shipping matters? Could it mot form ppjrt of the Economicand Social Council?2. In providing for international consultation on shipping matters our essential requirements are :  ;&apos;,(i) Effective provision must be made for collaboration in technical matters affecting shipping. There is much work to be done in bringing upto date the many conventions existing in this field where it isimportant that the world should not lag behind our high standards,e.g., in the field of maritime safety.(ii) International discussion of shipping questions should proceed in a forumwhere we can take our proper position as the leading maritime nation and where full weight is given to the views of other maritimecountries.3. These requirements can best be achieved through the establishment ofa Specialized Agency. The technical matters could not be dealt with by theEconomic and Social Council in the ordinary course of its business, nor by theTransport and Communications Commission which has been set up to cover all forms of transport. The machinery must provide for consultation between allinterested parties at expert level with expeditious means of giving effect, bygovernmental action, to recommendations. Any procedure handling such questions through the Economic and Social Council, or the Transport and communications Commission, would be cumbersome. Decisions reached wouldnave to pass through several stages of United Nations procedure before issuing13794   [32964]
as recommendations to Governments.   On the other hand, the procedure proposalfor the Specialized Agency is simple.  While it would be primarily a consultatiand advisory body, recommendations passed by it would be made directGovernments or to other intergovernmental bodies for action.4. Experience has shown how important it is that all countries primarilJconcerned should share in the framing of the Constitution of any new body arj&apos;in the drawing up of recommendations for new conventions or amendments to existing conventions. If this were left to the Transport Commission, it wouldbe necessary to create a sub-Commission on which some maritime countries wouldprobably not be represented at all, and non-maritime countries would be over-represented. Through the establishment of a Specialized Agency as proposedwe can best hope to make effective for peacetime purposes the strong tradition of co-operation between the shipping nations built up during the war.5. There is a strong body of opinion in favour of a Specialised Agency for shipping. The Temporary Transport and Communications Commission itselfrecommended that a special world-wide agency should be established to deal withshipping matters. The present proposal has emerged from the United maritime consultative Council, which is representative of 18 Governments, including allthe important maritime Governments, and it is designed to bring on to a regular and permanent basis in relation to the United Nations the provisional arrange-rnents for consultation between the Governments of maritime nations which ithas been found necessary to develop.6. The constitution of the proposed Agency will be such as to give fullscope to the United Kingdom as the leading maritime nation in a body where wecan expect the support of other maritime nations. It would be contrary to our interests to have international shipping questions handled in any body which wasnot so carefully constituted for the purpose, and in which discussion might be prejudiced by manoeuvres connected with quite other matters.7. For the above reasons we are satisfied that it is better that internationalconsultations on shipping matters should be effected through a Specialised Agencyrather than through a body subordinate to the Economic and Social Council.8. The proposed body will need only a small secretariat. Those who have prepared the proposals have been insistent that its success depends upon directcollaboration between those in various nations who are handling shippingquestions, without the intervention of an elaborate international secretariat.(B) We must be careful to avoid international obligations which would imfedtthe recovery and growth of our mercantile marine. In particular wtshould avoid international regulation of seamen&apos;&apos;s wages to bring outrates up to the United States level9. Our interests as a maritime Power able to give efficient service on com-petitive terms lies in establishing the principle that ships may trade freelythroughout the world. In the past, the intervention of some Governments,by discriminatory or restrictive action in favour of their own flag, has restrictedour scope. It will be a great step forward if, through the adoption of theproposals of the United Maritime Consultative Council, we can secure general acceptance of our principle and establish an international forum in which nationsoffending against it will be compelled to defend their action. It is a noteworthyachievement that nations like the United States and France, which have indulgedin discriminatory practices to our detriment in the past, have been brought to subscribe to these proposals.10. In technical matters, where we have our own high standards, it willbe of great value to have an international body charged with the duty of securinggeneral compliance.11. International discussion of seamen&apos;s wages and conditions is already provided for through the International Labour Organisation; as to this, setbelow.(C) Co-ordination of the activities of the proposed Organisation with the Intel-national Labour Organisation and other Specialised Agencies12.   Matters affecting wages and conditions of labour of seamen are withithe competence of the I.L.O.  It is generally recognised that the new Agency musnot encroach on the functions of the I.L.O.   In the original draft of its constittion a clause was included to cover this point.   It was omitted on the advic
sof the United States draftsmen that it should be dealt with in the agreementdefining the relations of the new Agency with the United Nations.13. It will be necessary to define the relations of the new Agency with severalspecialised Agencies besides the I.L.O. and we consider it important that provisionfor this should be made in the constitution to avoid any misunderstanding whichmight otherwise arise from the wide definition of scope and purposes in Article Iof the Constitution. We suggest therefore that the United Kingdom should propose the insertion of a general provision to ensure that the new agency shouldnot concern itself with matters within the competence of other Specialised Agenciesexcept by agreement with them. It is not too late to suggest an amendment ofthis kind on which there is not likely to be any difficulty with other Governments.(D) It would be undesirable that the site of the Shipping Organisation shouldbe in the United States14. The majority of the Governments represented on the United maritime consultative Council are believed to share this view, but the matter was left for later discussion. Ministers are to consider further the general question of the siting of the headquarters of Specialised Agencies.
