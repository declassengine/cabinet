THIS&apos; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC JAaJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. 1cabinetPALESTIKIS:__FUTURE policy memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies at the meeting of the Cabinet; on 15th January, theForeign Secretary advanced the proposal that we should adopt,as the basis of our future policy in Palestine, the plan for provincial Autonomy amended in such a way that it pointstowards an independent unitary State and. incorporates asmuch as possible of the Arab plan.      As the minister responsible for the administration of Palestine, I must submit that,  after much inquiry and discussion,  I cannot see any hope of a settlement on these lines.      I realise, of course,that manor issues of an international and strategic characterare involved in the adoption of any solution of the palestine problem and in this memorandum I am dealing mainly with theposition as I sec it from the point of view of theadministration of that country, though I am. not unmindful ofthese wider issues.    For this purpose I think that  it may beof use to my colleagues if I first refer to the three plansnow before H.M.G.   (the Foreign secretary proposal is a combination of two of these plans) and state my viewsregarding them.2. The three plans are:    our own plan for a system of provincial Autonomy:    the Arab plan for a unitary PalestinianState under Arab majority rule:    and partition.Provineial Autonomy3. My colleagues are familiar with the main features of the Provincial Autonomy scheme.      This plan was putforward by my predecessor, was adopted by the Anglo-Americanexperts, and was announced in parliament by the Lord Presidentas the basis for consultation with the Arabs and the Jews.It was,  however,  always realised that the primary requirement of the Provincial Autonomy plan was the willingness of thetwo communities to operate it and unfortunately bothcommunities have already voiced their  refusal to do so.&quot;Without such willingness the plain is a paper plan only.    its success depends on the co-operation of the two communities andsuch co-operation cannot, in existing circumstances, be achievednor is it likely to be achieved for a long time to come.So long as the plan loaves the ultimate policy to be pursued in Palestine for future determination it will continue to be rejected by both parties;    if that policy is declared inadvance it will be rejected even more vehemently by one ofthem.      The Arabs would take no part in provincial AutonomySB C RET C.P.(47) 321 6 thJ an u ary,j &quot;I 3k 7
to be followed by partition, the Jews would take none inProvincial Autonomy to be followed by a unitary State.      Ithas become clear that the Jews will accept no solution whichdenies their claim to Statehood;    moreover,  the HighCommissioner has pointed out &apos;the grave administrative difficulties inherent in the operation of the plan havingregard to the present situation In Palestine.      In view ofthe further fact that the Government of the United states has refused categorically to endorse  it,  I do not considerthat it can any longer be regarded as a practical proposition.The Arab Plan4. The Arab plan visualises Palestine as a State underArab majority rule,  in the government of which the Jews wouldbe represented in accordance with their numbers,  i.e. one Jewto two Arabs.      It is designed to give  the Arabs full controlboth over the framing of the constitution and over any government which may be constituted under it.      It ispractically a repetition of the plan embodied in the white paper of 1939 but with adaitional restrictions on Jewishright s.bA It has been argued,  and not without force,   that theArab plan is founded on normal democratic principles sincethe will of the majority will prevail.      It is a.lso claimed that it  is in conformity with the provisions of Article 76of the Charter of the United Hat ions in that  it spellsprogressive development towards self-government in accordancewith the &quot;freely expressed wishes of the people concerned&quot;,using the &quot;words as referring to the wishes of two-thirds of the population of Palestine.6. On the other hand, while the plan can be defendedin theory,  there is not the slightest hope of its provingworkable in practice.      The Jews would not even be in a minority in Palestine in the sense in which a political partymay be  in a minority under an ordinary democratic system,with prospects of coming one day into power themselves andthus being in a position to implement &quot;their own policies.Future Jewish immigration, if any, being designated under theplan as a matter to be determined by the Arabs alone,  the jews would be condemned to the status of a permanent minoritywith no such possibility in view.7. Not only does the plan incorporate every feature ofthe White paper of 1939 to which the Jews then took exception,but it introduces new conditions equally repugnant to Jewishsentiment.      These include the provisions that no immigrantarriving in Palestine shall have a note until he has residedin the country for ten years and that the Jewish educational system shall be&apos; subjected to majority Arab control.      It can be stated unhesitatingly that not even the most moderate Jew wouldbe prepared to acquiesce for a moment  in the state of affairsvisualised in the plan.      It would spell the cessation of immigration,  the arrest of Jewish    development in Palestine,and the permanent subjugation of the National Home,  with itshighly organised European population and its extensive commercial and industrial interests,  to a backward Arab electorate,largely illiterate and avowedly inimical to its further progress.8. . While it might be possible to persuade the Arab states to agree to certain modifications of their plan,  there is no
20 Qprospect of their consenting to waive any of its threecardinal conditions, majority control of the Government ofPalestine, Arab control of Jewish immigration, and the earlywithdrawal of mandatory supervision.      These features willbe resisted by the Jews with every resource which they possess.Were effect given to the Arab proposal that the plan shouldbe enforced regardless of Jewish opposition,  the inevitable result would be an organised revolt on the part of the latter,coupled with a refusal to recognise or to pay taxes (of whichthey contribute at least two-thirds) to the Government thusconstituted.      The position in Palestine would thereby be rendered far worse even than it is today since the administra-tion and the Armed Forces would have to deal not only withterrorism but with tho- organised opposition of the wholeJewish population. &apos;    Implementation of the further Arab proposal that, having put the plan into operation, H.M. Government should withdraw and declare Palestine independent whether the Jewsco-operate or not, would mean abandoning the country to civil war, .a war which would have wide repercussions as it wouldprobably lead to a wave of persecution, directed againstJewish communities elsewhere throughout the Middle East.9. In my opinion,, the cost of enforcing this plan wouldbe disorder and bloodshed on a scale which we could nevercontemplate.      It would raise an issue of first-class importance with the United States where the Executive andLegislature would probably  vie with one another indenunciation.      There would also be adverse reactions inthe Empire itself..     It v/ould moreover,  in my view,  beimpossible for His Majesty&apos;s Ministers to defend the resultingposition either in Parliament or in the country.      It wouldmean a gross betrayed of the Jews if,  after undertakingresponsibility for the original establishment and subsequentsafeguarding of the Jewish National Home, we were to hand the mover   to   the mercy of the Arabs as subjects of a State,  ofWhich,  in all probability,  the Mufti would be the Head, with no power of interference from outside.      The policy would be indiametrical conflict with the undertakings given by the LabourParty, prior to its assumption of power,  regarding thedevelopment of the National Home.The plan proposed by the Foreign Secretary10. The plan proposed by the Foreign Secretary is a combination of the two plans which I have described and,  in myopinion, has most of the disadvantages of both.      He suggests an initial period of Provincial Autonomy.      I have already givenreasons why,  after consultation with my advisers and with theHigh Commissioner,  I do not believe this to be possible.I am circulating to my colleagues a. note by the High Commissionersetting-out the objections from the point of view of thePalestine Administration.      Jewish refusal to operate the plan would be even more vehement were it modified as suggested so asto point to a unitary State and so as to incorporate any of themain features of the Arab proposals.      Nor do I believe that a unitary State in Palestine is a practicable proposition.      Thegulf between the two communities has become too deep.     &apos;Such aState must mean the subordination of the Jews to the Arabs,  andthe complete frustration of Jewish national aspirations;    anyattempt at such subordination would,  I am convinced,  bring abouta situation in Palestine in which the Jews would have to be heldin subjection by force and by force alone.Parti ti on11* In my opinion,  the only reasonable solution of thePalestine problem is that recommended by the Royal Commissionof I936, namely the partition of the country between the Arabs
9 ** and the Jews.      This solution possesses an element of finalitywhich is elsewhere absent.      It would give to each communitya maximum degree of power to manage its own affairs and aminimum degree of power to interfere in the affairs of theother.12. Certain of -the objections to Partition are freshin the minds of my colleagues&apos; from the last discussion andI need not repeat them here.       I would merely say that I doubt whether this policy would evoke such serious repercussionsas are sometimes foreshadowed.       In Palestine,  because ofthe recent deterioration of -Arab feeling,  its implementationwould undoubtedly cause some violence and disorder on thepart of the Arabs, but this may not be on so large a scaleas has sometimes&apos; been represented.      If a decision is not too long delayed,  it might even be confined to local riotingin the main towns.13. I would be the last person to under-estimate thedifficulties of Partition and more particularly of finding a plan of Partition which, while not demonstrably unfair tothe Arabs,  could be regarded as  in any way satisfyingZionist aspirations.      It cannot be denied that the schemeof Partition prepared by the Cabinet Committee of&quot; 1944Involves certain serious  injustices to  the Arabs.       I have since had a revised scheme prepared which obviates,   to someextent at least, certain of these injustices, but whether itdoes so to the extent necessary to make the plan acceptable to the United Nations I am unable to say.      But I believethat our object should be to prepare a scheme of partitionwhich does the maximum possible justice to both communities and then to stand upon this scheme as our future policy.13. I realise further that under partition we may not get all the strategic advantages -which the Chiefs of Staffrequire.&apos;     It is not impossible that we may be refusedfacilities in the Arab area,  should it not be linked withTrans-Jordan,  or  that the United Nations may consider  thatJerusalem and the surrounding territory should be placed under a joint trusteeship in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould obtain no particular advantages.      But these arepossibilities which,   in my opinion,  have to be faced andregarded as the price of escape from our existing embarrassments.14. In short,  I can see in Partition a hope of thesolution of the Palestine difficulties.,&apos;    I can see none inany other plan.      It is the solution most, in harmony withthe trend of public opinion and of the Press  in this countryand is that most likely to win United States support and the endorsement of the labour Party.      Otherwise,  I&apos;regret thatI can see little hope of order or of sound administration.Conelusion15. It seems quite certain that we can put no new policy into effect in Palestine without reference to theUnited Nations.      Such a reference is necessary in strictlaw if either  the Arab plan or Partition is to be adopted?in the case of provincial autonomy a reference might beobviated for a short time, but we should almost immediately be challenged, to produce a trusteeship agreement in respectof the territory.      It is, moreover, probable that even before this  challenge one of the Arab States&apos;would appeal to theSecurity Council.      It seems to me therefore that  the problembefore us is not what policy we shall immediately implement inPalestine, hut what policy we shall recommend to the united nations for implementation.
16. In my opinion, we should now decide to make a last attempt to produce a plan of Partition which does the least injustice to both communities and,  havingproduced such a plan, recommend it to the United Nations,indicating at the same time the difficulties  inherent inthe alternative schemes.      I myself feel in some doubthow the United Nations will vote on this issue, but evenon the assumption that it would be defeated, we should atleast have recommended what seems to us to be the best solution,  and the responsibility for rejecting it and forfinding an alternative solution would rest fairly andsquarely with the United Nations.      It will be necessaryto make it abundantly plain to them that,  if they rejectPartition,   the onus of producing an alternative solution is on them.      The present position in Palestine isintolerable and cannot be maintainedj    if the united nations fail to find an answer which we deem acceptableit will be necessary to consider whether we should notannounce our intention to withdraw from a situationwhich will have become    impossible.17. On the resumption of the Conference we should,I suggest to my colleagues,  attempt to explore with both parties all the various possibilities open,  explain thedifficulties which each presents and try to lead them inthe direction of a reasonable scheme of Partition as thebest and most equitable solution.A.
