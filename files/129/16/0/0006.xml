PIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTI  - Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1947j SECEET Copy&apos; Wo. 29CP. (47) 63rd January, 1947CABINET .COAL AND ELECTRICITYMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power. I wish to bring before my colleagues the situation which has developedabout coal supplies and electricity.2. Coal production has been steadily increasing since 1st October, running at a level of 170,000 tons a week over the corresponding period in 1945, andreaching a figure of 3,900,000 tons of deepmined coal in the &quot; bull week &quot; before christmas. But the consumption, especially of electricity, has continued to riseto such an extent that a critical situation has arisen a situation aggravated by difficulties in transport.3.   The facts about the consumption of electricity are as follows :- For last summer the Central Electricity Board originally estimated coalconsumption by Power Stations at 5 per cent, more than in the previous summer.The actual increase was 13 per cent.For this winter the Central Electricity Board&apos;s original estimate was-6 per cent, above last winter. Up to Christmas the actual increase was17 per cent.* In the week ending the 20th December 687,000 tons of coal were used byPower Stations or 25 per cent, above the amount used in the corresponding week of 1945, and in the week ending 27th December (Christmas week, when manyindustrial undertakings were closed for 2 or 3 days) it was 33 per cent, aboveChristmas week 1945.On 1st November, 1946, coal stocks at Power Stations were only 3-7 weekscompared with 6 weeks at 1st November, 1945. This low level of stocks arosepartly from the rise in the general level of industrial requirements for coal andpartly from the increase in consumption of electricity referred to above. steps were taken to increase deliveries so as to secure 4 weeks&apos; stocks by Christmas.It was calculated that this, together with the order to limit industrial consump-tion of electricity from 1st January to the November figure would safeguard the position. Owing, however, to the continuous rise in consumption, stocks byChristmas were only 2 - 9 weeks instead of the minimum safety level of 4 weeks.They are still falling and are unlikely to be more than 2-2 weeks on 3rd January.4. I have increased the programme of deliveries by a further 20,000 tonsa week. Even so, on present trends of consumption, stocks at the end of thismonth are not likely to be more than 1^ weeks. They may be less and they will fall still lower thereafter. These are average figures and any fall below anaverage of two weeks will mean that one or more Power Stations will go outof production. Owing to the shortage of Generating Plant, other Power Stationscould not assist and a complete failure of electricity supply over wide areas would be inevitable.5. This critical situation has been aggravated by transport difficulties.Since the beginning of October over 300,000 tons of opencast coal have had tobe put on the ground instead of being moved to consumers, and 320,000 tons of deep-mined coal have been lost through want of wagons at the pits. It is, more-over, estimated that at Christmas there were 750,000 tons more than the usualtonnage in &quot; the pipeline,&quot; i.e., in wagons in transit on the railways.[32956]
6. While I am hopeful that the recent trend towards increased production from the mines will continue, the next two months are ones in which output is affected by sickness among miners and we cannot expect production at thepre-Christmas level. The Departmental estimate is 3,600,000 tons a week. i hope also to get 120,000 tons a week of opencast coal, though this is dependenton the weather. It is doubtful whether the whole of this can be deliveredquickly to consumers under present transport arrangements. And even if itcan it would not be sufficient to meet requirements in view of the increase inthe consumption of electricity.&apos; 7. It is clear that we cannot allow Power Stations to go out of production:the consequences of a complete failure of electricity over wide areas are far too serious. It would mean complete paralysis throughout those areas loss of essential production, widespread unemployment, no lighting or means of cookingfor many households, and stoppage of electric trains and trams, &amp;c. It wouldbe impracticable to ration domestic consumption of electricity by 10^ millionusers at any rate at short notice. Propaganda and appeals for economy while they have had some effect have proved insufficient. Street lighting and shoplighting have already been reduced. Any further reduction of street lightingis opposed by the Police and Transport Authorities. In any case further reductionof lighting in streets, shops, &amp;c, would not materially relieve the position.8.   The alternatives therefore would appear to he either : (1) To increase deliveries to Power Stations at the expense of supplyingcoal to industry; or(2) To make an Order under the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Act, 1945, by which Power Stations would be empowered and directed to cut off the supply of electricity to specified works for a specified time or times.9. It is estimated that by increasing deliveries of coal to Power Stationsby a further 50,000 tons a week and securing the necessary priority for trans-porting it, stocks could be kept at slightly less than two weeks into February.This would mean trying to deliver to Power Stations in the next 6 weeks200,000 tons a week more than in the same period last year. Even so, the positionwould still be very precarious and to do this deliveries to industries other thanthe essential industries would have to be still further reduced. Even if no increase in supplies to Power Stations is made, deliveries to those industries will of course be seriously below their current consumption. If the extra deliveriesare made to Power Stations to the extent indicated above there are three possible ways of effecting the consequential further reductions to industry : (i) To spread the reductions over all industries other than the essential industries.(ii) To reduce deliveries to all industries other than the essential industries and certain scheduled high priority industries,(iii) To work out a new scheme of priorities between industries, under whichdeliveries to some selected industries would be reduced to a very small percentage of their consumption requirements or cut off altogether.It would take at least two weeks from the time a decision is takento make the necessary administrative arrangements to give effect toany such scheme; by this time, however, the situation would have got out of hand.10. If an Order were made under which Power Stations were empoweredand directed to cut off Power from industries or groups of industries for a speci-fied time or times, it would be necessary for the Regional Production Committees,under general instructions from the Board of Trade, to specify the order andthe extent to which individual undertakings were to be cut with the. object ofsecuring an immediate overall reduction of 25 per cent, in industrial consumptionof electricity or whatever figure is found to be necessary to maintain two weeks&apos;stocks at Power Stations. It has been suggested that the cutting off of power would give rise to claims for compensation, but it would seem reasonable thatit could and should properly be treated in the same way as raw materials ofindustry, and allocated in accordance with national needs when demand exceedssupply.
.11. A decision on which of these two alternatives is to be adopted mustbe taken at once if a break-down of Electricity supply before the end of themonth is to be avoided,12. It would also be desirable to relieve the position that will be created bywhichever alternative is adopted, by getting into consumption as quickly aspossible the coal that is at present on the ground and in wagons in transit on therailways. I suggest that an overrriding priority should be given to the movementof coal for the next month similar to that which I understand was given to themovement of military traffic before D-day and that a similar organisation to thatwhich was set up then should be re-established at Headquarters and in the Regionsto get the coal moved. If, as I understand, coal could be moved more quickly andin larger quantities if more locomotives were available, I suggest that all specialpassenger trains for sport and other non-essential purposes should be stopped forthe next month and it is for consideration whether long-distance passenger services should not be cut to provide heavy locomotives for coal traffic.13. Looking further ahead, apart from the problem of supplying coal tomeet the ever-increasing consumption, there is no possibility whatever of there being sufficient Generating Plant to meet that consumption. This winter there is a deficiency of 1 - 2 million kilowatts of Plant, due mainly to the delay in meetingthe orders placed by the Central Electricity Board immediately after the end ofhostilities. This has made it necessary to shed load day after day. Next winterthe deficiency of plant is estimated at 1 - 7 million kilowatts and in the winter of1948-49 at 1 - 8 million kilowatts. It takes several years to build and equip a largePower Station and even if new priorities are given now for building the newPower Stations and providing the necessary heavy electrical Plant, it will be 1950before we can hope to have enough Generating Plant to meet demand, and weshall not have enough then unless some check is placed on consumption. It willbe necessary drastically to limit the supply and installation of machinery and domestic appliances which use electricity for power or heating or cooking in factories, houses, hotels, canteens, schools, &amp;c.; and to provide some check on consumption of existing appliances and machinery, both industrial and domestic.14. I feel it my duty to warn the Cabinet that for some considerable time there will not be sufficient fuel and power to meet the requirements put forward by Departments in view of the rising trend of consumption. In face of the inadequacy of raw materials including fuel and power we are attempting too much and if we are to avoid dislocation in every industry there must be someallocation of raw materials so as to ensure that the largest possible volume of essential industrial production is maintained. Beyond that it is impossible to go.It is, therefore, for the Cabinet to decide which industries or sections of industries are to be refused raw materials including fuel and power for purposes ofproduction.15.   To sum up,(1) I ask for a decision on whidh of the alternatives set out in paragraph 8is to be adopted to meet the immediate situation.(2) I ask for the priority in transport suggested in paragraph 12 for themovement of coal for a period of one month.(3) I ask for a decision to limit drastically the supply and installation ofmachinery and appliances using electricity for industrial and domestic purposes, and to limit consumption by existing users, and that themeans to effect this should be considered as a matter of urgency.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power,Millbank, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1947.
