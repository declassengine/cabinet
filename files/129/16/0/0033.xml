- \, 24;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1947SECRET Copy No.  ID.O. (47) 47th January, 1947CABINETDefence CommitteeDEFENCE ESTIMATES 1947-48Memorandum by the Minister of defence. The White Paper on the Central Organisation for Defence (Cmd. 6923)laid down a detailed plan for the consolidation of the Defence Estimates and theirpresentation in an integrated form to the Defence Committee and the Cabinet. Itsprocedure cannot be fully operative for next year&apos;s Estimates, on which, beforethe publication of the White Paper last October, preparatory work had already made considerable progress, on lines laid down by the Prime Minister. Inagreement with my colleagues I have endeavoured, however, to apply to the firstdrafts of those Estimates the processes of Ministerial scrutiny set out inparagraph 27 of the White Paper.2. I present the result of that scrutiny to the Defence Committee in thisMemorandum, which I have tried to confine to a statement of the salient features of the proposals for expenditure on behalf of the Services in 1947-48, with supporting details in the three Annexes and in the Report of the MinisterialProduction Committee which is being circulated separately.*3. I am assuming that a general explanation of the basis of Serviceexpenditure next year will be provided by me for Parliament as a White paper on Defence towards the end of February 1947; and that its publication will be closely followed by that of the detailed Estimates, which would be available by the time the general debate on defence is held early in March. The necessarydepartmental work on the final stages of preparing the several Estimates, and thetime required for their printing, make it essential for the final totals for each service to be fixed by about the middle of January. I therefore suggest thatthis Memorandum should be considered by the Defence Committee at a very early meeting.General4. The first draft of the 1947-48 Defence Estimates prepared by the three service Departments and the Ministry of Supply amounted in round figures toa total of  1,064 million, of which about  150 million represented terminalpayments, the figure for current expenditure being thus approximately 914 million. I discussed matters at this stage with the Service Ministers, and indicated to them that current Service expenditure of over  900 million was not,in my opinion, of the order which could possibly be accepted by the Government,having regard to the high proportion that it would represent of the total probablebudgetary provision. At my request they therefore proceeded to prune furthertheir draft Estimates in order to effect all possible reductions, short of thosewhich could result only from overall cuts leading to inability to meet essentialcommitments or to build up effective post-war Forces. The Ministerial Produc-tion Committee under my chairmanship has also examined the production, and[32957]* D.O. (47) 5.
2the research and. development programmes, put forward by the Joint war production Staff and the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee respectively. Theeffect of this severe pruning by the Service Departments themselves of their estimates, and of the scrutiny of the production, research and development programmes by the Ministerial Production Committee, is to leave us with an aggregate net total of current Defence expenditure, calculated in a manner described later in this memorandum, of the order of  795 million.5. It is abundantly clear that in the financial year 1947-48, service estimates are still on a transitional basis from war to peace conditions. Thatthis must be so can be seen by a study of commitments as listed in Annex I ofthe Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the strength of the Armed Forces (D.O. (46)135). In that connection, it should be noted that the Chiefs of Staff assumed that the Peace Treaties with Austria and Italy would be signed and ratified in1947 and that our commitments in Austria, Italy, Venezia Giulia and greece would then be liquidated; equally, they assumed evacuation of our Forces from egypt, except for the Canal Zone. During this period the release scheme, onits ordered age and service basis, will still be in full swing, and in fact the next two years will see perhaps the steepest comparative fall in trained man-powerand the final dispersal of the backbone of war entrants : this of itself will impose a great organisational strain upon the Services, and particularly upon the army which has the brunt of the task of meeting the current international commitments of this country. I should be misleading my colleagues if I did not point outthat the financial provision for the Services in 1948-49 will also be governedto some extent by the financial effects of the release scheme, with its terminalcharges, and at the present juncture it would be unsafe to predict that the Worldwill have reached a state of order and peacefulness in 1948 in which the incubusof Service liabilities which are a direct legacy of the long years of war will have dissapeared : provision for an occupation force in Germany will in any case stillbe necessary.6. With these considerations in mind and it is of the essence of thematter that the Defence Committee and the Cabinet should take the long-termview of Service planning and expenditure over the next few years I have dis-cussed with the Service Ministers, the Minister of Supply, and the Chiefs ofStaff the Defence Estimates for the coming year, especially in relation to the shape of the eventual organisation and equipment of the Services, aptly expressedin paragraph 27 of the Defence White Paper as the problem of giving thecountry forces and equipment in properly balanced proportions. I have satisfiedmyself that the proposals, as now revised, which I invite the Defence Committeeto endorse for presentation to the Cabinet are correctly based in relation to the short-term problem of meeting probable Service commitments in the coming year,and, witJhin our present limited knowledge, should permit of the evolution of thepost-war Armed Forces along lines which developments in the organisational and research fields may later prescribe.7. I must emphasise, however, the need for the Government to consider,and settle, our long-term defence policy, together with the shape and size .)fthe Armed Forces under that policy. This course is not only desirable in itself,but is essential even for the transitional period of the next year or two if theServices are to be able to handle their affairs with efficiency during that period.Each of the Services is faced with a substantial run-down, more especially intrained men, and will be involved in reorganisation of a fundamental character.They must know where they are going and how they are to get there. Ideally,Pne would have liked to see the necessary long-term decisions taken before, orin parallel with, the settlement of 1947 Estimates. For reasons of time alone,that is quite impossible. The Estimates for 1947, as affected by the substantial reductions which, we have been able to achieve in the original proposals must,therefore, be considered on an ad hoc basis without commitment on long-term policy. None the less, I am sure that the Government must, at the earliest practicable moment, provide the Services with a peace-time directive to whichthey can work. To that end, I have already initiated discussions with the Chiefsof Staff and in due course I shall be reporting on this issue to the DefenceCommittee.8. I turn now to the actual problems presented by the Defence estimates for 1947-48. They may be considered first and foremost under the three mamheads of man-power, production with research and development, and finance.
Man-Power.9. At the request of the Prime Minister, the Chiefs of Staff prepared their estimate (D.O. (46) 135) of the size of the Forces they consider necessary on31st December, 1946, and on 31st March, 1948. Their Memorandum was con-sidered by the Defence Committee on 20th November and I have had subsequent discussions with my colleagues and with the Chiefs of Staff, whose proposals have been examined against the background of their effects upon the generaleconomy of the country. Details of the man-power requirements of each service at the end of the financial year, i.e., 31st March, 1948, are set out in Annex Cto this Memorandum. As will be seen, the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff wouldrespdt in the following strengths of the three Services at that date : Royal Navy.........       ...      ...      164,000Army ...............      612,000Royal Air Force    ............      250,000a total of 1,026,000, plus men under training, who might amount to another150,000.  With the addition of men under training the figures would become : RovalNavy...       ......      ...      ...      189,000Army ...............      672,000Royal Air Force......       ......      315,0001,176,000The effect on the release scheme of providing the number of men and womenwhich the Chiefs of Staff ask should be accepted as a practical basis for planning for 31st March, 1948, can best be judged by a comparison between the require-ment now put forward and the estimated strength of the Forces at 31st March,1948, resulting from the arrangements for call-up published in the White Paper&quot; Call-up to the Forces in 1947 and 1948&quot; (Cmd. 6831) and from a reasonablyoptimistic estimate of the intake from voluntary recruitment. This comparison is shown in the following table : -Number of men and women in theForces at 31st March, 1948.Numbers proposed bythe Chiefs of Staff as Estimateda practical basis numbers infor planning. the Forces.Navy      .........       189,000 189,000Army      .........       672,000 590,000RA.F..........      315,000 315,000Total .......    1,176,000 1,094,00010. It will be seen that while, under current Government policy on call-up and release, the Navy and the Air Force should be able to obtain the numbers in the Chiefs of Staff estimate for 31st March, 1948, the Army will be short of the required numbers by some 82,000. The requirement in the case of theNavy and of the Air Force is, stated in its simplest terms, to maintain a minimumoperational Force while at the same time affording the basis on which to begin the construction of the eventual post-war Services for their peace-time role. the target sizes of these Forces will probably not greatly exceed the numbers required on 31st March, 1948, by the Navy and the Air Force. In the Army case, however,the requirement at that date is dictated by the probable commitments of that service in March 1948; and is considerably in excess of the eventual target size of the Army for normal peace-time.11. I consider that the gap of 82,000 (falling wholly on the Army) mustbe accepted, and that the figures produced by the Chiefs of Staff must be reducedby that amount, since to bridge the gap would involve a further retardation ofthe planned rate of release- a course which is in my view quite unthinkable.12.   Subject to this reduction of 82,000 in the size of the Army at 31st March,1948, my conclusion is that we must accept the man-power implications of theChiefs of Staff proposals including the maintenance of the planned rate of release.   But I am bound to point out in this connexion that the Defence and[32957] B 2
Services Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party are pressing hard for an acceleration in coming months of the release scheme, which I do not think iscompatible with the ability of the Services to meet their commitments, or withan ordered progress towards their aim of producing well-balanced Defence Forcesin four or five years&apos; time.Production and Research and Development13. ,In accordance with the directions of the Prime Minister, the require-ments under these two heads have been collated by the Joint War production staff for production and by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff for research and develop-ment. The reports of these bodies have been scrutinised by the MinisterialProduction Committee meeting under my chairmanship. The report of thisCommittee has been circulated separately.*Production14. &quot;The. provision proposed on account of production in the financialyear 1947-48, after an allowance of 8 per cent, for shortfall on what we regard as the minimum requirement of the Services, amounts to  m. 180 -41&quot;, divided between the Services as follows :  m.Royal Navy    ...............      61-6Army    ...&quot;      ...      ............      60-8Royal Air Force      ...      ...      ...      ...      58-0The requirements have been assessed in the light of the following principles : (1) Maximum use of existing stocks, with the object of reducing commit-ments on new production to the minimum.(2) Limitation of requirements from new production to such items as canbe fully justified : *(i) as absolutely essential for minimum current needs,(ii) as compatible with foreseeable changes in design of equipment.(3) Maintenance of manufacturing capacity and techniques which form anessential part of the country&apos;s war potential.15. The programmes provide in the main for the essential maintenance ofthe forces, with some modest measure of re-equipment of E.A.F. Fighter Com-mand and the Naval Air Arm and of the anti-aircraft defences of the UnitedKingdom. Details of the programmes which I recommend for the approval ofthe Defence Committee appear in the Report of the Ministerial production committee.Research and Development16. The total amount (including works) required under this head on tineVotes of the Admiralty and of the Ministry of Supply is  m. 66-1, divided asfollows :  m.Admiralty ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        8-5Ministry of Supply       ...       ...       ......       ...      57-6These figures reflect to a large degree the situation left at the end of the war,though some measure of reorientation is already under way, particularly in thedirection of increasing efforts in new fields, such as guided projectiles, atomic energy, and biological warfare. This reorientation is limited by shortages ofsuitable scientific man-power and by the time taken to build and equip newresearch establishments.17. The formulation of a long-term policy for scientific research anddevelopment may be expected to develop more rapidly now that the defence research Policy Committee has been set up. Sir Henry Tizard has taken upoffice as its chairman, and when the time comes to present proposals for theService Estimates for the financial year 1948-49 the ground should be much firmer18. Details of the research and development programme are included in theReport of the Ministerial Production Committee.* D.O. (47) 5.-j- This amount does not correspond with the cash provision in Service Estimates.
Financial Picture19. The first draft of the Defence Estimates amounted in round figures to atotal of  m. 1064, of which about  m. 150 represented terminal payments and m. 914 current expenditure. As indicated in paragraph 4 of this memorandum,very substantial reductions on those figures have been achieved. The estimates of the Service Departments, as now submitted for approval, are analysed under their main heads in Annex A; the Estimate of the Ministry of Supply is explained in Annex B. The result of what has been achieved by way of reduction canbe seen in the following tables : -I. Original FiguresNet current Terminalexpenditure charges Total m  m  mAdmiralty    ......        216-0 14-0 230 - 0War Oifiee......       410-6 46-4 457-air Ministry...       .:.        222-5 21-5 244-0Ministry of Supply ...         64-6 68-0 132 - 6Totals   ...      ...       913-7 149-9 1,063-6II.

On merits, thatmay well have been the correct procedure in the circumstances then prevailing.Since then, however, the Ministry&apos;s civilian activities have undergone considerable expansion and it would clearly be unjustifiable to regard the whole of the resultingexpenditure in 1947-48 as Defence expenditure. Annex B sets out the basis on which the Ministry of Supply&apos;s share of the expenditure dealt with in thismemorandum has been calculated. As regards the rest, I assume that theMinistry of Supply will make a direct approach to the Treasury like any other civil Department.20. The figures given in the above table do not include any provision inrespect of the cost of the Ministry of Defence. My present expectation is that my Departments Vote will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds, mainly by way of transfer of expenditure at present borne on other Votes, notably thatof the Cabinet Office.21. If matters were to be left on this basis, the total bill for Defence in1947 would be put at  m. 835 - 3 for current expenditure, with  m. 128 forinescapable terminal charges, amounting in all to  m. 963 - 3. I am sure, how-ever, that the matter cannot fairly be left on this basis. The figures quoted abovecontain large items which, even if they are borne on the Votes of the service departments and the Ministry of Supply, ought not to be regarded as a charge against our Defence expenditure. In the case of the Ministry of Supply thefigures inserted in the above table still contain an element not properlyattributable to Defence expenditure. Thus, of the total provision for research and development the Ministry of Supply estimate that  m. 11-5 could fairly be regarded as attributable to Civil Aviation (including  m. 0-5 for works and
 m. 2 for the Brabazon I project at Filton) and  m. 0-6 to radio research for civilian ends. Further, the whole of the expenditure on atomic energy and research and development, amounting to  m. 9 - 4, could appropriately be classified as civil expenditure, inasmuch as if atomic weapons were banned to-morrow theamount required for research and development in this field would remain unaltered. I suggest, therefore, that it would be reasonable to reduce the amountto be charged against the Defence budget on account of research and development by  m. 21 - 5, bringing the correct Defence provision on the Ministry of SupplyVote down to  m. 39-6.22. A point of similar kind arises on the War Office and Air MinistryVotes. Army Estimates include a net figure of  m. 15, and Air Estimates oneof  m. 3-75 In respect of the Polish Forces. The Polish Resettlement Corpsis not required for military duties and has been consigned to the care of thesetwo Service Departments for political and administrative reasons. Even afterallowance has been made for the fact that the Army and the R.A.F. will effectsome saving in- the employment of civilians by the use of Poles, and for the terminal element included in the figure of  m.18-75 quoted&apos; above, some  m.10of the amount included in Army Estimates, and some  nr. 2 - 5 in Air estimates in respect of the Poles can reasonably be regarded as not a Defence service.Again, Army Estimates carry a net charge of  m.l in respect of thecivil administration of occupied! ex-enemy territories in Africa. While itis true that these territories are still administered by the military authorities,that is largely an incidental result of the unavoidable delay in settling the futureof the Italian colonies, and the cost of the normal civil administration of these territories is not, in my view, properly to be regarded as a British Army Defencecommitment. Furthermore, the Army Estimate includes  m. 5 for Colonial forces stationed in their own territories. It appears to me to be quite clear that forces required for the internal security of the Colonies are a proper charge uponColonial exchequers, and that in cases where the Colony is unable to pay for themthey should be financed as necessary in accordance with pre-war practice by meansof grants-in-aid from the civilian Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote.Even if it is not regarded as practicable or desirable to make the accountingchange in 1947, it remains true that the Colonial Forces, in so far as they are stationed within their Colonies and are required for internal security, are not, and ought not to be regarded as, a part of the cost of the British Army. At a timewhen every single item of expenditure on Defence must be scrutinised with a viewto its reduction to the lowest possible level, I am sure that it is only fair that, in reaching a decision and in presenting the true picture to Parliament in theDefence White Paper, special attention should be drawn to the items on accountof the Poles, of the civil administration of occupied territories in Africa, and of colonial Forces.23. On the basis which I have outlined, the fair and proper charge againstDefence in respect of the Service Estimates and of the Ministry of SupplybecomesAdmiraltyWar Office   ......Air ministry ministry of Supply ...Grand Total24. These charges, heavy though they are, represent not only a markedreduction on the original proposals, but also a very substantial reduction on thefinancial provision required in the current financial year. In the White Paperpresented in February 1946 regarding the 1946-47 Defence Estimates it was stated that the total provision included in those Estimates would be  1,667million, of which  576 million was in respect of terminal charges, leaving a sumof  1,091 million as the amount required for current Service and Supply Estimateson the day-to-day running of the Services. Admittedly, these figures include thetotal provision for the Ministry of Supply amounting to  474 million, but it isestimated that not more than  25 million should be deducted from this figure inrespect of civilian expenditure.Net current	Terminal	Totalexpenditure	charges	 m.	 m.	 m.195-0	13-5	208-5358-5	450	403-5202-2	19-5	221-739-6	50-0	89-6795-3	128-0	923-3
As it turns out, the initial provision approved for the Service Departmentshas in some oases proved inadequate and supplementary estimates are now in contemplation. Comparison of the figures for the current financial year withthose outlined above for 1947-48, shows the large scale of the reductions whichare contemplated in Defence expenditure for a year still to be considered astransitional between war and peace and still largely under the shadow of continuing wartime commitments.Service Conditions25. Before I come to the conclusion of my memorandum, I feel that, inview of the degree of current interest in living conditions in the Services, I oughtto ensure that there is no misapprehension on the part of the Defence committee regarding the scale of improvement which will be practicable in 1947. TheService Ministers and I desire to see substantial improvements at the earliestpossible date. Moreover, my colleagues will know that the Defence and ServicesGroup of the Parliamentary Labour Party, in addition to the representations foraccelerating the release scheme which I have already mentioned, have put to thePrime Minister a comprehensive statement of reforms concerning welfare andconditions of service which they would wish to see implemented in the Services.The general answer which applies to the bulk of these latter proposals is thatthere are severe practical limitations of labour and resources, not to mentionmoney, which preclude any rapid approach to the agreed objective. It isregrettable that some of the very limited provision possible to this end has hadto be cut out from next year&apos;s Estimates.Conclusion26. Examination of the Estimate figures as now reduced indicates that further appreciable reductions could be effected only in one of two ways : (a) By reducing the size of the Services themselves, or(b) By cutting still further the production programme.A drastic cut in man-power in whatever manner it were distributed amongthe three Services could only mean inability to meet essential commitments, aswell as grave pre j udice to the prospect of building up small but efficient post-warForces in the next 5 years or so. The burden of current commitments bearsmost directly upon the Army, the strength of which in 1947 is likely to be considerably in excess of the size of the ultimate post-war Army. After a most careful examination of those commitments and of the manner in which it isproposed to meet them, I oan see no escape from the conclusion that the variousassumptions taken by the Chiefs of Staff already go as far as practicable in thedirection of minimising the obligations which will fall upon the Army. Currentcommitments bear less directly upon the strengths proposed for the Navy and theAir Force for 1947-48. Their problem is that of determining the minimumstrengths required for our initial defence in the event of war and as a. nucleusaround which to mobilise our full resources. Here, too, after consultation with my Service colleagues and with the Chiefs of Staff, I remain of opinion that i cannot advise reductions in the figures proposed for those Services. While thatis my conclusion on merits, I ought to emphasise to the Defence Committee that,from the financial point of view, even an extremely drastic reduction in Serviceman-power would mean comparatively small financial relief in 1947 because the saving in pay and keep would be offset to a substantial extent by terminalpayments in respect of release leave, demobilisation clothing, &amp;c.27. As regards any further reduction in the production programme for theServices in 1947-48, already reduced as it is from the original proposals submittedby the Joint War Production Staff, I consider that any further large-scale cutwould be impossible without- having the effect of making the Services largelynon-operational. It is no use having men in the Services unless they have thetools to use, and the production programme for the coming year does verylittle by way of safeguarding the war potential of industry, and practicallynothing towards the eventual rearmament of the Services which will be necessarywhen we have a clear idea of the effect on the Forces of current and prospectivedevelopments in the scientific and technical sphere.28. I fully realise that expenditure of the order which I am proposing forthe Services in the second financial year after the termination of hostilities, even after the substantial reductions which have been achieved, is appreciably in excessof what might generally have been anticipated by Parliament and by public
opinion, and may be very unwelcome to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whohas not only to consider the net total of current expenditure, but also to make provision in his budget for the charges of a terminal nature amounting to some m. 128, which are excluded from the net figure of  m. 795 since they are alegacy from the war years.29. The assimilation of the lessons of the recent war, and the progress infundamental defence research, will, it is to be hoped, show the way to economy in men, money and materials in future years. For the interim period I see no practicable alternative to the proposals put forward in this paper.Recommendations30.   I recommend that the Defence Committee should approve: (i) Finance. Provision in the Estimates of the Service Departments and.   of the Ministry of Supply amounting to  m. 835 - 3 for net current&apos; expenditure, together with  m. 128 - 0 for terminal charges, on theunderstanding that the true charge for Defence in 1947-48 will beof the order of  m. 795 for net current expenditure, plus  m. 128for terminal charges.(ii) Man-power.

ANNEX CExtract from a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the Strength of the armed Forces at 31st December, 1946, and 31st March, 1948.(D.O. (46) 135-8th November, 1946)* * * * * -:Part II-31st March, 1948Role of the Armed Forces12. Our estimates of the forces required at 31st March, 1948, are based onthe necessity to provide : 1(a) Forces for our initial defence in the event of war and a nucleus aroundwhich to mobilise our full resources.(&amp;) Forces to meet our security and occupational commitments overseas.The size of the Army at this date is governed by the extent of our overseas commitments, rather than by the need for maintaining a nucleus for expansion forwar. The size and composition of the Navy and the Air Force is governed moreby the necessity to provide forces for our initial defence and to maintain a nucleus from which to expand in emergency.13. A forecast for March 1948 must at this stage still to some extent betentative. The forces needed for security and occupational commitments will depend on political developments. The size and nature of those required forinitial defence and as a nucleus may change both with the political situation,and in the light of developments in weapons and methods of war and their effecton the strategic situation of the Commonwealth.The forces which we now consider necessary have, however, been based onthe best available assessment of these factors and on fundamental strategic con-siderations which are unlikely to be changed materially.Requirements for Initial Defence and Expansion in War14. The first task of the Armed Forces in war will be the defence of theUnited Kingdom, the main support areas and the communications between them.In addition to purely defensive forces this will call for the provision of certainoffensive forces which will act as a deterrent to war breaking out and will limit the striking power of the enemy should it do so.At the outset these tasks will have to be undertaken by those forces inexistence in peace-time together with those which can be mobilised immediately.Since we cannot rely on a long warning period, we must maintain the minimumforces which we consider necessary to fulfil these vital roles.In addition all three services must be capable of expanding to a balancedforce employing the total man-power available to the armed forces in war.15. All three Services, and particularly the R.A.F., must therefore main-tain in the United Kingdom forces which, with the addition of those immediately available on mobilisation, will be sufficient to ensure the minimum security of thecountry, and the communications to it. There must also be skeleton organisationsupon which the war-time expansion of the fighting services will be based.&apos;In view of their overseas commitments, however, the Army forces included under this heading are limited to a nucleus A.A. organisation and the TerritorialArmy which will be beginning to take shape.16. In addition nucleus defences for certain bases in other parts of theworld must be maintained in peace-time in order that in the initial stages ofa war we shall be able to defend the vital Commonwealth communications.Security and Occupational Commitments Overseas17. The tasks which our forces are called upon to fulfil under this headingmay be summarised as follows : (a) To maintain law and order in territories for which we are responsible.(6) To play our part in the occupation of those ex-enemy countries whichwill still be occupied in 1948.[32957] d
(c) To maintain British prestige, to provide an adequate backing to ourdiplomacy and where necessary to ensure that in areas still underdispute we shall not be faced with a fait accompli.(d) To protect British lives and property in the event of disturbances andto further British trade throughout the world.(e) To provide forces for use under the Security Council if called upon todo so.18. At Annex I we give in detail the commitments for which it is consideredthat specific allowance should be made in 1948.We have assumed that by this date we shall have no further commitments in Austria, Italy, Venezia Giulia or Greece, nor have we made any allowance for forces in the ex-Italian Colonies. It is considered, however, that we must continue to make allowance for forces, not necessarily of all three Services ineach of the followingGermany.Palestine, Iraq and the Sudan.India and Ceylon.Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong and Japan.Certain other stations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Aden.Naval forces will be necessary both in Home Waters and in theMediterranean, Indian and Pacific Oceans. In addition allowance has been madefor small naval forces in outlying areas such as the West Indies and SouthAfrica.The forces required for the above will need an adequate scale of adminis-trative and training backing in the United Kingdom.Minimum Forces required to meet 1948 commitments19. At Annexes II, III and IV we give detailed estimates of the minimumforces which each of the Services would require at 31st March, 1948, adequatelyto meet the commitments shown above. In many cases the forces necessary forour overseas commitments would, in fact, also provide for our initial defence in war and serve as a basis for expansion. Full allowance has been made forthis.These forces expressed in terms of trained personnel (including Women&apos;services) would be : Navy       ............... 194,000Army      ............... 611,800R.A.F................ 299,000In giving these figures, we would emphasise that whereas those for the navy and E.A.F. represent our tentative estimates for the ultimate peace-time strengths of these two Services, that of the Army is virtually confined to its commitments on 31st March, 1948, and will show a considerable reduction when we canreturn to more normal peacetime conditions.Man-power considerations20. Because of present and projected policy governing release and call-upfor the Services and because of the time required to build up the regular contents,the full figures shown above cannot be reached in 1948. The effect of these con-siderations on the forces which the Navy and R.A.F. will be able to provide at31st March, 1948, are shown in Annexes II and IV. This has not been done forthe Army since its strength at that date is directly related to the fulfilment of overseas commitments and no planned reduction below that figure can be made without a directive on what commitments can be abandoned.The Naval Annex shows what forces could, in fact, be made available withinthe restricted man-power ceilings which have been put forward for planning purposes,* i.e., 162,800 trained men and the extent to which these forces will fail to meet our commitments. It also shows that, taking into consideration theprobable intake of volunteers and the expected rates of releases and call-up ofconscripts, the optimum figure of trained personnel that oan be reached by March1948. is 164,000. . .The R.A.F. Annex shows that the practical consideration governing the size of the R.A.F. at March 1948 is the likely availability of trained man-power ratherthan commitments to be met.   Owing to the losses of trained men already suffered,* Man-Power Working Committee Scheme D.
and likely to continue for the next two years as the result of the release pro-gramme, a disproportionate number of the trained men available now has had toto be put into the technical training organisation at the expense of the frontline. Thus with the total trained personnel now likely to be available a frontline of only the equivalent of 90 squadrons, at a low state of efficiency, can bemaintained until after 1949, as opposed to the minimum of 150 squadronsprovisionally estimated as necessary. The Annex explains the measures necessaryto make good the technical training backlog, to avoid further contraction and toplace the R.A.F. in a position to restore the front line in due course to an effectivestrength commensurate with its responsibilities. To fulfil these purposes theR.A.F. will need a total of 150,000 trained men at 31st&apos; March, 1948.21. We estimate, therefore, that the trained personnel (including Women&apos;services) likely to be required on 31st March. 1948, are : Navy: 164,000 (i.e., the figure which it is estimated that it will bepossible to reach by that date in the build-up to the figure considered necessary).Air Force: 250,000.Army : 611,800 (i.e., the figure estimated as necessary to enable them tomeet their commitments).We would emphasise again that, as far as the Navy and Air Force are con-cerned, these figures in no sense represent the forces which we consider necessary,nor will the forces that they can sustain meet our requirements and commitments.Summary22. We have shown in paragraph 19 the approximate total number of trained personnel which we would need in the Services on 31st March, 1948,adequately to meet strategic requirements. We have also shown in paragraph 20and in the Annexes that the ability of the Services to reach these numbers, thoughpartly conditioned by the likely intake of volunteers, has been prejudiced bycurrent and projected call-up and release policies which affect both the numbersof trained men remaining with the Services and the numbers and value of theyearly intakes of conscripts. Another important factor is tihe different value which each Service can derive from its conscript entries.The allocation of our available man-power resources to and between theServices through 1947 thus presents a very intricate problem. Any arbitraryalteration of the figures quoted in paragraph 21 will have widely differing resultson the ability of each Service to meet its commitments, consolidate its positionand provide for further expansion where necessary. We consider, therefore, thatno firm decision on strengths should be made until the Man-Power Committeehave examined the possibility of meeting at least the requirements of the service as shown in paragraph 21.* * * * * i*
DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1947Copy Noi fj $cabinet defence Committee,   PRODUCTION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES,1947-48Report by the Production Committee1. In September 1946, the Prime Minister informed the Service ministers and the Minister of Supply in a minute dealing with the preparation of service estimates for the next financial year of his intention to set up an ad hocMinisterial Production Committee, and asked that the following papers shouldbe prepared and laid before this Committee : -(a) An agreed inter-Service programme for defence research and develop-inent;(6) A report stating the dimensions of the Production Estimates for 1947-48in sufficient detail to enable the Production Committee to see themain elements which go to make up the programmes.These papers were to be drawn up by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee andthe Joint War Production Staff respectively, and were to be examined by theProduction Committee as a preliminary to subsequent discussions in the DefenceCommittee.2. Later, in view. of the publication of the White Paper on central organisation for Defence and of the establishment of the Ministry of Defence, thePrime Minister agreed that the Minister of Defence should assume the chairman-ship of the ad hoc committee, which has in fact become merged with the StandingMinisterial Production Committee contemplated in paragraph 27 of the white paper.3. The reports prepared by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee and theJoint War Production Staff have been closely scrutinised by the MinisterialProduction Committee. As a result of that scrutiny certain reductions, substan-tial in the case of the Production Estimates, and amounting in total to some 35 million, have been made.Parts I and II below summarise the modified proposals which we recommendfor the approval of the Defence Committee.Part I, Research and Development4. The following table summarises our financial proposals under this head.The figures include expenditure on works services associated with research anddevelopment. m.Admiralty...............       ...       ...        8-5Ministry of Supply (Defence) (including  in. 9-4 foratomic energy)       ....      ....      ...       ...       ...      22-ministry of Supply (Air) ...       ......       ...      35-2Total    ...      ......      ...      ...      ...      66 15.   Generally speaking, the programmes put forward by Departments arein large measure a legacy of the war, though some reorientation of effort in suchnew directions as biological warfare and guided projectiles has been found possible in spite of limitations imposed by shortage of scientific man-power and[32979] &apos; BfeECRETD.O. (17) 57th January, 1947
of building labour and materials. With the establishment of the defence research Policy Committee and the appointment of Sir Henry Tizard as itschairman, progress may be expected during the course of the coming year inthe formulation of a fully integrated research and development programme whichwill be in step with the latest concepts of strategic and operational thought. Itis, however, unlikely that any very drastic changes will be immediatelypracticable, as the formulation of a new policy will be a continuing processextending over a number of years, and in any case changes would not be reflectedquickly in financial estimates.6. The following is a summary of some of the more important items uponwhich research and development is now proceeding : \-Admiralty(a) Anti-submarine detection and new weapons-of attack.(b) The development of a fast submarine to provide targets on which todevelop counter-measures.(c) Problems connected with providing protection against attack by veryfast aircraft.(d) Carrier operating problems in connection with the use of new fastaircraft.(e) Constructional problems in the light of information which will become available as a result of ship target trials.(/) Ship propulsion problems including the development of gas turbines formarine propulsion.(g) Guided missile problems in conjunction with the Ministry of Supply.(h) Mining problems, particularly in relation to counter-measures.(j) Radar and Radio problems, including counter-measures.II. Ministry of Supply (Defence)(a) Basic research in the following fields : (i) Explosives, propellants and fuels,(ii) Metallurgy,(iii) Chemical warfare.. (iv) Biological warfare.(b) New light and heavy anti-aircraft artillery equipment, including rocketsand unorthodox weapons.(c) Improvement of fire power and mobility in Army field artillery and anti-aircraft guns. New range of small arms standardised on the American-30&quot; cartridge.(d) Radar in connection with anti-aircraft problems for field army purposes.(e) Problems connected with V.T. (Proximity) fuzes.(/:) Problems connected with providing improved armoured vehicles of greater fighting power and mobility, B vehicles for special army requirements, and a new range of wheeled transport vehicles for all services.(g) Improvement of engineering equipment for bridging and rafting, road-making and clearance of mine fields.(h) Development of very high frequency radio sets for military use.III. Ministry of Supply (Air)(a) Aerodynamics : researches essential for the development of high speedflight and of guided weapons.(b) Problems connected with production of materials such as turbine blades,light and steel alloys.(c) Aero engines, mainly gas turbines.(d) Radio and radar equipment for control of guided weapons and high-speed pilotless aircraft, for navigation and for detection of ships and aircraft.(e) Air frames for new long-range and high-speed bombers and for newhigh-speed R.A.F. and naval day and night interceptors.(/) Armaments.7. In considering Part III Of tlhe above list, the following points shouldbe borne in mind :-(i) In aeronautics, research work is wholly, and development work largely,beneficial to the entire field of aviation;
(ii) The work on Airframes includes a considerable expenditure of effort on the development of hew types of naval aircraft to replace theAmerican types on which we were very largely dependent at the endof the war;(iii.) The work on items (a) to (c) above is almost wholly basic and applied research.8. In view of the great importance which is attached to research anddevelopment, and of the fact that the present programmes are of an interimnature only, we have not felt it incumbent upon us to make proposals for modi-fying their general content and direction; they will no doubt undergo some modification during the course of the financial year as a result of the investiga-tions of the Defence Research Policy Committee.9. In recommending the figures in paragraph 4 for the approval of theDefence Committee, we wish to draw attention to the fact that the programmes of the Ministry of Supply (Defence) and Ministry of Supply (Air) provide forcertain items of research and development which do not strictly appertain to defence. This point is more fully developed in the Memorandum by the Ministerof Defence dealing with Service Estimates (D.O. (47) 4).10. We wish to bring to the notice of the Defence Committee the followingimportant points concerning defence research and development to which our attention has been drawn by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee: (i) Research and development is being generally hampered by shortage of trained scientific man-power. This shortage is particularly acutein certain fields such as biological warfare,(ii) A large number of research and development establishments are out of date and unsuitable for modern needs. All departments have heavyrequirements for new works, but difficulties of labour and materialsupply preclude any rapid progress. The Admiralty appears to be particularly badly off in this respect.(iii) The effort being put into basic research and new types of weaponsappears insufficient. We understand that this is due in part to shortageof scientists and of facilities for building work and in part to thedifficulty of making any rapid alteration in the programmes of research and development now under way.We do not propose to put forward any positive suggestions for remedyingthis state of affairs at the present stage, but recommend that the newly establishedDefence Research Policy Committee be requested to examine it and to report tothe Minister of Defence in due course.Part II.-Production11. In the absence of a common strategical background and of any firm decisions as to the size of the post-war Navy, Army and Air Force, we haveobserved the following principles in reviewing the report submitted by the JointWar Production Staff :-(i) First, we have confirmed that all three Service Departments are con-tinuing to make all possible use of existing stocks with the object of reducing their demands on new production to a minimum, and thatthey fully appreciate the fact that in the interests of economy and the revival of trade there must be a delay in the replacement of obsolescentequipment.(ii) Secondly, we are satisfied that the requirements include only items : (a) Which are absolutely essential for immediate current needs;(b) Which are compatible with foreseeable changes in design of equipment;(c) Which must be included in order to maintain essential nucleus war potential by the retention of production capacity and themaintenance of manufacturing technique which it would in thelong run be uneconomical to disperse.The main elements of the Service Programmes are set out in the following paragraphs.Admiralty12.   The main elements of the Admiralty requirements, which total  70-9million, are shown at Annex I.    Thev are based on little more than bare[32979] B 2
maintenance of the existing fleet and the continuation of the construction of ships already being built. Some provision is made for the replacement of the obsoleteaircraft with which the Naval Air Arm is equipped to-day. In the interests of economy, until the lessons of the late war have been applied and the results of thecurrent programme in research and development are known, it is not proposed to institute a programme for the modernisation of the fleet, and for the same reason it is not intended to commence production yet on new types of equipment.13. The ship repair programme provides for maintenance of the active fleet at minimum level and for beginning the refitting of the large number of ships which because of man-power shortages had to be put into reserve without their normal refit. This is urgently necessary if the reserve fleet is not to suffer serious deterioration.Naval A viation14. We have closely examined the requirements of naval aviation and at ourinstance the number of combat aircraft for which the Admiralty proposes to indenthas been considerably reduced from the original figure. In relation to front-line strength, the demand is apparently proportionately much in excess of that ofthe Royal Air Force. The programmes of rearmament are not directlycomparable, however. In addition the Admiralty has represented that the air-craft with which the Naval Air Arm was equipped during the war were largelyAmerican, and that its British types are relatively more obsolete than those inthe R.A.F.; furthermore, many of them were never designed to operate from air-craft carriers, and consequently the accident rate is high and they are mostuneconomical to maintain. In view of these factors, we are satisfied that thismuch reduced requirement is reasonable.[N.B. Subsequent to the examination of the Admiralty&apos;s requirements bythe Production Committee there have been further discussions between theMinistry of Defence and the Admiralty. As a result of these discussions theAdmiralty has agreed to reduce certain services, designed to ensure that the nettotal of the estimates does not exceed  195 million (excluding terminal charges).These modifications will affect the production programme to an extent estimated to involve a reduction of  4- 4-J million approximately in the figure quoted inparagraph 12, but in the time available it has not been possible to indicate exactlyhow this will be spread over the headings in Annex I. The Admiralty&apos;s pro-duction demand will thus become  66-7 million approximately.The Admiralty have emphasised that the services thus modified are allessential to the efficiency of the Navy and will need ultimately to be carried out,some of them at increased expense.]War Office15. The principal items in the War Office total of  66-101 million are shown at Annex II. The bulk of this programme is essential maintenance. Someeffort is expended on keeping factory capacity in being, particularly in the caseof lightened infantry weapons. A lesser element is included for new equipment,the largest and most important items of which are the latest type of heavy A.Aand associated equipments, which are essential for the air defence of this country.New Lightened Infantry Weapons16. We questioned the necessity for making any provision for productionof these weapons, which we were informed were not essential for immediatemilitary purposes, though better than existing types. The justification for theorder is the need, in the interests of the country&apos;s war potential, to maintainindustrial capacity and manufacturing technique in the field of small arms. Itis hoped in the near future to produce designs of rifles and light automaticsstandardised with the United States. This capacity will then be switched to theproduction of these new weapons. If it is allowed to disappear and the skilled labour is dispersed, it would take at least three years to restart production. we agree with the Joint War Production Staff that this capacity must be kept in being at the minimum level, but have made a reduction of  200,000 in the financial provision.Armoured Fighting Vehicles17. At their fourth meeting* the Defence Committee agreed that tank pro-duction should be maintained at the minimum required to keep two tank factories in operation; this minimum rate is 20 per month, i.e., 240 a year.* B.O. (46) 4th Meeting, Minute 1.
India has now placed an order for 86 tanks. To maintain the two factories in operation, therefore, the War Office requirement could be reduced to 154 tanks.The implications of this cut are :  (a) Even at the rate of 240 a year, it will take 12 years to re-equip the regularArmy plus 50 per cent, reserves and a further four years to provide theTerritorial Army with training scales only.(6) The Army is at present equipped with American and British tanks. TheAmerican tanks are virtually useless, as it is impossible to get furtherspares.   There are sufficient British tanks of obsolete pattern to equipi1 the regular Army, but if the Army is re-equipping at the rate of only240 tanks a year, many of those of obsolete pattern will be over 10 years old before replacement and very uneconomical to maintain.(c) The effect of giving up 86 tanks this year, assuming that production inother years is not raised above 240 a year, will be to increase stillfurther the unreadiness of the Army for modern battle during the next12 years or so.Undesirable as it may be to delay the re-equipment of the Army, havingregard to the present stringency and to the financial advantages of sale to India,we feel compelled to endorse the recommendation of the Joint War production staff that the War Office order should be reduced to 154 tanks. We must, how-ever, add the supplementary recommendation that next year the production of tanks on account of the Army should be increased to offset this reduction.Air Ministry18. The total Air Ministry requirement of  63 million is summarised at annex III. This does little more than set on foot a modest rearmament in types of aircraft which will be required for the air defence of the country, begin the replacement of American transport aircraft and of British aircaft unsuitable for carriage of airborne forces, and maintain at minimum level the industrial capacity for production of heavy bombers. Some provision is also made for the replacement of obsolete training aircraft with modern types, a requirement of fundamental importance to the efficiency of the post-war air forces.Production Possibilities19. We have considered whether it would be possible to carry through theproduction programmes summarised in this report in their entirety in thefinancial year 1947-48. Owing to acute shortages in certain raw materials andin man-power we are of the opinion that there will inevitably be a shortfall onthese programmes. We accept the view of the Joint War Production Staff thatthis shortfall will be of the order of 8 per cent., involving a carry-over of this magnitude into 1948-49. It is not possible, however, to determine at this stage the items on which the shortfalls will occur; we recommend, therefore, that the programmes set out in Annexes I, II and III attached should be approved as they stand but that the financial provision to be made in departmental estimates should allow for an overall shortfall of 8 per cent., Departments being givenfreedom to make detailed adjustments within their reduced global totals. Onthis basis, the totals to be allocated for expenditure by or on behalf of theService Departments, after allowing for the further cut in the Admiraltyprogramme mentioned in the note to paragraph 14, are :   millionAdmiralty       ...............      61-war Office       ...............      60-8Air Ministry   .........       ...       ...      58-0Total    ............      ...     180-4.20. We desire to bring to the notice of the Defence Committee the following-important points which have emerged from our examination of the productionrequirements of the Services for next financial year : A. ReservesThe estimates put forward in this paper make no provision for war reservesm the shape of new equipment or for the completion of reserves in existingweapons where present stocks are insufficient. The only exception is that whereR.A.F. combat squadrons are being re-equipped with new types, provision hasbeen made for war reserves amounting to one montlhs wastage at war rates.
B. ModernisationIt will be observed that none of the Services proposes to initiate in the next financial year a policy of modernisation on any but the most modest scale. In theinterests of an efficient national defence, we desire to emphasise the dangers ofindefinite delay in the re-equipment of the forces. As experience between thetwo wars showed, if modernisation is delayed too long there comes a time whenthe lag is so great that the forces cannot be re-equipped and prepared for warshort of embarking on a rearmament programme which must necessarily beextravagant and may perhaps through its political reactions lead to the vastexpense of war itself. Ideally, the process of modernisation should be continuous,though the individual needs of each Service will vary according to the type of itsequipment and its span of useful life; furthermore, in order to obtain themaximum benefits from research and development, it is essential to try out new types of equipment with the forces from time to time; this especially applies to aircraft and tanks. In addition, there is a point at which it is more economicalin the long-run to spend money on new equipment rather than on the maintenanceof obsolete types which become progressively more expensive to maintain inserviceable condition. The stagnation imposed by the policy adopted in preparingthis year&apos;s production estimates should therefore not be allowed to continue any longer than is absolutely necessary.C. Future Production planning the Joint War^ Production Staff has reported that its first joint study ofthe three Service Production Estimates has convinced it that the principlesobserved in their preparation require urgent review. With the exception of theprocedure under which the Admiralty obtain approval for their long-term plans for new warship construction, the three Services are dependent on a year-by-yearallocation of funds, and consequently it is not possible for the Supply Depart-ments to go to industry in anticipation of continuing orders, nor to order in themost econ; &apos; al manner. The Joint War Production Staff takes the view thatthis procedure is now out of date for the following reasons : (a) The point when we must undertake the modernisation of our armed forces, as has been already pointed out, cannot be indefinitely delayed.If this modernisation is to be achieved with the maximum efficiency and economy, phased production programmes covering a number ofyears must be put into effect at an early date. These should beintegrated with the results of long-term research and development programmes as the latter mature.(b) Production programmes for complex equipment are inflexible becauserates of output can change only slowly. Hence the requirements of later years must be taken into account in planning a particular year&apos;programme. The manufacture of jigs and tools and the other essentialpreliminaries for production on an economic scale occupy more thanone year. Small orders for stores which can be mass-produced are extremely uneconomical.(c) For the reasons in (b) above, industry is increasingly unwilling to acceptcontracts on a short-term annual basis with no reasonable certainty that they will be followed up by further orders in subsequent years.The Ministry of Defence is now examining the implications of a system underwhich Service Departments will submit for approval programmes covering anumber of years and thus enable the Supply Departments to plan continuousprogrammes. Its report will be laid before us in due course, and we shall thenmake appropriate recommendations to the Defence Committee.Foreign Orders21. We would draw attention to the fact that, in addition to the foregoingrequirements, there will be demands of some magnitude for munitions on theUnited Kingdom by and on behalf of the Dominions. India and foreign countries.In terms of money they amount to : Admiralty ...War office air Ministry  million410 1167-3Total21-416
These will also be susceptible to the overall production shortfall of 8 per cent,(see paragraph 19). The cost will, of course, be recoverable, except in the case ofa Canadian order for aircraft and equipment to the approximate value.of 2 million, which represents the value of a credit accumulated for the benefitof Canada from the disposal of Canadian aircraft to the E.A.F. The man-power required for the fulfilment of these orders, numbering some 48,000, is countedagainst the allocation to the export trade, and not against that for serviceproduction. It has therefore been excluded from the figures given in paragraph 23below.22. The figures in paragraph 21 include certain prospective demands for combat aircraft by foreign purchasers who have-not yet placed firm orders.If these are to be met, it is necessary to plan production now, as the orders willbe secured only if early delivery can be offered. The Ministry of Supply has no powers to order such aircraft on its own account, and it is therefore necessary toinclude them in the R.A.F. and Naval Aviation requirements. The number of aircraft involved is approximately 200, of which 150 are R.A.F. types and 50Naval types. The approximate total cost is  5 million. In view of the greatimportance of increasing our export trade in armaments, and so of maintaining our war potential, we recommend that authority be given to plan production andto place contracts with industry on the basis that these orders will be forthcoming.If they do not mature, the aircraft can be used by the Royal Navy and the R.A.F.,and will correspondingly reduce their own future production requirements. no increase in the net totals of Service Estimates for 1947-48 will be necessary; thecost of any of these aircraft which are not sold to foreign customers and have tobe accepted by the Navy or R.A.F. will be found from savings elsewhere.Man-Power23. The man-power ceiling for Service production at 31st December, 1948,approved by the Cabinet is 500,000. The man-power required to execute therequirements outlined in this paper (allowing for an 8 per cent, shortfall on production) is as follows : Research and Development ...       ...       ...      ... 46,000Production      .................. 408,000Processing and packing of food, drink and tobaccofor the Services   ...       ...       ...      ...      ... 20,000Total ...............     474,000Summary of Recommendations24.--We recommend that the defence Committee should-(i) Approve the research and  development programmes outlined  inPart I of this paper, and a money provision of  66-1 million (includ-ing the cost of associated works).(ii) Take note of the points raised in paragraph 10 and request the defence research Policy Committee to consider them.;(iii) Approve the production requirements outlined in Part II of this paper,and the money provision of  180 - 4 million proposed in paragraph 19.(iv) Approve the planning of production and placing of contracts for air-craft on the basis that the foreign orders mentioned in paragraph 22will be forthcoming,(v) Approve the man-power allocation of 474,000 (excluding that requiredto meet foreign orders) for service production and research anddevelopment in the financial year 1947-18.(vi) Take note of the points raised in paragraph 20, and request the Ministerof Defence to keep them in mind when considering future plans.(Initialled) A.

In addition thereis likely to be a new construction programme involving expen-diture in 1947-48 of approximately  330,000. Total expendi-ture under this heading (after deduction of expenditure on  Naval Armament Stores included in (e) below) is ...      ...    13,732,000(b) New Construction other than WarshipsThis provision is for necessary new construction to main-tain efficient Naval Ancillary Services plus expenditure tocomplete the small balance of war-time merchant shipbuildingon Government account   ...       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      1,888,000(c) Ship RepairingThe repair programme of ships in both the active and reserve fleets is badly in arrears. The bulk of repairs will becarried out in H.M. Dockyards. The total expenditure underthis heading includes approximately  2,700,000 in respect of repairs in H.M. Dockyards abroad and approximately 3,500,000 for overhead labour. Repairs in dockyards abroad and a small proportion of the cost of repairs by contract over-seas will not make a call on United Kingdom production capacity      ...      ............      .........     15,679,000(d) Technical EquipmentProvision is limited to necessary equipment for existingships and shore establishments; the existing moratorium onputting new types of equipment into production is maintained      4,421,000(e) Naval Armament stores in addition to the outfitting of warship new construction,the proposed provision of ammunition, torpedoes, mines anddepth charges (including components of these items) represents a minimum demand on production to maintain stocks, after full allowance is made for the use of existing stocks equivalent to nearly 50 per cent, of the total requirement   ...      ...      ...      6,384,000(/) Machinery (other than for new construction)The objective here is to provide the minimum of new machinery and equipment to maintain full working efficiency in ships and shore establishments, and in addition such machinery as is required for improvement of living conditionsafloat and ashore   ....      ...      ......,.       ...      ...      ...      6,100,000(g) Naval Aviation Requirements(i) Aircraft (425 combat and 26 non-com-bat, plus backlog of 70 aircraft from1946-47,   and   spare   engines   (seeNate (i))        .......      ...... 7,100,000(Note (ii)).  .

&quot;3fa *l el(A) Non-Warlike Stores  (i) Maintenance Stores.Comprises materials and miscellaneous stores for upkeepof the Fleet and shore establishments. Over a large proportionof the range of general stores it is estimated that 33 per cent,of the total requirements for 1947-48 will not be required from -production, but will be met from stocks. Out of the provisionproposed in 1947-48, materials and stores to the value ofapproximately  3 million are for the repair programme in dock-yards. Furniture and furnishings required in ships and shore .establishments to improve Service amenities, account for approximatly  1 million ...          ...   ...      ...       ...       ...      5,983,000(ii) Motor Transport &apos;Out of the total provision under this heading only 10 percent, is for new vehicles, the major part representing repairs and spares   .........       .........       ...       ...       1,361,000(iii) Clothing, Mess Gear and Medical Stores.The principal item under this heading is clothing and personal equipment (beds, bedding, &amp;c.) to a value of 2,906,000, including  500,000 in respect of demobilisationclothing. Proposed purchases of goods in civilian demand havebeen restricted to the minimum consistent with workingefficiency. Stocks of Service (i.e., non-civilian) pattern con-stitute relief of production to the extent of (a) 10 per cent, oftotal requirements in the case of mess gear, and (b) 50 per cent,for clothing. After 1947-48 it will only be possible to meet a diminishing portion of such requirements from surplus stocks      3,329,000Net Admiralty requirement        ...       ...       ...     70,877,000N.B.

This large sum isnecessitated by the fact that the Army is living on its stocks.In addition, it is proposed that the Ministry of Supply shouldoverhaul 20,000 load-carrying vehicles, 10,000 engines and3,600 motor cycles-this accounts for  4,422,000. Theremainder of this sub-head, amounting to  613,000, includes 440,000 for the completion of a contract for airportabletrucks which are to replace American equipment, the balancebeing for a small quantity of a new range of vehicles for trooptrials.Total sub-head      .,.............     11,497,000(e) Technical Equipment 3,653,000 is required for technical equipment for theA.A.

Normal maintenance (battledress, footwear, &amp;c.)accounts for the balance.Wastage rates, scales of issue, level of resources and working stocks, which were approved by the Defence Com-mittee after Professor Plants investigation, have been followed and all stocks which the Army were allowed to retain after thatinvestigation have been taken into account as assets.On the other hand, where the Army were called upon to surrender stocks surplus to their requirements up to 31stMarch, 1947, their 1947-48 requirements have had to be addedin full. The major items surrendered included oyer 1,000,000pairs of boots and over 2,000,000 pairs of socks.Total sub-head.........      ......      6,989,000(h) General StoresThis sub-head covers a vast range of stores of all sorts fromironmongery to crockery : from furniture to camp equipment:from metals, paint, &amp;c, to beds, cutlery and household utensils.It includes  2,500,000 as the second instalment of a  15 million
programme for provision of improved furniture, householdutensils, &amp;e.,: to go some way to raising Service amenities to the civilian level. It also includes  1,700,000 for packaging stores in ordnance depots at home and abroad to reduce deterioration in store and wastage in transit, to facilitate store accountingand save man-power by standardisation of packaging.

The main features may be summarised as under : New Aircraft(a) Day Fighters. The progressive rearmament of the fighter force with jet-propelled aircraft. If the1947-48 scale of production is continued this will becompleted in 1950. The vital role of the fighterforce in the defence of the United Kingdom and itsrelatively small size makes its re-equipment withthe most modern aircraft essential.(b) Transports. Jt is necessary to replace the AmericanDakotas now being returned under the terminationof lend-lease arrangements with a medium-rangetransport aircraft of British manufacture, and toavoid further reliance on American sources with the consequential liability for dollar expenditure.Present long-range transport aircraft (Yorks) areunsuitable for airborne assault duties because theycannot be used for paratrooping or the carriage of heavy Army equipment, such as guns, jeeps, &amp;c. Areplacement is therefore required, but it is unlikelythat the long-range transport and the AirborneEorces Squadrons will be completely re-equipped with Hastings until 1949.(c) Trainers. The replacement of obsolete trainers by a modern type. This provision is an essential corollaryto the modernisation of the front-line forces,&quot;and isof prime importance to the efficiency of the post-warair force.[32979] I)
