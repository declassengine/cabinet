J.    -Colonial Office, S.W. 1.7th January,  1947.
USE OP THE ARMED FORCES IN PALESTINE1. Discussion in 1938 on the relative powers and responsibilities of the Military and Civil Authoritiesregarding action to be taken in the event of disturbances inPalestine reached the following conclusion (Meeting ofMinisters,  13th October,  1938   SP(38)  1)*      &quot;The constitutional position of the High Commissioner as head of the civil government must remain unchanged, and it follows that on any matter whichmay produce major political repercussions it will be necessaryfor the General Officer Commanding to consult the HighCommissioner and only act if the High Commissioner agrees&quot;.2. This principle was reaffirmed in June I9h6 at thetime when action was being prepared against the terroristorganisations and the leaders of the Jewish Agency who wereimplicated in the organisation of acts of violence.      Thefollowing Directive was sent to the High Commissioner:&quot;In the circumstances contemplated, finalresponsibility rests with you as Head of theCivil Government after the Minister of Defencehas decided that such action is appropriate.^In that event either you will request theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East,  to take certain&apos; action or he will seek your agreement to take such action.      Executive orders to troops concerned will, of course, be the responsibility of theCommander-in-Chief, but these will not be given without your prior concurrence in the course ofaction proposed.      The decision whether theaction you desire is practicable with the forces available and in the light of other commitmentsremains with the Commander-in-Chief in view ofhis wider sphere of responsibility.&quot;3. No modification to these . instructions indicating achange of policy has been sent to the High Commissioner.      InSeptember 19/4-6 he reported that in all action which had beentaken against terrorism the provisions of this Directive hadbeen scrupulously observed and that no major military action had been undertaken without his permission,.      He described his policy in applying this Directive as follows:&quot;The Army can only take action without previouspermission if the local situation demands it,e.g.  the imposition of a curfew in an area which an illegal ship is believed to be making for,or small-scale searches for terrorists.      in deciding whether to take military action on a^    The decision was taken by the Cabinet in June 194-6(C.M.(h6) 60th Conclusions) that the High commissioner should be authorised to take such steps as he considered necessary to break up the illegal organisations inPalestine,  including the arrest of certain personsconnected with the Jewish Agency, but that he should not attempt  it that stage to secure the wholesale disarmingof individuals.      Action to this end was taken on the29th June,  1946,
mlarge-scale,  I have been influenced bythe following factors:(a) that there should be as littleinterference as possible with thecivil life of the communities 5(b) that military action should never be in the nature of reprisals,but that it should have adefinite object against illegalorganisati ons;(c) that it should only be taken onreliable information. &quot;4. At the meeting of the Defence Committee onthe 1st January,  1947 (D.0.(47) 1st meeting) the view was expressed that to continue this policy inPalestine in present circumstances placed the armed forces in an impossible position.      I was accordinglyinvited to draw up a new Directive to the HighCommissioner for Palestine in the light of the discussion at the Defence Committee in consultation with the WarOffice and the High Commissioner for Palestine.      Itwas found possible to arrange a discussion betweenmyself,  the High Commissioner for Palestine and theChief of the Imperial General Staff, before the latterleft this country,  at which a revised Directive was drawn up and agreed.      The Directive forms the annex to this paper.5. For the information of my colleagues,  I mayadd that vigorous steps are being taken in palestine to reorganise the police force and to increase their numbers.      The effect of these measures will heincreasingly apparent..6. I recommend:(a) that  the revised Directive annexed tothis paper be issued to the HighCommissioner for Palestine;(b) that final responsibility for thenature of the action taken to implementthis Directive remain with the HighCommissioner for Palestine as Headof the Civil government (c) that the High Commissioner be invitedto concert with the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, such action ashe considers appropriate for theimmediate implementation of  the revised Directive.
ANNEXDIRECTIVE TO HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR PALESTINEON THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES  IN the suppression OF TERRORISM1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that further efforts will he made to stop lawlessness and terrorism.2. They have also decided that all possible stepswill he taken at once to establish and maintain law andorder in Palestine,  using the police and military forcesat your disposal as may be necessary.5. There can of course be no question of takingreprisals which would merely bear hardly on innocent people.Apart from this, the efforts of police and troops should be designed to take the offensive against breakers of the lawand to ensure that the initiative lies with the forces ofthe Crown.4. Such action as you take to implement the policy outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3 above will receive the full support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.-3-
