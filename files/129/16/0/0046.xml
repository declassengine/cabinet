DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 194730uSECRETCP. (47) 46\$th January, 1947Copy No.     2 9CABINET.CONSULTATION  WITH  THE  TRADES  UNION CONGRESSMemorandum by the Prime minister in October 1939 Mr. Chamberlain circulated a memorandum, of which acopy is attached, to all Ministers, on the above subject.2. In August 1940 Mr. Churchill brought this memorandum to the notice ofMinisters again, with a note stating that it was his wish &quot; that they should arrange, wherever possible, for consultation and collaboration with the TradesUnion Congress or individual Trades Unions on all matters which are felt to concern them.&quot;3. I wish again to remind my colleagues that they should be vigilant in ensuring that the T.U.C. and in suitable cases individual Trades Unions- are fully taken into consultation wherever appropriate at the earliest possible stage.Such consultation does not involve any derogation from the Governmentsresponsibility to Parliament, and, if it is carried out properly, its results can be only beneficial.4. It is clearly not possible to lay down hard and fast rules, and individual ministers must judge cases on their merits. But there are clearly two broadclasses on which consultation should take place : (a) Matters of general Industrial Policy and PrincipleWhere an individual industry is involved and the question does not raisewider issues of principle, the appropriate Trade Union (or Unions) would be theight body to consult; but where cases affecting individual Trade Unions raisesues affecting industry as a whole, the General Council of the T.U.C. should beionsulted. Even in cases in which consultation with individual Trade Unions isthe appropriate course the General Secretary of the T.U.C. should normally bekept informed.33108
This does not invalidate any arrangements specially made for example, for consultation with the Rationing and Food Price Committee of the T.U.C. even jwhere only an individual industry is in question.Furthermore, Ministers may &quot;find it of great assistance to meet from time to 3time the Economic Committee or other appropriate Committee of the T.U.C. fia general talk on matters of mutual interest, even though no immediate individual Bproblem arises.There are many matters under this head which are the concern of employers jand workers jointly, and in such cases the proper course is to arrange for the joint Bfconsultation through one of the existing joint bodies, e.g., the National Joint 1Advisory Council over which the Minister of Labour and National Service pre- Isides, and the National Production Advisory Council for Industry, presided over Hby the President of the Board of Trade.(b) Appointments to Government Bodies, &amp;c.These are of three kinds : (i) An official representative of the T.U.C.(ii) A member of the T.U.C. chosen in his personal capacity.(iii) A representative of Labour as a class and not as an organisation.In the first category the procedure is clear, namely, that the General councils asked to nominate, though there may be need on particular occasion to consiit on the suitability of its nominee.   As regards the second category, when the Iperson whom it is proposed to appoint has been chosen, although in a personal capacity, because he is a trade unionist, the T.U.C. should be consulted.  In casesfalling within this category the practice should be to ensure that the General secretary of the T.U.C. is consulted informally in the first instance before any necessary formal approach is made to the General Council.  In cases in the third jcategory the T.U.C. should be consulted informally through the General Secretary Iin the case of any person who is within the active trade union movement.  Wherea member with a labour background is appointed to the Board of a socialised &apos;industry the Minister concerned must accept full responsibility for the appoint- Iment and accordingly any consultation with the T.U.C. would be of an inform.il -character.Even in cases where another category of appointment is involved, namely, an appointment by individual Trade Unions, there may sometimes be an aclvanta.in keeping the General Secretary of the T.U.C. in. touch so that the T.U.C. m i   .Vhelp if necessary in ensuring the appointment of the best man.   Great care must :]be exercised in such cases, however, to avoid creating the impression that a jUnion&apos;s nomination is subject to confirmation by the T.U.C., since this may bring 1into question the Union&apos;s authority in such matters.The above is, of course, without prejudice to the existing position about 9appointments to quasi-judicial bodies, where there are great objections to offic -consultation with any organisation and the Government must be free to appoint a
whom they regard as most suitable without raising suspicions as to bias.f personI  ven iLjth the[be unfettered right of the Government to appoint the person they desire.C. R A.n these cases it is open for any purely personal consultation to take placelie General Secretary of the T.U.C. without in any way interfering with10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,30th January, 1947.annex memorandum circulated by Mr. Chamberlain in October 1939THE Prime Minister recently received a Deputation from the general council of the Trades Union Congress with regard to the position of the TradesUnion Movement in relation to the Defence Programme and other emergency measures.The complaint was made by the Deputation that, in certain instances, action had been taken and regulations issued by Departments of concern to the TradesUnion Movement without any form of prior consultation with the Movement. ThePrime Minister emphasised the desire of the Government that there should be themost complete understanding and co-operation possible between departments and the Movement and assured the Deputation that, if there had been omissions,these had been due to inadvertence at a time of great stress.The Prime Minister is sure that all his colleagues will share his desire toensure the full co-operation of the Trades Union Movement in the national effortfor the prosecution of the war. He hopes, therefore, that they will be ready toarrange where possible for the Trades Union Congress (or individual trades union where this is more appropriate) to be consulted in advance on all matters which are felt to concern them.
