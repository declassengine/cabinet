DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1947SECRETCP. (47) 94th January, 1947Copy No.   9 QCABINETJAPANESE REPARATIONS DEADLOCKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs desire to consult my colleagues on the subject of the deadlock which hasbeen reached over Allied policy towards Japanese reparations and regarding theattitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt towards th^ latest proposals for solving the problem which have been put forward by the UnitedStates Government.2. The facts of the situation, with recommendations, are contained in aMemorandum prepared by the Chairman of the Far Eastern (Official) Committeewhich is attached at Annex A. The recommendation of the Far Eastern (Official)Committee, contained in paragraph 6 of the Chairman&apos;s Memorandum, is thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should support the United States Government if theydecide to adopt the course of action contemplated.3. The United States proposal appears to offer the only immediate, practical solution of this long-standing problem and Far Eastern (Official) Committee&apos;recommendation has my support.4. The views of the Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand andIndia on the United States proposal are set out in OP. (46) 457 of 13th December,1946.5. The Governments of New Zealand and India both indicated that theywere prepared to support the United States Government if they decided to proceedalong the lines suggested. The New Zealand representative in Washington was authorised to impart his Governments view to the State Department, but afurther telegram, addressed by the New Zealand Government to the Governmentof Canada, indicates that if the United States plan is not acceptable to all theGovernments concerned, the New Zealand Government would be disposed to favour full discussion in the Far Eastern Commission on the lines advocated bythe Government of Australia, to which reference is made in the following paragraph.6. The Governments of Canada and Australia have not yet, as far as isknown, formulated their replies to the United States Government. They are bothimpressed by the political objections to the American plan, the possible reperous-sions on general relations with Russia and on the prestige of the Far eastern commission, and consider that still further attempts should be made to find asolution which would be free from these objections.7.   On the main issue the suggestion put forward by the Australian Govern-nient seems to amount to virtual capitulation to the Russians, since it would leave it open to the Soviet Government to press a claim for a substantial share ofI Japanese internal assets while continuing to maintain that the great volume ofI assets which they have acquired in Manchuria should be treated as war booty andI left outside the reparations pool.   An attempt might be made to persuade theI Soviet Government to accept only a token allocation of internal assets, but itseems most unlikely that such an attempt would meet with any success.8.   The Government of Canada suggest that if a solution cannot be found at a lower level, the Council of Foreign Ministers might be willing to discussthe problem and ask for our views on this.   I would invite my colleagues toconsider whether this suggestion should be pursued.   I am doubtful whether, in13798   [32966]
view of the pressure of other urgent problems, it would be practicable, at leat any time in the near future; and I do not know how far the suggestion wouljcommend itself to the other British Commonwealth Governments concerned.  TieGovernment of New Zealand have made it clear that they doubt whether it i$desirable to refer the matter to the Council of Foreign Ministers.   The Govern.&apos;ment of Australia may be expected to hold similar views, since they are insistentlthat they should participate as principals in all matters affecting the final set&apos;ment with Japan. &apos;9.   Both the Australian and Canadian suggestions seem to be open to objection that they are unlikely to lead to the very early solution of the problem!which is desired by the United States Government.10. If the Cabinet approve the course of action recommended, they may wish that a telegram should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, inthe terms of the draft submitted at Annex B. I would recommend, however,that the Governments of the British Commonwealth countries concerned shouldbe notified, in advance, of the reply which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom propose to return to the United States.11.

The only obstacle to progress is the refusal of the Soviet Government,influenced by their acquisitions in Manchuria, to agree to the inclusion of japanese overseas assets in the reparations pool. The matter has been arguedfor almost a year already, both in the Far Eastern Commission and in bilateralUnited States-Soviet negotiations. All members of the Commission, exceptRussia, ten in all, are agreed that no equitable decision on the division of reparations shares is possible if external assets are left out of account.2. The United States Government have the power to implement policy in IJapan and the issue, in the last analysis, is a political one between the United 1States and Soviet Governments. The United States Government consider that ffurther delay in reaching a decision on reparations would endanger the execution Iof Allied policy in Japan. They regard the matter as so urgent that ^they have put forward the suggestion that they might now take action by means off&quot; interim &quot; directives to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, a right!which the United States Government can invoke &quot; whenever urgent matters arise Inot covered by policies already formulated by the Commission.&quot;3. Details of the procedure contemplated, as indicated orally to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington by General Hilldring, the Assistant Secre-.tary of State, on 6th November, are as follows  The issuance by the United States Government of suitable interim directives!on reparations, determining levels of industry, making allocations of shares and fdirecting removals.   The directives contemplated are : .(a) an initial directive covering 15 or 20 per cent, of the total available jreparations, in order to get reparations deliveries rolling;(b) directives covering the final comprehensive reparations settlement.4. The United States Government would invite all Governments on the Far fEastern Commission to participate in the formulation of the directives. Con-consultations would be conducted with representatives of the participating States,meeting continuously until interim directives had been prepared. It would be the aim of the United States to produce interim directives that had the fullest possible support of the participants.
5. General Hilldrhig stated that if the United States Government decide to proceed on the foregoing basis they would welcome bur participation in the consultations, and he asked for an indication whether we should be willing toparticipate.6. The American suggestions and the issues which they raise have beendiscussed by the Far Eastern (Official) Committee. The Committee consider thatthe balance of advantage lies in supporting the United States proposals, if theUnited States Government finally decide to proceed along the lines indicated.They recommend that the reply to General Hilldring&apos;s approach should be along the lines of the draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washingtonattached at Annex B. They suggest, however, that the Governments of theBritish Commonwealth countries concerned should be informed of the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom before a reply is returnedto the United States Government.7. In making the above recommendations the Far Eastern (Official) Com-mittee had the following considerations in mind.8. The American scheme is open to the objection that it envisages action with regard to the control of Japan without Russian concurrence and, therefore^without the concurrence^ as a body, of the Far Eastern Commission. If thescheme is adopted, and ten countries agree to a course of action opposed by theSoviet Union, there might well be repercussions on general relations with Russiaand the prestige and authority of the Far Eastern Commission might be adversely,affected.9. Further, if the interim directive procedure were to be adopted, theUnited States Government would, in the last analysis; have the final say as totheir content and might make decisions detrimental to the interests of the UnitedKingdom, e.g., decisions unduly favourable to China or the Philippines;10. As against the foregoing, the American proposal appears to afford thebest basis for an immediate, practical solution.11. Over a long period the United States Government have attempted toreach some basis of agreement with Russia, which would not, in its effect, be toounfavourable to other reparations claimants. These efforts have been unsuccessfuland there is little reason to believe that renewed negotiations would produce any more satisfactory result.12. The United States Government are admittedly entitled to determineunilaterally what is so urgent as to justify an interim directive. They wouldappear to be within their right, on a literal interpretation of the terms of reference of the Commission, in taking the action now proposed. It would be open tothem, in any case, to take this action whether other members of the Far eastern commission approved or not.13. The United States Government have expressed the desire for the fullest possible consultations with the other Governments concerned, and the procedure suggested would be a means of ensuring that the will of the majority of tencountries should prevail over that of the one recalcitrant country.14. While recommending acceptance of the American proposal as a basis for the solution of the problem, the Far Eastern (Official) Committee maintainthe view that the matter of first urgency is a decision on the levels of industry for Japan and that decisions on the allocation of reparations shares should notbe allowed to overtake decisions on what is to remain in Japan. A proviso to this effect has accordingly been incorporated in the draft instructions to His Maiesty&apos;ambassador at Washington.ANNEX draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador (Washington)Your telegram No. 6459 [of 6th November : United States suggestions forending Japanese reparations deadlock].General Hilldring&apos;s communication has now been considered by Ministers.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that thematter of first urgency is a decision on the levels of industry in Japan, and. thatthis decision should precede and not follow decisions as to reparations.   They
trust that the United States Government share this view and will agree that thefirst step towards the solution of the reparations deadlock is to press for a very early decision in the Far Eastern Commission on the levels of industry.3. While His Majesty&apos;s Government are in general agreement with theUnited States Government in their desire to solve the reparations problem withoutfurther delay and to break the deadlock created by the Russian refusal to includeJapanese overseas assets in the reparations pool, they consider that the suggestionput forward by General Hilldring, namely, that the United States government might proceed by the issuance of interim directives, would, if it is unacceptable to the Russians, be open to the same political objections as those which induced the United States Government to abandon their earlier proposal that aReparations Committee should be set up outside the Commission.   These are (a) the repercussions on general relations with Russia; and. (b) the effect on the prestige and authority of the Far Eastern Commission,4. If, however, notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, the UnitedStates Government should reach the conclusion that the urgency of the matter,together with the position taken by the Russians, leaves them no option but toproceed along the lines indicated by General Hilldring, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would support them, subject to the reservation regarding levels of industryindicated in paragraph 2 and provided that all British Commonwealth Govern-ments concerned were consulted at all stages both as regards reparations policyand interim deliveries.5. If, therefore, the United States Government decide to adopt the courseoutlined by General Hilldring, His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly accept an invitation to participate in the formulation of interim directives on repara-tions and would be anxious to take part in all consultations held with a view to producing directives having the fullest possible support of all the participatingStates. They note with satisfaction that the intention of the United StatesGovernment would be for representatives of the countries concerned to meetcontinuously until interim directives had been prepared.6. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is essential that removalsshould not overtake decisions as to levels of the industry that is to remain. HisMajesty&apos;s Government therefore recommend that, if a scheme along the lines suggested by General Hilldring is adopted, the procedure and timing should beas follows : (a) every effort should be made to obtain a very early decision on the ParEastern Commission on final levels of industry;(b) concurrently with (a), suitable arrangements should be made to startinterim removals rolling; these not to be in excess of the &apos;&apos; surplus capacity &quot; already agreed by the Far Eastern Commission;(c) the &quot; consulting countries &quot; should decide whether or not Japanese over-seas assets are to be included in the reparations pool;(d) the &quot; consulting countries &quot; should determine the percentage of sharesto be allocated to each claimant country;(e) the final physical division of shares should be made.The decision on final levels of industry in Japan could no doubt be taken at anystage but it is important that it should be taken before the final division of sharesis made.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome an indication of the views ofthe United States Government on this programme.8. Please convey the substance of the foregoing orally to Mr. Byrnes or general Hilldring. .
