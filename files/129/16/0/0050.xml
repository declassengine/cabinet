DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETa, p. (47) 5q - COPY NO._/5th FEBRUARY, 1947CABINET&apos;   IDISLOCATION OF COAL SUPPLIES THROUGH TRANSPORT DIFFICULTIESMemorandum By the Minister of Fuel, and power the recent cold weather and heavy gales, hy dislocatingtransport, have .led to a most serious situation in regard tothe supply of coal.    Briefly, the position is as follows:-(a) This morning, cn the North East Coast, 57 shipsloaded with coal for the&quot;South were held up inports owing to gales.    Other ships which havedischarged their cargoes, of coal in London andthe South were held up this morning by the weatheron their way hack to the loading ports, on theNorth East Coast.(b) In South Wales the handling of coal has, been seriouslyheld up by the freezirig-up of appliances, in the docks, at Cardiff and Barry.(c) The transport of coal by railway is se.serious.lyinterrupted hy heavy snow.    In the Midlands-. and in Northumberland and Durham collierieshave been blocked by snow and work interrupted.Yesterday,  for example.  In Durham,  the largeConsett and Holmside -pits were isolated and inNorthumberland the Throckley pit was closed.Snowfalls have blocked the. Woodheacl Tunnel linkingSheffield and the North Western Region.    In partsof the country it has proved impossible for manyminers to get to their work.    absenteeism on this account is as high as 50 per cent,   at some pits. - .(d) The railways, have placed most stringent embargoes &apos;on the conveyance of all traffic other than coalhut in spite of this, very little coal is being-moved by railway.2.      Immediately the situation was reported to me I took actionin every direction open to me to alleviate the situation whichI consider is now on the mends -(a)    Twenty of the 57 ships held up this morning on theNorth East Coast have sailed south this, afternoon and I hope that the sailing of the remainder will shortly be possible.Sj
-I % %e3 t$END(b) Ships on their way to the Worth East Coast are.again on the move.(c) The railways re-port that when they have askedfor military assistance for -clearing stoppages,at vital points they have received it-,(d) - The Woodhead Tunnel, the blocking of which mighthave been serious, is being cleared by Polishsoldiers,(c)    Stops have been taken to obtain full information regarding the location of collieries, blockedby snow or where miners are unable, on accountof the. snow, to get to work.    When these haveL-cen located it is my intention to seek assistancefrom, the Service Departments with a view,to providing access to the collieries concerned.3.      The Central Electricity Board reported to me this afternoonthat if, owing to weather conditions, coal was not moving fromthe producing areas, it must be expected that by the week endpower stations in London and in South Eastern and North WesternEngland and. the Midlands would, have to close down if no specialaction was taken.    The action which they suggested was:-(1)    that all supplies of electricity should be cutoff from industrial consumers in the four areasindicated above, subject to an exception beingmade in favour of vital services, such as water,sewage, food processing (bakeries,, milk sherill-satiori)  etc(2) that, in the same areas, supplies of - electricityshould, be cut off from domestic consumers. from a. m.   to 1.2 noon and from 2 p. m.  to h p. m.  andthat similar cuts should be applied to theatresand cinemas,.h.      I recognise that the present -position is difficult, butI consider it would be wrong to apply the drastic measuressuggested by the Central Electricity Board until we see whetherthe action new being taken is sufficient to render those, measures-unnecessary.     I myself hope that it may be possible to avoidtaking such measures but I think that wo should keep the questionund.er daily review.. - -E.   S,Ministry of Fuel and Power7 , Mi ilbank , S.
