(47) 239th January, 1947CABINETJAPANESE REPARATIONS  DEADLOCKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of a telegram fromthe New Zealand Government to the Canadian Government regarding the settle-ment of the Japanese reparations question. In this telegram the New zealand government modify to some extent the views expressed in their telegram No. 313of the 7th December to the Dominions Office. (Annex III to CP. (46) 457 of the13th December.)A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W.1,9th January, 1947.annex copy of Telegram dated the 18th September from the New zealand government to the Canadian Government repeated to dominions office as No. 317.Addressed External, Ottawa, No. 42, repeated Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, London, No. 317, External Canberra, No. 230.Your telegram No. 10 of 12th December repeating text your No. 432 toSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs : Japanese Reparations.If United States plan to solve reparations problem by issuance of interimdirectives is not acceptable to all countries represented on F.E.C., we would support full discussion of the matter in the Commission in an attempt to reach an alternative solution acceptable to all. In any case, we prefer this since we arereluctant to see authority of F.E.C. impaired.2. We would be prepared to agree, if necessary, to the Commissionattempting to determine separately and upon broad political lines reparationshares of internal assets, but we would expect that account should be taken atleast inferentiaily of Japanese external assets.3.   In view of the importance of maintaining the authority of F.E.C., we doubt whether it is desirable to refer the problem to the Council of Foreign. Ministers, at least until it is certain that no solution can be found along the fore-going lines.4. If Russia should, nevertheless, insist on an unreasonable claim from internal assets, precluding even tacit allowance being made for her gains in manchuria, alternative measures would have to be considered. We feel that theUnited States proposal would then have a very large measure of justification.5. Meanwhile, we agree that every effort should be made in F.E.C. todetermine the level of industry in Japan, which is a matter of primary urgency.\[32988]
