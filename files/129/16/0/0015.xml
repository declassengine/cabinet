filS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAT!]STY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .SECRETCP. (1+7). .155TH JANUARY s   1947.COPY NO.^CABINETGOAL AND ELECTRICITYMemoi^andum &quot;by the Minister of transport the Minister ef Fuel and Power in his paper (CP. (47)6)asks that an overriding priority be given to the movement ofooal on the railways for the period of one &quot;month to -(i)    Expedite delivery of ooal already in transit ui:1(2)    Ensure that no production of coal is lost through lack of transport,,In paragraph 5 of the Memorandum the Minister3 of fuel and Power states that since the beginning of October over300,000 tons of open cast coal have been put to ground.My information is that &quot;between 9th November and 21st Decemberstocks of  open cast coal on the ground were reduced by35,000 tons,, and that during the period 1st September -7th December,  stocks of coal at the collieries were reducedby over 11+0,000 tons.    The latter figure suggests that someof the Deep mined coal lost through lack of wagons mightbeen stocked at the collieries.have i cannot confirm the increase of 170,000 tons in thepipe line at Christmas but the &quot;bull week&quot; in productionimmediately before would naturally increase the amount in transit especially as movement in December was hampered byfog and frost and by absenteeism during the Christmas period.In paragraph 6 the Minister of Fuel and power statesthat the Departmental estimate of production is 3,.600,000 torn-per week, with the addition ofof open cast coal, a total ofa possible 120,000 tons,720,000 tons per weekper weekTonnage moved per week by rail during the last quarterof 191+6 averaged 2,875,000.    The average weekly tonnage moved by Sea or Sea and Rail, Canal and Road respectively during september, October and November 1946 was 473,000,. 72,000 and346,000 respectively, a total movement including rail of3,766,000 tons per week-    Weather conditions and sickness affectmovement adversely during the winter months, but some benefit should be obtained for coal movements by the cuts made in passenger services.    Availability of coaster tonnage will alsobe increased to the extent of 40 -50,000 tons weekly by thereturn, of shipping from the Baltic which has already begun,,
Coal already enjoys a very substantial priority on railboth in the supply of wagons, and in the exemption which itnormally enjoys from the embargoes placed on other trafficswhen movement is congested.Every possible step is being taken to relieve thelocomotive shortage which is at the root of urtost presentrailway difficulties.    Guts in passenger services, main lineas well as local,  have been made and have released some 75locomotives for freight working.    Some further small cuts canbe made but anything &quot;beyond that would involve dislocation of services and hardship    tc passengers.    I. have instructed theRailway Companies that they are to run no special passengertrains for sport or other non-essential purposes- where doing so would absorb- locomotives or rail capacity which could beused for moving coal or essential freight.The maximum contribution is being made by other formsof transport.    Arrangements have been made to supply the road transport required in the Midlands, and coastwise tonnage is available for all the coal which can be handled by that means.I cannot,  however, guarantee that the railways will he able to speed up movement of coal and lift the whole output, unless they are relieved of some other traffic.    if coal is to have priority, other classes of traffic must suffer.    In the normal course the impact of such a priority would be upon the heavyfreight: traffic - building materials,  iron ore, iron and steel products, fertilisers and so on.    I should need the guidanceof my colleagues as to the classes of traffic and industryupon which any shortage of transport is to fall.The Minister of Fuel and Power has suggested thatarrangements on the lines of those made in preparation forD Day should be applied to coal traffic during the next month.The two problems are of  course fundamentally different.    ForD Day the problem was the carrying out of a series of closelyplanned movements,  especially to certain, ports of embarkation,and special reductions of other classes of traffic particularlyiron and steel, were planned and put into operation in advance,so that at the beginning of the operation the transport system ,was clear - and incidentally it was midsummer and not midwinter.In the case of coal, destinations are ubiquitous while coaitrains necessarily move at lower speeds than other trains.Literal priority, therefore, would I. fear produce a chaoticstate of affairs&apos;on the railways.    Nevertheless I. am preparedto consider with the Minister of Fuel and Power what further measures of a practical nature can be devised.(irrtld)    A.B.Ministry of Transport,.Berkeley Square, W.1.5TH JANUARY,   1947.
