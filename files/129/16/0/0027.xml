(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE .PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETq.P. (4.7) 2711TH J^dNUARY,  1947/ CMJOPY NO.CABINETJAPANEgJ REP^vRjxTIONS DEADLOCKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs- in connection with CP,   (46)457 and CP. (47)23,I circulate for the information of my colleagues copiesof two further telegrams from the Government of Australiaregarding the settlement of the Japanese reparations question.It will bo seen that the Australian Government havenow modified their original proposal in such a way as tomeet the objections to that proposal which aresummarized In paragraph 7 of the memorandum by thssSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the4th January (CP. (47)9).      They still are insistent,however, that, before having resort to the United states proposal for proceeding by.means of interim directives,It should be. made clear by pressing the issue to a vote in the Far Eastern Commission that the existing deadlockcannot be resolved in that Commission.The position,  therefore,  is that the Governmentsof Canada, Australia and New Zealand do not favour resort to the United. States plan until it is clear that the deadlock cannot be solved in any other way,.A.Dominions Offi*e, S.W.1.i1TH JANUARY,  1947*
ANNEX ICOPY OF TELEGRAM NO.  9 OF THE 10TIi JANUARY- FROM THEAUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO .THS DOMINIONSvQPFICEAddressed Secretary of State for Dominion. Affiars*Uo,  9p repeated Australian Embassy  (Washington) No. 37Wellington No.  h Ottawa No.  1.Your No. 392.      Reparations from Japan.The Australian representative on F.E.C. was advised that the State Department intended to approach the secret d&apos;azof State early this week with . proposal that UnitedStates should proceed immediately with their plan forthe formulation of interim directives.      He was thereforeauthorised to present an aide memoire to the state department on Monday morning to the effect that theAustralian Government is unable to agree at this stage to United States proposals,  hopes that alternativemeasures can be devised which will not bypass thejurisdiction of F.E.C., and intends to give more detailedanswer to United States proposals at an early date.We have now sent instructions to Australian Embassy(Washington)  as set out in our immediately- following-telegram.Although United States proposal may not contravenethe literal interpretation of F.E.C.  terms of reference,it is considered to bo unsound to assume that further progress cannot be made in F.E.C..      The issue shouldbe tested by vote.      We feel that full weight must begiven to your conclusion that the- Soviet would not agreeto accept a token share of internal assets,  but considerit unwise to bypass F.E.C.  on that assumption.      if your conclusion were substantiated by the result of a vote taken in F.E.C. we would be prepared to cooperatewith the United States of America in the preparationof interim directives, subject to satisfactory agreement being reached which would safeguard the position of the-majority of the countries concerned and subject todetermination of levels of industry by F.E.C.With reference to Canada&apos;s telegram No. h32     paragrahh, we feel that to refer the problem to the Councilof Foreign Ministers at this stage would be most detrimentsto the prestige of F.E.C.  and to the principles of armistice revision for which Australia has consistentlystood and would in any case involve such delay that united States of America would not agree.

See my immediately preceding telegramaddressed to Dominions Office.As indicated previously, we are opposed to any actionwhich will tend to evade  the jurisdiction of the F.S.C.    r:ewould be reluctant to accept the United States proposal unless it were clear that the deadlock on external assets could notbe resolved in F.E.C.      We could not agree that such a situation existed unless the matter had been tested by vote in the Commission.The State Department should be advised that australia would be willing to co-operate with  the United StatesGovernment in the preparation of interim directives.Australia, however, requests(a) that the Soviet attitude on external assets be-clearly established by pressing the issue to a vote in F.E.C. ,(b) that F.E.C.  determine  the levels of industry for japan before detailed decisions on reparationsallocations are made,(c) that a majority of F.E.C.  member countries should agree to participate in the United States plan,(d) that the United States Government should agree  toa procedure for the consequent discussions wherebydecisions reached by a substantial majority ofparticipating members will be given effect to.
