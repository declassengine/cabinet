(47) 113rd January, 1947CABINETCopy No. 29MIDDLE EAST OILMemorandum submitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister for Fuel and PowerWE submit for the information of our colleagues a. factual memorandum onthe present and future trend of oil production in the Middle East. It showsclearly the vital importance for Great Britain and the British Empire of the oil resources of this area.Foreign Office,3rd January, 1947.E. B.E. S.Memorandum on Middle East Oil1. The purpose of this memorandum is to draw attention to four features of the Middle East oil industry so that their political aspect may be considered.The four features are ; (A) The growing importance of the Middle East to world oil economy.(B) The spectacular rise in crude oil production in the Middle East antici-pated over the years 1945-50-55.(C) The extent of British interest in Middle East oil (on a shareholdingbasis), and the magnitude of our investment therein.(D) The dependence of the British Commonwealth on Middle East oil inpeace conditions and in war.2.   To illustrate 1 (A) above, diagrams A and B are attached.(a) Diagram A forecasts two significant trends : (i) Middle East area is expected to provide a greater proportionof the total world increase of production than any other oil-bearing region.(ii) United States production is likely to fall steadily, failing discoveryof major new oil-fields.On the basis of (ii) above the United States, whose production at present somewhatexceeds consumption, will shortly become importers of oil on a growing scale,drawing their supplies in the main from the Caribbean (see paragraph 5 (ii)).(b) Diagram B shows the long-term importance of the Middle East asa reservoir of oil in relation to world reserves. Oil reserves cannotbe estimated without a wide margin of error. Nevertheless it is evident that a high proportion of the known, and of the speculativefuture, oil reserves of the world occur in the Middle East.13793   [32967]
23. The rate at which crude oil production is likely to develop in the middle east area (see 1 (B) above) is illustrated by Diagram C. The significant pointsare : (a) Total production may be quadrupled in period 1945-50-55.(6) The centre of gravity shifts from Persia to the Arab lands by 1950.(c) Kuwait emerges by 1950 as a producer comparable to Iraq and SaudiArabia.An incidental effect of this increased production will be the swollen royaltiesreceived by Middle East Governments, see Diagram D.4. The extent of British interest in Middle East oil production on a shareholding basis (see 1 (C) above) is shown in Diagram E. The dominant Britishrole and the increasing United States share are plainly shown.No estimate of the total value of the British share in the Middle East oil industry can be expressed in terms of pounds sterling without considerabledifficult research. The value to this country of the sales of oil products, of tanketearnings and of the industrial orders, &amp;c, &amp;c, represent an immense sum. Thefollowing facts may give a clue to its extent: -(i) At current oil prices the approximate sales returns on the products from the British-controlled share of Middle East crude oil wouldbe:-Year.

Tentative- estimates of British Commonwealth (exclusive&apos; of Canada andIndia) requirements 1945-50-55 in peace are shown at Diagram F. In relationto these figures the following points must be considered:  (1) The output of oil from British Empire sources (excluding Canada) is noiabout 3 million tons. It is unliikely to rise to more than 5 million tonsa year in the future.(2) The Middle East is at present supplying about 25 million tons or about60* per cent, of the oil required for British use.(3) British requirements in peace conditions will probably be some 18 millioitons larger in 1955 than now. Only two producing areas are ca-pabliof developing exports on this scale the Caribbean area (comprisingVenezuela and other Latin American countries)&apos; and the Middle EastBut the United States is likely to; absorb most of the increase inCaribbean prodimetion, so that the expansion in British needs will tend to be drawn in the main from the Middle East. The proportionof British oil! supplies derived from Middle- East sources ma)therefore rise to about 70 per cent, in 1955&apos;. The importance of tkaccessible and prolific Middle East oilfields would be accentualin war.
