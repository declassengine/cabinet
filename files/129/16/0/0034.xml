(h7) 3h ^23th January,  19h7*9* orjy No....11CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS GREECE AND TURKEYMemorandum by the Secretary -&amp;f- State for Foreign affairs as the Cabinet will be aware,  the question of Britishtroops in Greece has been under review for some time,  andalso the state of the Greek Army.      We accepted responsibilityfor giving guidance for the training and development of theGreek Army in order that they might be able to defend themselves against any attack from their neighbours.      The Chiefs ofStaff, who have examined this problem,  recommend that theGreek Army shall be Increased and, in view of the difficultieswhich the Greeks are experiencing with the bandit war, that thetraining shall be changed,,      Therefore I recommend that wesupport the increase of the Greek Army as recommended by theChiefs of Staff;    that the financial liability shall be dealtwith as explained hereafter,  and that the British forces shallbe reduced by 1st April,  19h7,  to one brigade of fourbattalions and that this brigade would remain in Greece untilthe date of the withdrawal of Russian forces from Bulgaria^i.e.  90 days after the ratification of the Bulgarian Treaty.2S In the event of the Commission appointed by theUnited Nations not disposing of the trouble on the Greekfrontiers it will be necessary for the Greek Array to he trainedso as to deal with this bandit warfare.      To achieve this theywill need additional British equipment and I propose that theyshould be supplied with this providing the Greek Government  -will meet this additional cost up to the 31st March,approximately  2,000,000,  and that I should be authorised toinform the Greek Government at an early date.3a With regard to the long term financial position,,the United States have indicated that they are interested,I propose that I should be authorised to take up with them the question of the cost of the Greek Armed Forces after the31st March (when our present commitment ends) with a view tosharing it.ho There is no doubt that the presence of our forces in greece has been a decisive factor in maintaining order in alarge part of that country and has deterred Greecefs northernneighbours from direct aggression and has made it possible tomaintain Greek morale in the face of external threats and &apos;internal disturbances.
9 % 95o I would call attention to the fact that a greatsource of danger to Greece are the foreign-backed Communistand !lPree Macedonian&quot; bands there and unless the GreekGovernment is placed in a position to deal with these,  therewill be no political stability or substantial progress in economic reconstruction and the reparation of war damage.6. I do not think,  however, that wo should underestimatethe amount of recovery that Greece has already made in spiteof the difficulties.      These problems have been so featuredin the press of the world that her achievements have &quot;beenforgotten.      Having undertaken to try and put Greece on a stable basis we must,  I suggest, now see it through.. &apos;   the difficult time will come next spring.7. American economic and financial experts have justarrived in G-reece to explore the position and report to theUnited States Government.      It will be essential to know fromthe United States Government,  apart from the military situation,what their precise proposals are and the extent of thefinancial,  economic and military help they are prepared to giveover a period of three years.8. The next difficulty is that of Turkey.      We have onalliance with that country,  and the United States has in herdiscussions with us indicated that she was ready to assist inthat area as well.      The Turkish Army has to be reorganised andeauipped and an appropriate contribution to the manpower for-essential.....defence.........sh.o.ul,d.,;ba.,mpri2V,ld.aoU      Here too,  the UnitedStates Government should be asked to undertake as large a shareof expenditure as possible.      I also recommend that we should consist-operate in advising the Turkish Government on the training and organisation of their armed forces,  that British ServiceRepresentation in Turkey should be strengthened for&apos; thispurpose and that meanwhile the present limited supply of equipment should be continued.      Additional equipment which theTurkish Army may need should be provided as a result of thediscussions with which we are now asking authorisation toproceed.E.3.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.25th January,&apos; 19h7*
