(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC. MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (U7) 104 TH JANUARY,   19U7CABINETEAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUT PROJECTMemorandum by the Minister of food the attached paper asks for authorisation to proceedwith the main part of the East African groundnut project-2. My colleagues will see that this is a &quot;big enterprise;it has to be if it is to meet even a substantial part of ourdesperate need for fats.      My colleagues would not believe meif I tried to pretend to them that such a scheme was free fromrisk.      Of course,  serious difficulties and delays, many ofthem unforeseeable, may arise in the course of a great under-taking of this sort..3. But what I would ask rny colleagues to consider arethe risks of not undertaking this project.      If we do not make-a determined effort such as this-to open up a new supply of oils and fats, we shall risk two things..      First:    in 1950we may have the same,  or a lower, margarine ration than to-day.      Or second:    in 1950 we may have to spend so manydollars on buying fats from dollar sources that we shall havetoo few left to buy other indispensable dollar imports.ii. Again a large enterprise of this type is the only way in which our Central African possessions can be rapidlydeveloped,  so that they may become an economic and strategicasset instead of a liability,  as to a large extent they noware.5* It may be objected that public.money should not beused in an enterprise of this kind.      But shall we not have failed as a Government unless we can, on suitable occasions,substitute public,  socialist enterprise for private enterprise?The alternative would be to turn the whole thing over toUnilevers with a blank cheque to do what they liked.      Thereare a dozen reasons why the Colonial Secretary,  and indeed all my colleagues, would not allow us to do that.      But if we are quite unwilling to use private enterprise for such purposes asthose, must we not face up to using public  enterprise?Otherwise we shall use neither kind of enterprise, and weshall fail as a Government because of a stalemate betweenthe two systems.6. The finance of the scheme is set    out in paragraph 3of the attached paper.      The salient figures to keep in mindare theses-COPY NO.
(i).  The maximum investment of public money which willhe &quot;at risk&quot; at any given moment (31st August, 1950)  isestimated at  25^- million.(ii)    The profits which will be made during the 25years to the 31st August, 1971 are estimated at just on 17 million.(iii)    In addition,  the United Kingdom and East african governments should, during this period,  have derived  21-g-million from the scheme in taxation.(iv)    All these figures are based on an estimated costof production of groundnuts of rather under  18 f.o*b. perton,  and on a selling price of  30 per ton in the first fouryears and  20 per ton thereafter.      We are about to paybetween  1+0 to  50 per ton for a comparable product fromWest Africa and are paying something like  70 or  80 per tonin dollars for comparable products outside the Empire  (i.e.   theArgentine).Ministry of Pood, S.W.  1.,4th January, 1947.
