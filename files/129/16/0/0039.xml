HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s GOVERNMENT)setting ORE TCP. (47) 39.27TH JANUARY,  19h7CABINETTHE WOMEN&apos;S LAND army memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries1.      The Cabinet  (c.M.(,h7) 9th. Meeting) invited the Secretaryof State for Scotland and myself to review the organisationand conditions of service in the Women&apos;s Land Army.    in discussion,  the suggestion was made that more women could be absorbed into agriculture, if the organisation of the W.L.A.were overhauled and its conditions of service made more attractive.    The matter must be considered also in relationto the proposal that women should undertake a two years&apos;period of service in work of national importance.Organisation of W.L.A.2.      In England the W.L.A.  organisation consists of aHeadquarters, which is in effect part of the Ministry&apos;s ManPower Division; unpaid&apos;County Committees, with paidsecretarial, organising and clerical staffs; and a widespreadsystem of voluntary helpers - there are still over 2,000of them - on -welfare matters.    This organisation was responsible for the remarkable success achieved during thewar, when the Land Army reached a membership of over 80,000.It is not clear what are the criticisms now made of it.3*     I have no doubt that the reduction in membership is duenot to - organisational deficiencies but to other factors.The Land Army was set up to meet a special and peculiarlydifficult wartime need.    Both the women who went into it -in the main - and the farmers using it have looked upon itas an emergency measure.    Most of the members joined as their form of war service.    Some 200,000 women have passed through the Land Army during the last seven years; but only,000 of those eligible for release at the end of the warwith Germany definitely signed on for a further year, and about one-half of the present membership of about 30,000consists of women with one year&apos;s  service or less.    Mostfarmers would much rather have male labour; and where theycan employ women, they prefer local women with an agricultural background.    No organisational changes willCOPY NO. i
Improvements &apos; in Conditions4.     The main items for consideration as regards conditionsof service are these-Wages and Hours - Minimum wages are, of course, those fixed for women by the Agricultural Wages Board.    There must obviously be a reasonable relativity, between the wages and hours of W.L.A. members and those of other women (and men)regular agricultural workers.    Higher pay for the W.L.A.would almost certainly have to be met by the State itself;and it would encourage demands for higher wages throughoutagriculture.Clothing - The land girl gets her working kit provided free(and free of coupons) by the Government, and it is replaceableas required.    This kit is equivalent to about 150 coupons.The land girl may also obtain 20-35 coupons on release fromthe Land Army on proof of need.    Possible improvements arethe provision of a walking-out dress and an increased couponbonus on leaving the Land Army.    These would be attractions,but they would further increase the disparity between theland girl and the ordinary worker;  and it would take a good many months before a walking-out dress could be issued.One small but useful concession would be to allow womenleaving the Land Army to keep their kit, free of charge,  ifthey intend staying on the land.Travel - Pour free railway vouchers are allowed per annum,to any station chosen by the member.    Concessions on travelare readily justified by reason of the liability of the landgirl to be moved to any part of the country;  but it is very doubtful whether any further grant is justified.    There isno appreciable complaint within the Land Army about theexisting fs.cilities.Hogtel c conditions ti ons , lintert a inme nt s , etc.  - As much is done assupplies and facilities allow under this he siding.    It ishoped that improvements in hostel amenities can be made,but with present shortages nothing&apos; spectacular can be offered.5.      In general, it has to be borne in mind that the W.L.A.forms part - and a small part - of the total agricultural labour force.     (The regular labour force now includes14,94,000 mien and 59,000 women outside the W.L.A.  as against30,000 women in the W.L.A.    Preferential conditions for w.L.A. members,  except where specially justified (e.g. railwayvouchers for those away from home) would lead to resentmentamong other agricultural workers which, would outweigh the satisfaction among W.L.A. members.    It was for that sort of reason that war&apos;gratuities were refused them.G e he r a 1 C o ns i de r a t i o ns6.      Although special steps will be required for the nextyear 01-&apos; two, a distinction must be made now betweenemergency measures and long-term measures to maintain theagricultural labour force.    Any large expansion of the W.L.A.(whether through the present organisation or any other)would probably have to be mainly in the direction of
employment by County Agricultural Executive Committees.Already Committees will clearly have to play the main partin the resettlement of those Poles who come into agriculture.There Is a limit to the numbers that Committees can suitablyemploy;  and the Workers&apos; Unions are strongly opposed to thecasualisation of agricultural labour through the widespreaduse of Committee gangs.7.      The net cost of the W.L.A.  in 19u7 was about  850,000,including uniforms,  hostel costs, and administrative expenses amounting to over  250,000.    The transfer ofadministration to County Agricultural Executive committees would not reduce the cost appreciably if at all; and the replacement of the voluntary we Ifare workers by a paid staff -if suitable people could be found - would add&apos; to itc o n s iderably.8.     Prom the standpoint of a stable and efficient agricultureit is undesirable that farmers should rely too much upon the direct provision of labour by the Government.    They must be encouraged to think in terms of regular labour, and of helpingthemselves to recruit it by the normal means.    Any assistance the Government can give to that end - especially by theprovision of houses - will be of the utmost value.Future of the W.L.A.9.      With these points in mind,  I had, in fact, beenreviewing the position of the Land Army during the last fewmonths.    At a Conference I attended last October, it wasmade clear that the organisation Itself, as represented by its County Chairmen and Secretaries, does not feel that itcan be held together much longer and is anxious that its position should be defined.    The conclusions I reached wasthat it would not be desirable,  even if it were practicable,to try to maintain the W.L.A.  indefinitely, but that in viewof the prospective labour difficulties of the next year ortwo we should endeavour to keep it in being until the autumn of 19h8.    If,  however, numbers could not be kept up to20,000, it should be wound up earlier.&apos;  I had accordinglyarranged to begin a new recruiting campaign very soon, andto urge present members to stay on, with the inducement ofa week&apos;s State-paid holiday.    I proposed to announce these plans to the House of Commons at once and to explain themto the Land Army.10.    It should be added that the winding-up of the Land army would not prevent the continued employment of those members who were prepared to stay on in agriculture.    A good manyfarmers will wish to retain women already in their employment;and Committees will be able to take any others wanting to stay on.national Service11.    These plans need not be altered, in my view, even ifnational service for women were adopted.    Women opting for agriculture Would be able to take employment with county agricultural Executive Committees or with farmers, wherefarmers were ready to accept them.    After the Land Army comes to an end,  special arrangements would no doubt have to bemade for some elementary training,  and also for the issue ofsome working kit, but that might be  done through the Committee
12.    It is well to recognise, however,  that the wastage,through unsuitability and for other reasons, from amongwomen called up is likely to be very heavy,  especially ifthe elaborate welfare arrangements of the present organisationcome to an end,  and also that the provision of training and working kit to women called, up, but not to those going intoagriculture through the normal channels, will createdifficult problems.Summary13.    My r e c omme nd a t i ons ar e : -(i)    That whether or not the Cabinet decide in favourof national service for women,  the W.L.A.  shouldnot be continued beyond October 1948&apos;,  and should come to an end sooner if luimbers cannot be kept up to a suitable level;(ii) That in the meantime:(a) We should try to keep numbers up, mainlythrough recruiting publicityj(b) There should be no matericil change in theorganisation or the conditions of service.When the Land Army comes to an end, employment for women in agriculture will still be available through individualfairmers and County Agricultural Executive Committees.14-.    The Secretary of State for Scotland is in agreementwith these recommendations in principle.(intd.)     T.W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.27TH JANUARY,  1947-
