(47) 19). I com-mend both of them to the care fid study of my colleagues; they deserve and requirethe most thorough consideration.It is, of course, of the utmost importance that steps should be taken to avoiddisclosure of the proposals discussed in the Report.H.

TOP SECRET[M.E.P. (46) 1621st December, 1946]cabinet ministerial Committee on Economic PlanningECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1947COVERING MEMORANDUM BY THE STEERING COMMITTEEI. introductory. The outstanding point thrown up by the Survey is the great and increasing gap between resources and requirements. We are trying to do too many things. There is a general shortage of labour for the work to be done. Inthis respect the situation is getting worse rather than better, and the shortageis likely to last for some years. We have to make sure that we use all the productive resources&apos; of the country to the utmost; we have to see that they are used in the best way; that we do not start more projects than can be completed within a reasonable period; and this means that we have to scrutinise the require-ments and see which of them are to be curtailed or postponed.For the next two or three years our major problems are the balance ofpayments and the inflationary risks of the general excess of demand over supply.If&apos;either of these is neglected, the whole of our planning faces a complete breakdown.Balance of Payments2. Much of our food and practically all of our raw materials must comefrom abroad. Owing to the loss of our overseas income we can only pay for thoseimports by exports, practically all manufactured goods. Exports must thus havea high claim on national production, in competition with production for industrial equipment at home and consumption goods at home.3. Our total balance of payments is rather better than was expected whenthe last Economic Survey was made. The deficit in 1946 is only  475 million as compared with the original estimate of  750 million. The deficit for 1947is now estimated to be about  200^250 million, though this deficit will be largerif any part of the general deficit revealed by the Survey is allowed to fall on exports. This apparent improvement conceals the gravity of our dollar situation.Owing to our present dependence upon the American continent for supplies, andthe rising prices in the United States, our dollar reserves are being exhaustedlong before we have been able to establish any appreciable dollar income. this situation is discussed in greater detail in M.E.P. (46) 10.4. At the end of this year, under the conditions of the American Loan,we must conduct our trade on a non-discriminatory basis; we cannot buy forsoft currencies if there is a better price offering in hard currencies. InJuly 1947 we have to accept the convertibility of all net sterling earned by our suppliers into dollars, and also of an agreed proportion of the accumulatedsterling balances.f32881] B
5. The increasing anxiety about our dollar position means that we mustrule out any deliberate policy of reducing exports in order to give relief toshortages at home. To increase exports and also to relieve shortages at homeis impossible without an over-all increase in production.6. We must make sure that we receive payment for our exports, preferably in supplies, but otherwise in gold or convertible currencies. To do this wemust seek to influence the destination of important exports, without, however,imposing any additional restrictions on exports, or damaging long-term prospects.7. The Cabinet on 4tJh November (CM. (46) 94th Conclusions) set a target for the second half of 1947 of a volume of exports 50 per cent, greater than in1938. This will be hard to achieve but we dare not set any lower target. In termsof planning it means that we must make a prior charge of about 20 per cent, ofour industrial production in order to secure the income on which we depend forour food and for the raw materials necessary for employment. This must beaccepted as a fact and a condition of our planning at home.General Inflationary Situation8. The general excess of demand over supply or, in other words, the factthat we are trying to do more than can be done with the present resources of thecountry shows itself most plainly in the shortage of manpower to meet require-ments. The manpower gap shown in the Survey at the end of 1947 is 630,000,as compared with a gap of only 245,000 at December, 1946, as estimated in theEconomic Survey for 1946-47, and within this general shortage there are incertain key industries special shortages which have a paralysing effect on thewhole of the rest of the economy.9. But even this figure of 630,000 understates the true potential gap. Itis based on limited estimates of departmental requirements which have beenscaled down to take account of the realities of the situation, and, as regards therequirements of personal consumption, it is far from representing the full measureof the effective demand on manpower as it would be if unrestrained by controlsand planning.10. This estimate of consumption is the lower of two alternative levels of personal consumption discussed in the Survey Assumptions A and B inparagraph 18 of the Survey. On assumption A, which postulates that theproportion of private incomes saved is the same as in 1938, the demands madeon the national resources would exceed the total available national product by 648 million, or 1\ per cent. This is too large a gap to be left unadjusted andallowed to close itself automatically. If this were done, many of the cuts whichmust inevitably occur would fall on essential supplies and key commodities, theabsence of which impedes production. The Survey therefore proposes that weshould aim at getting as near as possible to the level of consumption adopted inassumption B, and we accept this as a reasonable objective for planning.11. In terms of personal incomes and savings, this target means that 12 percent, of private income, after tax, has to be saved, as compared with the pre-warfigure of 7-3 per cent. And this is not the end of the story. There is a bigback-log of accumulated demand from the war years and there are largeaccumulated savings to cover it. It is quite probable that, if demand were leftquite unrestrained and if supplies were available to meet it, the rate of netprivate saving, so far from being at the pre-war level, would fall to zero -if,indeed, some net dissaving did not actually occur. From this two things stand outclearly. First, strong measures will have to be taken if we are to cut our coatto fit our cloth and bring about the inevitable reductions of demand in an orderlyway so that the cuts come where they can best be afforded in the national interest.Secondly, there must be no let-up of the National Savings Campaign: it mustif anything, be intensified.12. We have considered what measures we could advise Ministers to adoptwhich would produce an early and substantial reduction in this generalinflationary pressure. The traditional correctives would include a sharp rise inthe rate of interest and substantial increases in taxation. For various reasonsthis medicine must be ruled out in the present situation. After the war years ofausterity such a policy would be difficult to defend and would certainly have a depressing effect on incentive. To increase the rate of interest at a time whenlarge expenditure on investment is vitally necessary for the economic recovery ofthe country might hamper our subsequent competitive efficiency, apart from its
possible consequences on some aspects of social policy. To attempt to operatethrough an increase of taxation on current incomes ignores the over-hang of the enormous amount of accumulated savings.13. We must firmly avoid any measures which have the risk of increasingthe pressure of demand on supply. But in present circumstances we do not see any practical solution of the problem by a global financial policy of the kindmentioned. On the contrary we think that our situation requires measures under two heads: (a), and by far the more urgent, measures to increase total production; (b) refraining from trying to do too many things at once and takingmeasures to curtail specific demands by devoting our resources to the things whichare of the most urgent importance in the national interest.II. Manpower14. Under (a), we must survey all the possible sources of extra manpowerfor civilian production, and the situation is so grave that we cannot neglect to lay before Ministers any possible recommendations for alleviating the situation.A rmed Forces and Supplies15. We wish, first, to draw attention to the claims of defence. The require-ments of the Armed Forces are put at 1,385,000 at the beginning of 1947 and1,200,000 at the end of 1947. The latter figure is that which it was first intendedto reach by the end of 1946. Together with leave-takers, the average manpowertaken by the Armed Forces during 1947 will be 1 -4 million. The requirement for labour employed directly upon home-produced supplies and equipment for the armed Forces stands at about 530,000 throughout 1947. But, as explained in, paragraph 16 of the Survey, this seriously understates the total manpowerrequired for defence. &apos; The total claim on British manpower is, in fact, of theorder of 2-6 million men and women, which is more than one-eighth of the totalworking population. We are not competent to attempt to balance military andeconomic needs, but from the economic point of view we feel bound to questionwhether the country can aiford to devote so big a proportion of its manpower to defence at the present time. We should point out, moreover, that the war potential itself may be affected if the economy continues to be overstrained by military demands in excess of its capacity. We suggest as a target for considera-. tion that the direct requirements of manpower for the Armed Forces and their supply industries, now put at 1 - 7 millions for the end of 1947, should be reducedby not less than 300,000.Other Government Activity16. We also draw attention to the estimate of 670,000 for the non-industrial civil Service at the end of 1947. The present figure is 710,000, and this includes300,000 women, compared with 100,000 women in 1939. A Committee of Ministershas already been established to consider Civil Service numbers. We make no recommendation about this pending consideration by the Ministerial Committee;but it is for consideration whether, from the point of view of the national economy as a whole, a labour force of this size, to which must be added 800,000 in local Government, is not more than we can afford for public administration. any reduction of the number will, of course, affect Government policy or the speed atwhich effect can be given to Government policy, but it may be necessary to considerwhether some developments may not have to be postponed, however desirable theymay be, if we are to avoid using an undue proportion of the nation&apos;s manpoweron administration.Foreign Labour1.7. We are faced with an acute shortage of labour for our plans. Thisshortage is likely to continue. For very many years anything like large-scaleimmigration of foreign labour, either for temporary purposes or for settlement in this country, has not been part of our policy, though it has been the policy ofother countries whose populations have been insufficient to work up their resources. Thus, in the Plan which M. Monnet has prepared for the industrial reconstruction of France the immigration and settlement of several hundred thousand foreign workers is contemplated, and it is understood that the FrenchTrade Unions have accepted the policy.18.   Although it is evident that work-people of good types are available inother countries, and would no doubt like to come nere, public opinion wouldhesitate to accept a policy which means such a break with the past.   But events[32881] &apos; B 2
have put at our disposal a considerable number of foreign workers, of whom,however, many are only temporarily available. We are employing in agricultureat present 1,130,000 men; of these 80,000 are Prisoners of War belonging to theagricultural &quot;standing labour force.&quot; The Prisoners of War are being-repatriated at present at the rate of 6,000 a month, and it seems possible that this rate may have to be increased. The prospect is, therefore, that by the end of1947 the present labour force in agriculture will have been depleted by 70,000-80,000.19. We shall also, within a matter of months, have about 150,000 Polishsoldiers in this country. Although there are plans for the emigration of some ofthem to other countries, particularly Latin America, this will be a slow process,and it is certain that a large number of these Polish soldiers will be with us fora long time. If we do not employ them, they are a liability we have to keep them and they do nothing for their own keep. If we do employ them they arean asset which is doubly valuable, for they relieve the total shortage, and theycan be more easily steered into some of the industries where the shortage is mostacute and difficulties of recruitment are sharpest.Employment of Women20. The above measures will still leave a substantial gap in our manpowerbudget and we come now to two more drastic measures. We recognise that thedecisions involved are not only difficult in themselves but raise serious political issues. Nevertheless we think the situation is such that it is our duty to put.them forward for consideration. While the coalmining, steel and building-materials industries require men, the bulk of the general labour shortage is ashortage of women. This is particularly the ease in the textile industries, whichare all very short of women; in cotton spinning, on which other sections of the textile and clothing industries largely depend, the shortage is specially acute. Itis extremely important to build up the labour force in these industries quickly,both from the point of view of the home consumer and of the export trade.In view of the very serious shortage of women, we put forward for consideration that for a limited period of, say, two years women aged 20 should be called upfor national service in the same way as young men aged 18 are to be called up.Women would be given the choice between the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Forces, theWomen&apos;s Land Army (which needs reinforcing), nursing and hospital domestic service (where the shortage is acute); at the same time those industries in whichthere is a specially acute shortage of women (the chief of which would be the textile industries) would be scheduled as reserved industries. in which women would be exempt from the call-up. Apart from helping the services mentionedabove, the main effect would be the voluntary transference of women from thenon-reserved industries to the reserved industries in order to avoid being called up. We think this would have a greater effect in helping the industries whichare short of women than the direct effect of compulsory direction into them; itwouldi also avoid direct industrial conscription. As we have said, we realise that this proposal has serious political implications and could only be put intooperation if the country were persuaded that a state of emergency exists. It is because we think the situation is critical that we put forward this proposal, whichwould, we think, be the biggest single thing which can be done quickly to relieve the acute shortage of labour in the textile industries.School-Leaving Age21. The second matter to which we wish to draw attention, though we recognise that the political implications may be even more difficult, is the raising of the school-leaving age. This commitment, coming at a time when the wholeeconomy is badly overstrained, amounts to a serious diminution of the net pro-ductive resources of the country. It means a direct loss to the national labour force which will reach 370,000 by September 1948. Now that conscription isbeing continued, the 18 age-group will not be available for work in industry,and the raising of the school-leaving age is a further deprivation of the juvenilelabour force. It involves also a further depletion of manpower resources, since12,000 additional teachers have to be trained. And it means an extra demandfor the building of schools at a time when the building resources are alreadyinsufficient to meet the demands of repair of war damage, housing, building of factories and Government offices (for instance, those required for the national insurance Scheme) as well as other forms of reconstruction.
22. Coming by itself, the raising of the school-leaving age would not placeany intolerable strain on the country&apos;s resources, but, in combination with thecontinuance of conscription and coming at a time when the manpower difficulties are so great as they are now, it does represent a significant extra burden. while we do not suggest that Ministers should go back on the settled policy which hasbeen put before the country, we feel bound to draw their attention to the matter,if only to point out that it may not in fact prove possible to make the necessaryresources available to give complete effect to the decision all over the country atthe date announced. We suggest, in view of the situation in which we find ourselves, that if it should happen that in some places the necessary accommoda-tion cannot be provided out of the available building resources without givingsuch exceptional priority as would be seriously detrimental to other importantrequirements, some measure of postponement in this respect should be accepted.Apart from this, the pressure on building resources is so great that it will onlybe possible to meet imperative educational needs over the next two years.III. Basic Supplies23. We turn now to the other side of the balance sheet and consider thedemands to be made on the resources. But before considering any global plan forthe utilisation of total resources, we have thought it essential to examine theposition in those basic commodities in which there are special shortages, since these have widespread repercussions throughout the economy and are in facta limiting factor on our total effective resources. It is no good making plans in terms of the total economy unless we know how these special shortages will affect it. We have taken for this special examination coal, power, steel and building materials. Our object has been to find out exactly what the suppliesof these materials will be and what production programmes they will allow.For instance, how big can the housing programme and the factory-building pro-gramme be with the available supplies of bricks, timber and steel ? If we candetermine this, it will fix the size of the building labour force to which we should work and, at the same time, it will go a long way to determine the size of the investment programme. It is only by approaching the matter in this way thatwe can get a central view of the supply allocations and the programmes of thedifferent industries from the point of view of production. Unless we do this,there is nothing to prevent industries from recruiting labour on hopeful assump-tions about the supplies of materials they will get, and if these supplies are not forthcoming, the result is that men are kept hanging about on the job, output perman falls, and there is a waste of labour which could better be employed elsewhere.It is essential to get realistic estimates of the supplies of materials as a basis for planning in the using industries.Coal24. On the favourable assumption that the labour force in the industry,which is at present about 690,000, will only fall to an average of 680,000 for theyear 1947 and on the assumption that the five-day week comes into operationduring the year and that the present trend towards better output and attendancecontinues, it is estimated that the production of deep-mined coal will notappreciably exceed 180 million tons in 1947. If opencast production is put at12 million tons, this gives a total of 192 million tons against estimated minimum requirements (i.e., with present restrictions and no increase in exports, but asmall building up of stocks) of 200 million tons.25. By 1951 re-organisation and concentration on the lines recommended in the Reid Report should have begun to produce results, and in consequenceoutput per man should have shown considerable further improvement. On theother hand must be set the probability that by 1951 the manpower in the industry will have fallen to about 600,000 and that both the second weekly annual holidayand the reduction of the shift from 1\ hours to 7 hours demanded in the Miners&apos;Charter will have been granted. On these assumptions output in 1951 might amount to something between 190 and 200 million tons. Opencast production by that date is not likely to amount to more than 8 million tons, giving a total output figure of between 198 and 208 million tons. Supplies on this scale shouldbe sufficient to meet internal consumption and foreign bunkers but could leavenothing appreciable for exports.
26. Very great efforts will, however, be needed if manpower in the minesis to be maintained at the levels assumed in the foregoing calculations. It willt^e necessary for this purpose to secure :  -(1) that there shall be no losses from the industry except unavoidable wastage(from such causes as deaths, retirements, compensation cases, &amp;c)which may be put at 60,000 or more a year;(2) that special steps shall be taken to recruit and train as much adultlabour as possible;(3) that every inducment is offered to encourage juveniles to enter coalminingin preference to other industries.27. At present young men employed underground are not called up for service in the Forces. We think a decision should be taken now to continuethis arrangement for the next five years at least; This would have the advantage,not only of preventing losses which the industry cannot bear, but also of inducingyoung boys to enter the industry, as thereby they would be reserved from calling up. This, however, would only be effective if the arrangement was strictlyconfined to coalmining.28. We think that the seriousness of the manpower situation calls for making the fullest possible use of the resources of foreign labour. There is a risk that if foreign labour is used in the mines it may cause trouble, with ourown miners, and if this happened there would be no increase of total output:there might even be a fall. The Ministry of Fuel and Power advise that thebest way of avoiding trouble would be to employ the foreign labour in the formof gangs for development work, thus freeing our own miners for current production.29. Another step which would help to realise the estimates of productiongiven above would be to establish some special organisation for the building ofhouses for miners in connection with the new concentration schemes. The pro-vision of housing is indispensable for this purpose, and would be one of the most effective ways of attracting new adult recruits to the industry.30. Apart from the above-mentioned measures to maintain the man-power in the mining industry, we think the following are the main points to beemphasized : -(i) First priority should be given to everything needed to improve the mechanical equipment of the mines,(ii) It is clear that, whatever we do, shortage of coal is going to be a dragon the total production of the country for 3 or 4 years at least. Every-thing that will in any way contribute to increasing the production ofcoal must be pressed forward with all possible energy,(iii) We must press on with the conversion of engines and plant to oil-burning.Power31. There is at present a shortage of generating plant at the power stationswhich shows itself in shedding of load almost every day. The peak hours ofelectricity demand are lengthening and are now from 8 to 12 a.m. and from to 6 p.m.   Thus the greater part of the working day is affected.32. Maximum demand this winter was estimated last May at about 10million kilowatts. The demand has been rising so rapidly that this estimatewill be exceeded To supply this demand the Central Electricity Board have available less than 9 million kilowatts of plant, and their deficit this winter isabout 1-2 million kilowatts. A substantial proportion of their plant is over20 years of age and should be scrapped because it is liable to frequent break-down and is extravagant in its use of coal. Almost certainly in January and february the cuts in electricity supply will be nation-wide and will affectproduction seriously.33. The Central Electricity Board had prepared a programme for new plant for 1946 amounting to 940,000 kilowatts, but the delays in manufacturehave been such they have not got more than 220,000 kilowatts of this plant.34. The situation will deteriorate still further in the winter of 1947-48and 1948-49. It is certain that consumption will continue to grow, with the modernisation of industrial processes and the building of houses, schools, factories
and increased domestic consumption. The Central Electricity Board making allallowances for new plant anticipate that the deficit this winter of 1-2 millionkilowatts of plant will rise in the winter of 1947-48 to 1-6 million kilowatts andin the winter of 1948-49 to 1-7 million kilowatts. In other words, it can beexpected that for the next three winters there will be interruptions of electricity supply which will take place daily, which will be widespread and which willbecome more and more prolonged.35.   To relieve this situation the following measures are suggested : -(1) To give the very highest priority to the production of buildings and plant for the generation of power.(2) To ensure that projects for new generating stations are not held up bydelays in settling the choice of site.(3) To re-examine the balance between exports and home requirements inthe demands on the available production of heavy electrical plant.36. We feel that we must draw attention to the fact that at present thereis no differentiation in the supply of current between  priority and non-priorityconsumers. At a time when there are daily stoppages of production in essentialbasic industries and services due to shortage of power it does not seem sensiblethat non-essential consumers should be treated on a par with them. There aregreat practical difficulties in the way of any form of differential rationing of power, but we think that every possible means of restricting the supply of powerto non-essential consumers must be most seriously considered.Steel37. The man-power requirements submitted by Departments show a total labour force required in the metals and engineering industries at December 1947of 2,980,000, as compared with 2,784,000 actually employed at September 1946.After allowing for a small increase in the metal-producing industries themselves,the comparable figures for the engineering and investment metal goods industriesbecome : 1December 1947,September 1946 Estimated Percentage(Actual) Requirements Increase2,485,000 2,670,000 1\At least comparable increases are shown as required in other major steel-using industries such as building and civil engineering and building materials and equipment.38. It is impossible to correlate with any accuracy the rate of steelconsumption with numbers employed. This could perhaps be done more or lesssatisfactorily in the case of an industry like the motor industry, where steelsupplies are a major determinant of production and their availability directlygoverns the numbers of workers employed. But in other industries, e.g., theaircraft industry, where the use of steel is marginal, it might be highlymisleading to assume that the numbers of workers employed at any given time would vary directly with the amount of steel made available to the industry.Moreover, any correlation would tend to ignore factors such as substitution,changes in specification, economies or increases in consumption per head and the like. (At present there are indications that steel consumption per head is tending to rise.)39. The amount of steel which is allocated for use outside the general engineering and building industries is so comparatively small that, in so far as any comparisons are valid, they can be based on total steel used. The amountof steel available for home user in the current quarter (i.e., deducting directexports) can be put at the rate of about 9 - 2 million finished tons a year.40. If we assume a straight correlation between steel consumption and man-requirements, the total steel which would have to be available in 1947 to meet theneeds of the expanded labour force in the metal-using industries would have tobe nearly 1\ per cent, in excess of the 1946 supply. What are the hopes of gettingsuch an increase, i.e., 690,000 tons, or (assuming exports constant at, say, 1 million tons) a total steel supply of 10 - 89 million finished tons \ The maximum whichhome production might achieve will be perhaps  13,250,000  ingot tons or
9-4 million finished tons. We cannot safely count on.imports of more than the equivalent of 600,000-800,000 finished tons, giving, say, 10-10 - 2 million finishedtons, or a deficiency of the order of 700,000-900,000 finished tons.41. While, therefore, it is necessary to make reservations as to the validity of the correlation used in the foregoing calculations, these provide prima facieevidence to show that in 1947 the supplies of steel likely to be available will be insufficient to justify any increase in the labour force of the metal consumingindustries.42. Given the continuing stringency of steel supplies and the basicimportance of steel in all industrial activity, the question arises whether there ought not to be a more deliberately selective allocation of steel between various industries than has obtained hitherto, with the object of facilitating by this meansgeneral economic adjustment. We think that the adoption of procedure on theselines should certainly be further explored on the general lines which we haveadumbrated in paragraph 23. It must, however, be recognised that in presentcircumstances there is no guarantee that labour rendered redundant by a curtail-ment of steel supplies to one industry will flow to another industry (particularlyin another area) to which full supplies have been allotted. Moreover, steel is onlyone factor in production, and it does not necessarily follow that the allotmentto a given industry of its full steel needs will ensure that that industry canachieve maximum output.Building Programme43. The general background of the building position is that there is a vastamount of work to be done but that shortages of certain resources will severelylimit the amount which can be carried out in 1947. The main limiting factorsare not man-power but timber and, to a lesser extent, structural steel and the products of the clay industries. There may be bottlenecks in certain other essential raw materials and components, but these it should be possible to overcomeprovided that they are tackled vigorously and that care is exercised to ensurethat the action taken to deal with them does not simply result in the emergence ofbottlenecks elsewhere.44. Owing to material shortages under-employment is already showingitself in the building industry and, if there is a further rapid increase in thebuilding labour force, there is a grave risk that it will develop on a substantial scale. This would certainly thwart all attempts to increase individual output and would thus have a serious effect not only on building costs and on the morale of the building industry, but also over the whole field of the ProductionDrive. On the other hand, the man-power employed in the building materialsindustries is believed to be working at approximately the pre-war level of productivity.   We accordingly consider : (a) That everything possible should be done to man-up the labour force inthe industries producing building materials and components which arein short supply; and(6) That the rate of increase in the total labour force in the building industry should be kept under careful control, a target of about 1,300,000 at theend of 1947 being substituted for the present forecast of 1,370,000.(c) That efforts should be made to secure a better balance between thedifferent trades within the total building labour force.As regards (b) we understand that the rate of intake into the building industryis already showing signs of slowing down and that it is now thought that, even if no special steps were taken to control the rate of increase, the total building labour force would be unlikely to exceed 1,320,000 at the end of 1947.45. There will in any case remain the difficult problem in regard to theallocation of that labour force within the industry as a whole between (a) construction of new houses;(b) new construction other than houses;(c) concessions, adaptations, repair and maintenance and repair of war damage.
Speaking generally these three forms of building make different demands onmaterials. New houses involve heavy demands on timber. New construction,other than houses, makes heavy demands on structural steel. Repair and main-tenance makes more varied demands and can more readily be adapted to the materials available. We think that the three forms of building should each beconsidered in the light of the supply available of the particular material of whicha shortage would most seriously affect it. In other words, we think that theprogramme of new houses should be considered in relation to timber supplies,that of new construction other than houses in relation to structural steel, and thatany remaining man-power resources of the building industry should flow on to repair and maintenance work.46. The Minister of Health has indicated that he considers it wise to reducehis target for new houses to be completed in 1947 to 240,000 and also to limit newapprovals of tenders and issues of licences in such a way that the number ofhouses under construction but not yet completed at the end of 1947 will be about200,000. We welcome the proposal to limit the approval of tenders and the issueof licences. But we think it unlikely that sufficient timber will be availableto complete 240,000 houses in 1947. We suggest, therefore, that this targetshould be scaled down, say to 200,000 or 220,000, but even this reduced targetwill have to be subject to revision in the light of the timber situation, which is extremely uncertain.47. We understand that, on the assumption that present restrictions on maintenance and repairs were retained, about 60 per cent, of the total building labour force would have to be allocated to housing in order to get on new housinga total force of about 300,000, the number necessary to achieve a target of 240,000new houses completed in 1947. (This calculation was of course based on theassumption that the total building labour force would be 1,370,000 at the endof 1947; but it also made allowance for hold-ups, due to shortage of materials,which our proposals are designed to avoid.) If, therefore, it is accepted thatthe number of houses which can in fact be completed in 1947 will be less than240,000, it follows that, if under-employrnent or unemployment in the buildingindustry, with the consequences referred to in paragraph 45 is to be avoided, itwill be necessary either to increase the labour allocation for new constructionother than houses, or to ease up on the present restrictions on maintenance and repairs.48. There is an immense amount of work to be done on new constructionother than houses. At first sight, therefore, the obvious course seems to beto allow the labour force thus released from new housing to be allocated to new construction other than houses. But, if too much were done in thisdirection, the shortage of structural steel would begin to come into play.49. Whilst, therefore, we think that there may be a case for some small increasein the allocation to new construction other than houses, we consider that the measureon which we shall have to rely mainly in order to avoid unemployment or under-employment in the building industry is an increase in maintenance and repair work.We suggest that, as and when there are indications of unemployment orunder-employment in the labour force, the Government should be prepared at short noticeeither to raise the limit on the cost of maintenance and repair work whichcan be carried out without licence on all types of building, or to allow greater freedom in the issue of licences for work not involving materials in short supply.Whilst our main reason for making this proposal is a desire to ensure that thebuilding labour force is fully employed, we also consider that it is in the national interest that work on maintenance and repairs should not fall too far in arrears.Furthermore, some relaxation in this field might serve to offset the criticism of theslow rate of progress on the completion of new houses, which, though inevitablebecause of the materials situation, might be attributed to the deliberate act of theGovernment, if there were too substantial an adjustment of the allocation of thetotal building labour force in favour of new construction other than houses.50. If the allocation to the construction and repair of buildings other thanhouses is not raised substantially above 40 per cent, of the total building labour force, It will not be possible to carry out anything like the full departmental pro-grammes for this branch of new construction. Indeed, as stated above, shortageof structural steel would in any case be a limiting factor in this field It is there-[32881] c&apos;
fore, essential that, as in the case of new house construction, the programme ofother building construction should be controlled. This will mean that the numberof projects to be started should be carefully selected and should not be allowed toget out of proportion with the number which it is likely to be possible to complete.This control will be effected by the Headquarters Building Committee acting in consultation with the Investment Working Party.51.   To sum up, our proposals under this head are : (1) That every effort should be made to man-up the industries producingbuilding raw materials and components in short supply.(2) That the rate of increase in the total building labour force should bekept under control, with a target of about 1,300,000 by the end of1947.(3) That the programmes for the main sub-divisions of building work shouldbe closely scrutinized in relation to the special shortages of materialslikely to affect each of them.(4) That consideration should be given to scaling down the proposed target of 240,000 new houses to be completed in 1947 to a figure of, say,200,000 or 220,000.(5) That consideration should be given to allocating slightly more than40 per cent, of this total force to construction other than houses.(6) That, as and when there is any indication of unemployment or under-employment in the labour force, the Government should be prepared at short notice to allow some relaxation of the existing restrictionson maintenance and repair work.(7) That over the whole field of new construction great care should beexercised! by the Headquarters Building Committee to keep thenumber of projects started in proportion to the number of projects which it is likely to be possible to complete.IV. Summary of Man-power and Basic Supplies52. The foregoing examination of the supplies of the main basic commodities-ties required for production provides the elements for making an outline plan for the utilisation of the country&apos;s resources in 1947, and in the previous section on Man-power we have indicated some of the possible lines of approach to closingthe man-power gap. We now try to bring these elements together and to strike a rough balance sheet.53, But before coming to the figures, we want to make it clear that theproblems of planning cannot be solved by mere arithmetic. We give a numericalexpression to the various objectives in order to give size and shape to theproblem and to show roughly the order of magnitude of the different courses of action suggested. But none of the figures is more than a rough estimate, andif they are to be even approximately realised, the measures we suggest willrequire deliberate and energetic action. With these reservations, we summarisethe position roughly as follows : 54. The man-power gap at the end of 1947 is given in the Survey as-630,000, but this takes no account of foreign labour. In paragraphs 17-19 wehave stressed the importance of making full use of the 150,000 Polish soldierswhom we shall have in this country. It is, however, most unlikely that we shallbe able to get more than 100,000 of them into employment in 1947. This would reduce the man-power gap to, say, 530,000. The question for planning thenis how this deficiency is to be spread over the various requirements. Whichrequirements are to be reduced and by how much ? The specific suggestions madein the two previous sections were as follows : Paragraph 15 : a reduction in the requirements ofdefence    ...      .-..............      300,000Paragraph 44 (b): a reduction in the requirementsof the building programme     ...       ...       ...        70,000370,00055. We have also made certain suggestions about the employment of women(paragraph 20), and we have drawn attention to the numbers employed in central and Local Government (paragraph 16).   It is not possible to give any estimate
of tJhe additional numbers which might be made available under these, heads.The main effect of the suggestions about the employment of women would beto induce transfer from one form of employment to another.56. The figures given in paragraph 54 would reduce the man-power gapfrom 630,000 to 160,000. The saving of 300,000 on defence rests entirely withthe Government. If Ministers feel able to take the decision that this cut isto be made, the saving can be regarded as a certainty. The saving of 70,000in the building labour force can also be treated as a reliable figure once thedecision to scale down the target is taken. The inflow into the building industry has slackened a great deal lately and the further expansion of the size of theindustry can be very directly controlled by the scale of the training facilities provided by the Ministry of Labour.57. In addition to the specific reductions mentioned above, we havesuggested in paragraph 41 that there should be no increase in the labour forceof the metal-using industries above the present level. This, on paper, means a further reduction of man-power requirements by 185,000 (see the figures inparagraph 37), and if this reduction could be carried out in full, it would, in theory, over-close the gap by 25,000. It is, however, very problematical whether an actual reduction of this order in the metal-using industries can be achieved.It would mean that there was to be no further recruitment into these industriesbeyond what is required to make good normal wastage. There is no direct labour control by which this result can be secured. The only way of achievingit is to* announce clearly in advance what the Governments objective is andto bring home the facts of the supply situation to the employers. If the Govern-ment, in the published White Paper for 1947, shows the realities of the supply position in tine basic commodities and makes clear what are the limits of total supplies within which the allocations of materials must be made, this should help employers in planning the scale of their production programmes and shoulddeter them from taking on more labour than they will be able to make effective use of. Even so, the scaling down of the target labour force for the metal-using industries is not a thing which can be done with any certainty or precision.58. Moreover, we must point out that the figure of 630,000 itself under-states the true potential gap, as explained in paragraph 9. Finally, there is theconsideration that unless steps are taken to ensure that the distribution of man-power among civilian occupations matches the basic supplies needed in industry,there is the certain prospect of a large volume of under-employment. The effectof this is, of course, to increase still further the gap between resources and requirements.59. For all the above reasons we would impress on Ministers that though,on paper, the measures which we have proposed may seem at first sight to dorather more than is required, this is by no means the case. On the contrary, wethink that nothing less than the full combination of measures which we havesuggested will be adequate to meet the situation. We think that, taken together,these measures represent an adequate, but not more than adequate, plan for bringing requirements broadly into line with resources. And in addition to taking these measures to close the total manpower gap, it is imperative to do everything possible to ensure that the distribution of manpower between industriesmatches the distribution of the basic supplies.Y. Administrative Arrangements60. We do not attempt to go into detail in this report about the adminis-trative arrangements for carrying out the measures we have recommended. It isobvious that they will call for great care and firmness in making the allocations of materials among the using industries. The responsibility for this will reston the Materials Committee, and when Ministers have taken decisions in principle on the measures we have recommended they may wish to ask us to prepare a draftdirective to that Committee for their approval. The allocations to be made between the different industries will have to be very selective if we are to ensuree industries which are of highest priority in the national interest do not go short of supplies. The effect on the less essential industries will be serious. Itmay, in some cases, mean causing unemployment. There will, therefore, be some very difficult decisions to be taken, and in view of this we think that there ismuch to be said for reverting to the wartime arrangement under which theChairman of the Materials Committee was a Minister.[32881] c 2
61. Assuming that discriminatory allocations between different industries have been made in accordance with the priorities of the national interest, it still remains to try to ensure that the allocations are used for the production of thosethings which are needed most. It will not be possible to achieve perfect controlover the use of the materials between the different end-products. The variety ofend-products for the civilian market in peacetime is much greater than in war production, and it is therefore much more difficult to apply direct productioncontrols. Nevertheless, it should be possible to go a long way by the combination of materials allocations and production controls to ensure that the available supplies of the basic materials are used broadly for the purposes which are ofhighest importance for the national interest.YI. Consumption62. Whatever we do to increase our man-power resources, on the one hand,or to allocate our resources on the other, there will still be an excess demand whichmust remain unsatisfied, and in particular the consumers&apos; requirements can-not possibly be met in full. The Economic Survey does not attempt onthis occasion to quantify the total target consumption for 1947 as a percentageof total pre-war consumption. There are two reasons why a comparison of thiskind would be quite misleading. In the first place, it is not possible to makeallowance for changes in the quality of the goods and services which are availablefor personal consumption. A pint of beer at the moment is not of the same qualityas a pre-war pint, nor is a railway journey, standing in a crowded corridor, thesame as a pre-war journey seated in a half-empty carriage. Nor are retailpurchases obtained after considerable difficulty standing in a queue the same thing as an easy last-minute purchase of the same goods nicely packed anddelivered. Secondly, it is no compensation for restrictions on consumers&apos; choiceand shortages of essential commodities like food, clothing and durable household goods to be able to make increased purchases of less essential goods and services.For these reasons, the increases in the consumption of the particular goods or services (in many cases of a much-reduced quality) which are shown in Table 4of the Statistical Annex, cannot be measured against the important shortages of other more essential goods and services.63. There is, moreover, a further reason why statistics of the total con-sumption of the whole population will not coincide with the daily experience ofeveryone. The rise in the general level of wages and the great reduction in umemployment, coupled with rationing and priority schemes and the fact thattaxation takes more from the higher incomes than from the lower, has broughtabout a great redistribution of incomes, and this for certain important sectionsof the population has produced a real increase in the standard of living. Theagricultural workers, for instance, are far better fed and clothed to-day thanthey were before the war; and the whole of the working classes are eating moremeat and drinking more milk (and more beer, notwithstanding the dilution) thanthey did before the war. Thus in many commodities of which the average black-coated worker is conscious of nothing but acute shortage, the actual supply forthe population as a whole is at least as much if not more than the majorityexperienced before the war.64. There is, in present conditions, inevitably a considerable lack of balance between supply and demand for consumption goods and services. The totalspending power of the population has been much increased by the causes just mentioned, and this has only partially been offset by increased taxation, while at the same time the cost of foodstuffs and other essential goods is being keptdown by subsidies. The result is a big increase in the total effective consumptiondemand compared with pre-war, and it is clear that supplies of goods and services for personal consumption cannot be increased at all rapidly to meet this hightotal demand.. Indeed, in the case of many essential commodities (such asclothing) the supply will inevitably remain for some time below the pre-warlevels.65. The consumer, whatever we do, will have to continue to suffer. We must therefore look very closelv at all the other demands on our resources to see that liedoes not have to suffer more than can be helped. The most important of these other demands and the only one on which we can hope to operate (except the Forces anaother Government Services) is investment. In our previous report on the economic survey for 1946-47 (M.E.P. (46) 7) we drew attention to this question of thebalance between consumption and investment and we discussed it in terms of the
distribution of man-power between the Group I and the Group III industries, or,as they are called in the present Survey, the investment goods industries and the consumers&apos; goods industries. This is still the general planning problem, namely,to ensure that the investment industries do not take up too big a share of thecountry&apos;s productive resources at a time when we are hard pressed to meet theminimum requirements of current consumption.VII. Investment66. We do not think that this question should be approached on the lines ofmaking an arbitrary cut between investment and consumption. The essentialconsumer requirements are to eat, drink, be clothed and be housed. There arelimits to the extent to which resources can be rapidly shifted from meeting invest-ment requirements to supplying greater quantities of goods and services for personal consumption. Some such possibilities exist. As has been mentionedin paragraph 20, young women in Lancashire might be induced to leaveengineering works in order to go into the cotton mills. Within very strict limits,it might be possible to export more capital goods and less consumption goods.Finally, there are some sources of labour, and in particular foreign laboursuch as the Poles, which it may be possible to steer into consumption goodsindustries rather than investment industries; and if there is to be an appreciablecut in the size of the Armed Forces, it will be necessary to steer demobilisedmen (as far as is compatible with their reinstatement rights) into indus-tries other than those investment industries which, because of shortages ofmaterials, cannot absorb larger numbers without causing unemployment or reduced productivity. The supply balance-sheets for the main basic com-modities will show that the amount of investment which can be done in1947 is strictly limited, so that the pace of the investment programme must inevitably be slowed down. We do not therefore recommend that ministers should be asked to carve up the national product and set aside a particularslice for investment as a whole. Our approach is rather that we are trying to do too many things at once and that our task is to pick out the most essentialthings and concentrate on them. The keynote of our investment planning must beselectivity.67. For the priorities which should be observed we have referred to the listwhich was proposed earlier in the year by the Investment Working Party and approved by Ministers in L.P. (46) 95 (see Annex). We think that this statementof priorities still holds the field. The main emphasis of it (apart from setting out the obviously essential requirements) was on selecting those investmentschemes which will yield quick returns, and this should certainly be the guidingrule for 1947. We propose, therefore, that the existing machinery by whichinvestment schemes are scrutinised (the various authorities concerned beinggrouped under the general direction of the Investment Working Party) shouldcontinue, but that this scrutiny for 1947 should be more rigorously selective thanit has been hitherto.68. The decisions on the actual selections to be made can only be taken onthe merits of the separate schemes or programmes when they come forward to theappropriate body, and we do not think we can do more than offer certain general comments in amplification of the priorities which have already been laiddown. One thing, however, can be said at once: there is not a hope of carryingout the whole programme of investment, public and private, which is now beingcontemplated, under a period of five years from now. The National building programme, which is shortly to be placed before Ministers, shows how the building labour force is hopelessly inadequate to meet even the demands now in sight, let alone others which may be expected to mature later on. It is clear that a strictselection will have to be made among the schemes coming forward for approval,and this applies no less to those arising from measures of Government policy than to private schemes.69. In the field of public investment the production balance sheet for building discussed in paragraphs 43-51, shows that a limit must be set to the size of the building programme, and that there will have to be some difficultdecisions between the claims of housing, factory-building, and maintenance. Onthis we wish to say two things. First, we think that in some of the undermannedindustries, especially agriculture and coalmining, there is no single thing whichwould do so much to build up the labour force as the provision of adequatehousing.   We think that the housing programmes in agricultural districts and
in the mining districts should be given the highest priority and that every thing-possible should be done to speed them up. Secondly, we suggest that, in projectsinvolving the construction of new factories in the Development Areas it shouldbe. possible to combine the objectives of diversification of industry and full employment of labour with that of adding to the supply of essential goods,including goods for export. In tapping the resources of labour that have in thepast been wasted in the Development Areas, we should put more emphasis onthe contribution that this labour make can make to the relief of continuingshortages.. 70. In the field of private investment, we think that the main criterion in approving investment projects should be whether they will yield an early dividendin terms of output and competitive efficiency. We do not want to put a brake on investment which is needed to improve the productive equipment of industry if we do this, we shall pay heavily for it in 1948 or 1949 but we do want to scrutinise private investment projects very carefully and make sure that priorityis only given to those which will have this effect. Those which do, -will nearlyalways be of a kind which maike economies in the use of labour, so that the twoobjectives of getting an early increase of production and of improving our long-term competitive position Avill go hand in hand. These, we think, should be thetwin guiding principles of selection in the control of private investment in 1947.YI11. Conclusion71. We had originally intended to submit to Ministers a draft outline of a White Paper together with our comments on the Economic Survey, but thesituation disclosed by the Survey is so serious, and the decisions to be taken by ministers on some of the suggestions we have made are so difficult, that we donot feel in a position to suggest the lines of a White Paper until ministers have been able to consider the whole matter and take their decisions on thepoints which have been raised. We accordingly conclude by giving the followingsummary of the main points mentioned in the previous paragraphs to whichwe think Ministers&apos; attention should be directed.
Summary(I) There is a great and increasing gap between resources and requirements.We are trying to do too many things (paragraph 1).Balance of Payments(2) We must accept the target of a 50 per cent, increase over the pre-warvolume of exports in the second half of 1947 (paragraph 7).Manpower(3) The manpower gap at the end of 1947, even after requirements have beenscaled down, is 630,000 (paragraph 8).(4) Consideration should be given to a reduction of the target requirementsof manpower for the Armed Forces and their supply services by 300,000 by theend of 1947 (paragraph 15).(5) Attention is drawn to the numbers employed in the non-industrial CivilService and in Local Government, which together total about 1J million(paragraph 16).(6) Polish soldiers in this country should be employed in those industries inwhich the shortage of labour is most acute (paragraph 19).(7) Consideration should be given to calling up women aged 20 for nationalservice for a period of, say, two years, giving a choice between the Women&apos;auxiliary Forces, the Women&apos;s Land Army, nursing and hospital services.Industries in which there is a specially acute shortage of women (the chief ofwhich would be the textile industries) would be scheduled as reserved industries in which women would be exempt from oall-up (paragraph 20).(8) Attention is drawn to the additional burden resulting from raising theschool-leaving age (paragraphs 21-22).Coal (paragraphs 24-30)(9) (a) The shortage of coal will be a drag on our total production for atleast three or four years.   Everything possible must be done to increase output.(&amp;) First priority must be given to mechanising the mines.(c) A decision should be announced now that young men employed under-ground will not be called up for service in the Forces for the next five years.(d) Foreign labour might be employed in the form of gangs for development work.(e) Special efforts should be made to increase the provision of houses in mining districts so as to attract new adult recruits to the industry.(/) Conversion of engines and plant to oil burning must be pressed on.Power (paragraphs 31-36)10. (a) There is a shortage of generating plant, which will grow worse inthe next two years. There will almost certainly be nation wide cuts in electricity supply in January and February. Such cuts will have to be repeated in thewinters of 1947-48 and 1948-49, and the prospect is that they will be worse thenthan they are now.(b) The very highest priority should be given to the production of generatingplant.(c) The possibility of restricting the supply of power to non-essential con-sumers should be seriously considered.Steel (paragraphs 37-42)(II) (a) The departmental estimates for manpower requirements in theengineering industries in December 1947, would require an extra 690,000 tonsof finished steel.  No such increase can be looked for.(b) It follows that there will not be enough raw material to absorb any increase above the present labour force in the engineering industries, and every-thing possible must be done to prevent any further flow of labour into these industries.(c) Given the continuing shortage of steel supplies, there should be a moredeliberately selective allocation of steel between the various industries.Building Programme (paragraphs 43-51)(12) (a) Shortages of timber, structural steel and clay products-in that order of importance will be a limiting factor on the size of the building pro-gramme. Under-employment is already showing itself in the building industryowing to shortages of materials.
(b) The target labour force of the building industry at the end of 1947 shouldbe 1,300,000 instead of 1,370,000.(c) The allocation of the building labour force between the different formsof building should be varied in accordance with the supplies of the differentmaterials.(d) The target of new houses to be completed in 1947 should be scaled down from 240,000 to 200,000 or 220,000.(e) A rather higher proportion than 40 per cent, of the total building labour force should be allocated to new construction other than houses.(/) We should be ready to take up any slack by allowing a higher proportion to be employed on repair and maintenance.(g) Great care should be exercised by the Headquarters Building Committeeto keep the number of projects started in proportion to the number of projects which it is likely to be possible to complete.Summary of Manpower and Basic Supplies (paragraphs 52-59)(13) An estimate is given of the combined effect of adopting the measureslisted above, which are not more than is necessary to meet the situation.Administrative measures (paragraphs 60-61)(14) A Minister should be appointed Chairman of the Materials Committee,which should be responsible for the allocation of materials among the using industries.Consumption (paragraphs 62-65)(15) Consumption requirements cannot possibly be met in full in 1947.This makes it all the more necessary to see that investment does not take too biga share of current production.Investment (paragraphs 66-70)(16) The key-note of our investment planning must be selectivity. this applies both to public and private investment.(17) The existing priorities still hold the field. The main criterion mustbe whether investment projects will yield an early dividend in terms of output and competitive efficiency.E. E. BRIDGES.Treasury Chambers,Christmas 1946.annex extract from E.D. (46) 5 (Final)FIRST REPORT BY THE INVESTMENT WORKING PARTY&quot;6. In the first place, we indicate the following general description of priority classes which we think should be observed. (The order of these items isnot an order of ranking) : (a) Living accommodation (this includes not only housing but also war damage repairs and conversion of houses).(b) Exports, including both the production of capital goods for export andschemes of re-equipment for export industries which the Boardof Trade are satisfied must be carried through quickly; similarpriority should be given to capital equipment projects which will savesubstantial imports.(c) Capital expenditure which must be accepted as essential ancillaries ofschemes under (a) and (b) and which must be begun at the same time as those schemes if they are to be ready in time. The Ministry ofEducations programme should be regarded as falling in this category.(d) Food production.(e) Factory building and expansion of basic services in the development areas.(/) Arrears of maintenance and deferred renewals in cases in which it isquite clear that a stitch in time will save nine.(g) Capital expenditure which will contribute to a rapid expansion of fueloutput.(h) Projects which will break serious bottlenecks.&quot;
