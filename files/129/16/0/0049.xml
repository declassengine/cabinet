(47) 496th February.  1947.CABINETPALESTINEJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary&quot;of State for-the ColoniesUnder the authority given to us- by the Cabinet on22nd January (CM. (47)  11th Conclusions, Minute 2) we have spent the last ten days in exploring,  in conversations withrepresentatives of the Arabs and the Jews,  the possibility of finding some.settlement of the Palestine problem which mightbe broadly acceptable to all parties.      These conversations haveconfirmed our fear that there is no prospect of &quot;finding such asettlement-2. The Arabs have again put forward the plan which theypresented at Lancaster House in the autumn - that palestine should be given early independence as a unitary State with apermanent Arab majority.      They have, however,  indicated thatthey would be ready to discuss modifications of their politicalproposals If they were first given a firm assurance that -(a) we were prepared to exclude the possibility of partition as a solution;    and       ,. .&apos;1,,;!&apos;(b) we agreed that there should be no further jewish immigration into Palestine.3^   - We are satisfied that there is no possibility of moving the Arab Delegations from the first of these conditions.They are implacably opposed to the creation of a Jewish state in any part of Palestine,  and they will go to any lengths toprevent it.      Delegates representing the younger generation of arabs have stated their sincere conviction that theircontemporaries would take up arms to   .resist the imposition of partition.      Whatever doubts there may have been on this -pointin the past, we must now take it,  as one of the facts of thesituation,  that Partition would be resisted by the Arabs ofPalestine with  the support of the Governments and peoples of allthe Arab States.4. On the second condition,  about Jewish immigration,there is a possibility of some compromise.      The point on whichthe;&apos;;&apos;Arabs will insist to the last is that they must have somesatisfactory assurance that it will not be possible for the Jews,by continuing immigration,  to secure a majority in Palestine.For this purpose.,  however,  it is not essential to provide,  asthe Arabs&quot;are now demanding,  that there shall be no furtherJewish immigration at all.      Other safeguards less drastic than
this could secure the Arab objective of ensuring that theJewish community shall not, by immigration,  obtain an absolute majority in Palestine.      Provided that satisfactory assurances could be given on that point, we should not despairof securing some agreement on immigration.5o The Jews still interpret the Balfour declaration and the Mandate as implying a promise that a Jewish state will be established in the whole of Palestine.      their first suggestion was that we should rescind the White paper of 1939 and continue to hold the Mandate on a basis whichwould enable them to build the foundations of that State byunrestricted immigration and economic expansion.      We made itclear that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared tomaintain in Palestine a purely tutelary administration underthe protection of which; such a Jewish policy could be carriedout.      The issue we presented to the Jewish representativeswas the need to find some practical means of initiating inPalestine self-government evolving towards independence.The Jewish representatives then indicated that,while- still maintaining the justice of their full claim,  theywould be prepared to consider as a compromise proposals forthe creation of &quot;a viable Jewish State in an adequate.area ofPalestine&quot;.      They would not themselves propose a plan of partition, but expressed willingness to consider such aproposal coming from His Majesty&apos;s Government.6. The essential point of principle for the Jewsis the creation of a sovereign Jewish State.      And theessential point of principle for the Arabs is to resist tothe last the establishment of Jewish sovereignty in any partof Palestine.      These, for both sides,  are matters ofprinciple on which there is no room for compromise.      Thereis,  therefore,  no hope of negotiating an agreed e 111 em en t.7. In these circumstances we have tried to find asolution which,  even though it may not be acceptable to thetwo communities in Palestine,  is one which we couldconscientiously recommend and defend to public opinion inthis country and to the United Nations.
8, We have been reluctantly forced to the conclusionthat such a solution cannot be found along the lines of partition.      partition has certain intrinsic weaknesses.Whefeyer the frontiers were drawn,  large Arab minorities wouldbe left within the Jewish State.      The area left to the Arabscould not be economically self-supporting and even if it couldbe attached to Transjordan,  the standard of services which it now enjoys could not be meintained.      The location of Jewishsettlements is such that the Jewish-State would have toinclude the major economic assets of the Arab community.Thus, any scheme of Partition which would satisfy the jews would be demonstrably unfair to the Arabs.Apart from the merits,  we must also consider theconsequences of advocating partition.      If we did so, weshould have to face the resolute hostility of  the Arab world.Even if we were prepared to accept the consequences of thishostility,  it  is by no means certain that we could count onthe support of the Jews.      They have not been willing toput before us any detailed plan of partition;    but, fromthe general statements which they have made,  it is clear thatthey would expect to obtain under partition a very substantialarea of Palestine.      It is therefore most unlikely that theywould support any Partition plan which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould feel justified in putting forwardsFurthermore,   the existing Mandate gives us no authority to move in the direction of creating an independentJewish State,  whether under Partition or otherwise.      Forany solution along these lines it would be necessary forus to obtain the prior assent of the United Nations.      Weshould have little chance of securing the necessary two-thirds majority in support of any scheme of Partition;      For ascheme which was not endorsed by the Jews it is evendoubtful whether we could, rely on the full support of theUnited States.      The views expressed on behalf of theState Pepartment in recent telegrams leave us with theimpression that the United States Government will to theend remain an uncertain and unreliable factor  in this problem.9. In these circumstances we seek the authorityof the Cabinet to put before the ^r&amp;bs and the Jews thealternative plan outlined in the Arpendix to thismemorandum.This has as its primary object the developmentof self-government in Palestine, with the aim of enabling the country to achieve its independence after a short
transition period under Trusteeship.      It provides fora substantial measure of local autonomy in Arab and jewish areas;    and enables Arabs and Jews to collaboratetogether at  the centre.      It contains special safeguards for the &quot;human rights&quot; of the two communities.      it provides for the admission of 100,000 Jewish immigrantsover the next two years and for continuing immigrationthereafter by agreement between the two communities or,failing  that, by arbitration under the United Nations.Thus,  it  should go  some way towards allaying ^rabfears of unrestricted Jewish immigration, while avoiding the extreme course of denying to the Jews any furtherimmigration without Arab consent.* 0. This plan incorporates many features taken from tht, provincial Autonomy scheme and from the proposals put forward by the Arab Delegations.       It will not,  ofcourse, meet  the Jewish claim to sovereignty;    but  itdoes make reasonable provision for Jewish immigration andeconomic development.      It should meet the views of alarge number of moderate Jews throughout the world who donot support the more extreme claims of Zionism.It is consistent with the principles of theMandate;    but it acids,  what has hitherto been lacking,a practical promise of evolution towards independence by building up from the bottom political institutions rootedin the lives of  the people.The  initial steps in such a policy could betaken at once under the existing Mandate;    and if weconcluded that it was possible to do so, we could avoidtue practical difficulties which would arise in thecountry if there were a long interval between theannouncement of a new policy and its initiation afterapproval by the United Nations.      At the same time,  theplan is fully consistent with the Charter of the united nations, and provides for regularising the position bythe negotiation of a Trusteeship Agreement.      Thesefeatures would cause the United States Government tohesitate before opposing the plan.-A-
11. We recognise that these proposals offer no guarantee for the preservation of our military position in Palestineafter the five-year period of Trusteeship.      On the other handv/e do not think that either of the alternatives open to us would he more advantageous from a strategic point of view.If we had to refer the problem of Palestine to the Unitedhations without ourselves making any recommendation as to itssolution, we could have no guarantee that British troops wouldhe able to remain in the country even for so long as fiveyears.      And Partition,  far from conferring any strategicadvantages on us, might not only involve us in a heavy military,liability in Palestine,  but might also weaken our strategic position in the Middle East as a whole.   . At a time when it isone of our main pre-occupations to reduce our overseas military expenditure and to avoid any further slowing down in the plannedrate of demobilisation,  we should find it difficult to justifythe great military risks involved in a policy of Partition.From a purely military point of view, the most satisfactory solution would no doubt be for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to continue to administer Palestine under theexisting Mandate without applying for a Trusteeship Agreement.We are convinced,  however,  that the maintenance of british administration without reference to the United Nations wouldbe so strongly challenged that we should soon find our positionuntenable.12. We therefore ask for authority to put to the Arabsend the Jews the scheme outlined in the Appendix to thismemorandum on the understanding that,  if agreement were reached on this basis, we should proceed to give effect to it.If,  as is more likely,  we find that no agreement can be reached, we shall report to the Cabinet whether in our judgement this solution is likely to meet with any substantial measure of acquiescence from even one of the two communities in Palestine;    and shall Invite the Cabinet to decide whether his Majesty&apos;s Government would be justified, in bringing it into operation on their own authority pending the negotiation of a Trusteeship Agreement.If we; are unable to report any such prospect ofacquiescence, we believe that the only course then open toHis Majesty&apos;s Government will be to submit the problem to theUnited Nations,  explaining the efforts we have made to find, asolution but making no positive recommendation.p, B.A. C-J.6th January,1947
APPENDIX1.      Article 2 of the Mandate for Palestine defines  the responsibilities of the mandatory power in the following terms:-(a) To place the country &quot;under  such political,administrative and economic conditions as will secure the  establishment of the Jewish national ,.home, as laid down in the preamble&quot;.(b) To place the country under such conditions aswill &quot;secure the development of self-governingi nstitutions&quot;.(c) To safeguard the civil and religious rights of allthe inhabitants of Palestine,  irrespective of race and religion.Article 6 of the Mandate, which deals with jewish immigration and the settlement of the Jews on the land,reads in part as follows:-&quot;The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring thatthe rights and position of other sections of thepopulation-   are not prejudiced, shall facilitateJewish immigration under suitable conditions&quot;*2.      During-  the last 25 years, efforts have been made bythe Mandatory Government to associate the population of thecountry with  the Administration, but these have invariablybroken down because it has  not been possible to find a basisof co-operation acceptable   to both Arabs and Jews.      It has there fore not been possible to establish politicalinstitutions leading  towards self-government.3,      A time has come when development in the direction ofself-government can no longer be delayed.      So long as government is imposed from without, neither community hasthe incentive to develop that sense of responsibility without which the two peoples in Palestine cannot live together inharmony.      Forms of government must therefore be establishedwhich have their roots in  the people of the country and whichoffer a prospect of full independence within a reasonablyshort period.4.      To  this end it is proposed that the people of  the&apos; country shall be given a large measure of responsibility for localaffairs and  shall be  associated with the  central government as soon as the new policy is put into effect;    that british participation in the Government shall not continue for longer than Is necessary  to effect the transition from Trusteeshipto complete independence;    and  that a definite time limitshall be fixed for this period of transition.      The periodsuggested is five years.      In other words,  it is proposedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should administer a five-yearTrusteeship over Palestine, v/ith the declared object of preparing&apos;  the country for independence.
9 9 0d) fj Q%&apos;     Under these proposals. His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe carrying on the obligations which already rest upon them underthe liatsidate^      At the same time, they would be looking forward to an early termination of the Trust,  and would be acting in full conformity with the provisions of Article 76of the United Nations Charter,If it emerged from the present discussions that the initiation of such a policy would command substantialacquiescence from both communities in Palestine,interim arrangements in harmony with this policy could no doubt bemade In advance of its formal approval by the United Nations,60      The essential features of the proposal trusteeship agreement are outlined In the succeeding paragraphs.^ Lgoai^j^gy^nrmert7.      Areas of local administration would be delimited in sucha way as to include in each a substantial majority either of arabs or of Jews.      To the local Administrations the centralGovernment would devolve a wide range of powers, legislative^administrative and financial, including seme share inresponsibility for the police.      As the local administrativeboundaries would not have the character of State frontiers,it would not necessarily follow that all the Arab or all theJewish territory need be contiguous.8.      Safeguards would be provided for the rights of theJewish population in Arab areas and of the Arab population in Jewish are as.      The rights of these minorities wouldincludes(a) Adequate representation in local legislatures.(b) A reasonable proportion of posts in the localAdmi administration;(c) Freedom of religious practice, in accordance withthe status quo, including the maintenance of separate religious courts for matters of personal status;(d) The right to maintain their own educational institutions(e) The right to use their own language in their communications with the Administration and in.the Courts of Law,It would be a special responsibility of the HighCommissioner to ensure the maintenance of these rights.
Immigration.9*      The British Delegation oannot accept the contention ofthe representatives of the Jewish Agency that the rate of jewish immigration into Palestine as a whole .sheaid bedetermined by the Jews aloneo      Nor can they accept the demand of the Arab Delegations that, all Jewish immigration into palestine should cease f orthwith.     They do not contemplate-either a settlement which would bring to an end the developmentof the Jewish National Home,  or the admission of jewish immigrants without reference to the effect of their entry onthe rights and position of the population of the country.Any provisions made for future Jewish immigration must rest upon consideration for the wellbeing of Palestine&apos;as a whole.10.    With this end in view the Trusteeship Agreement wouldprovide for Jewish immigration, at a rate of A,000 monthly,for a period of two years.      This would guarantee the entry of approximately 100,000 additional Jewish immigrants.    Duringthe remainder of the period  of Trusteeship,  the continuanceof immigration and the rate of entry would be determined,with due regard to the principle of economic absorptioncapacity, by the High Commissioner in consultation with hisAdvisory Council;    and in the event of disagreement the finaldecision would rest with an arbitration tribunal appointed bythe United Natidns i.Land Trasfers11.    Control over transfers of land,  including the power toamend the existing Land Transfers Regulations, wculd be conferred cn the local authorities.Central Government12c    The High Commissioner wculd continue to exercise supremelegislative and executive authority.      He would, however,endeavour to form an Advisory Council so composed as toinclude representatives,  not only of the Arab and Jewishlocal Administrations, but also of labour and ether organisedinterestsc      Despite this composition, it is probable thatvoting in the Advisory Council would tend at first to followcommunal lines.      Since, however, the functions  of theCouncil would be advisory and not legislative,   the HighCommissioner would be required to give due attention to theviews of minorities.      On the conclusion of the trusteeship agreement,  the Jewish members of the Advisory Council wouldsupersede the Jewish Agency for Palestine as the officialchannel of communication between the Jewish community andthe High Commissioner.
*J 3 Afe? *3 U13.    During the period of trusteeship, the HighCommissioner would introduce Palestinians into his executive Council, and would progressively increase theproportion of Palestinian members in that Council.Economic ProvisionsIt shall he the duty of the central Government to stimulate the economic development of the country throughthe agency of development Boards including both arab and Jewish members.The central Government will be responsible for ensuring that adequate provision is made by the localAdministrations for the enforcement of minimum wage ratesand conditions of labour.Termination of Trusteeship Agreementlb-.    At the end of four years a Constituent assembly would be elected.      If agreement was reached between amajority of the Jewish representatives and a majority ofthe Grab representatives in the Constituent Assembly,the High Commissioner would proceed forthwith to takewhatever steps were necessary to establish the institutions of the independent State.15.    In the event of disagreement in the ConstituentAssembly, the various drafts prepared for its consideration and the record of its debates would be submitted to the trusteeship Council which would be asked to determine futureproc edure.Conclusion16.    Throughout the period of mandatory rule in Palestine,it has been the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government to laythe foundahons for an independent Palestinian S tate inwhich Arabs and Jews would, enjoy equal rights.      The stateof tension between the two peoples which has existedhitherto has continually thwarted the attempts of themandatory -power to progress towards this end.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to continue indefinitely to govern Palestine themselves merely becauseArabs and Jews cannot agree upon the means of sharing its government between them.      The proposals contained in thepresent memorandum are designed to give the two peoples anopportunity of demonstrating their ability to work together for the good of Palestine as a whole and so providing a stable foundation for an independent State.
