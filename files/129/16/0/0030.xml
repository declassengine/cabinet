-rmg nnRDMENT IS THE PROP^ OT HIS BRITANNIC MAWOggThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use ot..^....^fe9ftfta*r.JT0P SECRETG.&apos;r.(h7)   30CaBINET-TALES TIKEMemorandum by the - 3ccrctary of State for Foreign affairs.      The London Conference on Palestine is due to re-open on21st January.    The Cabinet -is how called upon to determine the line of policy we must follow in the opening stages ofthe Conference.2.      The many suggestions which have been put forwardresolve themselves into three main proposals(a) the plan for provincial autonomy drafted last july by the conference of British and Americanofficials;(b) a unitary independent State, as proposed by theArabs at Lancaster House;(c) partition, which the Zionists went.These proposals are examined in the memorandum annexed to this paper,3.      It is quite clear that proposal (a) in its present formis unacceptable to either Arabs or Jews, . Iroposal (b) isunacceptable to the Jews.      Proposal (c) is unacceptable to theArabs, -h.      To deal with (c)  first, partition would also be unacceptable to the United Nations, and I am advised that we could not giveeffect to this policy without previously obtaining the consent ofthe United Nations.      iorsonally, I would have no very violentobjection to partition if I thought it would prove to be asolution.      But I cannot conceive of the British Government,even aided by the United States, being able to carry partitionwith the requisite- majority.5.      We must therefore consider another line of action.    Wemust take the proposals made by the British and Americanofficials as our basis, while amending them in such a way thatthey point towards an independent unitary State and incorporatinginto them as much as possible of the Arab plan.    Wo must ofcourse make it clear that we cannot accept the Arab proposals on immigration,  though steps must be taken to prevent a realflooding of the country by Jewish -immigrants.
6.      With this as our aim, wo can ask the British &quot;delegation to re-open the Conference by tolling the Arabs that we have notbeen convinced that their proposals deal adequately with theproblem;    that wo have therefore not withdrawn our own plan;but that we are ready to examine with them the possibility of arriving at a compromise which would enable us to dischargeour obligations in x: ales fine and to satisfy world opinion.The Delegation would report constantly to the Cabinet, andits course of action would be&quot; subject to review as theConference proceeded,7,      If we allowed the Jews to insist on partition andthe creation of a -Jewish State (which was not promised inthe Balfour Declaration)  then wo would face defeat in theUnited Nations.    Even if we follow the plan of merging theArab and the British proposals, I think the issue will haveto go before the United Nations,.    But in that event I am satisfied that wo should got sufficient support.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.IhTH JANUARY.,  1947.
annex the Present position.     The London Conference on Palestine is due to re-openon 21st January.      All the States members of the i-^rabLeague will again he represented;  and on this occasionthere may&apos; also be a delegation representing the Arabsof Palestine.      The  Zionist Executive are precluded fromparticipating in the Conference by the terms of theresolution passed at their recent Congress in Basle, butthey are arranging to meet in London on 22nd January andwill be available for informal consultations which canbe held at the Colonial Office while the Conference proceedsin St. James&apos;  Palace.      It thus appears likely that the interested parties will be more fully represented in theforthcoming discussions than they were at Lancaster houselast September.2.      The British Delegation cannot profitably resume theConference with the Arabs,  or  open discussions with theJews, unless it has clear instructions from the Cabinetbased on a decision as to the objective at which british policy is aiming in Palestine.      Furthermore the localsituation in that country makes it imperative that thedecision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on future policy should be announced with the minimum of delay after theend of the forthcoming consultations3.    It is already clear that there is no hope of reaching a settlement by means of a tripartite agreement between.Arabs, Jews and ourselves,  or even of devising a policywhich His Majesty&apos;s Government could impose with the tacitacquiescence of both peoples.      If we are to undertake the responsibility for giving effect to a settlement ofthis problem, we must be prepared to carry it cut in the face of resistance from either Arabs or Jews,  or in the worst case from both.4.     The only alternative to a firm decision by HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and its resolute enforcement,  is  anattempt to divest ourselves of all further responsibilityfor Palestine by surrendering the mandate either to theUnited States or to the United Nations.      Even if we wished to transfer Palestine to the United States, and theUnited States Government  agreed to accept it, we should still have to effect the  transfer through the machineryof the United Nations.      We might announce our readiness to evacuate Palestine as soon as the United Nations wereprepared to establish an alternative administration.    Orwe might go further, and announce that our troops and civil administration would, be withdrawn on a given   date,whe.ther or not  the United Nations were then in a positioneither to. take  over the Government themselves- or appointanother State as a trustee.
5.      This possibility is not examined in the present paper, because at a recent Staff Conference it was decidedthat  the maintenance cf our right to station troops inPalestine is essential to the preservation of our strategic interests in the Middle East as a whole *      If this  opinion is accepted,  then we must remain in Palestine and accept responsibility for determining the future cf that country.60     Assuming a decision to stay in Palestine,  there appearto be only four possible policies for  the Cabinet  toconsider -(i) enforcing the plan for provincial autonomy whichwas approved in principle by the Cabinet last July,as a basis for discussion with -^arabs and Jews;&apos;     (ii) partitioning the country now into a Jewish Stateand an A.rao area which would he either absorbed into neighbouring ....rab States or grantedindependence in the same way as the Jewish area;(iii) negotiating with the mats, with a view to reaching agreement  on the establishment in Palestine of anindependent unitary State with a constitutionembodying certain features of the plan presented by the Arab Delegation at the first part of theLondon Conference.7.      Before further consideration is given to these threeproposals,  attention must be drawn to our position asmandatory for Palestine in relation to the United Nations,we are not committed by the terms of the Charter toplacing Palestine under trusteeship , but we are bound to observe the terms of a resolution passed with our concurrenceat the final assembly of the League cf Nations in April 1946.This resolution took note cf the expressed intentions of mandatory powers to continue to administer mandated territories in accordance with the obligations contained inthe respective mandates &quot;until other arrangements have beenagreed between the United Nations and the respectivemandatory powers&quot;.   ,8.      It is clear that we could neither partition Palestine,nor create an independent unitary State such as the Arabspropose, without previously obtaining the agreement  of theUnited nations .      ( On this point,  see CP. (47) 28).      Evenif we were to adopt the less far-reaching proposal for provincial autonomy, and although we should be within ourlegal rights in giving immediate effect to it,  there wouldbe strong political arguments against doing so without reference to the United Nations.      The fate of palestine is so undeniably a matter of international concern that&apos;weshall in any case be required to account for cur policythere.      The only doubt,  if we were to decide in favourof provincial automony, would be as to whether it was better to present the issue to the United Nations ourselvesor  to allow some  other Government  to take the initiative.This being our international position in the matter, wemust not overlook the probable reception by the united nations of any policy we decide to put  forward.
(i)   i rovincial Autonomy.9.      Under provincial autonomy as under partition,  the greaterpart of ialestine would bo divided into an Arab and a Jewisharea.    Their provincial Governments, however, while exercisingextensive powers, would not have control of foreign relations, defence or tariff policy, and their autonomy wouldhe limited by the emergency powers of a Central government under a British High Commissioner.    This system might boexpected to develop cither towards partition or towards theformation of a federal State;    the choice between these alternatives would not bo predetermined,,10.    This plan would avoid many of the practical difficultiesof partition:    e.g.  the impoverished .&apos;rab area would not be thrown back on its own financial ,resources, and since thecomplicated frontiers between the two areas would have only an administrative significance they would not cause the same degree of inconvenience.    It is probable that the Jews wouldresent provincial autonomy less bitterly than they would a unitary State with an Arab majority and possible that theArabs would find it less unpalatable than partition.    The jews would at least acquire a larger measure of control over theirown immigration and development.    And the Arabs would he given some guarantee against the further territorial extension ofthe Zionist invasion.    An initial period of disorder and violence might therefore bo followed by the reluctantacquiosconce of both communities.11.      The fact remains that the proposal for provincial autonomyhas been .formally and emphatically rejected by both the arabs and the Jews.    Its introduction would be resisted both bynon-co-operation and by armed rebellion on the part of bothpeoples.    And even if, for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs they were eventually to acquiesce in its operation,they would each continue the struggle for a final settlementmore in conformity with their national aspirations.    The jews would not relax their pressure for more territory nor theArabs theirs for loss immigration.(ii)    I-artition.12.      i artitioo is a vague word.    The meaning and consequences of any particular scheme of partition would depend almostentirely on where the frontier was drawn between the Jewishand the Arab&apos; States.    The frontier which, was considered by aCobinet Committee under the late Coalition Government wasbroadly similar to the line suggested as a provincial boundaryin the more recent proposal for provincial autonomy.      Itmay bo assumed that, if partition were adopted in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government  the frontier proposed would providefor a, Jewish Stale of roughly the same dimensions.13.      Partition on these linos would meet with the approval ofa substantial body of opinion in this country.     In principle thesolution of partition also has strong backing in  the United Statebut this is largely due to the knowledge that it would be acceptable (again in principle;)  to the Zionists.    The Zionists,however, would indignantly protest against frontiers of the kindunder consideration.      Even if the leaders -agreed in the last resort to administer a State within the area offered to them,thoy would first press the American Government to work for itsenlargement, and in the long run they would not be able to suppress irredentist movements in their State.    In those circumstances it is doubtful whether the settlement would commoncthe support of ianerican opinion.&apos; -5-
9 c6 5lu,.      A graver objection to partition lies in the effect which its enforcement would probably have on Anglo-Arab relationsgenerally.    The creation of a Jewish State even in the relativelyrestricted area now suggested would undoubtedly involve seriousinjustices for the Arab population of i alestine:    a large Arabminority under Jewish rule, the loss of a large proportion ofthe Arab community&apos;s taxable capacity owing to the inclusion of nearly the whole citrus,-growing area in  the Jewish State, and the severance of Arab Galilee from the rest of the Arab territory by a corridor of Jowish land.      Still more provocative of Arabresistance would be the fear that a Jewish State would be driven to pursue an expansionist policy.15.    The threat of partition would provoke an Arab rising in* alesti.no.    It is not possible to foresee precisely how strongthe revolt would be, how much active support it would receive from the Arab States, or how deep and lasting would be theeffect on the attitude of the Arab Governments and peoples toGreat Britain.    But the certainty of Arab hostility to partitionis so clear, and the consequences of permanently alienatingthe Arabs would be so serious, that partition must on this groundalone be regarded as a desperate remedy.    The risk cannot be excluded that it would contribute to the elimination of British influence from the whole of the vast Moslem area lying betweenGreece and India.    This would have not only strategic consequences;it would also jeopardise the security of our interest in the increasingly important oil production of the Middle Bast(See C.x.   (1+7) 11)..16.      As has already been said, partition could not be put intoeffect without the previous consent of the United Nations.    Itis most unlikely that this consent could be obtained.      Theadoption of partition as our solution for the Palestine problem would therefore expose us to an almost certain defeat in theGeneral Assembly, thus leading us back to our present situation,with the choice between continuing to govern ialestine inaccordance with the mandate or beginning again to search for analternative policy.(iii)    An independent unitary State.17.      The delegations of the Arab States at Lancaster House made proposals under which Palestine would be granted its independence,after a short period of transition, as a unitary democraticState with an Arab majority.    There would bo no further jewish immigration except by Arab consent.      The Jews would receiveconstitutional guarantees of their civil and religious rights,and of their representation in the legislative assembly in proportion to their numbers.    These guarantees could not be modified without Jewish consent.    It was contemplated that theindependent State would enter into Treaty relations withGreat Britain.18.      These proposals,  to which the British&apos;Delegation have notyet made any reply, are not acceptable in their present form.But if we decided to aim at agreement with the Arab States,  itwould probably be necessary to adopt their proposals as a basis for negotiation;    and there is reason to suppose that in thesecircumstances the Arab delegates could be induced to makesubs tan tial conce ssions.
2&amp;1 p19.    The main issue    on which the British Delegationwould have to demand modification of the Arab proposals isof course Jewish immigration.      It would not he possiblefor His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt a policy leadingtowards the  creation.in Palestine of an independentdemocratic State with an Arab majority unless  they were able git the same time, and as par.t of the same plan,  togrant a substantial number  of immigration certificates.It would have to be ascertained at an early stage in thediscussions that the Arabs were prepared to pay this price for a general settlement of the kind they have advocated.His Majesty:&apos;s Government would also have to satisfy themselves that  the position of the Jewish national home was adequately safeguarded in the constitution ofthe proposed independent State.      To this end they mightpress for extensive powers of local self-governmentapproximating to those contemplated in the plan for provincial autonomy,  thus enabling Jewish cantons to beestablished within the framewor.lt of the unitary State,30.    It is therefore not the Arab plan, but a settlementborrowing largely from that plan and worked out so faras possible by negotiation with the Arabs which forms thethird of the possible policies  considered in this paper.If the Palestinian Arabs, with their more intransigentattitude, do in fact attend the second part of theConference,   they will make it more difficult to reach any formal agreement.      But it is reasonable to expect that a settlement on these lines would be broadlysatisfactory to Arab opinion,.21.    The principal objection to this proposal is thatthe Palestinian Jews would not submit to it withouta struggle.      The  great majority of them have come tobelieve that the balfour Declaration contained or Implieda promise of a Jewish State;    they are better preparedthan the Arabs for an armed rising or a civil war;    and,whatever  the attitude  cf the Zionist Executive might be,leaders would be found to develop the present  terroristcampaign into a major rebellion.      This would occur duringthe period of transition in which ultimate responsibilityfor the maintenance  of order would  still rest with HisMajesty&apos;s Government.22.    The announcement cf this policy, and the ensuingclash between armed Jews and British troops in Palestine,would cause a Violent outburst  of indignation among the zionists and their  supporters in the United States,      Muchabuse of Britain would appear  in the Press,  and theAdministration might be compelled to associate itself in some way with this explosion of feeling.      It is howeverdoubtful whether American hostility towards us on this account would be either widespread or lasting.    It isalso to be noted that none of the other proposed solutionswould satisfy the Zionists, and that any one of them might therefore have a similar effect, differing no doubt in intensity,   on&apos; American public opinion.
25.    Indeed the outstanding merit of the proposal nowunder consideration is that it is the only one likely tohe supported by either of the  two directly  interested parties.It also- offers the best hope of progress towards asettlement by means of negotiation with either side.      these arguments for  the proposal become even more cogent if it is agreed that one of cur principal motives in retainingresponsibility for Palestine is to secure our political and strategic position in the Middle hast, which depends to do  great an extent  on the maintenance of Arab goodwill.26.    Any course which did not permit the British delegation to enter into-serious discussion with the Arabs would leadtc an early breakdown of the Conference,  and this mighthave disturbing consequences.     For the failure of this conference,  followed by the announcement of a policy inPalestine which was unacce -table to the Arabs, would berepresented in the Arab countries as a defeat for the arab league and for the present Arab Governments.     This wouldgive rise tc an immediate anti-British agitation in Iraq,-Syria and possibly elsewhere.      The present Iraqi andSyrian Governments, even if they were not swept away and replaced by Governments less friendly tc cur-selves, woulaprobably he  driven by fear  of revolutionary nationalism toadopt a hostile attitude towards us in relation to palestine and to connive at least in the transit cf arms and volunteers to support Arab disorder  in Palestine.27.    It is unlikely that our relations with the other arab countries would be so immediately affected.      But any policywhich aroused Arab hostility would be challenged in theUnited nations by the whole of the Arab bloc.      There canbe little doubt that in this event  the Soviet group wouldalign itself with the Arabs.      We should thus have helped to bring about a diplomatic combination which it shouldbe one of the first aims cf our policy to prevent, andwhich if it lasted would weaken our position not only inthe Middle .^ast but also at the meetings of the United Nations.28.    Finally,  a policy aiming at  the early concession of independence to a unitary Palestinian State constitutedon democratic principles would be in accord with the prevailing trend of world opinion on the treatment of dependent areas.      It  would therefore be more likely than any other- policy to command the approval of the United Nations,
