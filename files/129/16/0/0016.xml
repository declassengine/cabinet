SECRET Copy No    9[)CP. (47) 166th January, 1947CABINETUNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY:   REPORT  ON second part OF FIRST session memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues, for information, a series of notes (attached at annex) on the way in which the United Nations Assembly dealt with some ofthe major items on its agenda. These notes do not claim to be more than asummary, and my colleagues directly concerned may well wish to amplify andcomment on certain specific questions from their own standpoint.2. Reviewing the work of the Assembly as a whole, a journalist is reportedto have said: &quot; The Assembly has at least succeeded in giving fresh life to ahorganisation which the activities of the Security Council during recent monthshad gone far towards destroying.&quot; I am inclined to agree with this estimate.I should not wish to claim that the picture is uniformly rosy. There are many important questions on which the Assembly&apos;s decisions (in so far as they can properly be termed decisions) are unsatisfactory. But the conclusion I reachis that the Assembly has laid the foundations for constructive, and in some oasesvery important, tasks. In the field of disarmament, the first steps have been taken towards working out plans for the proper co-ordination of the twin aims of security and disarmament, based on the principle, now happily accepted by allthe Great Powers, that an adequate international system of verification andcontrol must form an essential part of any system of disarmament. There hasbeen no formal solution of the veto problem, but I am not without hope that the strong arguments used by the United Kingdom Delegation against allowing theunanimity vote to hamstring all real progress in the Security Council have had some effect upon the Russians, and that we may in future see some mitigationof their existing practice in this matter. Finally, the establishment of the trusteeship Council, in which the United Kingdom have from the outset playedthe leading part, is a positive achievement of a high order and sets the finishingtouch on the full organisation of the United Nations.3. All in all, I think that we oan look back on this session of the Assemblywith a good deal of sober satisfaction. It is too early yet to say how far we can hope for firm progress, and in questions such as that of disarmament it is clearthat the major difficulties have still to be confronted. None the less, providedthat the United Nations Organisation does not try to run before it can walk orto do too much too quickly and there is some danger of this progress can bemade. One of the lessons taught by this session of the Assembly has, I think,been that the Soviet Government are anxious to see the United Nations succeed,even if in accordance with their own views and for their own ends. As and whenit becomes possible to work more harmoniously with the Soviet Union in general,we may look for still further progress in the achievements of the United nations organisation itself.E.

Refugees.I. -United Nations Headquarters&quot;.Annex A.-Troops and Disarmament(i) Troops (A Hied troops in foreign countries)The Soviet Government put before the Assembly two motions dealing witharmed forces, disarmament, &amp;c. The first of these was a resolution, which theSecurity Council had refused to place on its agenda, asking for information aboutthe numbers of United Nations troops on the territory of other United Nations.In the Security Council the Russians had alleged that the resolution was promptedby the anxiety which the presence of these troops was said to cause to&apos; the various countries. When the matter was raised at the Assembly M. Molotov related thedraft resolution not to this alleged political difficulty but to the importance ofthis information to the Security Council and the Military Staff in estimating theforces which would be necessary to compose the international force underArticle 43 of the Charter.2. It was extremely easy to expose the fallacy of this argument since partialinformation of this kind would clearly be useless to the Military Staff Committee.M. Molotov thereupon changed his ground and related the resolution to disarma-ment describing the information as a first preliminary objective. He did not stickconsistently to this argument either, but on occasions went back either to article 43 or to the original political basis of the resolution.3. The United States Delegation took the view that information could begiven about troops provided that it included troops in ex-enemy territories andon home territories. The United Kingdom Delegation, in moving an amendment to the Russian proposal containing the United States points, added further thatan effective system of verification must also be set up. At one point M. Molotovsaid that he would accept disclosure of home troops and verification if&apos;&apos; armaments &apos;&apos; were added to armed forces, thereby completely changing thenature of the original proposal. It looked as if this proposal might have beencarried, but the Attorney-General intervened by proposing that such information should only be given after international machinery for verification had beenestablished. This matter has been somewhat misreported in the Press. The fact is, however, that when Sir Hartley Shawcross made it quite clear that disclosure of armaments could only be accepted if the establishment of a system of controland inspection, to the satisfaction of the Security Council, were made a condition precedent to the giving of information, M. Molotov showed that he was notprepared for so complete and immediate a. system of inspection and control.Ultimately the French Delegation and the President of the Assembly suggestedthat the subject could be covered by a request to the Security Council to examinewhat information should be given to it under the appropriate paragraphs ofthe disarmament resolution (see part (ii) of this Annex). The Russians did not wish to accept this, but the Assembly, which had grown somewhat tired of thewhole subject and was satisfied with the disarmament resolution, voted forM. Spaak&apos;s suggestion by a big majority.
4. This result was satisfactory since, although the Americans volunteereda statement containing a good deal of information about their troops abroad,the final resolution conformed to our point of view that the matter was one whichreally concerned disarmament as a whole. It meant in effect that a resolution which had not been put forward in good faith had been sidetracked by theAssembly and something much more satisfactory substituted. Moreover, the line taken by the United Kingdom Delegation forced M. Molotov into a useful state-ment that, &quot; in principle,&quot; he accepted international supervision throughinternational agents and not subject to the veto.(ii) DisarmamentThe proposal for a resolution urging disarmament was introduced unexpec-tedly by the Soviet representative after the General Assembly had begun. the motives of the Soviet Government were probably compounded of (a) a genuinedesire for a general reduction of armaments, (&amp;) a wish to create an opportunityof appearing as the progressive champions of peace (both (a) and (b) also offeringan opportunity of still further improving their position vis-a-vis other countries on the borders of the Soviet Union), and (c) a hope that by opening up thequestion of disarmament on the widest possible front, the decisive advantageenjoyed by the United States in their possession of the atomic bomb mightsomehow be circumvented. The issue was also complicated by the previous actionof the Soviet Government in raising in the Assembly the question of troops onforeign soil(see Part 1 of this Annex).2, The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government was based on the followingfour points : (1) The over-riding requirement of the peoples of the world was security(as exemplified by Article 43, &amp;c, of the Charter), and no schemeof disarmament should be adopted whose effect would be to decreaserather than increase confidence and a sense of security : on the otherhand, consideration of disarmament and the organisation of securityshould go hand in hand.(2) It was vital that any plan for the limitation of armaments should includeadequate safeguards by way of international inspection and control.(3) There must be no unilateral disarmament, and it must not be open toany one country to ignore the provisions of any convention for thelimitation of armaments in the knowledge that the unanimity rule inthe Security Council could be employed to prevent enforcement action.(4) The Atomic Energy Commission should be allowed to continue its workon the grounds that the control of atomic energy raises a number ofunique problems distinct from the problems of general disarmament and that it has already made considerable progress in the study ofthese problems on which it has been engaged pursuant to the AssemblyResolution of 24th January, 1946.3. There can be no doubt that the principles enunciated in the resolution on the limitation and regulation of armaments finally adopted by the general assembly cover the greater part of these requirements. This may be regardedas a highly satisfactory result, particularly since the purely political andmischievous aspects of the two Soviet items, on troops abroad and disarmament,were successfully submerged in the General Resolution, and the way is now open for the Security Council to embark upon a constructive study of the inter-connected problems of security and the regulation of armaments.4. The outstanding feature was the acceptance by the Soviet Governmentof two vital elements of disarmament: (a) the creation of an international system of control and inspectionoperating through special organs which shall derive their powers and status from the convention or conventions under which they are established;(b) the implication of the above-mentioned provision (if it may be taken at its face value) that these special organs may be able to take their decisions by a simple majority or some other system of voting whichdoes not require the unanimity of the five Permanent Members.\   \l sJl0uld&apos; however, be emphasised that in accordance with the Charterthe Assembly resolution the plans and draft conventions have to be approvedhe Security Council Where the unanimity rule applies; and even if such13796   [32972] B 2
a scheme were adopted the fact remains that major violations of it would quite be dealt with by the Security Council where decisions to take enforcement Iaction can be blocked by any one of the five Permanent Members which wisMto protect itself or one of its satellites.   A scheme of disarmament cannot&apos;provide any genuine security unless this loophole is closed.   It is not easy tosee how this can be done within the framework of the Charter without intro-ducing proposals which would almost certainly lead Russia to veto the wholeplan in the Security Council.6. It should be added that the Dominions of Canada and Australia -with whom we worked in close co-operation, took a most active and useful part the discussions.ANNEX BThe VetoThe discussions by the General Assembly on voting procedure in the security council have apparently left matters exactly where they were before. It wasmade perfectly clear that the majority of the United Nations, including four outof the five Permanent Members, were dissatisfied with the performance of theSecurity Council; but both in the public sessions, and in the private discussions which took place between the Big Five on the initiative of the United Kingdom,the Soviet representatives reacted strongly against any suggestion for improving the Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, and of course against the ideaof amending the Charter. They maintained stoutly that the right of veto had never been abused, that agitation for reform had been sponsored by the UnitedKingdom and the United States through their stooges, that the unanimity of thefive Permanent Members was essential to the effective working of the united nations, and that the way to obtain unanimity (so the unspoken argument ran)was always to accept the Soviet point of view.2. In practice, however, it may well prove that the debate has done somegood. The Soviet Government is not entirely indifferent to a general condem-nation such as was apparent in the discussions of the veto; and it may not becoincidental that at the latest meeting of the Security Council the Soviet repre-sentative began to move a small distance towards a more co-operative attitude.^He consented to a Commission of Enquiry to examine both sides of the Greeknorthern frontiers, and once abstained from voting without claiming that his action counted as a veto.) It may well be that the most hopeful development willbe the growth of an understanding, based on custom rather than formal rules, thata permanent member should abstain from voting instead of casting an adverse vote in cases where the proposal is not to his liking but vital interests are not affected.ANNEX CSpainIt was clear from the outset that the Spanish question was bound to bediscussed at the Assembly and that there would be a very considerable volumeof opinion in favour of drastic action being taken. I had at first contemplated that when the Spanish question came up for discussion, the United kingdom delegation should endeavour to have thoroughly examined the question of theextent to which the United Nations were entitled in view of Article 2 (vii) ojthe Charter to take action against a country mainly on account of its form ofGovernment a matter essentially of domestic jurisdiction. In view of tieimportance of the question of principle involved. I thought it would be very desirable to get this legal issue settled at the outset, and furthermore, I hopthat in this way it might be possible to delay or prevent any drastic action beingtaken in respect of Spain. In the event, however, the pressure for definite action being taken against Spain was too strong and the reluctance of most other delega-tions to face the &quot; domestic jurisdiction &quot; issue was too great to allow this coui*to be pursued.
2. I then thought that the best line to follow might be for the UnitedKingdom to take the initiative in bringing forward a resolution which, whilecondemning the Franco regime and recommending that as long as Francoremained in power, Spain should be debarred from all conferences and activitiesheld under the United Nations auspices, would not recommend any more drastic action against Spain and would merely call upon the Spanish people to get rid of Franco as soon as possible and set up an interim Government pledged to theearly holding of elections. Subsequently, it was arranged that instead of theUnited Kingdom Delegation taking the initiative in this matter, the United states delegation should sponsor a resolution in very similar terms. Here again, how-ever, it soon became clear that there was a large body of opinion in the assembly which expected considerably stronger steps to be taken against Spain. Severaldelegations were in favour of the imposition of economic sanctions and many others supported the idea of breaking off diplomatic relations. In effect, whenthe United States resolution was discussed by the Special Sub-Committee set up toconsider Spanish questions, it was radically amended by the insertion of a paragraph calling for the early breach of diplomatic relations by all members ofthe United Nations. Furthermore, the French Delegation brought forward aproposal recommending that the United Nations should stop all imports of food-stuffs from Spain in the future:3. When this amended resolution was considered by Committee No. 1, theAmerican proposal to reinstate their own comparatively anodyne resolution was defeated. On the other hand, the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendation in favourof the breach of diplomatic relations was also defeated. For a time it looked asif there might be a complete deadlock and as if it would be impossible to reach anyconstructive recommendation in respect of Spain at all. A way out of the impassewas, however, found when the Belgian Delegation resuscitated an earlier proposal of theirs that those United Nations who were represented in Madrid by Ambas-sadors or Ministers Plenipotentiary, should be invited to withdraw them withoutdelay. I had already been authorised to agree to such a proposal in the last resortand the United Kingdom Delegation, therefore announced that it would vote infavour of such a recommendation. This initiative resulted in an immediatebreaking of the deadlock, the dropping of more drastic proposals and the defeat of the French proposal.4. Unfortunately, however, Committee No. 1 also adopted a further Belgianproposal to the effect that if within a reasonable time a suitable interim Govern-ment had not been formed in Spain, the Security Council should consider what further steps should be taken in order to remedy the situation. This proposal was clearly dangerous and implied that the Security Council might in certaincircumstances be justified in taking active steps against Spain if a suitablealternative Government had not been formed. The United Kingdom Delegationmade it clear that they could not approve such a proposal.5. When the Spanish question was finally considered by the general assembly itself, Committee No. l&apos;s resolution, including both the recommendationregarding the withdrawal of Ambassadors and the recommendation for further action by the Security Council was adopted by more than a two-third&apos;s majority.The United Kingdom Delegation, however, again made it clear that they objected to this last proposal.6.   The upshot of the resolution passed by the General Assembly is that:  (i) all Ambassadors and Ministers Plenipotentiary have to be withdrawnfrom Madrid;(ii) as long as Franco remains in power Spain is debarred from &quot; member-ship in international agencies established by or brought into relation-ship with the United Nations, and from participation in conference or other activities which may be arranged by the United Nations or bythese agencies &quot;;(iii) &quot; if within a reasonable time there is not established a Governmentwhich derives its authority from the consent of the governed, com-mitted to respect freedom of speech, religion and assembly and to the prompt holding of an election in which the Spanish people, free fromforce and intimidation, and regardless of party, may express theirwill, the Security Council will consider adequate measures to be takenin order to remedy the situation &apos;&apos;[32972] c
7. As regards (i), the only country of importance to be affected by thedecision to withdraw Ambassadors is the United Kingdom. Our Ambassadorhas already left Madrid. The withdrawal of an Ambassador is never a very effective gesture and I was reluctant to agree to it in this case. It was clear,however, from the proceedings in New York that had the United Kingdom Dele-gation not accepted such a proposal, either some much less acceptablerecommendation such as one for the complete severance of diplomatic relations might have been forced on us or else the United Nations would have been unableto reach any conclusion at all about Spain and would in consequence have lostgreat prestige in the eyes of world opinion. In fact, to accept the withdrawal of ambassadors was, in my view, the least of several alternative evils.8. As regards (ii), the exclusion of Spain from United Nations conferences and agreements will have certain practical disadvantages e.g., it is obviously notin the general interest to exclude Spain from international health arrangements.On&apos;the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government will remain free, if they so desire,to carry on bilateral negotiations with the Spanish Government on trade and othermatters, or to press for the inclusion of Spain in international meetings or con-ventions which are not held under the auspices of the United nations organisation.9. As regards (iii), this recommendation is, as I have said above, open to serious objection, though it must be admitted that even had it not been passed,there would probably be no way of preventing some other country from bringing the Spanish question before the Security Council in some months&apos; time. -On theother hand, the fact that the General Assembly has felt able to take certain actionin respect of Spain on account of the form of the Spanish regime, without taking into consideration Article 2 (vii) of the Charter and the !.&apos; domestic jurisdiction &quot;issue has set a precedent which may be embarrassing in the future.10. It is too early yet to say what effect the General Assembly&apos;s action willhave on the Spanish situation. The immediate effect is likely to strengthenFranco&apos;s position with his own people and to increase the general feeling amongSpaniards of resentment of foreign intervention. On the other hand, the removalof Ambassadors and the growing feeling of ostracism may eventually convince the spaniards that it is in Spain&apos;s own interest that Franco should go and mayencourage the various Opposition groups to get together to establish a commonprogramme. There are, indeed, already signs that events of the last few weekshave aroused a good deal of nervousness in Government circles and a feeling thatFranco&apos;s days may be numbered.ANNEX DTrusteeship and Colonial Questions(i) TrusteeshipWith the approval of the Assembly of eight Trusteeship Agreements, andthe setting up of the Trusteeship Council, the trusteeship system has now comeinto force.Draft agreements for Tanganyika, Togoland and the Cameroons under united Kingdom mandate were submitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Inthe Fourth Committee numerous amendments to the drafts were proposed, inparticular by the Indian and Soviet delegations. A certain number were accepted,but the United Kingdom Delegation, pointing out that the drafts before theAssembly already differed in nearly every article from those originally drawnup by His Majesty&apos;s Government refused to accept the following major amend-ments which were pressed strongly by India and the Slav bloc.-- (a) Omission of the words &quot; integral part &quot; entitling His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to administer Togoland and the Cameroons jointly withneighbouring British territories. For practical administrativereasons we attached importance to retention of this provision.(b) Provision that any areas where defence facilities (bases, &amp;c.) are estab-lished should be declared &quot; strategic areas &quot; and brought under theSecurity Council within the framework of agreements to be concludedunder Article 43 of the Charter (special agreements relating to systemof international peace and security).
(c) Provisions determining where sovereignty resides in trust territories.The United Kingdom Delegation objected to this on the grounds thatit was a highly complex matter of international law and not appro-, priate for inclusion in the agreements.(d) Provision that trusteeship agreements should have a validity of ten yearsand then be subject to review. The United Kingdom Delegationobjected to this as the trusteeship agreements and the Charter itselfalready provide for revision when necessary.The General Assembly approved the United Kingdom agreements on13th December substantially as they were submitted by 41 votes to 6 with abstentions.The Soviet Union voted against the agreements on the grounds that theyviolated the Charter. They argued that provisions of Article 79- (agreement of states directly concerned) had not been complied with, and that the defenceclauses should have been subject to supervision of the Security Council. Theapproval of the agreements by the Assembly was, however, ruled by the Chairmanas entirely regular. As regards the question of &quot; States directly concerned,&quot;the Assembly did not attempt to define the phrase. The position is that no claimshave been either waived or admitted. The Soviet view that all the Big Fiveshould automatically be regarded as &quot; States directly concerned &quot; is not yetrecognised nor is India&apos;s claim to be a &quot; State directly concerned&quot; in Tanganyika.It should be noted that the Soviet Union made it clear that they intend to presstheir claim to be regarded as a State directly concerned in any trusteeshiparrangements in connexion with the Japanese Mandated and other JapaneseIslands and with the Italian Colonies.As a result of the approval of trusteeship agreements the Trusteeship council has been set up, consisting on the one hand of the administering Powers, i.e.. theUnited Kingdom, France, New Zealand, Australia and Belgium; and on theother of non-administering Powers, i.e., United States, U.S.S.R., China (the three other members of the Big Five), Mexico and Iraq (elected for 3 years).(ii) Non-Self-Governing TerritoriesConsiderable discussion developed on this subject and a separate sub-Committee of the Fourth Committee was set up to deal with it. In the event the Assembly took the following action :- (a) An ad hoc Committee has been elected, to meet shortly before the next session of the Assembly, for the purpose of scrutinising information on economic, social and educational conditions in non-self-governingterritories submitted to the Secretary-General by member States inaccordance with Article 73 (e) of the Charter.(b) A resolution was adopted in favour of calling regional conferences ofnon-self-governing peoples to enable them to &apos;&apos; express their aspira-tions.&quot; The initiative in calling such conferences is left with theStates responsible for the administration of such territories and not(as was originally proposed) with the Economic and Social Council.Further comments on the above subjects will be circulated later by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.ANNEX EIndian-South African Dispute on Treatment of Indians in South africa the instructions given to the Delegation by the Cabinet in the matter were--(a) To avoid being drawn into discussion of the merits of the case;(b) To maintain the view that the matter was one of domestic jurisdictionand so excluded from the competence of the Organisation by article 2 (vii) of the Charter and if necessary to support a reference of the matter to the International Court for a decision upon this point.2. The debates on the question in the joint 1st and 6th (Political and Legal)Committees were long and bitter, and turned in the main not on the point whetherthe matter was one of domestic jurisdiction, but whether human rights werebeing violated.   The United Kingdom Delegation, in their efforts to maintain
impartiality, were singled out for attack by India as giving support to whatthe Indian Delegation termed the racial discrimination policy of the UnionGovernment.3. In the end this first major item to come before the Assembly dealingwith human rights was decided on the emotional and political rather than thelegal plane. A resolution was adopted which amounted to a moral defeat for SouthAfrica. It declared that the treatment of Indians in the Union should be in con-formity with international obligations and requested the two Governments toreport to the Assembly next year the measures adopted to this effect. Theposition of the United Kingdom Delegation as between India and South Africawas extremely delicate and our attitude may be held against us by India inthe future.ANNEX FSouth-West africa the instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation as approved by theCabinet, were to take the line that His Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfiedas to the steps taken by the Union Government to consult the inhabitants of South-West Africa regarding their future, in other words to agree that the case for incorporation had been made out.2. India and the Soviet Union were the chief critics of South Africa, whosemethods of consultation with the inhabitants were questioned, though a numberof delegations acknowledged that South Africa had behaved well in not actingunilaterally and in bringing the case before the United Nations. Strong effortsby the United States Delegation and others to soften the blow for South Africaby a resoluion taking note of South Africa&apos;s case, by stating that the factsbefore the Assembly were not sufficient to justify it approving incorporation atthe present Session, were defeated. The anti-South Africa and pro-under dogfeeling of the Assembly finally expressed itself in a resolution which, takingnote of South Africa&apos;s case, called upon the Union Government to submit atrusteeship agreement for South-West Africa. The United Kingdom delegation and others argued that the Charter did not make it obligatory upon States toplace territories under trusteeship, but the feeling of the Assembly was against them. Field-Marshal Smuts stated that, pending other arrangements, the UnionGovernment would continue to be guided by the principles of the mandate inadministering South-West Africa.3. In this matter, as in the case of the India-South Africa dispute, theUnited Kingdom earned the grateful thanks of the South African Governnment,but drew upon herself a large share of the criticism and feeling against&quot; Imperialism&quot; in general.ANNEX GEconomic and Social questions in the economic field the Assembly tackled two closely-connected problems,one arising from the approaching end of U.N.R.R.A. and the other dealing inmore general terms with the rehabilitation of devastated areas.2. Despite Mr. La Guardia&apos;s appeal, supported by the recipient countries,for the establishment of an Emergency Food Fund, the United States thesis,which was supported by the United Kingdom that international action to meetthe residual need between the end of U.N.R.R.A. and the harvest of 1947 shouldbe simple and speedy, and on a bilateral basis, was adopted with only slightmodifications.3. No new organisation to replace U.N.R.RA. has, therefore, been created,but the Assembly recognised that certain countries would need financial assistancein 1947 to provide for imports of food and other basic essentials of life and, forthis purpose, established a Special Technical Committee whose function is to study these countries&apos; requirements, the resources available to them to meet them,
and the financial assistance in the light of the above which they, might require. ( 5The full exchange of information on needs and availabilities will be undertaken by the.United Nations Secretariat as the co-ordinating body.4. The Assembly also authorised the Secretary-General to assume certainadvisory social welfare functions of U.N.R.R.A., and to include in the 1947United Nations budget the necessary funds for this purpose. The Assemblyfurthermore endorsed the Economic and Social Council&apos;s recommendation forthe creation of an International Children&apos;s Emergency Fund which will consistof voluntary contributions and assets made available by U.N.R.R.A. A sumof 1550,000 has already been given to the Fund by the American people. the health activities of U.N.R.R.A. are in process of transfer to the Interim HealthCommission.5. The Assembly also considered the Council&apos;s Report on the EconomicReconstruction of Devastated Areas. It pressed all concerned, including Govern-ments, Specialised Agencies, and inter-Governmental Organisations to treat therestoration of the devastated areas as an urgent problem, and drew attentionto the special importance for this purpose of the early functioning of the Inter-national Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Assembly also recom-mended that the Economic and Social Council give prompt and favourable consideration to the establishment of Economic Commissions for Europe and forAsia and the Far East. This recommendation, which was approved without adissenting voice, is a noteworthy step forward, as is the fact that the Slav groupvoted for it.6. The Assembly also approved the relationship agreements with the variousSpecialised Agencies, stressing the need for close co-ordination of the work ofthe United Nations and the Specialised Agencies.7. In approving the Report of the Economic and Social Council theAssembly, despite strong opposition from both the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates and others, recommended that the Economic and Social Council give theWorld Federation of Trade Unions the right to submit questions for insertion in the provisional Agenda of the Council, thereby affording the World Federationof Trade Unions equal rights to specialised agencies, and greater rights thansovereign States who are not members of the Council. This right was extendedon the United States initiative to certain other non-governmental organisationssuch as the International Co-operative Alliance and the International Chamberof Commerce. The Soviet proposal that the World Federation of Trade Unionsshould have the right to present written and verbal statements to the council was, however, fortunately defeated.ANNEX HRefugeesThe instructions of the United Kingdom Delegation were to support theestablishment of an International Refugee Organisation provided this body wastruly international, and provided there was a satisfactory prospect of sufficientcountries joining willing and able to contribute to the operational expenditureof the organisation in such measure that the United Kingdom&apos;s share of the totalbudget would in no circumstances amount to more than 15 per cent.2. In the debates on the draft Constitution of the International RefugeeOrganisation, which had already been approved by the Economic and, social council, the Slav bloc brought forward all the amendments and allegations that had been already debated ad nauseam in the Economic and Social Council, and inthe Special Committee on Refugees and Displaced Persons. In particular, theSlav bloc wished to exclude political dissidents from the scope of the Organisationand wished to give representatives of the countries of origin a considerable measure of control over the camps where refugees and displaced persons are atpresent located. Nearly all the Slav amendments were voted down, but sufficientwere included to cause some anxiety.3. The International Refugee Organisation Constitution, together with proposals for an interim Preparatory Commission and a provisional budget forthe first year&apos;s operations, were approved. Indications are that the Slav states will not join the International Refugee Organisation.
4. For the International Refugee Organisation to come into being 15 States,whose contributions must total some 75 per cent, of the total budget, must sign the Constitution. So far only 5 or 6 States have signed. As far as His Majesty^Government are concerned, no decision has yet been taken as to signature.ANNEX united Nations HeadquartersThe wbole question of the location of the site in the United States wasreopened by the ill-advised intervention of the United States Delegation. Therewas a prospect of a close vote as between San Francisco, New York andPhiladelphia. A1 last minute solution was found, however, through the unexpectedoffer by Mr. John D. Rockefeller Jr. of a six-block site in Manhattan. This offer was accepted and the permanent headquarters of the United Nations, will, there-fore,&apos; probably consist of a skyscraper building in Central New York. this solution is generally acceptable as it means a considerable economy for the united nations and does not involve displacement of any inhabitants. It correspondswith our wish that the site of the United Nations should be in the eastern side ofthe United States.
