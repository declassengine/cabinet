Early decisions are necessary.G. A * I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W. 1.31st January,  1947-
&quot;1 *    Should the Bill contain a clause limiting- the duration ofthe National Service Acts?&apos;If the Bill does not provide for a time-limit to Beplaced on the National Service Acts its opponents in parliament will certainly table an amendment.      It might Be better to forestall this by including a time-limit in the Bill.      If thisis agreed it will Be necessary to decide what the time-limit should Be and this could not be less than five years.      Such aprovision in the Bill would mean that the Acts would expire on1st January,  195a,  unless otherwise determined by Parliament.It would be necessary to provide that the expiry of theActs should not affect the liability to whole-time or Reserveservice of men already called up under the Acts.2&apos; Ought the Services to have discretion to transfer men tothe Reserve before they have completed their full periodof whole-time service?Any widespread exceptions to the period of 18 monthswhole-time service laid down in the Bill would not only creatediscontent,  but would indicate that the period of service oughtto be reduced for everyone.      There are,  however,  certain very limited categories of men whose transfer to the Reserve Beforethe end of eighteen months appears to be justifiable and inthe national interest.      For example,  the initial training andbasic flying training of men accepted for aircraft duties can becompleted in a year and to give advance flying training would be most expensive in money and overheads (airfields,  aircrafts,instructors, maintenance staff etc.)  and of little real usesince it would not be practicable to give training on operationaltypes during service in the Air Force Reserve as distinct fromthe Auxiliary Air Force.      Further, it would not always bepossible to employ the aircrew entrants usefully,  even on groundduties,  after they have completed their flying training.      Allpersons accepted for aircrew duties will have entered into higherreserve commitments than those provided in the Bill,  and therewould, in any case be no question of transferring to the Reserve,before the completion of 18 months whole-time service, men whohad been accepted for the Auxiliary Air Force or for commissions,or men who could be profitably employed on ground duties at theend of their basic flying training.      Similar difficulties may arise in the other two Services, though probably on a smaller scale.      It is proposed,   therefore,  that the Services shouldhave discretion to transfer men to the Reserve before they have completed 18 months whole-time service.       In any case transfer&apos;v/ould not be approved before the men had served 12 months.A provision of this nature would also help the Services indealing with urgent compassionate cases which would, otherwise have to be dealt with by discharge without any reserveliability.Although the number of men prematurely transferredto the Reserve would necessarily be limited,  industry would benefit by the early return to their employment of thosetransferred.
3&quot;    Should the Services be empowered to commute &quot;reserve&quot;training in whole or part to evening and week-endtraining periods?It has already been decided that men called up underthe Bill shall be liable to 60 days full time reservetraining with a maximum of 21  in any year.      The War office have pointed out that most of the men with whom they will haveto deal will be passing into the Territorial Array,  thetraining of which includes &quot;training periods&quot; of one hour&apos;sinstruction each carried out in the evenings or at week-endcamps.      (Such periods hove hitherto been  called &quot;drills&quot;but will in future be called &quot;training periods&quot;).      Many men will have to be trained in a new arm,   and their training willbe ineffective,   if they attend annual camp without previouspart-time instruction.      In particular,  it would.not bepossible to train A. A.  units of the Territorial Army solely by periods of training in camp.      It is proposed, therefore,that the Service Departments should be empowered to commutethe full-time &quot;reserve&quot; training in whole or in part to&quot;training periods&quot;  either during evenings or at week-end camps.It is suggested that four training periods of one hour&apos;sinstruction each should be regarded as equal to one day&apos;straining.      This is by no means an onerous ratio, as in theTerritorial Army a days annual training in camp averagesappreciably more than four hours&apos; work.As a statutory provision this would not be entirelynovel.      There was provision for commutation between daystraining and :&apos;drills&quot;  in the Reserve Forces Act,  1882,  inconnection with the annual training of the Army Reserve.If a man did not attend the required number oftraining periods in any year,   it is suggested that he shouldforfeit the whole period of days which had been commuted to training periods in that year,  and be required to make good the forfeited period of days in a subsequent year.      There will-be adequate sanctions for failure to attend annual training inc am p.k.    Should there be provision for unconditional registration of conscientious objectors?The Bill contains no provision altering the existing law whereby Local and Appellate Tribunals are given power to register a conscientious&apos;objector unconditionally.      This power has existed throughout the war and has been used with greatdiscretion.      Its removal would be strongly resisted by the organisations supporting conscientious objectors and would undoubtedly lead to amendments being put down by both sides inthe House.      The Tribunals have had much experience  in dealingwith conscientious objectors and t:.ere is not the least doubtthat they are most unlikely to be deceived by plausible butinsincere argument.      If, moreover,  there were no power togrant unconditionsi registration there would be no alternative to prosecution and imprisonment of the men who refused to appear before the Tribunals or to accept their decisions.This would lead to allegations of persecution.It is estimated that,  if the existing position is leftunchanged,  the number of men who will appear before Tribunalswill be about 500 each year of whom certainly not more than HO-would be registered unconditionally.      Of the remainder about250 would be registered conditionally and the rest would either be registered for non-combatant duties or rejected.
5o    Should conditionally registered conscientious objectorsbe registered for more than 18 months?Conditionally registered conscientious objectorscannot,  in practice,  be required to perform short periods of civilian work equivalent to the reserve training of men called up which will be spread over 5^ years.      It is for consideration,therefore, whether their period of conditional registrationshould be extended beyond 18 months by the 60 days which represents the reserve liability of men called, up.Unless this obligation is imposed on conscientious objectors they will be at an advantage compared with the menwho perform military service.      If agreed the period ofconditional registration might be stated as 20 months.6-    Should the Bill impose an obligation on the Services toprovide or secure facilities for further education ofmen called up?The Defence and Services Group of the parliamentary labour Party have made representations to this effect and an amendment will, no doubt, be put down if such a provision is not included in the Bill.The Ministry of Education consider that an obligationshould be assumed under the Bill by the Services for makingor securing suitable provision for education.      Under thepresent law the duty falls on local education authorities.But in the Ministry&apos;s view it would clearly be wrong to leavelocal authorities with this duty once a National Service Acthad been passed.       It will,  therefore,  be necessary,  in anycase,  to make a  suitable amendment to the Education Act,  19hh,by a provision in the National Service Bill.&quot;      The Ministryof Education consider,  however,  that if local educationauthorities are thus relieved,  it would be indefensible thatno statutory duty should be placed on any public authority forsecuring continued education for this large section of thecommunity at a most important period of their lives.      If a clause were inserted in the Bill on the lines suggested by theMinistry of Education,  the interpretation of the term&quot;suitable provision&quot;  could be left to be determined accordingto circumstances and arrangements could, be made in any givenarea to make use of facilities provided by local educationauthorities and other bodies on suitable terms.The Service Ministers resist the proposal that theyshould be placed under any statutory obligation  in this respect.They state that every effort will be made to provide for themen called up as much general educational and vocational training as possible during their period of service and to give them no less opportunities for part-time education than theywould have if they were in civilian employment, but point outthat there will be circumstances,  e.g.  on board ship and at certain stations overseas, where facilities will necessarily be limited.&apos;    They consider that there is a danger that an indefinite obligation of the kind proposed would be likely tointerfere with the primary purpose of the National Service Schemeand that it would be difficult&quot; to withdraw from any specificobligation which might now be accepted if the period, of nationalservice were subsequently reduced with the resultantintensification of Service training.
7.    Ought theological students to be exempt from call-up?At  present a man in holy orders or a regular Ministerof.any religious denomination is exempt from liability forcall-up and it is not proposed to alter this position.      a difficult Question arises,  however,  regarding the position oftheological students.      These men will be eligible fordeferment to enable them to complete their training, but,if treated like other students,  their deferment would be terminated before they reached the upper age limit for call-up,(26)  and they would then do their period of national service.Strong representations have been received from Cardinal Griffin,the Archbishop of Westminster,   that candidates for the roman catholic priesthood who,  after severe test,  are finallyselected for ordination should not be called up at that criticalstage of their preparation for the priesthood but should beallowed to receive ordination without the interruption of 18months service in the Forces.      The Cardinal has also suggestedthat if the main purpose of compulsory national service inpeace-time is to provide trained reserves, that is   no point incompelling candidates for the ministry to undergo a period of whole-time service in view of the fact that,  when ordained,  theywill become exempt from reserve service or colling up in anemergency.      Similar representations may be expected from otherreligious bodies.On the other hand the Archbishop of Canterbury has expressed the view that, -whilst theological students like otherstudents,  should be eligible for deferment to enable them tocomplete their training for the ministry before doing their national service,  they should not,  as a class, be exempt from national service.      He would object to an arrangement under whichstudents&apos; of one denomination were compelled to serve whilstthose of another denomination escaped service.      This is,therefore,  a very difficult and controversial  question,  thoughfrom the point of view of the numbers involved it is notimportant.It would clearly be undesirable to exempt theologicalstudents as a class thus departing from the principle of universal liability.      The Roman Catholic Church appreciatethis and do not ask for statutory exemption of theologicalstudents;    in effect they ask that indefinite deferment shouldbe granted administratively in individual cases until ordinationwhen they would automatically become exempt.To adopt this method would be, without exemptingtheological students in the Bill, nevertheless to give themexemption In effect by granting indefinite administrativedeferment.      Under such a method it would be open to the Churcheseither to apply for the indefinite deferment of their candidatesor to take no steps to prevent their being called up in thenormal way.      One point in favour of a solution on these linesis that the men in Question are in training for an occupation in  respect of which exemption is specifically provided in theNational Service Acts.      I favour this method,  but I must saythat this is a matter bound to give rise to much controversyfor there are obvious objections to a  system of exempting thesestudents by administrative action when no specific provisionfor such exemption is made in the Bill.
