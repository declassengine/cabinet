(4,7)  2619TH J^rTTJARYo 194 VCABINETSOCIALISATION OF THE GERMAN Ba8IC industries memorandum by the chancellor of:the DuchyINTENTION1.     At the Meeting of the Cabinet held on 19th November, 19h7,( CM. (lf.6)98th Conclusions, Minute 3) it was agreed that asa first step German custodians should be appointed who would hold the custody of the assets of the principal industries of the Ruhr.      These industries have been previously defined as coal, iron1, and steel, heavy engineering and chemicals.&quot;At the Meeting of the Cabinet held on 12th Dec-ember,  1946(C.M.(ii6) 105th Conclusions, Minute 2.) it was pointed outthat while the Cabinet had approved the proposals for the socialisation of the principal industries within theNorth Rhine Westphalia Land there were arguments in favourof socialising these industries throughout the British zone of Germany,      It was decided that further proposals on thispoint should be submitted to the Cabinet  in due course.These proposals, which are outlined below, are relatedsolely to the geographical scope of socialisation withoutperjudice to the final decision whether ultimate ownershipshould be vested in the Land Government or in a wider&apos;administration.      The following factual information regardingthe geographical disposition of the industries in questionis relevant: -Coal        There awe only two small mining areasoutside the-Land North Rhine Westphalia andtheir combined production amounts to lessthan 2 million tons a year.Iron and When the mag or steel producing plants whichSteol&quot;.&apos;&quot;    are to be thrown up for reparations havebeen removed, of the remainder approximately80;o  will be situated in the Land NorthRhine Westphalia,     The residue Is distributedgenerally throughout Lower SaxcQSSs in which,province is also situated the majority ofthe iron ore mines.
131Heavy Engineering and Chemicals.     Although the heaviestconcentration of the&quot;engineering and chemical industries is found in North Rhine Westphaliathese industries;, for the most part, aredistributed throughout the British ZoneMoreover, on account of the extensive rangecovered by these industries socialisation isconsidered to be a practical step only in thecase of selected undertakings.Although it has been considered desirabto carry out a policy of socialisationit is necessary to ensure that questionobscure or confuse the economic, politireasons v/hich underly our general advocin Germany* For these reasons it is nlogical or equitable to deny the benefito German industry in general by confinregion,, Consequently it is recominendefor socialisation should be as follows:le for security reasons of these industries,s of security do notcal and psychologicalacy of socialisationot thought to bets of socialisationing the plan to oned that the programme(a) Coal,     All coal interests throughout the British Zone(b) Iron and Steel.    The iron and steel producing&quot; undertakings, within the permitted level,throughout the British Zone.(c) Heavy Engineering and Chemicals.   Selected undertakings^       in the British Zone.In the case of heavy engineering and chemical industries itwill be necessars^ as a first step for the C omiriander-in-Chiefto take into his control the. selected undertakings, andin making the selection it is considered desirable to obtainGerman technical advice.proposals. (   The proposals are divided into two phases:-PHASE I       The selection and appointment of Germancustodians.     In the case of the Heavy engineering and. Chemical industries after assumption of control by the Commander-in-Chief and definition of the units to be included in the plan.PHASE II     The appointment    of German Interim AdvisoryCommittees,CUSTODIANS3&quot;      (a) Responsibilities,      Since the object of selectingthe custodians as an initial measure of socialisation is primarily     of psychological and political significanceit is proposed that the selections should be made on apolitical rather than a functional basis.     The object of appointing custodians is primarily to make it clear that theindustries in question would in due course be owned by theGermans themselves and representatives selected for these duties should be persons who would eta!joy the confidence ofthe German people.      Their powers necessarily would belimited.      Title would not pass to them but they would have
the right to ask for information on all aspects of theparticular industry to which they have been appointed andv/ould be expected to provide a source of consultation and advice to Military Government.(c ) Sel 5.ii2Ili     Following the principles outlined above and after consultation with the Land Governments inconformity with the agreement arising out of the Meetingof the Cabinet held on 19th November 1946 (C.M,(li6)98th Conclusions, Minute 3) recommendations have been madeon a scale of 3 custodians per industry to include as faras possible 1  representative each from S.P.D., CD.IT-  andthe appropriate Trade Union,      Recommendations for actualappointments are attached at Appendix A.(G) An 2i iB2il!L!     German custodians to the coal andiron and steel industries would be appointed immediately0A draft of an Ordinance appointing them,, which has beensubmitted for consideration by the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Officers of the Crown, is attached at Appendix BoAt the moment of presentation of this paper they have Gotadvised, whether the use of the terms &quot;Custody&quot; and&quot;Custodian&quot; &amp;s&amp; a legal instrument such as an Ordinancewould or would not lead to legal difficulty in view of the restricted functions which it is intended that the Custodiansshould exercise.      If the ordinance is not approved by theLord Chancellor and Law Officers of the Crown it would benecessary to appoint the custodians by administrative action and to make the announcement of their appointment to theGerman people by proclamation,      I shall, of course, boguided by their advice.In      (a) Formation.      German Interim Advisory committees would be set up through consultation with the appropriatecustodians.      The principle on which these Committees wouldbe formed will be as follows;-Independent nomination prefer-ablywith financial qualificat ions.Drawn from the industry the 2 Trade Union representatives&apos;would be appointed in consultationwith cither the appropriateindustrial union or the ZonalTrijade Union organization orb oth.The Advisory Committees will derive their authority from,and at the discretion of, the British Ofntrol Staffsappointed to each industry.      Initially these committees will be advisory in character, and executive powers in management and production would be transferred only as.this appeared to be expedient in the interests of efficiency and in conformity with our general policy.ChairmanDeputy Chairman )and 3 members )2 Trade Union Reps.
193(b) Appointment *      It is recommended that a formalannouncement should&quot;&quot;be made by the Coramander-in-Ohief torepreschtatiyes of the Land Governments immediately prior tothe announcement of the names of the German custodiansselected for the coal and iron and steel industries.     Theannouncement would be followed by a release to the press, acopy of which would be handed to the U.S. Element immediately before the press release.     A draft is at Appendix C0TIMIHG5,      (a) The appropriate announcement and the appointmentof custodians to the coal and iron and steel industries would be made immediately following approval of this paper,(b) In consultation with the custodians, the formationof Interim Advisory Committees for the coal and iron andsteel Industries.     As the custodians will have been appointedafter consultation with the Land Governments and will represent the main political view points thes? would beregarded as comprising authoritative and sufficient sources of German advice for this purpose.60      It has been agreed that we should go forward with our policy of socialisation regardless of American reactions.Ministers, however, will be aware of the statement made byGeneral Clay to the effect that objections would he raised toour policy unless it were manifestly the will of the germans themselves.      Since the German Land Governments will no doubtmake some form of declaration on the announcement of these measures by the Oornmander-in-Ghief, we have made informal soundings as to what these reactions are likely to be and itseems clear that even in North Rhine/Westphalia the GermanLand authorities will certainly endorse our action by amajority or may even anticipate us by a demand for implementation of the policy already announced.     We do notthereforer in any event, anticipate any difficulty with theUnited States Element which might otherwise have embarrassed,even temporarily, the bi-zonal arrangement.RECO^mTDATiaPTS7o      I seek the endorsement  of my colleagues to thefollowing proposals:-(a) The programme of socialisation shall cover initiallythe four industries, namely, coal,iron and steel,heavy engineering and chemicals, throughout theBritish Zone;(b) Custodians shall be appointed to represent theInterest of the German people in these industriespending transfer to public ownership in whatever formmay. b e fin ally agr e e d.(c) Interim German advisory committees shall be established in the case of the coal and iron and steelIndustrie s*

italy 0AFPF DJX__ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE MADE BY THE COM! AJ.IDER-IN-GHIEPTO THE LAND GOVERNMENTS ON THE APPOINTMENT OPCUSTODIANS TO THE COAL AND.IRON AND STEEL industries in THE BRITISH ZONE.1 .     I have corn&apos;e here to talk with you about the plans forthe reorganisation of the German coal and iron and steel industries and to inform you of the steps which my Governmenthas now decided to take in that connection,      I am aware thatthere has been some uncertainty in the minds of the Germanpeople on this subject and I am confident that the measuresabout to be taken will assist materially in removing thisuncertainty and thus get rid of what may be a psychologicalobstacle to the production of those basic materials which are so essential to the proper functioning of German and european industrial economy.2.     As you are aware,  in my capacity as Commander-in-chief and Military Governor of the* British Zone, I have taken intomy control at different times the coal industry and iron andsteel industry throughout the British Zone.      In taking thesesteps I have always made it  clear that the undertakingsinvolved would never be returned to their original Germanowners, or to the control of those who have so tragicallymisused their powers in the past. -3.      The time has now come when my Government wishes to takea further step towards the final solution of this importantproblem, which,  in their view, as has Already been announced, lies in public ownership.     I am here to-day to acquaint you of this next step.    It is ray governments intention to appoint to the coal and iron and steelindustrie a in the Br 11 ish Zone , German cust odia-is on thebasis of three such custodians to each of the industries in question.     After consultation with prominent membersof the Land Governments my Government is selecting the names of 6 German custodians for these important duties.     Thesecustodians will provide to Military Government a source of advice and consultation which will be of great value inj?-osolving this coniploa and vital task.     The names of theseGerman custodians will be announced shortly.h.      It is perhaps unnecessary that I should point out,but desirable in order to avoid any misunderstanding, thatthe assumption of custody by German nominations will in no way modify the rights and obligations which the Allies have assumed under the Potsdam Agreement.      It should also benoted that the responsibilities of custodians will be confined to the custody of the assets of the two industries concerned.      Their arrpointinent will not affect, for thetime being, the ownership of title or existing rights orliabilities in the undertakings concerned.5,      In consultation with the German custodians so appointed,it is the intention to form Interim Advisory Committees foreach cf the two industries, such Committees including experts in each particular industrial field, and also re pre sen &quot;cat ionfrom t&amp;e Trade Unions,
2016. Tho appointment of custodians and the subsequentestablishment  of Interim Advisory Committees will not of itself determine the question of the ultimate ownership ofthese industries, and many problems remain to be solvedbefore the final pattern for these basic industriesemerges.     For example, there are the  questions of eventualcompensation, of the value of the fixed assets, of theclaims of financial and other interests, and of the final form and structure of the industries.7.     The task is an immense one and will call for great efforts and close and willing co-operation.      In addition should be recognised that the appointment of custodiansto these vitally important German industries represents agreat step forward.      It should provide the German people and the workers in those industries with that assurancewhich they have felt in need of and which I am confidentwill act as a spur and a stimulas to increased production,the securing of Which will do more than any other one thing to put German industry on its feet and to restore a higher standard of life for the German people.
