January 1947Copy No,CABINETSECRETCP. (47) 73rd January, 1947MINISTERIAL BROADCASTSNote by the Prime minister in paragraph 34 of OP. (46) 199 &quot; Questions of Procedure for Ministers &quot; I pointed out that broadcasts by Ministers may be regarded by the B.B.C.or by the Opposition as controversial and therefore as giving a claim to a reply.I therefore asked that all Ministers intending to broadcast should communicate with the Postmaster-General who would be responsible for obtaining my approval in all cases.2. During the present Parliament up to the end of October there havebeen 47 broadcasts (including one or two not broadcast to this country) by ministers, as compared with two by the Opposition on the Budget. Whilethe Leader of the Opposition has not made any special claim, he said in recentdiscussion that he tools: note of the figures and wished to be supplied withparticulars of the broadcasts.3. I shall in the near future be circulating a memorandum about theagreement reached with the Opposition and the B.B.C. about political broadcasts.4. In the meantime, however, I must ask Ministers to co-operate with mein reducing the number of Ministerial broadcasts on Home programmes. If, broadcasts by Ministers occur too frequently, the result can only be to debasetheir value and reduce their effectiveness when they are really necessary. Ishall in future require in each case to be satisfied that the possibility of arranging for an officer of the Department to broadcast, and, indeed, the question whethera special broadcast is really necessary, should have been carefully considered beforethe request for a Minister to broadcast is met, and I shall feel bound to withholdconsent except where I am satisfied that it is important that a special broadcastshall be arranged and that the advantages of a broadcast by a Minister overthe alternatives of a broadcast by an official or reliance upon the B.B.C. to giveadequate publicity are substantial. This will make it necessary for me to benformed in good time of any proposed Ministerial broadcast.
25. In the expectation that the number of such Ministerial broadcasts willbe decreased substantially as a result of the above, I propose that the B.B.C,should be asked to give special consideration to any requests for a full treatmentof announcements which, but for these arrangements, the Minister concerned would have thought of sufficient importance to justify a Ministerial broadcast.I will inform Ministers in due course of the result of this approach to the B.B.C.,but here also a sense of proportion will have to be maintained and care takento keep the number of such requests to the minimum.6. I shall be glad if Ministers will bring this to the notice of junior ministers in their Departments.C. E. A.-10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1947.
