At their meeting of 16th January (CM. (47)  8thConclusions) the Cabinet invited me to prepare,  in the lightof the discussion,  a memorandum giving full information aboutthe effect of a scheme for the direction of women on the lines proposed in the memorandum of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Planning.      I attach a memorandum by my Departmentgivingthis information.20       &apos;       The total supply of women tnat would be produced forthe undermanned industries and. services depends to a considerable extent on the industries and services that will not be calledupon to give up any of their women.      On the assumption thatmarried women would be completely exempt from direction and thatthe industries and services in paragraph. 6(i),   (ii) and (iii)would not be called upon to give up their women,  it is estimatedthat the supply of add.initio.nal women for the undermannedindustries and services by the end of 194745,000 rising to 67,000 or 90,000 by theto whether the service was for a period2 years.might amount to: end of 1948 accordingof 18 months or of3o Theund-ermanned. 1the age of 18being disturbindustries frlike-wise attrto make anyattracted tofact that women were being directed to thendustries would, automatically cause women belowto go into those industries in order to avoided on reaching the age of 20om which women were notact a ddi t i on a 1 worn en.at the same time thebeing withdrawnIt is,  however,wouldnot possibleestimate as to the additional numbers that would bethe undermanned industries in this way.G.

ANNEXECONOMIC SURVEY FOB 191-1-7EMPLOYMENT OF WOMENMemorandum by the Ministry of Labour and National service the proposal of tire Ministerial Committee on Economic&quot;Planning was that for a limited period women,  on reaching the age of 20,  should undertake a period of national service which might be for two years.      It was not suggested that women should be conscripted into the Services, but that they shouldbe called upon to undertake a  period of service in one of theoccupations of national importance in which there is an acute shortage    of labour,  such as the textile industries,  theWomen * s Land Army, nursing and domestic service in hospitals and similar institutions.2o In preparing the following estimates,  it has been assumed:-(i) that if a scheme were introduced In 1947 it would apply to all women who reached the age of 20 in the current year,  including those who had passed their 20th birthday atthe time of the introduction of the scheme.      The figures given below relate to&apos; the number of women who will have reachedage 20 between 1st January and 31st December,  1947.(ii) that married women would be completely exempt fromdirection.      The figures given below thus relate only tosingle women.3. The total number of single women aged 20 in GreatBritain at the end of 1947 is estimated at 250,000 and thefollowing figures give a broad analysis of this total:-Insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act(including those insured, under special schemes)Number occupied in industry who are excepted, fromunemployment insurance (nurses,  teachers,  civilservants,  self-employed and farmers&apos;  daughtersemployed in agriculture)Women 1s Auxiliary ServicesStudentsPrivate domestic servants,, those in charge of households,  and the unoccupied194,00020,00015,0005,00016,000Total 250,000It is clear from the foregoing analysis that thenumber of single women 20 years of age who are now undertakingno work, of any kind is negligible.-1-
0&quot;h.. Women to be directed into occupations of national importance will thus have to be transferred from some other employment,  and in view of the analysis given in the precedinparagraph It is clear that they would hove to be found from among the 19h,000 women insured under the Employment insurance acts,  and within that total from non-productive occupationsor from productive industries in which it is d.esired to restrict the numbers employed.5. The industrial analysis of the 19U,000 single womenaged. 20 is as follows: -National and Local Government Service,Commerce, Banking,  Insurance and finance 2d,000professional and Personal Services 8,500Entertainment and Sport 3,000Catering Trades 6,000Distributive Trades 3d,000Transport and Public Utilities 7,500Building and Civil Engineering,Agriculture, Pishing and. Mining 10,500Metals, Engineering and Chemicals 1+2,000Pood, Drink and Tobacco 9,000Miscellaneous Manufactures 7,000Undermanned In dustriesTextiles 15,000)Clothing -   11,500)Footwear 3,000)Furniture 1,000^Paper and Printing 6,000)Laundries and Cleaning       6,000 )U2,500Total        19d,000
6,    (i)       The main non-productive occupations are national and Local Government service, commerce, hanking,  insurance and finance, professional and personal services,  entertainment andsport,  the distributive trades and the catering industry.      the productive industries in which it is desired to limit the-numbers employed are the&apos; engineering and metal industries (seeparagraph 36 of C.P. (47) 25 and Conclusion 11 of CM. (47) 9thConelusions).(ii)    It is extremely doubtful if any young women could betransferred from National or Local Government service.      inthe Civil Service they &quot;are very largely employed as shorthandwriters and typists and tabulating machine operators,telephonists and telegraphists.      It is highly important thatthe numbers so employed should be.maintained and there is alarge unsatisfied demand.      The same is prohvbly true ofLocal Government service;     (only about 7,000 in all are in this latter employment) and also of commerce, banking,  insurance and finance, where 4,000 are at present employed.(iii)    It  is probably undesirable to transfer women fromtransport and utilities, building and civil engineering,agriculture, fishing and mining,  or from the food,  drink and tobacco and miscellaneous manufacturing industries which include building materials.(iv)    This leaves for consideration the metal,  engineering and chemical industries,  the distributive trades,  catering,professional and personal services,  entertainment and sport.The total number of single women aged 20 now employed in those industries and services is about 93,500.7. Textiles,  clothing, footwear, furniture, paper and printing and laundries now employ about 42,500 single womenaged 20.      The total number of men and women employed in theseundermanned industries at November,   1946, was 2,070,000.This was  552,000 less than the corresponding number at mid-&apos;1939, but  the real demand is probably appreciably less.When,  however,  the Women&apos;s Land Army, Nursing and domestic service in hospitals and similar institutions are taken intoaccount,  it is probably safe to say that the group taken as awhole require something like 500,000 additional workers.8. If it  is desirable to avoid altogether,  or reduce to a minimum,  the transference of young women from their homeareas,  it is necessary to consider the geographical distributionof the undermanned industries and the extent to which -young -women are&apos; employed in the same areas in the less essential industries and services referred to above in paragraph 6 -(iv).Such a comparison can only at.present be made for each Regiontaken as a whole,  as figures are not readily available on this basis for smaller areas.      It is probable, however,  that evenif the problem could be studied in greater detail than is nowpossible,  the conclusion reached would not be very different.9. Nearly 80 per cent,   of employment  in textiles,clothing, footwear, furniture,  paper and printing and laundriesis concentrated in five Regions, namely, London, NorthMidlands, East and West Ridings, North Western and Scotland,and it is probable that the deficiency in these five Regionscompared with mid-1939 is of the order of 400,000.      Theestimated total number of single women aged 20 now employed inthese five Regions in the industries and services mentionedin paragraph 6 (iv) above is about 53,000,
9 Q1Clearly only a proportion of these young women could he wOltransferred and it seems unlikely that the net gain to the&quot;undermanned industries in these Regions would exceed, say,25 000 in 1947.      If the period, of service were fixed at two years this numher might he doubled by the end of 1948,but if it were fixed at 18 months the numher at the end of1948 might be about -37,000.10. Ia the other six Regions the deficiencies in theundermanned, industries probably amount to at least 100,000including the Women&apos;s Land -Army, Nursing,    and. domestic service in hospitals and similar institutions.      In these Regions thereare about 40,000 young women aged 20 employed in the industries and services mentioned in paragraph 6 (iv) above and probably not more than 20,000 could be transferred from their presentemployments.      There seems no doubt that s;ich a number couldbe readily absorbed in the undermanned industries and services which their own Regions without requiring any large numbers to leave home.      On this basis the total supply for the under-manned industries and. services by the end of 1947 might amountto 45,000, rising to 67,000 or 90,000 by the end of 1948.11. If it were decided that transfers should be made only to the textile industries - at any rate in the firstinstance - the numbers that could, be  transferred would be much smaller.      The textile industries are mainly concentrated in three or four Regions and consequently much larger numbers of young women would have to leave home for employment in these industries.      This would give &quot;ise to problems of accommodationas well as additional personal hardship.Even an extended list of employments to he mannedup would involve some transfers from home areas and it wouldbe necessary for the Government to continue the practice of paying travelling expenses and. lodging allowances to thosetransferred.12. There seems little doubt that in a period of 18 months or two years the young women transferred would, acquire sufficientskill to make them a useful addition to the labour force ofthe industries and services into which- they might be directed.13.    Women in the Armed ForcesIt is estimated that the following numbers of womenwill be serving in the Armed Forces at 31st December,  1947;-Royal Navy 9,850Army 27,000Royal Air Force    26.000Total:        62.850In the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force the above figures represent the maximum numbers which can be employed, in&apos;substitution for men,  having regard to the degree of dilutionalready achieved in trades to which they are suited and other factors such as the existence of suitable accommodation.      Inthe Army it might he possible to absorb an additional 8,000,subject to the proviso that volunteers are forthcoming in timeto be trained for the trades in which they can be employed.
