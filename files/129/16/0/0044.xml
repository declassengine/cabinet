Jr.   304(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)setting C R E Tc.p.(hi) hh29th January^ J9h7CABINETINTERNATIONAL TRADE organisation memorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues may remember that on the 28th november last at the conclusion of the first session in London of thePreparatory Committee for a United Nations Conference on Tradeand Employment,  I arranged to make a brief statement in replyto a Question in the House of Commons.      Definite plans forthe next stage in these discussions have now been worked out,involving a second session of the Committee at Geneva inApril,  preceded in our case by a British Commonwealth meetinghere in March.I think that the  time has come therefore when afurther statement would be desirable.      If, however,  I arrangefor another Question and answer there may well be a demandfor a debate on the subject.      On the whole I am inclined to feel that this would serve a useful purpose.      As a resultof the forthcoming international discussions we shall haveto be prepared to enter into definite commitments.      Not only,therefore, would a debate provide an opportunity for informingParliament of the plans and timetable to which we are workingbut it would strengthen the Government&apos;s position when it came to commitments since we should be able to say that before sending our Delegation to Geneva we had been fortifiedby the views of the House of Commons as a whole. ,The difficulty is of course that of parliamentary time.      In any case there may be Questions and there may bea demand for a debate,  but before taking any action which maylead to demands for a debate I felt that I should seek theview of my colleagues.R. S. C.Board of Trade,Millbank, S.W.1.COPY NO.  r29th January,  1947.
