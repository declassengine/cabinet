I! * 4a%&amp;t&quot;XS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRETmmCP, (47)  17 COPY NOJ6TH  JANUARY,  1947.CABINETGOAL AND ELECTRICITYMe do rand up by the Lord President of the council,      I am gravely concerned,  as I am sure that all my colleagues are, about the repercussions of the fuel supply position on our economic prospects in the next few years;    and I think that thememorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power  (CP. (47)  6)  affordsa suitable opportunity for considering some of the general issues involved.Long Term Plans2.      It is difficult to see how industry generally is to be induced to become more efficient and to form long-term plans when there is such a cramping shortage of coal, electricity and gasand when Covernment-policy in respect of supplies of fuel iscoloured by short-term difficulties,3.      The Economic Survey for 1947, which will shortly be comingbefore the Cabinet, shows  that there is a serious danger of alarge deficit between internal requirements and available supplies in the coal year 1947-48.      Moreover , stocks must be&apos; built up toa really satisfactory level;    and the domestic consumer shouldbe assured of a more normal level of fuel supplies.      Further, itis not really enough simply to meet our internal requirements.Before the war exports of coal amounted to over 40,000,000 tons ayear and their resumption on a considerable scale would enable usto get supplies of commodities of which we ore desperately short,such as timber, and would place us  in a strong bargaining position in getting other necessary imports.      The hand .of - theForeign Secretary would also bo much strengthened.4.      It is intolerable that we should be thinking in terms ofdeficiencies, even in respect of the next coal year.      &quot;We oughtto set ourselves the task of securing an output of coal which winmeet requirements;    and we should examine, in the &quot;1940&quot;  spiritthat all obstacles must be overcome,  the measures which arenecessary for this purpose.      These measures should include an incentive wage structure for mineworkers, special priority for miners in the provision of houses,  the immediate employment ofall suitable prd.es, and  the temporary use of other foreign labour which can be sent back when our immediate difficulties are over.If necessary, we should import coal this year.5.      I suggest  that the Cabinet shculd ask the Coal Committee tomake, without delay, a review/ of the estimated supply and require-raents of coal over the. next three coal years and to examine thevarious measures to increase production, as part of a consideredplan for  these years.6S      In respect of electricity generation,  the Minister of fuel and Power refers to an estimated deficiency of 1.8 million kilo-,watts as late as 1949.      Must we think in terms of restrictingdemand even in 1949?.    I suggest that the Minister of Fuel and power and the Minister of Supply should examine, as a matter of urgency,  the measures which can be taken to increase the effect-ive capacity of the  electricity  system, including a speed-up inthe production of new generating plant.      Serious delays in the delivery of plant seem to be taking place.
This Winter7. Nrne of these long-tern schemes con save us from the deficitnow upon us.8,      There seem to be two separate issues(a) What should be the basis of systematic cuts in fuel supplies, and(b) What should be clone about the serious extent to whichthe demand for electricity is exceeding supply, withthe resultant  threat that  there may be a complete dis-location of electricity supply over wide areas.9.      In regard to the first of these questions I suggest that weshould stick to the scheme governing fuel supplies for industry which was agreed with the If..P. A. C I.    It has the great advantageof providing a selective approach to industrial deliveries basedon essentiality of the industry, and yet agreed with industry. Iam convinced that we must maintain the principle of providingunimpaired, supolies of fuel to certain vital industries, and leaving any    cuts to fall on the rest of industry.The scheme was designed to enable any degree of cut to be imposed;    and it would : bv iously be desirable,  in view of theheavy cuts that are in prospect,   to keep industry continuouslyinformed of the prosper:- bs of deliveries over the next few months.10.      In any event,  there would be the gravest political objectionto making any change in the&apos; scheme of distributing fuel supplies to industry which was communicated to firms as recently as lastmonth.      There ore no new factors which would  justify a funda-mental alteration.11.      The scheme did no t,  however, provide an effective restraint on increased consumption of electricity consequent upon  the short-age of coal,     No doubt in some cases firms have transferred toether uses coal which they would otherwise have used in the gen-era tInn of electricity on their awn premises and have added tothe demand -n the public supply.      In my view,  the Minister of fuel and power&apos;s paper does not bring out sufficiently the extentto which the increased use of electricity beyond  the carefulestimates prepared by the Central Electricity Board has been dueto restrictions in coal supply which have driven consumers to theuse of more electricity.12.      If I am right in the diagnosis -of the position set out inthe preceding paragraph, it would be fatal to adopt the deviceof restricting- industrial users of coal still further in order  togive more to  the power stations,  since the only result would beto increase still further the pressure on the use of electricity and the resultant danger of widespread dislocation of supply,13.      It would seem to follow that some system must be devised toreduce electricity consumption forthwith.      The Minister of fuel and Power suggests the rationing of industrial consumers bu t I doubt whether an effective scheme could be enforced in time toavoid a chaotic breakdown in supplies.      In.these circumstances,shruld we not  consider such a radical measure as the impositionof a penal flat rate surcharge on consumption by industrial and domestic consumers in excess of consumption in a suitable basep er i od ?14.      I feel doubtful whether any restriction on the supply andinstallation of appliances would make any material contributionto the problem of the next three months, but a heavy purchase tax on domestic appliances might be useful as a means -of assist-ing in restricting the demand for electricity during the nextcrucial period.H.
