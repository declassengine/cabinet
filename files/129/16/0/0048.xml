MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E ORE Tp.P. (247) US3JST JANUARY. 1947CABINETTRANSFER OF NON-ITALIAN REFUGEES IN ITALY AND NON-GERMAN3EPUGEEg IN ;JJSTRIA TO NORTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreirm AffairsThe authority of the Cabinet is sought in support of thefollowing courses of action, which are designed to meet thesituation of displaced persons in Italy on the withdrawal of theAllied Forces and in the British zone of Austria before and afterthe conclusion of an Austrian Treaty--(a) That the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugeesbe asked to undertake the protection and, ifpossible, the care and maintenance of these refugees now in Italy pending their resettlementby the Intergovernmental Committee or theInternational Refugee Organisation or their return to their countries of origin.(b) That as many as possible of these refugees whosepersonal safety would be endangered by forciblerepatriation be transferred temporarily to the camps in North Africa which have recently become available as a result of the repatriation of german prisoners of war.      They are not likely to have toremain there for an excessively long period since it is thought that this year will see the beginningof large-scale immigration, esepcially into Latin. jner i ca.(c) That the Intergovernmental Committee on Refup:eesshould also be asked to undertake the formalprotection and, if possible, the care and maintenanceof those non-German refugees at present in theBritish Zone of Austria, pending their resettlementby the Intergovernmental Committee or the   &apos;International Refugee Organisation or their returnto their countries of origin.(d) That the bulk of these refugees now in the british zone of Austria should be transferred temporarilyto North Africa, in the same way as is proposed forthe non-Italian refugees in Italy,ITALY I   -2. The question of the disposal of non-Italian refugees in italy (other than genuine war-criminals, traitors and quislings,whom, we are in any case arranging to hand over)  formed thesubject of my memorandum CP. (1.6)    2Oh of 23rd&apos;May, 1946, andhas become particularly urgent now that the Peace Treaty with italy is to be signed on 16th February and. may be expected toenter into force about 1st April.COPY NO. ^2^i
3, Since the Cabinet meeting of 30th May, 1946, at whichthe.above Memorandum was considered, the Foreign Office havebeen able to obtain a clearer idea of the serious consequencethat are likely to result if these refugees are allowed toremain in Italy as a purely Italian responsibility.      UnderArticle 45 of the Italian Peace Treaty the Italian Governmentis bound to hand over on demand any Allied nationals accused of being war criminals or traitors.      This is likely to involve&apos; the forcible surrender to the Yugoslav and otherGovernments of large numbers of innocent political refugeeseven if they have passed the screening tests which we arenow instituting.      Moreover the Italian Government havealready informed His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Rome that they want all refugees and displaced - persons removed from Italyat the earliest possible moment.      They have also indicated that they will not provide any assistance in the way of food,clothing or shelter for refugees who have so far been maintained by the Allies.4. If, therefore, the disposal of the refugee questionis left to the Italians, the following serious consequencesare likely to result:-(a) If innocent refugees are handed over by theItalians to a harsh fate at the hands of theirpolitice.1 opxjonents, there is likely to be aconsiderable public outcry, especiall;/ sinceLord Beveridge and others have given constantwarnings in Parliament and in the press as tothis possibility.(b) The withdrawal of supplies and the prospect offorcible repatriation are likely to force the refugees to take desperate measures and it ispossible that they may resort to large-scalebanditry.      Among them are some 12,000 Chetniksexperienced in guerilla warfare, as well as anumber of other ex-service personnel.      their operations may well be on so largo a scale as tomake it difficult for the Italian Government tomaintain internal security and there would be aserious danger of their being used as a catspawby the anti-communist Right which might provokereprisals by the communist Left.      Such civildisturbances could only aggravate the alreadyunstable political and economic position ofItaly and might seriously affect British interestnot only in that country but also in the wholeMediterranean area.(c) There is also the danger of frontier incidentswith Yugoslavia, which might have far-reachingc on s e quenc e a.7/ithout some modification of the Cabinet decision ofj 30th May, 1946, it is extremely doubtful whether the proposalset out in the first paragraph of this memorandum can bej  implemented.      It is assumed that it was not the intention ofI the Cabinet decision to place innocent refugees in Italy,! whether they are in fact an international or a British&apos; responsibility, in a worse position than they are in other countries.      I should be grateful if the Cabinet would nowconfirm that this assumption is correct and would approve/  the above proposals.
AUSTRIA6. The most urgent ground on which it is desired totransfer those non-German Displaced Persons new in the british zone of Austria is that the continued presence- in Austria oflarge numbers of Displaced Persons may, owing to Russianopposition, indefinitely delay the conclusion of an Austrian treaty.      Because of the desire of the British Government to conclude a Treaty with Austria at the earliest possible moment, every effort has been made to induce the control commission in Germany to agree to the transfer of those of theseDisplaced Persons who are not war criminals from Austria tothe British Zone of Germany.&quot;     Owing, however,, to the cogentreasons adduced by the British Element of the control commission, it has finally, though reluctantly, been decidedthat the proposed transfer of these Displaced Persons from austria to Germany is impracticable and unite sir able.      Itcould only be brought about by the further wholesale evictionof Germans, Which neither the Control Commission (british element), the Control Office nor the Foreign Office areprepared, in the present circumstances, to contemplate.      Itis therefore necessary, in order to remove from the Russiansthis convenient pretext for holding up an Austrian Treaty, tofind some place other than Germany to which we can transferthese Displaced Persons forthwith.7. Moreover, if agreement on the Treaty should be reached,notwithstanding our failure to secure the immediate removal ofthese Displaced Persons from Austria, there are other strong arguments in favour of their being transferred from thatcountry, in the grounds that their continued presence thereis both economically and politically undesirable.      It is most problematical whether Austria would be in a position tosupport the very heavy economic&apos; burden which the care andmaintenance of these Displaced Persons would impose.Furthermore, there is little indication at -present that anysave a small number of these Displaced Persons will of theirown accord desire to be assimilated in the Austrian economy.They are likely, therefore, if they are not transferred from austria, to remain a restless and discontented minority inthat country.      They would represent an internal securityproblem of a magnitude which the Austrian Government is not,and is not likely to be, equipped, to deal with.      The austrian government has., moreover, as a result of pressure fromourselves and other Allies agreed to accept for permanent residence and eventual naturalisation a considerable numberof Germans now in the country &quot;whose traditional ties are withAustria rather than with Germany.      (These Germans areVolkdeutsc-.be  (German minorities) who, in consequence of thewar, have, been expelled from the countries of Eastern andSouth Eastern Europe.      Some of these are due to be transferredto Germany under Potsdam.      No provision, however, has been ,made for the disposal of others).      It would seem unreasonablyin these circumstances to ask the Austrians to accept responsibility for the additional burden which the non-German displaced persons constitute, -8. Ah- even more important consideration in favour of theremoval of those Displaced Persons in Austria for whom we areat the moment responsible is that their presence in thatcountry would, after the conclusion of a Treaty, most certainly be used by the Slav Powers, in particular Yugoslavia,as a reason for bringing heavy pressure to bear on the austrian government in the form of a demand for their forciblesurrender.      It is doubtful whether the Austrian Government,any more than the Italian Government, would be in a positionto resist such pressure.      It has been suggested that this
threat of large-scale forcible deportations could be wardedoff by the insertion in the Austrian Treaty of a clauseguaranteeing the right of asylum to those Displaced persons at present in Austria.       J.t hough this is certainlydesirable it seems unlikely that we could secure Russianagreement to the insertion of any such clause.9, I should therefore be grateful, for the reasonsstated in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 above&apos;, if the Cabinet would approve&apos; the proposals  in (a) to (d) in paragraph 1.3.B.oreign Office, S.W.1,31 ST JANUARY&apos; j; 1947.
