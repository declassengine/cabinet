PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1947SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 4328th January, 1947CABINETPUBLICITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHITE PAPERSMemorandum by the Prime minister shall be glad if Ministers will impress upon their Departments the needfor exercising- the greatest care in order to avoid any possibility of an infringe-fflent of Parliamentary Privilege when publicity arrangements are made for white Papers.The normal and accepted practice is for final revised proof copies of white papers to be made available to Lobby Correspondents some hours in advanceof their being laid in the Vote Office and for Ministers to hold a Lobby Con-ference if they think it desirable. There is no objection to this. It is indeeddesirable that newspapers should be given time in this way to prepare their reports.Danger arises where advance publicity arrangements go beyond this well-established practice and include, as has been the case in one or two instances5 recently, a general Press Conference attended by others than Lobby Correspon-dents and including not only British but Foreign Press.   Such widespreaddistribution of White Papers in advance of their being laid in the Vote OfficeS might well be held by Parliament to be a breach of privilege.   Ministers should,I therefore, instruct their officials that advance distribution of White Papersj should in all cases be restricted to accredited Lobby Correspondents.C. R. A.10, downing  Street, S.W. 1,28th January, 1947.
