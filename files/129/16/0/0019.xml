The purpose of this series of Surveys is to set out, in broad terms, theeconomic information, on the basis of which Ministers can consider the futureuse of the country&apos;s resources.[32823] B
, 2. The previous Survey (M.E.P. (46) 5) related to the financial year 1946-47,and was considered by Ministers in July last (L.P. (46) 28th Meeting). Inaccordance with the decision of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Planning(M.E.P. (46) 6th Meeting), the present Survey relates to the calendar year 1947.Section II of the Survey examines the total resources likely to be available in 1947,and, in broad outline, the demands which may be made on those resources. Itreveals the existence of a wide &quot; inflationary &quot; gap when the pressure of potentialconsumers&apos; demand is taken into account. Section III considers the variouslines on which total demand might be brought into conformity with total resources.Section IV examines the specific difficulties in the way of adjusting supplies to match these alternative ways of restricting demand. Section V summarises the problems raised in the Survey, from the point of view of the formulation ofa consistent, practicable and acceptable set of targets for the use of the national resources.3. It may be of interest at this stage to compare what actually happened in the man-power sphere up to September 1946, and what was envisaged at thetime of- the last Survey&apos;s production. Details are given in the Appendix at theend of this Survey, but the main features can be summarised as follows : 4. The numbers available to meet requirements in September 1946 were greater than was expected by 48,000. A larger number of women remaining in work and a smaller number of unemployed more than offset the slower rate of return to industry of men on demobilisation leave.5. Nevertheless, manufacturing industries other than metals, engineering and chemicals (i.e., the group which includes the main consumer goods industries)were 332,000 (nearly 10 per cent.) short of their requirements; building and civil engineering were 110,000 behind their original programme; agricultural man-power was 23,000 short of the requirement; and coal-mining showed an absolute fall.6.   These results were mainly the consequence of three factors: :(a) The gap of 260,000 between requirements and supply exhibited in the survey not having been closed, it was inevitable that some programmes should fall short of requirements;(h) There was a strong tendency, to which attention had been drawn, forthe distribution of labour to favour the metal, engineering and chemical industries, and these industries exceeded their stated require-ments by 57,000;(c) The expansion in distribution was as forecast, but actual expansionexceeded the forecast in services other than distribution by 113,000and in Government service (chiefly local government) by 94,000.The ceiling for the Armed Forces at the end of 1946 had been raised since thedate of the Survey, but up to September 1946, this change accounted for anincrease of only 27,000.II Resources and Demands7. A general view of the total national resources available in 1947, and ofthe prospective demands on those resources, can be shown in terms of national income and national expenditure. A comparison in these terms is contained inTable A, at the end of this Section. On the income side of the account is shown the &quot;target&quot; national income, i.e., a money valuation of the total national product which will be available if resources are fully used, on the assumptionthat a serious inflationary rise in money prices and costs is avoided. On theexpenditure side are shown in comparable money terms the various demands whichare competing for the national product.8. The basis for the estimate of &quot;target&quot; national income is stated inparagraphs 9-12, and for the estimates of national expenditure in paragraphs13-19.Target National Income9. The size of the national product depends primarily upon the size of theworking labour force and upon output per man-year.   The working population
employed is expected to rise by 125,000 during the first half of the year, but to fall by 220,000 in the second half.* In the first half of the year the return to industry of men on demobilisation leave is expected to exceed any further outflow of women. In the second half, there will be no such net inflow, and because ofthe raising of the school-leaving age, there will not be the customary number ofnew juveniles to offset the retirement of older persons.10. The numbers unemployed are put at 370,000 for the beginning of theyear, falling subsequently to a steady 350,000. This is equivalent to 2^ per cent,of all insured workers, and assumes unemployment of only \\ per cent, outsidethe Development Areas. These are low figures on any reckoning and are asymptom of the prevalent highly inflationary pressure of demand. They shouldbe regarded as a target rather than a forecast of what will actually happen,since they do not include any allowance for the effects of coal and other shortageson industrial activity (see paragraphs 43-55 below), or for any loss of employment which might be due to stoppages or industrial unrest.11. The figure of target national income is in money terms. The estimateof the wage bill is based on the assumption that average weekly earnings of labour for the year as a whole average 7\ per cent, higher in 1947 than in 1946. this estimate is in turn based on the assumption that both wage-rates and average weekly earnings rise between July 1946 and July 1947 by 5 per cent., wage ratesrising only half as much as in the previous twelve months. It assumes, therefore,that no new cycle of major wage increases occurs in 1947.12. In so far as these income rises represent increases not in output butin costs, adjustments need to be made to the prices of goods and services on thedemand side. This, as far as possible, has been done. It is difficult, however, atthe present time to make this adjustment accurately because insufficient is knownof changes in productivity, i.e., in output per man. In 1946, output per man in anumber of lines was abnormally low because of reconversion difficulties, resulting inthe existence of unbalanced labour teams, and &quot; teething troubles &quot; in production.In 1947, many of these difficulties will be past and production will be under way.But &quot;bottleneck &quot; problems due to specific shortages, which were also present in1946, may be more serious in 1947. The number of hours worked in the year may also be fewer. For these reasons, it has been assumed that average output perman in 1947 differs little from the average in 1946. tNotional Expenditure13. In previous Surveys, the aggregate of claims shown against the national income did not represent the full pressure in the market. A number of importantdemands were represented only by limited requirements, as put forward by the responsible Departments, taking account of the practicable limits within whichparticular supplies might be expanded within the period. Personal consumptiondemand, investment demand and exports were all seriously understated on this basis, and the picture presented assumed as background a fairly strong systemof rationing and price control capable of withstanding the inflationary pressure of high demand on the limited supplies of goods.14. This method, however, is becoming increasingly unreal, particularly inregard to the statement of consumption requirements, where the abolition of rationing and the provision of supplies adequate to meet public demand must beconsidered a major objective of policy. Moreover, with net demobilisation fromthe Forces planned to come to a standstill in mid-1947 (cf. para. 37 below), it isuseful to consider how far our resources are adequate to meet a more normal levelof demand.15. In Table A below, some regard has been had to this changed situation as far as personal consumption is concerned. The other claims on resources,however, are treated on the same basis as in previous Surveys.   Government* See Table C, below.f 11 - 1h 0f .course&apos; tllere were to be a Ial1 in tne Price of our imports without a correspondingtall m the price of our exports, this would correspond to an increase in productivity, since it wouldenable us to obtain more imports for any given amount of exports. It is not impossible that theprices of our imports of foodstuffs and raw materials should decline in the second half of 1947.fU 104.7 a movement is verv uncertain and would in any case be unlikely to affect the figures and 1949aS * whole very SUDstantiahy-   Such a movement might be more important for 1948[32823] B 2
expenditure on goods and services is, of course, a controlled figure. So, to a lessextent, is the adverse foreign balance; the figure shown is the programme figureput forward by the Balance of Payments Working- Party (M.E.P. (46) 10), andthe balance of payments account from which it is derived is as given in Table B.Estimates of public and private investment might perhaps have been made onthe basis of what demand would be in a free market, given the present low rateof interest. But the result would be very large figures, which it would be extremely difficult to estimate. Moreover, the removal of controls is not assumed to be an objective of policy in the case of investment, as it is in the case of consumption. For these reasons, the estimates of investment demand are againbased upon realistic requirements which take account of limitations in productivecapacity. In so far as Government control should prove insufficient to preventinflationary price rises or the attraction of more resources into these fields,however, these estimates understate the effective demand.16. The term &quot; requirement &quot; can, of course, be interpreted in many ways,and it is not possible to judge whether all the various departmental claims havethe same degree of urgency, particularly as regards the marginal items in thoseclaims. The most important elements in the requirements, other than for personal consumption, in Tables A and B, are as follows : ;DefenceArmed Forces of 1,385,000 at the beginning, running down to 1,200,000at the end of 1947.Expenditure at home and abroad on goods and services for defence purposes (other than pay of the Forces, terminal payments, compen-sation, gratuities, &amp;c.) of about  550 million.*.      Other Government current activityA total of about 670,000 non-industrial Civil Servants at the end of1947, compared with 709,000 in July 1946 and 400,000 in April1939.A small increase in the numbers employed in local government service, ofwhich the total was 1,019,000 in September 1946 and 846,000 in1939.Domestic gross investmentCompletion of 240,000 new permanent houses in the year (compared with.360,000 in 1938), together with other accommodation, other houseconstruction and house maintenance.Man-power in the building and civil engineering industries to rise from1,240,000 at September 1946 to 1,370,000 at December 1947, corn-pared with 1,310,000 in mid-1939.Fixed capital investment other than in housing, including current anddelayed maintenance other than house maintenance, at about 25 percent, above the amount undertaken in 1938.Foreign balanceA volume of exports 50 per cent, above 1938 in the second half of 1947,compared with 4 per cent, above 1938 in the third quarter of 1946.Receipts from exports, including invisibles, in 1947 nearly enough tocover the cost of imports at 83 per cent, of their 1938 volume; but,a total adverse foreign balance of some  220 million after taking into account net Government expenditure overseas of  175 million.17. Personal Consumption. Information about programmes has beensought from Departments. At the same time calculations have been made of how much private incomes would be spent on consumption on the assumption that* This expenditure probably represents the employment of about 1,200,000 workers engaged(a) in manufacturing supplies and equipment for the Forces (about 500,000), (6) in the non-industrial Civil Service, Service and Supply Departments (166,000 in July 1946), (c) in producingexports to pay for military expenditure abroad and for imported defence supplies, and (d) in providing transport, fuel and other services and in maintaining military establishments. A certainproportion of these workers is engaged in providing food, clothing, accommodation, &amp;c, for theForces, which they would also require if in civil life.
direct taxation continues at current rates and on alternative assumptions as tothe proportion of income saved. The following table shows the proportion ofspendable income saved in 1938 and 1945, and the amount which would be saved(and therefore the amount which would be spent) in 1947 on two assumptions :  Assumption A : If there were the same proportion of saving as in 1938, andAssumption B: If the amount of saving were that implied by the 1947Departmental requirements for consumption : 1938Current private income after tax      ...    4,486Personal expenditure on consumption... 4,160Net private saving      .........      3261945 1947  million7,103 8,127Assumption A       Assumption B5,645 7,537 -    7,1551,458 590 972per cent.7.3 12.0Proportion of post-tax income saved ...      7.3      20.518. The principal dements in these two alternative levels of personal con-sumption may be stated as follows : A ssumption AAllowing for price changes but not for differences in the quality ofmany products and services -the level of consumption would, on average, be about 10 per cent, above the 1938 level and 30 per cent,above the 1945 level.Assumption BThe average standard of food consumption at the same level as in theyear July 1945-June 1946, with the present Is. 4d. meat ration, anda slight increase in certain items, particularly fruit.Clothing, boots and shoes, household textiles and durable household goods all below pre-war, with a basic adult clothing ration statedfor this purpose at a rate of 75 coupons a year.Private motoring expenditure at about three-quarters the pre-war rate,allowing for price changes.For most other items the figures are forecasts, based on current trends,taking account of supply limitations, although the figures for fuelare targets. Except for domestic service, they represent a volumeof consumption appreciably above the pre-war level, On certain items, particularly beer, tobacco and entertainment, forecast con-sumption is high partly because of shortages of food and other essential goods.19. It will be seen from Table A that, on Assumption A the demands on resources for consumption and for other purposes already enumerated would exceed the total available national product by  648 million or by 1\ per cent. Thisis not by any means a full measure of the inflationary pressure of demand on resources. In the first place, as has already been noted, the demands for invest-ment purposes are already severely pruned to make them more realistic in relationto available supplies; but in so far as the direct controls over part of the demandfor investment purposes (e.g., machinery) may not be sufficiently watertight, someinflationary pressure is likely to develop in this field. In the second place, in viewof the back-log of consumers&apos; needs and of the accumulation of liquid war-timepersonal savings, it is probable that saving out of spendable private incomewould be less than the 1938 rate. Indeed, there might well be a measure of netdis-saving. The reduction of the rate of net private saving to zero during 1947would add another  590 million to the gap as shown on Assumption A in Table A.

III The Balance between Income and Expenditure20. Table A reveals a gap between the total national resources available in1947, as measured by the target national income, and the prospective demands upon those resources, as represented by the various items of national expenditure.This gap is  648 million on Assumption A and  266 million on Assumption B.The most satisfactory way of closing this gap would be by raising the targetnational income. In so far as this cannot be achieved, the gap must be closed bydemand being prevented from reaching the market.Ways of increasing income21. A mere numerical increase in income, brought about by a rise in moneywage rates or other costs, would not help. Such an increase would be whollybalanced by an increase in prices, and therefore in the magnitude of the claims on the expenditure side of the account. The need is for an increase in real output,and this can come about only through an addition to the numbers employed or through an increase in the output per head of those whose employment is alreadyassumed.22. An increase in the numbers employed might be brought about in two ways : either by a reduction in numbers of the working population unemployed,or by an increase in the working population itself through fewer people with-drawing from industry, through the entry into work of those unoccupied, or through the importation of workers from abroad.23. The basis of the assumed level of unemployment has been stated above(see paragraph 10). The only foreseeable improvement on this forecast wouldbe if, by a greater concentration of activity, some of the factories in the Develop-ment Areas could be brought into operation more quickly than is at present antici-pated. This would only be effective if sufficient materials, fuel and power couldbe made available without inflicting comparable losses elsewhere. On the otherhand, attempts to shift labour between industries, such as are envisaged below(see Section V), may result in a temporary increase in unemployment.24. It is possible that a larger number of women might be attracted into industry. If so, they would be particularly valuable, since most of the industries which manufacture consumers&apos; goods at present in short supply are in need offemale labour. The retirement of women from industry since the war has been250,000 less than was expected, and it appears that women are not unwilling togo into factories if the work is sufficiently near their homes, if it is agreeableand conditions attractive, and if hours are short.25. In the matter of workers from abroad, account has already been taken of Irish workers in the net changes in the working population resulting fromimmigration, but not, so far, of the Polish Resettlement Corps, or of possibleadditional groups of foreign workers which might be brought into this country.The advantage of these classes of workers is greater than the numerical additionwhich they provide to the working population, because, within the limits of housing them, they can more readily be directed or steered to particular jobs tohelp in overcoming industrial &quot;bottlenecks.&quot;26. As observed in paragraph 13, the level of productivity implicit inTable A and throughout the Tables in this Survey is an assumption, and not a forecast. We must, of course, look to an increase in productivity for any large increase in the national product. But prospects of an immediate improvementare not bright, and increased industrial unrest, reductions in output per man-hour, sickness.of absenteeism, and shortages of fuel, materials or componentsresulting in a slowing down of work or in temporary idleness, may all result ina reduction in productivity and render more difficult the achievement of a satis-f satisfactory volume of supplies.27. Any increase in employment or in productivity should increase thenational product, and so increase the power to satisfy the real needs of thecountry. But not all of this increase would go to relieve the inflationary pressure.As available supplies increase, the incomes of producers will rise as well; paitof this increase will be absorbed in taxation, part will be saved, &amp;o, but onlyto the extent that the increased income is thus withheld from the market is the inflationary pressure reduced. In so far as demand increases as well as supply,the pressure remains unchanged.
Ways of reducing expenditure28. If income cannot be sufficiently increased, expenditure must be restricted. The table below shows the proportion of the national incomeabsorbed by each of the main categories of demand in 1938 and in 1945, andthe proportion of the target national income to which, on the basis of Table Aabove, each category of demand would lay claim for 1947.Personal consumptionDefence ............Other Government current expenditure gross capital expenditure   ......Less Capital depreciation  ...Net foreign balance ...Gap     ...      ...      ...      ......1938	194578	547	4910	716 	6-10	-6- 1*	-10Percentage of national incomeAssumption A731947Assumption B68i10121- 7- 24-3100100100100* Gross investment is a better measure of the changes in the relative claims which investmentmakes over the three years than is net investment (i.e., gross investment less depreciation), sincethe figure used for depreciation, which is largely based on Inland Revenue allowances, is calculated in the main on the original cost of existing assets which, in a period of rising prices, is less than their replacement cost.29. Government current expenditure and the Government part of grosscapital investment, in that they are most closely under control, might, from theadministrative point of view, be the easiest items of expenditure to reduce. Theprincipal objects of Government current expenditure are the Armed forces and the central and local Government services. The requirement for the armed forces at the end of 1947 is no lower than the target originally set for the endof 1946, and employment in the various fields of Government service is nearly50 per cent, higher than pre-war. A. detailed analysis of central and localGovernment employment is given in Table 7 of the Statistical Appendix. Thelargest single constituent of Government capital expenditure is housing, andpublicly-owned utility supplies also figure high in the list. But not everythingis of this level of priority, and, if desired, economies could be found.30. A detailed breakdown of the requirement for gross capital formation,public and private, is given in Table 5 of tihe Statistical Appendix. A large part consists in making good war-time arrears of maintenance and depreciationby repair and replacement. Another part is the construction of factories toprovide employment in the Development Areas. Not all of the capital construc-tion and plant installation proposed for 1947, however, is in these two classes,though it might be difficult to impose any drastic restriction below the levelsallowed by capacity without recasting the existing controls.31. It would be possible to augment the supply of goods and services avail-able by bringing a larger volume of imports into this country or by reducingthe volume of exports sent abroad. Either of these policies would raise the basic&quot; hard currency &quot; problem, set out in M.E.P. (46) 10, in which it is shown thatour dollar deficit is far more serious than the total deficit figure in Table B would indicate. It is impossible significantly to expand our 1947 imports from non-dollar sources beyond what is already contemplated in the import programme, sothat increased imports to alleviate our internal situation could only be obtained atthe expense of further acceleration in the rate of drawings on the United Statesline of credit. A deliberate reduction in our exports might have highly damagingeffects upon our long-term commercial interests and upon the willingness of manufacturers to concentrate upon export markets. The present great pressure on our internal resources, however, and the great need to moderate the rate ofdrawings on the United States line of credit, strongly reinforce the need to make sure that we do not, except in most exceptional circumstances, export goods to countries which do not pay for them either in goods or in gold or in convertiblecurrencies, so that supplies may be available in as great a volume as possible forexport to those countries which do so pay for them.32.   It is obvious that, even if specific supply difficulties did not impose the necessity, continued sacrifices must be demanded of personal consumptionbefore any balance of resources can be established.   In fact, in the case of food,[32823] c
and probably in cases such as furniture, dependent upon timber, procurableimports are inadequate to meet a demand of the dimensions which Assumption a would require, while, in other cases, supplies from home production could onlybe built up gradually, and, under present conditions, would be inadequate evenif goods now being exported were diverted to the home market.33. As a first step, therefore, towards bringing targets into line withpracticabilities, it appears necessary to abandon the possibility of personal con-sumption in 1947 at the level of Assumption A, and to concentrate attention on themore limited Departmental requirements represented in Assumption B. It mustbe emphasised, however, that the levels of Assumption B are not in any sensea forecast of what will happen in 1947. As shown in the Sections IV and V,there will be serious difficulties in the way of achieving even these levels.34. By one means or another total resources and demands will be broughtinto balance in 1947. If the process is left to work itself out without anyconscious intervention there would be a danger that the less essential needs wouldbe met rather than the more essential, and that a serious inflationary movementmight start. To bring demands more nearly into line with resources, it is clearthat consumption will have to be limited at least within the levels ofAssumption B. The mere limitation of supplies on the consumption market doesnot, of course, reduce the inflationary pressure. On the contrary, the moresupplies are reduced without corresponding reduction of demand, the greater isthe inflationary pressure which has to be resisted. On the basis of Assumption B,current private income to the extent of  2,640 million* quite apartfrom previously accumulated savings must be kept off the consumption goodsmarket, either through taxation or through forced savings brought about byshortages of the particular things needed, queues and rationing. Such limitationsmay discourage incentives to effort and enterprise, with possible adverse effectsupon the national income. Any further cuts in supplies of consumption goodswould both enlarge the inflationary gap and increase these dangers.* I.e., direct taxes ( 1,668 million) plus private saving ( 972 million) as shown in the statistical Appendix, Table 1.
IV. Current Man-power Trends and Particular Shortages35. In deciding the general economic plan for 1947 account must be taken of certain special difficulties. The main obstacle to economic planning is the lackof adequate means for affecting the distribution of the labour force. And inthe circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day, shortages of basic suppliesnot only check the growth of production in certain fields, but threaten to disturbthe economy as a whole.Current man-power trends36. The claims for man-power in the middle and at the end of 1947, whichare calculated to correspond with the departmental requirements for expenditure(on Assumption B in respect of personal consumption), are shown in Table C atthe end of this section. As with the expenditure estimates, they are in excess ofthe total resources available. Moreover, the man-power gap increases towardsthe end of the year.37. The Government have undertaken to demobilise a substantial number ofmen from the Armed Forces by the end of 1948, but, on present programmes, thenet outflow from the Forces in 1947, as from work on their supplies, will be small.At the same time, the raising of the school-leaving age in April 1947 will haltthe customary flow of juveniles for 12-18 months thereafter, and ultimatelyreduce the working population by upwards of 370,000 persons. Mid-1947, there-fore, will see an end to that expansion in industrial employment on civil and export work which has been in progress since early 1945, while the raising ofthe school-leaving age will remove for a time an important source of recruitment to certain industries, e.g., coal and textiles, which it is urgent to man, and, ingeneral, throw upon older workers jobs which have hitherto been done more economically by fourteen-year-olds.38. In view of these facts, and the strong pressure of demand for labour at all points, substantial changes in the distribution of the present labour force,unless specially induced, are not to be expected. Table D1 at the end of thissection compares the man-power requirements for the end of 1947 with thedistribution of man-power which seems, in fact, most likely to come about in theabsence of strong measures to enforce changes.39. Achievement of the requirement for the Armed Forces depends uponthe rate of recruitment of volunteers and upon decisions taken by Ministers withregard to the release programme. As these are matters at present under review,discussion of the prospects for the civil economy must provisionally proceed onthe assumption that this requirement is fully met. A working population of18,380,000 is then available for industrial employment at the end of 1947. InSeptember 1946 the corresponding number was 17,896,000. Rather less than half a million additional persons are thus available for industry.40. Between September 1946 and the end of 1947, expansion in a numberof industries other than manufacturing and the fuel and power industries mustbe expected. First, distribution and other consumer services are likely to increase by some 110,000. So far, the number of women in these service industries has remained little changed since the war. Employment of men, which was half that of pre-war in mid-1945, had risen by September 1946 to a little over two-thirds of the pre-war figure, but the lack of juvenile recruits is expected to restrain the expansion of these trades in 1947. Secondly, the building and civil engineering industries at September were 160,000 behind the target of 1,400,000which they were set to reach by the end of 1946. A lower target of 1,370,000has now been put forward for the end of 1947, and the 130,000 recruitmentrequired to reach it should be achievable.41. In the case of the public service, further expansion in the localauthorities is expected to offset the very slight reduction from the high numbers,I compared with pre-war, in the non-industrial Civil Service. In the case ofj agriculture, the full man-power requirement for 1947, allowing for the continued! low numbers of livestock (see para. 53 below) and a slightly lower croppingJ programme, is 1,075,000. But it is hoped to get through with the present labour I force given the addition of prisoners-of-war, Poles and other Government-? provided labour. If the repatriation of prisoners is speeded up the generaldemand for labour in agriculture will be raised, and, in any case, seasonal[32823] c 2
labour (which is not included in the mid-1947 figure) is expected to be deficient.The apparent equilibrium in agricultural man-power is therefore uncertain and temporary.42. As no substantial decreases in employment are proposed, there remainabout 250,000 additional workers for manufacturing, for the.public utility servicesand for mining, as compared with their additional requirements of 862,000. Asshown in Table D, the major part of the deficiency, in the absence of effectivecountervailing action, is likely to fall on the textile and clothing industries, inwhich the shortfall is estimated at as much as 325,000, or 19 per cent, of therequirements. Coalmining and the clay industries (especially brickmaking, fromwhich prisoners of war will also be withdrawn) are likely to experience serious,although proportionately less significant, deficiencies. The metal and engineering industries, although expected to continue their expansion, may not reach the full requirements stated, and some difficulty may be felt by the public utilities.Shortages and bottlenecks.43. Thus far, the discussion of the prospects in 1947 has been almost entirely in terms of broad categories of demand and supply and of the distribution oflabour between broad groups of industries. But the situation is complicated byparticular shortages and bottlenecks in the supply of a number of importantmaterials and commodities. These shortages are themselves in part a symptomof the general inflationary pressure of demand and the formulation of a broadplan to ease that pressure will help to remove them. Nevertheless, they complicate the drawing of clear-cut conclusions and, unless removed, might render any generalplan of little purpose.44. The most important, because the most far-reaching, of these shortages is,of course, coal. Shortages in iron and steel, in timber, in cotton and wool yarn,in electricity and in animal feeding-stuffs directly affect the running of the economy in general or important sections of it.45. Coal. There has been an upward trend in output per man-shift in thecoal-mining industry since the autumn of 1945, and in the attendance record since may 1946. On the other hand, the number of wage-earners, which remainedsteady over the greater part of 1946, began its expected decline in the early autumn; and, in consequence of the raising of the school-leaving age, the termina-tion of the inflow of ex-miners from the Forces, and the release of &quot; Bevin boys,&quot;a further fall must be expected in 1947.46. The upward trend in productivity is already taken into account in theMinistry of Fuel and Power&apos;s forecast of deep-mined coal output for the coalyear, May 1946 to April 1947, of 180 million tons. But a gap of some 3 to 5 million tons remains, and unless production can be increased above this forecast, ashortage of coal will cause unemployment or short-time working in the early months of 1947.47. The outlook for the coal year 1947-48 depends upon the success of thepresent efforts to check the decline in man-power, and upon what the National coal board may be able to achieve in the way of increasing productivity during its first year of operation. It is considered that deep-mined coal output must reach about190 million tons for a reasonable balance between inland requirements and avail-able supplies to be reached. The average number of workers on colliery books in1947-48, however, is forecast at about 660,000,* though in the light of presenttrends this figure may be somewhat higher. On that basis, annual output per man would have to rise from 260 tons to 290 tons, i.e., by around 11 percent., for the account to balance. This would represent an output per man as high as in 1938 and an even higher output per man-shift if a five-day weekand an extra week&apos;s holiday with pay are introduced. If only half that increasein productivity were achieved, there would be a deficit between inland require-ments and available supplies of 10 million tons.48. These estimates make no allowance for additional exports. Quite apartfrom the balance of payments, however, larger coal exports would make the procurement of greater quantities of timber very much easier, and would put us ina strong bargaining position in getting other necessary imports, besides enablingus better to aid the European countries whose economic stability it is in our interest to foster.* Equivalent to a total man-power figure of 700,000, as in Table D.
49. Iron and steel. Some of the difficulties in securing iron and steelsupplies may be ascribed to the prior bottleneck in coal and to labour shortages in critical sections of the industry (particularly sheet mills, tin plate, and ironfoundries); but more are due to difficulties of import largely beyond our control.There is a prospective shortage of finished steel, over 1947 as a whole, of theorder of one-fifth or one-sixth of requirements, or 2,000,000 tons. The consequenceof these shortages will be felt in most sections of industry, but particularly in the motor industry, in structural steel for building, in electrical engineering and inthe manufacture of industrial machinery.50. Timber. Softwood, hardwood and plywood are all extremely short.They are likely to remain a severe drag on the building and furniture industries and they also have considerable effect elsewhere for example, a shortage of rail-way sleepers. Imports are limited principally by the devastations of war and the intensity of domestic demand in the exporting countries, but also (in the case ofScandinavian softwoods) by the lack of coal exports from this country.51. Cotton and wool yarn. The problem of manning the textile industries,where the ruling bottleneck is in the spinning sections, not only makes increasein the clothing ration difficult, but leaves a serious gap in our exports, particularly on a long-term view. Moreover, the resulting shortage of textile supplies forexport is holding back the production of needed food-stuffs and raw materials inthose countries (especially in Africa and the Tar East) where an adequate supplyof imported textiles is the only effective incentive to output.52. Electricity. Electricity will be required in greater quantity in 1947than in 1946, and the supply is limited by generating capacity. Despite the priorities accorded to the construction of new plant and buildings, it is not improbable that local load-shedding may give rise to intermittent dislocations ofindustry over wide areas.53. Animal feeding-stuffs. Shortage of animal feeding-stuffs, due to lackof wheat imports and imports of concentrates, will delay the much-needed expan-sion in dairy output, impede the recovery in cattle numbers, and hold pigs and poultry to very low levels. The effects of this will be seriously to limit the expan-sion in the production of milk, and to prevent expansion in home supplies of meat,bacon and eggs in 1947.54.   Other imported materials. Shortages in the supplies of lead, linseedoil, and certain types of hides and paper, all of which are imported, will have con-siderable ramifications.   The supplies of electric cable and batteries, paint,linoleum, plasterboard, and cement (through shortage of packaging materiespecially critical commodities likely to be affected.55. Building materials. In the Economic Survey for 1946-47, particular attention was drawn to the danger from shortage of building materials. As juststated, steel, timber and paint still present an acute problem, but action taken inthe course of the year did much to prevent breakdown in the supply of, in par-ticular, bricks, where a combination of foreign labour, a rise in wages, and special attention to the recruitment of labour generally and to fuel and machinery, provedeffective. Owing to the prospective shortage of labour, fuel and machinery, similar action will continue to be necessary if the supply of building materials in 1947 isto meet requirements.

V. General Summary and Issues for Decision56 The expansion of civil and export employment, which has been innrosress since early 1945, will end in 1947; and it follows that the economic problems of 1947 are likely to be dominant in 1948 and probably also m 1949.The problems raised by this Survey and the decisions to be taken now are likelyto affect the shape of our economy for several years ahead.The overburdening- of the economy57. The Survey reveals gaps between supply and demand in terms ofnational income and expenditure, in man-power and in raw materials. All thesegaps mean the same thing, namely, that we are trying to do substantially morethan is within our present capacity.58. This is due to several reasons. First, we are now trying to set asideout of the current national income larger amounts of resources than before thewar for defence and for exports. Secondly, consumption demand is higher thanpre-war both because abnormally large savings were accumulated during the war,and because, compared with pre-war, current consumption demand is now ahigher proportion of current income. Full employment, the introduction of minimum standards supported by subsidies, higher rates of national insurance benefit and of old age pensions, and redistribution of income through taxation,have all contributed to this. Thirdly, in several ways our resources are smallerby pre-war standards. The efficiency of a large part of our capital equipmenthas been lowered through lack of proper maintenance and repair in the war years; though our level of activity is higher than pre-war, our imports, largely because of world shortage, are only some four-fifths of their pre-war volume;lastly, besides the removal of the juveniles, there is a general move towards a shorter working week.Financial problems59. The overburdening of the economy shows itself most obviously in the highly inflationary demand in almost all sectors. This has been discussed inSection II, but is of particular significance in the market for consumption goods.The general excess of spendable incomes over the supply of goods is increasedby the subsidisation of food-stuffs and other commodities. The difficulty whichworkers find in buying the goods they want makes it less worthwhile to earnmore, and thus discourages increases in productivity.60. This inflationary pressure is the direct or indirect cause of many other of the problems discussed in this Survey. But in so far as it is not yet feasible tobring full market demand at current prices into line with available supply,widespread control will need to continue as a means of limiting effective demand,withstanding the inflationary pressure on prices, and ensuring that essential supplies are safeguarded.The size of the national product.61. As pointed out in Section II, the most satisfactory way of bringingdemand and supply more closely into line would be by increasing supply. Theprincipal ways of doing this are by augmenting the labour force and by raisingproductivity per man. Increased borrowing from abroad to tide over the periodof stringency, apart from any objections on balance of payments grounds, haspractical limitations. First, the volume of goods which could be obtained by thismeans may be strictly limited by world shortage or by the strong demand in localmarkets abroad. Secondly, the length of the breathing space which foreignborrowing would provide is strictly limited, and home production might notexpand sufficiently in the time to prevent a more stringent situation at the endthan at the beginning.62. As a means of increasing the available labour force, the attraction ofa larger number of married women into industry and the use of more foreign workers, particularly for the purpose of breaking particular bottlenecks, have thebest prospect, though the latter is subject to more housing accommodation being&apos;provided. &amp;63.   The principal means of bringing about the expansion of output that must eventually be provided, is by a higher output per man.   Unfortunately, norapid solution of the general problem can be expected from this source    The[32823] ja
principal means of raising productivity per man is increased mechanisation. Butmechanisation takes time. Over a period of years, the present high level of investment may be expected to raise substantially the general level of productivity,but it would be too optimistic to expect any appreciable benefit in 1947. On theother hand, the process of mechanisation, unless the machines can be importedinvolves the use of labour and, as will be emphasised below, while labour is short&apos;the man-power which we can afford to set aside for the production of capital goodsis limited. Any immediate increase in productivity, therefore, must mainly comethrough more efficient management, better deployment of labour, and more intensive activity on the part of the worker in industry, using existing plant, andin the service industries.The balance between consumption and investment64. In these circumstances, there is no alternative for the immediate futurebut to direct attention mainly to the division between the competing claims of anational product more or less of the size forecast. All possible means ofincreasing output should be sought, but to the extent that means of increasingsupplies are not or cannot be found, restrictions must be placed on some or alldemands, effectively to reduce them to a volume consistent with the forecast volumeof supply.*65. It is essential that our balance of payments should be fully restoredbefore we have exhausted the United States&apos; line of credit. For this reason, itwould probably be unwise to consider any deliberate cut in the export target. Ifthis is ruled out, and military demands cannot be reduced, the choice is betweencuts in consumption and cuts in investment; and if some moderate savings on military demands or exports were possible, this would nevertheless remain thecentral issue.66. The one remaining possibility might be to restrict still further the size of distribution and the other service trades. The only mechanism now available is the squeezing of distributive margins, which traders at the present time are seeking to widen. Distribution is expected at the end of 1947 still to be 587,000,and other services 225,000, below their 1939 levels. If, however, as is suggestedbelow, means are sought for releasing labour from some manufacturing industries for the purpose of manning others, it will be necessary to prevent too large a proportion of this prospective gain from going into these service industries.67. It is clear that, in 1947 and for some time ahead restrictions on con-sumption relative to market demands are inevitable on account both of the generaldeficiency between expenditure demand and available supplies, and of theshortages of particular consumption supplies discussed in Section IV. Prac-tically all the basic items of household consumption will be in short supply : food,houses, furniture, clothing, household textiles and coal. The question of policy involved, therefore, is not whether consumption goods should be restricted, buthow austere the restrictions should be.68. If the whole of the man-power gap of 630,000 at the end of 1947 wereto fall on consumption, the supply of consumption goods and services would bebelow present levels.   Textiles would be likely particularly to suffer.69. On the other hand, if consumption is to be allowed to reach the quitemoderate targets of Assumption B, and the whole of the gap to fall on homeinvestment, the man-power working for home investment at the end of 1947 would need to be 630,000 below the stated requirements. The first question is whetherit is practicable to reduce the building target, and, if so, whether this could bedone without any adverse repercussion on the housing programme which absorbsover half the building labour force. In so far as this is ruled out, and theend-1947 man-power gap made to fall upon the metal and engineering industriesproducing capital goods for the home market, two problems would arise. Itwould be necessary both to withdraw labour from the metal and engineering industries and to employ a larger proportion of the workers in those industries on export orders. The first course would mean a sharp reversal of the currentupward trend, some temporary unemployment and a possible loss to the working population; the second would involve a reduction in the target for exports of* Some small excess of &apos;&apos; planned &apos;&apos; demands over probable supplies may, of course, properly be left unresolved. War-time experience has suggested that such a margin is generally desirableas a means of ensuring the full utilisation of resources.
textiles and other consumers&apos; goods so as to release a larger amount for home consumption to be made good by a compensating increase in the target for exportsof metal and engineering products.70. The composition of exports has already altered in the direction impliedin this second course, and will continue so to alter in 1947. There is little chanceof any appreciable rise in textile exports in 1947 and the strong probability ofa substantial reduction in order to honour the higher clothing ration proposed.On the other hand, it is upon an increase in engineering exports that we are mainly relying in order to sustain and increase the total volume of our exports in 1947. A change in the balance of exports greater than is already contem-plated would thus be doubly difficult: first, because it might inflict serious damage to our long-term prospects in textile exports; and secondly, becausethe export target for engineering products is already high in relation to thepresent level of production.71. Any proposal to restrict the output of engineering products for thehome market creates a dilemma. As noted earlier in this Section the eventualsolution of the problems of shortage must mainly come through capital re-equip-ment and new capital installations. The only way of resolving this dilemmais by means of a more selective policy in the approval of factory projects andcontrol of other capital development than has been operated hitherto. The choice of criteria is obviously a matter for close enquiry. Maintenance work andthe provision of adequate power supplies are obvious essentials. But if themaximum contribution is to be obtained from a restricted amount of development,the immediate need will be to concentrate on those projects which do not involve an inordinate amount of current labour, which will save labour eventually, andwhich will do so within a not unreasonable space of time. Power installationsmay have to wait upon power supplies, and the number of other developmentswhose principal result is to save labour is fairly limited. The more quickly these can be brought into effect, without being held up for labour, materials or plantby competing schemes of lower priority, the more quickly will an increase in thenational income be achieved, and the more quickly will a more generous invest-ment programme become practicable.Supply shortages72. There remains the central problem of the vital shortages which, as inthe case of coal, steel and electricity, threaten to hold up a whole range of produc-tion, or, as in the case of timber and cotton yarn, impede in a more specific wayparticular lines of essential production. If effective measures are not taken tobreak the bottlenecks of the former type (particularly coal), the whole programmeof economic rehabilitation will be thrown out of joint. These shortages constitute an additional reason for some substantial pruning of investment programmes,since the industries producing metal and engineering products are particularlylarge users of steel and power, while industrial building is also a consumer ofsteel and timber.73. The fact that man-power shortage and particular material shortagesare often closely however, does not only mean that measures to restrictcertain lines of activity will ease the pressure on materials. It also means thatthe distribution schemes for scarce materials have a potent influence in deter-mining the general shape of the economy. In such cases, the principles followed in allocating and controlling the distribution of raw materials will need to be closely correlated with whatever decisions are taken towards the formulation of a general plan.Government and industry74. The existence of shortages and a limited national income in comparisonwith all the purposes on hand raises two important questions in the relationship between Government and industry to which attention ought perhaps to be drawn.75. The first problem is whether, if shortages develop to a degree notearlier foreseen and result in a reduced output, undertakings between theGovernment and industry regarding the proportion of production going to export may not need to be revised. For example, if the proportion of motor-carexports remains unchanged, a shortage of sheet steel will reduce exports to an extent greater than we may desire.[32823] d 2
76.   The second problem is how far the Governments view of priorities canbe imposed to the advantage or disadvantage of one particular industry or firm  Iin comparison with others.   During the war, there was available the criterionof priority for the war effort, whieh it was fairly simple to apply.   Now thatin a peace-time economy, there is not the same singleness of purpose thereis a tendency on the part of industry to expect, and on the part of Departments  Ito apply, a doctrine of equality of treatment extending to cases which may not   1from the point of view of the national economy, be matters of indifference at all&apos;77. This question of selective allocations has already arisen in regard to thesupply of coal to industry. The same point is likely to be met in the allocations of steel and other raw materials, and has also arisen in the field of capital invest- Iment, Thus, should preference be given to one firm as against its competitorswhen there is enough labour to enable one firm&apos;s project to be completed quicklywhile, if all started together, none would be achieved without undue delay?Offices of the Cabinet, S.

APPENDIXMan-Power at September 19461. This Appendix examines the man-power targets for September 1946,as stated in the Economic Survey for 1946-47 (M.E.P. (46) 5), and the degree towhich they have been fulfilled.2.   The table annexed shows the position.3. The total working population was only 72,000 greater than forecast.The number of insured unemployed to be deducted was 90,000 less than anti-cipated in the 1946-47 Survey. On the other hand, the number of demobilisedex-service men and women who had not yet taken up employment was 110,000more than forecast in the Survey. On balance, then, the available working popu-lation was 48,000 more than forecast.4. The analysis of the 1946-47 Survey showed a prospective shortfall of260,000 in the available working population below the aggregate requirements.As the requirements were not written down to close this gap, it was inevitable that all the requirements could not be met. As the available working populationwas in fact 48,000 larger, the shortfall below the total of forecast requirementswas reduced to 212,000.5. In addition, the Governments amended policy as to numbers in theForces will mean substantial changes in the requirement under this heading forthe last quarter of 1946. But in September it had only to be increased by 27,000,so that the overall gap between available man-power and aggregate require-ments was 239,000.6. As well as this overall shortage, the table reveals a maldistribution oflabour between industries. The expectation expressed in the 1946-47 Survey(paragraph 41), that the man-power gap would fall mainly on &quot;Group III&quot;manufacturing industries has been fulfilled, and the deficiency in these and someother industries has been aggravated by the fact that certain industries were inSeptember employing more than their Survey figures of man-power.7. Columns 4 and 5 of the table show that numbers in the Group I industries(metals, engineering and chemicals) were 57,000 more than the requirement putforward for September 1946, while other services (commerce, catering,laundries, the professions, &amp;c.) were 113,000 more,* and numbers in Governmentemployment were 94,000 more, than the figures forecast for September 1946.Hence the remaining industries, in addition to having to bear the burden of the overall man-power deficiency of 239,000, had also to cope with a shortage of194,000 arising from the larger numbers in Group I manufacturing, &quot;other services,&quot; and Government employment. As a consequence, these remainingindustries were in total some half-million short of their forecast man-power requirements.8. The industries most affected by this half-million deficiency were theGroup III manufacturing industries which employed 332,000 (or 9-7 per cent.)less than their requirements as stated, and building, which employed 110,000 (or8 -1 per cent.) less.9. The shortfalls were not evenly spread. In terms of return to pre-warnumbers, the most laggard groups were textiles, clothing and building materials.In textiles (and hence in clothing), most of the shortfall is concentrated on thecotton spinning section. The deficiency in building materials was mainly in brick-making. Part of this shortfall, however, was temporarily made good by the useof prisoners of war, the full possibilities of which had not been allowed in statingrequirements.10. The remaining deficiency of 60,000 as compared with requirements fellon agriculture and mining. Agricultural workers were 2 per cent, below require-ment at end-September (as at end-June). In mining, total labour supply isfalling increasingly below requirements, being 4-5 per cent, short at end-September compared with 3-6 per cent, at end-June. Instead of building up from 835,000 to 840,000 between June and September, as programmed, it had fallen from 806,000 to 802,000.* By contrast, numbers in distribution and in transport and public utilities were much asforecast.

Table 4 Personal Expenditure on Consumers&apos; Goods and services The figures for 1947 are based on Departmental requirements and estimates (Assumption B). As Table Dshows current trends in employment indicate that some of these requirements are most unlikely to be satisfied. Inthe crucial case of clothing and textiles, the labour force at the end of 1947 is forecast to reach only 80 per cent, ofthe combined requirements for supplies for the Forces, export and home consumption and about 80 per cent, of thetotal employed in 1938. .2 The restrictions on consumers&apos; choice, and the resulting distortion of the pattern of consumption, enforcedby shortages of such essential goods as food, clothing and durable household goods, make it impossible to provide a significant measure of the change in the total volume of consumption as compared with pre-war.3 The estimates of the volume of consumption of individual items include an inadequate allowance, and insome cases no allowance, for changes in quality (including changes in quality of goods, disappearance of pre-warservices, greater inconvenience of travelling, &amp;c).
