IS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY/S  GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1947SECRETno. 2 9CP. (47) 33(Redraft of CP. (46) 386)\8th January, 1947CABINETPROPOSAL  FOR  A   STUDY  OF   THE  POSSIBILITIES   of close ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION WITH OUR western european NEIGHBOURSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to certain problems ofeconomic relations between this country and Western Europe which call forearnest consideration. )2. By associating ourselves generally with the United States &quot; Proposalsfor Consideration by an International Conference on Trade and Employment &quot;of 6th December, 1945 (Command 6709), and by our participation in the first session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on trade and Employment held in London from 15th October to 26th November,1946, we have subscribed to a policy designed to bring about the maximum possible expansion of world trade, based upon high and sustained levels ofemployment and consumption in every country. This policy, if it can be achieved,is in the best interests of the United Kingdom as the world&apos;s principal tradingnation, and further would promote political stability in all parts of the world.3. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the plans for an expansion of multilateral trade will break down. In this event we shall need to strengthen our economic ties, not merely with the Commonwealth, but also with Western Europe.4. It is also our policy to reverse, if possible, the present trend towards the division of Europe into virtually exclusive economic blocs. But whatever results are achieved in the economic field at the forthcoming meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers in Moscow on Germany and Austria, we cannot assume that this tendency will be immediately or effectively arrested. We should beimprovident if we were not prepared for the possibility that the Eastern halfof Europe will continue to be excluded from the general free expansion of tradeand that the U.S.S.R. will seek to extend its political arid economic influence intoWestern Europe. Such an extension will be prevented only if we are prepared with measures whidh, involving close economic ties, would bind western european countries politically more closely to ourselves. The essential founda-tion of such Western solidarity would be firm economic ties between the UnitedKingdom and France. The French Government has suggested that it would liketo pursue informal discussions about the possibility of closer economic integra-tion on the basis of the Monnet Five-Year Plan. It is my belief that an examination of British and French economic plans, with a view to preventingconflicts between them, could usefully take place and would serve a valuablepolitical purpose as soon as the survey of our own economic position in 1947has been considered and has received ministerial approval, and M. Blum during his recent visit was informed accordingly.5. This in itself will not, however, be enough to secure the political objectives I have in mind if we are faced with a serious threat of further Sovieteconomic penetration. We cannot rest content with close economic association with France alone, but must also consider the position in relation to western europe as a whole.13823   [33046]
26. Nor would it be possible to proceed by gradual stages in the strengthening of our commercial relations with Western European countries, partly becausecircumstances may dictate the need for rapid and far-reaching action, andpartly because of our undertaking to the United States Government under theFinancial Agreement of December 1945, not to engage in. commercial discrimina-tiOn against United States supplies. This undertaking would rule out a gradualdeepening of Anglo-European economic co-operation by ever-increasing mutualconcessions, such as the scheme for an economic union by stages between belgium and Holland put forward in 1932, which was frustrated by the insistence of theUnited States and the United Kingdom Governments on their &quot;most-favoured-nation &quot; rights. If we are to strengthen our ties with Western Europe we maybe faced, therefore, with the necessity of taking a single plunge into a full customs union, which has always been exempted from the operation of the most-favoured-nations clause, and is expressly permitted under the United States proposal on commercial policy.7. Such a step would need the most careful consideration. It raisesgreat practical difficulties connected with the position of the Dominions, andthe status of the respective colonial empires. Moreover, for its successful workingover any length of time some measure of concerted industrial and commercialplanning with other members of the Union would be necessary. It would beimpossible, without extensive preliminary study to determine whether, in fact, on balance and in the circumstances envisaged, it would be economically of advantage to the United Kingdom. If not, the economic disadvantages would have to be weighed against the political advantages.8. I accordingly invite my colleagues to sanction, without prejudice to anyultimate decision, the most complete possible study by the departments concerned of the practicability and desirability of : (i) A full customs union;(ii) Some special economic regime, falling short of a full customs union,between :(a) The United Kingdom and Metropolitan France;lb) The United Kingdom and the French Union;(c) The United Kingdom and Western Europe as a whole, includingthe Western Zones of Germany&quot;, as occasion offered.9. I recognise the difficulties that wroulcl be involved in any degree ofeconomic union between the United Kingdom and European countries which didnot include colonial dependencies and, in our case, the Dominions as well. Mycolleagues may therefore feel that the proposed study should also look to thepossible inclusion in the customs union or special regime of colonial dependenciesand the British Dominions, including Eire.10. Such an enquiry should take into account all relevant facts and circum-stances. These will include the prerequisites and implications of any such arrangement in regard to our relations, both commercial and political, with therest of the Commonwealth and with foreign countries. It should also considerthe effect of such an arrangement on our capacity to implement our existing inter-national obligations, and in particular our recent financial agreements with canada and the United States of America.11. As regards the plans for an International Trade Organisation, the studyI propose should examine the question on three alternative assumptions(a) That the plans come into operation substantially throughout the western world;(b) That they coin6 iiiuO pa rtial operation;(c) That they fail to come into operation at all.12. The study would, of course, also have to cover the effects, favourable andunfavourable, of the customs or other economic union suggested, on our homeeconomy. In fact, it would form a kind of balance-sheet of the advantages and disadvantages, both domestic and external, of the measures suggested.13. I hope that my colleagues will see their way to agreeing that such a study, which will clearly take time, should begin at the earliest possible date andshould be pursued as a matter of urgency.E. B.Foreign Office, 18th January, 1947.
