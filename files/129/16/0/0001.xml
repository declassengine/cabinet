I attach the revised draft for consideration by mycolleagues.C.R.A.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.4th January,  1947.
INDIAN POLICYREVISED DRAFT STATEMENTI1. It has long &quot;been the policy of successive british governments to work towards the realisation of self-government in India.      In pursuance of this policy an increasing measure of responsibility has been devolvedon Indians and today the civil administration and theIndian Armed Forces rely to a very large extent on Indiancivilians and officers.      In the constitutional field the. Acts of 1919 and 1935 passed by the British Parliamenteach represented a substantial transfer of politicalpower.      In 1940 the Coalition Government recognised theprinciple that Indians should themselves -frame a newconstitution for a fully autonomous India,  and in the offer of 1942 they invited them to set up a Constituent Assemblyfor this purpose as soon as the war was over.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe this policy to havebeen right and in accordance with sound democratic principles.Since they came into office,  they have done their- utmost tocarry it forward to its fulfilment.      The declaration ofthe Prime Minister of 15th March last which met with general approval in Parliament and the country, made it clear thatit was for the Indian people themselves to choose their future status and constitution and that in the opinion ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government the time had come for responsibilityfor the government of India to pass into Indian hands.3. The Cabinet Mission which was sent to India lastyear spent over three months in consultation with indian leaders in order to help them to agree upon a method for determing the future constitution of India,  so that thetransfer of power might be smoothly and rapidly effected.It was only when it seemed clear that without someinitiative from the Cabinet Mission agreement was unlikely to be reached that they put forward proposals themselves.4. These proposals, made public in May last,  envisaged that the future constitution of India should be settled bya Constituent Assembly composed,  in the manner suggestedtherein,  of representatives of all communities and interestsin British India and .of the Indian States.5. Since the return of the Mission an interim government has been set up at the Centre composed of thepolitical leaders of the major communities and it isexercising wide powers within the existing constitution.In all the Provinces Indian Governments responsible toLegislatures are in office.
6. It is with great regret that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment find that there are still differences amongIndian politicians which are preventing the ConstituentAssembly from functioning as it was intended that itshould.      It is of the essence of the plan that the assembly should be fully representative.      The failure of Indianpoliticians, who have all expressed an eager desire to berid of British control,  to agree among themselves even onthe machinery for deciding on the constitution to replace&apos;the existing form of Government must create an unfavourableimpression on world opinion.7, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to hand over their responsibility to authorities established by a constitutionapproved by all parties in India, but unfortunately there isat present no clear prospect that such a constitution andsuch authorities will emerge.      The present state of uncertainty is fraught with danger and cannot be indefinitelyprolonged.      His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clearthat it is  their definite intention to effect the transference of power in India by a &quot;date not later than the middle of 1948.II8. For the last century peace and security have been assured to the people of this great sub-continent,  nowcontaining over four hundred million people, by theGovernment  of India under British control.      Continued peace and security.are more than ever necessary today if the fullpossibilities of economic development are to be realised anda higher standard of life attained by the Indian people.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to hand, over their responsibilities to a Government which,  resting on thesure foundation of the support of the people,  is capableof maintaining peace and administering India with justice and efficiency.      They once more urge all parties to sinktheir differences in order that they may be ready toshoulder the great responsibilities which will come upon them next year.10. But if a new constitution has not been worked outby then in accordance with the proposals made by the cabinet mission in May last, which represent the greatest measureof agreement attainable after months of hard work, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will have to consider to whom thepowers of the Central Government in British India should be handed over, whether as a whole to some form of centralGovernment for British India,  or in parts to the existingProvincial Governments, or in such other way as may seemmost reasonable and in the best interests of the Indian people.Ill11. -Although the final transfer of authority may not take place until the middle of 1948, preparatory measures mustbe put in hand in advance.&apos;    It is essential that there shouldbe no falling off in the efficiency of the civil administration and that the defence of India should be fully provided for.
But inevitably&quot;,  as the process of transfer proceeds,   itwill become progressively more difficult to carry out tothe letter all the provisions of the Government of india act 1935.;    Legislation will be introduced in due course togive effect to the final transfer of power.12. In regard to the Indian States,  as was explicitlystated by the Cabinet Mission, His Majesty&apos;s Government donot intend to hand over their powers and obligations underparamountcy to any Government of British India.      It is not intended to bring paramountcy,  as a system,  to a conclusionearlier than the date -of the final transfer of power, butit is contemplated that the relations of the Grown with individual States may be adjusted by agreement.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government will negotiate with the successor authorities agreements in regard to matters arising&apos;out of the transfer of power.14, If any members of the large European community inIndia should wish to send their families home for the timebeing,  arrangements will be made to enable them to do so.But His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that British commercial and industrial interests in India can look forward to a fairfield for their enterprise under the new conditions.      Thecommercial connection between India and the United kingdom has been long and friendly,  and Britain has a greatcontribution to make towards the development of Indianindustry.      /This hope that British commerce will flourish&apos;in the new India on a basis of goodwill and common interest is strength.ened_.by the known attitude of responsibleIndian leaders^/IV15. The association of the peoples  of Great Britainand India has achieved much in its long history that isnotable and enduring for good.      The step now announcedmarks the climax in the long period of deliberatepreparation and development which has been the dominatingfeature of this association for many years past.      When the voluntary cession of power has taken effect, and theresponsibility of the British Parliament has ceased,   thefuture of India and its success and prosperity will dependon the wisdom and statesmanship of the Indian leaders.16. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot conclude this statement without expressing on behalf of the people ofthis country their good will and good wishes towards  thepeople of India as they go forward to this final stage in their achievement of self-government.      It will be the wish of everyone in these islands that,  notwithstanding&apos;constitutional changes,  the association of the two peoplesshould not be brought to an end;    and they will wish tocontinue to do all that is in their power to further thewell-being of India.
