THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET. ./    Copy No.CP. (45) 122,18th August, 1945.CABINET.ASSISTANCE FOR LIBERATED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Minister of State.IN the course of his speech of welcome to the Council of the United NationsRelief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Foreign Secretary said : &quot; I should like to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government stand behind U.N.R.R.A.and will do everything in their power to make it a success. We shall not do this merely because this country has played a prominent part in U.N.R.R.A.affairs in the past but for obvious, practical reasons. No one in this country cancontemplate for a moment the conditions of distress and disease, of anarchy andbloodshed that will result if the liberated nations have to face the next twelvemonths without assistance.&quot; I am convinced from my contacts with people whocome from the liberated countries that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s words are all tootrue, and that the time for action before the winter begins is very short.2. I shall hope to make more comprehensive proposals for action as soonas possible. In the meantime, I invite my colleagues&apos; assistance on the following two matters : -(a) We must provide a few key personnel for U.N.R.R.A. very quickly, ifit is not. to fail.(b) Transport is the most urgent single requirement in liberated Europe,and I suggest that we should turn over to U.N.R.R.A. and to payinggovernments in Europe the maximum possible number of vehicles fromthe Armed Services. We should also provide as much clothing aspossible from supplies held for the Services against the needs of theJapanese war.3.   My reasons are as follows : (a) Personnel. The reorganisation of the European end of U.N.R.R.A.,which has been carried through by Commander Jackson, has made great improve-ments. U.N.R.R.A. has been saved from a collapse through incompetence.Jackson and his chief assistant, Colonel Katzin, have, however, worked themselvesto a standstill in the process, and both of them must be relieved at once for medicalreasons. So far, His Majesty&apos;s Government have not heen able to provide the key personnel for which Jackson asked. Now that the war is over we ought todo so without further delay.(b) Vehicles. Of all the supplies needed by liberated Europe, I believe thatvehicles should come first. All economic activity on the Continent is dependenton them and we cannot expect Europe to produce more food or distribute what it has without more transport. We ought now to be able to throw out from theServices immensely greater numbers of vehicles than we have so far contemplated.If a small committee could be set up immediately to consider and report back tothe Cabinet upon the maximum number of vehicles which could be surrenderedby the Armed Services, we would have a basis for discussion with U.N.R.R.A.and the governments concerned.12884   [30378]
I should be grateful if the Committee could be instructed - (i) to consider all the possible sources ivom which vehicles may be obtained,including both the Armed Services and the Civil Defence Services;(ii) to include not only Service vehicles on the Continent, but vehicles in service depots as well;(iii) to consider the provision not only of &quot; runners,&quot; but of &quot; non-runners &quot;as well, for repair in French, Belgian and other garages.(c) Clothing.-Many people are going to be very cold in Europe this winter,and battle dress or other Army clothing would be of tremendous value in seeingthem through. Here again there should be stocks which could now be madeavailable.   I ask that these should be similarly investigated.P. J. N. B.Foreign Office,18th August, 1945.
