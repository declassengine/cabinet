i-IIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ313TY&apos;E GOVERNMENT)7sSECRETCP. (us)   101 COPY NO.       - t&quot;CABINETMANUFACTURE OF MOSQUITO VI AIRCRAFT IN FRANCEMemorandum by the President of the -Board of TradeIn February,  1945 we told the Americans that the French,who had sent a Mission here to study the aircraft, wanted tobuild Mosquito VI aircraft,  and we asked for the AmericanGovernment&apos;s agreement in principle to this proposal.2. The Americans replied that as -(a) the proposal was in the nature of a post-war enterprise,(b) the materials required would, therefore, have to be allocated outside the military programmes (i.e.  wecould not supply the French with materials from ourlend/lease supplies),(c) French manpower could be better employed, in workdirectly connected with the European War,they could not agree to the manufacture of Mosquito VIAircraft by the French.3- Several attempts were subsequently made to get the americans to change their minds,  but without success.k* &apos;*fe ioiow that the French are still anxious to proceedwith this project,  and we thin.,; that they should be allowed todo 30; without further consultation with the Americans, forthe following reasons:-(a) there are no valid Lend/Lease or Combined Planningc omplication s,(b) the war in Europe is over and it is no longer necessaryto conserve French technicians for the repair andservicing of U.3.  aircraft,(c) France is in the Japanese War,  and(d) the Americans are  trying to  sell combat aircraft(e. g. types manufactured by Bell Aircraft Corporation)to the French without consultation with us,5. If we again ask the   ;3 tate Department whether they have any objections we- shall probably get an unsatisfactory reply.If the Americans complain that we should have consulted them,we can reply that for the reasons given above v/e did not feelthere was anything to consult them about since their previousobjections had been overtaken by events.6. I would suggest however that trie Americans should be told of what v/e are doing.R.S.C.Board of Trade,Mill-bank, S, W.1.,3th August,  19U5.
