(45) 112.14th August, 1945.CABINET.OUR OVERSEAS FINANCIAL PROSPECTS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate herewith an appreciation by Lord Keynes of &quot; Our OverseasFinancial Prospects.&quot;I am anxious that my colleagues should be informed, without delay, of thismost grim problem.   I shall shortly submit proposals for action.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th August, 1945.ANNEX.1. Three sources of financial assistance have made it possible for us to mobilise our domestic man-power for war with an intensity not approachedelsewhere, and to spend cash abroad, mainly in India and the Middle East, on a scale not even equalled by the Americans, without having to export in order topay for the food and raw materials which we were using at home or to providethe cash which we were spending abroad.2. The fact that the distribution of effort between ourselves and our Allieshas been of this character leaves us far worse off, when the sources of assistancedry up, than if the roles had been reversed. If we had been developing our exports so as to pay for our own current needs and in addition to provide a largesurplus which we could furnish free of current charge to our Allies as Lend-Leaseor Mutual Aid or on credit, we should, of course, find ourselves in a grand positionwhen the period of providing the stuff free of current charge was broughtsuddenly to an end.3. As it is, the more or less sudden drying up of these sources of assistanceshortly after the end of the Japanese war will put us in an almost desperateplight, unless some other source of temporary assistance can be found to carry usover whilst we recover our breath a plight far worse than most people, even inGovernment Departments, have yet appreciated.4.   The three sources of financial assistance have been (d\ Lend-Lease from the United States;(b) Mutual Aid from Canada;(c) Credits (supplemented by sales of our pre-war capital assets) from the sterling Area (including credits under Payments Agreements withcertain countries, especially in South America, which are outside theArea, but have made special agreements with it).5.   In the present year, 1945, these sources are enabling us to overspend ourown income at the rate of about  2,100 millions a year, made up roughly asfollows (these figures were compiled on the assumption that Lend-Lease and[30349] copy No.t)
Mutual Aid would continue on the basis&apos; of recent provisions until the endof 1945) :-  millions.Lend-Lease (munitions)..........       600Lend-Lease (non-munitions)......      ...        500Canadian Mutual Aid        ......      ..,        250Sterling Area, &amp;c    ...      .........        7502,100(The Mutual Aid, amounting recently to about  500 millions a year, whichwe ourselves are according is here treated as part of our own domesticexpenditure. From some, but not all, points of view this should be deducted fromthe above.)6. This vast, but temporary, assistance allows us for the time being toover-play our own financial hand by just that amount. It means, conversely,that others are under-playing their hands correspondingly. How vividly doDepartments and Ministers realise that the gay and successful fashion in whichwe undertake liabilities all over the world and slop money out to the importunaterepresents an over-playing of our hand, the possibility of which will come to anend quite suddenly and in the near future unless we obtain a new source ofassistance? It may be that we are doing some things which are useless if wehave to abandon them shortly after V-J, and that our external policies are very far from being adjusted to impending realities.7.   To sum up, the overseas balance in 1945 is estimated as follows :   million-Exports ...      .........     350Net invisible income and sundryrepayments, &amp;c.      ...      ....     100Government receipts from united States and Dominionsfor their forces and munitions     350Total income overseas    ...     800Deficit ....      ...   2,1002,900These estimates have been compiled on the assumption of a continuanceof the Japanese war and Lend-Lease to the end of 1945. But the early termina-tion of the Japanese war is likely to reduce Lend-Lease aid by more than it reducesour expenditure; so that, apart from some new sources of aid, the financialposition is more likely to be worsened than improved in the short run.8. What happens on the morrow of V-J day? We are led to expect thatLend-Lease and Mutual Aid (amounting this year to  1,350 millions altogether)will cease almost immediately. The Sterling Area arrangements in more or lesstheir present form are, we hope, rather more durable, but they will become increasingly less productive of finance as supplies and shipping become available,and before long will become a burden instead of an aid for the credits in our favour accrued on account of its being physically impossible for the Sterling area countries to spend what they have been induced to lend us. I shall assume below that we can continue to expect substantial aid from the Sterling Area for a year after V-J, but no longer. We also have fair assurance of some subsequentassistance from Canada.9. On the other hand, certain sources of expenditure will also dry up almost immediately, more particularly the munitions which we are obtaining from north america under Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid. We shall no longer need them andwe are entitled to cease taking them. This will save.us expenditure which isrunning currently at the rate of about  850 millions a year.Nothing else will cease automatically or immediately on the morrow ofV-J day. But there will, of course, be a further substantial economy in Govern-ment expenditure overseas which can be obtained more slowly, say in the courseof a year. There is likely, however, to be a considerable time-lag in reducing such expenditure, for three reasons.   In the first place, bills for much of the expenditureImports excl. munitions       ...   1,250Munitions received under Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid      ...     850Other Government expenditure overseas        ...      ...      ....     800Total expenditure overseas   2,900
are received considerably in arrear, and we are responsible in India and Australia(as we are not in the case of Lend-Lease supplies) for winding up our munitioncontracts just as at home. In the second place the withdrawal of our forces willbe protracted on account both of lack of transport and of the slowness of theadministrative machine. In the third place (and above all) a substantial part ofour existing Government expenditure overseas has no direct or obvious connectionwith the Japanese war and will not, therefore, come to an end merely because theJaps have packed up; retrenchment in these other directions will require quite aseparate set of Cabinet decisions. Merely as a personal judgment, based on ageneral knowledge of the break-down of the expenditure in question, I shouldguess that without any change in policy good and energetic management might bring down the annual rate of  800 millions to (say)  300 millions by the end of1946, although the cost during that year as a whole may be not much less than 450 millions. Any further substantial reduction will require drastic revisionsof policy of a kind which do not automatically ensue on V-J.10. Unfortunately there are also certain items of income which arise out ofthe war and will fade away with it. In reckoning the current overseas balance,credit has been taken (see S7) for income of  350 millions a year arising partlyout of the personal expenditure of the American forces in this country ( 115millions in 1944 and probably as much as  60 millions in 1945) and mainly out ofthe contributions made by the Dominions towards the equipment and maintenanceof their own divisions which has been provided by us in the first instance. Thesesources of income will have disappeared almost entirely within a year of V-J, but,allowing for time-lags in meeting old bills, and for possible repayments from theNorth-Western European Allies, they may amount, on optimistic assumptions, toas much as  150 millions during that year.11. We must next allow for possible economies after V-J in other overseas expenditure for goods and for increased earnings from our shipping and from theexpansion of our exports in 1946. To correct for these factors we have to embark on difficult guesswork, and the range of reasonable estimating is very wide.12. In the cost of imports of food and raw material an increase, rather thana reduction, is in sight, if the public are to be fed reasonably and employed fully and taking account of the fact that stocks are being currently drawn upon. Weare budgeting (unless circumstances force us to restrict, as is quite possible) for more rather than less food in 1946 than in 1945. The raw materials required toprovide employment, though not always the same in character as those we nowimport, are unlikely to be reduced in aggregate, since the numbers to be employedin industry will, after demobilisation, be more rather than less. On the otherhand, some miscellaneous economies should be possible. One way and another our import programme might be kept down to  1,300 millions. Even this, assumingprices at double pre-war, means considerable austerity. For our pre-war imports were  850 millions, that is (say)  1,700 millions at the assumed post-war price level. Thus the above figure assumes a reduction of 23 per cent, below the volumeof our pre-war imports and therefore presumes strict controls, in the absence ofwhich an appreciably higher figure is to be expected as soon as supplies areavailable.13. As for exports there seems a reasonable hope of increasing them froman aggregate of  350 millions in 1945 to  600 millions in 1946. Extreme energy and concentration on this objective should do better still. Net invisible income in1946, allowing for some recovery in commercial shipping receipts, might be put at 50 millions.14. On the assumption of an export and import price level double pre-war,and no major changes in present policies, the position in 1946 can, therefore, be summed up as follows :   millions.Imports        ...       ...       -..    1,300Government       expenditure overseas    ..        ...       ...      4501,750Exports        ......... 600Net invisible income ... 50Government   receipts   fromAllies and Dominions    ... 150800Deficit.........      950r30349]1,750b 2
15. When we come to subsequent years, we are in the realm of pure guess-work. If, to cheer ourselves up, we make bold to assume that by 1949 we havereached the goal of increasing the volume of exports by 50 per cent., the value of exports in that year, at double pre-war prices, would be  1,450 millions. If wesuppose further that we can keep the further growth of imports within verymoderate limits, if we can steadily curtail Government expenditure overseas, andif we can steadily increase our net invisible income, we can produce the followingpipe-dream, showing an eventual equilibrium in the fourth year after V-J, namely1949 :-(  millions.)-	Imports.	Government Expenditure Overseas.	Total.	Exports..	Net Invisible Income.	Total.	Deficit.1947   ...       ... 1948   ...... 1949......	1,400 1,400 1,450	250 200 150	1,650 1,600 1,600	1,000 1,300 1,450	100 100 150	1,100 1,400 1,600	550 200 NilIt should be emphasised that imports can be kept down to this figure only by strictregulation.16. Combining the above assumed deficits in 1947 and 1948 with theestimated deficit of  950 millions in 1946, we have a total deficit of  1,700 millions for the three years taken together.17. Where, on earth, is all this money to come from? Our gold and dollar reserves at the end of 1945 will stand at about  500 millions. We might, ifnecessary, draw on this to the tune of  250 millions but certainly not more. In1946 we might conceivably increase our net borrowing from the Sterling Area by(say) another  300 millions by stipulating that the further expenses in thosecountries strictly arising out of the war should be added to the War Debts. Butthere will be chaos in the trade relations of the Sterling Area and a break-down of the whole system unless we are prepared to release at least  75 millions a yearto these and our other creditors in each of the years 1947 and 1948, leaving a netgain of  150 millions over the period as a whole. These two sources togetherbring the cumulative deficit down to  1,250 millions, i.e., $5 billions.18. The conclusion is inescapable that there is no source from which wecan raise sufficient funds to enable us to live and spend on the scale we contemplate except the United States. It is true that there are sundry resources which have not been taken into account in the above. For example, we still have some capital assets which could be gradually realised; and we have anexpectation of some further aid from Canada. But the above calculationassumes that we have reached equilibrium by the end of 1948 which we haveno convincing reason to expect, and also that we have by that date drawn downour ultimate reserves to the minimum. Moreover, the reader may have noticed that I have almost altogether omitted any reference to the vast debt of between 3,000 and  4,000 millions which we shall be owing to almost every countryin the world. In other words, it has been tacitly assumed that we have foundsome way of dealing with this which allows us to discharge nothing in thethree years 1946-1948 taken together and, in fact, to add  150 millions to it.Moreover, the assumed rate of growth of exports is wildly optimistic, unlessour methods change considerably. The conclusion holds, therefore, in so far as any firm conclusion can be based on such precarious material, that -there remainsa deficit of the order of f 5 billions which can be met from no other source butthe United States.19. It is sometimes suggested that we can avoid dependence on the UnitedStates by a system of semi-barter arrangements with the countries from whichwe buy. This, however, assumes that the limiting factor lies in the willingness of overseas markets to take our goods. Whatever may be the truth a few yearshence, this will not be the position in the early post-war period which we have in view here. The limiting factor will be our physical capacity to develop asufficient supply of export goods. Barter arrangements assume that we havegoods to oftWin exchange; and that is precisely what, we shall lack in the next two years.   At present the boot is on, and pinching, the other leg-the countries
from which we buy are trying to make their sales to us contingent on ouraccepting barter terms, under which we supply goods which they want but whichwe unfortunately are unable to provide. .20. What it does lie in our power to do in mitigation falls under twoheadings. Even to attain the assumed expansion of exports, and certainly ifwe are to improve on it, we must stop forthwith making munitions which are notwanted and reconvert industry to peace-time production at a much greater pacethan is at present in view. Hitherto, the assumed continuance of the japanese war until the end of 1946 has provided a magnificent camouflage for carryingon as though the end of the German war did not make all that difference. Tosuggest acting on the assumption that we might beat the Japs before 1947 hasbeen regarded by all the major-generals as a brand of defeatism. Perhaps thetime has now come when we can reconvert ruthlessly and with no regard to any-thing but speed and economy. It is not sensible either to keep men idle at theworks or to use up valuable raw materials on producing useless objects merely to avoid statistical unemployment.21. The second heading probably presents much greater difficulty. we still have a vast number of men in the three Services overseas, and the Govern-ment cash expenditure outside this country, which this involves, is still costingmore than the value of our total exports. It might be supposed that the defeat of Japan would bring most of this rapidly to an end, subject, of course, to the inevitable time-lags. Unfortunately, that is a long way from the truth. Outof the  425 millions cost of the Services overseas in the current year the South-East Asia Command is responsible for only  100 millions. We have got intothe habit of maintaining large and expensive establishments all over theMediterranean, Africa and Asia to cover communications, to provide reservesfor unnamed contingencies and to police vast areas eastwards from Tunis to burma and northwards from East Africa to Germany. None of these establish-ments will disappear unless and until they are ordered home; and many of them have pretexts for existence which have nothing to do with Japan. Furthermore,we are still making loans to Allies and are incurring very large liabilities for relief out of money we have not got.22. Broken up broadly between purposes, I believe that the 1945 expenditureoutside North America is distributed as follows : *  millions.The Services ..................    .425War Supplies and Munitions (mainly India, SouthAfrica and Australia)       ...      ...      ...      ...      300Reciprocal  Aid,  Loans  to  Allies,  Relief,   ForeignOffice, &amp;c..........       ...      ...      -..        75800Of this total about  450 millions was incurred in the first half of the year before V-E and  350 millions was expected in the second half after V-E. Theeffect of V-J on the rate of expenditure in the last quarter of 1945 has not yet been estimated.23. Broken up between areas, the expenditure of  725 millions on theServices and War Supplies is made up broadly as follows :   millions.India, Burma and CeylonMiddle East        ...      .............South Africa, Australia and New ZealandBritish Western, British Eastern and Central AfricaMalta and Cyprus...       ...      ...       ...Europe       ...      ...       ...      ...      ...      .:.Other ..................72524. To an innocent observer in the Treasury very early and very drasticeconomies in this huge cash expenditure overseas seem an absolute condition ofmaintaining our solvency. There is no possibility of our obtaining from othersfor more than a brief period the means of maintaining any significant part ofthese establishments, in addition to what we shall require to meet our runningexcess of imports over exports and to sustain the financial system of the Sterling41011011020104025
Area. These are burdens which there is no reasonable expectation of our being able to carry. Yet there are substantial items within the  800 millions whichwill not be automatically cut out merely as a result of the defeat of Japan.25. Even assuming a fair measure of success in rapidly expanding exports and curtailing Government expenditure overseas, it still remains that aid of theorder of $5 billions is required from the United States. We have reason to believethat those members of the American Administration who are in touch with our financial position are already aware that we shall &apos;be in Queer Street without aid of somewhere between $3 and $5 billions and contemplate aid on this&apos; scale as not outside practical politics. But this does not mean that difficult and awkwardproblems of terms and conditions do not remain to be solved. The chief pointslikely to arise are the following : (i) They will wish the assistance to be described as a credit. If this meanspayment of interest and stipulated terms of repayment, it is somethingwe cannot undertake in addition to our existing obligations with any confidence that we can fulfil the obligations. It would be a repetition of what happened after the last war and a cause of further humilia-tion and Anglo-American friction, which we should firmly resist. If,however, the term credit is no more than a camouflage for what wouldbe in effect a grant-in-aid, that is another matter,(ii) The Americans will almost certainly insist upon our acceptance of amonetary and commercial foreign policy along the general lines onwhich they have set their hearts. But it is possible that they will exercise moderation and will not overlook the impropriety of usingfinancial pressure on us to make us submit to what we believe is toour grave disadvantage. In fact the most persuasive argument wecan use for obtaining the desired aid is that only by this means will itlie within our power to enter into international co-operation in theeconomic field on the general principle of non-discrimination. Weshould not seek to escape our obligations under Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement, but should, rather, ask for the material basiswithout which it will not lie in our power to fulfil them. In myopinion we need not despair of obtaining an agreement which providessufficient safeguards and will not seriously hamper the future develop-ment of our economy along lines freely determined by our own policies,(iii) Bases, islands, air facilities and the like may conceivably come into the picture.26. Nor must we build too much on the sympathy and knowledge of themembers of the American Administration with whom we are in touch. It willbe a tough proposition, perhaps an impossible one, to sell a sufficiently satisfactoryplan to Congress and the American people who are unacquainted with, and arenever likely to understand, the true force of our case, not only in our own interestsbut in the interests of the United States and the whole world. For the time beingMinisters would do well to assume that no arrangement which we can properlyaccept is yet in sight; and that, until such an arrangement is in sight, we are.with the imminent cessation of Lend-Lease, virtually bankrupt, and the economic basis for the hopes of the public non-existent.27. It seems, then, that there are three essential conditions without whichwe have not a hope of escaping what might be described, without exaggerationand without implying that we should not eventually recover from it, a financialDunkirk. These conditions are (a) an intense concentration on the expansion of exports, (&amp;) drastic and immediate economies in our overseas expenditure, and(c) substantial aid from the United States on terms which we can accept. Theycan only be fulfilled by a combination of the greatest enterprise, ruthlessnessand tact.28. What does one mean in this context by &quot; a financial Dunkirk &quot; 1 Whatwould happen in the event of insufficient success ? That is not easily foreseen.Abroad it would require a sudden and humiliating withdrawal from our onerousresponsibilities with great loss of prestige and an acceptance for the time being of the position of a second-class Power, rather like the present position of France.From the Dominions and elsewhere we should seek what charity we could obtain.At home a- greater degree of austerity would be necessary than we have experienced at any time during the war. And there would have to be an indefinitepostponement of the realisation of the best hopes of the hew Government. It isprobable that after five years the difficulties would have been largely &quot;overcome.
29. But in practice one will be surprised if it ever comes to this. Inpractice, of course, we shall in the end accept the best terms we can get. Andthat may be the beginning of later trouble and bitter feelings. That is why it is so important to grasp the reality of our position and to mitigate its potentialitiesby energy, ingenuity and foresight.30. Shortage of material goods is not going to be the real problem of thepost-war world for more than a brief period. Beyond question we are entering into the age of abundance. All the more reason not to mess things up and endanger the prizes of victory and the fruits of peace whilst crossing the thresholdThe time may well come and sooner than we yet have any right to assume-when the sums which now overwhelm us may seem chicken-feed, and an oppor-tunity to get rid of stuff without payment a positive convenience.KEYNES.13th August, 1945.
