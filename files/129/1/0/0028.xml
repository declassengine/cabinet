Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 128.27th August, 1945.CABINET.ACCOMMODATION  FOR  PRISONERS  OF  WAR.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.1. The programme for the large-scale use of German prisoners for labouringwork, including the preparation of housing sites, is placed in jeopardy by accom-modation difficulties and cannot be carried out unless the provision of accommodation for prisoners is given a priority and a serious effort is made bythe Departments concerned to settle competing claims to accommodation in sucha way as to leave for prisoners a net-work of camps, airfields or hostels,conveniently situated for the work they will have to do.2. Large parts of the country are out of reach of prisoner labour at presentand what is needed is a convenient distribution of prisoners so that their labourcan be used effectively in the various districts. The best arrangement is to houseprisoners at a military camp or airfield provided by a Service Department within reach of the work they are to do. At such a camp or airfield living accommoda-tion is already in existence and there is no delay in getting the prisoners towork. It might also be possible to use some of the Miners&apos; Hostels erected forthe Ministry of Fuel and Power. The only alternative, unless, we are to eon-template the requisitioning of houses, &amp;o, for prisoners, is to provide new campsfor them, mainly tented camps, provided the supply of tents is adequate.3.   I therefore propose-(1) that the accommodation of prisoners of war be accorded a priority;(2) that a Committee representative of the Service and Supply Departments,the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Ministry of Works shouldbe appointed and instructed to frame a scheme for the settlement of competing claims to accommodation in such a way as to make avail-able for prisoners a net-work of camps, airfields, hostels, &amp;c., as con-veniently situated as possible for the work they will have to do;(3) that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works should be chairman of the Committee.G. T.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,27th August, 1945.[30401]
