THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET. - Copy No.CP. (45) 111.lA.th August, 1945.CABINET.SUPPLIES AND SERVICES (TRANSITIONAL POWERS) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. I desire the authority of the Cabinet for the introduction of the supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill in the form of the draft attached to thismemorandum. The Bill will be submitted to the Legislation Committee for the examination of its detailed provisions.2. A Bill in similar terms was introduced by the Coalition Government inMay last, but the Caretaker Government did not afford facilities for its passage into law. Instead, in July last, they secured parliamentary authority for thecontinuance of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts for six months instead ofa year and proposed that the future form of emergency legislation, including theEmergency Powers &apos;(Defence) Acts and the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill, should be reviewed in the autumn after the Election.3. The Bill makes it possible to keep in being during the transitional periodexisting Defence Regulations of an economic character. Save in respect of price control, the Bill gives no power to add to the number of defence regulations, though there is power to amend existing Regulations.4. The Bill extends the control exercised by Parliament over subordinateOrders and other instruments of a legislative character made under defence regulations.5. The present draft covers a wider field than the Bill introduced by the coalition Government in two respects :- (a) There is a fresh clause (Clause 2) which enables Defence Regulations tobe made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts for controllingprices. This wide power of price control will facilitate the workof Departments in checking inflation and will be of assistance inchecking restrictive practices in industry, until comprehensivelegislation on that subject can be introduced.(b) The Defence (Finance) Regulations relating to exchange control and thecontrol of capital issues are covered by the Bill. This, if theChancellor of the Exchequer so wishes, will give more time for theintroduction of legislation of a permanent character on that subject.6. The Bill, as drafted, lasts for two years and thereafter can only be renewed from year to year by Addresses from eachLlouse. It is for consideration whether the original duration of the Bill should not be extended from two to three, or even five, years.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,14:th August, 1945.[30348]
