Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.Copy No.   cKOCP. (45) 133.2Uh August, 1945.CABINET.POLICY IN REGARD TO MALAYA AND BORNEO.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. -AT their meeting on the 31st May, 1944,* the War Cabinet gave provisional approval to certain proposals regarding the future policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Malaya and Borneo. These proposals had been formulated by a ministerial Committee appointed for the purpose, and the Committee&apos;s report was circulated to the War Cabinet on the 1.8th May, 1944, under the numberW.P. (44) 258.   A copy of the report forms the Annex to this paper.2. As regards Malaya, the Committee expressed the view that the restorationof the pre-war constitutional and administrative system would be undesirable inthe interests of efficiency and security, and of our declared purpose of promotingself-government in Colonial territories. The Committee went on to point out thatHis Majesty has at present no jurisdiction in the Malay States, and that hisrelations with the States rest upon treaties with the individual Rulers, underwhich the Rulers remain nominally independent, though bound to accept Britishadvice on all matters except Mohammedan religion and Malay custom. As a necessary preliminary to all further changes in Malaya, the Committee recom-mended that fresh Treaties should be made with each of the Rulers, under which such jurisdiction would be ceded to His Majesty as would enable him to legislate for the States under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. Thereafter an Order-in-Council would be made which would provide for the future central and localgovernment of the country. There would be established a Malayan Union with a central legislature; a Malayan Union Citizenship would also be created, whichwould not be confined to the Malays, but would be open to persons of whateverrace, who may have been born in the country or who have genuinely adoptedMalaya as their home. Thus the existing racial and parochial barriers would be broken down.3. The Committee went on to recommend that the British Settlements ofPenang and Malacca (at present part of the Colony of the Straits Settlements)should be incorporated in the Malayan Union, but that Singapore should for thetime being (and without prejudice to the possibility of later amalgamation withthe Malayan Union) be administered as a separate Colony under a separateGovernor. Finally, the Committee envisaged that there should be appointed a&quot; Governor-General,&quot; who would reside at Singapore and who would have thepower of control not only over the Governor of the Malayan Union and theGovernor of Singapore, but also over British Representatives in Borneo.4. War Cabinet approval for these proposals was only given provisionallyand for planning purposes. Plans have now been proceeding on this basis for over a year, and Sir Harold MacMichael, until recently High Commissioner forPalestine, has been provisionally selected as the special Representative of FlisMajesty&apos;s Government who &quot;will go out to Malaya to conclude the new treaties with the Malay Rulers. Sir Harold has already paid a preliminary visit to Indiaand S.E.A.C., and has thoroughly acquainted himself with the whole subject.5. It has been strongly represented to me by Admiral Mountbatten that a proper reception of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy in Malaya and elsewheredepends upon  its  timely publication in advance.     I find much  force  in* W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions.[30408]b
Admiral Mountbatten&apos;s arguments, but I am not in a position to make any recom-mendation as to publication or policy so long as the proposed policy has merelyreceived the provisional approval of the Cabinet, and that only for the confidentialguidance of planners.6. I am aware that we cannot fully gauge the temper of the people in Malayauntil our return has been actually effected, and that a final decision on all the detailsof our future policy is therefore not yet possible. I am convinced, however, thatthe initial step of negotiating new Treaties with the Malay Rulers must be taken as soon as possible, and that any delay on this cardinal point, particularly if itwere to involve a return to the state of affairs existing before the Japanese occupa-tion of Malaya, might result in the loss of a unique opportunity for setting theterritory on the road to political progress.7. Accordingly I now seek the definite confirmation by my colleagues of thepolicy outlined above, and approval for Sir Harold MacMichael&apos;s appointment. Iconsider it essential that he should depart for the Far East in the very near future.If the policy is now confirmed, I shall make a separate recommendation as soonas possible regarding the question of publicity.8. As regards Borneo, the Ministerial Committee, as in the case of Malaya,reached the conclusion that the restoration of the pre-war constitutional andadministrative system in the four territories involved would be undesirable inthe interests of security, and of our declared purpose of promoting social, economicand political progress in Colonial territories. The territories in question are theState of North Borneo, at present (as regards its internal affairs) under theindependent administration of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company,the small Island of Labuan, at present administered as one of the straits settlements, the State of Brunei, which is ruled by a Malay Sultan on the same lines as the nine States in the Malay Peninsula, and Sarawak, which (as regardsits internal affairs) is under the control of an independent white Rajah of british nationality (Sir Vyner Brooke). The Committee recommended the direct assump-tion by His Majesty&apos;s Government of responsibility for administration in north borneo, the integration of Labuan with North Borneo and the cession to HisMajesty of full jurisdiction in Brunei and Sarawak. In the case of Sarawak,the Committee recommended that the new Treaty providing for this cession of jurisdiction should also secure the acceptance by the Rajah of a Resident BritishAdviser, whose advice must be sought and acted upon in all substantial mattersof policy and administration. (The present Treaty with Brunei already providesfor a Resident British Adviser).9. In approving the above recommendations of the Committee, the WarCabinet authorised my predecessor to open confidential negotiations with theBritish North Borneo (Chartered) Company for the transfer of their sovereignand administrative rights over North Borneo to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Nofinancial commitment, however, was to be entered into without further authorisation-tion. The War Cabinet also authorised my predecessor to open confidential discussions with the Rajah of Sarawak.10. Discussions with the North Borneo Company have in fact been proceed-ing since that date, but I am not at present asking for a Cabinet decision, since i am awaiting from the Company&apos;s Representatives an expression of their view on the terms upon which a settlement by arbitration might be based.11. As regards Sarawak, the Rajah has shown considerable reluctance toenter into any discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to con-cluding a fresh Agreement. After many delays, he represented that, owing tothe impossibility of consulting his people, he was not in a position to enter intoa new engagement. My predecessor agreed, therefore, that discussions should befor the purpose of coming to an understanding on the terms of a new agreement which, when the time came, the Rajah would be prepared to recommend for acceptance and which would be implemented in accordance with the appropriateprocedure of the Sarawak Government. The Rajah, however, was still hesitantand by October last progress had only reached the point of securing his consent to consider a note of His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals.12. In November, however, the Rajah decided to reinstate his nephew,Mr. Anthony Brooke, as Rajah Muda (a step which can be taken to mean thathe must be regarded as heir-presumptive), and suggested that he should take partin the proposed discussions, which eventually began in March.
1        13.   The Rajah Muda and the two other members of the Sarawak Com-! mission nominated by the Rajah to represent him have shown themselves opposedI to the proposals which have been made to them on the basis of the decision of theI War Cabinet and since the fourth meeting, which was held on the 10th May,a state of stalemate has existed, while the Sarawak Government consult their;1 legal ^ adviser on His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s definition of the international1 position of Sarawak.   My predecessor, therefore, wrote to the Rajah in July requesting that active consideration should be given to the measures which werejl necessary on the Sarawak side for the resumption of discussions.   The Rajahreplied that the Rajah Muda was now administering the Government and that inaccordance with the terms of the Sarawak Constitution, Colonel Stanley&apos;s letterhad been passed to him for action.   Nothing further has been heard from thej Sarawak side.14. The Rajah Muda and members of the Sarawak Government have fromtime to time expressed the wish that Civil Government in Sarawak should be restored as soon as possible, and that the Rajah Muda, as a member of the Brookefamily administering the Government, should be allowed to return to the country during the period of military administration.15. I propose that I should now be authorised to tell the Rajah that therelations with His Majesty&apos;s Government are governed by the Agreements of1888 and 1941, and that so long as he remains Rajah His Majesty&apos;s government cannot recognise any claim on his part to devolve his powers and prerogativesas Rajah on to an &quot; Officer Administering the Government &quot; or any other person.In this connection it is to be observed that Section 18 (ii) of the Order of 1941(providing for the future government of Sarawak) which enacts that &apos;&apos; In theevent of the Rajah having occasion to leave the State or to be temporarily absentfrom the seat of Government the Rajah in Council may appoint an officer toI administer the Government and such officer shall forthwith assume all the powersand prerogatives of the Rajah (subject to the provisions of this Order) &quot; haslocal application only, and does not apply to the present position where the Rajahis in this country and capable of negotiating with His Majesty&apos;s Government.16. I should further propose to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government look tothe Rajah to ensure that an agreement satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis reached within a period of two months and that, failing the conclusion ofsuch an agreement within that time, it will be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to consider what course they must take to ensure that they are in a positionand have the necessary authority in the internal as well as the external policies1 of the Sarawak administration to carry out the responsibility for the territory which they bear to the British Parliament and in the international field. Ishould like to have authority to add that there can be no question of the Rajahor his Government being permitted to return to Sarawak until such arrangements as are satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government have been made.17.   The proposed future changes in the status of Labuan and Brunei arcof comparatively minor importance, and need, I think, present no difficulties.I should, nevertheless, be- grateful if my colleagues could now give their final approval to the proposals as regards these territories which were considered by1 the War Cabinet on the 31st May last year.18. To sum up, I request the approval of my colleagues for the following measures : (a) the definite confirmation of the policy as regards Malaya which is described in paragraphs 2 and 3 above;&apos; the first step towards the implementation of this policy being the definitive appointment ofSir Harold MacMichael and his visit to Malaya to conclude newtreaties with the Rulers of the several States;(b) a communication to the Rajah of Sarawak in the sense indicated rnparagraphs 15 and 16 above;(c) the proposed changes in the administration of Labuan and in the matterof His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction in Brunei.G.

ANNEX.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.WE were appointed by the War Cabinet at its meeting on the 6th January(W.M. (44) 2nd Conclusions) to consider the question of the constitutional policies to be followed in Malaya and in the British territories in Borneo on their liberation, and to recommend a directive on which the authorities responsible for planning the Civil Administration of these territories after liberation can work.The composition of the Committee was as follows : The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for War.The Attorney-General.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.2. Malaya. A directive on the probable lines of future policy is indis-pensable for those who have the duty of planning the Civil Affairs policies andas a basis for the directive to be issued in due course on these matters to theSupreme Allied Commander, S.E.A.C.; and, on the understanding that no publicity is given to the policies contained therein, we are in agreement on theterms of the directive for this purpose, which form Appendix I to this report.3. Borneo.-The four British territories concerned (North Borneo, Sarawak,Labuan and Brunei) are at present in a United States sphere of command, theS.W. Pacific. His Majesty&apos;s Government are entitled, under the terms of the charter of the Combined Civil Affairs Committee, to provide the AmericanCommander with directives on Civil Affairs policies in these British territories,and a directive on Civil Affairs will need to be framed at the appropriate timefor issue to him. But it is not our function to examine the form in which anysuch directive for that purpose will need to be framed. We have concernedourselves only with a directive on which the British planning staff should work.For this limited purpose we have agreed upon a directive in the terms of appendix II to this report.4. It will be noted that the Borneo directive proposes the acquisition byHis Majesty&apos;s Government from the British North Borneo (Chartered) company of its sovereign and administrative rights in North Borneo. We are of opinionthat confidential discussion for this purpose should be opened with the Courtof Directors of the Chartered Company, though we recognise that in the presentuncertain position as to the value of the Chartered Company&apos;s assets in the far east it would be premature to reach any agreement on the financial terms on which such a settlement could be reached.5. In the case of the Borneo directive, as in that of the Malayan, there isno question of any publicity being given to the policies beyond the confidential discussions which will be involved with the Chartered Company and the Rajahof Sarawak.6. To sum up, we accordingly recommend, with the proviso that no publicity for these policies is involved, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies beauthorised -(a) To issue the directive at Appendix I to the authorities responsible for planning for the Civil Administration of Malaya on liberation;(b) To issue the directive at Appendix II to the British officials at presentplanning for Civil Administration in British Borneo after liberation;(c) To Open confidential discussions with the Court of Directors of the british north Borneo (Chartered) Company with a view to coming to an understanding -(without at this stage any financial commitment) asto the conditions on which the administration of North Borneo wouldbe transferred from the Company&apos;s responsibility and control to thatof His Majesty&apos;s Government; and)
(d) To open confidential discussions, with the Rajah of Sarawak, who is atpresent residing in this country, with a view to the preparation ofa new Agreement on the lines proposed in paragraph 3 (c) of appendix II attached.(On behalf of the Committee),(Signed) C. R. ATTLEE.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th May, 1944.APPENDIX I.Draft Directive on Policy- in Malaya.j 1.. The restoration of the pre-war constitutional and administrative system will be undesirable in the interests of efficiency and security and of our declaredpurpose of promoting self-government in Colonial territories. The first of these interests requires a closer union of the territories comprising the relatively smallarea of the Malay Peninsula; and the second requires that self-government shouldnot merely develop towards a system of autocratic rule by the Malay Rulers but should provide for a growing participation in the Government by the people of allthe communities in Malaya, subject to a special recognition of the political,economic and social interests of the Malay race.2. On general grounds, and more particularly in order that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may be in a better position to ensure the development of the country on the lines indicated above, it is necessary that the old position in which HisMajesty had no jurisdiction in the Malay States should be remedied and thatit should be possible to legislate for those States under the Foreign JurisdictionAct. Immediately on the reoccupation of Malaya, direct authority will beexercised by the Military Commander, who will carry with him sufficient authorityto enable him to exercise such direct powers and control over the territory as willbe necessary during the period of military administration. This military authority will, however, not enable His Majesty to legislate for the Malay states under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act and, moreover, the jurisdiction of theMilitary Commander will not persist when the military administration gives wayto a permanent civil administration.3. In considering the proper way to achieve these objects, it is necessary,on the one hand, to make certain basic assumptions and, on the other hand, to beprepared to meet a situation when the liberation of Malaya has been effected, onwhich those assumptions may be found to be wrong or incomplete and inconsequence the prepared plans may have to be varied. The future position and status of the Malay Rulers in particular cannot finally be judged before liberationwhen it will be possible to assess not only their individual records but also andespecially the attitude of the people of Malaya to the advantages or otherwise of maintaining the Sultanates as institutions in the several States. For thepresent we have no reason for any other assumption than that the Sultanates asan institution will continue to enjoy the loyalty and traditional respect of the malays.4. On that assumption, it is considered that the proper way to achieve our purpose will be to make fresh treaties with the Rulers under which suchjurisdiction would be ceded to His Majesty as would enable him to legislate forthe States under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, A fresh Treaty with each Rulershould for this single purpose be concluded on behalf of His Majesty as soon asfeasible after reoccupation. The actual signatory of such Treaties on behalfof His Majesty would appropriately be the G.O.C., but the negotiations wouldbe carried on under instructions from the Secretary of State for the Colonies by civil Affairs Officers or special representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government,subject always to the proviso that the actual time for opening negotiations withthe Rulers must be governed by Military exigencies and left to the discretion ofthe Military Commander.5. The acquisition of this Jurisdiction by His Majesty will enable anOrder-in-Council to be made to provide for the future central and. local govern-rnent of the country.   This jurisdiction will render unnecessary any further
dependence on Treaties with Rulers in any future revision of the constitutional arrangements.6. The new constitutional arrangements for Malaya should provide for thespecial treatment of the port and Island of Singapore, m the early stages at anyrate, in view of its distinctive characteristics in the Malayan picture.7. The rest of the peninsula, including the British Settlements of Penangand Malacca, should be constituted a Malayan Union. For the Malayan unions constitution should be devised which would provide for a single united authorityrepresenting the States and the Settlements, subject to the jurisdiction of HisMajesty under statutory powers. At the head of the Union Government wouldbe a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. The seat of this government would conveniently be in or near Kuala Lumpur.8. The co-ordination and direction of the policies of Government in the malayan Union and Singapore will be secured by the appointment of a&quot;Governor-General&quot; at Singapore, with the power of control over the localAuthorities in Malaya and Borneo.9. Co-operation in all administrative matters requisite between singapore and the Union will be ensured by particular agreements for joint consultation and action.10. On the assumption explained in paragraph 3 it will be no part of thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Malay Rulers should lose their personal position in their State territories. Indeed, it will be the intention, that,by the association of their territories in the Union, the Rulers will have oppor-tunities to take part in wider activities than hitherto for the general advantageof the country as a whole, and may thereby enhance their sphere of influence and prestige in Malaya.APPENDIX II.Draft Directive on Policy Borneo.(North Borneo, Labuan, Brunei and Sarawak.)1. The restoration of the pre-war constitutional and administrative systemsin the four territories will be undesirable in the interests of security and of ourdeclared purpose of promoting social, economic and political progress in colonial territories.These purposes require (a) The direct assumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of responsibility for administration in North Borneo.(b) The integration of Labuan with North Borneo.(c) The cession to His Majesty of full jurisdiction in Brunei and Sarawak.The purpose of political progress requires also that self-government in Bruneiand Sarawak should not merely develop towards systems of autocratic rule but should provide for a growing participation in the Government by people of all communities in each territory.2. On general grounds, and more particularly in order that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may be in a better position to ensure the development of the country on the lines indicated above, it is necessary that the old position in which HisMajesty had not full jurisdiction in these territories, with the exception ofLabuan, should be remedied and that it should be possible to legislate for the mall by Order-in-Council. Immediately on the reoccupation of these territories,direct authority will be exercised by the Military Commander, who will carry with him sufficient authority to enable him to exercise such direct powers andcontrol over the territories as will be necessary during the period of military administration. This military authority, even if it fell to be exercised by a british commander, would, however, not enable His Majesty to legislate for the threeStates, North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak, by Order-in-Council, and, in any case,the jurisdiction of the Military Commander would not persist when the military administration gave way to a permanent civil administration.
3. It is considered that the most effective way to achieve our purposeswill be : *(a) To acquire from the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company the sovereign and administrative rights which they possess and havehitherto exercised; and thereafter to provide for the future govern-ment of the territory on its liberation by an Administration under the direct authority of His Maiesty&apos;s Government.(b) To incorporate the present Settlement of Labuan in the new Administra-tion for North Borneo.(c) To conclude new treaties with the Sultan of Brunei and the Rajah of sarawak at the earliest opportunity which will accord to His Majestysuch jurisdiction in their States as will enable His Majesty to legislate for these territories under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to the efullest extent. In the case of Sarawak, the new treaty should also secure theacceptance by the Rajah of a resident British Adviser whose advicemust be sought and acted upon in all substantial matters of policyand administration. (The present treaty with Brunei already providesfor a resident British Adviser.)3. The territories in Borneo are still comparatively undeveloped and theyhave few racial or other affinities. At this stage, therefore, the basis for close reunion between them hardly exists. Community of policy and of administrative action can, however, be assured from the outset under the direction of theGovernor-General at Singapore, whose appointment is recommended and the promotion of closer union should be a continuing matter of our policy.orleiiutallystrylisofiemies,rrymdarytishireease,;ary
