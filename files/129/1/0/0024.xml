-   . - - feesTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.    .CP. (45) 124.20th August, 1945.CABINET.PROPOSED SUSPENSION OE THE CIVIL DEFENCE ACTS, 1937-39.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home&quot; Department.It is important that a Bill should be introduced soon suspending the operative provisions of the Civil Defence Acts, which are open to the criticism that they are inappropriate to existing circumstances. The Bill should, however,empower the Secretary of State to revive by Orders in Council any or all of thesuspended provisions, to apply generally or in particular areas only, when in hisopinion it was expedient to do so for the more adequate defence of the country.If the Bill were introduced soon, when there would be no grounds for appre-hending any speedy resumption of air attack, and there manifestly had not been time to assimilate the lessons of intensive raiding and to translate them into a revised civil defence practice, the measure ought not to provoke controversy.Delay in introducing the measure might, on the other hand, invite enquiries asto the Governments policy and intentions as regards active and passive air defence while we still were not in a position to answer these enquiries.2. It would, in my view, be important to make it clear, in discussions with representative associations of local authorities before the Bill was introduced,and to repeat when the Bill came forward for Second Reading, that the revival of suspended provisions would be based primarily on improvements in technique,availability of labour for shelter construction, &amp;c, and not upon the international situation.3. The general public naturally look to the Government to providepermanent defences in this country against enemy air attack. It is now generally accepted that an efficient civil defence organisation, including arrangements forpassive air defence of industry and public utilities, is an essential feature ofnational defence. Indeed, the Chiefs of Staff recently approved in principle and recommended to the late Government that the peace-time civil defence organisa-tion should be developed in parallel with the active air defence. Since VE-day,moreover, enquiries as to the Governments future intentions in this matter havebeen received from local authorities, organisations concerned with civil defence and from the Federation of British Industries.4. So long ago as the 2nd January last (W.M. (45) 1st Conclusions,Minute 10) the War Cabinet gave a general approval in principle to the thenHome Secretary&apos;s (now Lord Presidents) proposals for the establishment ofnucleus peace-time civil defence services (W.P. (44) 660). The launching of thescheme was deferred pending further consultations between the Home secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the caretaker Government regarding theamount of financial assistance to be given to local authorities for organising and maintaining these services. The matter is still under consideration, but a new development of the greatest significance has occurred. Atomic bombs have been used. The kind and area of devastation which they create make it necessary tore-examine the feasibility of coping with heavy raids through the medium of localauthority services the dominating conception of the present Civil Defence Acts.Entirely new lines of approach to the problems of both active and passive defencemay be called for.5.- My colleagues will, of course, understand that the organisation of services of wardens, rescue parties, report centres, &amp;c, however important asa feature of passive defence, is merely one of the duties imposed upon localauthorities by the Civil Defence Acts 1937-39. In point of time these services can probably be provided much more quickly than adequate structural prepara-tions against future air attacks.   It has to be remembered, however, that the[30382]Copy No. t) I)
present statutory basis for all such preparations was formulated while air attacks on this country in a not remote future seemed probable. The language of theCivil Defence Acts bears every evidence of the emergency that has now happilypassed. In the event of a renewed threat of attack, it might be necessary to fall back on the general framework-of the Acts, of which, indeed, some sectionsare still needed for current administration. As a whole, however, the Acts are particularly inappropriate to present circumstances. It would be wrong toattempt to enforce statutory obligations in the matter of civil defence upon local authorities or industry in the present state of our knowledge of what formfuture air attacks might take and the whole subject ought in my view to bere considered. For example, the Acts and Regulations now in force require localauthorities in the discharge of their duties to prepare air raid schemes of a comprehensive character, entailing more than the provision of the personnelservices mentioned in the previous paragraph. If it were not for D.R. 23CAA(which presumably will soon have to be repealed now that hostilities with Japanhave ceased) those local authorities which are under an obligation to provideair raid shelter would still be able to serve effective notices under Section 16of the Civil Defence Act, 1939, requiring the provision of shelter for personsworking or living in factory premises or commercial buildings, or working inor about mines -this notwithstanding the fact that some such shelters are nowquite properly in the course of demolition. Under Section 23 of the Civil DefenceAct it is still open to factory inspectors or local authorities to require industrial undertakings to train their employees in the routine to be followed in the eventof an air raid and also to train a suitable proportion of these employees in first-aid treatment, fire-fighting and anti-gas measures. Moreover, obligationsstill exist under the Acts with regard to such matters as camouflage and theobscuration of lights : to what extent static camouflage and the black-out will afford protection in future air attacks is obviously a question on which animmediate decision is not practicable.6. From the foregoing it is clear that before the Home Office can give usefuladvice to the parties on whom Civil Defence obligations still rest, as to the manner of discharging them, much research must be undertaken into the most modernmethods of attack and defence. The increase in the number of aircraft capableof attaining supersonic speed is reducing very largely the efficacy of warning-systems as at present known in this country, as a means of enabling the civilian population to take shelter before attack or of calling out the Services to action.As regards shelter provision, which is perhaps the greatest single difficulty tobe faced, new sites must be chosen in relation to the possibility of a reduced oreven no warning period and improved designs must be evolved in the light ofnew missiles and tactics. In short, a new technique of passive defence must beevolved and civil defence plans, based on research still in progress, must be co-ordinated with plans for the active defence of the country.&apos; The question of recruiting man-power for permanent civil defence services must also be considered in relation to man-power requirements of the other Defence Services. Apartfrom such technical aspects, it was decided more than a year ago, in connectionwith the preparation of the Housing Manual, that on. grounds of cost and inorder not to delay the constructional programme no special provision could becontemplated for incorporating domestic shelter in the post-war houses, then the subject of &quot;consideration. It would, no doubt, generally be thought inexpedientthat at the present time, even if all questions of design and siting had been resolved, building labour and material should be diverted from housing andother urgent building work to provide shelter for use in the next war.7. I am therefore driven to the conclusion that, without in any way mini-economising the importance of establishing as soon as may be comprehensive and adequate civil defence arrangements for this country, local authorities andindustry must be temporarily relieved of obligations which, if carried out inaccordance with the letter of the law and with out-of-date technique, would contri-bute little to the safety and morale of the civilian population in the event of another war.8. If my colleagues approve in principle of the action advocated in para-graphs 1 and 2 of this Paper, I will have a Bill prepared and submit it to theLegislation Committee.9.   The Secretary of State for Scotland concurs in these proposals.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,20th August, 1945.
