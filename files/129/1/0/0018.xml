Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.secret..        \ &apos;: :ir:f-if[j - ^--- Copy No.CP. (45) 118.lUh August, 1945.CABINET.MINISTERIAL  RESPONSIBILITIES   FOR  HOUSING.Note by the Prime Minister.THE question of a long-term reallocation of functions between ministers will need careful consideration. It would involve legislation. It would be premature to come to a decision now. We cannot afford to delay in pushing on with the housing programme. I have, therefore, decided that the following arrangements will best suit the present situation.2. The responsibility for housing must rest with the Minister of health in England and Wales and with the Secretary of State in Scotland.The Minister of Town and Country Planning will have plenty to do with theparticular duties of his office and especially with preparing legislation on com-pensation and betterment.   He is not really directly concerned with housing.The Minister of Works has a general responsibility for the organisation and efficiency of the building industry as a whole. He should not, however, share inthe responsibility for housing policy. The relation of the Ministry of Works tothe Health Departments will be that of a Supply Department concerned with theprovision of jorefabricated houses and the supply of building materials and components. The Minister of Works will undertake all dealings with the Boardof Trade and Ministry of Supply in regard to building materials and components.While the Ministry of Works will continue to advise on questions of buildingtechnique, final responsibility for the design of houses will be re-transferred tothe Ministry of Health.The complaint that to give housing to the Minister of Health will overburdenhim does not seem to be well-founded. During the war the Home Secretary,despite his wide range of duties, was also Minister of Home Security. He was for this purpose given an additional Under-Secretary. I think it desirable toappoint an additional Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Health so that oneof the two may devote his whole time to housing. It has already been arranged that one of the Under-Secretaries of State in Scotland, Mr. Buchanan, shall be especially charged with housing.
3. I do not think it desirable to set up a committee under one of the senior ministers. The Minister of Health must be responsible. I accordingly proposeto set up a committee over which &quot;he will&apos;preside.&apos;&apos;&apos; &quot;&quot;Apart from Town&quot; and &quot;country planning and Works, the other Ministries are only indirectly concerned, except possibly Labour; and I consider that, following the precedent of the Civil DefenceCommittee, this Committee might consist largely of Under-Secretaries whowould be charged by their respective Ministers to look after such matters relatingto housing as concern their Departments. In the early stages, when labour isone of the main difficulties, it will be convenient if the Minister of Labour canhimself attend the meetings of the Committee. Later on, he could be represented by his Under-Secretary.The Committee will therefore ba composed as follows :  The Minister of Health (Chairman).The Minister of Works.The Minister of Town and Country Planning, or his parliamentary secretary.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland,Mr. Buchanan.The Minister of Labour and National Service, or his parliamentary secretary.A Parliamentary Secretary from the Board of Trade, preferablyProfessor Marquand.A Parliamentary Secretary from the Ministry of Supply.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, andThe  Parliamentary  Secretary  responsible  for  Housing  in  theMinistry of Health.4. It will be understood that on particular occasions the Ministers may beasked or may desire to attend in place of their Under-Secretaries. The existenceof this committee will not prevent informal consultations with the Ministers incharge of Departments. It will be the duty of the Minister of Health and the under-Secretary of State for Scotland to formulate their programme for theerection of houses, whether permanent or temporary, and for repairs, &amp;c. Theymust also see that the supply of labour, material, fixtures, furnishing and trans-portation is properly phased so that all these necessaries may move forwardtogether.5. Detailed directives will be issued without delay to give effect to the broad principles outlined in this note.6. A monthly Progress Report will be rendered to the Cabinet showing theprogramme and the progress made. The Minister will report directly to me inthe event of any difficulties arising with other Ministries which cannot be clearedeither by the committee or by personal contact. The utmost drive and vigourmust be put into the campaign for houses.C. R.A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1.l%th August, 1945.
