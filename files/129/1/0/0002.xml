NAVAL SITUATION. European Waters.1.   The port of Danzig was reopened in part on the 5th.The German meteorological station on Spitzbergen is to be handed over in working order and its staff removed.Reports from Holland state that the Maas will be reopened to shippingwithin the next few days. The work included the repair and reconstruction oflocks and weirs, the removal of destroyed bridges, and the clearance of the250 ships sunk at Maasbracht. Dutch workmen were helped with materialprovided by the British. There is at present no electricity to operate the locks,and this has to be done by hand. The difficulties of the work were increased bythe necessity of preserving as much as possible of the steel and concrete construc-tion, and it will be a year before all bridges and locks can be completely repaired.East Indies.2. During a recent patrol H.M. S/M Thrasher sank by gunfire five coastersand a junk off the Kedah River (Malacca Strait).Pacific.Japan.3. It was announced on the 9th that the Allied Fleets had returned to the attack on Japan, and that carrier-borne aircraft had attacked enemy shipping,airfields and other military targets in Northern Honshu. No details are yet available.The Japanese hospital ship Tatibana Maru was intercepted by U.S.destroyers on the 3rd off Honshu and machine guns and ammunition were found on board, besides 1,500 &quot;patients,&quot; the majority of whom were very fit andunwounded.   The ship was seized and escorted to port.Recent information states that during the carrier-borne aircraft attack on targets in the Tokyo area on the 30th, 114 Japanese aircraft were destroyed onthe ground. Damaged warships included the light cruiser Kashima, an auxiliarycarrier of the Kobe class, a S/M tender and the s.s. Conte Verde (ex-Italian,18,765 tons); besides 10 destroyers or destroyer escorts, four U-boats, 18 cargo ships and 25 small craft.Other Waters.4. U.S. submarines on the. 1st shelled Urakawa (S. Hokkaido) and sank26 small craft in the South China Sea. They also report the sinking of a patrol craft or minelayer and five other vessels south of the Kuriles, five cargo ships inthe Inland Sea, a naval auxiliary and 56 small craft in the Gulf of Siam, and asmall craft off Singapore.U.S. carrier-borne aircraft on the 4th sank a tug and six small ships offBalikpapan and damaged others. On the following day three small ships were sunk and a submarine chaser damaged off Haichow (Shantung).On the 6th they raided Wake Island, and throughout the week-end attackedshipping off the Chinese coast.It is announced that the Far East Air Force, including the R.A.A.F., have destroyed or severely damaged 2,846,932 tons of Japanese shipping and 1,375aircraft during the first seven months of 1945.Japanese U-boats.5. At the beginning of the war the Japanese had 58 U-boats in commission.The projected construction for 1941-44 was 112 boats, of which half were of thelargest type. The peak was reached in January 1944, when 90 boats were estimated to be in operation.During 1942/1943 losses were relatively light and were offset by new construction. During 1944, however, the year when the Allied offensive opera-tions opened, some 50 U-boats were sunk, out of about 100 lost since the beginningof hostilities. One by one, bases in the Marshalls, Solomons, Bismarcks, Carolinesand marinas were abandoned, and all operations were directed and controlledfrom the four home bases, Yokosuka, Kure, Sasebo and Maizuru.Losses of U-boats have continued to be heavy during 1945, and the presentoperational strength of the force, including four ex-German boats taken over inPacific waters, probably does not exceed 60.
Minesweeping.6.   During the week 249 British mines have been destroyed in Home Waters.Off the Swedish coast 74 anti-submarine mines, have been destroyed bySwedish minesweepers.In the Mediterranean 308 mines have been destroyed, including 17 off malta and 236 by Italian sweepers in the Gulf of Naples, off Southern Italy and offGallipoli.The mine totals are 19,740 German and 5,052 British.Shipping Casualties.7.
