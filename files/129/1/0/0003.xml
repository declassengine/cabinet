Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1945.SECRET.Copy No.   cp. (45) 103.10th August, 1945.CABINET.HOUSE OF COMMONS PROCEDURE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.IN my Memorandum of the 4th August, 1945, on the King&apos;s Speech(CP. (45) 94) I suggested that we should take the earliest possible steps to rationalise and modernise Parliamentary procedure, always providing theessential supremacy of Parliament is preserved. In this connection I referred tothe proposals for alterations in Parliamentary procedure in order to facilitate theprogress of legislation during the reconstruction period, which were drawn up under the Coalition Government by&apos; a Sub-Committee of the Machinery ofGovernment Committee and were circulated to the War Cabinet on the18th August, 1944,* by the Chairman of the Committee (Sir John Anderson) inthe form of a draft Memorandum.2. I annex a copy of this Memorandum. I believe that this was agreed tounanimously by the Machinery of Government Committee. The War Cabinet onthe 13th December, 1944, invited the Joint Parliamentary Secretaries to theTreasury to take soundings among Members of the House in order to ascertaintheir views with regard to the appointment of a Select Committee on Parlia-mentary Procedure (W.M. (44) 168th Conclusions, Minute 4). This was done,and the War Cabinet were informed on the 22nd January, 1944,(W.M. (45) 7th Conclusions, Minute 10) that 75 to 85 per cent, of ConservativeMembers appeared to be against the appointment of a Select Committee for thispurpose at this juncture. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Mr. ErnestBrown) had intimated that the Liberal National Members were of the same view,which was also shared by the Chief Liberal Whip. On the other hand, labour members were generally in favour of taking any steps which might lead to thespeeding up of the Parliamentary machine, and for this reason would supportthe proposal for a Select Committee. It was clear, however, that the view ofthe majority of the House was that the matter should be left for considerationuntil after a general election.3. I regard this matter as one of great importance and urgency, because,unless Parliamentary procedure can be substantially speeded up, I see little prospect of carrying through the heavy programme of legislation which we have in view for the forthcoming and succeeding Parliamentary Sessions. It isparticularly urgent in relation to the number and procedure of Standing Com-mittees on Bills.4. The Machineiy of Government Committee proposals seem to me to beremarkably satisfactory, having regard to the political circumstances obtainingwhen they were prepared. It would clearly be advantageous if the Cabinet wereto approve them, if possible without alteration, as a basis for action in thepresent Parliament. We could then, I hope, refer, if this is permissible, to thefact that, though the then War Cabinet w^ere not committed to the proposals, theyhad been worked out by a Committee of Ministers under the Coalition Govern-ment.   This would put us in a strong position in the House.* W.P. (44) 424.[30329]b
5.   As to the handling of the matter in Parliament I would suggest that (1) A Motion should be put down in the very near future for the appointmentof a Select committee on Parliamentary Procedure with powers forthe Committee to sit while the House is in recess.(2) The Memorandum prepared by the Machinery of Government Committeeshould be forwarded to the Select Committee as an expression of theprovisional views of the Government, and the Select Committee shouldbe asked to submit an interim report on the matters dealt with in theMemorandum with the least possible delay. It should be made clearthat this is, of course, without prejudice to the right of the Committeeto deal with other matters of procedure. In this connection it may beof interest to mention that when the Campbell-Bannerman Govern-ment was returned in 1906 a Select Committee on parliamentary procedure was set up at once and reported within less than three weeks after the members were nominated, though admittedly the report was confined to the question of &quot; double or single sittings, hours of meet-ing and rising and certain matters immediately connected therewith.&quot;6. I should hope that by these means it would be possible to get a satisfactoryreport with reasonable expedition and I ask the concurrence of my colleagues inthe above proposals.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,10th August, 1945.
, annex.sPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.Draft Memorandum.The need for a modification of Parliamentary procedure.1. During the period of the transition from war to peace a really heavyprogramme of legislation of one kind and another will be required, and will berequired urgently, for the purposes of reconstruction. This will be the casewhatever the political complexion of the Government in power at the relevanttime; the contents of the programme would no doubt vary according to that factor,but on any view the volume will be such that any attempt to put it through under normal conditions of Parliamentary procedure in the course of one or two sessionswould be likely to result in a breakdown which might be disastrous to the interestsof the country. His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly thought it right tosubmit, for the earnest and urgent consideration of Parliament, certain suggestions for the modification of Parliamentary procedure as proposals which might begiven a trial, on an experimental basis, during the first one or two sessions afterthe end of hostilities in Europe.Reasons for emphasis on House of Commons procedure.2. The problem is most acute in relation to the House of Commons. More-over, any saving of time effected in passing legislation through that House is likelyto improve the situation in the House of Lords in so far as it enables Billsintroduced in the lower House to be sent up earlier in the session. TheGovernment have accordingly directed their main attention to the procedure inthe House of Commons.Matters not dealt with: subordinate legislation and private and provisional orderBills.3. This memorandum does not deal with the question of subordinate legisla-tion. The proposals of the Government on that subject have already been made known to the House in connection with the establishment of the Committee onStatutory Rules and Orders, &amp;c, which was set up on the 21st June last. nor does it deal with questions of private or provisional order Bills. These questions are under consideration by the Government in a different context (as indicated bythe answer given by the Prime Minister to a question by Sir Arnold Gridley onthe 20th June last), but private and provisional order Bills do not make substantialdemands on the time of Parliament. Again, the memorandum does not deal(except incidentally) with the dates of sessions or hours of sitting of the House ofCommons. These are matters which necessarily have to be determined in thelight of the circumstances prevailing from time to time, but it is evident that itwill be necessary to ask Parliament to sit on as many days and for as many hoursas is reasonably practicable during the relevant period.Outline of proposals for the Committee stage: reference of substantially all bills to Standing Committees and acceleration of passage of Bills in standing committees.4. The main expenditure of time upon legislation arises at the committee stage. A major Bill may occupy ten or even twenty days in Committee if taken on the floor of the House, or three or four months if taken upstairs. The recent example of the Education Bill, which occupied fourteen days on the floor of theHouse in Committee alone, provides an indication of the difficulties which wouldconfront any Government seeking to pass three or four Bills of that order in thecourse of a session to say nothing of smaller Bills, of which substantial numbers are required in a normal session, and exceptional numbers are likely to be needed in the abnormal conditions following the end of the war in Europe. If the attemptwere made at a time when the opposition was organised upon strict party lines,the difficulties would be further magnified. The first main proposals of theGovernment are accordingly directed to the Committee stage. In their opinion,it will be necessary during the reconstruction period both to send practically allBills upstairs and to find means of accelerating their passage in Standing-Committee. These proposals are set out more fully in paragraphs 5 to 11 below.[30329] B 2
Reference of Bills to Standing Committees.5. In order to secure the committal of Bills to Standing Committees, nochange in the Orders of the House is required beyond a return to Standing order no. 46, under which all Bills (except Bills for imposing taxes, consolidated fundor appropriation Bills, and provisional order confirmation Bills) stand committed to a Standing Committee unless the House otherwise orders. Standing order no. 46 has been in force since 1907, but it has been the practice to retain &quot; thegreat measures of the Session &quot; on the floor of the House, as well as short bills which are unlikely to require a detailed Committee Stage, and Bills introduced in circumstances of such urgency that it is necessary to ask the House&apos; to passthem within a few days, or even in one day (for example, the Merchant Shipping(Carriage of Munitions to Spain) Bill of 1936). The practice of retaining Billson the ground of importance has naturally varied from time to time accordingto the exigencies of the situation, and a Bill which would be regarded as one ofthe great measures of one Session would not necessarily be so regarded in thenext. In the reconstruction period, the Government propose that the practiceshould be abandoned in virtually all cases other than (a) Bills already excepted under Standing Order No. 46;(b) Any Bill which it may be necessary to pass with great expedition; and(c) &quot; One-Clause &quot; Bills not requiring detailed examination in Committee.An exception would have to be made if any Bill of first-class constitutionalimportance were introduced, of the order, for instance, of the Bill for the Parlia-ment Act, 1911, or the Statute of Westminster, 1931; and the Government wouldnot divest themselves of the right to move that any important Bill should beretained on the floor of the House if in the circumstances of the individual case they thought that course preferable. Equally the right of any Member to movethat any Bill should be retained on the floor of the House would, of course, remainunimpaired. But, with the exceptions indicated, the Government would for their part make a practice of refraining from moving in that sense, and of opposingsuch a motion if moved from another quarter.Outline of proposals for acceleration of Bills in Standing Committees:extension of sitting hours, time table, increase of number of committees,and minor amendments of practice and procedure.6. The reference of substantially all Government Bills to standing committees may be estimated to save anything up to thirty days on the floor ofthe House of Commons in the course of a session subject to any allowance whichmay have to be made for additional time on Report of the Bills.*      &apos; -This saving would, however, be of little value if it were achieved only atthe cost of a bottleneck upstairs. Accordingly, the Government propose that inorder to accelerate the. passage of the Bills in Standing Committee (a) The number of hours devoted to the sittings of Standing committees should be substantially increased over the pre-war minimum standardof four hours per week;(6) Machinery should be prepared for prescribing and enforcing a time limit on the proceedings in Standing Committee;(c) The number of Standing Committees should be increased, the size of theCommittees being reduced, if necessary, for the purpose; and(d) Certain minor amendments should be made in the procedure and practice in the debates in Committee.Hours of sittings of Standing Committees.7. Before the war it was the normal practice of Standing Committees to sitonly for four hours per week, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Tuesdays andThursdays. Afternoon sessions were only occasionally held, usually towards theend of the proceedings on a Billwhen time was becoming short. The government propose that these hours should be substantially increased. The possible methodsof doing so are to add an. additional sitting day or to provide for longer sittinghours on sitting days, and it is suggested that, both these methods should beadopted..   For example, the Committees might sit on Wednesdays as well as* This estimate is based upon figures for the Sessions 1934-35 and 1936-37, in which outof 80^ and 611 days respectively devoted to legislation on the floor of the House (excluding theFinance Bill.and: Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills), 38$ and 18$ days respectivelywere :occupied. by Committee stages. 1   ....
510Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the normal hours for morning sittings might be10-45 a.m. until 1-15 p.m. These proposals alone, if accepted, would nearly double the normal sitting time of Standing Committees. In addition, the Govern-ment suggest that, if a situation arises where there is a danger of a blockageupstairs while time is relatively easy on the floor of the House, the House should adjourn immediately after Questions on a certain number of days in order toenable the Standing Committees to continue in the afternoon. (If substantiallyall Bills are sent upstairs as proposed above, it is much more probable than ithas been hitherto that there will&apos; be times when the House itself is comparativelyfree from work.) For this purpose, therefore, the Government propose that thereshould be a return to the old Standing Order No. 49A, which was passed in 1919but was never used and was repealed as obsolete in 1933* The proposals outlinedhere as to the hours of sittings of Standing Committees are, of course, based onthe assumption that in the relevant period the House will have reverted to its pre-war hours of sitting at least to the extent that it will no longer meet duringthe morning. If this is not so the only alternative appears to be to make a muchmore extensive use of the practice of adjourning the House in order to enable theCommittees to sit.Time table on proceedings in Standing Committee:  alternative methods.8. The Government also consider that steps should be taken to secure thatBills committed to Standing Committees are reported to the House at theappropriate time. Without resorting to a guillotine resolution proper, somethingmight be achieved for this purpose if the House were to pass a resolution requiring the Committee to which the Bill is referred to report the Bill by a given date, with or without an instruction enabling them to allocate the available time as betweenthe various clauses or groups of clauses of the Bill. Such a resolution would,however, lack effective sanction, and if the proceedings in Committee were not completed by the time specified in tha Resolution, the Committee Stage would haveto be finished off on the floor of the House. The Government therefore proposethat in any case where it is essential to obtain the report of a Bill within a given time, the proceedings in Committee should be governed by a special type ofguillotine resolution.Guillotine resolutions in relation to proceedings in Standing Committee.9. This resolution would be passed by the House. It would settle the totaltime to be made available for the Committee Stage of the Bill, and would alsocontain provisions, on the lines of a normal guillotine resolution, providing forthe conclusion of the proceedings on the whole of the Bill, and on particularclauses or groups of clauses of the Bill, by means of putting without debate all questions necessary to dispose of the business. The resolution would not, however,itself specify the intermediate times at which proceedings on particular clausesor groups of clauses were to be brought to a conclusion, but would leave thatto be determined by a Special Committee of the House in accordance with theproposal set out below (see paragraph 12).) The main problem arising inconnection with the application of a guillotine resolution to proceedings inStanding Committee is the unit to be taken for the purpose of measuring time.The system of &apos;&apos; allotted days &apos;&apos; which is used in the case of a resolution relatingto proceedings on the floor of the House is, as such, inappropriate to proceedings in Standing Committees, and it is for consideration whether it would be best to arrange the time on the basis of sittings, of sitting days, or of weeks, or by reference to actual dates. The question depends to some extent upon how muchuse is made of the practice of adjourning the House as proposed above, and uponthe hours and days of the week adopted for the sittings of the Committees. Theproblem is not, however, an insoluble one; the greatest accuracy would be attained by taking a sitting as the unit (treating afternoon sittings as separate sittingsfor the purpose), but in practice it might prove more convenient to adopt oneof the other alternatives&apos; indicated above. It goes without saying that theapplication of a time limit to proceedings in Standing Committee should not beregarded as absolving the Chairman from the duty to use his powers of selection and closure so as to direct the debate to the main points at issue; on the contrary,the time limit would make it all the more necessary that these powers should beso used. .......   :,.   . .. . ..* The Standing Order provided that a motion might be made, by a Minister at the eorn-mencement of public business to adjourn the House in order to facilitate the business of standing committees, and that such a ihotion should be decided without amendment or debate.
Number of Standing Committees.10. Under Standing Order No. 47 the maximum number of standing committees, including the Standing Committee on Scottish Bills, is five. Thefour Standing Committees other than the Scottish Committee are composed of between thirty and fifty permanent members, and between ten and thirty-five members added by the Committee of Selection for the particular Bill underconsideration, and the quorum is twenty. Accordingly the maximum numberof members who could be put on a Standing Committee for any Bill was eighty-five, though in practice the usual numbers appointed before the war were sixtyor seventy according to the importance of the Bill. The Government proposethat there should be an increase in the number of Standing Committees, and consider that no difficulties of accommodation should be allowed to stand in theway of this increase. In their view an increase will be necessary to secure thepassage of the volume of legislation which is likely to be required during thereconstruction period, and is also desirable in order to provide further oppor-tunities for members of the House to perform useful service as such. For thelatter reason, it is not in their opinion a necessary corollary of an increase in thenumber of Committees that there should be a reduction in the size of thoseCommittees. If, however, difficulties were encountered in securing the necessarynumbers, they would propose that any reduction in size should be effected in the nucleus of the Committees, leaving the numbers who may be added for aparticular Bill as it stands under existing orders.Minor amendments of practice and procedure: restriction of debate on the clause and increased use of explanatory material.11. Two other suggestions may be made as to the proceedings on theCommittee Stage : (1) The debates on the question, which has to be put on each clause, &quot; thatthe clause stand part of the Bill,&quot; might be restricted by means of anew Standing Order to the effect that where a clause has been amendeddebate should not be permitted on the clause unless the Chairman isof opinion that the principle of the clause, or any substantial pointarising thereon, has not been adequately discussed. The object ofthis would be to assist the Chairman in preventing abuse of the debateby means of the delivery of second reading speeches or the repetition of arguments already advanced in the debates on amendments. Anysuch Standing Order should be so framed as to leave it open to members to ask questions as to the effect of the clause, so long as they did not make a speech in doing so.(2) A fuller use might well be made of a practice occasionally adopted inthe past, by which the Minister in charge of a Bill circulates to thecommittee notes on any clauses which are not readily understoodwithout explanation. This expedient would reduce the number ofcases in which amendments are put down for the purpose of obtainingan explanation of the clause, and would prevent the waste of time which occasionally occurs when amendments are based on amisapprehension of the effect of the clause.Improvement of time-table procedure: establishment of &quot;Emergency business committee.&quot;12. The second main proposal which the Government wish to put forwardis for an improvement in the procedure relating to time-tables. For this purpose they suggest that a Special Committee of the House should be appointed at thebeginning of the Session, consisting of the members of the Chairmen&apos;s Paneltogether with perhaps five additional members nominated by Mr. Speaker. Ina case where a Bill was subject to a guillotine resolution, the function of theCommittee would be to allocate, as between the various-parts of the Bill, the timeallowed by the resolution for any particular stage of the Bill. In the view ofthe Government, it might be more satisfactory to the House in general if the detailed allocation of the time were worked out by a Committee of this characterinstead of being laid down, as hitherto, by the terms of the resolution itself. Theydo not, however, consider that it would be practicable to leave it to such aCommittee to settle the total amount of time to be made available for a Bill. Sofar as the Committee stage is concerned, the function of the Special Committeeof the House would, if the previous proposals are accepted, be limited almost exclusively to proceedings in Standing Committee (see paragraph 9 above); but
it would also be required to act in relation to proceedings on the floor of the house in any case where a guillotine was applied to the other stages of the Bill. If anysuch Committee is appointed it is suggested that it might be known as .&apos;&apos; theEmergency Business Committee,&quot; or by some other title indicating the exceptionalI nature of the business with which it is to be concerned. Such a Committee might also be of considerable assistance in the arrangement of a voluntary -time-table in appropriate cases.Minor changes in financial procedure on Bills.13. Apart from the proposals outlined above, the Government have a fewfurther suggestions to make for the reform of the procedure a.t the various stages of Bills. These are of comparatively small importance and are all related to financial matters  (1) It is suggested that the time has come to give effect to a recommendationput forward some time ago, that on the report stage of a financial resolution the question should be put without amendment or debate.This should apply not only to the normal financial resolution movedafter second reading of the Bill, but also to Ways and Means resolu-tions other than those upon which the Finance Bill is founded, andthe object would be to prevent the repetition or anticipation on thereport of the resolution of the second reading debate on the Bill. Inpractice debate seldom arises now on the report of a financial resolution, but the opportunity remains and could be used forpurposes of obstruction. (With this change there would still be someduplication of debate on the Committee stage of the resolution andthe second reading of the Bill, but it does not appear practicable to dispense with this.)(2) A change might now be made in the rule which prevents two stages ofa Financial Resolution from being taken on the same da,y. Under thepresent practice no two stages of any financial business may be taken on the same day (except in the case mentioned in Standing order no 70) without a special Procedure Resolution, and accordingly thereport of a Financial Resolution cannot be taken immediately aftercommittee, even where it is not desired to debate it. There appearsto be little point in the rule so far as it applies to Financial Resolu-tions, particularly if effect is given to the proposal in this paragraphas to the report stage of such Resolutions.(3) The technical rule under which a Financial Resolution is required tocover&apos; provisions of a Bill requiring money to be paid &apos;&apos; into theExchequer &quot; might now be abolished. The rule does not apply wherethe payments are directed to be made to a particular Minister,though the effect of such a provision is exactly the same.(4) Under the present practice of the House, any new clause or amendmentis out of order on report if it creates or imposes a charge on thepublic revenue or imposes or extends any tax, rate or other localburden, or varies the incidence of any such charge or burden. It issuggested that in order to save expenditure, of time on the recommittalof Bills this rule might now be abolished so far as it relates to rates or other local burdens.Methods of curtailing time spent on other business.14. The proposals outlined in the previous paragraphs are directed to the saving of time occupied by the passage of Bills. The Government have also considered how far it may be practicable to obtain more time for general legislation required for reconstruction purposes by curtailing the time taken upby other business. On this subject their provisional conclusions are mainlynegative. As regards private members&apos; time, they consider that the situation islikely to remain as at present during the relevant period. They do not, however,contemplate any inroad upon Question time. The proceedings on the budget and the Finance Bill offer certain opportunities for the repetition of debates,and have been subject to criticism on that account. On balance, however, theGovernment are of opinion that it would not be right to propose any change inthese proceedings, since the Finance Bill is pre-eminently a case in which theopportunity for second thoughts justifies expenditure of the additional time.The Government have also considered possible economies of time in relationto the business of supply, including Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills,
but are not &quot;able to make any general recommendation on that subject. Inparticular they do not advocate a repetition of the experiments of sending theestimates upstairs, or of a formal reduction in the number of days allotted tosupply and to moving Mr. Speaker out of the Chair on supply. These occasions,together with the proceedings on the Consolidated Fund Bills, provide oppor-tunities for general debates, and if those opportunities were curtailed it wouldbe a practical necessity to find equivalent time elsewhere. For the same reasonsthey nave decided not to recommend the allocation of a fixed number of days tothe spring supplementary estimates. On the other hand, the House has on occasion been willing to accept an agreed reduction in the number of supplydays where special circumstances have rendered this necessary, and has also on occasion passed the spring supplementaries under an agreed time-table. In thereconstruction period it may well be that the House would allow the government similar latitude if it appeared likely that a heavy programme of reconstructionBills would otherwise become blocked for lack of time. Apart from this, some additional time would.be made available if routine financial Bills (such as PublicWorks Loans Bills and Post Office Telegraph (Money) Bills) were sent upstairsin accordance with the previous recommendation.Carry over of public Bills.15. The Government have also examined again the much discussed questionof carrying over public Bills at the end of a session. In general they are opposedto the creation of any breach in the present rule, which lies at the root both of effective government and of effective opposition. If in tJhe relevant period a situation arises where one or more important Bills are likely to be lost through lack of time at the end of the session, the first line of defence should be, in their view, to prolong the session so far as this is practicable. If this were not sufficient, the question of carry over could still be considered on its merits in thelight of all relevant circumstances, and the Government do not rule out thepossibility that in some cases the immediate practical necessities might outweigh the general objections on the other side.
