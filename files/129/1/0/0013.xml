Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 113.lbth August, 1945.cabinet.MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. The Man-Power Committee have held a preliminary review of theman-power situation, in the light of the Japanese surrender, and submit thefollowing recommendations for the approval of the Cabinet:  (a) The principles of the demobilisation scheme (which was announced as a plan for reallocating man-power &quot; during any interim period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat, of Japan&quot;) should be maintained, notwithstanding the surrender of Japan.(b) There should be introduced a scheme of Class B releases for women, inorder to secure the early release from the Forces, out of turn, of a limited numberof women whose special skills are urgently required to restore production incertain civilian industries. The numbers of women to be released under thisscheme will not be large, and will be included within the total numbers of women to be released from the Forces under (c) below. The Ministry of Labour and national Service should complete the preparations already begun for the early introduction of this scheme.(c) Though demobilisation will continue to be regulated by the principles ofthe existing scheme, the rate of demobilisation will be increased. Previous planshad provided for the release of 836,000 in Class A (men and women) by the endof 1945. Provisional estimates indicate that it will now be possible to increase this figure to about 1,000,000.(d) Exceptional measures should be taken to increase the labour force in thecoal-mining industry. The Service Ministers are prepared to arrange for theearly release in Class B of all ex-miners still in the Armed Forces. This willhave the result that releases in Class B will temporarily exceed 10 per cent, ofthe releases in Class A; but it need not make it impossible to maintain the average level of Class B releases at 10 per cent, for the whole period up to the end of theyear.(e) The intake of men into the Forces up to the end of 1945 should stand atthe figure of 160,000 already authorised. This intake will be divided asfollows : To secure this intake the maximum age for call-up should be retained for thepresent at 30; but the increased cuts in the munitions industries should enablethe Ministry of Labour and National Service to find the numbers requiredwithout withdrawing key men who are essential for the restarting of civilindustry.Royal Navy   ...ArmyRoyal Air Force47,00068,00045,000Total160,000[30362]
Voluntary recruitment of women to the auxiliary services should continue upto the following numbers :-(/) Releases of labour from the munitions industries will be considerable.The provisional estimate made by the Joint War Production Staff (CP. (45) 114)is that a total of 1,155,000 may be released in the next eight weeks, as comparedwith a release of 900,000 up to the end of 1945 under previous plans.2. It is clear that there will be a substantial increase in the amount ofman-power available for civil industries and services over the next few months.Detailed plans for the redistribution of man-power cannot, however, be drawnup until final estimates are available of the numbers to be released from theForces and munitions industries. These estimates are in turn dependent onthe fresh appreciation which the Chiefs of Staff are now making of the forces required to meet our military commitments throughout the world in the new situation created by the surrender of Japan. This appreciation will becompleted by the 1st September : a revised programme for releases from theForces will be ready by the 14th September : and firm estimates of the labourneeded for the revised munitions programmes will be available by the end ofSeptember. Immediately thereafter the Man-Power Committee will prepare a detailed budget for the period ending the 30th June, 1946.3. Meanwhile, we recommend that a general statement should be made during the course of the Debate on the Address on the lines of the draft annexed.W.R.N.S.A.T.S.W.A.A.F.3,00010,0002,500Total.15,500E.

AJTNSXDraft of Statement to bo made irf parliament it was stated in the Gracious Speech that theGovernment &quot;will continue the orderly release of men andwomen from the Armed Forces on the basis of the plansannounced in the autumn of last year&quot;.Though actual fighting is over,  the time for fulldemobilisation has not yet arrived.      For some time  to comethe strength of the Armed Forces will have to be maintained at a high level in order to meet our military commitmentsthroughout  the world.      Japan&apos;s surrender will not affect our commitment a in Europe;    and. in the Fast we shall stillneed substantial forces - to maize our contribution towardsthe occupation of Japan, to recover our Colonial possessions,and to help in restoring order in other territories freed from enemy occupation.The problem therefore remains  one of orderlyreduction from the peak strength of total war to the lower level of this next &quot;occupational&quot; phase.    It was to meet this problem that my Et.  Hon.  Friend the Foreign Secretarydevised,  when he was Minister of Labour and National Service,the demobilisation scheme which was announced last autumn and met with very general approval.      Although this was announced as a scheme for reallocating man-power &quot;during any interim period between tin. defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan&quot; the principles of the  scheme  still stand,though Japan as well as Germany has now been defeated.Demobilisation will continue to be regulated in accordancewith those principles - release in Class A by groups basedon age and length or service, coupled with limited releases in Class B of men whose special skills are needed for the urgent tasks of reconstruction at home.      The Government

propose only one addition to the scheme - a Class. E releasescheme    for women,  in order to secure the earlier release from the Forces of a limited number&apos; of women formerly engagedin key occupations where lack of labour is!seriously delaying the restoration of civil production.Though the system of demobilisation will be theflame,  the surrender of Japan will make it possible, whenplans have been recast,  the acpelerate the rate at which men and women are being released from the Forces.Demobilisation will be&apos; speeded up;    and, while there must continue to be some variation, in the rate of demobilisationas between&apos;the three Services, we shall see to it that duringthe next few months we return to civil life as many men andwomen as can be released from the Forces consistently withmeeting our military commitments and preserving theprinciples of fair dealing between man and man - and betweenwoman and woman - on which the demobilisation sbheme is based.The call--up of young men must also continue.      Ithas always been a part of the demobilisation plan thatcompulsory recruitment of young men should continue in orderto  bring relief to  the older men who have borne the heat andburden of the day;    and to enable more of them to return totheir homes the call-up will include numbers of young men atpresent deferred,  particularly in the munitions industries.To ensure the speediest possible rate of release,  theGovernment propose that  the age up to which men will becalled up shall be retained for the present at 30.There is a vast demand for labour for the urgenttasks cf reconstruction at home, and for the restoration ofcivil industries and services to meet the  needs both of themhome marhet and the export trades.      In the coming monthswe shall begin to meet that demand,  in part by increased

releases from the Armed Forces,  but still more by releases from the munitions industries.      It is from this source thatwe shall provide the early relief for the labour shortage in9civil industry.     We estimate that during the next eight weeks well over a million people will be released&apos; from munitions.      This rapid transfer of labour is bound to bringsome difficulties of readjustment.      While the overalldemand for labour will for some time  to come continue to exceed the supply, some local and temporary unemployment is unavoidable, particularly where factories cannot quicklybe reconverted from their war-time uses to peace-time production, and in areas where now industries must beintroduced.      I trust that Members in all parts of the house and all responsible people outside it will recognise thatthis vast turn-over of man-power cannot be achieved without some dislocation and delay and will refrain from raisingunreasonable hopes,  that cannot be fulfilled,  of a quickand easy return to normal conditions.

Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 114,15th August, 1945.CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE MUNITIONS INDUSTRIES.Report by the. President of the Board of Trade.IN accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet I have examined withthe Joint War Production Staff the &quot;situation in the munitions industriesresulting from the end of the Japanese war. Immediate steps have been takenby the Service and Supply Departments to examine their programmes and toprepare the ground for drastic and immediate cuts. Some time will be requiredto prepare accurate figures and to assess the final level at which programmes willbe stabilised to cover the needs of the next year or so. Our military commit-ments have first to be examined by the Chiefs of Staff in the light of the new situation, and thereafter revised calculations of munitions requirements willhave to be made. It is hoped that by the end of September it will be possibleto indicate with reasonable firmness the picture up to the end of June 1946.In the meantime, the following estimates have been made of the releases to beexpected over the eight weeks following the Japanese surrender.A dmiralty.2. Apart from transfers from naval to merchant shipbuilding, whichcannot yet be assessed, the Admiralty expect to release 55,000 men and women in the period.Ministry of Supply.3. The Ministry of Supply expect to reduce their man-power by 600,000in the eight weeks from the present total of 1,100,000 down to 500,000.Ministry of Aircraft Production.4. The Ministry of Aircraft Production expect to reduce their total by500,000 from the present total of 1,100,000 down to 600,000.&apos;5. Thus a total of about 1,155,000 men and women will be released from the munitions industries in the eight weeks following the Japanese surrender.Releases will be small in the first week, but thereafter they should be fairly evenlyspaced throughout the period. There will, of course, be further releases there-after, the total and rate of which cannot yet be stated with any accuracy.6. Certain problems which arise in connection with these releases have beenconsidered, and are being dealt with as shown below.Advice to contractors.7. It has been arranged that the following statement shall be issued throughthe B.B.C. and the Press at the first convenient opportunity after the officialsurrender of Japan is announced : *&apos;1 An immediate review of war contracts is being made by the Depart-ments concerned. Main contractors whose programmes will be cancelled or reduced will shortly receive instructions from the Departments for whichthey are now working, and they should pass these instructions on to theirsub-contractors in the normal way. Until these instructions are received,work on existing contracts should continue and managements are asked to refrain wherever possible from making special enquiries.&quot;-[39363]
