SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 134.29th August, 1M5.CABINET.ASSISTANCE TO THE FRENCH IN REBUILDING THEIR aircraft industry.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Secretaryof State for Air, President of the Board of Trade, and the Ministerof Supply and Aircraft Production:DURING the last few months the French have made a number of requeststo us for assistance in developing their aircraft industry, but for one reason or another the answers we have had to give them have not always been as favourableas we could have wished. We think that the time has now come to review theposition and to see whether it would not be possible to give the French a greater measure of assistance than we have been able to do hitherto, since it is clearly in our interest both on defence and on economic grounds to ensure that the french should rebuild their air force and aircraft industry in substantial dependenceupon us.   &apos;2. In February last, when the French first proposed that they should send a mission to this country and to the United States to study aeronautical productionand development, the late Prime Minister ruled that no disclosures of secrettechnical information should be made to any of the Allies but the Americanspending further consideration. The result of this ruling was that an agreement was reached between ourselves and the Americans that the mission should be shown nothing of a secret nature, although it would be understood that any requestit might make for specific secret information would be given joint considerationby the British and American authorities. No secret information was, in fact,imparted to the mission. The French were disgruntled by this treatment. More-over, Mr. Churchilhs minute not only had the effect of preventing our authorities from allowing the French air mission to inspect material on the secret list, butalso had the effect of abruptly cutting off the small flow of information whichhad already been going to another French scientific mission under Dr. Rapkine,which had been in England since September 1944.3. In a paper dated the 28th April the Deputy Chiefs of Staff raised again in general terms the whole question of the exchange of technical and scientificinformation with the French on defence matters, concluding with the recom-mendation that the Americans should be informed that our intention was to disclose information to the French &quot;up to and including that graded secret&quot;with a few exceptions and that they should be asked to agree that where equip-ment was of combined origin release of information should be made on the same basis. This paper was approved by the Chiefs of Staff but was not acceptedby the late Prime Minister.4. When the French air mission was here they made various requests toour air authorities not involving the communication to them of secret information.These largely related to permission to manufacture various types of aircraft,aircraft engines and equipment. But when the Minister of Aircraft Productionrecommended these requests to Mr. Churchill for his consent the latter, in a minutedated the 23rd June, again ruled that the present was not a suitable time to make further concessions to the French, although should our relations with thembecome more satisfactory there would no doubt be an opportunity to reopen theproposals in question.5. In the Annex to this paper we give a list of the facilities which we should like to make available at once to the French, the grant of some of which, though not of all, would involve the release of &quot;secret&quot; information. One of theseproposals, viz. : that the French should be allowed to manufacture Mosquito VPs,hasalready been before the Cabinet in a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (OP. (45) 101). There was some doubt whether from the Americanpoint of view this proposal wTas entirely free from Lend-Lease complications.[30418]Printed for the Cabinet.  Auqust 1945.
This point has now been satisfactorily cleared between the Departments concerned and the Prime Minister has been asked, in accordance with the decision of theCabinet on the 9th August (CM. (45) 19th Conclusions, Minute 3), to approve there opening of negotiations with the French and our telling the Americans thatwe are doing so.6. While the French would be glad to manufacture Mosquito VTs, we know that they are very interested in the later development, viz., the de HavillandHornet, and in view of the long delay which has occurred since the Mosquitoproject was first put forward in February last, we think that the French shouldbe permitted to negotiate with the de Havilland Company for the follow-onmanufacture of Hornets. Permission should, if necessary, be contingent uponthe settlement of any residual Lend-Lease issues.7. This matter is urgent since a mission is arriving from France on or about the 10th September to discuss the re-equipment of the French Air Force.We would therefore now like authority to do the following :-- i(1) Inform the Americans that we intend to disclose information of interestto the French aircraft industry &quot;up to and including that graded&apos; secret,&apos; &quot; with certain specified exceptions to be &quot;notified to them,and ask the Americans to agree that where equipment of interest tothe French aircraft industry is of combined origin release ofinformation should be on the same basis.(2) Grant those facilities to. the French which are listed in the Annex.8.   The Chiefs of Staff have seen this memorandum and concur.E. B.S.R. S. C.29th August, 1945. J. W.ANNEX.    &quot;PRODUCTION OF  BRITISH AIRCRAFT IN FRANCE.Sanction is sought to give the French: (i) Permission to negotiate for the licensed manufacture of the VickersSupermarine Spiteful together with its engine, the Rolls-RoyceGriffon.(ii) Sufficient technical information to start experimental manufacture ofjet engines in France, together with general installation data (but notmanufacturing details) of the latest Rolls-Royce jet engine (definedfor this purpose as the B. 41) with, at a subsequent stage, arrange-ments for its licensed manufacture.(iii) Full access to data on 100/130 aviation fuel, together with the delivery of some quantity of it.(iv) In connection with the licensed manufacture of the de HavillandMosquito, permission for the follow-on manufacture of thede Havilland Hornet.(v) The maximum possible assistance in the supply of industrial equip-ment and materials and with technical assistance, for the manufactureof the types decided upon by them.(vi) Permission to negotiate for the licensed manufacture of propellers,engine accessories and such instruments and radio and radar equip-ment as our technical advisers may consider desirable,(vii) The immediate use of various types of British aircraft. Frenchsquadrons are now being equipped with Spitfires, and it is thoughtthat this policy could advantageously be extended to cover such other types of aircraft as -could be made available and would be acceptable to the French.[Note. A favourable background exists in France for the extension of our industrial interests in the aircraft field by reason of the repair schemesinstituted in certain French factories at the end of last year which havebeen sponsored by the Ministry of Aircraft Production and are being-carried out under the guidance of leading British contractors. Underthese arrangements Spitfires, Mosquitoes, Cheetah and Merlin engines and Rotol propellers, together with certain radio and radar instruments,are being repaired. A substantial part of this equipment is being usedfor the rearmament of the French Air Force. 1
