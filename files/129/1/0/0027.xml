(45) 127.27th August, 1945.CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JULY 1945 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND MANDATED TERR.T-TORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE first regular meeting of the Commonwealth Air Transport council was held in London in the second week in July under the chairmanship of LordSwinton. The Council was established as a result of a meeting of BritishCommonwealth representatives at Montreal in 1944 before the opening of theInternational Civil Aviation Conference at Chicago. The London meeting was attended by representatives of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,India and Southern Rhodesia. The future organisation of British Common-wealth air routes were discussed and many technical details settled. Apermanent secretarial was also established in London to be provided for thetime being by the Department of Civil Aviation.2. A Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference opened in london on the 16th July under the chairmanship of Lord Reith. It was attended by representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, theCommonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Indiaand Southern Rhodesia. (A representative of Burma attended as observer.)The object of the Conference was to frame recommendations to the governments with regard to the future organisation of the telecommunications system of theBritish Commonwealth and Empire and telecommunications policy in relationto the United States. The Conference, which concluded its meetings on thethird subject, submitted a unanimous report which has been referred to theseveral Governments for consideration.CANADA.3. The Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, announced on the 6th Julythat the Canadian Government had recognised the Polish Provisional Govern-ment. In his statement, Mr. King said that the Canadian Government expected,in due course, to exchange diplomatic representatives with the ProvisionalGovernment.4. Full powers were granted to the Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King,and the Minister of Justice, Mr. L. S. St. Laurent, to sign on behalf of canada the United States Charter. The Prime Minister has stated that parliament will be asked to ratify the Charter when it meets shortly and has expressed theconfident opinion that the Charter will be ratified unanimously. Canada is included in the executive committee of fourteen for the Preparatory commission at its meeting in London in August.5. In domestic affairs, interest has become focussed on the opening ofParliament on the 23rd August (since postponed until September), which willbe called upon to deal mainly with problems of reconstruction. For the mostpart satisfaction is felt at the election results.   The House of Commons will be[30402] b
stimulated by the entry of some promising young men, and the Government willbe faced by a stronger Opposition than it was during the last session. Animmediate problem will be that raised by the defeat of three Cabinet Ministers.The Prime Minister himself, who was defeated by&quot; the Service vote in his constituency of Prince Albert in Saskatchewan, was offered a safe seat inOntario.   (He was, in fact, re-elected at the by-election on the 6th August.)6. The Progressive Conservatives have now a clear majority in theOntario legislature with 66 seats and the C.C.F. and Liberals have dropped to and 11 seats respectively. As Mr. Hepburn and Mr. Jolliffee were bothdefeated in the provincial election the leadership of both parties has changed.Mr. Farquhar Oliver has been chosen House leader by the Liberals, andMr. W. J. Grummett will become the C.C.F. House leader, although Mr. Jolliffeewill continue as leader of the Ontario C.C.F.7. During the recent hearings of a Royal Commission (which is enquiringinto the OOF. Ontario leader&apos;s charge that the Conservative Governmentmaintained a secret police) a witness referred to a contribution of $40,000 madeby the Soviet Embassy in Canada to the Labour-Progressive party through aToronto stock brokerage office. The Soviet Embassy immediately issued a denialbranding the allegation as a &quot; deliberate lie &quot; and stated that the Embassy washere to &quot; convey messages from the Soviet Government in Moscow to theCanadian Government and has no relation whatever with any political partyin Canada.&quot;8. Considerable interest has been shown in the release of Adrian Arcand,head of the pre-war National Unity (Fascist) party of Canada, who wasinterned in June 1940 under the Defence of Canada Act regulations. The national unity party was formed at Kingston in July 1938. It first used the swastikaas its symbol, but later changed to the flaming torch. Arcand, shortly afterthe Kingston, meeting, told the audience in Montreal that the National party would be in power in June 1940, following a &quot;march on Ottawa.&quot; The mostbitter protests over Arcand&apos;s release have come from the Labour-Progressiveparty of Quebec, who have demanded that Arcand should be tried.9. Mr. Howe, Minister for Reconstruction, has announced that an airdevelopment branch of the Department of Reconstruction will undertake duringthe summer months an economic survey across Canada of all the airports and air services, so that the Government will be able to gauge traffic possibilities indifferent sections of the country. The results of the survey will act as a guideto the Air Transport Board in granting licences for operating services. Theplan will include a complete and thorough survey of existing rail, bus, and air services at all important points across Canada.10. The housing problem in every large city in Canada is acute, and is increasing as more men are demobilised from the armed forces. Representativesof the Government and the Insurance companies have worked out plans for financing a nation-wide project involving about 10,000 houses, at a total cost ofabout $50,000,000.11. Among the visitors to Ottawa on their return from the San FranciscoConf erence were Prince Abdul, Regent of Iraq; Field-Marshal Smuts, PrimeMinister of South Africa; Viscount CranbOrne, Secretary of State for DominionAffairs; and M. Paul Boncour. Sir Alexander Fleming, scientist and discovererof penicillin, recently paid a short visit to Canada.* 12. Detailed figures of the Service voting in the recent Canadian GeneralElection (on the 11th June) are now given. They show, in round figures, thefollowing : &apos;Liberal ...................      118,000C.C.F. (Labour)        ...............      110,000Progressive Conservative    ...       ...      ...       ...        88,000Social Credit ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        11,000Others............      .........        16,00013. Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, who has lived in Canada for thepast five years, left with her three daughters for Holland during the month. Heryoungest child was born in Canada.14. The King has approved the appointment of Field-Marshal Sir HaroldAlexander to succeed the Earl of Athlone as Governor-General of Canada.
15. An important Dominion Provincial Conference has been summoned tomeet on the 6th August to consider the constitutional relationships between theProvincial and Federal Governments.Economic.16. On the 6th July the Prime Minister of Canada announced that meatwas to be rationed again, in order to reduce consumption and thus permit of anincrease in supplies for export; a recent review of world food requirements ofthe United Nations [i.e., that carried out by United States, United Kingdomand Canadian representatives at Washington last spring] had shown a greatneed for immediate action on the part of the countries which were in a positionto assist. It is understood that the ration will allow 1J lb. per person ofboneless meat (approximately 2 lb. carcase weight), and that almost all meats(cooked meats, offals, &amp;c.) will be included, except poultry. Meatless days willbe enforced in all eating places, restaurants, &amp;c, on. Tuesdays and Fridays.Although, for administrative reasons, the domestic rationing is not expected tobecome operative until some time in September, the control of slaughter, designedto channel stock as far as possible through inspected slaughter-houses and thusenable the Meat Board to obtain larger supplies for export, was put into effect immediately. On the proposed ration, Canadian consumption of meat will, itis estimated, be reduced from the present level of 147 lb. per head per annum to130 lb., both figures being inclusive of offals.Service A c tivi ties.17. H.M.C.S. Uganda (cruiser) took part in operations carried out byunits of the British Pacific Fleet in the month of July, while, in addition, other ships of the Royal Canadian Navy took part in various operations. Details ofthese have not yet been received.18. Canada&apos;s second cruiser, HM.C.S. Ontario, was recently commissionedat Belfast and has successfully completed her trials. The Ontario, which carriesa complement of nearly 900 officers and men was to head Canada&apos;s Navy inthe Pacific.19. Canadian military forces continued to carry out occupational duties in North-West Europe.20. Canadian troops entered Berlin on the 4th July as part of the Britishoccupation forces. An incident which attracted some publicity occurred whenthe Russian guards refused the Canadian troops entry, although they hadalready examined the credentials of the British officers leading the convoy. TheRussians maintained that the Canadians should have separate authority, andit was only after permission had been received from the Soviet Headquarters inBerlin, and.after a 2-J-hour delay, that Canadian troops were allowed to enter the city.21. The Department of National Defence have announced that a total ofat least 126,000 Armed Services personnel will be repatriated during theremainder of 1945. Although the military authorities have expressed the hopeof increasing the percentage to be returned during the months of July and august thej&apos;&apos; have stated that they do not expect that the overall total will be larger than the above figure. This will leave approximately 125,000 army personnel overseas in addition to the occupation force of 35,000.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.22. The outstanding event during the month was the death of the PrimsMinister. Mr. Curtin&apos;s health which, as reported previously, had been causingdisquiet throughout June, gradually became worse, and on the 5th July Australiawas plunged in mourning for his untimely death. The Governor-General, the duke of Gloucester, who was visiting Australian troops in New Guinea, curtailedhis visit and returned to Canberra by air on receiving the news of Mr. Curtin&apos;sdeath. Numerous tributes to Mr. Curtin&apos;s personality and work were receivedfrom many countries. In Australia his passing was deeply mourned by all sections of the community.23. Mr. J. B. Chifley, Commonwealth Treasurer, was elected to succeedMr. Cur tin, and became the fifteenth Prime Minister of Australia, and the sixth[30402] b 2
Labour member to hold this office, on the 13th July. The Federal Caucus electedhim as leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party by 45 votes against24 cast for his three opponents, Mr. F. M. Forde (who becomes Deputy Leader),Mr. N. J. O. Makin, and Dr. IT. V. Evatt. Consequent ministerial changes include a new portfolio, that of Housing, which has been given to Mr. Lazzarini, Ministerof Works; Mr. Calwell has been made Minister of Immigration, and Mr. H. V.Johnston, Minister of the Interior. In his first speech as Prime Minister,Mr. Chifiey said on the 15th July that the Australian Labour Party no longerstood for isolation. The immediate paramount problem of the Government wouldbe to obtain peace in the Pacific and thereafter to ensure that Australians islandfringe could never again be used as bases by any potential enemies.24. Dr. H. V. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, in a statement to thepress on the 29th July, protested that the Potsdam ultimatum to Japan was published without prior reference to, still less with the concurrence of, theAustralian Government. The ultimatum, he said, was of fundamental importanceto Australia, and in its terms appeared to treat Japan more leniently than Germany. Before final and definite decisions were taken, &quot;nations like Australia,which have been most active in the war, are also entitled to participate through their accredited representatives in all the relevant deliberations and conferences.&quot;In the particular case of the ultimatum to Japan, Dr. Evatt thought that this principle had been departed from.25. Shorter hours and higher pay for native labourers in New Guinea andPapua are promised by the Minister for External Territories, Mr. Ward, whenhe introduced a bill to provide a provisional administration for Papua and that part of New Guinea now cleared of the Japanese. He added that Australia, asproposer of the principle of trusteeship for dependent peoples in the world security Charter, aimed to set an example in the handling of its territories.26. The Second Banking Bill, which continues war-time control over the trading banks in Australia, passed through the remaining stages in the Houseof Representatives, and the Senate. One amendment made during the passageof the Bill empowers the High Court to order the Commonwealth Bank to relinquished-quish control of a trading bank, the financial position of which has improved.27. The Bill to nationalise all inter-State airlines in Australia was intro-duced into the House of Representatives by the Minister of Air, Mr. Drakeforcl,who said that in future all inter-State airlines would be controlled by theAustralian National Airlines Commission. Speaking in the House of Represen-tatives on the 25th July, Mr. Menzies, the Leader of the Opposition, and a formerPrime Minister, characterised the Government Bill for the nationalisation ofairlines as a gross violation of Mr. CurthVs pledge at the 1943 election that noindustry would be socialised in war-time, a pladge, Mr. Menzies said, that had won many thousands of non-labour votes for the Government.28. The Post-War Reconstruction Minister, Mr. Dedman, has announcedthat the Federal Government intends to enter the field of education and that a commonwealth Office of Education will be set up in Canberra. Australia, whichat present has six universities, is to have a National University at Canberra.This is to be set up &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;29. A Bill has been introduced whereby Australian women who have con-tracted war marriages with United States servicemen, or anyone else from over-seas, will be able to institute divorce proceedings in Australia. The Bill appliesonly to war-time marriages.30. Of 13,800 casualties suffered by the R.A.A.F. since the war began,6,500 occurred in Europe and 4,700 in the South-West Pacific.31. The Australian Army&apos;s operational strength is to be reduced from itspresent six divisions to three divisions and the Air Force from 53 squadrons to probably 36 squadrons.32. The Commonwealth War Gratuities Bill, which provides for the pay-ment, irrespective of rank, of 75s. for each month of service overseas with the armed forces, and for 15s. for each month of service in Australia, has passed thesecond reading. All parties favoured an increase in the rate of payment for service in Australia.33. It was announced in the Senate on behalf of the Treasurer that WarSavings Certificates and National Savings Bonds worth  A.865 million had been
sold since 1941. Stocks and bonds issued with conversion of matured securitiesfor the same period amounted to  A. 187 million. In the House of Representa-tives the Prime Minister stated that war expenditure in the year 1944-45(30th June) was  A. 460 million, of which  A. 194 million was met from revenue.The balance had been met by loans.Economic.34. The drought in Australia has now definitely broken, intermittent rainshaving followed the first substantial fall which occurred during the latter partof June over the whole southern portion of the Commonwealth. Good rains havealso fallen in Queensland and in Eastern New South Wales. The rains havebeen in general accompanied by mild weather, instead of by the frost and coldusually encountered at this time of the year, and if these conditions continuewinter growths should be much stimulated. Stock mortality has begun to decline,and the rains have greatly improved the prospect of meat, dairying and wheatproduction and crops generally. Livestock losses and other effects of the droughthave, however, been serious and full recovery is bound to take a considerable time.To take an immediate example, the export of fat lambs in the coming season isnot expected to reach half the level reached last season. There has also been atemporary setback in some areas caused by severe flooding.Service Activities.35. Oh the 1st of the month H.M.A. cruisers Shropshire and Hobart, and h.M.A. destroyer Arunta formed part of the force which carried out a bombard-ment prior to the Borneo landing, while H.M.A. ships Westralia, Manoora andKanimbla (L.S.I. large) assisted in the landing of Australian troops in this area.36. On the 17th H.M.A.S. Quickmatch formed part of the screening force during the attack on Hitachi area in the Japanese Islands, while in additionH.M.A. destroyers Napier, Norman, Nepal, Nizam and Quiberon formed part ofthe British Pacific Fleet during its operations off Japan.37. In the Solomon Islands enemy positions and gun emplacements onSohana Island, Buka Island and Bougainville were shelled on three occasions byR.A.N. frigates including H.M.A.S. Diamantina.38. In New Guinea troops of the 6th Australian Division resumed theiroffensive, and- after taking several villages in the Wewak and Maprik areas hadby the 15th captured enemy positions on the Prince Alexander Ranges overlookingthe former town. On Bougainville Island in the Southern Sector, troops of the3rd Australian Division again went over to the offensive when strong opposition was encountered north of the Buin road. Australian troops then consolidatedtheir position on the west bank of the Mibo River, where they were later stronglycounter-attacked by Japanese forces which were generally repulsed, but smallparties of which managed to infiltrate to a depth of 12 miles behind the front line.39. On Borneo in the Brunei Bay Sector troops of the 9th AustralianDivision advanced steadily, and established a firm line covering 200 miles ofseaboard, while Labuan Island was cleared of the enemy and the oilfields of Miriand Seria came under Australian control. On Tarakan mopping up continued,while in the Balikpapan area despite strong enemy counter-attacks troops of the7th Australian Division cleared the town in the early days of the month, and thereafter steadily advanced to clear both sides of the bay.40. Five R.A.A.F. Squadrons moved forward to join those already operating from Labuan Island in Borneo, while four have joined other Squadrons alreadyoperating from airfields in the Tarakan and Balikpapan areas.NEW ZEALAND.41. In the by-election at Dunedin North, the Government retained the seatby a majority of 738. In the 1943 General Election the Government majority was2,800, and in 1938, 3.500. The result is interpreted by the Leader of the Opposi-tion as a big swing aaginst the Government, and as being particularly significantin a constituency which has been regarded as a Labour stronghold. Most-newspapers endorse this view.
42. The return of the Prime Minister (Mr, Fraser), from the San FranciscoConference was made the occasion for numerous tributes to his work while there.At a civic reception at Wellington on the 11th July, the Prime Minister said that,while giving their full place to the large Powers, &quot; I was-not inclined to be silentwhen they put forward proposals, which in our opinion were not in the spirit of democracy for which our men fought.&quot; When reporting to Parliament on thework of the Nbav Zealand Delegation to San Francisco, the Prime Minister, in his speech, mentioned that New Zealand would be expected to conclude an agreementplacing the Mandated territory of Western Samoa under the trusteeship systemestabished by the Charter. He urged the ratification of the Charter by the NewZealand Parliament.43. Mr. Nash, Minister for Finance, said on the 12th July that newreciprocal trade agreements with British Empire countries were shortly to beexpected. New Zealand haped also that they might be able to send more goods to the United States than they had done in the past.44. The Minister of Agriculture mentioned in Parliament on the 13th Julythat the estimated New Zealand output of butter fat for 1945 was 193,000 tons,as compared with 191,500 tons, the annual average over the past five years. Theestimate of wool production was 166,000 tons, which consituted a record. Meatproduction had greatly increased during the war years, the average being526,000 tons annually, against 470,000 in pre-war years.45. The Parliamentary Assistant to the Prime Minister stated in Parlia-ment on the 12th July that the Banks in New Zealand held  250 million againstthe New Zealand Exchange post in London of  60 million, &quot; a larger volume of purchasing power than ever before.&quot;46. The retirement of the United Kingdom High Commissioner, Sir HarryBatterbee, was made the occasion of numerous valedictory references by all sectionsof the press. He has been succeeded by Sir Patrick Duff, who has now assumedoffice.47.   The strength of the Royal New Zealand Navy as at the 30th June was9,477 men and 510 women, of the former of which 5,635 were serving abroa,d.48. During the first half of the month the Second New Zealand Divisioncontinued to carry out occupational duties in the Trieste area, but towards theend of the month was withdrawn from this sector and moved down to the vicinity of Spoletto. *49. The strength of the New Zealand military forces as at the 30th june was 52,739 men and 2,553 women, of the former of which 38,649 were serving abroad and of the latter 668.50. Of New Zealand fighter squadrons stationed abroad at the end of themonth four were on Bourgainville Island, two at Jacquinot Bay in New Britain,one at Los Negros and one on Emirau Island.51. Nos. 15, 18, 23 and 24 fighter squadrons of the R.N.Z.A.F. mentionedabove and based on Bougainville operated in support of the Australian ground forces carrying out offensive operations in this area while Nos. 19 and 20 squadronsbased at Jacquinot Bay carried out straffing and bombing missions against enemy positions on New Britain and New Ireland.52.   Of the three R.N.Z.A.F. bomber reconnaissance squadrons operating inthe Pacific area No. 1 is stationed in New Zealand, No. 2 at Jacquinot Bay in new Britain and No. 3 on Emirau Island and the two latter were mainly occupiedattacking targets on New Britain and New Ireland in support of Australian !ground forces operating in these areas.53.   Strength of the R.N.Z.A.F. as at the 30th June was 27,850 men, and2,375 women, of the former 8,354 were abroad.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.i54. The Prime Minister, Field-Marshal Smuts, received a great welcome on Ihis return to South Africa from San Francisco and London, on the 16th July!In an interview he said that the date for the Union&apos;s ratification of the United INation&apos;s Agreement had not yet been fixed, nor had a decision been taken as torn
whether there shall be a special session of Parliament this year. Speaking ofthe Conference itself he said that the peace wdiich was to follow &quot; will be a far more difficult affair than San Francisco.&quot; At a banquet at Lourenco Marques,Field-Marshal Smuts referred to the Union&apos;s native question, and said : &quot; Thereis one field in particular in which I believe the States and territories of SouthAfrica can make a significant contribution to human progress. I am thinking of that great complex of problems which concern the relationship between Avhiteand black in the sub-continent. The black people in every territory are beingirresistibly drawn into the orbit of the white man&apos;s industry, and by so doing,the structure of their indigenous institutions is crumbling away. We in SouthAfrica are evolving a new synthesis in which the interests of both will findexpression.&quot;55. The United party has shown great relief at the decision of the Labourleaders to postpone the question of secession from the Government until theAnnual Conference of the Labour Party in December or January. The congress of the Labour party early this year had agreed to review the question of continuedcollaboration with the United party immediately the war in Europe ended. now that Labour is committed to stay in the Coalition until the end of the year, themore responsible United party organisations are stressing the benefits of collaboration.56. The extreme Nationalist organisation, Ossewa Brandwag, is building a  125,000 publishing house for the purpose of publishing a daily newspaperand several weeklies. In a recent issue of their present journal, an. Ossewa Brand-wag leader admitted that this organisation had used violent methods during thewar, but that the time had now come &quot; to change their fighting methods.&quot;57. &quot; The Republican Fighting Funds,&quot; built up by the Nationalist party,have now been registered as an Investment Company, with the Nationalist party leaders, Dr. D. F. Malan, J. G. Strydom and General J. D. Kemp as directors. TheOpposition^ anti-Communist &quot; Crusade &quot; is already wearing thin, and Nation-alist party papers are no longer over-stressing the idea. The Party&apos;s congress on the 18th September is likely to turn away from the &quot; Red bogy &quot; towards theold familiar racial issues of South African politics, although the purpose of theCongress is to &quot; consider the Communist danger, and the fight against it.&quot;58. There has been criticism of demobilisation delays, and the ActingMinister of Defence, Mr. Sturrock, has issued a press statement that the demobili-sation now in operation is only partial, as final demobilisation will not take placeuntil after the Avar against Japan has ended. The policy of the Government isto release all men in the Union who apply to return to verified pre-enlistnientemployment, provided that their services are no longer required.59. The housing shortage in South Africa is still a cause for general corn-plaint against local and national authorities. The Minister of Welfare,Mr. Lawrence, has drawn attention to the work now starting on the erection of3,000 houses on the Rand, and 6,000 in other.parts of the Union and predictedthat the housing problem Avill be solved within eighteen months.60. The Minister of Justice, Mr. Stoyn, has announced that the SouthAfrican Police Force is to be reorganised and strengthened. Recruiting will be largely from the ranks of returned soldiers.61. A proposal that a National Trust Fund for African health servicesbe formed, as a^outh African Avar memorial, is welcomed by the press. Thesuggestion is that voluntary subscriptions should be. raised by soldiers to providethe nucleus of the fund for founding a series of native clinics throughout the reserves and other areas of dense native populations.Service Activities.62. The Sixth South African Armoured Division continued to carry outoccupational duties in Northern Italy.63. Six S.A.A.F. Bomber Squadrons were operational in the central mediterranean. Two equipped with Liberators were based on Celone, threeequipped with Marauders were stationed at Rivolto, Avhile one equipped withBaltimores operated from Villaorba.
64. Eight S.A.A.F. fighter, reconnaisanee or ground attack, squadrons were also operational in this theatre, while, in addition, two S.AA.F. Dakota transportsquadrons came under command.65. One Sunderland flying boat squadron of the S.A.A.F. was operationalunder Air Command, South-East Asia, and was based on Durban, while twoground reconnaissance squadrons were reforming at Gianacles in Egypt underMiddle East Command.EIRE.66. Under the Offences Against the State Act, the Eire Government issuedan order on the 24th July enabling them to intern Eire citizens without trial.An official statement said that the Government are satisfied that there powers were necessary to ensure the preservation of peace and order. In a statement in the Dail, Mr. de Valera explained that, although the Emergency Pow-ers Act,which conferred similar powers for the duration of the war, had been allowed tolapse, it was necessary to retain these powers in order to deal with the ERA.,which he described as an &quot; an illegal organisation.&quot;Defining his statement &quot;that Eire is a Republic,&quot; Mr. de Valera said inthe Dail on the 17th July : &quot; The position as I conceive it to be is this : We are an independentrepublic associated as a matter of our external policy with the States ofthe British Commonwealth. To mark this association we avail ourselves ofthe procedure of the External Relations Act, by which the King recognised by these States of the British Commonwealth therein named acts for us underadvice in certain specified matters, in the field of our external relations.&quot;Mr. de Valera wrent on to say that when the present constitution of Eirewas adopted in 1937 the United Kingdom Government issued a statement thatthey were prepared to treat the new constitution as not effecting a fundamentalalteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a member of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.   He observed : &quot; We can only accept the British Governments statement as the expres-sion of a view taken by them in full knowledge of our position here at thetime, and there has been, as everyone is aware, no constitutional or otherchange wdiich wauld alter the situation since then.&quot;Economic.67. Replying to assertions in the Dail by the Opposition that Eire&apos;s sterlingassets ought to be written down by 50 per cent., Mr. de Valera stated that theirpolicy was to make the country as independent as possible of the British market;but that at present Britain was almost their only market for agricultural produce;and that, htrefore, if they wanted to export they had to do so on credit.68. For the five months January to April, Eire&apos;s imports were valued at13-6 millions compared wuth 11-8 millions for the same period of last year.Exports totalled nearly 14 millions compared with 11 millions for the sameperiod in 1944. In each year practically the wdiole of her exports went to GreatBritain (including Northern Ireland). About 50 per cent, of her imports werederived from Great Britain and the bulk of the balance from Canada, the UnitedStates and Brazil.NEWFOUNDLAND.69. After more than four years&apos; service overseas, in the course of whichthey took part in the fighting in Italy, France and Germany, the Newfoundland59th and 166th Artillery Regiments are returning home on demobilisation. Some400 members of the Newfoundland Forestry Unit, which has been working inthis country since the early days of the war, have also been repatriated following the termination of their contracts, but more than 700 men have signed on for. further work in the United Kingdom for varying periods up to the end ofMarch 1946.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.70. The one dominant event on the Indian political stage in July wasthe breakdown of the Simla Conference which the Viceroy was obliged to announceon the 14th of the month. The Conference failed because it did not achievethat general agreement which His Majesty&apos;s Government had stated to be a necessary condition of carrying out their proposals for the reconstitution ofthe Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council. The actual cause of the breakdownwas Mr. Jinnah&apos;s refusal to co-operate save on his own terms, his fundamentalcondition being one which the Viceroy could not accept, viz., that all Moslems inthe reconstituted Council should belong to the Moslem League.71. Only one section of political opinion expressed any jubilation at thefailure of the Conference the Hindu Mahasabha, to whom the proposed parity of representation between Moslems and Caste Hindus was anathema. The generaldisappointment was all the keener in that the Conference had come so near success;the initial difficulties had been overcome, the party leaders had been broughtround the table, and the broad principles of His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals had been accepted. Subsequent statements by the various leaders have shown some respect for the Viceroy&apos;s advice that recrimination should be avoided.72. No further developments occurred in July, the disposition being to await the results of the Conference which it was announced the Viceroy would holdwith Provincial Governors early in August. Press opinion reflected the wide-spread anxiety for an early settlement and the determination not to let mattersrest with the failure of the Simla Conference.Indian States.73. The Standing Committee of the Chamber of Princes (which is mainlyrepresentative of the medium-sized States) resigned en bloc last December asa result of their dissatisfaction with the Viceroy&apos;s reply to their representations on various questions, including the interpretation of their &quot; Treatjf Rights&quot;and their demand for the acceptance of the principle of compulsory arbitrationon matters in dispute between the Crown and a State. Little actual inconveniencewas caused to the Crown Representative by the consequent suspension of theChamber machinery, and the Princes as a whole now probably consider theCommittee&apos;s tactics (for which the Nawab of Bhopal, as Chancellor of theChamber, was mainly responsible) to have been ill-judged. The resignationswere withdrawn, and. the Viceroy agreed-to save the Committee&apos;s face toreceive a Deputation of Princes. But it is unlikely that anything can be done to satisfy the more conservative elements on the issues they previously raised.Frontier and Foreign Relations.74.   The North-West Frontier. Nothing of importance to report.75. A fghardstan. The Afghan Government asked for written guaranteesfrom the Allies that the members of the former- German Legation, who are being-repatriated through the U.S.S.R., should reach some place in Germany underjoint-Allied control. The proposal was impracticable since the Germans wouldbe in Russian hands during repatriation and such a guarantee could not, therefore,be given. The Soviet Charge d&apos;Affair.es was, however, authorised by hisGovernment to say that they would be sent direct to Germany to a place underjoint-control of the Allied Governments and it was hoped that the AfghanGovernment would be satisfied with these assurances.76. A disturbance in the Eastern Province prompted the Afghan &quot;WarMinister to request that the delivery of military equipment should be expedited.The Government of India in consequence are making arrangements to supplyimmediately a portion of the requirements without waiting to settle the financialdetails.77. Sinkiang. Two caravans containing export cargoes from the Provincearrived in India during the month. The export trade from Sinkiang to india has been almost at a standstill for several years and it is unlikely to be revivedto any large extent yet,* [30402] c
- 78. Persian Gulf. Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd.,a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, have recently obtained oil con-cessions from the Rulers of the petty Trucial Sheikhdoms of Umm-al-Qaiwainand Ras-al-Khaimah. The agreements are subject to the approval of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.Economic.79. Artificial Fertilisers. A technical mission appointed in April 1944 toadvise on the production of artificial fertilisers in India reported to the Govern-ment of India in November of that year in favour of the establishment inIndia of a plant to manufacture 350,000 tons per annum of sulphate of ammonia.Having considered the report, the Government of India decided, after consultationwith the Indian Provinces and States, to proceed with the erection of a plantof the above capacity at Sindri in Bihar. In furtherance of this decision theGovernment of India sent a Mission to the United Kingdom to negotiate, initiallyhere and subsequently in the United States, competitive tenders for the plantrequired. After four months&apos; investigation in this country the Government ofIndia Mission reached the conclusion that in the best interests of India, Anglo-American collaboration would provide a design for the1 plant based on theexperience of both countries while retaining for supply from the sterling area the maximum quantity of plant required to be imported to establish the new factory. Proposals on these lines have been placed before the Government ofIndia by their Mission.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.80. H.M.I.S. Godavari and H.M.I.S. Na?&apos;bada maintained patrols in theAndaman Sea.81. H.M.I.S. Llanstephan Castle was employed in the transport of troopsbetween Madras and Rangoon.82. Part of the 37th R.I.N. M/S Flotilla arrived at Aden and commencedsweeping operations off Massawa and Assab.83. Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron issued instructions that allmerchant shipping in the Indian Ocean is to proceed undarkened and withnavigational lights at full brilliancy.Military.84. Burma. The main operations throughout the month were directed to dealing with the attempted break out eastwards from the Pegu Yomas of the remnants of the Japanese Army, which had collected there. They attempted to cross the Mandalay-Rangoon Road along a 77-mile stretch running south fromToungoo in groups of about 500. Just south of Toungoo they had a smallmeasure of success, and about 1,000 managed to get across and split into small groups. Casualties inflicted by the 12th Army and Irregular Forces amounted to nearly 7,000 killed and over 600 taken prisoners of war. Such as crossed the roadstill had the obstacle of the Sittang River, held by Imperial and Irregular Forces,to contend with before they could reasonably call themselves safe. Enemy attempts to cause diversions by crossing the Sittang River from east to west, with a view tothreatening Pegu, and by small attacks along the Mawchi Road east of Toungoocannot be said to have been successful. Further north on the road east from Thaziour troops made good progress beyond Heho and reached Taunggyi.Air.85. In spite of the appalling weather conditions the air effort against theJapanese trying to cross the road and in support of our troops over the whole ofthe front was maintained.86. The flying into the forward areas of supplies and troops and theevacuation of casualties was continued. Bad weather greatly interfered withphotographic reconnaissance, but cover of the Tenasserim Coast and partial cover of the Burma-Siam and Bangkok-Chiengmai Railways were obtained.General.87. Morale. There were continued allegations by British troops that insufficient publicity is given in the United Kingdom to the war against Japan,and particularly to the operations in Burma.
88. Exemption from conscription of age groups over 30 before the end ofthe national emergency is deprecated by the majority of British troops.89. Army Education. Reports have shown that Indian troops&apos; apprecia-tion of education has grown into a demand for even greater instructional activitieson the same lines as British troops.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.90. Enemy Occupied Burma. There are no important developments toreport.91. Liberated Burma. The Anti-Fascist People&apos;s Independence League hasbeen very active in forming local branches over most areas of Liberated Burma.It is now emerging as a Communist organisation and is an up-to-date version ofthe old Thakin party; it aspires to be the main political power in Liberated Burma.It is interesting to note that the Karens and the Arakanese have disassociatedthemselves from the movement and are endeavouring to set up their own Indepen-dence Movements.92. The first monthly report on the rice situation in Burma states that millsin the Akyab and Shwebo area are meeting local needs and as more transportbecomes available it is expected that the small surplus will increase. In theDelta area it is estimated that about one-third of the mills are working and 1,000tons a day is being milled. It is hoped that this will be increased to 75,000 amonth when the remaining mills, which are mainly lacking in spare parts, have got into action.93. Much useful work on publicity is being done in Liberated Burma butthis is hampered by the difficulties of distribution. Nevertheless bundles of publicity material are being sent to outlying places by any means available,including officers on tour, Army postal services, &amp;c. The question of using airlift for dropping papers and leaflets is being investigated. Mr. Hughes, the governors Representative, and General Ranee, the Chief Civil Affairs Officer,held a Press Conference in Rangoon in early July, which they felt to have beena success and to have done much to clear the air.94. An interesting report on the general feeling of the people in theMandalay and Sagaing districts states that the return of the British is welcomedand the freedom allowed under the British is more than ever appreciated after three years under the Japanese. There is, however, some disappointment andimpatience over relief measures, born perhaps of excessive hopes about what wouldbe possible, and some bewilderment over the policy of organisations concerned with security and &quot; Collaborators.&quot;THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note, Jn this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.95. Mauritius. No supplies of rice have reached Muritius since the fall of burma. Rice is the staple food of the Indian community living in that colony and, whilst hitherto they have been able to make shift with alternative cereals, thetime has come when it is essential from the points of view of morale and nutritionthat they should get some rice if there is to be a successful reaping of the sugarcrop this year. Reaping is due to start almost immediately. Although the worldshortage of rice is well known to be critical, I have been able, with the co-operationof the Minister of Food, to arrange for the supply of a special cargo of 5,000 tons from Egypt, which is due to load in the last days of July.[30402] d
Defence.96. Caribbean Regiment (see June report, paragraph 2). Since the Armyhave no further operation need of this Regiment the Air Ministry have asked the War Office and the Colonial Office whether there would be any objection totheir calling for volunteers from its members for service in the R.A.F. TheWest Indian Governors have been asked their views on this suggestion andreactions have been uniformly favourable.97. British Borneo. The 9th Australian Division now hold an area in north-East Borneo covering nearly 200 miles of seaboard from North of Paparto South of Miri, and valuable gains include the harbour and installations ofBrunei Bay, airstrips of Labuan Island, oil-fields and refineries in the States ofBrunei and Sarawak and the southern base of Miri. These areas also containmuch of the richest rubber-producing country.98. Patrols from Papar on the Beaufort-Jesselton railway have reached apoint 8 miles to the East without making contact with the enemy. In other areas only scattered contacts by patrols are reported.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.99. With the decrease in sensational reports from the Levant States andwith expectations of an amicable settlement there, there has been less publicinterest in events across the border.100. It became necessary for the High Commissioner to dissolve the jerusalem Municipality. The proper representation of the Jewish and Arabcommunities on the Municipal Council has been a matter of dissension for manyyears. Events were brought to a head by the death last summer of the ArabMayor. This led to the Jewish Deputy Mayor taking office. The Mayor of jerusalem has always been an Arab and, consequently, the Arab Councillorsceased to attend meetings. There was no longer, therefore, a quorum for the transaction of business, and the High Commissioner accordingly dissolved theCouncil and appointed a Commission to administer the affairs of the Municipalityfor the time being while Sir William Fitzgerald, the Chief Justice, holds an enquiry and makes recommendations for the future government of the city. this action led to protests from both the Arab and the Jewish communities.101. Many of the leading members of the Jewish community have come toEngland for a conference of Zionists from all over the world, which was due tomeet in London at the beginning of August.  -102. In the 13th July a lorry load of explosives was ambushed by Jewishterrorists, the British constable escorting it was murdered and the lorry drivenoff. On the 25th July a bridge on the Haifa-Kantara railway was blown up and damaged. Traffic was restored on the same day after temporary repairs. Thesedeplorable incidents show that the danger of outrages by Jewish extremists isnot yet over. During the month the police carried out 55 raids in the search for terrorists and 45 persons were detained. The total number detained atpresent is about 425. Detonators, powder, gelignite and anti-personnel bombs were seized during the month.103. The housing situation in Palestine is very acute, particularly in TelAviv where there have been many cases of forcible entry of unoccupied premises.Emergency measures are being taken to deal with a very difficult situation whichis being accentuated by the arrival of new immigrants and the return ofdemobilised soldiers.Nigeria.Strike of Technical Workers.104. The Acting Governor of Nigeria has reported that the Africantechnical workers employed in Government Departments, who have been on an unofficial strike since the 21st June, returned to work on the 7th August. Itis expected that the men will now pursue their demands in a constitutionalmanner, but it is not yet known exactly what form the negotiations are likelyto take.
105. Earlier during the strike, the Nigerian Government had found itnecessary to take action against certain local newspapers, following a series ofmisrepresentations of the facts regarding the strike. These misrepresentationscontinued after due warning had been given and culminated in the publicationby the newspapers, West African Pilot and Daily Comet, of a statement alleged to have been made by the Government Public Relations Officer, accusing thetrade union leaders of &quot;incapability and total inability to guide their followersalong the right path.&quot; No such statement had been made by the public relations Officer and its publication was clearly calculated to discredit theunion leaders at a time when some of them were making every effort to persuadestrikers to return to work and to follow constitutional means of settling thedispute. After a full enquiry, the Acting Governor ordered the suspension ofthe newspapers concerned. The retention of this ban is being reconsidered in thelight of the changed circumstances.106. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who controls both the newspapers concerned, hasbeen sending telegrams to labour organisations in all parts of the world, allegingthat the Nigerian Government is considering his deportation and that his lifeis endangered, and appealing for support. There is, of course, no substance in either of these allegations, but the appeals have evoked some response,particularly from organisations in the United States sympathetic to Negroaspirations and from Labour organisations in the West Indies; Steps have beentaken to make the true facts known.Ceylon.107. Mr. D. S. Senanayake, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Ministers andLeader of the State Council of Ceylon, is in London at the invitation of theSecretary of State for discussions on the question of constitutional reform andcertain economic matters of importance to the Island&apos;s main industries.M auritius.108. Sir Donald Mackenzie-Kennedy, the Governor of Mauritius, arrived in the United Kingdom on the 6th July for discussions on constitutional reform in Mauritius and other matters.Gibraltar.109. The first elections for the reconstituted City Council were held duringthe month. Under the new Constitution, the Council consists of seven elected members and six official members. Candidates supported by the Associationfor the Advancement of Civilian Rights were successful in securing all sevenseats. The Association^ policy is reported to include public meetings of theCouncil; limitation of the Governor&apos;s powers of veto; extension of social services;quicker fulfilment of the housing programme; and better wrages and conditions for Council employees.
