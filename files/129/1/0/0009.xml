THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT--&apos;--1-&apos;---; --:-a_Printed for the Cabinet&quot;.   August 1945.SECRET.Copy. No.,CP. (45) 109.V&amp;th August, 1945.///CABINET.PUBLICITY FOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH BRITISH NORTH BORNEO(CHARTERED) COMPANY.Memorandum by the, Secretary of State for the Colonies.AT their meeting on the 31st May, 1944,*&apos; the War Cabinet authorised my predecessor to open confidential discussions with the Court of Directors of theBritish North Borneo (Chartered) Company, with a view to coming to an under-standing as to the conditions on which the administration of North Borneowould be transferred from the Company&apos;s responsibility and control to that ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Discussions between members of the Colonial Office and representativesof the Chartered Company have been proceeding since that date, and have now reached a stage where the latter appear ready to consider a financial settlement by arbitration. This solution had for some time been urged, with the concurrence of the Treasury, from the official side, but the Company&apos;s representatives had previously refused to consider it on the grounds that such a step would take thedecision out of their own hands on a matter on which they were responsible tothe Company&apos;s shareholders. Even now they insist that they are responsible to the shareholders not only as regards the principle of arbitration but also asto the terms of reference to be given to an arbitrator. They are now consideringdraft terms of reference handed to them by the Colonial Office at an earlier stage.3. Hitherto, the discussions have been conducted under a stipulation of secrecy. The Company&apos;s representatives, however, have throughout urged thedesirability of an official public statement, which would state clearly that negotiations are in progress, and would thus prevent the circulation, on the stock exchange and elsewhere, of irresponsible rumours which might have anunsettling effect on the Company&apos;s shares. The Company&apos;s representatives havecontended that continued secrecy is unfair to the shareholders, and have also expressed the fear that they themselves individually may be accused of using their exclusive knowledge to their own advantage.4. At the time of his departure from the Colonial Office my predecessorhad not acceded to the Company&apos;s request. I understand that my predecessorfelt that there might be some danger in making any disclosure as to His Majesty&apos;governments intentions regarding North Borneo alone, since this might leadto pressure for declarations regarding Malaya, which raised much more delicatepolitical and racial issues. Nevertheless, shortly before leaving office, he indicated to the President of the Court of Directors that he would be willing to make astatement in Parliament if the General Election were to result in the return ofthe Government with an effective majority.5. I have now inherited this problem, and I consider that the time has comefor a brief authoritative statement in general terms regarding our intention, inagreement with the Chartered Company, to assume direct responsibility for theGovernment of North Borneo. I feel that speculation about our future colonial policy elsewhere in Scuth-East Asia is in any case inevitable -indeed, a gooddeal of speculation about the political future of Malaya has already taken placein the columns of The Times. A- statement about North Borneo could take theform of an announcement by myself in answer to a Question in the House ofCommons, or of a statement by the President of the Court of Directors at the* W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions.[30334]
2Company&apos;s annual general meeting on the 28th of this month, or of both. Inmy view it would be appropriate that a statement should first be made in theHouse on the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I now ask for theapproval of my colleagues to this course. I attach as an Appendix to this paper the draft of an arranged Parliamentary Question and Answer.G. H. H.  &apos;Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,13th August, 1945.APPENDIX.Draft for arranged Parliamentary Question and Answer.Draft Question:&quot; To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he is considering any modification in the previous system of government in the State of north borneo on the liberation of that territory from the Japanese.&quot;Draft Answer:&quot; Yes, Sir. Discussions have been taking place between representatives ofmy department and the Court of Directors of the British North Borneo(Chartered) Company with a view to reaching agreement on the question of theassumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of direct responsibility for theadministration of the territory.&quot;
