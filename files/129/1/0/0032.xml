81,st Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1945.SECRET. Copy No. 5 0CP. (45) 132.29th August, 1945.CABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Report by the Lord Privy Seal, Chairman oe the colonial affairs Committee.AT the request of the Prime Minister the Colonial Affairs Committee have examined the proposals for constitutional reform, in Ceylon submitted byLord Soulbury&apos;s Commission.   I now submit the Report of the Committee.2. The Cabinet will remember that the Soulbury Commission was appointedby the War Cabinet on the 7th June, 1944, to examine the question of constitu-tional reform in Ceylon on the understanding that this did not involve any commitment by His Majesty&apos;s Government further to those contained in theDeclaration made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1943, the text of which is appended to this Report.*&apos;Qjhu^ZjL 3.   The recommendations of the Commission (the Report of which has beenj   -        separately circulated to the Cabinet) are briefly summarised below.   We are0jfaeMS&apos;       informed that they are based on extensive investigations in Ceylon, in the courseCaLcutuigzo -Qf which full opportunity has been given to all interested parties there to express their views on the future of the constitution.4. It is a matter of urgency to reach conclusions on these recommendationssince Mr. Senanayake, the Vice-Chairman of the Ceylon Board of Ministers andLeader of the State Council, is at present in London for discussions with theSecretary of State for the Colonies on the Ceylon constitutional position.Recommendations of the Soulbury Commission.5. The recommendations of the Soulbury Commission may very briefly besummarised as follows : (a) The existing system of Government in Ceylon, which dates from the donoughmore Commission of 1931 and of which the most prominentfeature was the establishment of certain Executive Committees underMinisters, has not worked well, and should come to an end.(b) It should be replaced by a system under which the Government of Ceylonwould consist of a Governor-General with the reserved powers set outin the Declaration of 1943, a Cabinet and a bi-cameral legislature.The Lower House would be elected as to 95 members of its House byuniversal suffrage, its further members being nominated to representthose communities (principally the European and Burgher) which have failed to secure adequate representation in the elections. The upper house would consist of 30 members, of whom 15 would be elected bythe Lower House and 15 nominated by the Governor-General in his discretion. Its powers would be broadly similar to those of the Houseof Lords. In particular, it would not be able to check, amend or delayany finance bill beyond one month, and it could delay any other billfor not more than two successive sessions.(c) The constitution would operate subject to the reservation  to HisMajesty&apos;s Government of special powers in respect of defence, external affairs, currency, and trade, transport and communications affectingany part of the Empire.* Annex.[30409] b
(d) Special safeg.uar.ds are contemplated for the minority communities, them principal &apos; of which are European, Ceylon Tamil,  Indian Tamil,Muslims and Burghers   .....(e) The public services and the subordinate judiciary would be appointed on the recommendation respectively of a Public Services Commissionand a Judicial Services Commission. These bodies would be socomposed as to ensure complete impartiality.6. We are in general satisfied, in the light of full discussions with theSecretary of State for the Colonies, that, subject to the points which are discussedbelow, the new constitution appears to provide a suitable measure of constitutional progress for Ceylon within the terms of the Declaration made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in 1943. We think it unnecessary to trouble the Cabinet with a review of its details. -.........-7. There is, however, one substantial point of policy which merits close examination. In their Declaration of 1943, His Majesty&apos;s Government laid it down that the final acceptance of any scheme of constitutional reform formulated by Ministers would be conditional, inter alia, on its acceptance by three-quarters of the members of the State Council. Ministers in fact formulated a schemewhich they subsequently withdrew. That scheme, while it no longer has theavowed support of Ministers, is in effect the declared background to many ofthe Soulbury recommendations. The question for decision is whether in thesecircumstances we shall insist on a three-quarters majority for the new constitu-tional proposals in the State Council or not.A rgarments for holding to a three-quarters majority in the State Council.8. (a) The principal argument for holding to the three-quarters majorityenvisaged in the Declaration of 1943 is its great importance from the point ofview of the minorities. The minorities are the problem of crucial significance in ceylon. They will undoubtedly apply a critical scrutiny to the effect on their position of any constitutional proposals. The requirement of a three-quartersvote in the State Council is one of the principal safeguards for them. Whilethe other safeguards embodied in the proposed constitution are substantial (chieflythe reserve powers of the Governor), they would not by themselves be likely to reassure minority feeling.(b) Much public attention has been attracted to the figure of three-quarterssince it figured in the Declaration of 1943. Minority opposition to its withdrawal and suspicion of the reasons underlying that withdrawal may be expected to be correspondingly sharp. .Arguments in favour of abandoning the three-quarters majority.9. In favour, on the other hand, of abandoning the three-quarters majority and of substituting some smaller but sufficient majority, e.g., two-thirds, coupled with a requirement that that majority should include the largest practicablenumber of members of the minority communities, the following considerationshave been urged upon us.(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government are in terms not bound by the Declarationof 1943 in this regard since the scheme under consideration is one devised by anindependent Commission and not by Ministers in Ceylon. There is no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should not approve a constitutional scheme suchas that now before the Cabinet so long as they are satisfied that it representsadequate safeguards for minority interests and is in other respects satisfactory.(b) The scheme put forward by Ministers for which alone under the 1943Declaration a three-quarters majority would have been requisite, was devised,we are informed, without consultation with the minorities.   The Soulbury Com-J mission, on the other hand, has been at special pains to acquaint itself withminority feeling. They have informed the Secretary of State for the Coloniesconfidentially that in their view it would be quite impracticable to insist upona three-quarters majority for the constitutional scheme which they have proposed.We understand in this connection that the Sinhalese majority in the State councils unlikely to vote solidly in any circumstances in favour of the Soulbury pro-ppsals. A minority of the Sinhalese members, which might be as much as one-third, would probably oppose those recommendations on the grounds that theydid not go far enough towards Dominion status.(c) Mr. Senanayake, whose assistance is, we are advised, essential if the Soulbury recommendations are to secure the approval of the State Council, has
made it clear that he would not be prepared to support those proposals if weinsist on the three-quarters majority. Failing his support and that of themajority party, there would be no prospect of general acceptance in Ceylon&apos; forthese proposals. In such circumstances any scheme to replace the Donoughmoreconstitution would have to be imposed from outside. The unhappy impressionwhich this would be likely to create needs no emphasis.(d) It would be most regrettable if insistence on our part on a three-quarters majority were to result in the rejection of the present recommendations and the imposition (even if this were easily practicable) of a constitution from outside. Sinhalese pressure for still more extensive concessions is reported to be growing. Time is running- against us, and the example of India and theconstitutional undertakings recently given to Burma have stimulated this demand,all the more so since the Sinhalese contrast their whole-hearted co-operation inthe war with the failure to co-operate of certain elements in India and Burma.Our Recommendation.10. We have carefully weighed the arguments on either side. The balance is a nice one. In the result we think it most important that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not themselves appear of their own volition to jettison thethree-quarters majority contemplated (though in different circumstances) by theDeclaration of 1943. We understand, however, that it is likely thatMr. Senanayake will himself raise this matter in his discussions with theSecretary of State for the Colonies. We recommend that the Secretary of Statebe given a discretion in that event to inform Mr. Senanayake that it should be his object to secure the maximum possible majority in the State Council for the Soulbury proposals; that that majority should preferably include the largest possible element of minority representation; and that on this understanding HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not necessarily insist on holding to the three-quarters majority of the Declaration of 1943.Miscellaneous Points.11. We have in addition considered certain other miscellaneous points.Our recommendations are as follows : (1) Consultation with the Government of India. We think that advantage should be taken of Lord wavell&apos;s presence in this country to acquaint him withthe general position in regard to the recommendations of the Soulbury Corn-mission and the action proposed on them.We recommend that the text of the Soulbury Report be made available tothe Governor-General of India and his Executive Council confidentially at thesame time as it is made available to the members of the Board of Ministers in ceylon, and that an appropriate interval, to be adjusted between the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for India, be given theGovernment of India to formulate their conclusions.(2) Defence. The Service Ministers inform us that they regard the provisions for defence embodied in the Soulbury Report as generally adequate and satisfactory.(3) Question of a change in the style of the &quot;Governor of Ceylon. SinhaleseMinisters, actuated by considerations of prestige, have urged that His Majesty&apos;representative in Ceylon should in future be styled Governor-General and notGovernor. The scheme put forward by Ministers but subsequently withdrawn bythem contemplated that the Governor of Ceylon should in future be a Governor-General. The Secretary of State for the Dominions has drawn our attention tothe embarrassing consequences which this might have. We accept the force ofthe considerations he has urged and we do not support the suggestion that the titleGovernor-General should be substituted for that of Governor.(4) Channel of communication between the Ceylon Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government. The Soulbury Commission, with a view to meetingSinhalese susceptibilities, have recommended that communications passing betweenthe Ceylon Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government should in appropriate cases be addressed to the Prime Minister of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom. Given general practice throughout the Empire and the constitutional position of the Governor and of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, we do not support this recommendation. We consider that as in the case of territories of comparable status communications should be addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-raent through the channel of the Governor of Ceylon and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.[30409]
12.- Subject to the points taken in paragraphs 10 and 11 above and tosuch further consideration of the details of the proposed constitution as mayin due course be called for, we recommend that the Secretary of State for theColonies be authorised to enter into confidential discussion with Mr. Senanayakeon the basis of the Soulbury Report as modified by our present proposals. It is,of course, understood that after these discussions have taken place the Secretaryof State for the Colonies will again report to the Cabinet and obtain approval to constitutional scheme which he may then wish to recommend before steps are taken to lay it before Parliament for consideration.A. G.Gwydyr House, S.W.1,28th August, 1945.ANNEX.Declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government.IN 1941 the following assurance was given to the Board of Ministers in ceylon : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under further consideration the question of Constitutional reform in Ceylon. The urgency and importanceof the reform of the Constitution are fully recognised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but before making decisions upon the present proposals for reform, concerning which there has been so little unanimity, but which areof such importance to the well-being of Ceylon, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould desire that the position should be further examined and made thesubject of further consultation by means of a Commission or Conference.This cannot be arranged under war conditions, but the matter will be taken up with the least possible delay after the war.&quot;After further consideration. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided thatit is in the general interest to give greater precision to the foregoing statement with the object of removing any doubts regarding His Majesty&apos;s governments intentions. Accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the governor to convey to the Board of Ministers the following message : &apos;1. &quot; The post-war re-examination of the reform of the Ceylon Constitution,to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, will be directed towardsthe grant to Ceylon by Order of His Majesty in Council, of full responsible government under the Crown in all matters of internal civil administration.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain control of the provision, con-struction, maintenance, security, staffing, manning and use of such defences,equipment, establishments and communications as His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmay deem necessary for the Naval, Military and Air security of the Common-wealth, including that of the Island, the cost thereof being shared between thetwo Governments in agreed proportions.3. Ceylon&apos;s relations with foreign countries and with other parts of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations will be subject to the control and directionof His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. The Governor will be vested wdth such powers as wall enable him, ifnecessary, to enact any direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to matters within the scope of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Declaration; and his assent to local measures upon these matters will be subject to reference to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.5. The present classes of reserved Bills in the Royal Instructions will be largely reduced under a new Constitution. Apart from measures affectingDefence and External Relations it is intended that these shall be restricted toclasses of Bills which (a) relate to the Royal Prerogative, the rights and property of His Majesty&apos;ssubjects not residing in the Island, and the trade and shipping of anypart of the Commonwealth;(b) have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community,and which in the Governor&apos;s opinion are likely to involve oppressionor unfairness to any community;(c) relate to currency.
6. The limitations contained in the preceding paragraph will not bedeemed to prevent the Governor from assenting in the King&apos;s name to any measurerelating to, and conforming with, any trade agreements concluded with; theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Ceylon with other parts of theCommonwealth. It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Island&apos;commercial relations should be settled by the conclusion of agreements, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be pleased to assist in any negotiations with thisobject.7. The framing&apos; of a Constitution in accordance with the terms of this declaration will require such examination of detail and such precision of definition as cannot be brought to bear so long as the whole of the energies ofthe service and other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government must remainfocussed on the successful prosecution of the war. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill, however, once victory is achieved, proceed to examine by suitable commissioner Conference such detailed proposals as the Ministers may in the meantime havebeen able to formulate in the way of a complete constitutional scheme, subjectto the clear understanding that acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of any proposals will depend First, upon His Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied that they arein full compliance with the preceding portions of this Statement; and%Secondly, upon their subsequent approval by three-quarters of all members of the State Council of Ceylon, excluding the officers of State andthe Speaker or other presiding officer.8. In their consideration of this problem His Majesty&apos;s Government have very fully appreciated and valued the contribution which Ceylon has made andis making to the war effort of the British Commonwealth and the United Nations,and the co-operation which, under the leadership of the&apos;Board of Ministers andthe State Council, has made this contribution effective.&quot;
