Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. (45) 147.\.th September, 1945CABINET.INDIAN DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION IN WASHINGTON.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.I HAVE received from the Foreign Office a memorandum (Annex I) datedthe 24th July from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington suggesting thatthe decision of the War Cabinet on the 3rd August, 1944 (W.M. (44) 100thConclusions, Minute 2), that no change should be made in the status of theIndian Agency General in Washington should be reconsidered. I understandthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regards the matter as urgent and would like the Cabinet to consider it before the 10th September. LordWavell has also informed me that he feels strongly that the question of Sir G. S.Bajpai being made a fully accredited Minister should be considered by theCabinet. In the Diplomatic Corps in Washington Sir Girja holds the substantiveposition of Counse^leV to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, but he has the local rank of minister and is by\?ourtesy accorded access to the American Secretary of Stateand to the President.2. Discussions on this subject have been proceeding over the past twoor three years, and the arguments for and against the proposal were fully setout in the memorandum submitted to the Coalition War Cabinet by Mr. Ameryand Mr. Eden on the 24th April, 1944 (W.P. (44) 221).3. In that paper my predecessor and the then Foreign Secretary, in agreementwith the present Viceroy and the Government of India, urged the consideration that India should be placed &apos;&apos; on the world stage, at least, as a Dominion withan independent diplomatic voice.&quot; They agreed with Lord Halifax that Indianself-respect would be increased by the- exchange of diplomatic representativeswith the United States, and endorsed the Government of India&apos;s view that itwould be better to train Indian diplomatists under British guidance ratherthan to be rushed at a later stage into conceding independent status when con-ventions between His Majesty&apos;s Government and India would be more difficultto establish. They therefore recommend that the Agency General of theGovernment of India in Washington should be made into an independentmission headed by a Minister Plenipotentiary.4. Hitherto, the difficulty has been felt that, so long as the Governor-General in Council is constitutionally subordinate to His Majesty&apos;s Government,particularly in the field of foreign policy, it is improper, and might even in somecases be embarrassing and dangerous, that the Government of India should havean independent representative accredited to a foreign Government, to whichhe might make representations divergent from the policy which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment seek to follow with that Government.5.   Against this objection it has been urged that: (a) the constitutional anomaly has existed ever since India became an originalmember of the League of Nations in her own name in 1919, and thatwell-established conventions have grown up which have succeeded inobviating embarrassments; and(b) the particular dangers foreseen in relation to the Washington proposal would be prevented by instructions proposed to be issued as a directiveto the Minister for India in the United States (Annex II) which lays[30456]Copy No.
down precisely the division of responsibilities in relation to Indiabetween that Minister and His Majesty&apos;s United KingdomAmbassador.6. The elevation of the Indian Agency General to the status of Legationwould, I understand, amount to the creation of a new Mission with the UnitedStates Government whose consent to receive it would need to be sought. Thereis no doubt little reason to apprehend that such consent would not be forthcoming;but the request for it might evoke an enquiry whether it signified any alterationof the constitutional position of the Government of India ms-d-vis His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom.7. The new point introduced into the discussion in the past four months isthat the elevation of the Agency General (and other similar posts) was announced in the statement of policy of the 14th June last (which formed the basis of theSimla negotiations) as conditional on, and the consequence of, the acceptance by Indian non-official political leaders of the responsibilities of membership ofthe Governor-Generaks Executive Council, including specifically that of handlingIndia&apos;s external relations.8. The question to be decided, therefore, is whether, despite the rejection of the offer contained in the Statement of the 14th June, the proposal should be proceeded with now, in view of the support given to it by Lord Halifax andLord Wavell.9. In my view the arguments in favour of this proposal are sufficiently strong and I accordingly recommend it for approval.10. If my colleagues support this view it would follow that similar action should be taken with the Chinese Government in respect of. the Indan AgencyGeneral at Chungking. I understand that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would see no objection to this consequential step.P.-L.India Office,ith September, 1945.ANNEX I.Indian Diplomatic Representation in Washington.IN view of the present constitutional position of India, the Indian Agent-General in Washington, who enjoys the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and minister Plenipotentiary, is accredited to the United States Government as amember of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador&apos;s staff, and he and his secretaries areincluded in the Washington Diplomatic List among the staff of the british embassy. They nevertheless deal directly with the State Department on Indianmatters and in practice their position regarding day-to-day diplomatic work isthe same as that of the Dominion representatives and their staffs.The Indian Agent-General and his staff therefore enjoy functional, but notformal, equality with other missions. Sir Girja Bajpai is not formally receivedby the President, but only has access to him on a personal and informal basis.When President Truman agreed to continue this practice, which was initiated by President Roosevelt, the Viceroy thought it would be inadvisable to press, atthat time, for formal equality of status.When the Secretary of State for India announced His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s intention to hold the Simla Conference, he said that, as part of the plan,external affairs would be placed in charge of an Indian member, and &quot; fullyaccredited representatives&quot; of India would be appointed abroad. If Indianrepresentation in Washington were put on a footing of complete equality withthat of the Dominions the change would, it is believed, give considerablesatisfaction in India and would be accepted in the United States as further evidence of the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to grant her full dominion status. Apart, moreover, from Sir G. Bajpai&apos;s own wishes in this matter, itwould free him from the embarrassments attendant upon his present position ofheadship of a foreign mission in the United States without the privileges accorded to recognised diplomatic repi-esentatives.
The matter was taken up with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom in 1944 with the full support of the Viceroy, but the Cabinet did not feel able to make any change at the time.British Embassy, Washington,14th July, 1945.ANNEX IT.Directive to the Minister for India in the United States of America.1.   As Minister for India in the United States of America you will beresponsible for representing the Government of India in all matters affectinginterests common to -the United States and India, and will exercise political and diplomatic control over all Government of India officials and official missions. accredited to the United States.2.
