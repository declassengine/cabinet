Or-. ,JPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 131.28th August, 1945.Copy No.   30CABINET.PRESERVATION OE  CIVILIAN RESPIRATORS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. I have decided to instruct local authorities, with the help of formermembers of the Civil Defence Services and the W.V.S., to collect as many aspossible of the respirators of various types issued to the public (amounting tosome 50 million) and to return them to the Home Office for disposal.2. The process must be gradual, as it depends upon the availability oftransport, labour and storage facilities, but I hope that it will be accomplishedbefore the public have lost patience. As the respirators are collected, they will then be examined and those with faults will be discarded. The remainder will be preserved (together with the unissued reserves of all kinds amounting to approxi-mately 28 million) for their natural life-time or, according to future developments,will be replaced by new manufacture, to keep a stock sufficient for civilianrequirements in the event of this country ever being subject to gas attacks.3. The Chiefs of Staff will no doubt continue their examination of thescale and nature of the Civil Defence organisation which the country will needafter the war, but in November Last they advised that they thought that whenthe war in Europe ended, arrangements should be made for the collection and storage of civilian respirators as a reasonable assurance over the next few years.When the question of collecting respirators was discussed by the War Cabinet(on the 26th February, 1945) they decided no action should be taken at the present stage, but that the matter should be left over for further consideration at theend of the European War. Storage difficulties in connection with other vitalsupplies no doubt weighed with the Cabinet, as they must continue to do.4. I have now had an opportunity of reviewing the position. In my opinionwe cannot do otherwise than to assume in the future planning of civil defence that provision must be made against gas attack. Without an adequate supplyof efficient respirators (and this cannot be improvised in a few weeks or months)we should be at the mercy of an enemy who had recourse to gas warfare againstthe civilian population. Storage space should become available in the Home OfficeStores which contain the unissued reserves, as arrangements are made for thedisposal of other surplus equipment. I cannot suppose that the unoccupied spacecan be put to better use.5. So long as we have an adequate supply of serviceable gas masks theessential provision against gas attack has been made.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,28th August, 1945.[30410]
