(45) 121.I 18th August, 1945.CABINET.THE INDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I have been asked by the India Committee to put forward for theconsideration of the Cabinet a broad outline of how I suggest that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should proceed with the implementation of the proposals for thelong-term solution of the Indian problem contained in the Cripps Offer of 1942;and to prepare the draft of a statement to be made by the Viceroy as regards the holding of elections for the Central and Provincial Legislatures.The Cripps long-term proposals.2.   The Cripps long-term proposals were as follows :-&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore make the following declaration :(a) Immediately upon the cessation of hostilities, steps shall be takento set up in India, in the manner described hereafter, an electedbody charged with the task of framing a new Constitution forIndia.(6) Provision shall be made, as set out below, for the participation ofthe Indian States in the constitution-making body,(c) His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to accept and implement forth-with the Constitution so framed subject only to-(i) the right of any Province of British India that is notprepared to accept the new Constitution to retain itspresent constitutional position, provision being made forits subsequent accession if it so decides.With such non-acceding Provinces, should they so desire, His. Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be prepared to agree upon a new Constitution, giving them the same full status as the Indian Union, and arrived at by a procedure analogous to that here laid down.(ii) the signing of a Treaty which shall be negotiated between his Majesty&apos;s Government and the constitution-makingbody. This Treaty will cover all necessary matters arisingout of the complete transfer of responsibility from Britishto Indian hands; it will make provision, in accordance withthe undertakings given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, forthe protection of racial and religious minorities; but willnot impose any restriction on the power of the IndianUnion to decide in the future its relationship to the other member States of the British Commonwealth.Whether or not an Indian State elects to adhere to the Constitution, itwill be necessary to negotiate a revision of its treaty arrangements, sofar as this may be required in the new situation.[30380] b
(d) The constitution-making body shall be composed as follows, unlessthe leaders of Indian opinion in the principal communities agree upon some other form before the end of hostilities : Immediately upon the result being known of the provincialelections which will be necessary at the end of hostilities, theentire membership of. the Lower Houses of the Provinciali Legislatures, shall,,,as a ;single,^electoral college, proceed to theelection of the constitution-making body by the system of propor-,. tional representation. This new body shall be in number about one-tenth of the number of the electoral college.Indian States shall be invited to appoint representatives mthe same proportion to their total population as in the case ofthe representatives of British India as a whole, and with thesame powers as the British Indian members.&quot;Objections of main parties.3.   It was not on these proposals that the negotiations in fact foundered, butobjection was taken to them by Congress -on the grounds principally that- (a) they were &apos;&apos; a severe blow to the conception of Indian unity,&apos;&apos; and(6) they ignored the peoples of the Indian States &quot;a negation both of democracy and self-determination&quot; in that &quot;while the representa-tion of an Indian State in the constitution-making body is fixed on a population basis, the people of an Indian State would have no voice in choosing their representatives.&quot;4. The Muslim League were not satisfied with the proposed composition ofthe constitution-making body and demanded the right to elect their ownrepresentatives through separate electorates; and they objected to the right ofnon-accession being given to the existing provinces &quot; which have been formed from time to time for administrative convenience and on no logical basis.&quot;Further, they took exception to the suggestion of Sir Stafford Cripps, separatelymade (Annexure I), that the determining majority in the provincial legislativeassemblies in favour of an Indian Union should be 60 per cent, and that a minorityshould have the right to demand a plebiscite of the adult male population. -Theyasserted that as Muslims were under-represented in the provinces with a Muslimmajority population this procedure would be no true criterion of real Muslimopinion in those provinces; moreover, a plebiscite of the whole male population(and not of Muslim males only) denied them the inherent right to self-determination. --5. The actual break-down, of course, occurred on the proposals for theimmediate re-constitution of the Central Executive, and it is therefore impossibleto say whether the objections of Congress and the League to the long-term proposals would have been maintained.6. The present Viceroy has since put the long-term problem into the background and concentrated his efforts on bringing the leaders of the parties together in the hope that, by persuading them to participate in the responsibilities of the Central Government, the long-term problems might be rendered easier to solve.7. The Viceroy&apos;s attempt having failed, I propose that the Cabinet should now proceed to implement the long-term proposals in the Cripps Declaration.The Provincial elections ^which the Viceroy and the Governors (except theGovernor of the Punjab) desire in any case to hold as soon as possible can be Icompleted early next year. It would be in accordance with paragraph (a) ofthe 1942 Declaration that the next step should be to set up a constitution-makingbody.At this stage I am not dealing with the question which would arise under!paragraph (c) (i) of the Declaration, namely, the method whereby the wishes!of a Province in regard to the exercise of the right to stand out of the new!Constitution, when made, should be ascertained. This question requires further;consideration.Mr. Rajagopalachariar&apos;s Alternative.8. The Declaration provides for the entire membership of the Lower Houses?of the Provincial Legislatures (1,585 persons) formed as a result of elections!proceeding immediately as a single electoral college to elect by proportional
356representation a constitution-making body, &quot; unless the leaders of Indian opinion in the principal communities agree upon some other form before the end ofhostilities.&quot; Up to the present date no such agreement has been reached, butan alternative method has been suggested in a recent statement byMr. Rajagopalachariar (Annexure II), ex-Congress Premier of Madras, who,ever since the Cripps Declaration, has made repeated attempts to secure agreement between Congress and the Muslim League to implement His Majestj^governments proposals. Mr.- Rajagop&apos;alabhariar&apos;s suggestion is that eachnewly elected Provincial Assembly should first put to the vote the questionwhether there should be an Indian Union and that the Provinces which decidedfor the Union should send delegates elected by proportional representation toform the constitution-making- body. By this means that body would meet witha mandate to create an Indian Union and no other constitution. This appearsto be the main advantage of the proposal; but it would cause the Pakistan issue to be decided in Provinces with a Muslim majority before this had been discussed in the probably less tense atmosphere of a constitution-making body. Moreover,such Provinces as opted against the Indian Union would go unrepresented in the body which made the constitution and so would have no part in determiningsafeguards for Muslims within the Union. It is therefore difficult to believe thatMr. Rajagopalachariar&apos;s formula would overcome previous Muslim objectionsto the Cripps proposals ; whereas it would precipitate the issue of &quot; vivisection &quot;of India to the possible extent of at least four provinces. For this reason Iwould prefer to adhere to the proposals in the Cripps Declaration whereby thequestion of contracting out of an Indian Union would not be taken in theprovincial legislatures until they had before them the results of the work of theconstitution-making body.The Moslem League adopted a Resolution in 1942 demanding as a variant ofthe proposed system of election by proportional representation that Muslimrepresentation in the constitution-making body should be secured by separateMuslim electorates. I would deprecate this extended application of the system of separate.communal electorates.Representation of the States.9. As regards the representation of the States it was assumed by my predecessor that Rulers should nominate representatives. To this procedure there seems no constitutional alternative since the Rulers constitute the only authority with which the Crown is in relationship, and to the extent that democratic government does not exist in the States it is impossible to insist on democratically-elected representatives. But the possibility of asking the Rulers to use means,whether through existing electoral bodies or otherwise, of ascertaining their people&apos;s choice of representatives merits examination and might be put to theViceroy. Under the Cripps proposal the States would be entitled to appoint representatives in the same proportion to their total population as in the caseof the representatives of British India. The Provinces of British India were tobe represented in the constitution-making body by about one-tenth of the totalnumber of members of their Assemblies (1,585), say 158. These would representa total population of some 289 millions in the eleven Governors&apos; Provinces. Thetotal population in the States being 98 millions, they could accordingly claimabout 50 seats in the constitution-making body. If certain Provinces shouldabstain from participation in the proceedings of that body, the resultingreduction in the number of Provincial representatives would presumably entail a corresponding reduction of the States&apos; representatives. On the method ofapportioning representation among the States I should in any case have to consult the Viceroy. A rough guide might be afforded by the representation accorded toStates under the Government of India Act in the Federal Legislative assembly in which they would have 125 seats.Recommendations.10.   My recommendations, therefore, are : (i) that Elections, Provincial and Central, shall be held at the earliestpossible date, subject to the proviso that the Central Elections willhave to precede Provincial Elections, in order to be completed by theend of the year so that the new Assembly may be in being for theBudget Session beginning early in 1946;(ii) that the Viceroy should be invited to state, when announcing the decisionto hold elections, that the Provincial Assemblies to be elected will,[30380] B 2
in addition to fulfilling their normal functions, be charged as a singleelectoral college with the responsibility of choosing representatives who, with representatives of the Indian States, would form a con-stitution-making body to lay the foundations of self-government forIndia as was envisaged in the offer made by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin 1942.11. I suggest the following statement for issue by the Viceroy, subject to hisconcurrence in its terms :  Draft Statement.Now that Japan has been forced by the United Nations to surrender andhostilities have come to an end, I have been in consultation with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the question what further measures should be taken to implement their Declaration of March 1942, to the main principles of which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment stand pledged in their entirety. In that Declaration they declaredthat immediately upon the cessation of hostilities steps should be taken to set upin India an elected body charged with the task of framing a new constitution for India.The first of these steps was declared to be the holding of Provincial elections and in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government I have requested the Governorsto arrange for these elections to be held at the earliest date practicable in thedifferent conditions obtaining in each Province.These elections will be preceded by those for the Central Assembly which arelong overdue : the latter will be completed in time to establish a new Assemblyfor the Budget Session 1946.The Provincial Assemblies to be elected will, in addition to fulfilling their normal functions, be charged as a single electoral college with the responsibility ofchoosing representatives who,- with representatives of the Indian States, would form the constitution-making body envisaged in the Declaration. &apos;&apos; P. L.India Office,18th August, 1945.ANNEXURE I.Letter from Sir Stafford Cripps&apos; Secretary to Mr. M. A. Jinnahdated 2nd April, 1942.You said on the telephone this morning that Press reports did not give a clear picture of the method by which it was proposed that a Province should decide to opt out of an Indian Union set up in accordance with the procedurelaid down in His Majesty&apos;s Governments draft declaration. In reply I amdesired to say that the proposition which Sir Stafford Cripps put orally toyourself and the other leaders is that a Province should refeh its decisionAvhether or not to stand out of the Union by a vote in the Legislative assembly on a resolution to stand in. If the majority for accession to the Union is lessthan 60 per cent., the minority would have the right to demand a plebiscite ofthe adult male population.Sir Stafford has received no objections to this proposition from any quarter,but he does not propose that it should be formally announced in writing atpresent. If another method of achieving the same result was to be agreed tolater between the leaders of Indian opinion, it could be substituted for his own,provided that it would achieve what is essential, namely, to procure a genuineimpression of the wishes of the majority of the Provincial population, and provided also that it was administratively practicable.
ANNEXURE II.Extract from Statement on 5th August, 1945, by Mr. Rajagopalachariar.As regards a permanent solution, Mr. Rajagopalachariar presumes that theLabour Government will follow the plan adumbrated in the 1942 Declaration,and suggests that the time-table and procedure should be modified as follows : &apos;&apos; Let Provincial elections be held on any early date. Then let eachProvincial Assembly vote on the issue of forming a Union. We may be sure thatat least seven Provinces will vote for forming an Indian Union. All Provincesvoting in this manner should proceed with the election of members to theConstitution-making body by the method of proportional representation, and the body so formed should proceed to frame the Constitution for a union. We will thus have a homogeneous Constituent Assembly framing a Constitution for an,Indian Union. Those who vote for remaining outside would continue under thepresent Constitution until they gained strength and unity among themselves to frame a separate Union and a separate Constitution. It would be open to suchProvinces to revise their attitude at any time later and vote for joining the mainIndian Union.This modification of the time-table would result in several advantages. Theproceedings of the Constitution-making body would be marked by speed andco-ordinated intention. The Provinces would think several times before votingto remain out. It would enable a thoroughly satisfactory Constitution to be framed in the first instance. . The other plan would lead to a series of checks andbalances being proposed, which would weaken the Centre most certainly, and yet the object of it all would probably remain unrealised, namely, the accession of the Muslim League Provinces. The plan I propose would have an advantage over the time-table contained in the 1942 Declaration.In view of the repeated declarations of the Muslim League, the BritishGovernment should consider whether the original time-table should not be modified as I have proposed. The Provinces that vote for League leadershipwould be compelled to make their choice with positive obligations, instead ofmerely acting as a brake.&quot;ANNEXURE III.Provincial Legislative Assemblies.Total Muhammad an. &apos; Seats.
