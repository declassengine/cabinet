SECRET.CP. (45) 145.4th September, 1945.MEMORIAL TO PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.THERE is outstanding a proposal to provide a memorial in London to president Roosevelt.2. Various suggestions have been made and one which found favour withthe United States Embassy, when the matter was discussed semi-officially withthem, provided for a memorial Tablet in Westminster Abbey to be erected bythe Government and an appeal to the public to subscribe funds for the continua-tion of the Churchill Club, possibly under the name of the Churchill-RooseveltClub. This club, started by private subscription in 1943 to provide clubamenities and cultural entertainment for members of the American, Dominionsand Home Forces, and other students, has been very successful, and thepossibility of continuing it after the war on a somewhat different basis is, Iunderstand, being considered by its organisers. Mr. Churchill, however, didnot approve of the Tablet proposal and considered that the memorial should takethe shape of a statue to be erected in the Canning Enclosure, Parliament Square,where President Lincoln now stands.3. It would not fall to me to make out a case for a cultural institute and Ipropose in this paper to confine myself to the statue project. The finding of asuitable site will present some difficulty. There are already a number ofstatues in Parliament Square and Sir Reginald Blomfield, who carried out in1919 a survey of sites for statues reported that &quot; Parliament Square containssome of the worst statues and pedestals in London. It is already too crowdedand it is doubtful whether it is desirable to place any more memorials thereat all.&quot; Since then, a statue to Lincoln has been erected in the CanningEnclosure, but the purchase in 1935 of adjacent land by the Middlesex CountyCouncil will make it possible to erect another statue without unduly over-crowding this site. A scheme has been provisionally worked out which providesfor the removal of Canning to a new position facing the Great George StreetGovernment Offices&apos; and places President Roosevelt in the middle of theEnclosure opposite the Houses of Parliament. The cost of such a scheme isestimated roughly at  23,000. of which the statue would cost about  12,000.The advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission has not jet been obtainedofficially.4. It is not clear to me why Parliament Square should be considered themost appropriate site. There may have been valid reasons for putting AbrahamLincoln close to the Abbey, but I do not think that these necessarily involve the placing in Parliament Square of more statues of American statesmen howevereminent. Moreover, we cannot ignore the possibility that proposals may bemade to commemorate other great foreign statesmen and service leaders, inwhich event there might be a somewhat embarrassing competition for the limitedspace available.5. An alternative and better site for the statue, in my opinion, would beGrosvenor Square, where the Duke of Westminster has kindly agreed to make available a site, subject to his approval being obtained to the layout and[30461]** PCopy No.    t) cabinet.&quot;   198Printed for the Cabinet.

design. The square has long been associated with the United States. TheAmerican Embassy is here and the district was largely taken over during thewar by American establishments. A site here would thus be very appropriate and the square would certainly give scope for a fine scheme.6. I shall be glad to have the views of my colleagues on this matter. Ifthey decide in favour of a statue, I suggest that the views of the Royal FineArt Commission should be obtained on the suitability of Grosvenor Square.G. T.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,&amp;h September, 1945.
