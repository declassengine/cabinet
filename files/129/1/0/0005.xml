\ I c/IP  1413 B0GUIC3NT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (45)1 051 OTH AUGUST,. 1 9h5.THE CANCELLATION OP EAR ORDERS   .Memorandum by the Minister of Supply and Aircraft- .     ^poduo^tion1.      In view of the turn of events, it is essential&apos; that immediatedecisions should he taken about the cancellation of war orders &quot;by theSupply Departments..     So far as the Ministry of Supply is concerned,the future requirements after the cessation of hostilities with japan are dependent upon an assessment &quot;by the Service Departments oftheir requirements to maintain the Armies of Occupation in europe and in the Par East,  and to make reasonable provision for there-equipment and maintenance of whatever forces are to he maintained in peace.      It is obvious that no such reassessment of requirementscan he made rapidly &quot;by the Service Departments..     On the other hand,it is considered possible for the Supply Departments, in consulta-tion   with the Service Departments to make immediately a &quot;broadassessment of those articles in the present production programmes which are definitely no longer required or can he substantially reduced,1&apos;      &apos; .-2.    - Continuation of any war &quot;production which is not necessary wouldhe an economic waste Ohjectionable from every point of view.      Itwould in any case involve the misuse of materials, most of which arein short supply and urgently required for civil needs.      It would,moreover,  involve the use of labour in the manufacture of storeswhich, in most cases, would have later to he broken down.      looking at the matter from a different point of view, continued war produc-tion   now is probably in the main an aggravation of the disposalsproblem and delays the switch over of production to pedcetime^^^^requirement.      It is surely wrong to continue to fill S^Tozxvoswith ojfiffl&amp;ntiffifroB. merely to break it down again with all the risk tolife involved at every stage.The Ministry of Supply would propose to put an end as quickly as possible to all production which is no. longer required for the continuing needs of the Services as indicated above.      In view of the news already broadcast it is desirable that contractors  and factories should have early intimation of this intention,  and as faras practicable notifications should be sent to them on Monday,13th or Tuesday, Ihth August giving either definite cancellation of contracts or - advance warning of probable cancellations in thenear future.3.      Every effort will be made to supply the Ministry of Labourand the Board of Trade with details of the major contractcancellations.      It should be realised that there can be nochoice in the process of contract cancellation at this stage,  andit will not therefore, be possible to avoid causing employmentdifficulties in certain districts.
