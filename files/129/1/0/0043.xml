Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.&apos;CP. (45) 143.4th September, 1945.CABINET.CELEBRATION OF ARMISTICE DAY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department.UNTIL 1939 it was customary for Armistice Day, the 11th November, to becelebrated by the holding of a special service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall at11 a.m., and of local services at that hour generally throughout the country.When Armistice Day did not fall on a Sunday, the Sunday immediately followingArmistice Day was generally observed as Remembrance Sunday. The11th November, except when it fell on a Sunday, was the day on which poppieswere sold for the funds of the British Legion. During the war the holding of services at 11 a.m. on the morning of the 11th November was abandoned becauseof the importance of avoiding the congregation of crowds, in pursuance of theGovernments policy of dispersal with a view to minimising the possibility of casulties in air raids.2. The question now arises whether on Sunday, the 11th November next, weshall revert to the pre-war practice of a ceremony at the Cenotaph attended byThe King, Members of the Royal Family, the Cabinet, the High commissioners and the heads of the Fighting Services. I think it would be the general wish once again publicly.to observe the two minutes&apos; silence, and to have it associated withservices of remembrance. I would propose, therefore, if my colleagues agree, totake The King&apos;s Pleasure as to the revival of the ceremony at the Cenotaph on the11th November, 1945.3. Shortly after VE-day, the Lord President, as Home Secretary, receiveda deputation, led by the Bishop of Winchester, representing the Church ofEngland, and including representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, the FreeChurch Federal Council and the British Legion. The deputation raised thequestion of the future of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday after the war.4. The deputation expressed the view that it was undesirable that thereshould be more than one Remembrance Day after the end of the war, and they suggested the desirability of adopting one day as Remembrance Day in com-memoration of two national deliverances and of the fallen in both of the wars.The 11th November and the Sunday following it are already well established inthe&apos; United Kingdom and to a large extent throughout the Commonwealth and empire; and the British Legion have a special interest in the observance of armistice Day. The objections to the adoption of the 11th November as Remem-brance Day for both wars are the uncertainty of the weather at this time of theyear and the fact that the November Sunday tends to collide with Civic Sunday,which follows the election of new Mayors. Furthermore, it was represented that unless the end of the Japanese war took place in November, it would beunreal to remember on the 11th November (a day hitherto associated with the defeat of Germany in 1918) the much greater and more widespread sacrifices made during the present war.5. The deputation accordingly suggested the observance in England of aSaturday/Sunday in the summer as a National Day of Remembrance, Thanks-giving and Dedication. They assumed that general parades, meetings anddemonstrations would take place on the Saturday, and the Sunday would be a day for special religious services, and further, that so far as England is concerned at any rate, this week-end would be at least as closely associated with the workof the British Legion as the November ceremonies have been. They felt thatthe National Day should be one which Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, atany rate, should also observe, and that it should be associated in some real and definite way with an historic event in connection with the war and of significanceto all in Great Britain.[30438]Copy No,   *5 0
6. The British Legion were strongly in favour of the adoption of oneNational Day as a Day of Remembrance in respect of both wars and of themaintenance of the Cenotaph as the National memorial for both wars. Theywere very anxious in particular that the Two Minutes&apos; Silence ceremonial shouldbe resumed.7. The Lord President told the deputation that he favoured one NationalDay of Remembrance associated with a national service of remembrance at theCenotaph. He would like to see the day linked with some real historic event,following the precedent of the 11th November. That might be either VE-day orVJ-day. The matter was, however, one for the Cabinet to decide, and they werenot likely to take a decision before the end of hostilities. Nevertheless, until anew National Day had been fixed he thought the observance of the 11th Novembershould continue.8. The Bishop of Winchester suggested that at some time nearer Novembera public statement should be made that for this year at any rate, the 11th Novemberwould be celebrated&apos; as Armistice Day, pending the choice of a new NationalDay.9. What should the new day be? Should it always be a Sunday? Thereare two obvious alternatives VE-day, 8th May or VJ-day, 15th August. on grounds of weather there is probably nothing to choose between these two dates.The appointment of the 8th May might prove embarrassing so far as the Churchcalendar is concerned, in connection with Ascension Day and Whitsuntide. Underthe present arrangements for fixing the date for Easter, Ascension Day will not fall on the 8th May until 1975. The Sunday after the 8th May might, however,conflict with the growing observance of an early Sunday in May as Farm orRogation Sunday.10. There are no similar difficulties about the 15th August, but that datefalls during the holiday period when normally the House is in recess and ministers are away from London. The 15th August does mark the definite end of the warand in consequence may be preferred to the 8th May. It also has a specialsignificance for the United States of America and it may be desirable to endeavourto arrange a day which the United States of America would also be willing to observe as Remembrance Day.11. On the other hand, it is, in my view, desirable to select a date betweenthe middle of June and July before the holiday season has set in. Magna CartaDay, the 15th June, would probably be as good a choice as any on which to com-memorate our victory in the struggle for freedom. Such a date would havethe advantage that it would not conflict with Whitsun (which can fall at lateston the 13th June) at all during the present century, even if the Sunday nearest tothe 15th June were the day of observance, since Whitsun will not fall on or after the 11th June before the year 2000.12. In connection with Remembrance Day it must be borne in mind thatparades of British Legion branches, Old Contemptibles, &amp;c, can be satisfactorilyarranged only on a Sunday. I would like to suggest for the consideration ofmy colleagues that I should explore, with all the interested parties, the adoptionof some day in June which would be observed as Remembrance Day if it fell ona Sunday, or the next following Sunday if it did not so fall.13.   I recommend that &apos;(1) There should not be separate days of remembrance for the two wars.(2) It would not be appropriate to appoint the 11th November as the Dayof Remembrance for both wars.(3) Should The King approve the holding of the Armistice Day Service on .the 11th November next, the preliminary announcement should makeit clear that although Armistice Day will be celebrated on the usuallines this year as a Day of Remembrance for those who have fallen in both wars, in the near future some other date will be fixed as aNational Day of Remembrance on which those who had fallen inthe two wars would be honoured and remembered.(4) I should examine with representatives of the Churches, of the british legion, and of other interested parties, the question of settling aNational Day of Remembrance for 1946 and future years.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,Uh September, 1945.
