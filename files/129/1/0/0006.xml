THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   Auqust 1945.        /-!-4-.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 106.12th August, 1945.CABINET.CONTINUANCE OF CENSORSHIP IN THE PERIOD immediately following THE CEASE-FIRE.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.FOLLOWING the Japanese offer of Surrender the Chief Press Censor hasreceived suggestions from some representatives of the Press that the continuanceof censorship now serves no useful purpose. His reply has been that, so far as heis aware, censoring must in any event continue until the Japanese military forcescease to be in a position to take offensive action in any part of the world.2. I doubt whether it would be possible for the Chief Press Censor to securethe compliance of the Press with this policy once the end of the war has been declared, unless it can be communicated to them as a formal decision of theGovernment. So long as Defence Regulation 3 remains uncancelled our powersof censorship remain theoretically intact; in practice, however, the Press wouldbe unlikely to submit material for censorship if they felt sure that its publicationwas not &quot; likely to prejudice the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war.&apos;&apos;3. It will be recalled that press censorship of material affecting germany was continued until all possibility of offensive action by German submarines orother naval forces had ceased. In effect this meant the continuance of censorshiprelating to the war with Germany until about three weeks after VE-day. i therefore recommend that the Cabinet should authorise me to inform the press that censorship will continue to operate until such time as the Japanese militaryforces have carried out the Armistice conditions laid down by the Allies.E. J. W.Ministry of Information, W.C. 1,12th August, 1945.[30335]
