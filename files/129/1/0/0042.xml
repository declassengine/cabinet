Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 142.1st September. 1945.CABINET.THE   GOVERNMENT   PLAN   FOR   ENCOURAGING   industrial organisation AND EFFICIENCY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.(The Lord President^ Committee, at their meeting on the 31st August, 1945,considered my memorandum L.P. (45) 152, and agreed that, with certain amend-ments, the proposals contained in that paper should be submitted to the Cabinet.The memorandum I now submit is based on L.P. (45) 152, but takes account ofthe points raised by my colleagues.)1. The Board of Trade, during the tenure of office of this Government, willbe concerned with the whole field of industry except the engineering industry andsuch other industries as are already the concern of other Government Depart-ments. Thus it will not be concerned with industries for which we havenationalisation plans, but it will be operating over a wide field of privateenterprise.2. Our general financial and economic position is such that a high degree ofindustrial efficiency (using the word &quot; efficiency &quot; in its broadest sense) is a national interest of the first importance. It will therefore be the business of the Govern-ment, and especially of the Board of Trade, to play a positive part in securing thatBritish industry operated under private enterprise quickly reaches, and thereaftermaintains, full efficiency.3. I should like to suggest to my colleagues the broad outlines of a plan forthis purpose. I can best describe the plan by describing in general terms what 1should myself propose to do immediately in relation to a number of selectedindustries. The industries which I have provisionally selected as being highly important from the point of view of consumer needs, several of them having, atthe same time, important export significance, are these pottery, wool, boots andshoes, hosiery, furniture.4. I propose that an investigation should be conducted into each of these industries, with the primary object of ascertaining and agreeing with both sides of the industry what the industry needs in order to make it as efficient as possiblein the national interest. Such investigation should be conducted by a committee consisting, as to one third, of employers&apos; representatives, as to one third of trade unionists, and, as to one third, of persons appointed by myself, including an impartial chairman of high standing. The Committee should be kept as small aspossible consistent with the representation of the interests concerned I cite atypical composition of a Committee of twelve : 4 Employers&apos; representatives.4 Trade Unionists.1 Economist.1 Engineer.1 Scientist or Designer.1 Chairman.The independent representatives appointed by myself would watch the consumer&apos;interests as well as be useful in the particular technical field in which they were[30439]Copy No.
experienced. This.is. only a suggested possible composition, as obviously withinthe one-third apportionment the type of individuals chosen must vary with different industries.5. The Committee would not themselves go into matters of detail, for whichpurpose they could set up technical sub-committees with members co-opted&quot; bythe Chairman. I should expect them to report quickly at least by way of interimreport.6. It will be for the Board of Trade, on receiving any report, itself to workout a scheme taking account of the proposals in the report and then to take such steps as are best calculated to get that scheme into operation.7. We should avoid the impression that we wish to impose upon the industry a. pre-conceived Government plan. On the contrary, both sides of industry should feel that what the Government is trying to do .is to help the industry to helpitself. That is not to say, however, that if agreed proposals were not forthcoming,or if the proposals were unsatisfactory, the Government should be content to restinactive.8. I have discussed this plan, with particular reference to the committees of Investigation with Sir Walter Citrine for the T.U.C. and Sir Clive Baillieufor the F.B.I. Both Sir Walter Citrine and Sir Clive Baillieu are in agreementwith what I propose. I have also-since questions of wages and conditions will obviously arise discussed the matter with the Chairman of the Employers&apos;Confederation, who had no objections.9. Once the initial plan has been put into operation, I should propose then to establish in each industry a permanent advisory body which would be thechannel through which the Government would keep in touch with the progress ofthe efficiency plan. It.would equally serve as the channel for further recommen-dations to the Government from the industry. This body would be purelyadvisory, and would have no powers of compulsion. If, in an extreme case, com-pulsion turned out to be necessary a matter as to which the Government wouldhave to be the sole judges it would be for the Government to exercise such powers.An advisory body of this kind should, I think, have the same sort of compositionas the original Committee of Investigation. I shall, however, be putting forwardmore definite proposals on this at a later date.10. If my colleagues agree, I should propose to proceed at once with the setting up of Committees of Inquiry in the five industries I have named.11. Cotton is a special case. As my colleagues know, I have already secured the agreement of both sides of the cotton industry to the appointment of aCommission to frame proposals for revising wage arrangements, and reformingthe staffing of machines. I think it is also necessary to set up, for the CottonIndustry, a Committee of Investigation of the same kind as that which I havesuggested above. I should propose to pursue this suggestion, when I resumediscussions with the cotton industry on the 8th September. Since there are so many sections inside the cotton industry it may be necessary to have a larger body to conduct the inquiry, so that all sections of the industry may be represented. Itwill be necessary to determine the relationship of this Commission, and of any permanent advisory body set up thereafter for the cotton industry, to the CottonBoard and the Cotton Control. This question is being further investigated andI need not trouble my colleagues with it.R. S. C.Board of Trade, S.W.1.1st September, 1945.
