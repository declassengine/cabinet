THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMBNTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET,C.P. (45) 108,11th August, 1945.CABINET.RUSSIAN APPLICATION FOR ASSISTANCE FROM U.N.R.R.A.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THE present session of the Council of the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation Administration is raising some difficult issues on which I mayhave to ask for guidance urgently. Meanwhile I think the Cabinet should be aware of the position arising over the Russian request to U.N.R.R.A. forassistance, since political issues of great importance may be involved.2. A very short time before the Council session began the Russiansformally asked U.N.R.R.A. for free supplies up to a value of $700 million. this request (news of which has been published) is being very energetically followed up by the Russians, who will certainly attempt to hold up other business at theCouncil until they receive some assurance that their request is being favourablyacted upon. In particular the Russians may be expected to oppose, or at any rateobstruct and delay, any extension of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s responsibilities in Italy, whichis of great importance to us, until they have obtained satisfaction.3. The Russian request to U.N.R.R.A. is clearly part of a general Russianattempt to obtain financial assistance from the western democracies. One of theSoviet Delegation has, indeed, explained that, had the U.S.S.R. been more successful in obtaining credits from the United States and the United Kingdom,the request to U.N.R.R.A. would probably not have been made. In other words,having failed to obtain sufficiently favourable credit terms, they are now trying to do even better by getting supplies free. Moreover, although the Russians havespecified the commodities they require from U.N.R.R.A., they have allowed it tobe known that, if they do not get these commodities, they can take the assistancefrom U.N.R.R.A. in other forms. They have also explained that their total relief and reconstruction import requirements will cost $7,000 million, so that theyare only asking U.N.R.R.A. for 10 per cent of the total.4. On the score of their sacrifices in the common cause and of the magnitude of the war damage done in Russia there is a strong case for helping Russia. Onthe other hand, it is a fundamental principle of U.N.R.R.A. that its assistance is given only to those countries which are not able to pay for their imports inforeign exchange. There is a procedure laid down for an examination of thefinancial position of applicants. It is clear that the Russians do not propose fceproduce any worthwhile information about their financial position for any suchexamination and will seek to justify their request on the ground that they areasking U.N.R.R.A. for only a small proportion of their needs, that China isasking for even more, and that in any case they deserve it.5. The general position of U.N.R.R.A. finances is such that a further contribution will in any case be required if U.N.R.R.A. is to finish its job in thecountries where it is at present operating and to take on Italy and Austria. Ifthe Russian request were met the new money required would be more than theadditional 1 per cent, of national income which is the most that any contributingcountry is willing to contemplate. 06.   We have, of course, discussed the position with the Americans.   their financial stake in U.N.R.R A. is over four times ours, and they are in a position12877   [30337]/Copy No.
to provide credits outside U.N.R.R.A. on a scale and on terms whichwe couldnot contemplate. The Americans&apos; first reaction was that the Russians mustbe made to submit their case to examination in the normal way, and that, if theinformation supplied was inadequate, the Russians should be told that theycould not be found by the Committee to be unable to- pay for their require-in ents: They also seemed to think that if the Russians were to be beneficiaries itwould prove most difficult to get any further money from Congress. It is evident, however, that if the Russian request were refused there would be therisk of a serious breach with the Russians, and it is not&apos; impossible that the americans may finally propose some kind of compromise which might takethe form of offering the Russians some portion of what they have demanded from u.N.R.R.A. funds, and some credit arrangements for the balance, or for part of it.7. It seems to me that on this matter we must follow the American lead. Ifthey decide to stand firm we shall have to support them. If, on the other hand,they propose a compromise, I think we shall agree provided that the rest of u.N.R.R.A.&apos;s work is not prejudiced therebyP. J. N.-B.Foreign Office, 11th August, 1945.
