At a meeting to-day, which was attended by the Service Ministerstogether with those Ministers whose Departments are mainly interested in therelease of men and women to civil employment, the Man-Power committee considered and approved the annexed memorandum by the Service departments and the Ministry of Labour and National Service. It will be observed that thememorandum proposes (in paragraphs 4 to 8) certain modifications designed to speed up releases in Class B, but that, so far as Class A is concerned, it is not felt that definite proposals can be put forward until information is available as to the Forces required to meet our military commitments following on the freshappreciation which is being made by the Chiefs of Staff.3. The Man-Power Committee also agreed that the Minister of Labourand National Service should make a statement to the Press in the terms of thatappended to the Annex to this memorandum. It will be noted that paragraph 13of the memorandum by the Service Departments and the Ministry of Laboursuggests for consideration whether the statement should include an estimate ofthe position which it is hoped to reach by June 1946, which on present information would enable a total of over 2^ million to be released from the Forces. The Man-Power Committee were of opinion that in view of the revised figures whichshould be available shortly on the basis of the fresh appreciation by the Chiefsof Staff it would not be desirable to give the figure of 2\ million.5. The Man-Power Committee propose to keep under constant review thepossibility of making modifications within the general principles of the demobilisation scheme designed to speed up releases. In particular, they intend to consider the possibility of a further revision of the conditions of release in class B. They also propose that steps should be taken to increase the intake ofmen under 30 into the Forces by adopting a stricter policy with regard to defer-ments. This should enable releases under Class A to be increased and should do away with an existing sense of grievance in the Forces.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1945.[30441]b
ANNEX.Memorandum by the Service Departments and the Ministry of Labour.AT their meeting on the 30th August (CM. (45) 26th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet invited the Man-Power Committee to submit an early report on thequestion whether any modifications could be made in the demobilisation schemewhich would accelerate releases in Class A and increase the number of workersreleased in Class B. The Cabinet also agreed that any future public announce-ments about the demobilisation scheme should be made by the Minister of Labourand National Service; and that, in particular, the Minister of Labour and national Service should hold a Press Conference in the following week in orderto explain any decisions which the Cabinet might reach with regard to modifica-tions of the scheme.2. Rate of release under present arrangements. The following table shows the rate of release of men and women up to the end of 1945 under the present arrangements, which are based on decisions of the Defence Committee. TheChiefs of Staff are now making a fresh appreciation of the Forces required tomeet our military commitments throughout the world in the new situation created by the surrender of Japan; and it is essential that pending the results of this review nothing should be done which will impair our ability to discharge these commitments : Monthly Cumulativetotals. totals.June...............        41,000 41,000July...............        97,000 138,000August*      ............      180,000 318,000September^............      124,000 442,000October^     ...      .........      240,000 682,000November^   ............      218,000 900,000December^............      200,000 1,100,0003. Speed-up of release in Class A..-.While we consider that the aim shouldbe the greatest possible acceleration of release in Class A, as providing the best solution to the whole problem, it is not possible to make any definite proposals inthis direction until after the review of the Chiefs of Staff has been completed and decisions taken upon it. An important factor which will in any event be present for some time in connection with speeding up release is shortage of transport.While this shortage persists and it is aggravated by the present position in theFar East the general rate of release will be limited if, as we consider essential,men in the same age-groups are to be released in their turn wherever they maybe serving. A pledge that this would be done as far as possible was given in theWhite Paper (Cmd. 6548) and has been repeated by the Service Departments.4. Speed-up of release in Class B. -We consider that, without departing from the principles of the release scheme, there might well bean increase in the rateof release in Class B. It has already been agreed that, although Class B releasesshall continue to be limited to 10 per cent, of the total releases in Class A, it isnot necessary to adhere to this percentage month by month, and steps are beingtaken to release men in Class B as rapidly as possible subject to the 10 per cent,limit as applied to the first million releases in Class A.5. In view of the seeming reluctance of the Forces to accept release in class B, however, we consider that the conditions of release in this category should now be made more attractive. The present conditions were decided in preparing;for a re-allocation of man-power in the interim period between the defeat ofGermany and the defeat of Japan, and it was then necessary to make a very clear distinction between the benefits attached to release in Class A and Class B when,by accepting the latter, men might escape fighting in the Far East. The distinc-tion was also necessary to maintain the principle that men released out of their turn should not receive the same benefits as those who awaited their proper turnby age and service group.   In the present circumstances the need for this severe* These are estimates and do not take into account discharges on medical and other grounds or releases on compassionate grounds.
distinction does not exist, and we therefore suggest that a man released underClass B should receive the following- benefits : (a) 21 days&apos; leave with pay and allowances.   (Note : This actual leave shouldnot be increased since to do so would be contrary to the intentions of class B release which is to get men back to urgent reconstruction work with the minimum of delay);(b) Pay and allowances in respect of any overseas leave which he may have earned.(c) Payment of war gratuity and post-war credit at the expiration of his paidleave, instead of deferring these payments until the end of theemergency.6. If agreed to this decision should be made retrospective to all Class b releases.7. Under this proposal the differences between Class A and Class B benefits would be that the latter would only receive 21 days&apos; actual leave, and would continue to be directable while the former would not.8. We further suggest that release in Class B should be offered to formerbuilding trade workers serving in this country irrespective of their age and service groups instead of taking the age and service groups in strict rotation.This would result in increasing the total number of building trade workersreleased in Class B beyond the present allocation, but the increase could be set offagainst any future allocation. The advantage would be that the labour force ofthe building trade would be more rapidly reinforced without causing any additional strain on transport from overseas or retarding the release from overseasof men in Class A.9. As regards the release of individual specialists, although they, like othermen released in Class B, will be released as rapidly as possible, we do not recom-mend any relaxation of the standards laid down, as these releases are the mostsuspect in the eyes of the Forces and any relaxation would lead towards the abusesexperienced after the last war. They should, however, receive the revised Class Bbenefits if these are agreed to.10. Redundant personnel.--&apos;^&quot;e have considered whether men and womenserving in this country who are not at present usefully employed could be releasedout of turn without seriously undermining the release scheme. It is not correctto assume that all such persons are merely awaiting demobilisation although they themselves and the public may regard them as being in this position. It is inevit-able that, during the period of readjustment following the unexpected ending ofthe Japanese war, there will be unemployment in the Forces as in industry. UntiLthe establishments overseas and at home are determined following the Govern-ment&apos;s decision on the review by the Chiefs of Staff, it is not possible to identifyor determine the numbers of redundant personnel. Certain measures, however,are already being taken : (a) Reposting is proceeding as expeditiously as possible in the presentcircumstances.(b) Men and women in low medical categories who cannot be employed arebeing discharged.(c) To a limited extent, personnel who cannot be profitably reposted are being-discharged under the Redundancy Procedure.(d) In the R.A.F. and the Navy the system of unequal release by ranks andtrades enables redundancy to be eliminated to a considerable extent.11. While fully aware of the pressure from certain quarters that thereshould be wholesale premature release of those apparently redundant, we arefirmly of the opinion that it would be disastrous to attempt to meet the problem by releasing out of turn those who are not for the time being usefully employedin the Forces through fortuitously being in this country. The pledges given tothe Forces that every effort will be made to release them in their turn wherever they may be serving have been taken literally by those serving overseas, and inour view any substantial departure from the strict age and service order in favourof men and women in this country would lead to the most serious breakdown inmorale and discipline.12. The question remains whether Service personnel who are not fully employed should be employed on useful civilian work.   To allow individuals to^30441 ] u 2
proceed on leave for this purpose would be interpreted as a device to cover theirpremature release, but we consider that the arrangements already made for theemployment of Service personnel in agriculture might be extended to other fields,and wre projpose to explore the possibilities in this direction.13. Publicity. We suggest that in order to steady public opinion thereshould be an immediate statement giving the facts about the present situation andthe progress of releases so far (a suggested draft is appended), and promising astatement on the man-power position and monthly statements of releases infuture. It is also for consideration whether the statement to be issuedimmediately should include an estimate of the position which it is hoped toreach by June 1946, which on present information would enable a total of over2-1 million to be released from the Forces. Such a statement would, in our view,bring about a complete change in the attitude of the public towards the Govern-menfs arrangements for release from the Forces and would have the effect ofcurbing much ill-informed criticism.APPENDIX.Draft Statement by the Minister of Labour and National Service.Release from the Forces.1. The Prime Minister in his broadcast on Monday evening stated that the paramount consideration which must govern our demobilisation policy is themaintenance of our Armed Forces at a level adequate to discharge our responsibilities as a Great Power in order to obtain a secure and lasting peace.He further stated that the re-allocation scheme devised by my predecessor,Mr. Bevin, would form the basis of the demobilisation plan and that there wouldbe no departure from the principles of that scheme. But it will be Kept under constant review and as a first step certain modifications are being made whichI shall explain in this statement.2. Releases from the Forces began on the 18th June, 1945, for Class Aand on the 16th July for Class B. They necessarily had to start slowly at thattime because, following the European Cease Fire, a major deployment of our forces for the war against Japan had to be effected. Apart from dischargeson medical grounds and compassionate releases, during the first four weeksup to the 16th July, 45,000 men and 25,000 women were released, making a totalof 70,000. The weekly rate of release was thus 17,500. During the last two weeks in July 35,000 men and 14,000 women were released, making a total of49,000.   The weekly rate of release had thus increased to 24,500.3. Immediately on the termination of the Japanese War the government made a rapid survey of the man-power situation, and Mr. George Isaacs, theMinister of Labour and National Service, was able to announce in the Houseof Commons on Thursday of last week that the release of men and women fromthe Forces would be speeded up to the extent that about a million men and women would be released before the end of the year in fact, the number released willbe 1,100,000. The effect of this speeding up will be that the rate of release forthe rest of this year will average about 45,000 a week, as at present planned andsubject to the continuous review to which I have referred.4. In connection with Class B releases, arrangements have been made tosecure a substantial speeding up. Up to now the releases in Class B in any one month have been limited to a fixed percentage of the Class A releases in that month. Subject to not increasing the total number released in this category, itis now proposed to release at once all those selected for Class B release. It hasalso been decided to improve the conditions of release in Class B by grantingpayment of war gratuity, post-war credit and leave payment in respect of over-seas service as soon as possible after release, instead of deferring these paymentsuntil the end of the emergency. These payments will be made retrospective to all those already released in Class B. It is not proposed to increase the period of21 days&apos; leave, since to do so would be contrary to the intention of Class B release,which is to get men back to urgent reconstruction work with the minimum of delay.5. In connection with Class B releases, I want particularly to emphasisethese changes because it is of the greatest importance that those who can help
in house-building and the other very urgent and special needs should volunteerto come out.6. A matter that has given rise to some misunderstanding about the rateof release from the Army has been the number of the release group to be reached by the end of this year. On the 16th May, 1945, Mr. Bevin told the House ofCommons that the Government then hoped to be able to release a global figureof 750,000 men and women from the Forces under Class A up to the end of theyear. This was an accurate statement of the position as it was then forecast.Later in the evening on the same day Mr. McCorquodale, in winding up the debate on behalf of the Government, referred to Mr. Bevin&apos;s statement earlier in the day as being a sort of &quot; hopeful target of release by the end of the year &quot;and then went on to say that the contemplated figure of releases &apos;&apos; as far as theArmy is concerned will bring them into the middle twenties.&quot; It is the use ofthe adjective &quot;middle&quot; in that statement that has given rise to themisunderstanding.7. The fact is that the War Office did not expect to be able to do morethan reach Group 21 by the end of 1945 and accordingly, on the 31st May, the then Minister of Labour, Mr. Butler, took the opportunity of clarifying thesituation in the House and said that Mr. McCorquodakVs &quot; statement went alittle too far and I think it would be safer to say the very early twenties.&quot; Inspite of this correction there is no doubt that the earlier statement gave riseto false hopes in many quarters. Mr. Isaacs, in his statement to the House ofCommons last week, said that as a result of the speeding up of releases Group 23in the Army would commence before the end of 1945. There has thus been an acceleration so far as the Army is concerned to the extent of bringing forwardinto 1945 the whole of Group 21, Group 22 and part of Group 23.8. It is perhaps not fully appreciated that there is a very wide disparity between numbers in the various release groups. Thus, in the Army, numbers inthe whole of Groups 1 to 10 amount to no more than about 88,000, whereas thenumbers in Groups 22 and 23 together are over 200,000 and in Group 26 alonethere are more than a quarter-of-a-million. The bringing forward, therefore,of one only of these large groups represents a substantial speeding up of release from the Army. There is a similar disparity in the numerical strength of therelease groups in the Royal Navy and the R.A.F.9. There is also a wide disparity between the numbers in a particularrelease group in the Royal Navy, the Army and the R.A.F. Thus, Group 26which, in the Army amounts to over a quarter-of-a-million, amounts to 16,500in the Royal Navy and 52,000 in the R.A.F. It is therefore impossible for thethree Services to keep in step as regards the release groups reached. Indeed,the true measure of the rate of release is not the serial number of the releasegroup published, but the numbers of men and women released.10. In announcing the speeding up of releases the Minister of Labourand National Service stated that a further review of military requirements was taking place. This review is being pursued with all speed, but as it mustnecessarily involve a survey of our commitments throughout the world consulta-tion with our Dominions and Allies and consideration of the transport facilitieslikely to be available for bringing troops home, it will obviously take a little time before it can be completed. It is hoped, however, that the review will becompleted and that the Government will be in a position to make a further detailed announcement about the end of September.11. In the meantime, the Government wish to make it clear that the onlyfactors affecting the rate of release are, on the one hand, our commitmentsthroughout the world (including the disposal of vast quantities of valuableequipment of all kinds) and, on the other, the availability of transportation by sea, air and land. Any suggestion that the speed of demobilisation is limitedeither by the employment situation at home or by inadequate facilities at the dispersal Centres is untrue. There is, at present, a serious shortage of man-power in this country.As stated by the Prime Minister in his broadcast, in order to restoreemployment in civilian and export manufacture and in non-manufacturing industries and services to the mid-1939 level an increase of about 5 million workers will be needed. Of the 1 million workers to be released from munitionsbefore the end of October and others which must inevitably be subsequentlyreleased, by no means all will be available for civilian industry.   Many of the
younger men are being called up to the Forces, while of the balance a largeproportion are older men, who wish to retire, and married women who willreturn to their homes. There need be no doubt that there is ample room forabsorbing the maximum numbers that can be released from the Forces.12. The end of the Japanese war has added to the demands upon shippingby the necessity for providing passages to this country, India or Australia forsome 150,000 prisoners of war who are obviously entitled to high priority. Allthe ships and aircraft that can be made available for this purpose will be employed,but the distances to be traversed are very great. Our shipping liabilities havealso been increased by the acceptance of responsibility for the South-West Pacific,which was formerly undertaken by the United States.13. As recently announced in the House of Commons, the length of the tour of duty for the Army and the R.A.F. abroad has been reduced and theGovernment is anxious to avoid any breakdown in fulfilling the promises madeto the men. The Government regard it as important not to divert transport ear-marked for bringing troops back to this country after an extended tour of. dutyabroad.14. It is the Government&apos;s aim to secure the earliest possible return totheir homes of the maximum number of men and women in the Forces. To assistthis, men aged 18-30 are being called up to the Forces unless they can be shown to be absolutely essential for reconstruction work; this applies particularly to those who are being released from munitions as a result of the cuts referredto above.15. Much prominence has been given to a number of cases where men andwomen in the Forces are temporarily idle or underemployed, and suggestions havebeen made that such persons serving in this country should be released out ofturn. Pledges have been given on more than one occasion to the men in theForces that men serving overseas will be released as near as possible in their turn with men in the same release groups at home. The Government does not propose to depart from this principle and have no intention of breaking faithwith members of the Forces overseas.16. The fact is that the Japanese war ended over a year before the date for which in common prudence we had to plan. Little over a fortnight agomany thousands of men of all three Services were being trained and assembledto proceed to South-East Asia and the Pacific to take their part in the japanese war. It is manifestly impossible to adjust the vast machinery of release andredeployment at a moment&apos;s notice, and it is inevitable that, at a time whenlarge numbers of men and women in the Forces are being re-sorted and re-posted,there should be, particularly in this country, some persons with little or nothing to do for the time being. The Service Departments are, however, constantlycarrying out the most rigorous examination to reduce to the absolute minimum the strength that must be retained to meet our heavy commitments in theoccupation period, to which the Prime Minister referred in his speech on the address.17. A further statement will shortly be made on the man-power position,and in future monthly announcements will be issued showing the progress of release from the Forces. It should be clearly understood that these officialannouncements will be the only authoritative information on the rate of release,and that unofficial speculation and unauthorised forecasts only lead to disappoint-ment and discontent among serving personnel and their families.
