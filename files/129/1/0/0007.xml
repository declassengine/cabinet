Op   ATHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET. Copy No.    36CP. (45) 107.11th August, 1945.CABINET.GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I must now ask the Cabinet to arrive at a conclusion regarding Greek policyand, after carefully studying the matter, I recommend as follows : *(i) We should press for the elections and plebiscite to be held in Greece assoon as possible. If it can be arranged, the elections should precedethe plebiscite, but this is a matter on which the Greeks themselvesmust take the initiative and responsibility.(ii) The Voulgaris Government should be maintained in power until theelections. All reasonable steps should, however, be taken to meetjustifiable criticism by the Left Wing Parties and to ensure that lawand order are maintained on an impartial basis.(iii) To steady the position in Greece and to assist us in working out asatisfactory Greek policy, the Regent should be invited to visit thiscountry to confer with His Majesty&apos;s Government.(iv) If Russia continues to press on with her propaganda regarding theposition of Greece, it will be necessary to make plain to the U.S.S.R.our position.(v) We should do our utmost to secure the full support of the Dominionsfor our whole Greek policy. We should also lose no opportunity of associating the United States Government in all the steps we take.2.   The reasons for these recommendations are : -(i) Greece must have a stable Government at the earliest possible moment.The politicians will continue to wrangle while the matter remainsunsettled.(ii) I am strongly in favour of maintaining the Voulgaris Government,otherwise there will be an unconscionable delay, which will mean themaintenance of British troops in the country for an indefinite period.(iii) It will give confidence to world opinion if the elections are held undersupervision, and I consider that we should invite Dominion Represen-tatives to take part with the United Kingdom as British observersfor this purpose. Both Australia and New Zealand were involvedin the fighting and are known there and will inspire confidence.(iv) The most overpowering reason of all is that we must maintain ourposition in Greece as a part of our Middle East policy, and unless it is asserted and settled it may have a bad effect on the whole of ourMiddle East position.E. 13.Foreign Office, 11th August, 1945.12876   [30336]
