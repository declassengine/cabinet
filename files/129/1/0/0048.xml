Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 148.5th September, 1945.CABINET.DEFENCE   AGAINST   DISEASE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I desire to call the attention of my colleagues to the dangers which arelikely to arise as a result of the conditions in central Europe. I had an oppor-tunity of discussing this matter with Sir William Strang and have also readseveral opinions which all point to the danger of epidemics arising from starvation-tion and cold during the forthcoming winter and the likelihood, if -this arises, ofit spreading to this country, affecting the health of our people and causingloss of production and, in consequence, affecting our recovery. It seems to me,therefore, that the Cabinet should give very serious consideration to the need of planning now counter-measures. I cannot see the possibility of supplyingeither coal or food in sufficient quantities and in time to counteract this danger.It seems, therefore, that we must concentrate on the organisation of medical help and decide what steps we can take in this country.2. The first question I would ask to be considered is, where should the lineof defence be % In my view, there should be a mobilisation of both medicalsupplies, vitamins and any extra foods we can possibly get together with medical services organised on the continent; and at home an immediate study should bemade as to how and in what way we can increase the supply of fats so as toimprove the resistance of our own people, should this danger develop. I would suggest that the measures to be taken in this country should be worked up by an interdepartmental planning staff who should also consult with U.N.R.R.A., theControl Commissions and other authorities with a view to the mobilisation ofall the medical services available in the liberated countries and the resources ofGermany itself so that they might be ready to meet an emergency should it arise.I would urge that immediate consideration be given to this problem.E. B.Foreign Office, 5th September, 1945.12903   [30462]
