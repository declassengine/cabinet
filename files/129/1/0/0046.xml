Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 148.4th September, 1945.CABINET.TREATMENT  OF  CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS  IN  THECIVIL SERVICE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.WITH reference to the Paper by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (CP. (45) 139), Ministers may wish to know the position in the CivilService.2. A number of conscientious objectors wrere directed to stay in the CivilService. In order that they should not profit by comparison with their colleagues in the Armed Forces, they have not been allowed to receive promotion. Wherethey have undertaken increased responsibilities, they have received no increasein pay.3. I propose that the ban on promotion should be lifted at the end of theyear. By then a substantial number of civil servants will have returned fromthe Forces and new recruits from the Forces will be beginning to appear.4. Conscientious objectors in the Civil Service who were directed to other forms of national service, not in the Armed Forces, broke their service. the coalition Government, however, agreed that men who obeyed the directions givento them should be reinstated, although their war service would not reckon for pension as the war service of other civil servants will reckon. conscientious objectors who refused to obey directions are not entitled to reinstatement, butthe case of a man who applies for reinstatement will be considered by theTreasury.   Instructions to this effect have already been issued to Departments.II. D.Treasury Chambers,4th September, 1945.Copy No.[30455]
