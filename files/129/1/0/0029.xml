Printed fd&amp;thmQabip%&amp; :gaiisim -SECRET.CP. (45) 129.28*A August, 1945.CABINET./ELECTORAL REGISTER. VJoint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.LEGISLATION will be required before the 31st December to make provisionfor an effective Parliamentary Register of Electors during the year 1946 inrespect of the following matters : I. The extension of validity of the October Parliamentary Registers;II. The extension of the Parliamentary Electors (War-Time Registration)Act, 1944; III. Supplementary Service Register; IV. The extension of absentvoting facilities; and V. Jury Lists in England and Wales.We also make recommendations in Part VI of this Memorandum withregard to long-term electoral policy.I. Extension of Validity of the October Parliamentary Registers.We recommend that legislation should be introduced to extend the validity of. the Register to be published annually in October (for which the qualifying date is the 30th June) until the 15th October following.2.   Under the Representation of the People Act, 1945, the Register to bepublished annually on the 15th October will be effective for parliamentary elections initiated in the period the 1st October to the 31st December of thisyear, and the period 10th September to the 31st December in subsequent years.For elections initiated in the period 1st January to the 9th September theexisting law requires the preparation of ad hoc Civilian and Service Registers.Experience gained in the course of preparing the May and October Registershas satisfied us that it would be quite impracticable to prepare an ad hoc Registernext year for the whole country for a General Election.  The procedure involves the printing and publishing of Electoral Lists, their revision after the disposalof claims and objections, and thereafter the final printing of the Register, all ina period of 36 days.   Although the time available for the preparation of theRegister to be published in October was considerably longer and although certainpreliminary steps were taken in advance, there is going to be the greatest difficultyin ensuring its punctual publication, for the position in the printing industry isnow worse than it was in the spring, owing largely to the retirement of the olderoperatives and the absence of replacements from the Forces.   We are advised that there is no likelihood of an early improvement in this position, and accordingly we are faced with the probability that it would be impossible, underthe law as it stands to cater for a General Election during the first nine months of1946, and indeed the same difficulty may arise in 1947.   There are graveconstitutional objections to such a situation : hence the recommendation at thehead of this paragraph.   The only alternative would be to extend the OctoberRegister to the spring of the following year and to provide for the publicationof a Spring Register in, say, April, to remain in force until October.   We donot consider, however, that the expense and the heavy strain which would be thrown on the depleted staffs of Electoral Registration Officers and on the printing industry would justify the preparation of a fresh Register every sixmonths.  The disadvantages of continuing for twelve months an October Registerbased upon the qualifying date the 30th June, 1945, would be mitigated if theproposal made in Part IV below, for the extension of absent voting facilities,is accepted.[30405]
II. Extension of the Parliamentary Electors (War-Time Registration) Act, 1944.- . We recommend that the Act of 1944 should be extended until31st December, 1946.3. In providing for a system of continuous registration based on materialderived from National Registration records, the Parliament (Elections andMeeting) Act, 1943, laid it down that a person would be qualified for registration in a constituency where he had been residing continuously for two months, and once so qualified would remain qualified until he became qualified for registration in another constituency. This provision proved to be too complicated to operate with the depleted staffs of the Electoral Registration Officers, and the Parlia-mentary Electors (War-Time Registration) Act, 1944, suspended the two months&apos;residence qualification. In consequence, the basis of the Register which will bepublished in October 1945 is the place at which the elector was registered in theNational Register as residing on a single qualifying date 30th June, 1945.4. The Act of 1944 will expire on the 31st December, 1945, unless extended by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. If it is allowed to expire the twomonths&apos; residence qualification under the Act of 1943 will be revived. the requirement of a two months&apos; qualifying period was agreed to by the representa-tives of each-of the main political parties who served on the Committee of 1942on Electoral Machinery; but whatever may be the arguments for or againstincorporating this requirement in any permanent legislation, it would be quite impracticable to operate with the staffs available to Electoral Registration officers the complicated procedure required for ascertaining whether a person had residedin any constituency for a period of two months. The extension recommendedcould conveniently be effected by a provision in the proposed Bill instead of byresolutions of both Houses of Parliament. The basis of the annual Register tobe produced in 1947 would be determined in the light of the further enquiries which we propose in Part VI below.HI. Supplementary Service Register.We recommend that a Supplementary Service Register should bepublished on the 1st March, 1946, so as to be available for the local electionsheld in the spring as well as for any parliamentary elections initiated after that date.   This Supplementary Register should contain-. (a) the names of all Service voters whose declarations have been received in the period bettveen the 30th June, 1945, and the 26th January,1946; and(b) the names of all persons discharged from the Forces or from theMerchant Navy after the 30th June, 1945.5. The postal voting procedure at the General Election resulted in applica-tions for postal votes being made by many persons who had not made servicedeclarations and were not therefore included in the Service Register. wherever possible, steps were taken to communicate with such persons and advise them ofthe need to make declarations. In the result a substantial number of fresh-declarations were received, but a large proportion of these were received afterthe 30th June, 1945, which is the latest date prescribed by the existing law for* receipt of declarations for inclusion in the October Service Register.     It is obviously undesirable that such declarations received after the 30th June, 1945,should not become effective &quot;until the publication of a new Register inOctober 1946, and the recommendations above are designed to prevent this long delay.6. The position has also to be considered of persons discharged from theEorces or from the Merchant Service after the 30th June, 1945. If such personshave made Service declarations before that date they will be on the ServiceRegister published in October 1945. If they have not made Service declarations,they will be neither on the Service Register nor on the Civilian Register, sinceService voters discharged after the 30th June do not rank for inclusion in the civilian Register to be published on the 15th October, 1945. Such persons ought not to be deprived of a vote until the publication of a Register in October 1946.7. Our recommendations will mean that the names of those who have madeService declarations might be duplicated, e.g., by inclusion in both the OctoberService register and in the Supplementary Service Register published on the1st March, 1946.   This duplication, however, is unavoidable, and we think any
disadvantages which may arise from such duplication are. far less than the*disadvantage of leaving those who failed to make Service declarations withoutvote till October, 1946. Such persons, however, should not be entitled to appointproxies as they will in fact be civilians resident in this country.IY. Extension of Absent Voting Facilities.We recommend that there should be a wide extension of postal votingfacilities and that the law should be amended so as to make such facilities available on application to all persons who have removed from the addressesfor which they are registered, subject to a discretion in the electoral registration Officer concerned to reject an application if it appears to him,from a comparison of the two addresses, that an elector could, without serious difficulty, vote in person. We also recommend that the procedure we havesuggested for the claiming of a postal vote should be open to a personappointed as proxy for a service voter.8. The existing law limits postal voting facilities for civilians to those persons &quot; who by reason of the nature of their Occupation, service or employ-ment &quot; are unlikely to be able to vote in person. In present circumstances, whenlarge-scale movements of population are taking place, the number of personswho are prevented by distance from voting in person in the constituency inwhich they are registered is inevitably large, even if the interval between the qualifying date and polling day is only a few months. If the October registeris to remain in operation for twelve months, the number liable to be so preventedwill be larger.9. At the same time effect should be given to the recommendation of the speaker&apos;s Conference that postal voting facilities should be extended to personswho are physically incapacitated from coming to the polling station.10. A postal vote should also, we consider, be available to a proxy appointedby a service voter if, by reason of a proxy removing from, or not residing in, the locality containing the address for which the service voter is registered, the proxyis not able without serious difficulty to vote in person.Y. Jury Lists.We recommend that provision should be made in the Bill for the compilation of fresh Jury Lists for England and Wales based on the electoral Register to be prepared in 1946.11. Provision should be made in the proposed Bill for the preparation of fresh Jury Lists for England and Wales. The existing Jury Lists are based onthe Electoral Register of 1939, that is to say, the Lists for each area contain the names of those persons who were registered as electors for the area in 1939and were qualified to serve as jurors. These Lists are by now gravely defective.They contain the names of many persons who have left the district and of personswho are now over the age of sixty-five, which is the limit of age for a juror&apos;service; and they do not contain the names of persons who have moved into thedistrict since 1939 or have attained the age of twenty-one since that date. Inconsequence of the defensive character of the Jury Lists, it is necessary, in orderto ensure the attendance of an adequate number of jurors, to issue double thenumber of summonses which would be required if an up-to-date List wereavailable.VI. Long-term Policy.We recommend the appointment at an early date of a Committee chargedwith the duty of considering and advising what, if any, changes should bemade in the machinery of electoral registration to bring it to peace-time requirements and to what extent use should continue to be made of postal and proxy voting.This Committee should report in time to enable the necessary legislation(which could, at the same time, deal with the outstanding recommendationsof the Speaker&apos;s Conference) to be prepared and passed in 1946 and to come,into effect from 1947.
12. Our proposals indicated above are necessary in order to adapt theexisting registrationia^rangementS;to;,the^present transitional period and to thepractical difficulties occasioned by the acute shortage of staff for registration officers ah^&quot;fdiTpTinters. &quot;ThtsTs &quot;essentially ashort-term policy and does not attempt to define the position beyond 1946 or to settle the permanent lines of post-war electoral registration. We consider, however, that it is of importance that the basic decisions on which a permanent policy can be built should betaken as soon as possible. For instance, it has to be decided whether theRegister to be prepared in 1947 and subsequent years should continue to becompiled from National Registration records or by canvass, as before the war,whether the existing arrangements for the registration of service voters shouldbe retained, whether the qualifying period contained in the Representation ofthe People Act, 1918, should be revived, modified, or abolished, and whetherservice postal voting arrangements should be continued beyond the end of thisyear.13. It would seem that the appointment of a Committee, consisting ofM.P.s representing the main political parties, the Chief Party Agents,representative Electoral Registration Officers, and Departmental representa-tives would be the best body from which to obtain expert advice on these matters.14. ,We ask for approval to the drafting forthwith of a Bill covering our proposals in Parts I to V with a view- to its passage before the end of the year,and to the constitution of the Committee proposed in Part VI.J.
