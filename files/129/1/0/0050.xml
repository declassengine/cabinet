Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECEET.CP. (45) 150.5th September, 1945.AFGHANISTAN: DISTURBANCES IN THE EASTERN PROVINCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.FOR some months past the Afghan Government have been facing a growinginsurgence among the tribesmen of their Eastern Province, of which Jalalabadis the administrative Headquarters. This insurgence has culminated in the siegeof the Afghan military post at Kunar (in the extreme Eastern part of the EasternProvince), which is reported to be in imminent danger of being overwhelmed. the tribesmen involved are believed to be mainly from Afghan territory, but theAfghan Government represent that they have been joined by others from theIndian side of the international boundary.As a result of an urgent personal appeal by the Afghan Prime Minister toHis Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Kabul, the Governor of the North-west frontier Province was authorised by the Government of India on the1st September to take air action by the dropping of warning leaflets, to be followedif necessary by bombing, in the Bohai Dag. This is an area lying to the east of the Durand Line, but to the West of the &quot; presumptive line.&quot;The Durand Line is the frontier shown in the map attached to the DurandAgreement of 1863. This line was not accepted by the then Amir in respect ofthe Mohmand territory now in question and has never been demarcated in theseparts. The &quot;presumptive&quot; line is the line designed to show the Eastern and southern boundaries of certain villages on the Indian side of the Durand Line,which, in 1896, were offered as a concession to the Afghan Government. This linealso has never been formally accepted or demarcated, but in recent years has been treated by the Afghan Government and the Government of India as a workingbasis for the discharge of their respective responsibilities for maintaining orderin this area. The confused position results that the tribes inhabiting theBohai. Dag can be represented either as an Afghan or as an Indian responsibility.The Afghan Government have themselves been bombing lashkars and villagesnearer the centre of the disturbance, but their efforts have been restricted by shortage of bombs.The action now contemplated is calculated to avoid the occurrence of aserious situation in the Eastern Province of Afghanistan which would result ifthe Afghan post at Kunar were overwhelmed, in which case the insurgents wouldbe almost certainly joined by other elements from among the undoubtedly Afghantribes. The information at the disposal of Major Crichton, Charge d&apos;Af!airesat Kabul, based on local reports, is that the Afghan Government has not been insuch a dangerous situation for many years.This is a matter in which the situation is best left to be dealt with by theGovernment of India and the Governor of the North-West Frontier Province,who are in close consultation with Flis Majesty&apos;s representative in Kabul andmay be relied on to discharge their distasteful task of keeping order on thefrontier with the minimum force required.J?.-L.India Office, 5th September, 1945.Copy No.CABINET.[30465]
