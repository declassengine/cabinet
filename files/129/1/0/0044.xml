Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 144.1st September, 1945./CABINET.FUTURE OF THE ITALIAN COLONIES.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I am not satisfied with the arguments and conclusions as to the future ofthe Italian Colonies put forward by the Foreign and Colonial Secretaries.1. At the back of all the argument is the idea of the defence of the BritishEmpire leading to conclusions as to the importance of our retaining control of strategic areas in the Middle East.2.&quot; Quite apart from the advent of the atomic bomb which should affectall considerations of strategic area, the British Commonwealth and Empire isnot a unit that can be defended by itself. It was the creation of sea power.With the advent of air warfare the conditions which made it possible to defend a  string of possessions scattered ever five continents by means of a Fleet basedon island fortresses have gone. In the 19th century the passage of the Mediter-ranean could be secured by sea power with Gibraltar, Malta and Egypt as itsbases. In the air age the neutrality, if not the support, of all countries contiguousto the route are needed.  This is only one example.3. The British Empire can only be defended by its membership of the united nations Organisation. If we do not accept this, we had better say so. If wedo accept this we should seek to make it effective and not at the same time acton outworn conceptions. If the new organisation is a reality, it does not matterwho holds Cyrenaica or Somalia or controls the Suez Canal. If it is not a realitywe had better be thinking of the defence of England, for unless we can protect the home country no strategic positions elsewhere will avail.4. Apart from strategic considerations, I can see no possible advantage tous in assuming responsibility for these areas. They involve us in immediate loss.There is no prospect of their paying for themselves. The more we do for them the quicker shall we be faced with premature claims for self-government. Wehave quite enough of these awkward problems already.[30440]\
5. After the last war, under the system of mandates, we acquired largeterritories. The world outside not unnaturally regarded this as a mere expansionof the British Empire. Trusteeship will appear to most people as only oldmandates writ large.6. Cyrenaica will saddle us with an expense that we can ill afford. why should we have to bear it ? Why should it be assumed that only a few great Powerscan be entrusted with backward peoples? Why should not one or other of the scandinavian countries have a try? They are quite as fitted to bear rule as ourselves.   Why not the United States ?7. British Somaliland has always been a dead loss and a nuisance to us.We only occupied it as part of the scramble for Africa. If we now add Ogadenand Italian Somaliland we shall have a troublesome ward with an unpleasantneighbour in Ethiopia. The French are on the spot in French Somaliland.Why not let them have it if they like ? It will be a sop to their pride, and may help them to put up with the loss of their position in the Levant. There would,of course, be the sentimental objection to giving up a piece of the Empire, but otherwise it would be to our advantage to get rid of this incubus.8. While condominia elsewhere have been failures because they were atpoints where there was rivalry between the Powers as at Tangier, I see noobjection to trying the experiment of international administration in Somalia.It is out of the way of other countries except Ethiopia, where an example ofdisinterested rule would be good for the Negus who himself could do with someinternational tutelage.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,1st September, 1945.
