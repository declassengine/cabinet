, . 3- 6/^-..THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.   &apos;SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 130.28th August, 1945.CABINET.MIDDLE EASTERN POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I am thinking of summoning His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the middle east to a meeting in London in the immediate future to discuss with me ourMiddle Eastern policy. Before so doing, I shall be glad to be assured that mycolleagues approve the lines on which I propose to conduct these discussions.2. In particular, I would like my colleagues to consider the fundamentalquestion whether we are to continue to assert our political predominance in theMiddle East and our overriding responsibility for its defence, or whether,alternatively, it is thought to be essential on financial and man-power grounds that we should seek the extensive assistance of other Powers in the defence of theMiddle East. This question was raised some weeks ago in connexion with theproblem of the defence of the Suez Canal (see Cabinet Paper W.P. (45) 197 ofthe 20th March, 1945), while my predecessor&apos;s views were circulated to theCabinet in W.P. (45) 256; and I would like it now to be considered in the widerframework of the Middle East as a whole.3. The moment is clearly opportune for a general review of our middle eastern policy. With the end of the Far Eastern war our forces will have tobe redistributed, and certain areas, including the whole of Persia, evacuated,and this will naturally have repercussions on British policy in those territories.The decision not to appoint a successor to Lord Altrincham as Resident minister in the Middle East also raises certain problems, particularly in connection withthe co-ordination of policy. The Middle East Supply Centre, the Anglo-American body which has been concerned with supplying the economic needs ofthe whole area during the war, will shortly be closing down, and there arearrangements to be made for carrying on part of its functions. Above all, it will shortly be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take an important decision regarding their Palestine policy, such as may affect the British position through-out the Middle East.4. I propose also to discuss with our representatives.the question how, now that the war has ceased, it can be assured that the British military authoritiesin the Middle East will accept political guidance from the civil authorities. Theabolition of the post of Minister Resident makes it necessary that some new arrangement should be introduced to cover this point.5. I propose to invite our representatives to discuss with me a new economic policy covering the area as a whole. I am anxious to promote schemes of economic development, which would benefit the common people, and I attach importance to measures of social advancement which would improve trade conditions. It seemsto me that advantage might well be taken of the presence in Cairo of the experts of the Middle East Supply Centre, some of whom have had many years&apos; experienceof the economic conditions in the area, and it seems important to set this neweconomic policy in motion before the Middle East Supply Centre is closed andits experts disperse. Perhaps also we might contribute to the welfare of theMiddle Eastern countries by providing them with medical services. In general,I feel that there is a great deal which might usefully be done, that the middle eastern countries are probably able themselves to bear the greater part of thecost of such measures, but that they require technical assistance, which we shalleventually be able to provide.Foreign Office, 28th August, 1945.12892   [30404]
