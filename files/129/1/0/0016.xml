0 a-.Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECEET. Copy No.CP. (45) 116.16th August, 1945.CABINET.ARTICLE VII  OF  THE  MUTUAL  AID  AGREEMENT:COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. The question of Commercial Policy comes up as a matter of urgency onaccount of certain discussions at Potsdam between the Prime Minister and president Truman, when it was understood that Mr. Clayton would be taking up the subject of Article VII during his visit to this country. Mr. Clayton&apos;visit has coincided with the imminent end of Lend-Lease supplies, and the wholequestion of our ability to finance our imports arises simultaneously with thequestion of the regime which will govern our long-term trading practices.2. Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement (signed the 23rd February1942) formed part of the consideration on which we received Lend-Leaseassistance and the signature created an obligation vis-a-vis the United states which must be honoured, though there is obviously scope for argument and negotiation as to the precise shape of the arrangements to be made.3.   The crucial words are : &quot; (The terms and conditions) shall include provision for agreed action-  by the United States and the United Kingdom open to participation by allother countries of like mind, directed to the expansion by appropriate inter-national and domestic measures, of production, employment, (&amp;c.).....;to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in internationalcommerce, and to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers . . . .Conversations shall be begun between the two Governments with a view to determining, in the light of governing economic conditions, the best means ofobtaining the above-stated objectives by their own agreed action and of seeking the agreed action of other like-minded Governments.&quot;4. After a provisional conclusion (W.M. (43) 50th Conclusions) by theWar Cabinet in April 1943 (on W.P. (43) 136) and discussion with dominion and Indian officials in June 1943, United Kingdom officials were authorised totake the initiative in opening exploratory and non-committal discussions with united States officials. These took place in Washington in September-October,1943.5. The policy advocated in these discussions was a multilateral international convention under which agreed limits would be set to all protective measures anddiscriminatory practices would be forbidden.   The proposals involved (a) the reduction of tariffs;(b) the narrowing of preferential margins;(c) the abolition of export subsidies (but not of general subsidies to production)&apos;;(d) rules designed to prevent the use of States trading in ways which wouldinfringe either the agreed limits of protection or the rules againstdiscriminatory trading;.(e) import quotas would have been banned save when exceptionally permitted to remedy a disequilibrium in the balance of payments.It was recognised tha.t such a regime could not come into full force during thefirst period of economic reconstruction and that many improvisations would haveto be allowed for a transition period. An International Trade organisation would be set up, of which the adherent countries would be members to supervise[30365]
the execution of the agreement and to serve as forum forjhe discussion of inter-national trade questions.6. Until Mr. Clayton&apos;s arrival the broad lines of this approach held thefield in our discussions, subject to important modifications noted later in regardto agriculture, and to proposals advocated by some Dominions for allowingtemporary protection to infant industries in excess of the normal agreed limits.From the United Kingdom point of view the chief arguments used in favour ofa multilateral approach on these lines were : (a) A wide-spread reduction of trade barriers is in the interests of thiscountry, both because of the wide range and diversified character of our exports and because our total export trade is built up more than thatof any nation on a multiplicity of overseas markets. Only if thereis general expansion of international trade can we hope to secure the share necessary to finance our import needs.(&amp;) Bilateral negotiations with the United States will not open up export markets there which will make it worth while or even possible for usto make substantial concessions in Imperial Preference. In spiteof the reservations as to Imperial Preference made between mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt (as interpreted by Mr. Churchill inthe House of Commons Debate on Commonwealth Unity, 21st April,1944) it was known that the Americans would press us very stronglyon the doctrine that preference is discrimination which underArticle VII must be eliminated while tariffs are only reduced. we and the Dominions should not be dealt with one at a time andsqueezed on preference reductions. Such reductions would, however,be possible as part of a drastic and simultaneous reduction of trade barriers by all important trading nations.(c) Though a large number of bilateral negotiations on a most favoured nation basis could perhaps eventually produce some progress towardsthe desired results, such negotiations would be protracted. Theycould hardly hope to cover the field before we get lost again in athicket of high tariffs and quota restrictions during the transition,whereas&quot; if a better regime were worked out internationally for adoption as soon as circumstances permit, the drift into chaos mightbe arrested. Quota restrictions could not be dealt with effectivelyby most favoured national bilateral treaties. Bilateral treaties of abarter or &quot; matched purchase&quot; kind tend to prevent a generalexpansion of trade and their discriminatory character, which is contrary to Article VII, cannot produce expansion and can lead toacute international friction.7. Differences of view in the Cabinet arrested further discussion with the americans during 1944. But further non-committal discussions were permittedwith Dominion Officials in February-March (W.M. (44) 24th Conclusions) andthere was some discussion with Dominion Prime Ministers in London in May ofthat year.8. In July 1944 the Americans became restive and pressed for a resumption.Ministers instructed officials to insert fresh proposals for the special treatmentof agricultural products and at the end of 1944 (C.C.P. (44) 4th Meeting)approved a resumption of talks with United States officials, this time in london on the lines proposed in C.C.P. (44) 3 and 4. The basis was that agriculturalfoodstuffs should be treated on different principles, viz., any form of protection(including quota restriction) could be used for foodstuffs provided it did not raise the price to the consumer by more than a percentage to be agreed, and thatprotection should be scaled down when at any time it raised production of anygroup of foodstuffs above an agreed quantum. The remaining proposalsmentioned in paragraph 4 above remained unaffected.9. On this basis talks were resumed here with Mr. Hawkins and otherAmerican officials in December and were continued intermittently into this summer. Up to the last few weeks, while reactions were not very definite fromthe American side, there was every reason to suppose that the american administration still favoured a multilateral approach on these or similar lines.They had publicly stated that they were proposing to convene an international conference early in 1946. The passage of the Doughton Bill renewing theUnited States Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act with increased powers to reduce
[tariffs was regarded as an encouraging sign, although some pledges which weregiven to secure its passage (in the form of a message from President Truman and otherwise) gave rise to certain doubts whether the Americans could any longerface a uniform all-round tariff cut.10. Mr. Clayton on his arrival made it quite clear that the pledges whichwere given by President Truman during the debate on the Doughton Bill commit the Administration to selective tariff reductions by bilateral treaties after the pattern of the pre-war procedures. The school of thought has prevailed withinthe United States Administration which holds that the all-round tariff cut wouldnot have held out hope of success as a method of securing effective reductions.This change of front is accompanied by proposals for an alternative treatment ofthe problem which, though they oannot yet be regarded as representing the finalattitude of the United States Administration, must be taken as affording a firmindication of the lines on which their thought has crystallised. The american proposals take the following form : (i) All reduction of tariffs should be dealt with by bilateral bargains; but all other aspects of commercial policy (including quotas, State trading,export subsidies and Imperial Preference) multilaterally by agreement on general formulae to be applied to them. Commodity policy andcartel policy would be included in this multilateral negotiation,(ii) A nucleus group of the principal trading nations would be convenedto deal both with the bilateral tariff negotiations and with the multi-lateral negotiations on- the other aspects.(iii) The various commitments resulting from these two sets of negotiations would he brought into force together at their conclusion as, in effect,a single instrument of agreement.(iv) Such a nucleus group would consist of at least twelve and possibly someseventeen countries,(v) In place of our agricultural proposals, which are not accepted, reliancewould be placed upon tariffs, supplemented if desired by internalsubsidies and by quota restrictions, the latter subject to the proviso that similar measures of internal restriction were simultaneously inforce. The Americans would not rule out the further possibility ofState trading, subject to the principles that &quot; commercial considera-tions &quot; only should apply in such ,trading and that its protective effectswere progressively lessened.(vi) They would agree to ban export subsidies,. subject to the importantexception that these would be permitted in relation to a commoditydeclared to be in world surplus supply. Their use would be a preludeto the negotiation of an international agreement about the particularcommodity.(vii) The American proposals retain the important feature by which import restrictions are allowed to countries in balance of payments difficulties as a temporary measure for restoring equilibrium- The maintenanceof exchange restrictions after an initial transition period of five years would, however, be subject to the approval of the international monetary Fund.(viii) On cartels the Americans adhere to the line they have taken from the outset, viz., that certain characteristic types of cartel practices shouldbe denned and outlawed by international action.(The new American proposals retain the idea of setting up an international trade Organisation with much the same powers and functions as were originally contemplated see last sentence of paragraph 5 above.)11. If the Americans continue to take the line that fulfilment of Article VIIdepends on our accepting this set of proposals as they stand, the difficulties in reaching agreement with them may well prove insuperable. A major stumblingblock lies in their present refusal to agree that tariffs and preferences shouldbe dealt with on the same footing in the bilateral negotiations. The arguments against permitting such a separation are twofold :  [a) If separated, Imperial Preference will be subject to doctrinal pressure on the text of Article VII as interpreted by the Americans, with allthe emphasis on the word &quot; elimination &quot; (see paragraph 6 (b) above).(b) As a practical matter it is in fact not possible to consider what reductions in most favoured nation rates of duty can be contemplated unless theextent of the concessions to be made on preferences is simultaneouslynegotiated.
The Americans have repeatedly been told that the question of imperial preference will only be manageable politically in this country if it is dealt withtemperately, but they appear to be returning to an intransigent attitude on thispoint. In any event, the preferences which our manufactured exports receivein the Dominions are of substantial benefit to us, and the loss of them couldnot be compensated fully by any concession which we are at all likely to obtain from the Americans on the basis of negotiation proposed by them.12. Secondly, the rejection of the multilateral method of tariff reduction infavour of the method of bilateral tariff negotiations must in itself involve aserious reduction of the benefits we can hope to receive in this respect, both because the resulting reductions will be far less sweeping and widespread, and because the process of negotiating them will be much slower and more piecemeal.While it may be unprofitable to press the Americans to -revert to the multilateral,method (which would admittedly raise considerable difficulties), we should notbe asked to pay the same price in the shape of reduced preferences, &amp;c, for thenarrower benefits obtainable from bilateral tariff negotiations.13. A third major objection arises against the American proposal in 10 (vi)above, viz., that the use of export subsidies should be allowed in the case of commodities in world surplus. This (as already shown recently in the case ofcotton) would allow them to use their long purse as a negotiating weapon tosecure their own high-cost exports against the competition of lower-cost producing countries.14. In sum, the effect of the new American proposals on the freedom per-mitted to us in the conduct of our financial and import trade policy in the transition period and on the length of this period will require the most carefulscrutiny.15. If, as I understand, we are likely to be discussing with the americans in the near future the financial arrangements on the cessation of Lend-Lease,we must not fail to recognise the fact that assistance on the scale required willnot be forthcoming unless the Americans have obtained from us some assurances of our readiness to enter upon international discussions on commercial policyand related questions with the determination to seek an international tradingagreement on the general lines that they propose. This has been made clear bothby Mr. Clayton in his present talks and in a recent published letter fromMr. Grew, Acting Secretary of State, to a Congressman in which he said We feel that any credit granted by this country to Great britain should be accompanied by satisfactory arrangements with respect to thetimely relaxation of the restrictive financial and trade practices which have grown up of necessity during the war.&quot;16. If this, as I believe, correctly represents the American attitude, our consideration of the financial problem, on which the Chancellor of the Exchequerwill be submitting his views, must clearly be accompanied by consideration of thequestions of commercial policy with which the issue of the financial negotiationswill be closely bound up.E.
