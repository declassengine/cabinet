EH! D0CUMBNT 18 THE PSOPSRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJSSTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET. /        Copy No.CP. (45) 139.31st August, 1945.CABINET.RELEASE OF CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED conscientious objectors FROM THEIR CONDITIONS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I desire authority to proceed with the urgent preparation of a short Billamending the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939, in such a way as to release from their conditions the twenty-five thousand men (and a few hundredwomen) who are conditionally registered conscientious objectors, on a basiscomparable with that of the release from the Army of men in Class A.2. Under the terms of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939,Section 5 (6) (b), a conscientious objector who is ordered by a Tribunal to be registered in the Register of Conscientious Objectors on conditions, is bound by such conditions &quot; until the end of the present emergency.&quot; There is at present no legal power to terminate such conditions before that event, the date of whichhas yet to be fixed.3. It seems reasonable to modify the Act now in such a way as to give powerto release conditionally registered conscientious objectors from their conditionsbefore the legal end of the present emergency.4. If amending legislation on these lines was agreed, I should propose to release conditionally registered conscientious objectors from their conditions bygroups based on their age and the length of time during which they have beenconditionally registered as conscientious objectors, arranging, so far as possible,for the groups to be released after the completion of the release of the equivalentArmy groups based on age and length of service.5. The persons so released from their conditions would be subject to such control as might at the time be applicable to other civilians of the same age.6. In my view the above proposals would be acceptable to public opinion and equitable to the individual.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,31st August, 1945.[30432]
