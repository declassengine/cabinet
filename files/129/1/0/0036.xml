Printed for the Cabinet, August, 1945TOP SECRETCP. (45) 1362,0th August, 1945The  circulation of this   paper  has  been strictly   limited.    It   is  issued   for   the personal use of^* fCopy No. 3 8CABINETTHE &quot;DAILY WORKER&quot; AND ACCREDITED WARCORRESPONDENTSMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI. During the course of the war. the practice grew up of accrediting to a field force (a) limited number of war correspondents, dependent upon the circumstances and theparticular campaign. These correspondents were nominated by the Press agencies andthe national and provincial dairy newspapers, and the names were submitted to the WarOffice by the Newspaper and Periodical Emergency Council. The War Office, in turn,submitted the names to the Security Service and if they were accepted by the latter, thecorrespondents were accredited to the force in question.2. The effect of such accreditation has been that the correspondents are entitled tobe treated as officers, are provided with subsistence, accommodation, transport and communications by the military, and, whilst hostilities continued, were in possessionof much important military information either imparted in confidence, or gathered fromtheir daily contacts with the forces. Their despatches have been subject to the militarycensorship of the theatre in which they have been operating. In the absence of anaccredited war correspondent, a newspaper is dependent on agency news services forinformation from the areas in question, such news services being shared with its competitors.3. Although operations in Europe have ceased, only accredited war correspondentsare, as yet, permitted entry into British (and American) zones of occupation in Germanyand Austria. This limitation may not continue for any length of time, but the presentshortages of food, transport, accommodation and communications in Germany and austria appear, apart from other reasons, to justify the continuance of the presentsystem for the time being.4. At the beginning of 1943, shortly after it was permitted to resume publication,the Daily Worker asked to be allowed to have accredited war correspondents, firstly in north Africa, and later in this country as well. With Ministerial approval, this request was not rejected, but it was decided that names submitted by the Daily Worker shouldbe put to the Security Service in the ordinary way. It was known, however, that theSecurity Service would reject any names submitted by the Daily Worker, and this, infact, happened to four names which were submitted.5. In January, 1944, the Cabinet decided that, as a matter of principle, no warcorrespondents of the Daily Worker should be accredited because of the danger to security, and with Cabinet approval, Sir James Grigg explained on 18th January, 1944,in answer to a question in the House of Commons, that the reason for the decision ofthe Government was that the Daily Worker was the propagandist medium of the Com-munist Party of Great Britain and that some of its members or adherents had shownthat they were ready to subordinate the security of the State to the purposes of the Party.6. Immediately after V.E.-Day, the Daily Worker made a further application toSir James Grigg requesting that the whole matter be reconsidered in the light of the changed situation. This request was submitted to Mr. Churchill, but no decision hadbeen given upon it at the time of the change of Government. On 7th August, the editor of the Daily Worker renewed his application for the accreditation of a daily worker war correspondent in a letter to me.7. Now that hostilities both in Europe and the Far East have ended, it seems to methat the grounds on which the earlier requests of the Daily Worker were refused are nolonger applicable. There is no longer any danger that a Daily Worker accredited warcorrespondent might communicate to his paper and thus to the Communist Party,information about forthcoming military operations.
Moreover, the continued refusal to grant the Daily Worker request would be hardlyconsistent with certain matters discussed at the Potsdam Conference. Thus, at that conference, agreement was reached in the following terms: &quot; The Three governments have no doubt that in view of the changed conditions resulting from the termination ofthe war in Europe, representatives of the Allied Press will enjoy full freedom to reportto the world upon developments in Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland &quot;.Moreover, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs urged at the Conference, acceptanceof the following principle: &quot; Subject to normal regulations, there should be freecirculation of nationals of the Powers represented on the Control Council in all zones byland and air &apos;&apos;. This principle was submitted to the Allied Control Council for germany for their consideration, since the Russians thought that there were technical detailsrequiring examination. The principle, if accepted, would mean the free circulation of press correspondents, amongst others, between the various zones; this in turn wouldmake it illogical to maintain any longer the ban on accrediting a war correspondent ofthe Daily Worker, since were there any danger to security in such accreditation, itwould be as great from a correspondent accredited to another zone.8. I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that I should accede to the request ofthe Daily Worker that they may be permitted to have accredited war correspondents andthat, in this matter, they should receive comparable treatment to that accorded to theother daily newspapers.j. j- l.The War Office,30th August, 1945&apos;.(B45/67)   no  8/45   W.O.P.   23488
