SECRET.I CP. (45) 135.29th August, 1945.CABINET.Copy N&amp;d 0SHIPPING AND SHIPPING POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.I seek the endorsement of the Cabinet on the following points of policy :  1. While dispensing to the utmost with other forms of American shippingaid, in view of the altered Lease-Lend situation, we should make every endeavourto secure continuance of the charters of the American ships now under british flag Jor a limited period, preferably not exceeding three years, with an option tous to terminate earlier on suitable terms. This will involve a dollar commitmentbut one which, in my opinion, can and should be accepted.       ftr&quot;2. In approaching the problem of disposal of the heavy surplus of certain types of wartime ship, we should make it clear to the United States that we cannot afford to accept any reductions in the amount of tonnage we are able to keep at sea. At the same time we should adopt a helpful attitude in easing the surplusby any minor palliatives open to us, e.g., by scrapping tonnage which it has ceased to be economical to run.3. We should take no steps towards terminating the United MaritimeAuthority Agreement in advance of its expiration in February next, and should support the view that it should be continued till then in the event of any other country proposing an earlier termination.4. During the remaining period of the operation of the Agreement we should consist-operate with other countries in simplifying procedures with a view to assist-ing reversion to more normal commercial conditions.5. If any other country should raise the question of prolonging the united maritime Authority Agreement in a simplified form, or of substituting for itsome other form of international co-operation, we should for the time being adopta non-committal attitude till we are better able to gauge the prospects of any arrangement in a form acceptable to us.As there will be a meeting of the United Maritime Executive Board in washington, in a month or six weeks&apos; time, and in view of the Lease-Lend develop-ment, I should be glad of an immediate decision upon the proposals discussed inthis memorandum.Continuance of Charters on American ships.So far as can be seen, in the changed situation resulting from the end of thewar with Japan, our shipping resources should suffice to meet the demands likelyto be made upon them in the near future, subject to one most important proviso.Subject to that proviso we should be able, without having to purchase freight in dollars, to provide sufficient ships to lift supplies available for our import require-ments, to meet military programmes, and to have some margin for the miscellan-Carbonaceous cross trades and shipping services which are so important to the economy of the Commonwealth and Empire and to our own freight earnings as a contri-bution to the trade balance. So far as exports from the United Kingdom areconcerned, there will be no difficulty in providing space for the production likelyto be available.[30414] ----- ---- ----  &quot;  -   93Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1945.
The proviso is that we are able to retain under the British flag about-1 million gross tons of shipping. Of this total about -7 million gross tons is represented by Canadian dry cargo ships which are chartered to us by Canadafor. the duration of hostilities only, and I am assuming that this aid will not be withdrawn or have to be remunerated in Canadian dollars for the time being.- &apos; The remainder, amounting to 1-9 million gross tons including - 5 tonsconstructed in Canada has hitherto been lent to us by the United States on Lease-Lend terms. It consists mainly of ocean-going dry cargo ships. We cannot afford to dispense with this addition to our tonnage resources in the near future and thetermination of Lease-Lend confronts us with a formidable problem. These ships are at present chartered to us for a period not extending beyond six months afterthe cessation of hostilities and are subject to whatever financial arrangements mayprevail between the two countries for the time being. The vessels are on bare boatcharter and are therefore manned and operated by ourselves, and the basis of anycharter hire that might be fixed or agreed would therefore only have to covercapital charges (interest and depreciation) and risk of loss. As our own new construction proceeds, we may be able to afford to surrender these ships, treatingthem as in effect part of the permanent surplus of war-built ships for which ona long term view no suitable employment can be found. Our best course, therefore,will be to attempt to negotiate with the United States an extension of thesecharters on reasonable terms for a comparatively short period.It would not be necessary or even reasonable to seek to limit these charters to do  short a term as six months and I should be prepared to settle on a period ofthree years with an option, if it could be secured, to return a proportion of thevessels at an earlier date. It must, however, be recognised that such a proposalmay not be acceptable to the United States and that we may be forced to accepta longer period of charter. An arrangement of this kind will involve us in thepayment of dollars for hire, but the dollar burden would not be out of proportion to the value of the services we should derive from the use of the ships.It is, of course, possible that the United States will refuse to charter, or evenplead that they have no power to charter to us, and they may press us to acquirethese vessels or such proportion of them as we need. To purchase the ships forcash would involve a formidable dollar obligation; would increase the proportionof our fleet which is not best adapted to future trading requirements, and mightadversely affect the willingness of British owners to order further tonnage in ourown yards. I think, therefore, that we should do our utmost to obtain anextension of the charter terms and reconsider the position if this provesimpossible.In order to reduce our dependence upon the United States for assistance in tonnage, we must clearly make all possible use of the German shipping falling toour share.Disposal and redistribution of surplus tonnage.The dominant feature of the whole shipping situation is the inevitable andenormous surplus of wartime shipping constructed in the United States, for whichthere is no possibility of employment. This surplus, which is already beginning to emerge, is limited to the large ocean carrying type of dry cargo ship and to largetankers. In other classes of tonnage there will be deficiencies, more or less serious and more or less capable of being bridged by make-shift and temporary arrange-ments. There is only one way of dealing with this surplus, which will otherwisehang over the freight market and paralyse the shipyards, and that is to scrap orlay up a very large proportion of it, not less than 2,000 ships and perhaps a good many more. The United States realise that this will have to be done and that itis their problem, but they have recently suggested that British and other maritimeAllies should agree to lay up some of their own older tonnage. Indeed, they suggested originally that all countries should lay up the same proportion of their pre-war fleet. The Ministry of War Transport have taken the firm line that sucha proposal is completely unacceptable and indeed impossible for us, and I proposeto continue to take that line. We cannot afford to increase our net dollar commit-ments by laying up any of our tonnage which can be kept in service, and this position must govern our action over the next few months. Moreover, it must beremembered that practically all the old or obsolescent British tonnage is privately owned. Apart from our financial difficulties, we could not put our seamen outof employment by laying up useful ships. On the contrary, our aim must be toincrease the amount of employment at sea, since large numbers of officers andseamen will be coming back from naval service and this release of seamen will
only be partially offset by temporary recruits to the Merchant Navy returning toshore employment.All this does not necessarily mean that we may not be able to dispose of acertain quantity of inefficient tonnage as part of the framework of a satisfactorylong-term policy which opened up prospects of our being able to employ profitablya large mercantile marine. Subject to our overriding interests, we are bound todiscuss their problem sympathetically with the United States, although we mustregard it as mainly their liability. It is, of course, impossible at present to assessaccurately the actual demand for cargo and tanker tonnage in the immediate post-war years, and any scheme for disposing of a large block of the war shipping resources must provide sufficient flexibility to ensure adjustment of tonnage fromtime to time, and must not so heavily restrict the amount of tonnage readily available as to create an artificial shortage of shipping.Since the world&apos;s tonnage is maldistributed by flag, the problem of disposing of the surplus cannot be disassociated from the problem of redistribution. Apartfrom our temporary need for the use of a substantial block of tonnage until ourown building can make good our own deficiencies, some of the other countries alsoare in receipt of temporary assistance from the United States, and all flags include a substantial (though differing) proportion of old or obsolete tonnage. Even theAmerican fleet includes a substantial amount of tonnage over twenty years old.A further principle by which our policy must be guided is that no scheme could be acceptable to this country which limited our plans for building up ourmerchant fleet at least to its pre-war level, and as much beyond that level as can beprofitably employed. We cannot afford to approach the problem of adjustingthe world&apos;s surplus of war-time ships by undertaking any commitment as to thetotal amount of tonnage to be maintained at any given time under the british flag, and it follows that we should not propose any such limitations upon othercountries.To sum up, the United States attitude is likely to be that they will be willingto lay up a large tonnage, and to distribute part of their surplus to other flagsupon terms. If they ask us to lay up a proportion of our own fleet, we mustdecline, for the reasons which I have explained, any proposal which imposes on usany reduction in the total tonnage we can keep at sea. They will also insist on maintaining in active employment a Merchant Marine larger than pre-war, and seek conditions in which they can expect to trade it. On our side we must avoid any commitment guaranteeing to the United States a particular share of theworld&apos;s tonnage, or the world&apos;s carrying trade or of particular trades. On theother hand, we ought not, of course, to seek to challenge their right to maintain and employ a Mercantile Marine of such size as they think fit, but we shouldmake it clear that we expect them to abide by the results of fair competition.In speaking of surplus, I have referred expressly to the United States ships.Any scheme for disposing of the wartime surplus should also embrace the Canadianconstruction.Future of the United Maritime Authority.The next urgent problem is to determine our attitude in regard to the united maritime Authority, upon whose existence our current shipping policy is based.All ships under the control of the constructing governments, irrespective of flag,are allocated by the United Maritime Executive Board to meet requirementssubmitted and sponsored by Governments claiming on the pool of shipping.Rates of freight are determined by the Board for all ships allocated from the pool,and these rates apply uniformly irrespective of flag.The objects of UM.A. were to ensure that United Nations shipping was devoted first and foremost to the essential military and other requirements of the contracting countries and liberated areas and to provide for an orderly transitionin due course to more normal conditions of commerce. The Agreement on principles establishing the Authority remains in force for six months after the cessation of hostilities in the Far East, i.e., until February 1946. unless determinedearlier by mutual agreement of the United States, United Kingdom, Norway,Holland and France.At first sight, the conditions of surplus of tonnage which is now developingwould appear to make the continuance of the Authority unnecessary, so faras its first object is concerned. When tonnage is surplus to requirements, thereshould be no great difficulty in the way of any Government obtaining the tonnageit required on reasonable terms. In effect, however, as I have already explained,the present tonnage resources of the United Kingdom, unaugmented, are not
adequate to meet our requirements, which include not only our import programme and the military maintenance and other programmes, but also the requirements of territories normally looking to us for a large proportion of their shipping. we also have to consider the interests of British shipping in other trades. similarly the European Allies as a group are short of. snipping. Through U.MA. theUnited States is bound to give shipping help to the contracting Governments whereit is required.The U.M.A. Agreement is thus a protection against conditions which theUnited States shipping authorities might otherwise impose upon shipping aid,and if we were to take the lead in bringing U.M.A. to an end, the United StatesGovernment might claim to conduct their shipping policy thereafter in a mannerlikely to serve United States interests alone. On all grounds it would be most unwise for us to challenge, as we could not do successfully, the United Statesmerchant fleet in open competition with the shipping resources at present availableto us.The Agreement on Principle does not solve our shipping problems but itdoes give us temporary protection and a breathing space for recuperation and negotiation.There are other reasons for the continuation of U.M.A. Among them, 1mention first the shortage of passenger ships which will continue long afterFebruary 1946 and makes necessary some concerted arrangements for poolingpassenger tonnage, and, next, the importance of making progress in re-establishing the pre-war shipping negotiations on a basis of fair participation, which willbe achieved most satisfactorily under the aegis of the Authority.So far as we know, none of the contracting governments is likely to propose the determination of the U.M.A. agreement before its automatic expiration inFebruary next. The United States would be likely to resist any such proposal and I think that it would be a mistake for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take any initiative tewards bringing the Authority to an earlier end. I propose, therefore,not myself to raise this question and, if it is raised by any other Government, to favour continuance for the full term of the Agreement. Within the terms of theAgreement it will be possible to simplify procedures and I should support anypracticable action with this object.A more difficult question is whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should take any initiative in proposing the prolongation of U.M.A. after the period atpresent agreed for its operation, or in suggesting for a transitional period somemodified form of international co-operation in shipping between Governments.I may shortly be better able to gauge the opinion of other Governments on thispoint and meanwhile shall reserve my own viewTs as to the course which we oughtto take.  My representatives will be non-committal.There are a number of questions related to our control over our ownshipping and the expiration of existing charters which I will submit to mycolleagues in a separate memorandum in due course.A. B.Ministry of War Transport, W. 1,29th August, 1945.
