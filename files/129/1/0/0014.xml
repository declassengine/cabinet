Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 114.lbth August, 1945.CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE MUNITIONS INDUSTRIES.Report by the President of the Board of Trade.IN accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet I have examined withthe Joint War Production Staff the &quot;situation in the munitions industriesresulting from the end *of the Japanese war. Immediate steps have been takenby the Service and Supply Departments to examine their programmes and toprepare the ground for drastic and immediate cuts. Some time will be requiredto prepare accurate figures and to assess the final level at which programmes willbe stabilised to cover the needs of the next year or so. Our military commit-ments have first to be examined by the Chiefs of Staff in the light of the new situation, and thereafter revised calculations of munitions requirements willhave to be made. It is hoped that by the end of September it will be possibleto indicate with reasonable firmness the picture up to the end of June 1946.In the meantime, the following estimates have been made of the releases to beexpected over the eight weeks following the Japanese surrender.A dmiralty.2. Apart from transfers from naval to merchant shipbuilding, whichcannot yet be assessed, the Admiralty expect to release 55,000 men and women in the period.Ministry of Supply.3. The Ministry of Supply expect to reduce their man-power by 600,000in the eight weeks from the present total of 1,100,000 down to 500,000.Ministry of Aircraft Production.4. The Ministry of Aircraft Production expect to reduce their total by500,000 from the present total of 1,100,000 down to 600,000.5. Thus a total of about 1,155,000 men and women will be released from the munitions industries in the eight weeks following the Japanese surrender.Releases will be small in the first week, but thereafter they should be fairly evenlyspaced throughout the period. There will, of course, be further releases there-after, the total and rate of which cannot yet be stated with any accuracy.6. Certain problems which arise in connection with these releases have beenconsidered, and are being dealt with as shown below.Advice to contractors.7. It has been arranged that the following statement shall be issued throughthe B.B.C. and the Press at the first convenient opportunity after the officialsurrender of Japan is announced : *&quot; An immediate review of war contracts is being made by the Depart-ments concerned. Main contractors whose programmes will be cancelled or reduced will shortly receive instructions from the Departments for whichthey are now working, and they should pass these instructions on to theirsub-contractors in the normal way. Until these instructions are received,work on existing contracts should continue and managements are asked to refrain wherever possible from making special enquiries.&quot;[39363]
Method of terminating contracts.&apos;8. The guillotine will be applied to a large number of contracts for storesfor the army and for certain stores such as bombs for the R.A.F. The majorityof Ministry of Aircraft Production contracts will be terminated by the means ofthe break clause in these contracts. The methods to be adopted in dealing withcontracts are being discussed with representatives of industry and the T.U.C.through the machinery of the Joint Consultative Committee.Unemployment.9. The Minister of Labour does not expect that these releases will result inwidespread unemployment. The figures include large numbers of over-ageworkers and&apos;of women who will not wish to stay in industry. Furthermore aconsiderable number of the men and women wmo will be released from the forces during this period will still be on leave. He therefore expects that most of thepeople released by the munitions industries and seeking fresh employment willbe readily absorbed.Raw Materials.10. Every effort will be made to secure the maximum diversion of scarceraw materials from military to civil uses. Service Departments are arrangingto freeze stocks of such materials and to review the position with the object of declaring surpluses. The Board of Trade are consulting with the supply departments with a view to expediting the repossession and reallocation of stocksof scarce materials in the hands of contractors.11, A difficult problem is presented by the great amount of semi-manufactured and other stocks which are at present occupying a very large amount of factory space which is used for storage purposes. The urgent necessityfor clearing factory space and for arranging for the transport and storage ofmaterial of all kinds has been referred to the Ministerial Storage Committee,who are setting up an Official Committee to study the problem and to advise onthe action to be taken. In the meanwhile the Board of Trade will be in touchwith the Supply Ministries in regard to the acceleration of the declaration ofsurpluses of semi-manufactured material, and the solution of related problems.12. There will be considerable difficulty in reconciling conflicting needs. Onthe one hand there is the urgent necessity for clearing away a large mass of surplus material so as to free the industrial machine for civilian production; onthe other hand it is clearly desirable that disposal of valuable material should proceed without undue loss. Departments will use every effort to effect thisreconciliation, but it is probable that a certain amount of economy will have to be sacrificed in the interests of the rapid restarting of civil industry.P. S. C.Board of Trade, S.W.1,15th August, 1945.
