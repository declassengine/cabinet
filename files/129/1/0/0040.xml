13 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HI8 BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)I 1863 E C Rc.p. (us) i4g *1ST SEPTEMBER,   1 9U5 COPY NO.   gCABINETRAISING THE SCHOOL LEAVING AGEMemorandum by the Lord Presidentof the CouncilIn accordance with the decision of the Cabinet at its meeting on the 23rd August (C. M. (1+5)  25th Conclusions,minute 3) I have examined the practical implications of adecision to raise  the school leaving age to 15 on1st April, 19^7 in conjunction with the Lord Privy Seal,the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministers ofLabour and National Service, Education, Health and Works.The following I think accurately represents our conclusions.2. 7e are satisfied that the raising of the leaving agewill be generally regarded as a test of the Government&apos;ssincerity and that for political reasons we must stick tothe date provided for in the Education Act,  if-it ishumanly possible to do so.3. The practical problems involved are twofold:-(i) Can the available accommodation in schools be expanded in time to house the increased numberof children without an unbearable strain onthe building resources available for otherparts of the Government&apos;s programme?(ii) Assuming that the answer to (i)  is in the affirmative will there be a. sufficient number of trained teachers available?I.    ACCOMMODATION4. We are satisfied that, given the standards of construction- which the Education Departments are preparedto accept, the necessary accommodation can be madeavailable in time without undue strain on our building resources.      The amount of labour required is proportionatesmall (being roughly 15,000 men in the tv/o years August191+.6 to August 191+8 for this and other parts of the educational programme) ;    and while there may be&apos; some difficulty in providing certain materials, such asasbestos sheeting, we think and hope that these can be surmounted.5.      -   We would,  however,  emphasise that if the educational and other local authority building programmes are not tobe thwarted by lack of organisation,  it is essential that not a moment should be lost in extracting skilled technical staff from the Services.

II.     TEACHING STAFF ,        18?6, Hero the position is more difficult.      The regulations of the Ministry of Education lay down,  as the target to be aimed at,  that the number of children on a class roll shouldnot exceed 30 for seniors or br0 for juniors..     We are stillfar from achieving this ideal and the raising of the leaving age in April 1947 will postpone any hope of achieving it for a long time to come.      But we think that the continuanceof overlarge classes must be accepted as the lesser evil.7. The other doubtful factor- in the problem is the: degree to which the teaching profession will be affected bythe retirement of married women and over-age teachjsrs now that the war is ended.      The Educational Ministers are reasonably confident that the output of teachers under theEmergency Training Scheme will be sufficient for theadditional number of children once the age has been raised.But this output will leave no margin to replace anyabnormal wastage in the existing number of teachers and ifthis wastage reached serious proportions,  the lack of teachers might leave us no alternative but to postpone thedate,8. As far as England, and Wales are concerned we are&apos;informed that a special enquiry carried out by the Ministryof Education in November,  1914-4 showed that there areapproximately 45-000 teachers who are either married womenor who are over the age of 60 but there are-no reliablestatistics to show how many of these teachers wish to retirein the near future.The Cabinet will remember that when the subject was last discussed it was suggested that the abnormal wastagein England and Wales might be as high as 25,000 over thenext four years.      Since this figure was given,  information has corns to light which suggests that it was unduly-pessimistic and that a considerable proportion of marriedwomen and teachers over 60 will continue in the schools forseveral    years to come.9. When account is also  taken of the fact that theMinister of Education intends to make a strong appeal to allteachers to stay on for as long as possible in order tofacilitate the early raising of the leaving age, and thatthere is a financial inducement to the older teachers toremain in the Service for long enough for the full benefitof the recently increased salary scales to be reflected intheir pensions, we do not think that the abnormal wastagewill amount to more than 10,000 at the most.      If it reachesthis figure it will represent rather over 5 per cent,  of thetotal body of the teaching profession and, while such ashortage will undoubtedly detract from the standard ofeducation, we do not thini;; that it is sufficient to justifythe Government postponing further the date for increasing theleaving age.10.        The Secretary of State for Scotland for his part,  is satisfied that the number of teachers likely to be availablein Scotland ought to be sufficient to justify theGovernment in sticking to 1st April,  1947.11.        To sum up,  it must be recognised (and we consider thatthe public should so be warned at an early date)  that if weare to raise the leaving age in April 1947 we must beprepared for a time to accept very imperfect conditions.Accommodation will be temporary and makeshift and classes&apos;   will be larger than could be desired.      In spite of these-   defects, however, we are satisfied that the step can andshould be taken.H.M.Council Offi ce , S. W. 1. ,September n  1045......   .
