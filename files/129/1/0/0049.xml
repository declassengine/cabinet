DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 149.10th September, 1945TRADE DISPUTES AND TRADE UNIONS ACT REPEAL BILL.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.I think that I should inform the Cabinet of the arrangements that have beenmade with regard to the contents of the Bill to repeal the Trades Disputes andTrade Unions Act, 1927, and as to the date of its introduction.2. Contents of the Bill.-The Bill is a simple and straightforward repeal of the Act of 1927, leaving the law, therefore, in exactly the same place as it was before the Act of 1927 was passed. This was the Bill which I was authorised bythe Cabinet in 1930 to bring in and it was only abandoned for the more complexBill we did in fact bring in, because the Liberal Party would not agree to supportthe Bill in this form. I feel quite satisfied in my own mind that straightforwardrepeal is much the best solution because we shall get into far greater difficultiesif we try to prepare a new Bill on the lines of the Bill of 1930. When the cabinet considered the Legislative Programme at their meeting on the 7th August(CM. (45) 18th Conclusions, Minute 5, sub-paragraph (k) ) their general view wasin favour of complete repeal of the Act of 1927.The Bill will contain certain transitional provisions which are necessary byreason of the lapse of time since the passage of the 1927 Act. I propose that itshould be for .the Executive Committee of the Union to approve the form of thenew Rules that would be required subject to the approval of the Registrar. Iwould point out that on the passage of this Bill contracting out as opposed &quot;tocontracting in automatically becomes the law, and the only point for the ExecutiveCommittee to consider is the precise form of Rules which will follow upon this change. The Registrar will have model rules and departure from these modelrules is only allowed within narrow limits. It therefore does not seem worthwhile to put the Unions to the trouble and expense of summoning special GeneralMeetings. Any decision which the Executive Committee make can be reviewed and, if necessary, varied by the general meeting of the Union whenever it issummoned.3. Date of Introduction of the Bill. It has been provisionally agreed bythe Legislation Committee that this Bill should be introduced very early in the session, but as the passage of the Bill will no doubt give rise to considerable political controversy I think that this decision should be formally brought tothe notice of the Cabinet.4. Responsibility for the Bill. The main responsibility for the Bill in theHouse of Commons will undoubtedly rest with the Attorney-General. It willprobably be thought desirable that some Minister of Cabinet rank in the Houseof Commons should be in general charge of the Bill in that House. There is alsothe question as to whether there should not be some sponsoring Department.When I was Attorney-General in the last Labour Government I had noDepartment to assist me and was left completely to my own resources. It mightbe well on this occasion to entrust some Department, whether the Home Office orthe Ministry of Labour, with the duty of preparing briefs and getting the factstogether for the use of the Attorney-General in the House of Commons.J.House of Lords, S.W. 1,10th September, 1945.Copy No.CABINET.[30466]
