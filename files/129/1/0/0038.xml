PROLOGUE    .To Colonel the Right Honourable Oliver Stanley, M.C., M.P., Secretaryoi State for the Colonies.Sir,i. You announced in the House of Commons on 5th July, 1944, the decisionof His Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint a Commission to visit Ceylon inconnection with the reform of the Constitution; and on 20th September thefollowing terms of reference were made public:  To visit Ceylon in order to examine and discuss any proposals for constitutional reform in the Island which have the object of giving effect tothe Declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government on that subject dated 26thMay, 1943;* and, after consultation with various interests in the Island,including minority communities, concerned with the subject of constitutional reform, to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on all measures necessaryto attain that object.&quot;2. The Commission first met in London on 30th November, 1944. and aseries of preliminary meetings followed at which, after examination of the basic documents, we were able to discuss the procedure we proposed to adopt.We also took the opportunity of holding various informal discussions with officials of the Colonial Office and the Treasury concerned with our mission.3. We left England by R.A.F. Transport Command aircraft on 19thDecember and arrived in Colombo on the 22nd December. By means of advertisements in the newspapers, we then invited the public to submit pro-posals designed to give effect to the Declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof .26th May, 1943,* and to send in criticisms of any such proposals as hadbeen or might be made public.January 15th, 1945, was fixed as the closing date for the submission of memoranda containing proposals, and 165 were received in all. Between22nd January and 15th March, 20 Public Sessions were held in the Town Hall,Colombo, at which the writers of representative memoranda were invitedto elaborate and discuss their proposals orally. In all, 80 deputations and individual witntsses were examined in this way, and representatives of almost all important shades of opinion were heard. A verbatim record of the evidencetaken is available both in London and Ceylon. A list of witnesses heard in public and Private Sessions appears in Appendix II.4. Before our arrival in Ceylon the scheme entitled &quot; The ConstitutionalScheme formulated by the Ministers in accordance with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs Declaration of 26th May, 1943 &quot; and set forth in Ceylon SessionalPaper XIV dated September, 1944,! had already been placed before the public.On 22nd January, 1945, while Public Sessions were proceeding, the Com-mission published in the Press the only other complete &quot;Constitutional Schemereceived&apos; that of the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress and invited criticisms ofit; and on 10th and 12th February a summary of the remaining proposals was similarly published, criticisms also being invited.5. Wc left Ceylon, again by Transport Command aircraft, on 7th april and landed in England on 9th April.* See para. 83.f This Sessional Paper is reproduced in full as Appendix I and will be referred to as&quot; S.P. XIV &quot; throughout this Report.
6. At various periods during our stay we were afforded opportunities to travel throughout the Island and acquaint ourselves with the life of its people. *Either together or individually we visited all nine Provinces and saw for our-selves the remarkable diversity of conditions to which the wide variation of physical features and climate gives rise. We visited both coastal and inlandtowns and villages, inspected village industries and factories, and gainedsome first-hand knowledge of all stages of tea, rubber, copra and plumbagoproduction on which, with the growdng of food crops, the Island&apos;s economy is founded. The many major and minor irrigation works now under con-struction or restoration, and the surrounding land colonisation schemes withtheir agricultural, experimental and training centres, proved of particular interest. We were given facilities to inspect schools of different types and teachers&apos; training colleges, and to visit hospitals, maternity and welfare centres and dispensaries, in both towns and villages. We had the good fortune to seemany of the ancient monuments and historic temples to be found in all partsof the Island, including the &quot; buried cities &quot; of Anuradhapura and Polon-naruwa. Throughout these visits and inspections, all classes of the com-munity received us with marked courtesy and kindness, and everywhere wewere overwhelmed with hospitality. Our thanks axe due to the ministers and Members of the State Council concerned and to the many private indi-viduals whose ready co-operation made it possible for us in so short a timeto see and experience so much.7. In explanation of certain apparent omissions from the list of witnesses,we should perhaps refer briefly to certain factors affecting the political situa-tion in Ceylon at the time of our arrival and during our stay. The Constifu-tional Scheme set out in S.P.XIV, which had been prepared by the CeylonMinisters and submitted to you, had been withdrawn by them on 18th August,1944. Nevertheless, you had made it clear that the Commission could regard it as one of the Schemes to be considered. In this situation none of theMinisters submitted memoranda to us or appeared before us in Public Session,though, as will be seen from the list of witnesses at Appendix II, the Hon.Mr. D. S. Senanayake, Minister for Agriculture and Lands, Vice-Chairman ofthe Board of Ministers and Leader of the State Council, had an opportunityof expressing his views to us in a series of most valuable private sittings.8. Moreover, before our arrival, a number of Members of the State Council,including certain Ministers, had declared their intention of continuing to press for full Dominion status and of non-co-operation with the Commission. this being so, these gentlemen did not appear before us. Their views, however,became well known to us through the Press and other channels, and not least through die Debate held in the State Council during our stay, on the ceylon (Constitution) Bill, a measure designed to confer immediate dominion status which passed its third reading on 22nd March, 1945. We feel boundto record our regret, however, that we should thus have had no opportunityof discussion with representatives of a section of public opinion whose contribu-tion to our understanding of the present stage of political development, in ceylon might have proved useful* A detailed itinerary will be found in Appendix III.
CHAPTER ITHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDg. A ibrief reference to the history of Ceylon is necessary in order toexplain how its problems, racial, religious and social, arose.* Since thedawn of history, the Island has been subjected to invasions and, for a variety of reasons, the successive waves of invaders who settled there andhecame the ancestors of the present population have never been completelyfused into a united and homogeneous people. The main source of theseinvaders was naturally India, and it was thence that, according to tradition,the Sinhalese, who are the majority community, came in the sixth century B.C.When their age-long struggle began with the Tamils, the principal minority community, who also came from India, is obscure. In the course of it, con-siderable blending of the two races undoubtedly took place, but the factthat the Sinhalese adopted Buddhism, while the Tamils remained Hindus,tended to maintain the distinction. The predominance of the Tamils in theextreme North, where they were able to maintain close contact with their fellow Dravidians in India, while the Aryan Sinhalese in Southern Ceylonwere permanently cut off from their original home in North India, alsohelped each to preserve their separate traditions, and the two languages sur-vived. The Sinhalese, who number to-day about four millions, and the ceylon Tamils, of whom there are nearly 700,000, are. thus the descendantsof the early settlers in the Island.10. The first Mohammedans to establish themselves in Ceylon were theArabs, who came as traders from the Shores of the Persian Gulf in the eighthcentury A.D. They originally settled near the coast and only graduallyextended their activities inland. By the fifteenth centmy they had won for themselves a position of considerable importance. Their religion guaranteedtheir survival as a distinct community and the Moors, as they came to becalled, now number nearly 400,000. They are widely distributed throughoutthe Island with several quite considerable concentrations.11. The first Europeans to settle in Ceylon were the Portuguese, who cameprincipally in search of spices, and sought to profit from the great achieve-rnent of ,their navigators by monopolising the trade between Europe andthe cast. From 1505 onwards, they gradually acquired control of the WesternMaritime Provinces, and in 1619 also established themselves in the north.Animated by crusading zeal, they succeeded in converting large numbers ofthe inhabitants to Christianity, and the chief permanent consequence of thePortuguese occupation is the existence of the large Roman Catholic com-mun:Ly of about 480,000, mainly, though by no means exclusively, Sinhalese.12. Meanwhile, the Dutch had succeeded in establishing themselves in theMoluccas^ They were engaged in a struggle with Spain for their independence in Europe, and when Spain and Portugal had been united under Philip II,they naturally felt free to attack the latter&apos;s Eastern settlements.

A brief reference to the history of Ceylon is necessary in order toexplain how its problems, racial, religious and social, arose.* Since thedawn of history, the Island has been subjected to invasions and, for a variety of reasons, the successive waves of invaders who settled there and became ,the ancestors of the present population have never been completelyfused into a united and homogeneous people.. The main source of theseinvaders was naturally India, and it was thence that, according to tradition,the Sinhalese, who- are the majority community, came in the sixth century B.C.When their age-long struggle began with the Tamils, the principal minority community, who also came from India, is obscure. In the course of it, con-si considerable   blending of the two races undoubtedly took place, but the factthat the Sinhalese adopted Buddhism, while the Tamils remained Hindus,tended to maintain the distinction. The predominance of the Tamils in theextreme North, where they were able to maintain close contact with their fellow Dravidians in India, while the.-Aryan Sinhalese in Southern Ceylonwere permanently cut off from their original home in North India, alsohelped each to preserve their separate traditions, and the two languages sur-vived. The Sinhalese, who number to-day about four millions, and the ceylon Tamils, of whom there are nearly 700,000, are thus the descendantsof the early settlers in the Island.10. The first Mohammedans to establish themselves in Ceylon were theArabs, who came as traders from the shores of the Persian Gulf in the eighth -century A.D. They originally settled near the coast and only graduallyextended their activities inland.&apos; By the fifteenth century they had won for themselves a position of considerable importance. Their religion guaranteedtheir survival as a distinct community and the Moors, as they came to becalled, now number nearly 400,000. They are widely distributed throughoutthe Island with several quite considerable concentrations.11. The first Europeans to settle in Ceylon were the Portuguese, who cameprincipally in search of spices, and sought to- profit from the great achieve-rnent of ,their navigators by monopolising the trade between Europe andthe east. From 1505 onwards, they gradually acquired control of the WesternMaritime Provinces, and in 1619 also established themselves in the north.Animated by crusading zeal, they succeeded in converting large numbers ofthe inhabitants to Christianity, and the chief permanent consequence of thePortuguese occupation is the existence of the large Roman Catholic com-mun!y of about 480,000, mainly, though by no means exclusively, Sinhalese.12. Meanwhile, the Dutch had succeeded in establishing themselves in theMoluccas. They were engaged in a struggle with Spain for their independence in Europe, and when Spain and Portugal had been united under Philip II,they naturally felt free to attack the latter&apos;s Eastern settlements. Colombowas captured in 1656 and Jaffna two years later.    The Dutch, like the
Portuguese, confined their attention to the Maritime Provinces, where theirEast India Company built warehouses and forts to organise and protect their trade. Ceylon owes to the Dutch occupation her Roman-Dutch law and theBurgher community, now about&apos;.30,000 strong, which has played, and stillplays, a significant part in the public and professional life of the Island. Itwas during the Dutch period also that the Malays were introduced as soldiers.Though racially quite distinct from the Moors, they are Mohammedans inreligion and add about 18,000 to the total Muslim population.13. Just as the union of Spain and Portugal exposed Ceylon&quot;,to the attacksof the Dutch, so the overrunning of Holland by the French Revolutionaryforces, with whom Great Britain was at war, led the British to invade the island, in order ,to deny to the French Navy the fine natural harbour otTrincomalee, and to obtain the use of a naval base from which to operate in the Bay of Bengal. The Dutch Governor surrendered Colombo and ahDutch territory in Ceylon in 1796, and under the terms of &quot;the Peace ofAmiens in 1802, Great Britain retained it as a British possession. It was thus that Ceylon became a crown Colony. With the cession of the Kandyanor inland provinces to the British Crown in 1815, the Island may be said tohave been united politically, and by 1833 it had been provided with a com-plete administrative system.14. The Kandyan inhabitants of the interior had not experienced theconsequences of Portuguese and Dutch occupation, and the inevitabledifferences between upland and lowland peoples had thus been accentuated.This distinction between Kandj^an and Low Country Sinhalese has beeninsensibly blurred in the course of the last hundred years; but it has notyet completely disappeared. Of the four million Sinhalese, roughly one-thirdmay be said to be Kandyan.15. The economic development of the Island under British initiative addedfurther elements to the complex of communities. Indentured labour wasimported from India to build roads and clear land for the establishment ofplantations, where first coffee, and later and more extensively tea, was grown.These Indian labourers, mainly Tamils, to-day number between six- and sevenhundred thousand; that is, rather less than the long-established Ceylon Tamils^to whom reference has already been made.. Other Indians, merchants anapetty traders, have settled widely in the Island, and communities, such asthe Malayalis, are found in the towns employed in skilled trades and domestic service. There are about 10,000 Europeans mainly engaged in the manage-ment of the up-country plantations or in the financial and conunercdal businessof the Port of Colombo.16. The last decennial census was taken on 26th February, 1931, but its-scope was limited owing to the financial crisis of that year. At this census,Ceylon had (inclusive of military and shipping personnel) a total populationof 5,312,548, which was 17.9 per cent, more than in 1921. Statistics of raceswere not collected in 1931, except in the Colombo Municipality and on theplantations or estates as they are now called but on the basis of the incom-plete census of 1931, and allowing for the increase of population since then,the chief constituents of the population of to-day may be roughly estimated as follows t :  * Throughout this Report we shall use the terms &quot; Ceylon Tamils&quot; and &quot;IndianTamils &quot; to distinguish between the two communities.I For a more detailed analysis of the population figures see Appendix IV.

The caste system is present in Ceylon, but is fortunately far lessextensive and rigid than in India. There are a number of castes among theSinhalese, but the distinctions between them are gradually becoming blurred.This does not yet appear to be the case among the Tamils in the Northern and eastern provinces, where there is a depressed class estimated to amount toabout 100,000 persons.18. The relative permanence of the strata of society laid down in thecourse of Ceylon&apos;s history may be ascribed to three main causes location,religion and occupation. Location divides the Ceylon Tamils of the NorthernProvince from, the Sinhalese; religion sharply distinguishes between the Sin-halese, the Tamils, both Ceylon and Indian, and the Muslims; while occupationseparates the. Indian Tamils on the plantations from the typical small culti-cultivators, whether Sinhalese or- Ceylon Tamil. To these differences, which neednot in themselves have led to friction in a static community, have been appliedthe dynamic Western conceptions of nationalism and democracy, . whilchnaturally tend to break up a stratified society. Nationalism, if it is to be aunifying force, requires the elimination of communalism from political life.It is also intolerant of external restraint. Democracy in which &quot; each shallcount for one and not for more than one &quot; demands for its free operation a wider tolerance, in religion, an understanding of the conflicting claims of raceand language and a willingness to compromise on major political issues after full and free discussion.CHAPTER IICONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT UP TO THE BONOUGHMORECONSTITUTION OF 1931tq. Afer the Dutch maritime settlements in Ceylon were surrendered tothe British in 1796, they were administered by the East India Company aspart of the Madras Presidency until 1802, when, as we have already men-tioned. Great Britain gained permanent possession of the Island by the terms
of the Peace of Amiens, and made it a Crown Colony. Under the Constitu-tion then introduced, the Governor, answerable only to the Secretary of Stateand, through him, to the British Parliament, enjoyed extensive powers,administrative, legislative and judicial. He could seel: the advice of his council, consisting of the Chie^ Justice, the Commander-in-Chief and theChief Secretary, but was under no obligation to accept it. After the cession of the Kandyan Provinces and their subsequent revolt and settlement,they were administered separately through officials appointed by and respon-sible only to the Governor.20. In 1823 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the adminis-tration of the Island. In their instructions were included, inter alia, an enquiry into the powers exercised by the Governor, the effectiveness of theCouncil and the condition of revenue and expenditure. The main burdenof the investigation fell on the shoulders of Lieutenant-Colonel W. M. G.Golebrooke, who proved indefatigable in visiting all parts of the island and collecting a great quantity of valuable information. He had very definiteviews on matters of principle, based, consciously or unconsciously, on theteachings of Adam Smith and Jeremy Bent-ham. 4 The obligation on theinhabitants to perform customary service (rajakariya) seemed to him objection-able because it tended to stereotype methods of cultivation and to preventmobility of labour; and the Government monopolies, particularly incinnamon, hindered the proper growth of private enterprise in trade. Forthese reasons he did not hesitate to recommend the abolition of customaryservice and monopolies. He found that the Governors powers were prac-tically unlimited, a state of affairs he strongly condemned. Nor could heapprove of the differences in the administration of the Maritime and KandyanProvinces.21. Colebrooke&apos;s principles, fully applied, would have resulted in a strictlyconstitutional Governor obliged to consult his executive officers, and a Legis-lature based on some form of representation. He pressed them so far asthe circumstances of the time allowed. Unification of the administrationthroughout the Island would have removed the special powers exercised bythe Governor in the Kandyan Provinces, and a Council of seven was to share with the Governor executive responsibility. The creation of a Legis-lature presented a serious problem in a country where, as he recognised,&quot; the people are unprepared for popular institutions.&quot; Accordingly, he recommonded the formation of a Legislative Council which would, he thought,form an essential part of any Legislature for which the -Island might befitted at some future date.22. By an Order in Council of 28th September, 1833, the recommendations made by Colebrooke were in the main enforced. The Executive council was to consist of five members under the chairmanship of the Governor the Commander of the Forces, the Colonial Secretary, the.Queen&apos;s Advocate,the Colonial Treasurer and the Government Agent for the Central Province.The Governor, however, retained the right to disregard the expressed views,of the Council, provided that he furnished the Secretary of State with afull report of the matter at issue. The Legislative Council was to containnine Official and six Unofficial Members, the Unofficials to be nominated&quot;as far as possible in equal proportions from the respectable European mer-chants or inhabitants and the higher classes of natives.&quot; The new council was constituted on 1st October, 1833. After some initial difficulties,Unofficial Members were eventually nominated, including a Sinhalese, aTamil and a Burgher. A beginning was thus made jn constitutional govern-ment in which the Ceylonese had a share.
o        .       .    10723. The fundamental principles of the Constitution of 1833 survived until1910. During this long and important period in the history of Ceylon, itwas naturally severely criticised on frequent occasions and reforms weredemanded. The Official majority in the Legislative Council, the principleof nomination rather than election, the meagre representation accorded tothe Ceylonese, and the absence of all control over the Executive Council,especially in the matter of finance, were obvious points for attack. Smallconcessions were made from time to time; but the demand for representative government was always resisted by the Colonial Office on the ground thatany system of suffrage which could be justified would give power to the europeans and Burghers to the disadvantage of the great majority ofCeylonese. In judging the sincerity of this objection, it must be rememberedthat the right to vote in Great Britain was very much restricted even afterthe Reform Act of 1832. The most insistent demand was for a majorityof Unofficials in the Legislative Council. This was particularly strong in times of depression when the Government reduced expenditure and thuscurtailed the outlay on the construction of roads, as at the time of theeconomic crisis of 1847, and it came to a head again in 1865 over the questionof the contribution towards the military establishment. The Europeans andBurghers then founded the Ceylon League to press for an Unofficial majority.24. It was not until 1889 that the number of Unofficial Members of theLegislative Council was increased to eight, by the addition of two to repre-sent the Kandyans and the Muslims, They were now eight in all a Tamil,a-Low Country Sinhalese, a Kandyan Sinhalese, a Muslim, a Burgher andthree Europeans. The official majority was reduced to one. But two new and powerful factors were now beginning to operate. As the century woreon, the whole conception of the function of government was changing andthere was a growing presumption in favour of a more active intervention in economic development and social reform. The emergence of an educatedCeylonese Middle Class which demanded a share in the government of theCountry had also to be reckoned with. The Sinhalese and Tamils put forwardclaims for the introduction of territorial representation by election to the Legis-lative Council. Eventually, by Royal Instructions dated 24th November1910, a new departure was made. In a Council of eleven Official and tenUnofficial Members, four of the latter were to be elected two Europeans,one Burgher and one other Ceylonese. The electoral rolls were based on aliteracy test. The other six Unofficials were to be nominated, viz., two LowCountry Sinhalese, two Tamils, one Kandyan Sinhalese and one Muslim. Itwill be noticed -that the ^Official majority was still maintained. The newLegislative Council met for the first time on 16th January, 1912. The principleof election had been admitted and, as it happened, there was a departure fromcommunal representation, for the educated Ceylonese electorate returned aTamil. &apos;&apos;25. The agitation for further reform of the Constitution was greatlystimulated by events during the Great War of 1914 to 1918, particularly whenthe principles of future British policy towards India were defined, after theMontagu-Chelmsford discussions, as the gradual development of self-govern-ing institutions in the direction of responsible government. In 1917 the CeylonReform League and the Ceylon National Association, sent a memorial to theSecretary of* State in which they asked that the Legislative Council shouldhave a majority of Unofficials mainly returned by territorial constituencies.Much more specific claims were put forward two years later by the CeylonNational Congress, in which the Low Country Sinhalese were predominant.They &apos; asked for a Legislative Council of about fifty, four-fifths of whom were to be elected territorially on a broad male and a more limited female
franchise.   The other one-fifth was to consist of nominated Officials and &apos;Unofficials, the latter to be selected to represent important minorities.   At leasthalf of the members of the Executive Council should be Oeylonese chosenfrom among elected members of the Legislative Council.26. After consultation with the various interests in the Island, an Order inCouncil was promulgated on 13th August, 1920, which greatly- broadened thebasis of the Legislative Council. Its membership was increased to thirty-seven, fourteen being Officials and twenty-three Unofficials, thus for thefirst time giving the latter a majority. Of the twenty-three Unofficials, elevenwere to be elected territorially, three for the Western Province and one eachfor the other eight Provinces; five were to be elected by special constituencies,two by Europeans, one by Burghers, one by the Chamber of commerce and one by the Low Country Products Association. Two nominated seatswere given to the Kandyans, one each to the Indians, and the Muslims, andthree others were provided for any interests which had not secured represen-tation already. The principle of representative government was thus con-ceded, the constituencies being partly territorial (11) and partly special (5);the number of Nominated Members was reduced to seven. By Royal Instruc-tions to the Governor, three Unofficial Members were also&apos;&apos; added to theExecutive Council.27. The Ceylon National Congress immediately expressed its strong dis-satisfaction and asked for a real and substantial majority in the LegislativeCouncil and a much wider franchise. As it largely represented the viewsof the Low Country Sinhalese, its claims evoked counter-proposals from theother sections of the population now compendiously known as the minorities.Since both parties asked for&apos; a Legislative Council of forty-five, their diver-gence of views can best be indicated by their respective ideas as to the composition of this total. The one desired twenty-eight and the other onlynineteen to be elected territorially. As to the balance of seventeen. in theCongress scheme, eleven were to be reserved for minorities and six for Officials;of the balance of twenty-six in the Opposition^ plan, eleven were to becommunally elected and fifteen nominated, twelve being Officials and threeUnofficials.28. By the Ceylon (Legislative Council) Order in-Council, 1923, a newlegislative body was constituted, consisting of twelves-Official and thirty-sevenUnofficial Members. The Official Members were made up of five ex officioMembers (Senior Military Officer, Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Con-troller of Revenue and Treasurer) and seven other persons holding publicoffice under the Crown and designated Nominated Official Members. the growing pressure for the election Oof Unofficial Members was met by providing that twenty-three should be elected territorially and six communally (threeEuropeans, two Burghers and one Western Province Ceylon Tamil) andthat three Muslim and two Indian members should be nominated until such time as arrangements could be made for election, the franchise in. all casesbeing based on an income or property qualification and a literacy test. Pro-vision was made for only three Nominated Unofficial Members. Normally theGovernor was to make laws &quot; for the peace, order and good government ofthe Island,&quot; with the advice and consent of the Council. He could, if hechose, preside at its meetings and the initiation of any Money Bills rested with him. If he was of opinion that the passing of a Bill or of any clause of it or any amendment to it was of paramount importance, he could declareit to be so, and then the voting in the Council would be limited to the exofficio members and the Nominated Official Members, i.e., to twelve. this method was intended for use only in exceptional cases, and when the Governoremployed it he was required to report his reasons to the Secretary of State.
29- This Constitution did not prove workable. The new Legislative council was not formally inaugurated until 15th October, 1924, and within threeyears of that date the Secretary of State announced the appointment of aSpecial Commission under the chairmanship of the Earl of Donoughmorewith the following terms of reference:  &quot; To visit Ceylon and report on the working of the existing constitution and on any difficulties of administration which may have arisen in con-nection with it; to consider any proposals for the revision of the Consti-tution that may be put forward, and to report what, if any, amendments of the Order in Council now in force should be made.&apos;&apos;30. The Donoughmore Commission found that the principal defect in theConstitution was the unsatisfactory relation between the Executive and theLegislature. The process which had begun in 1920 of giving the unofficial members a majority in the Legislature had created a new situation. By suc-sucessive stages it had reached a point at which the principle of representative government had been conceded, but the elected representatives were not inany degree responsible for the conduct of the government. While the Legis-lative Council was unable to implement its decisions, the Governor, as Headof the Executive, could not enforce his will unless he secured the consentof the Council, except by the use of a special procedure which, if frequentlyemployed, would reduce representative government to a sham. If he hesi-tated to adopt this course, he had to attempt by one means or another to&apos;get the support of a majority in a Council in which the Elected Memberstended to form a permanent opposition, partly because &quot;they felt that thatwas the only way open to them to exercise any power, and partly becausethey knew that in any event they could not be called upon to assume responsibility. It is, of course, conceivable that the Constitution might havebeen worked successfully had there been a general desire to co-operate in doing so; but such co-operation would have meant that the Elected Members,now enjoying the substantial majority for which they had agitated, wouldhave had to remain content not to press for responsible as distinct fromrepresentative government.31. There is no need to recapitulate here the remedies which were suggested to the Donoughmore Commission or their criticism of them. Similar pro-posals have again come up for consideration and will be examined later in our Report. The Donoughmore Commissioners recommended that anOrder in Council should be promulgated which would &quot; transfer to the elected representatives of the people complete control over the internal affairs of the Island, subject, only to provisions which will ensure that they arehelped by the advice of experienced officials and to the exercise by theGovernor of certain safeguarding powers.&quot;* To this end they suggested thatthe existing Legislative Council should give place to a State Council with both legislative and executive functions. The State Council would divideitself into seven Executive Committees, each of which would elect its Chair-man, and those seven Chairmen, together with the Chief Secretary, theTreasurer and the Attorney-General to be called the Officers of State would form a Board of Ministers, though the Officers of State would not havevotes either in the State Council or the Board. The existing Executive council would be abolished and the Board of Ministers would become responsible forthe general conduct of the business of government and in particular for preparing the annual budget and estimates.The complete abolition of communal representation was recommendedand the new State Council was to consist of sixty-five Members elected terri-torially, three ex-crfficio Members, and nominated members up to a maximum* Report of the Special (Donoughmore) Commission on the Constitution, Cmd. 3131,Rv 149.
of twelve if the Governor considered it necessary to make the body more representative. The suffrage was to be extended to all men over twenty-oneyears of age and to all women over thirty years of age who applied to be registered as electors and had resided in the Island for a minimum periodof five years. Income, property and literacy qualifications were to be abol-lished.32. This amounted to a recommendation of responsible government, but ina novel form. Owing to the absence of political parties, it was felt thaiall members of the State Council should be given some experience of andsome share in administration hence the device of the seven Executive Com-mittees. This arrangement made it possible, though it by no means ensured,that the Board of Ministers, consisting of the Chairmen of the Committees,might be composite, containing representatives of the different communities. if so, the system might prove acceptable to the minorities; if not, the abolitionof communal electorates and the grant of universal adult suffrage would undoubtedly arouse their serious apprehensions; only the working ,of the newConstitution would show.33. In this summary of constitutional development prior to the Donough- -more Constitution of 1931, attention has been mainly directed to the changesin the structure of the Legislative Council. They illustrate not only thestages by which some degree of representative government had been attained by 1923, but the emergence of rival claims among the Ceylonese imme-diately the Unofficial element had gained a majority. It was inevitable thatthe largest community should advocate territorial representation, while the minorities clung to the principle of communal representation. This issue was first clearly denned in 1917 and it soon became one of major importance.The Orders in Council of 1920 and 1923 incorporated both principles. the donoughmore Commission of 1928 recommended that communal repre-sentation should be abolished.CHAPTER iii the DONOUGHMORE CONSTITUTION: THE FIRST STATE COUNCIL,1931-3634. We shall review later in this Report the evidence we have received onthe working of the present (Donoughmore) Constitution. Before doing so,however, we think it necessary to record the circumstances, in which theConstitution was adopted, the series of efforts made to get it amended, andthe general progress, particularly in the social sphere, which may fairly beascribed to its operation:-35. The Report of the Donoughmore Commission was presented to. Parlia-ment in July, 1928. As soon as it had been received and studied in Ceylon,a series of debates was initiated in the Legislative Council on 27th September;and on the 14th November a critical point was reached when the Governor,on the instructions of the Secretary of State, intervened. He informed theCouncil that the recommendations of the Commission must be regarded as awhole, and that amendments which touched matters of principle would there-fore not be accepted. During the debate the Unofficial Members had succeeded in carrying a number of motions which, taken together, wouldcertainly have completely changed the structure of the proposed new Constitu-tion., It was resolved, for instance, by a majority of fifteen, that government by Executive Committees as recommended in the Report was &quot; not suited to
local conditions &quot; and &quot; inacceptable to the people.&quot;. It was also resolved by a majority of twelve that Ministers should be elected by the whole Council,and not by the Executive Committees; and there were large majorities againstthe proposed extensions of the Governors powers. On the question of the franchise there was a decisive vote in favour of making the age for qualifica-tion the same for males and females; but a motion for the retention of theliteracy qualification was carried only by a narrow majority.36. Informal discussions then took place between the Governor (Sir HerbertStanley) and the various sections of the Legislative Council, with a view to reaching an agreement. The result is set out in detail in a despatch to theSecretary of State of 2nd June, 1929, in which the Governor had to admit that he saw no hope of securing the support of a large majority of the unofficial Members. The real difficulty turned on the question of the fran-franchise. The recommendation of universal adult suffrage, without income,property or literacy qualification, raised two issues, the one economic andthe other communal. Of these the communal proved by far the stronger.The &quot; leap in the dark &quot; alarmed those who feared that &quot; socialistic &quot; legis-lation would overstrain the financial resources of the country. This was theview expressed by Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, the veteran leader of theCouncil, who argued that educational advance should precede general en-franchisement. No doubt he did so in all sincerity; but unfortunately itcould be insinuated that he was biased because his community the CeylonTamils would enjoy a distinct advantage in a literacy test, particularly overthe more backward Kandyans. The Sinhalese, on the other hand, wereprepared to accept universal suffrage, but with the important proviso thatthe franchise of the Indian estate labourers should be much more restrictedthan the Donoughmore Commission had contemplated. Their attitude, there-more, might be represented as favourable to universal suffrage, withoutincome, property or literacy tests (but with special limitations on the Indiancommunity) because an unrestricted suffrage would give considerable advan-tage to the Sinhalese.37. Thus, on analysis, it was the proposal to abolish communal representa-tion that was at the root of the difficulty, for in the existing Legislative council the minority communities enjoyed, man for man, a greater voting power thanthe Sinhalese. The majority community would naturally welcome the removalof this disparity; but. it was anxious that its position should not be assailedin the future by the growth of Indian representation. The smaller minority communities Muslim, Burgher and European were of course in danger ofvirtual political extinction, if universal adult suffrage were adopted. TheMuslims might win one or two seats by the votes of their own community;but the Burghers and Europeans had no possibility of doing so. For them itwas generally conceded that something would have to be done, and the only possible course was the substitution of nomination for communal electorates,thus attaining the same end by different means.38. It became increasingly clear that the chances of getting the newConstitution accepted depended very largely on an understanding with theSinhalese Members of the Council as regards the Indian franchise. TheCommission had suggested that a period of five years&apos; residence was a suffl-. cient indication of an &quot; abiding interest &apos;&apos; in Ceylon or of &quot; permanent settlement there.- This was not considered satisfactory. As a result of negotiation the Governor proposed that the principle of domicile should bemade the standard test for all.* This would mainly affect the Indianlabourers employed in the plantations (as it was intended to do); Indian* The Indian franchise, and the complications which have arisen out of the domiciletest, are discussed more fully in Chapter X, paras. 205-222.
merchants and /traders could qualify for the vote by other means, for itwas suggested that for them the franchise conditions of the 1923 Constitution,with respect to income, property and literacy qualifications, should beretained.39. The other difficulties proved less formidable. Mention has been madeof the fact that a substantial majority of the Unofficial Members of the Councilrejected the proposed Executive Committee system on the ground that it would cause so much delay in the transaction of business as to be unworkable.The position of a Minister, appointed by his particular Executive Committee,would, they felt, be lacking in authority. They anticipated, too, that therewould be constant bargaining between the members of the Board of Ministersso elected, and that the resultant compromises would prevent a coherent policyfrom emerging.40. The Unofficial Members of the Council had rejected the proposed extension of the Governors powers by large majorities. They objected inparticular to the suggested additions to the subjects in respect of which his assent to legislation might be refused, and in general to the wide applicationof his reserve powers.41. On 10th October, 1929, the Secretary of State announced his&quot; decision that, with -certain modifications, the recommendations of the commission should be put into operation. He stated definitely that he was unwilling toaccept any amendments which upset the balance of the scheme. this involved the acceptance of the system of Executive Committees and also the enlarged powers of the Governor, which the Secretary of State considered essential as safeguards, in view of the fundamental changes envisaged abolition of communal representation, universal adult suffrage, and transferof executive authority to a. State Council. A division was taken on 12thDecember, 1929, on the motion &apos;&apos; that it is desirable in the interests of Ceylonthat the constitutional changes recommended by the Special Commission onthe Constitution, with the modifications indicated in the Secretary of State&apos;despatch of 10th October, 1929, should be brought into operation.&quot; NineteenUnofficial Members voted for and seventeen against acceptance.42. The Donoughmore Commissioners had recommended the redelimitationof constituencies, and when this had been completed the first elections for thenew State Council were held in June, 1931. They resulted in the return of thirty-eight Sinhalese (twenty-eight Low Country and ten Kandyan), threeCeyon Tamils, two Indian Tamils, two Europeans and one Muslim. The.small representation of the Ceylon Tamils was due to a boycott of the elections,as a protest against the abolition of communal representation, and four seats in the Jaffna Peninsula were not filled. To fill the nominated seats, theGovernor appointed four Europeans, two Burghers, one Indian and oneMuslim. Seven Executive Committees were constituted and the Chairman ofthe Committee for Home Affairs, the Hon. Mr. D. B. (later Sir Baron)Jayatilaka, was elected Leader of the Council. It should be noted that thetotal membership of the State Council under the Ceylon (State Council) Orderin Council, 1931, was sixty-one (fifty elected, eight nominated and threeOfficers of State), while the Donoughmore Commission had recommendedeighty (sixty-five elected, twelve nominated and three Officers of State). Thereduction in Elected Members from sixty-five to fifty may have meant a morethan proportionate reduction in the representation of minorities.43. The Donoughmore Commission had been appointed in August, 1927,because it was alleged that a virtual impassa had been reached under the exist-ing Constitution. Had the difficulties now been resolved? The adoption of thenew Constitution by a meagre majority of two suggests that they had not.
Apart from any defects which might he discovered in the actual working ofthe new scheme, there were two main grounds for dissatisfaction, the onepossibly inherent in the situation, and the other, if not created, certainlyaccentuated by the change. On the one hand, the Constitution did not conferfull responsible government, which still remained the objective of a certainbody of opinion; on the other hand, the abolition of communal representationhad aroused the apprehension of the minorities.44. It is not surprising, therefore, that in July, 1932, the question of the reform of the Constitution was again raised, on this occasion by a private member-of the State Council, Mr. E. W. Perera. Mr. Perera moved a seriesof seven resolutions, six of which were adopted. They dealt largely with theGovernor&apos;s powers and the alleged diarchy created in the Board of ministers by the allotting of important administrative functions to the three Officers ofState. A seventh resolution which condemned the Executive .Corhmittees onthe grounds that they led to divided responsibility, delays in administration and were &quot; unsuited for the government of a country,&quot; was decisively rejected.45. The Perera resolutions initiated a new reform movement. discussion between the Governor (Sir Graeme Thomson) and the Board of Ministersultimately led to a formal statement by the Governor on 17th February, 1933,that while in his opinion it was premature to make any fundamental changesin the Constitution, he was prepared to examine some specific points, suchas the method of election of Ministers, the re-allocation of the subjects and functions of the Executive Committees and certain proposals in regard to thePublic Services Commission, the creation of which had been recommended in the Donoughmore Report and accepted. On 21st April, 1933, the Hon.Sir Baron Jayatilaka replied on behalf of the Board of Ministers. He expressed their keen sense of disappointment at the nature and scop*e of the proposed amendments. The Board of Ministers, he asserted, could not agree that suchminor changes would solve &quot; the grave difficulties experienced in the workingof the present Constitution.&quot; Amendments should be real and &quot; directed toremove the main obstacles to responsible government in the country.&quot;Nothing else would satisfy &quot; the legitimate aspirations and demands of theState Council or the people.&quot;46. The tone, of this communication clearly indicates a sharp divergence of opinion between the Governor and the Board of Ministers on the questionof the reform of the Constitution. The Board now submitted their own proposals, together with a commentary on the working of the Constitutionduring the two years it had been in operation. The scheme put forward was,they considered, &quot; vital and urgently necessary for the purpose of ensuringits successful working.&quot; In the forefront the Board placed a demand for a&apos;:&apos; homogeneous Ministry wholly responsible to the Legislature,&quot; by whichwas meant the removal of the Officers of State and the substitution for them of Ministers with Executive Committees. This-would put an end to thediarchy to which reference has already been made. It was suggested that themethod of electing Ministers by the Executive Committees should be abolished.The Chief Minister, the Board considered, should be elected by the WholeCouncil and the other Ministers should be nominated by him, after whichCommittees would then be assigned to them. The reconstitution of the public services Commission and the curtailment of the special powers of the Governorwere also demanded.47. There are some significant features in this reform programme. It repre-sents a stage in the movement towards a responsible Ministry; homogeneitywas to be obtained by the removal of the Officers of State, and the leadership of the Chief Minister was to be strengthened by the provision that he should
nominate his colleagues. The Executive Committees, however, remainedunchallenged, partly because the vote in the State Council on the seventhPerera resolution had precluded the possibility of a direct attack, but also-for the more important reason that two Ministers belonging to minority com-munities wished to retain the Executive Committees and the right of thoseCommittees to elect Chairmen who would form the Board of Ministers. they regarded the existing arrangements as the only available means by which members representing minority communities could hope to be elected to ministerial office. One Minister also reserved the right to submit a memorandumon the necessity of instituting a Second Chamber, if the Governor&apos;s powers were curtailed.48. The points in the Board of Ministers&apos; memorandum were discussed in an interview with the Governor on 19th June, 1933. The Ministers agreedto submit a supplementary memorandum in elucidation of some of their proposals, and this the Governor received on 29th July. He had asked,among other things, what the relation was between the Perera resolutions andthe proposals put forward by the Ministers. The reply was that the latter were hot intended to supersede the former, but to amplify them and providea framework into which they might be fitted. It is obvious, as the Governorhad pointed out, that the Perera resolutions adopted by the State council by no means covered the same ground as the Ministers&apos; memorandum.The attempt made in the second memorandum to meet this point is not com-pletely convincing. The Governor also drew attention to the fact that, not-withstanding the rejection by the State Council of the Perera resolution onthe Executive Committees, the Ministers now proposed to make an importantchange in the method of appointing the Chairmen of the Committees. Tothis the Ministers replied that the trend of opinion both in the Council andin the country was in favour of modifying the Executive Committee systemso as to make the working of the Constitution less cumbersome and more efficient. They had to admit, however, that there was not unanimity in theBoard of Ministers itself on one of the specific amendments the methodof appointment of Ministers they had put forward. At the conclusion ofthe interview the Governor stated that he was definitely opposed to anyfundamental changes in the Constitution. It had worked without seriousfriction for the past two years, he thought, and changes would be premature.49. The Ministers submitted their supplementary memorandum to- theGovernor on 29th July, 1933. In the meantime a Bill had been introduced(iby Mr. G. C. S. Corea) and given its first reading on 24th July, to amend the Constitution mainly by giving effect to the Perera resolutions. TheGovernor considered that this had changed the situation, and he forwardedthe Ministers&apos; memoranda of 21st April and 29th July to the Secretary ofState on 16th August, deferring his comments until the debate on the bill was concluded.50. The State Council, however, felt that little or no progress was beingmade, and on 16th September a motion was unanimously passed &quot; that adeputation of five Members of the House be sent to the Secretaryof- State to urge for an immediate revision of the Constitution.&quot;On 21st September- the Secretary of State cabled expressing his surprisethat he should be asked to- receive a deputation at such short notice. He saidthat none of the facts known to- him would justify an immediate alterationof the present Constitution, nor had he received a considered statementfrom the Governor on &apos;&apos; the various and to some extent conflicting proposals contained in the memoranda of the Board of Ministers and in the Bill beforethe State Council.&quot;   He therefore could not agree to receive a deputation
until he had had an opportunity of considering a written statement of prT?posals and of the Governors views on them. He added that in any eventhe was not prepared to entertain any proposals for the reduction or materialmodification of the powers conferred on the Governor and the Secretary ofState by the Order in Council in relation to matters declared to be of para-mount importance, or in regard to- the maintenance of the efficiency of thePublic Service.51. In view of the Secretary of State&apos;s refusal to receive a deputation,the- Ministers brought the proposals contained in their memorandum of21st April, 1933, before the State Council, which accepted them on 15thNovember, the voting being thirty-four to fifteen. It is noteworthy thatthe representatives of the minorities, excepting one Tamil member whodeclined to vote, all voted against the proposals. The Bill introduced byMr. Corea was then withdrawn by leave of the Council, which againunanimously resolved that the Secretary of State should be asked to receive a deputation.52. The new Governor (Sir Edward Stubbs) submitted a report on this request on 21st February, 1934. He pointed out that, as a result of the debate in the State Council, the reform proposals were limited to a summarycontained in one paragraph of the memorandum of 21st April, 0:933, and did not cover the supporting detailed argument contained in that document and the further memorandum of 28th July, 1933. This limitation, he sug-gested, was dictated by the fact that unanimity could not be obtained infavour of the two memoranda as they stood. The proposed amendments ofthe Constitution which were put forward by the Board, of Ministers as theresult of two years of discussion were thus:  (en) The replacement of the Officers of State by Ministers and ExecutiveCommittees of the Council.(b) The strengthening of the position of the Board of Ministers by enabling them to initiate and carry out their financial policies.(c) Alteration in the method of election of Ministers (on this point a minority held that there should be no change).(d) The reconstitution of the Public Services Commission.(e) The deletion of the provision that the prior sanction of the governor should be obtained in the case of Bills, motions, resolutions or -votes affectingofficers in the Public Service.(/) The curtailment of the special powers of the Governor.On the ground that the Board of Ministers were not unanimous in favour ofthe proposals and by inference they were still more divided on the meansof implementing them-and that the State Council had by its votes shownthat all the minority members (except one, who declined to vote) were opposedto them, Sir Edward Stubbs advised the Secretary of State to adhere to hisformer decision and refuse to receive a deputation. The Governor was himselfconvinced that communal antagonism had been accentuated since the intro-duction of the Donoughmore Constitution, and consequently did not considerthe time opportune for any amendment of the Constitution in the directionof full responsible government.53. The Board of Ministers received the second refusal &quot; with the utmostregret and disappointment &quot;. They submitted, in a letter to the Governor,dated 31st July, 1934, that the notification of the State Council&apos;s acceptanceof the six proposals enumerated above, fulfilled the condition that a written statement should be forwarded to the Secretary of State before an interview
could be arranged. The Donoughmore Constitution, the Board continued to insist, was in the nature of an experiment, and six proposals drew attentionto the serious defects which had been revealed in its working. The claimto be heard on a matter of such vital importance, they submitted, was a veryproper one to make. The time was also appropriate, for the present state council had entered upon its last year and it was desirable that the whole position should be reviewed before the General Election.54. It is interesting to notice that in reiterating their criticism of the Con-stitution, the Board of Ministers or rather the majority, for the two membersof minority communities again expressed their dissent had moved somewhatfrom the position defined in the six proposals. They now stated definitely that in their opinion the only solution of the problem of the Executive wasthe election of a Chief Minister by the State Council or his appointment bythe Governor. (He should then assign portfolios to his colleagues, the ministerial committees becoming merely advisory. It would follow that the attempt to combine executive and legislative functions in the State council would be abandoned. On this last issue the Governor was in substantial agreement with the Board of Ministers. He considered that. the defects ofthe Committee system were real and inherent, and that it was a definitehindrance to efficient government and wholly unsuited to the country. Thedifficulty was that the minorities regarded it, faulty as it was, as some kindof safeguard to their interests, and a substitute would have to be &quot;found ifthis safeguard were removed. The Governor, tentatively advanced the sug-gestion of a Second Chamber; but the whole question ought, he considererl tobe referred to another Special Commission.55. The first State Council entered upon its final year without havinggained any practical result from the agitation for reform of the Constitution.The Governor was opposed to the reopening of the question, and the Secretaryof State, as we have mentioned already, had specifically said that he was unwilling to entertain any proposals for the reduction or material modificationof the Governor&apos;s powers. Moreover, the fact that Sir Baron Jayatilaka, inadvising the State Council to press for an interview with the Secretary ofState, had not revealed his attitude on this question was not calculated to inspire confidence. Most -significant of all, however, was the attitude of the minority communities. They had become seriously apprehensive, and on 8th June,1935, the Tamils (both Ceylon and Indian)&apos; and the Muslims sent a joint statement to the Secretary of State in which they set out their case in con-siderable detail. They declared that they had expressed their oppositionto the Donoughmore Scheme from the beginning and had viewed it withgrowing alarm since it had been put into operation. It was a complete andabrupt departure from the principles whieh had been. followed from 1833to 1923. The majority community had been placed in power as an inevitable result of the abolition of communal and the adoption of territorial representa-tion, and its persistent efforts to amend the Constitution&apos; could only beregarded as designed to complete its domination. The Sinhalese leaders were seeking to achieve this end by the limitation of the Governors powers, theremoval of the Officers of State, and amendment of the Committee system.The minorities asked, therefore, that representation in the State Council shouldbe so arranged that the majority community could not outvote the othercommunities taken together. The Committee system, they conceded, had its defects; but if Cabinet Government were to take its place, the absence ofpolitical parties would require a. composite cabinet containing minority repre-sentatives. This was particularly necessary because no provision had beenmade, as had been suggested in the case of the Provincial Legislatures inIndia, for a bicameral Legislature.
-    112CHAPTER iv the DONOUGHMORE CONSTITUTION: FROM THE 1936 election to THE 1943 DECLARATION56. The elections to the new State Council were completed by 10th March,1936. Although there were changes in personnel the representation of the communities remained practically the same, and thirty-nine Sinhalese (thirty-one Low Country and eight Kandyan), eight Ceylon Tamils, two Indians andone European were elected. The Governor recommended for the eightnominated seats four Europeans, two Muslims, one Indian and one Burgher.On 19th March, the third day of the opening session, the Executive Committeesproceeded to the election of their Chairmen, these constituting the new Boardof Ministers,   It had been so* arranged that all seven were Sinhalese.57. The so-called Pan-Sinhalese Ministry has been much discussed ever since. We need not inquire what various reasons had led the majoritycommunity to &quot;take the steps necessary to exclude all representatives of the minorities from the Board of Ministers. Sir Baron Jayatilaka, who was-elected Leader, later revealed two motives which had influenced the decision.Neither is wholly convincing. He told the Governor that this course wasdeliberately adopted because the minority members in the Board of ministers had consistently opposed an alteration in the method of selecting Ministers.They felt that under the existing arrangement they had some chance of getting one or more of their number elected. It was decided, therefore, togive them a practical demonstration of the fact that they had no better chance of getting elected under the existing method than under some modifica-tion of it. That what the majority had now done had always beentheoretically possible must have been common knowledge; but whether itwas wise to do it is extremely doubtful. The point needed no practical proof.To show that members of the minorities could be excluded from the Chair-manship of Committees-, and therefore from the Board of Ministers, was merely to make clear to them that they had to seek some other means of safeguarding their position. Nor could the demonstration be limited tothat. The action of the majority could be represented as indicating a policy on their part of using their power to the detriment of the minorities. Toprovide the minorities with this argument showed a singular lack of states-manship.58. If Sir Baron Jayatilaka&apos;s first argument was ill-advised, his secondwas disingenuous. He claimed that since unanimity had been reached onthe Board of Ministers, the Secretary of State&apos;s principal objection to there opening of the question of the amendment of the Constitution had nowbeen removed. Obviously, however, the Board&apos;s unanimity had not changed the situation, except for the worse. In requiring unanimity, the Secretaryof State had clearly intended to convey that he was not prepared to consider proposals for constitutional reform unless they were supported by the minoritymembers of the Board as well as by tire Sinhalese. To eliminate the minoritymembers not merely failed to satisfy this condition; it gave strong grounds for the belief that they had been excluded precisely because they could notbe induced to accept.the majority proposals, Moreover, as a result of thecreation of the Pan-Sinhalese Ministry, the minorities had grown still morealarmed, and it had become more difficult than ever to reach a measure ofagreement on constitutional reform in the State Council and in the country as a whole,59. After the delays caused by the preparation for and conduct of theGeneral Election, the new Board of Ministers resumed consideration of the
amendment of the Constitution. The Board were ready with their new proposals on 19th March, 1937, when they submitted a long memorandum to the Governor. It covered much the same ground as formerly with respectto the powers of the Governor and the functions of the Officers of State.The criticism of the Executive Committee system, however, was much moreoutspoken. It was said to deprive the Board of Ministers of any realinitiative, to make it impossible to fix responsibility for action anywhereand to cause endless conflicts and delays in the administration. The system had indeed become so&apos; unworkable that the Ministers had decided that theCommittees had better be replaced by the ordinary Cabinet form of Govern-ment. Either the Governor should call upon the Member of the State council who could command the support of a majority to form a Government,or a Chief Minister might be elected by the whole State Council and should then choose his Cabinet, it was a bo suggested that the Minister might havethe assistance of Deputy Ministers.60. The memorandum signed by the seven Ministers was duly published,and became the basis for further discussion. In his comments to&apos; the Secretaryof State, the Governor expressed his view that there could be no question for many years of reducing the Governors powers; in fact he thought theyneeded strengthening. He was also of opinion that the Officers of state should be retained. He considered that an independent Public services commission was impossible because of the lack of suitable persons to be members of it. The method of selecting Ministers, he thought, should be amended, but he was not prepared to say how. His conclusion was, however,that the Donoughmore Constitution &quot; must now be regarded as a provedfailure &quot; and he recommended the appointment of a new Commission to devise a more satisfactory form of Government..61. The general condemnation of the Executive Committee systemnaturally raised the question of some form of Cabinet Government as analternative. The Board of Ministers had agreed on the &quot; ordinary form &quot;without going into details. They had done so without consulting the Membersof the State Council. There, two difficulties could be anticipated. In thefirst place, some members of the majority community would not willinglysurrender the part they were able to play in administration through themachinery of the Executive Committees. In the second, the representativesof the minorities, although excluded from the Chairmanship of Committees,still retained some influence as members and would be averse to losing it.They could be expected to welcome a Cabinet system only if they had an assurance that it would provide some places for them. The formation ofthe Pan-Sinhalese Ministry did not appear to hold out any prospect of thatin the future.62. The discussion of reforms entered upon a new phase in November, 1937,when the Secretary of State (Mr. Ormsby Gore, now Lord Harlech) addressed.an important despatch to the new Governor (Sir Andrew Caldecott). In ithe said that he had for some time been giving serious consideration to thedesirability of effecting some amendments in the Constitution; and he in-structed the Governor carefully to examine the situation and, when hehad acquainted himself with the views of all sections of opinion in the island and had had time to form conclusions, to submit to him any recommendations  -tions he might wish to make. The despatch enumerated the main subjectsat issue, namely, the special powers of the Governor, the method of select-ing Ministers, the relations between the Ministers, the Executive Committeesand the State Council, the representation of the minority communities, andthe franchise.   With regard to the special powers of the Governor, the Secre-
tary of State gave strong expression to his own view; he not only reassertedthe opinion of his predecessors that the time was not opportune for any relaxation of&apos;the Governor&apos;s powers, but he considered that they needed tobe more clearly defined. Recent events (to which specific reference need notbe made here) had convinced him that the Governor&apos;s powers should be stated in terms which admitted of no dispute. The amendment of the ceylon (State&apos; Council) Order in Council, 1931, which he proposed to thisend, was much resented by the Board of Ministers and to some extentcreated an unfavourable atmosphere for the task which the Governor hadbeen asked to undertake.63. After receiving a series of deputations, and considering a number of memoranda and memorials, the Governor sent his recommendations to theSecretary of State in a despatch dated 13th June, 1938, which was acknow-ledged on 10th November, 1938, and presented to Parliament in December. *64. Sir Andrew Caldecotfs &quot;Reforms Despatch&quot; marks an importantstage in the discussion of the reform of the Constitution. Hitherto memorandahad been prepared by the Board of Ministers and representatives of the-chief minorities and had been commented upon by successive Governors.The Reforms Despatch is of a different nature. It was based on an indepen-dent sifting of the evidence, and the conclusions at which the Governor had arrived were forcibly, even provocatively, stated. Some critics characterisedthe Despatch as the findings of a one-man Commission, a description which its author repudiated. It was written with a vigour and directness unusual inofficial documents, and while some inconsistency may be detected here andthere, on close examination there is no ambiguity.65. Sir Andrew Caldecott agreed with the Secretary of State that thetime was not opportune for any relaxation of the Governor&apos;s special powers.So long as they were retained he considered a Second Chamber unnecessary;but he thought a bi-cameral government might be part of the future con-stitutional development of the Island. With regard to representation, he recommonded that elected seats should continue to be filled on a territorialfranchise, though he. suggested that the electoral areas might be re-drawnso as to afford a chance for the return of more members of the minority communities. Ten additional seats would, he thought, be sufficient for thispurpose. Delimitation of constituencies to this end was in his opinion avery different thing from representation of communities on a mathematicalformula. He consequently rejected a &quot; Fifty-fifty &quot; demand, which asked that half the seats should be assigned to the Sinhalese and half to the minorities, or any other scheme which involved &quot; fractional representation on a race basis.&quot; But an exception would have to be made for the european and Burgher communities. He recommended the retention of the principleof nomination by the Governor of four seats for Europeans and two forBurghers, possibly with two further nominated seats in reserve. On thegeneral ground that it was not practicable to withdraw privileges once theyhad been granted, the Governor rejected all proposals to restrict the fran-franchise or to re-impose any literacy or property qualification. He applied thesame principle to the proposals to alter the regulations which governed theIndian franchise, though he was not satisfied that they had been fullyobserved and therefore considered that they needed attention.66. The case against the Executive Committee system seemed to himoverwhelming.    The Executive Committees made administration cumbrous* Correspondence relating to the Constitution of Ceylon. Presented by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty, December, 1938.(Cmd. 5910.) The &quot; Reforms Despatch &quot; is also printed as Ceylon Sessional Paper XXVIIIof 1938.
and dilatory, they prevented any co-ordinated effort and hindered the emer-gence of any real ministerial policy or responsibility. These were defectsso inherent in the system that it could not be efficiently operated. TheGovernor therefore recommended the abolition of the Executive Committees.He was not convinced that they provided any safeguard for the minorities, theonly argument which had been strongly urged in favour of their retention. Thedesire to abolish them had led to the formation of the Pan-Sinhalese ministry and if they were retained he foresaw a succession of such Ministries. Hehad gathered from the Sinhalese leaders that they regretted the course theyhad taken, put they regarded it as forced upon them toy circumstances.In his opinion, therefore, the functions of the Executive Committees andthe Board of Ministers should be extended to a Cabinet of the normal type.This would naturally involve the removal of the Officers of State, for theycould not remain a constant factor in successive Ministries. While it hadto be admitted that the emergence of major&apos;political parties might be a slowprocess, conditions should be established which would make that evolutionpossible. The Governor should on his own initiative send for the memberof the State Council most likely in his opinion to command confidence as chief minister, and invite him to suggest the names of those who should hold theremaining. portfolios.67. The Governor had been so much impressed by the fact that the Sinhaleseleaders had in conversation deplored the necessity which, as they alleged,had drawn them to form a Pan-Sinhalese Ministry, that he was convinced that under a Cabinet system places would be found for representatives of the minorities. He favoured, therefore, the incorporation in the Ceylon Con-stitution of a clause similar to that in the Indian Instructions, which providedthat the Governor should &quot; use his best endeavours ... to appoint inconsultation with the person who in his judgment is most likely to command a stable majority in the Legislature, those persons (including so far as is practicable members of important minority communities) who will best be ina position ... to command the confidence of the Legislature.&quot;b8. The changes contemplated would on the one hand place greater indi-vidual and collective responsibility on Ministers and, on the other, relieve theState Councillors from their work on the Executive Committees. TheGovernor therefore recommended the appointment of Deputy Ministers and suggested that the extra expense involved in paying them (and the expensesof the proposed ten additional Members of the State Council already mentioned)might be met by reducing the existing rate of allowance to Members of theState Council. He also wished to remove the scandal caused by the frequentseizure for debt of Members&apos; allowances by providing that no Member should occupy his seat while his,allowance was under seizure by the Court.69. The removal of the Officers of State from the Board of Ministersraised issues of some complexity to which the Governor addressed himself.To some extent, he thought, the functions of the Officers of State could .be distributed among existing Ministries, but by no means entirely so. Some ofthe duties of the Chief mSecretary, for instance, could be allocated to theMinistry of Labour, Industry and Commerce, and others to the Ministry ofHome Affairs; but all important communications to other Governments infact the whole range of External Affairs necessarily&apos; came directly to thenotice of the Governor. The suggestion was therefore that the Chief Secre-tary, when deprived of his Ministerial standing, should become principal secretary to the Governor, and should act for the Governor when the latter was ill or on leave. He should also be Chairman of the Public Services Corn-mission. Similarly, while some functions of the Legal Secretary might betransferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs, that officer should be retained
as Legal Adviser because independent advice on constitutional questions would be necessary, and the Governor would require advice on the exerciseof the Royal clemency and as to the assent to legislation. The Legal Adviserwould also serve on the Public Services Commission and be President of theJudicial Appointments Board. Many functions performed by the FinancialSecretary, particularly with regard to establishments, could be transferredto the Public Services Commission; others could be allotted to a new Ministerfoi Finance. There would, however be need of an independent financial adviser, particularly in regard to the supervision of currency, banks, etc.,where expert guidance was essential. Representations had been made by ministers that a departure should be made in this instance from the general principle that the successors to the Officers of State should be purely advisory.It was recommended that the Financial Secretary/ should become the FinancialSecretary and Adviser and that he should exercise an executive and responsiblecontrol over the Treasury under the Finance Minister. He would thus besubject to ministerial direction in one capacity and independent of it in another; for he, like the Legal Adviser, could be consulted for technical* advice both by the Governor and the Cabinet. Complete responsibility for all measures introduced by them would rest with the Cabinet.70. The suggestions made above, it will be noticed, have a direct bearing on the composition of the Public Services Commission, which had so often been a subject of criticism. The Governors recommendation amounted to theretention of the existing membership the three Officers of State in their newnon-Ministerial guise, with the addition of not more than three Unofficalsnominated by the Governor and chosen from among ex-judges, of the SupremeCourt or others of similar standing. All routine postings, etc., should be delegated by the Governor to the Chairman of the Commission; the onlyappointments or transfers to be referred to the Cabinet to be those of theHead, or Deputy Head, of a Department or of a Government Agency.71. In submitting his recommendations, the Governor had no illusion thathe had resolved the difficulties which beset the working of the Constitution.His guiding principle was that self-government in internal affairs involvedresponsibility, and on his analysis of the existing arrangements it was impossibleto state precisely where it resided. Most of his suggestions, as he admitted,were dictated by the&quot;requirements of a Cabinet system. If these could notbe fulfilled, he had no remedy to offer. He was also aware that certain other&apos; aspects of his scheme would be attacked. The Sinhalese majority would strongly resent the proposed complete retention of the Governors powers, forthese had been&apos; consistently criticised and had recently been specially chal-lenged.- The minorities would resent his unqualified denunciation of com-munalism and would regard the addition of a maximum of ten additional seats in the State Council as quite inadequate to mitigate the predominance of themajority community.72. The Reforms Despatch was discussed by the State Council at greatlength and in minute detail. There were in all one general and twenty-onedetailed motions moved on the subject. The result was to expose difficultiesrather than any basis for possible agreement. The Governor had to- confessthat his proposals had not received &quot; the general consent of all importantinterests in Ceylon &apos;&apos; which the Secretary of State had defined as the desirable&apos;objective of the enquiry. The basic difficulty, as always, had been the ques-tion of minority representation. Arguments, whether they were ostensiblyabout the Governors powers, the respective advantages and disadvantages of the Executive Committee system and of Cabinet government, or anyother issue, really turned on the effect a proposal might be calculated to have on the relative position of the communities.
73- The critics of the.Reforms Despatch could point out that the Governorsprofessed intention to interfere as little as possible with the DonoughmoreConstitution was inconsistent with his proposal that the Executive Committeesystem should be abobshed. That was an essential part of the scheme whichhad been deliberately devised to afford protection for the minorities. Althoughit was impossible to prevent the Sinhalese majority from so constituting theExecutive Committees that they would have a homogeneous Board ofMinisters, the fact that there were minority representatives on each Executive. Committee ensured that the minorities would have knowledge of the mattersunder discussion and so would have an opportunity of stating any objectionsthey might have. They could not fail to have some influence on the decisions taken, and they might exercise a certain control over administrative action.74. The advocac)&apos; of the Cabinet system could also be represented as anattempt to throw off the curb on the unlimited power of the majority, whichthe Executive Committee system provided. Granted that the system wasunwieldy in some respects, it was not unworkable had there been a desireto work it. Persistent efforts had been made to exhibit its difficulties. Since .it was possible to form a homogeneous Board of Ministers which had controlof finance, co-ordination could have been achieved. But the majoritycommunity wished to get power into its own hands and found the ExecutiveCommittee system an obstacle to its policy. The Governor, it is true, con-templated a Coalition Cabinet, and here again he was accused of inconsist-ency. If the Board of Ministers found it necessary to establish homogeneity,why should it be assumed that a composite Cabinet would be workable?Would not the members of the minorities in it often find themselves either in conflict with their colleagues, or in danger of losing the confidence oftheir constituents? Cabinet instability might lead to eventual Cabinetdictatorship with the minorities excluded from office and deprived of allsafeguards. 1 , .75. These contentions res.ed on the assumption that the principle ofcommunalism was so strong that there was no prospect of the emergencyof political parties. The elimination of communalism from political lifeunder the Donoughmore Constitution was purely formal; to call the repre-sentation territorial was merely to disguise the fact that, it was fundamentallycommunal. In his Reforms Despatch the Governor had said that any concession to the principle of communalism would perpetuate sectionalism;,but he had suggested that the position might be eased by affording a chanceof more seats for minority candidates. This approach was( not unwelcome to the minorities. They did not demand communal electorates as such butfuller representation, and this might well be provided by a redistribution of territorial electorates. Here there seemed to be a ground for compromise.The Secretary of State (Mr. Malcolm MacDonald) in a despatch of 26thJanuary, 1940, suggested to the Governor that the possibility of a conference between the parties might be explored.76. The suggestion of ten additional seats was, however, not acceptable tothe minorities. It had been mentioned by the Governor as the number whichhe anticipated a Re-delimitation Commission might find sufficient. He had&quot;not intended that it should be taken as a maximum. The Board of Ministers,however, declared that they had read his recommendation in that sense, andthat they had supported the motion based upon it with that limit in mind.In doing so, they had incurred criticism for going so far, and to re-open thequestion would be to run the risk of forfeiting the confidence of their supporters. The idea of a conference between the leading interests, whichhad heen suggested by the Secretary of State, had therefore to be abandoned.
77- Failure to agree on the. question of increased representation for the minorities was fatal to the scheme S:r Andrew Caldecott had proposed; andwe have laid particular stress on this issue, because it was by far the mostimportant in. the debates on the Reforms Despatch. Incidentally, however,it is worth noticing that there were other features of the Governors recom-mendations which did not commend themselves to the State Council. Themethod suggested for securing minority representation in the Cabinet, andthe proposal that there should be Deputy Ministers, were both rejected, and practically the whole of the Governor&apos;s suggestions for dealing with theproblems arising out of the removal of the Officers of State and the reorganisa-tion of the Public Services Commission met with strenuous opposition. Theproposal that a Principal Secretary to the Governor should be substituted forthe Chief Secretary was heavily defeated and the suggested provision in theConstitution for Advisers to the Governor was not accepted.78. The Reforms Despatch and the prolonged debate on it had only served to demonstrate the difficulties which beset the problem of constitutional reform. The outbreak of the European War in September, 1939, introducednew complications. It immediately raised the question whether the life ofthe State Council should be extended and, if so, for how long. The GeneralElection was due to be held not later than January, 1941, and the Board ofMinisters was strongly of opinion that it should not take place under theexisting Constitution. As efforts to reach agreement about reform had failed,the alternatives were either to postpone the General Election, or to imposereforms in the interim by Order in Council. The Secretary of State was notprepared to take the latter course. It was natural that there should be acertain divergence of., opinion between the British Government and that of ceylon on the question of urgency. &apos; The war involved incalculable commit-ments in Europe, but it was as yet&quot; remote from the Far East. In Ceylonthe agitation for constitutional reform had been dragging on for years andrecently the whole subject had been exhaustively examined, and it did not therefore seem unreasonable to demand a pronouncement from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The Governor reported growing unrest and stated his conviction that it was necessary to postpone the General Election and in the interval toappoint a Commission to advise the Secretary of State on constitutional reform.He felt that the postponement should be for a definite term and not for the duration of the war. In the end, a two years&apos; postponement of the GeneralElection was decided upon and on 15th June, 1940, the following announce-ment was made public:  &quot; In view of the general dissatisfaction with the present constitution and of the questions that have arisen regarding cognate problems offranchise and delimitation of constituencies, an Order in Council will been acted to enable the postponement for two years of the election which isdue not later than next January under Article 19. The postponement isnecessary in present circumstances if careful decisions are to be reached on these questions before new elections are held.&quot;79. Clearly the intention was to arrive at decisions on constitutional reformwithin the period of the two years&apos; extension of the life of the State Council.But. the war in Europe entered upon a new and more critical phase with the collapse of France, and the Secretary of State came to the conclusion thatactive consideration of constitutional reform was impracticable until after thewar. This would probably involve a further postponement of the GeneralElection. The Governor was greatly concerned about the effect of an arrange-ment on these lines. He was involved in acute controversy with the ministers on the question of the Indian franchise and did not wish to raise furtherdifficulties.    If the life of the State Council was further extended,  the
Ministers themselves would have to face criticism on the ground that theywere clinging to office. Moreover, the demand for constitutional reform was taking a new turn; it was no longer a question of amendment of the donoughmore Constitution, but of the granting of Dominion status, and whileit/might appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government that, in all the circumstancesof the moment, the consideration of constitutional issues in Ceylon couldwell be deferred, it was difficult to meet the allegation that advantage wasbeing taken of the war situation to justify further delay. After a carefulassessment of the whole situation, the -Secretary of State instructed theGovernor to communicate the following assurance of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to the Board of Ministers:  His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under further consideration thequestion of constitutional reform in Ceylon. The urgency and importanceof reform of the Constitution are fully, recognised by His -Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment; but before taking decisions upon the present proposals for reform,concerning which there has been so little unanimity but which are of such importance to the well-being of Ceylon, His Majesty&apos;s Government would desire that the position should be further examined and made the. subjectof further consultation by means of a Commission or Conference. TheBoard of Ministers will appreciate that this cannot be arranged under war conditions, but the matter will be taken up with the least possible delayafter the war.&quot;This statement was communicated to the Board of Ministers on istSeptember, 1941. ;80. &quot;The Board of Ministers expressed their strong dissatisfaction with this statement. They pointed&apos; out that the delay contemplated was for an indefinite period and might be protracted. The defects in the existing Constitutionhad become obvious and its further operation would be detrimental to thebest interests of the country. The life of the State Council had been extended for two years for the specific purpose of dealing with the question of reformwithin that time. Furthermore, the Board also opposed the appointment ofa Commission or the holding of a Conference, for the Governor had recentlyexamined the subject exhaustively and his recommendations had been care-fully considered by the State Council. No new material was likely to be forthcoming and an enquiry would merely serve to create ill-will among thevarious sections of the community. The Secretary of State considered these representations and decided that the Statement of ist September, 1941, shouldbe placed before the State Council on&apos; 28th October, 1941, without anyemendation except the omission of the reference to the Board of. ministers in the final sentence. The Board thereupon formally reiterated their dissatis-faction with it on the grounds already summarised.81. It will be noticed that no reference was made in the statement to thepossibility that the General Election might have to be further postponed.The fact, however, that the discussion of constitutional reform was to be deferred until after the war meant that the original ground on which thetwo years&apos; extension of ihe life of the State Council had been justified nolonger held good. The alternative of a General Election under th&apos;i existing constitution or a further postponement might well have proved embarrassing to the Board of Ministers had not the entry of Japan into the war in December,1941, completely changed the situation. On 10th February, 1942, theGovernor was authorised by the Secretary of State to send a message to theState Council, announcing a further postponement. This provoked a motion of non-confidence in the Board of Ministers, but it was defeated by 36 votes to 6.82. The prolongation of the life of the State Council and the proposeddeferment of the discussion of the constitutional problem until after the war
27 1by no means suspended the agitation for reform. It was in fact stimulated by events and given a more definite direction. The mission of Sir stafford cripps to India led the Board of Ministers to ask whether he might visitCeylon, or at least receive a deputation in India on the Island&apos;s request for a declaration of Dominion Status after the war. The State Council hadon 26th March, 1942, pressed a resolution in favour of this, the only dissen-tients being the European and Burgher Nominated Members. The Secretaryof State replied that it was impossible for Sir Stafford Cripps to visit Ceylonor to deal with Ceylon problems, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government wishedto renew their pledge that when victory was won the question of constitu-tional reform would immediately be re-examined.83. Nevertheless, strong representations continued to be put forward that,to maintain the war effort in Ceylon and to counteract the influence ofextremist elements, some comprehensive declaration of the intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in regard to constitutional reform ought to be made.The actual terms of the proposed statement were not ready for publicationuntil 26th May, 1943, when the Governor was instructed to communicate them to the State Council. This detailed declaration forms the basis of allsubsequent discussions and lays down the principles to which the proposed new. Constitution should conform. It was designed to give greater precisionto the. Statement of 1st September, 1941, and to remove any doubts asregards the extent to which His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared tomeet Ceylonese aspirations.   The Declaration* reads:  &quot; (1) The post-war re-examination of the reform of the Ceylon Con-stitution, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, will bedirected towards the grant to Ceylon by Order of His Majesty in Council,of full responsible Government under the Crown in all matters of internalcivil administration.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain control of the provision, con-struction, maintenance,-security, staffing, manning and use of such de-fences, equipment, establishments and communications as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may deem necessary for the Naval, Military and. Air securityof the Commonwealth, including that of the Island, the cost thereof beingshared between the two Governments in agreed proportions.(3) Ceylon&apos;s relations with foreign countries and with other parts ofthe British Commonwealth of Nations will be subject to the control and direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(4) The Governor will be vested with such powers as will enable him,if necessary, to enact any direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regardto matters within the scope of paragraphs 2 &quot;and 3 of this Declaration;and his assent to local measures upon these matters will be subject to reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(5) The present classes of Reserved Bills in the Royal Instructions willbe largely reduced under a new Constitution. Apart from measures affect-ing Defence and External Relations, it is intended that these shall be restricted to classes of Bills which: -(a) relate to the Royal Prerogative, the rights and property of HisMajesty&apos;s subjects not residing in the Island, and the trade and ship-ping of any part of the Commonwealth;(&amp;) have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious com-munity and which in the Governor&apos;s opinion are likely to involve oppres-sion or unfairness to any community;(c) relate to currency.* Hansard, 26th May, 1943. Columns 1555-1557. Also printed in Ceylon SessionalPaper XVII of 1943.
(6) The limitations contained in the preceding paragraph will not bedeemed to prevent the Governor from assenting in the King&apos;s name toany measure relating to, and conforming with, any trade agreements cort-cluded with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Ceylon withother parts of the Commonwealth. It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that the Island&apos;s commercial relations should be settled by the con-clusion of agreements, and His Majesty&apos;s Government will be pleased toassist in any negotiations with this object.(7) The framing of a Constitution in accordance with the terms of this declaration will require such examination of detail and such precision of definition as cannot be brought to bear so long as the whole of the energiesof the Service and other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government must remain focussed on the successful prosecution of the war. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will, however, once victory is achieved, proceed to examineby suitable Commission or Conference such detailed proposals as theMinisters may in the meantime have been able to formulate in the wayof a complete constitutional scheme, subject to the clear understandingthat acceptance b3&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government of any proposals will depend:  First, upon His Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied that they are infull compliance with the preceding portions of this Statement,&quot;Secondly, upon their subsequent approval by three-quarters of ailMembers of the State Council of Ceylon, excluding the Officers of Stateand the Speaker or other presiding Officer.(8) In their consideration of the problem, His Majesty&apos;s Government have very fully appreciated and valued the contribution which Ceylon has made and is making to the war effort of the British Commonwealth and theUnited Nations,- and the co-operation which, under the leadership of theBoard of Ministers and the State Council, has made this contribution effec-. tive.&quot;CHAPTER V.THE   DONOUGHMORE   CONSTITUTION:   DEVELOPMENTS   SINCETHE 1943 DECLARATION84. The Declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of May, 1943, should ofcourse be read in conjunction with the 1941 Statement to which it was designed to give greater preosion. It certainly marked a great step forward,for while it did not make any specific allusion to Dominion status, it definedthe objective of constitutional reform as the grant of full responsible govern-ment in all matters of internal civil administration. The invitation to theMinisters to formulate their proposals to this end meant that they couldcomprehensively review the results of the long discussion of the inadequaciesof the Donoughmore Constitution and draw up a scheme which in theiropinion would work more successfully. This scheme was to fall within theterms of the Declaration and commend itself to a three-fourths majority ofthe State Council.85. These conditions raised two questions. Was the Declaration sufficientlyexplicit to enable the Ministers to draft a scheme? How &quot;was the requisitethree-fourths majority to be ensured? In a statement made on behalf of theMinisters on 8th June, 1943, the Leader of the State Council (The Hon. Mr.D. S. Senanayake), while acknowledging that the terms of the Declarationrepresented substantial gains and expressing the Ministers&apos; willingness to
prepare a draft Constitution, asked that a number of points should B% further!elucidated. He presented a series of interpretations on which the comments of His Majesty&apos;s Government were invited. The Secretary of State repliedby drawing attention to paragraph 7 of the Declaration and regretting thathe could not enter into details. The Ministers insisted in a communication of6th July that they could not proceed with drafting a scheme until they knewwhether their interpretations were acceptable. The Secretary of State pointedout that the Declaration was confined to a statement of broad principles andthat to enter upon a discussion of details would be inappropriate at that stage;but he found nothing in the interpretations &quot; essentially irreconcilable &quot; withthe conditions laid down in the Declaration. This reply was considered to be suffiently satisfactory and the Leader of the House announced on 15th July,1943, that the Ministers proposed to proceed, with the drafting of a constitution.86. The Ministers recognised that the condition that the draft Constitu-tion should receive the approval of three-fourths of the Members of the state council (excluding the Officers of State and the Speaker) was a difficult one.The 1941 Statement had drawn attention to the lack of unanimity on reformproposals; in fact, this had proved the real obstacle at every stage. Neverthe-less, the Ministers expressed their confidence that the State&apos; Council possessed&quot; the larger patriotism that transcends sectional difficulties,&quot; a phrase which seemed to suggest that they would take steps to- ascertain whether their proposals were likely to&apos; receive general approval.87. The Ministers decided that their Scheme should take the form of anOrder in Council. This had the advantage of requiring precision of statement and comprehensiveness. The formidable task of drafting it was completed by the beginning of February, 1944, and copies were forwarded to the Secre-tary of State. While it was being compiled by the Ministers, misgivings about its possible contents were expressed on behalf of the Government of Indiaand of minority communities in Ceylon. The former was concerned about thestatus of Indians and the latter complained that they had not been consulted.Tire procedure adopted by the Ministers, they alleged, had aroused resentmentamong minority communities. They pointed out that there were vital differ-ences of opinion on the quantum of representation of the different communi-ties, the status of Indians and Europeans resident in Ceylon, the system of executive Committees and the establishment of a Second Chamber. To these representations the Secretary of State could only reply that he could notintervene, for the Ministers must use their own discretion about the procedurethey adopted in preparing their draft.88. The Declaration of 1943 had made it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would examine any detailed proposals submitted by the Ministers bymeans of a suitable Commission or Conference once victory was achieved.The Ministers, however, now began to press for an immediate considerationof their scheme. They submitted that urgent local circumstances made anearly decision a vital necessity. Unless the fife of the State Council was againextended,- a General Election would have to take place early in 1945 and afurther extension would not be acceptable to public opinion unless theannouncement of it was accompanied by an assurance that the General Elec-tion would be held under the new Constitution and within a reasonable time.This was in fact a request to vary the terms of the 1943 Declaration. TheSecretary of State could hardly be expected, to agree to do so unless he was convinced that serious difficulties might arise, either if events were allowedto take their course and a General Election was held early in 1945, or if the life of the State Council was extended without any reference being made tothe impending promulgation of a new Constitution.
Hansard, 5th July, 1944.   Columns 1142-43.89. After a careful assessment of the situation, the Secretary of State madea statement in the House of Commons on 5th July, 1944. Its terms are important because they led to an unfortunate difference of opinion with theBoard of Ministers.   It ran :  &apos;&apos; In their Declaration of 1943 on the subject of the reform of the CeylonConstitution, His Majesty&apos;s Government invited the Ceylon Ministers tosubmit proposals for a new Constitution, and promised that once victorywas achieved such detailed proposals as the Ministers might in the mean-time have been able to formulate in the way of a complete constitutionalscheme would be examined by a Commission or Conference. ministers have now submitted their draft scheme with an urgent request that arrange-ments may be made for its examination at an earlier date than that con-templated in the Declaration.His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided to appoint a Corn-mission to examine the Ministers&apos; proposals, which would visit Ceylon forthis purpose towards the end of the present year. The adoption of thiscourse does not entail in other respects any modification of the Declarationof His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the eventual approval by HisMajesty&apos;s Government of any new Constitution. It is the intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the appointment of the Commission should provide full opportunity for consultation to take place with the various interests, including the minority communities, concerned with the subjectof constitutional reform in Ceylon, and with the proposals which ministers have formulated.Further, in accordance with the object already declared of avoiding aGeneral Election in Ceylon during the war, with consequent dislocation of ceylon&apos;s war effort, the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931,will be amended so as to prolong the life of the existing State Council fora further period of two years. &quot;*90. The Ministers took strong objection to the statement that the Corn-mission should consult &quot; the various interests, including the minority com-munities, concerned with the subject of constitutional reform in Ceylon andwith the proposals which Ministers have formulated.&quot; They contended thatthis amounted to a fundamental departure from the terms of the Declarationof 1943. In the interpretation of the Declaration which they had submittedto the Secretary of State, and in which he had found nothing &quot; essentiallyirreconcilable &quot; with its terms, two conditions only had to be fulfilled, namely,the Ministers&apos; proposals were to be examined by a Commission to determine whether they were in accord with the Declaration and then presented to theState Council where a majority of three-fourths was required for their adoption. The Ministers held that the function of the Commission should be strictly limited to an examination of the Ministers&apos; Scheme and that the minorities would be sufficiently protected by the stipulation of a three-fourthsmajority when it came to be discussed in the State Council.91. The Ministers were aware that protests had been made against the secrecy with which they had prepared their scheme, and they knew that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had from the beginning of the discussion of reformbeen much concerned about the lack of unanimity on the subject. A completeanswer to the suggestion that the Commission should hear the submissionsof the minority communities would have been that the Ministers had them-selves already ascertained their views; but this they had failed to do, althoughsuch a course would clearly have been the best way of assuring the necessarysupport in the State Council.   To enquiries we made in Ceylon why, the
Ministers proceeded as they did, those concerned to defend their attitudeinvariably replied that the Secretary of State had asked the Ministers, and theMinisters only, to prepare a constitutional scheme, and that he had given nodirections as to consultation with the minorities, who were fully safeguarded by the stipulation as to the three-fourths majority. This explanation has only to be stated for its inadequacy to be obvious. There can in our view be no doubt that the Ministers deliberately avoided consultation with the minorities because they knew that the latter would not agree to go as far inthe direction of Dominion status as the Ministers desired. Little progress canbe made in public affairs by strict adherence to the letter of documents and complete neglect of the spirit of compromise.- 92. As a result of the misunderstanding, the Ministers decided to withdraw their scheme.; On nth September it Was, however, published with an explanatory Memorandum as Sessional Paper XIV of 1944, and is printedin Appendix I to this Report. In withdrawing it, the Ministers stated thatthey had done so not because they would have had any hesitation in recommended-mending it to the State Council, but because, in their opinion, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had failed to carry out the undertaking given in the Declarationof 1943.93. It is to be noted that, notwithstanding the circumstances in which theMinisters had formulated their scheme, they had failed to reach completeunanimity on all points, since the Hon. Mr. A. Mahadeva, a Ceylon Tamilwho had joined the&apos;Board as Minister for Home Affairs late in 1942 and thus become its one minority member, recorded his disagreement with the proposals regarding representation^94. It was announced on 20th September, 1944, that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had decided to appoint a Commission with the terms of reference setout in the first paragraph of this Report. A promise was given that themembers of the Commission would arrive in Ceylon before the end of theyear.95. Although the Ministers&apos; scheme was not technically before the Corn-mission, - it naturally provided a most valuable basis for discussion and was of great assistance in focussing attention on the salient features of constitutional reform. It is interesting to notice how it dealt with questions which had solong been under discussion. The much criticised Executive Committees and board of Ministers were to be superseded by a Cabinet of ten Ministers, ofwhom one was to be the Prime Minister. He was to be appointed by theGovernor (now to be Governor-General) and the other Ministers were to beappointed on his recommendation. Deputy Ministers, not to exceed thenumber of Ministers, might be appointed to assist them. The Legislature wasto be unicameral and called the Council of State; but powers were taken toestablish a Second Chamber to be called a Senate, if thought desirable, atsome future time. The Ministers explained that this was a controversial issue and they doubted whether the proposal to establish a Second Chamber would secure the requisite three-fourths majority in the State Council. The pro-vision made in the scheme would, they pointed out,, enable the Council ofState, when it wished, to establish a Senate by a bare majority.96. The Legislature was to consist of approximately one hundred members,ninety-five of them to be elected on a territorial basis. This was a significant increase in membership. It will be recalled that the Donoughmore Com-mission had recommended the figure of eighty, sixty-five to be elected; butthe Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, had adopted sixty-one,fifty being elected.   As recently as 1940 the Ministers had resisted a suggestion* S.P. XIV, page 5, para. 10.
that the membership of the State Council might be increased by an additionof more than ten elected members. They now of their own initiative proposedan increase of forty-five. Such an increase undoubtedly offered greater oppor-tunity for the representation of the minority communities, and the principleof additional weightage for the minorities within a. territorial system was recognised by combining the criteria of population and area in determining the electoral districts. Since the majority of Tamils and Muslims are in theless densely populated areas, this method was calculated to meet, at any ratein part, their demand for greater relative representation without accepting the principle of communal representation as such. The scheme also providedthat the Governor-General, acting in his discretion, might appoint to theCouncil additional members not exceeding six in all, to represent any importantinterest he might consider insufficiently represented.97. There is no reference in the Ministers&apos; scheme to the question of the franchise. From this it may be inferred that they intended that there should,be no change as far as those who possessed a domicile in Ceylon were con-cerned. The Indian franchise would be a matter for settlement if and when a basis was reached for re-opening the negotiations broken off in 1942 betweenthe Governments of India and Ceylon on questions connected with immigrationof Indians into Ceylon and their status, domicile, franchise, etc.; there.*98. The powers of the Governor-General were limited in matters of internal administration in accordance with the principles of responsible government,while he retained overriding powers with respect to the reserved subjects of external Affairs and Defence. The Officers of State disappeared andtheir functions were to be taken over by responsible Ministers. Appoint-ments to the Public Services Commission, to a Judicial Services Commissionto be constituted, to the post of Chief Justice and to the Supreme Court Benchwere left in the hands of the Governdr-General, acting in his discretion after consulting the Prime Minister, whose advice he was not, however, boundto take.99. Such are the main provisions of the constitutional scheme preparedby the Ministers on the basis of their interpretation of the 1943 declaration and withdrawn by them in August, 1944. As we have already explained inthe concluding paragraphs of the Prologue to this Report, we have regardedthis scheme, notwithstanding its withdrawal, as one of those to be consideredduring our inquiry; and in later chapters we shall subject it to the close examination which its importance desenves. It now remains to complete oursurvey of the working of the Donoughmore Constitution and the movementunder it for further reform, by considering the progress made in social servicessince its introduction in 1931, the position of the minorities under it and thecharges of discrimination against them in favour of the Sinhalese, and thespecial claims of the Kandyans. These questions we- shall deal with in thenext four chapters, after which we shall proceed to an examination of thevarious constitutional proposals put before us, including the Ministers&apos; scheme,and to the formulation of our recommendations.CHAPTER VISOCIAL PROGRESS UNDER THE DONOUGHMORE CONSTITUTION100. Concentration of attention on the criticisms of the Domoughmore Con-stitution serves to reveal the phases through which the reform movement had passed in the last decade; it tends, however, almost completely to obscure theprogress achieved, particularly in the sphere of social improvement, despiteFor details of these negotiations see Chapter XI below.
33 1the shortcomings of the form of government. The Donoughmore Commiis-sioners, it should ibe remembered, based their case for the extension of the franchise to all adults partly on their belief that it would stimulate the social and industrial legislation essential&apos; to&apos; a society passing through vital economicdhanges. They pointed out that there were serious gaps in the social structure-ture owing to the absence of any poor law system, of up-to-date factorylegislation, of provision for workmen&apos;s compensation, of control over sweatedtrades and of adequate facilities for primary education.101. It is necessary, therefore, to inquire how far the hopes based onthe grant of adult suffrage have been justified since 1931. The franchise initself does not awaken a general social consciousness, particularly when it isgiven without previous agitation for it. But the fact that would-be repre-seotatives of the people have to seek popular support forces them tothink of the grounds on which they can solicit such support. no doubt the donoughmore Commissioners hoped that political programmes would be announced which would turn attention from communal to party politics.Their hopes, it is true, have not yet been realised. Nevertheless, it can be&quot;said that considerable advances in social legislation have been made, andthese must be explained to a large extent by the response of the State Councilto the needs of the people, whether consciously expressed or not.102. Social legislation involves expense. In justice to the State Councilit must be remembered that alt came into&apos; office at a time of acute and world-wade economic depression. This had serious repercussions in Ceylon, for,dependent as it so largely is on the export of three agricultural products tea, irubber and copra the collapse of world markets inevitably involvedmuch distress. Hardly had signs of recovery shown themselves when thefailure of the South-West monsoon in 1934 brought new disaster. Theshortage in the food craps meant famine over wide areas. This was followedby the most severe malaria epidemic in ire cent years, which lasted fromthe autumn of 1934 to the summer of 1935, and relief measures had to beundertaken on an extensive tcale. For these reasons there was an urgentcall for extraordinary expenditure at a time when the revenue showed aconsiderable shrinkage. In 1935 the cost of various forms of relief amountedto more than six million rupees and, despite the recent imposition of an income tax, there were deficits in the National Revenue.103. With a tax system which had been built up mainly on indirect taxa-tion, it was difficult, even in favourable circumstances, to expand the revenue to meet new charges. It encouraged the practice of adjusting expenditure to taxation rather than of budgeting for development. New taxes alwaysarouse opposition, and allegations that the- limit of taxable capacity hasbeen reached are easier to make than to rebut. Reference to the revenue and Expenditure figures in Appendix V wall show that there .has been amarked growth under both heads between the financial years 1936-37 and( 1942-43, the most significant fact being the growing proportion wMch the produce of the income tax bears to the total yield of all taxes. From this itcan be inferred that the problem of converting a somewhat inflexible tax system into one which produces some means for development has beenpartially solved. This is confirmed by the outer)/ against the income tax,accompanied by the charge that money is being squandered.104. The attack has been particularly directed against the increasingexpenditure on education. It will be recalled that when the DonoughmoreReport was under consideration Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan contended that education should precede the extension of the franchise. he was alarmedat the prospect of political power passing into the hands of men and women of whom such a large proportion were illiterate.   Experience since 1931 has
to some extent justified his apprehensions. Nevertheless it may be questioned whether so much progress would have been made in education in the last decade or so had the suffrage remained restricted. Adult suffrage has un-doubtedly stimulated the politically conscious minority to provide greatereducational facilities for the rather apathetic majority. Progress- has been based not so much on popular demand as on the recognition by leaders ofopinion of the need to educate the masses. Ample proof of this may befound in the steps taken to compel parents to send their children to school,and in the fact that so many children are withdrawn before the legal school-leaving age.105. The total net expenditure on education has risen from some twelvemillion rupees in 1931 to over thirty-four million rupees in 1945, and alarge percentage of the public revenue is now devoted to education. Butthe figure is deceptive. The &quot;Board of Ministers has ruled that capitalexpenditure on education may not be met out of loan funds. The Ministerfor Education has in consequence to provide for his building programmeout. of the annual vote, and this naturally sets a serious limit to it; for ifhe commits himself heavily in that direction he reduces thereby the amount available for current expenditure on the improvement of already existing facilities. Considering that the total public debt of Ceylon barely exceedsone year&apos;s Revenue, such extremely conservative finance cannot be justified.It would be difficult to estimate what the state of education in Great britain would be if capital expenditure on the provision of school buildings hadbeen met entirely out of revenue.106. Primary education is legally compulsory; but from what we have said it will be clear that it is not so in fact. There are not nearly enoughschools to accommodate all the children, and a large number of the pupilsdo not attend long enough to gain any real profit from the instruction. Inthis connection the educational statistics for 1944 given in Appendix VIIIshould be studied. It will be noticed that a distinction is drawn throughoutbetween &quot; Government &quot; and &quot; Assisted &quot; Schools, i.e. between the schoolscompletely under Government control and those provided mostly by religiousbodies and in receipt of Government grants. It has been the policy of theMinister for Education (The Hon. Mr. C. W. W. Kannangara) since 1931 toprovide Government schools throughout the country. The significant fact isthat, while there has been very little increase in the number of English andBilingual schools between 1931 and 1944, there has been a remarkable expan-sion in the provision of Vernacular (Sinhalese and Tamil) schools. Therewere 1,395 Government Vernacular schools in 1931 and 2,455 in 1944; the assisted Vernacular schools increased from 2,246 to 2,814 in the same period.This represents a total increase of 1,628 in this type of school. It will berealised that new buildings could not be provided for all these schools out ofthe annual revenue. The Minister appealed to public and individual philan-thropy for funds to put up semi-permanent buildings where necessary, theState to pay for maintenance and the teachers&apos; salaries. The authorities ofBuddhist Temples were also asked to allow schools to be conducted in theirhalls on similar terms until money was forthcoming. Practically ail these schools have now become Government schools.107. A great increase in the number of Vernacular schools is still necessaryto provide primary education for all. Indeed, universal suffrage cannot func-tion properly without it. But a policy of primary education for all involves the provision of considerably more than primary schools. Above all, trainedteachers are required. Reference to Appendix VIII will show that thereare only 23 Training Schools 5 Government and 18 Assisted with 990students.   The Minister wishes to increase the total number of Training
35 *    120Schools a policy which has involved him in somewhat acrimonious con-troversy with the religious bodies. A more serious difficulty, however, is thatthe education provided in the Vernacular schools cannot become the first stage to secondary and higher education unless the teaching of English is intro-duced. The Minister aims at the appointment of teachers of English in theVernacular schools and the establishment of Central schools to whichselected pupils may pass for continued education. By this means,children of promise from the villages would have an opportunityof entering into the range of occupations in which a knowledge of English isessential. But so far little progress has been made, largely because of theexpense involved. The whole question of future developments in education has been recently examined by a Special Committee, and its recommendationspromise to be a major political issue.*108. Moreover, expenditure on education, though admittedly essential,comes into competition with the demands of other social services. The Govern-menfs resources are limited and the calls on them are heavy. A strong casecan be made out in Ceylon for the health services; but in fact health and education are largely bound up together. The Minister for Education madea great contribution to public health when he succeeded against fierce opposi-tion in introducing a system of school meals for children. The cost of this service, which has been skilfully brought into relation with the Food Pro-duction Campaign of the last two years, has risen from a quarter of a. millionrupees in 1937 to three and three-quarter million rupees in 1944. The Vernacu-lar schools are practically all rural schools and the instruction given in them has a rural bias. It was therefore possible greatly to extend the school gardensand not only to provide a supplement to the Government allowance for schoolfeeding, but also a considerable addition to the general food supply, t109. A limited hospital system had been built up in Ceylon before the inauguration of the Donoughmore Constitution. Prior to 1931 the expenditurehad for two or three years reached the ten million rupees level. There wasin fact a reduction to about nine million rupees in the years of depressionbetween 1931 and 1934, when the malaria, epidemic sent expenditure up toeleven million rupees. It has since gradually increased in the direction of fifteen million rupees, a figure which does not include capital outlay on new,and the improvement of existing, buildings. Year by year a few hospitalshave been opened and central and branch dispensaries and visiting centreshave been provided. But in the years from 1931 to 1944 these have notadded significantly to the total already existing at the beginning of the period.no. Most of the expenditure has been on the clinical treatment of disease.So long as there is such a heavy demand and institutions are under-staffedand under-equipped, tins is perhaps inevitable. The real test of health services, however, is whether increasing attention is paid to research and theapplication of preventive measures. &quot; The future progress, prosperity, andhappiness of Ceylon are more bound up with the eradication of malaria andankylostomiasis /&quot;hookworm) than with politics, transport, agriculture, orany other problem . . . The health and efficiency of the majority of thepopulation are being undermined by these two diseases.&quot;% A survey of theAnnual Reports of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, particularly since the malaria epidemic of 1934-35, reveals that preventive medicine is* Report of the Special Committee on Education (Ceylon) Government Press, Colombo,1943-f The Food Situation in.

playing an increasingly important part in State health activities. The campaign against the malarial mosquito and the hookworm have been actively prosecuted,and a great variety of means have been employed to spread the knowledgeof hygiene and sanitation. Steps have also been taken to provide drainageand prevent soil pollution. The general problems, however, remain formidable-able. Housing conditions, water supplies and proper nutrition urgendydemand attention. The death-rate remains unduly high and the infantmortality/ rate in particular is being only slowly reduced.in. The Donoughmore Commissioners, as we have already mentioned,observed that there were serious gaps in the social structure and instanced the almost complete absence of poor laws, factory laws, workmen&apos;s compensationlaws, etc. Since 1931 practically every device to ensure what is now calledsocial security has been discussed in Ceylon and some of them have beenadopted. The danger has been to overlook the essential differences betweenthe economic structure of the Island and that of a highly developed industrialcommunity. Colombo (population 300,000) is the only large town. Overwide areas a plantation economy prevails and the employers provide housing,schools and hospitals for their work-people. Over still wider areas there arepeasant cultivators who, if they are employed at wages, are casual orseasonal workers. Much social and industrial legislation is therefore inapplic-able in Ceylon.112. The provision of poor relief is a good illustration. -In a country wherethe great majority of the inhabitants are at a level of subsistence and thata comparatively low level the introduction of a comprehensive poor lawsystem is impossible. The main problem is that of raising the standard of life, and the poor law should only be concerned with those who, from somemisfortune or other, fall below that improved standard. The Poor LawOrdinance, 1939, places the burden of the relief of the non-able-bodied onthe local authorities. It covers the usual classes of the aged, the infirm, the sick and children. But while it is intended eventually to apply to the wholeIsland, it is in fact only in operation in Colombo, Kandy and Galle. Theprovisions of the Ordinance cannot be extended to the areas of the UrbanCouncils and Village Committees owing to their lack of funds and the diffi-culties of administration. Thus for the rest of the Island the Governmenthas still to assume responsibility. Its local Revenue Officers, assisted byDistrict Advisory Committees, afford relief where the)&apos; consider it necessary,usually in the form of monthly allowances. Casual relief is also given insudden emergencies, caused by fire, cyclone, flood or other similar cause.The rates of assistance in the case of regular monthly allowances have been recently increased. Expenditure has increased from Rs. 127,525 in 1932 toRs. 1,209,340 in the vote of 1944-45.113. Relief of the unemployed a State liability has not taken the formof direct money payments. The principle of providing work was adoptedduring the depression of 1931. The work was usually the construction of roads, the draining of swamps and similar tasks. The Kottukachchiya StateFarm (Puttalam District) was opened in 1941 with 1,000 labourers from the adjoining areas where there was heavy unemployment in the coconut industry.But in 1942 all relief work was suspended, for war conditions had renderedit unnecessaty. Expenditure on imemployment relief fluctuated fromRs.207,692 in 1931-32 to Rs.674,914 in 1941-42. It must be emphasised,however, that unempkyment in the proper sense can only occur in the townsand on the estates. In the rural areas depression means a lowering of thestandard of life of the peasant cultivator, and the only real solution is to befound in the maintenance of agricultural prosperity. This raises questions of technical   improvements   in   cultivation,   co-operation   in  purchasing  and
&amp;marketing, and since the population is steadily increasing the reclamationof land. *114. An Employment Exchange was set up in Colombo in 1938. It didextremely useful work in enabling the unemployed workers and prospectiveemployers to get into touch with one another until 1942, when the numberof registrations naturally fell off. The registrations in 1938 totalled 29,484;by June, 1944, they had fallen to 329. The Board of Ministers has approvedof the establishment of Employment Exchanges in various parts of the island for dealing with post-war employment problems.115. Reference has already been made to the wide responsibilities ofemployers in respect of plantation labour. Since this labour was largelyimported from India, conditions were laid down by the Indian Government;and these were defined in the Ordinance relating to Estate Labour (Indian),1889, and subsequently amended in 1890, 1909, 1921, 1927, 1932 and 1941.Estate labour enjoys a measure of protection greater than and different fromthat enjoyed by other workers. For the latter the more usual safeguardshave been gradually built up workmen&apos;s compensation, factory legislation and the freedom to form trade unions. Statutory provision for the paymentof compensation to injured workmen was introduced by the Workmen&apos;compensation Ordinance, 1934. The responsibility rests on the individualemployer, who may cover his liability by insuring with an approvedcompany,116. The factory legislation in Ceylon is somewhat fragmentary becausethe conditions which call for it are exceptional. An Ordinance of 1923,supplemented by Ordinances of 1940 and 1941, deals with the Employmentof Women, Young Persons and Children on the lines laid down by the Inter-national Draft Conventions. The employment of any female in manual labourunderground is prohibited by an Ordinance of 1937. The Maternity BenefitsOrdinance, 1939, provides that no woman worker shall be employed for four weeks following confinement, and maternity benefit is payable at the rate of50 cents a day for six weeks. The Legislation already existing calls for adequate inspection to enforce it. There is a comprehensive FactoriesOrdinance, 1942, but it has not as yet been made operative.117. The principle of the minimum wage was introduced in the MinimumWages (Indian Labour) Ordinance of 1927, amended in 1935. It enabled the Governor to appoint an Estate Wages Board in any Revenue district to fix minimum rates for its area. This was confined to the plantations.In 1941 a General Wages Board Ordinance was passed. It authorises theMinister for Labour, Industry and Commerce to establish a Wages board for any trade, with members representing employers and workers in equalproportion. The Wages Board may fix minimum wage rates for time-work or piece-work and its decision is binding on all employers. It may alsofix the number of hours in a normal working day, and specify a weeklyholiday and the number of days for an annual holiday. The Wages Board(Amendment) Ordinance, 1943, gave further powers to&apos; the Wages Board,including that of fixing a basic rate and a special allowance termed &apos;&apos; dearnessallowance &quot; based upon the rise in the cost of living. Wages Boards havebeen set up for the Rubber Growing and Manufacturing Trade, Tea Growingand Manufacturing Trade, the Coconut Trade, the Engineering Trade, the printing Trade, the Plumbago Trade and the Arrack, Toddy and VinegarTrades, t* For a brief description of some of the steps now being taken to reclaim and irrigateland see paras. 151 to 168.I Fuller details will be found in Labour Conditions in Ceylon, Mauritius and Malaya ;Report by Major G.

* Bryce, &quot; Studies in History and Jurisprudence &quot;, 1901.118&quot;. The resume we have been able to give in this chapter of the principalmeasures of social reform introduced under the Donoughmore Constitutionhas necessarily been brief. We trust, however, that it has been adequate to indicate the grounds on which we base our opinion that the grant of universal - suffrage in 1931 has undoubtedly justified itself. It is important to remember that in Ceylon as elsewhere the questions which give rise to political dissension receive considerably more publicity than those on whichthere is general agreement; and though in the course of our review of theunceasing agitation for constitutional reform since 1931 we have expressedOur. opinion that the Donoughmore Constitution had little to commend it,we have thought it wise to bring out in this chapter those features whichwould sustain an opposite conclusion.CHAPTER vii the MINORITIES, 119. &quot;- Institutions must represent or be suited to the particular phenomenathey have to deal with in a particular country. * It is through history thatthese phenomena are known. History explains how they come to be whatthey are. History shows whether they are the result of tendencies stillincreasing or of tendencies already beginning to decline. &quot;*Bearing in mind these words of Lord Bryce, we have dealt in the precedingchapters mainly with the history of the events leading up to our appointment.We now go on to consider somewhat more fully the history and characterof the minorities in Ceylon and the disabilities of which they complain.120. It will have been observed that the relations of the minorities Ceylon: Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Europeans with the Sinhalesemajority present the most difficult of the many problems involved in the reform of the Constitution of Ceylon.The Ceylon Tamils121. Of these minorities, the Ceylon Tamils number nearly 700,000. they constitute a compact and closely knit community dwelling chiefly in theNorthern and Eastern Provinces. As already mentioned, their ancestors were originally settlers from Southern India, but who were first established in the island the Ceylon Tamils or the Sinhalese is a matter of controversyupon which we do not feel ourselves competent to embark. The history of ceylon between the Third Century B.C. and the Seventeenth Century A.D.is largely the history of Tamil invasions and of conflicts between Tamil andSinhalese Kings. But whatever the position may have been in the past,the Ceylon Tamils now form an integral part of the Ceylon people and, sincethe beginning of the British era in Ceylon, have played an important role in every sphere of Ceylonese life. The majority of them are engaged inagriculture, but in spite of their comparatively small numbers they have held their own in the learned professions, in the Public Services and in thecounsels of the Government. In the words of Sir Edward Stubbs (governor of Ceylon from 1933 to 1937), &quot; My predecessors and myself have alwaysrecognised that for the good government of the country the brains and industry of the Tamils were as useful in the past as they would be invaluable in thefuture.   We shall always require their assistance.&quot;122. There are at present eight Elected Members of the State Council&apos; who are Ceylon Tamils.   One of them is the Speaker and another the Ministerfor Home Affairs.
&apos;     139The Indian Tamils123. The Indian Tamil community is of much later origin. These Tamilsfirst came to the Island as labourers on the plantations in 1837, and the systematic recruiting of them began in 1839. Their numbers have tended to ebb and flow according to the economic position of the plantations, andin normal times they move to and from India in a continuous stream.Over a long period of years the planting interests have built up an elaborateorganisation for the importation of this labour and few Indian immigrantscome to Ceylon for work on the plantations, or estates as they are oftentermed, except by this means.Owing to the curtailment of the Census of 1931 for reasons of economy,it is not possible to estimate with accuracy the number of these estate workersnow in the Island; but figures supplied by the Controller of Labour showed the Indian Tamil population on estates at the end of 1936 to have beenapproximately 659,000, including women and children. * In view of, the banon the further emigration of Indian unskilled workers to Ceylon imposed by the Government of India in 1939 (see paragraphs 226-230), this figure isnot likely to have been materially altered and it is probably safe to estimate the present number at between 650,000 and 700,000.124. To the Indian Tamil estate workers there must be added a non-estateIndian population largely Tamils estimated at the end of 1936 to be about200,000. The great majority.of them were at that time employed in govern-ment and municipal service on the docks, harbours and railways, and asdomestic servants, the remainder, being engaged in trade and commerce.125. Accordingly, at the present day, besides some 700,000 Ceylon Tamils,the number of Indians Tamil and others resident in Ceylon can be esti-mated at nearly 900,000. There are considerable bonds of sympathy be-tween the Ceylon and Indian Tamils based on ties of race, religion, cultureand language.126. One Nominated and two Elected Members of the State Council areIndian Tamils.The Muslims (Moors and Malays)127. The Muslim community,! numbering nearly 400,000, is scatteredall over the Island the main concentrations being in the Eastern Provinceand in Colombo, Puttalam, Galle and Mannar. By far the largest portionof this community is descended from Arab merchants and mariners, whovisited and settled in Ceylon many centuries ago. At the time of thePortuguese invasion in the Sixteenth Century these Muslims then as now known as Moors had secured a virtual monopoly of the export and import- trade, and the majority of them are still engaged in trade, though a consider-able number perhaps as many as one-third are occupied as cultivatorsin the Eastern Province.The Moors are a thrifty and industrious people but have, for various reasons, neglected their secular education and have not in that respect keptabreast of the other communities. They are well aware, and so is the Govern-ment of Ceylon, that this short-sighted policy has handicapped their progress,and efforts are being made to remedy the errors of past years.128. A small section of the Muslim community about 18,000 in number is known as Malays. Their ancestors originally came to Ceylon from Java assoldiers in the service of the Dutch, and this may account for the fact that many of their descendants to-day hold positions in the Police force and* Sessional Paper III of 1938.f The term &quot;Muslim &quot; is not an appellation of &quot;race but of a religious community.43668 ,.

on the plantations as superintendents of labour. Although Muslims, the Malaysare distinct from the Moors both in race and language.129. There are three Muslim Members of the State Council, two nominate-ated and one Elected. One of the Nominated Members is a Malay but doesnot represent the Malay community as such.The Burghers130. The Burghers, numbering some 30,000, are descendants of the Dutchcolonists who remained in Ceylon after the capitulation to the British in1796. At first they formed a necessary and valuable link between the new british rulers and the Sinhalese and Tamil inhabitants. Subsequently theyhave played a leading part in the social and political development of the island, filling prominent positions, especially in the medical and legal profes-sions.The spread of education, the closer contact of the Ceylonese with Euro-pean thought and industry, and the more recent growth of national aspira-tions have, as was to be expected, combined to diminish the dominant posi-tion at one time held by the Burghers in the public and professional life of ceylon. Nevertheless, they continue to maintain their identity, and occupyan important place in the intellectual life and Public Services of the Island,enjoying the respect and good will of the other communities.131. The Burghers are represented in the State Council by one NominatedMember.The Europeans132. The Europeans, mostly British, amount to about ten thousand, mainlyplanters, merchants, bankers, business men and civil servants of the higher grades. Most of the planters are employees of Limited Liability companies in the United Kingdom owning tea and rubber estates in various parts of the island; a few of them are proprietary planters.133. The British business community is concentrated in Colombo and has for a long time held a predominant position in the financial and commercialactivities of the Island. The amount of British capital invested in Ceylonis very large, though it has diminished of recent years as the result of the sales of estates to Sinhalese and Indian purchasers.134. The Europeans are represented in the State Council by four nominated members.135. Such are the principal minorities inhabiting Ceylon. Whilst, as wchave said, there are considerable areas in which the minorities predominate,many individuals and small groups belonging to minority communities arescattered throughout the Island, living amicably alongside their Sinhaleseneighbours. Yet when political and social issues arise, the populace as awhole tends to divide, not according to the economic and social issues whichin the West would ordinarily unite individuals belonging to a particularclass, but on communal lines. It is this factor more than any other which makes difficult the application of the principles of Western Democracy to ceylon.136. In a State where political parties are divided on shifting issues of social and economic policy, the party for the time being in a minority tends to think in terms of its eventual return to power, and the part)/ in office, ofthe day when it will lose the confidence of the people and go into opposition.In both parties a sense of responsibility will arise which, on the one handwill prevent the Government from indulging in harsh or oppressive measuresat the expense of its opponents and, on the other, will make the opposition
less prone to detect in measures promoted by the party in power grounds foraccusations of partiality or discrimination.137. Where, however, the divisions are of a more permanent character andare based on such factor-i as race or creed, the normal ebb and flow of publicopinion is lacking, and one section may find itself in the position of apermanent minority. - It is inevitable that such a section, having little hopeof assuming power, will tend to scrutinise with the utmost care everythingthe Government does and will be eager to detect and to stigmatise asdiscriminatory any provisions which appear in the slightest degree to favourone section of the community, even though they may, in fact, be based on sound reasons of public policy. In applying these considerations to Ceylon,it is necessary to consider to what extent the fear of domination and oppres-sion by the Sinhalese majority the main theme of the evidence submittedto us by the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress is justified, and what, if any,steps should or can be taken to remove this apprehension. In the nextchapter, therefore, we shall proceed to examine the allegations of discrimina-tion against the minorities which have been submitted to us.CHAPTER VIIIDISCRIMINATION138. The attitude of the Ceylon Tamils in this matter is epitomised in thefollowing passage from their memorandum of evidence:  &quot; Discrimination against the Ceylon Tamils arises not so much fromlegislative as from administrative or executive acts of commission or omission-sion. The community has been filled with grave apprehension by the cumulative effect of the inequitable distribution of public expenditure andthe manner of dealing with public appointments.&quot;If discrimination is practised against a minority, it is usually by means of administrative actions which are more difficult to detect and expose than arelegislative measures. Apart from enactments affecting immigration and the franchise of the Indian Tamils, with which wc deal later, the Ceylon Tamilscited only two instances of legislation the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance(No. 19 of 1931) and the Anuradhapura Preservation Ordinance (No. 34 of1942).The Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, 1931139. In consequence of the general dissatisfaction felt by the Buddhistcommunity, both priesthood and laity, with the statutory provisions affectingthe administration of the Buddhist Temporalities, an amending Ordinance waspassed in March, 1931, providing that all the revenue and expenditure ofBuddhist Temples should be supervised and examined by the Public Trustee,who was to recover the cost of this administration from the property of theTemples. The Governor was required to make provision for the levying ofthe necessary contributions.By 1933 only a negligible sum had been obtained by way of contributions,and in that year their recovery was suspended by Order and has not yetbeen resumed. Since then, two attempts have been made by the Governmentof Ceylon to get modifications of the 1931 Ordinance through the state council, but without success. Meanwhile, the Public Trustee has continuedto carry on the administration of the Buddhist Temporalities at the public expense.
140. The Ceylon Tamils complain that a total loss of nearly half a millionrupees during the period 1931 to 1943 (the cost of the Public Trusteedadministration) has been incurred by the public revenue, and that,&apos; from year to year,, the general taxpayer is being compelled to pay for the administra-tion of the-Temporalities of a section of the population. This is consideredby the minority communities to amount to discrimination in favour ofBuddhism, the religion of the majority of the Sinhalese.141. Prima facie this contention seems to us to be correct and to affordevidence against the Sinhalese majority in the Council of partiality.The Anuradhapura Preservation Ordinance, 1942142. The purpose of this measure was to preserve the historic city ofAnuradhapura and facilitate the development of a new town outside the zone of its archeological remains. An Estimate was carried in the Council inMarch, 1941, to provide for the services of a Town Planning expert, and inthe autumn of that year the Bill was introduced. It was severely criticised on the ground that the Tamils and Muslims formed a considerable section ofthe population of Anuradhapura (about 10,000 in all) and either owned or occupied the greater portion of the land affected by the measure. The, bill was passed and forwarded for assent to the Governor in December, 1941.Subsequently, the Governor notified the reservation of the Bill for the signifi-cation of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, and on receipt of instructions from theSecretary of State that His Majesty had been pleased to give his assent, itwas proclaimed by the Governor in September, 1942.143. Whether the method adopted by the authors of. this measure is thebest way of preserving the ruins of Anuradhapura we are unable to say. Ourbrief visit to this historic city would not qualify us to express, an opinion; butwe are naturally in sympathy with a measure designed to safeguard the remains of an ancient city ot great extent and beauty. We think that we are entitledto assume that the Ministers have given long and careful thought to this pro-posal, which is in any case in the best interests of Ceylon as a whole, and notto the advantage of any one community; and we are not disposed to ascribeto them in this matter an intention to discriminate against any section ofthe minorities.144. Other cases of legislation were submitted to us by the EuropeanAssociation of Ceylon, to two of which we desire to draw attention the fisheries Ordinance No. 24 of 1940, and the Omnibus Services LicensingOrdinance, No. 47 of 1942. The first of these prohibits any person, excepta Ceylopese or a Ceylon Company, from taking any fish for profit in Ceylonwaters without the authority of a fishing licence. The second provides forthe revocation of any road service licence issued to a. Company unless atleast 85 per cent, of the share capital of the Company is held by personswho are Ceylonese. &quot; Ceylonese &quot; is defined as a person domiciled in ceylon and possessing a Ceylon domicile of origin.145. Both these Ordinances are regarded by the Europeans as discriminatory.Prima facie that would appear to be their effect and, if so, they are regrettable,even though the number of individuals prejudiced or likely to be prejudicedis very small.Administrative Actions: Trade and Commerce146. It has been the policy of the Government of Ceylon sedulously to foster  the co-operative movement  in  the  Island,   and  as  a  result  of
m lState action this movement has made great strides, particularly sincethe outbreak of war. ., There arose at that time widespread profiteeringin consumer goods, especially food and clothing, and in order to control theprices of essential commodities and ensure that they reached every citizenthe Ceylon Government imposed a State monopoly on imports and encouraged the Co-operative Movement. The great success of this movement has ledto an increase in the volume of Government support and to its extension tothe remotest parts of the Island.147. The All-Ceylon Tamil Congress stated to us that &quot; the practically com-pulsory nature of the application of this movement over the whole Island atState expense cannot be looked upon without serious misgiving &quot;, and deducedfrom this policy a desire on the part of the Sinhalese to cut out the trade ofthe Indians and Europeans. They averred that the Indians had an aptitudefor trade which the Sinhalese did not possess, and that the Government was seeking to employ the machinery and finances of the State to benefit theSinhalese community at the expense of others. V&apos;148. It may well be that the Indians are specially qualified by racial charac-teristics and habits to become successful traders, and have in that respect an advantage over the Sinhalese; but we think that this is a consideration:whichshould not be allowed to militate against the encouragement by the Governmentof co-operative trading. It is of course quite intelligible that Indian and othermerchants including Sinhalese should regard with anxiety and disfavour&apos;thedevelopment of this movement particularly when it is mainly the result of govermental stimulus. Nevertheless, we think that this policy cannot reason-ably be criticised on the grounds of communal discrimination. On the contrary,having visited a number of these co-operative institutions, we are convincedthat they are of great value, not only materially but educationally, to a largeproportion of the poorer inhabitants of the Island, Tamil as well as Sinhalese.Moreover, an important factor in the future success of the Governments agri-cultural policy will be a strong eo&apos;-operative movement among the peasants.149. Similar dissatisfaction with the co-operative movement was expressedby representatives of the Muslim community, who at the same time complainedto us that &quot; cut-throat competition and exploitation from.foreigners, especiallyIndians, contributed towards gradually ousting them from the one professionthey had learnt and carried on from father to son for generations.&quot;Public Expenditure150. Wherever a minority problem exists, it is in the sphere of,public expenditure and in the distribution of public revenue that the minoritiesare likely to be suspicious and sensitive. The minorities of Ceylon are noexception, and we have been furnished by the All-Ceylon Tamil Congresswith data purporting to demonstrate the preference shown by the Governmentof Ceylon towards the Sinhalese community in the allocation of public revenue. and works.Agriculture151. Excluding the estates, it is not too much to say that the problem ofagriculture in Ceylon is the problem of irrigation. Rice is the staple dietof the peasantry and in at least five out of the nine Provinces the success or failure of the rice orop is contingent upon arrangements being made for anadequate supply of water to the paddy fields. But the dependence of the peasants, and indeed of the whole Island, upon the rice crop has been greatlyintensified by the Japanese occupation of Burma, the source of the bulk of&quot;the rice supply to Ceylon. &apos; ., , ....
152. For over 2,000 years Sinhalese and Tamil kings in Ceylon had con-structed great lakes, known as tanks* some of them covering several thousandacres to provide water storage. From time to time these tanks were destroyed by invaders a deadly method of bringing starvation and ruinto the kingdom of an adversary or left in disrepair and abandoned whendistricts became infested by malaria. In recent years much of the agriculturalexpenditure of Ceylon has been applied to the construction or re-constructionof these great works of irrigation. Needless to say, these operations are ofconsiderable magnitude, far beyond the resources of private enterprise. Theywere the work of Kings in the past, and are the responsibility of the state to-day.153. From the beginning of this century up to 1931 about eighteen and a half million rupees were spent by the Government on what is termed &quot; majorworks construction,&quot; i.e. irrigation works maintained by the Government forwhich land-owners are liable to pay irrigation rates. Of this amount, overeight million rupees, or nearly 50 per cent, of the total expenditure, weredevoted to the Tamil (Northern and Eastern) Provinces. The population ofthe Northern Province is estimated, as at 30th June, 1944, at about 426,000and of the Eastern Province at about 235,000, making in all about 661,000or a little more than one-tenth of the total population of the Island.154. In 1931, the estimated irrigable area, Le. the actual rate-payinglands plus lands which could be served by the irrigation works, was 238,000acres, of which about 130,000 acres were in the Northern and EasternProvinces.155. Between 1931 and September, 1943, the expenditure on major worksconstruction amounted to about eleven and a half&apos; million rupees, of whichthe Northern and Eastern Provinces have received rather more than twomillion rupees, or about 19 per cent, of the total; most of the acres renderedirrigable by these works since 1931 were in the Central and North central provinces.156. There was very little public expenditure on minor works, i.e. villagetanks, prior to 1931. Between then and September, 1943, out of a total public expenditure on these works of about three and a quarter million rupees,the Northern and Eastern Provinces account for about four hundred thousandrupees, or 12^ per cent, of the total. In terms of acreage served by the villageworks (about 212,000 acres), 14,500 or about 7 per cent, of the total werein these two Provinces.157. The question now arises whether these figures can reasonably beheld to indicate discrimination against the Ceylon Tamils. We must hereobserve that the seriousness of a charge of discrimination based upondifferential expenditure per head of the population or upon the acreage of areas benefited by irrigation is extremely difficult to evaluate. To assess itsvalidity would involve a detailed investigation into topographical questions,technical problems, the supply of labour and material and so forth, whichwe were unable to undertake. But certain facts and arguments have beensubmitted to us by way of answer to this charge:  (i) Of the estimated area of the Northern Province for which irrigationfacilities have been provided (40,100 acres), only 31,687 acres have been cul-tivated, leaving a balance, of about 8,000 acres for which irrigation existsbut which have not yet been brought under cultivation. The comparablefigure for the Eastern Province is about 24,000 acres.   There is therefore* Some of the larger tanks are marked on the general map at the end of this volume.
45 1^a balance of about 32,000 acres in these two Provinces irrigable and capableof cultivation but not cultivated.It is possible that one of the reasons for the failure to cultivate the avail-able irrigable area to its full extent is lack of labour due to the require-ments of the military authority. But while this area of land remainsunicultivated, the Government may feel disinclined to incur expenditure on further developonjenit.(ii) Considerable works of major irrigation have been carried out in theNorthern and Eastern Provinces since 1931, but expenditure on these wonksnedlther can nor should always be in proportion to the acreage benefited.(iii) To construct a reservoir, a valley, or at least a depression, is needed. The Northern and Eastern Provinces are generally fiat and not therefore so suitable for village tanks as are the North-Central and North-Western Provinces, where most of the village works are situated.We think, however, that this is not a complete answer to the Tamilcontention that expenditure is required, not on the construction of newvillage tanks, but on the repair and restoration of those already in exist-ence.(iv) On the basis of pub he expenditure per head of the total populationof the Island, the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces were very well served in the era prior to 1931 and received a good deal more than their proportionate share of the revenue available for works of irrigation;and though, since 1931, their share has been substantially diminished, it isstill in excess of the per capita ratio.We think that this argument should be qualified by the consideration that a portion of the population of Ceylon resides in areas where thepeasantry is less numerous and the need of irrigation works is smaller.For instance, we doubt whether the population of the City of Colomho(some 300,000 and mainly Sinhalese) should be taken into account in com-puting proportionate expenditure on irrigation. If allowances of this natureare made, the comparison of expenditure on irrigation per head of thetotal population of Ceylon with that of the Tamil Provinces may well showa less favourable result to the latter.   -158. Even so, the fact remains that of an irrigation expenditure of somethirty million rupees between 1905 and September, 1943, over ten millionrupees have been spent in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and com-plaints of special favours shown to these Provinces might well have comefrom other Provinces in the Island. But the sharp decline in expenditurein the Northern and Eastern Provinces since 1931 has, as might be expected,provoked the charge of discrimination to which we have referred.159. We think that the following is the true explanation. It appears tous that prior to 1931 agricultural policy had been largely based on strictlyeconomic considerations, it being held that, in terms of output particularly of rice better results at less cost could be obtained from the Northern and eastern Provinces than from the others. Consequently, a large portionof the available resources was allocated to the construction and restorationof tanks and irrigation in areas most favourable to production and, as a result,agricultural conditions there and particularly in the Eastern Province whereafforestation has also been carried out on an extensive scale compare in ouropinion favourably with conditions in the Sinhalese Provinces such as theNorth-Central, the North-Western and the Southern.160. 1931, the first year of the State Council, coincided with a year of severe financial stringency, and a sub-committee of the Executive Committeeof the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands was appointed to. consider measures
of reorganisation and retrenchment. This sub-committee recommended! thatthe principal activities of the Irrigation Department should be directed to therestoration and improvement of the village irrigation works throughout the island, and that the development- of existing major works should be under-taken only to meet the actual demand (as opposed to the possible speculativedemand) for irrigable land. The recommendation was accepted, but it isclear to us that this policy was designed to meet a period of financial stressand was not a policy to be pursued at all times and in all circumstances.When conditions improved and more funds became available, the ExecutiveCommittee took steps to formulate a long-range policy in the matter of landdevelopment and in the extension of irrigation and agriculture. It shouldhere be remembered that under the Constitution then and now in operation,the responsibility for agricultural policy is shared between the Minister for agriculture and the members of the Executive Committee, which may includeState Councillors belonging to any racial group in the Island.161. Within a few years of 1931 a vigorous campaign was started to improve the state of agriculture in the more backward areas, to&quot; arrest the drift fromthe countryside to the towns, and to enable villagers to remain on landswhich were fast sinking back into the jungle. That the population of these areas was mainly Sinhalese is, in our judgment, a factor that played littlepart in the formulation of this policy. Indeed, it was endorsed in the state council by a leading member of the Tamil Congress, who warmly eulogisedthe Minister for Agriculture and made no suggestion of discrimination.162. Extensive schemes of colonisation and land development were insti-tuted, numerous experimental and demonstration farms established, and afar-reaching programme for the improvement of livestock set in motion.There were many failures at the start. The pioneer colonists had a hardstruggle and experience revealed the necessity, when a colonist was placed onthe land, of providing him with a complete farm. This involved the clearingof jungle, the ridging and stumping of fields, the construction of a farm house and other buildings, and an adequate supply of planting material, seed,agricultural implements and livestock. All this work was undertaken bythe Irrigation Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, in addition to theprovision of irrigation facilities.163. It should also be noted that it is part of this policy to encourage mixedfarming. The colonist is no longer dependent entirely upon the cultivation office, as his farm consists of a mixture of paddy land and high land, thelatter being in many cases suitable for the growing of citrus fruits.164. In view of the criticisms expressed by representatives of the northern and Eastern Provinces, we are glad to have been able to see for ourselvesa number of these colonies, farming institutions and cattle breeding stations,and to inspect the provisions made for agricultural education and training.It is no part of our duty to report upon the agricultural development of the island, but we cannot refrain from expressing our admiration for the immense efforts which have been made and the results already achieved, inspite of the lack of staff, plant and material due to the exigencies of war.165. The policy which is being pursued is a long-term one.   The CeylonTamil witnesses have criticised it on two grounds: (i) that at a time when the. cessation of imports of rice from Burma madethe cultivation of home-grown rice exceptionally important, public fundswere devoted to schemes -which would not materially augment the ricesupply for many years.
We think that this criticism overlooks the fact that the policy was forrnul ilated and put into practice some years before the outbreak of war with japan, and that to have abandoned it and switched over at a momentsnotice to a short-term programme would have been very difficult, if not impossible;(ii) that, confronted with the alternatives of opening out and developingland in the jungle and settling on it a population moved from other areas,or of extending the cultivation under village irrigation works, the consolida-tion of areas already developed in the villages and their improvement byintensive methods, the Government was ill-advised in adopting the first alternative and concentrating their efforts on the major works instead ofthe minor.Here again, we think that it has escaped the notice of the critics thatit is only since 1931 that appreciable sums of public money have beendevoted to village tanks. Before that date, public expenditure on theseminor works was relatively small. The amount now spent on the annualmaintenance of these works exceeds the annual expenditure upon theirconstruction at the time when the Minister for Agriculture first assumedoffice.166: In view of the relatively limited resources at the command of theGovernment, it was inevitable that the larger proportion of public revenuedevoted to irrigation works in the Sinhalese Provinces during the last decadeshould have involved a considerable diversion of funds otherwise availableto the Northern and Eastern Provinces. But there is much to be said for the argument that the restoration of agriculture in the Sinhalese Provinces waslong overdue and that the Governments policy was an endeavour to make good the neglect of past generations and to base public expenditure on theneeds of the locality.167. It is not within our terms of reference to pronounce judgment uponthe wisdom of the agricultural policy pursued by the Ceylon Government, orto make any recommendation in regard to future agricultural policy. but from our own observations and after careful consideration of the whole matter,it would in our opinion be wrong to condemn this programme as discriminatoryor to censure it as an attempt to favour the Sinhalese at the expense of another community. We think that the attitude of the Ceylon Government canbe fairly summed up in a reply given in September, 1944, by the Ministerfor Agriculture to one of the Members for the Eeastern Province:  &quot; Irrigation works are needed and have to be carried out in all parts ofthe Island, and it is not my intention to neglect any Province. All that could be done for any Province we are ready to do. Merely because theother Provinces now receive the attention which they did not get before,merely because we have made the Irrigation Department an &apos; all Island &apos;Department carrying out Island-wide activities, my Honourable Friendshould not think that the Eastern Province is being neglected. &quot;*168. We realise, however, that the concentration of so much effort inSinhalese Provinces is bound to cause disappointment to agriculturalists inother parts of the Island, and we have no doubt that the Government will do everything in its power to allay such feelings. We have been assured that plans and surveys have been completed for a number of schemes designedto benefit the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and that, when more staff,plant and material become available, most, if not all, of these schemes willbe undertaken.   In that connection, we venture to express the hope that the* Ceylon State Council Debates : September 1st, 1944, page 1895.
repair and restoration of irrigation works in the Mannar and Mullaittivudistricts of the Northern Province may receive a high priority we visitedthis area and observed widespread indications of deterioration and decay inthe villages and countryside : and also that the means of communication between the Northern and Eastern Provinces, which in our opinion leavemuch to be desired, should be materially improved.Medical Services169. As we have endeavoured to make clear in Chapter VI, one of themost noteworthy and commendable achievements of the Government of ceylon during the last decade has been the development of the social services,including health and education. But according to the evidence of the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress, out of some twelve million rupees voted fromrevenue and loan funds between 1931-1945 for the construction of hospitals and dispensaries, little more than a million rupees were allocated to theNorthern and Eastern provinces; and out of 130 cottage and rural hospitals,dispensaries and maternity homes established in the Island during thatperiod, only 14 are situated in those Provinces. We are unable to estimate the gravamen of this charge without knowing the size of the various institutionsor being able to compare the respective needs of the other Provinces.170. Without doubt the Island was, prior to 1931, woefully deficient in health services, and since then the Government has continued to makestrenuous efforts to overtake the lack of these facilities. We visited, a numberof hospitals and maternity homes in various parts of Ceylon and, with theexception of one in the Mullaittivu district of the Northern Province, to whichwe,drew the attention of the Government, we were favourably impressed.171. It seemed to&apos; us that in the district of Jaffna the major part of themedical treatment available was provided by voluntary hospitals founded andconducted by the American Missionary Society. It may be that the absenceof similar private provision elsewhere accounts for the larger proportion ofpublic expenditure on the construction of hospitals, etc.,- in the rest of the island, but from the information at our disposal we are unable ;to endorse the charge of discrimination against the Government in this regard, and we see no reason to suppose that in the allocation of public funds to these services the Government has been actuated by any other consideration than the needsof the various localities.Education172. Jaffna has benefited for over a century from first-rate secondary schools founded and endowed by missionary effort of various denominations.But the complaint was made to us that despite the immense increase in theeducation vote since 1931, a negligible provision of State schools had beenmade for those parts of the Jaffna district which did not enjoy the benefitof English elementary and secondary education.The figures supplied to us by the Ceylon Tamil witnesses showed that outof more than 4,000 schools established or assisted by the Government duringthe period 1933 to 1942, over 3,000 were Sinhalese and only about 900Tamil, and that whereas in the case of the Sinhalese the Government schoolsexceeded the number of Assisted schools by more than one-third, the Govern-ment Tamil schools were only one-third of the Assisted Tamil schools.These figures indicate an increase in the provision of schools much in excess -of the official figures supplied to us. But in any event, we do not feelourselves able to draw any useful inference from them because we haveno accurate knowledge of the respective educational facilities available to
the various Provinces at the time of the formulation of the Governmentprogramme more than a decade ago. It is, however, generally admitted that for a very long time the provision and standard of education and the degree of literacy among the Ceylon Tamils have been markedly superior to that possessed by the rest of the Island; and as will be seen shortlystriking evidence of that fact is furnished by the number of Ceylon Tamilswho gain admission by competitive examination to the Public Services.173. Accordingly, as in the case of agriculture and health, we are moredisposed to attribute the discrepancies in expenditure and disproportionateallocations of public funds of which complaint is made, to the Governmenfsdesire to redeem certain localities and communities from the neglect of pastyears than to any deliberate partiality towards racial or religious interests.Education among the Muslims, for instance, has in the past, for various reasons, been relatively backward. We were much impressed by the efforts of the Minister for Education,, himself a Sinhalese and a Buddhist, to promote the educational advance of this community.Public Appointments174. We received from the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress complaints of dis-crimination against the members of their community in regard to appointmentsin the Public Services. This matter provides a common source of dissensionbetween majority and minority communities, but in this case the complaintdid not, as might have been expected, disclose that the proportion of postsheld by the Ceylon Tamils was smaller than the size of their community would justify. On the contrary, the Ceylon Tamils appear, at any rate as late as 1938, to have occupied a disproportionate number of posts inthe Public Services. In that year a reply to a request from a SinhaleseMember for a statement giving the racial strength of the officers of thevarious Departments of Government, including the Public Works Department,showed that of 6,002 pensionable officers, 3,236 were Sinhalese and 1,164Ceylon Tamils. If these posts had been allotted in proportion to the popula-tion of each community, the share of the Ceylon Tamils would have been about 600. That they have won for themselves a much larger share is a consequence of the higher standard of literacy and education which thiscommunity has so long enjoyed, and of its energy and efficiency. For similar reasons, the Burghers have achieved an even more remarkable position, forwith-a population of some 30,000 they held in 1938 769 pensionable posts.175. It does, however, appear that what was described to us as &quot; the pre-&apos;ponderant position occupied by the Tamils in the Public Services, especially inthe clerical services by the open competitive examination &quot; is now beingchallenged by competition from the Sinhalese. The Tamil witnesses maintained that in order to improve the chances of Sinhalese candidates, various smallchanges in examination syllabuses and conditions of entry have been made as aresult of the intervention of Sinhalese Ministers, who have also endeavoured invarious ways to use their influence, e.g. with Selection Boards, to favour candi-dates of their own race. One of the examples cited to us was that before 1931arithmetic was a compulsory subject for the General Clerical Services examin-ation. But after the introduction of the Donoughmore Constitution in that yearthis subject was deleted from the list of compulsory subjects because the well-known aptitude of the Tamils for mathematics was thought to give them an advantage in it over their competitors of other races.176. It appears to us that there have been minor instances of this kind of discriminatory action by the Sinhalese, and there can be no doubi that ministers have used their influence, as is too often the custom in the East, insupport of candidates for public appointments where they could.    But it
so would not in our opinion &apos;be right to regard the Sinhalese challenge to the predominant position of the -Tamils in public appointments as based on suchsmall acts of discrimination; rather is it the natural effect *of the spread ofeducation and of the efforts being made to bring other portions of the Islandup to the intellectual level of one portion of it. Our recommendations asregards the Public Services Commission should, if fully carried into effectsecure that in future strict impartiality will prevail in all matters affectingPublic Appointments.In this connection, we cannot help recalling a period in our own historywhen, as the result of the superior educational facilities and better teachingprevalent in Scotland, a minority was enabled to secure a larger share of administrative and executive posts in the United Kingdom than could havebeen justified on any proportional allocation. Since then the English havemade strenuous and not altogether unsuccessful endeavours to redress the deficiencies of their past.Conclusion177. A careful review of the evidence submitted to us provides no substantialindication of a general policy on the part of the Government of Ceylon of discrimination against minority communities. But when a minority, rightly orwrongly, feels itself to be for ever debarred from obtaining anadequate share of the responsibilities of government, it becomes par-ticularly apprehensive of the actions of what it regards as a permanent andunassailable majorit)/. Such anxiety will not be mitigated by-a prospective increase of the majority&apos;s powers, and as the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress put it,&apos;&apos; The near approach of the complete- transference of power and authority from neutral British hands to the people of this country is causing in the minds ofthe Tamil people, in common with other minorities, much misgiving andfear.&quot;178. We do not ourselves feel that these apprehensions are justified by what has happened in the past, but we realise that they are felt, and we have borne in mind throughout our Report the possible repercussions upon minorityinterests of our recommendations. It wilhbehove the Sinhalese majority totake the utmost care to avoid giving cause for an)&apos; suspicion of unfairnessor partiality. In that regard some of the speeches of Sinhalese Membersdelivered inside and outside the State Council emphasising the solidarity ofthe Sinhalese and threatening the suppression of the Ceylon Tamils strike us as singularly ill-advised.But we are satisfied that the Government of Ceylon is fully aware that thecontentment of the minorities is essential, not only to their own well-being butto the well-being of the Island as a whole. If it were otherwise, no safeguardsthat we could devise would in the long run be of much avail. Nevertheless,until the minorities become reassured or are themselves in a position to assume the reins of office, certain safeguards will be necessary, as indeed is recognised by the authors of S.P.XIV. These safeguards will appear in the various recommendations which we shall make in succeeding chapters of this Report.CHAPTER IX The KANDYAN PROBLEM179. In Chapter VI of their Report the Donoughmore Commissioners con-sidered the special position of the Kandyan Sinhalese and dealt with the seriesof demands generally known as &quot; The Kandyan Claim.&quot; A resume of theClaim and the arguments on which it rests will be found on pages 104-105-ofthe Dor lughmore Report, in Appendix V of which the two principal historicaldocunie :ts the Convention of the 2nd March, 1815, and the Government Pro-
5*clamation of the 21st November, 1818 are reproduced in full. Very brieflystimmarised, the grounds on which the Kandyans base their claim to a special position under the Constitution are these.180. In view of its inaccessible nature and the difficulty of communications,the mountainous interior of Oeylon which forms the Kandyan Provincesretained a position of independence long after the rest of the Island had passed into the control, first of the Portuguese, then of the Dutch, and ultimately ofthe British: and the Kandyan Kingdom finally became subject to the BritishCommonwealth, not by right of conquest as did the remainder of Ceylon, butas a result of a Treaty by which its integrity, liberty, institutions, laws andreligion were to be guaranteed by the British Government, which undertook&quot; . . . to devote Kandyan revenue to the improvement and administrationof the Kandyan Kingdom alOne and to uphold the dignity and power of theKandyans as a nation. &quot;* Everything done since in consequence of theadministrative union of the Kandyan Kingdom with the rest of Ceylon which followed the Royal Commission of 1831-32 has, according to the Kandyanview, been done in violation of the Treaty of 1815: and the subsequent con-stitutional developments up to and including the Donoughmore Constitution of1931, which have taken little or no account of the special position and rights ofthe Kandyans, have amounted to a breach of faith by the British Government.Thus any new Constitution which may be promulgated should, the supporters of the Kandyan Claim consider, be designed to rectify this situation by restor-ing the 1815 Convention as modified by the 1818 Proclamation to its full effect,except in so far as variations from it may be freely accepted by the Kandyanpeople.181. It is scarcely necessary to emphasise that in a historical controversyof long standing like this, there is much to be said on both sides: and while we feel considerable sympathy with a great deal of the Kandyan case, we arealso not unaware of the arguments against the legalistic interpretation of their position upon which some Kandyans are inclined to base exaggerated claims.In any case, we do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by our making an attempt to mediate in this controversy, even if we were com-petent to do so, and we can only reiterate the plea so eloquently advanced bythe Donoughmore Commissioners, that the Kandyans should take refuge inthe past no longer, but should bend :their energies rather towards the realities of the present and the potentialities of the future.182. More important than the fruitless discussion of the rights and wrongsof the legal position which can only be of academic interest, since theKandyan Provinces have now been administered as one with the rest ofQpylon for over a hundred years are the practical issues facing the Kandyansto-day. We cannot doubt from the evidence before us that, especially in thelatter half of the 19th century, the establishment of the plantations reacted un-favourably on the Kandyan landowners. By various means which, to say the least, were prejudicial to the latter, lend was acquired to form largeestates, first for the planting of coffee, and later tea and rubber. The inevit-able backwardness of a hill-country population as compared with its mari-time neighbours was accentuated by the spread of educational, health, agricul-tural and economic facilities through the relatively thickly populated andaccessible low country much earlier and on a far larger scale than was possiblein the interior. The result is that to-day the Kandyan peasantry labour underserious social and economic disabilities as compared with their more fortunatefellow agriculturalists of the low country. Moreover, the plantations estab-lished in their territory, while they deprived the Kandyan peasantry of some* Donoughmore Report (Cmd. 313-1), page 104 (Quotation from Memorial of theKandyan National Assembly).
of their land and resources, brought no direct compensatory benefit in the wayof employment, as for various reasons imported Indian and not local Kandyanlabour was used by the planting industry.183. Thus the Kandyan problem, as we see it, is largely social andeconomic, and its solution will be found not in the restoration under the Con-stitution of a privileged status which may or may not be justified by the 1815Treaty, but in the, removal of the practical disabilities under which theKandyans still suffer as compared with the Low Country peoples, i.e., in the rehabilitation of their peasant agriculture and the improvement of theireducational and health facilities.184. We understand that a proposal has been put forward in Ceylon foran extension of local government activities by the establishment of Provin-cial Councils under whose direction many administrative, social service anddevelopment activities now carried on by the Central Government would belocally controlled within provincial areas. It seems to us that such a system would provide favourable opportunities (given sufficient funds) for theKandyan Provinces to undertake the programmes of rehabilitation and develop-ment work which are required to enable them to regain their ancient pros-perity, and we trust that, whether through Provincial Councils or otherwise,the Government of Ceylon will see its way to provide the necessary funds to augment such local revenues as may be available to the Provincial Councils.185. These are, however, clearly not problems which can be solved by the incorporation of special provisions in the Constitution, and we must leave itto the people of Ceylon, to whom full responsible government in all mattersof internal civil administration is to be granted, to take the essentially adminis-trative measures required to remove the Kandyan grievances. It may herebe mentioned that few, if any, of the Kandyan witnesses appearing before usopposed the grant of further concessions in the direction of full responsible government. To those Kandyans who desire His Majesty&apos;s Government atone and the same time to grant self-government to Ceylon and to stipulatenevertheless that self-government must operate in a particular way to thespecial benefit of one section of the community, we would point out the essen-tial inconsistency of their attitude which is, incidentally, not without itscounterpart among other minority communities. With the best will in theworld we cannot consistently recommend self-government for Ceylon andat the same time prescribe administrative measures for the future Govern-ment of Ceylon to carry out. We can only express the hope that futureGovernments will be able to rise above differences of community and casteand look rather to the well-being of Ceylon as a whole, in which is involved the removal of the disabilities of backward or depressed sections of thepopulation by whatever special measures may be required.186. There are two further matters to which reference must be made inthis Chapter. The first is the question of Kandyan representation in theLegislature. It would seem logical that, since the Kandyans feel that theyhave special problems of their own, they should elect members of their owncommunity to the Legislature who would be in a position to put forward the Kandyan point of view and impress upon the Government the necessityfor special measures to redress Kandyan grievances. Yet the evidence put before us shows that, in the General Election of 1931 16 constituencies withprimarily Kandyan electorates returned, not 16 Kand3?an representatives,but only 10, the remaining successful candidates being non-Kandyans. Inthe General Election of 1936, 8 Kandyans were returned, and to-day thereare 8 in the Legislature. The reason given to us to account for these sur-prising results is that the Kandyan electorate is so poverty-stricken and soeducationally backward as to be easily open to bribery and intimidation.
53 &apos;    129We deal with the question of electoral abuses elsewhere in our Report*; but while we are not prepared to deny that these factors have operated to someextent, we do not think that they explain the success of non-Kandyancandidates whose resources and influence would not be sufficient to indulge in these practices on a large scale. The inference is, we feel, either thatthere are considerable numbers &quot;of Kandyan electors who are indifferent tothe specifically Kandyan programme, or that the quality of the Kandyancandidates is low. Neither argument supports the claim for the reserva-tion of special seats for the Kandyans in the Legislature. The former mightbe taken at first sight to confirm the view that universal suffrage was granted too soon for the Kandyans, yet none of the Kandyan witnesses whoappeared before us favoured the restriction of universal suffrage now thatit has been given, and many seemed to share the view held among large sections of the population that universal suffrage has, on the whole, oper-ated to the benefit of the community in general, and especially of the poorerclasses. Af all events, it is clear that under a Constitution providing for fullresponsible Government in all matters of internal civil administration, thosewho advocate special concessions to the Kandyans must first convince theirown people before they can hope to gain their ends. This is one of thereasons there are many others why we unhesitatingly reject a solution ofthe Kandyan problem suggested to us, as to the Donoughmore Commis-sioners, that Ceylon should be divided into three self-governing States,Kandyan, Low Country Sinhalese, and Tamil, under a Central federal government.187. The second point we wish to mention here is the recommendation ofthe Donoughmore Commissioners that &quot; There should be occasional meetingsof the State Council in Kandy and Jaffna.&quot;t While so far as we are awarethere is nothing in the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, or inthe Standing Orders of the State Council which precludes such meetings, thisrecommendation has apparently never been carried out, no doubt because,however desirable in itself, it has never been a practical proposition. Wetherefore consider that the idea of the Legislature meeting anywhere else thanin Colombo should now be abandoned, for whatever advantages might havebeen claimed for such an arrangement will disappear with the improvements in communications which the post-war era will undoubtedly bring.&apos;CHAPTER XTHE FRANCHISE188. From the preceding chapters it will be apparent that the problem ofthe Ceylon Constitution is essentially the problem of reconciling the demandsof the minorities for an adequate voice in the conduct of affairs so as toensure that their point of view is continuously before the administration andthat their interests receive a due measure of. consideration with the obviousfact that the constitution must preserve for the majority that proportionateshare in all spheres of Government activity to which their numbers and influence entitle them. The distribution of political power between the variouscommunities is determined by the extent of the franchise (with which is con-nected the question of immigration), and by the method of representation.We shall consider these questions in this and the following chapters.* See paras. 243-248. t Donoughmore Report (Cmd. 3131), pages 107-8.
189. To-day the inhabitants; of Ceylon possessing Ceylon domicile of,origin* enjoy universal franchise on conditions similar to those obtaining inthe United Kingdom, i.e., the electoi must be a British subject, 21 yearsof age, and resident for a short and continuous period in the relevantelectoral district. .....190. In 1924 the number of registered electors was 204,997 or 4 per cent,of the total population of five millions. At the date of the first electionunder the Order in Council of 1931, the electorate had increased to over one and a half million, and in 1936, when the second election was held, the electorate was about two and a half million. The registers, as revised in .1940,contained a. total number of 2,635,000 electors.191. This ver)/ large increase in the electorate resulted from the recom-mendation of the Donoughmore Commissioners, which was implemented -withcertain alterations by the Ce3*lon (State Council Elections) Order in Council,1931, as amended by the Ceylon (State Council Elections) Amendment orders in Council, 1934 and 1935. It was the view of certain witnesses that thegrant of universal suffrage to Ceylon in 1931 had been a grave error andhad led to &quot; wholesale corruption, intimidation, sale of ballot papers andthe election of unworthy representatives &quot;, and they were of opinion that,in view of the widespread illiteracy and ignorance of the electorate, literacyor educational tests should be imposed.192. Literacy formed one of the conditions of qualification for the fran-franchise under the Constitution preceding the Constitution of 1931, and the donoughmore Commissioners statedt that the retention of that qualificationhad given them more concern than any of the other conditions relating tothe franchise. After careful consideration, they decided that &quot; literacy shouldnot remain as one of the qualifications for electors at elections for the state council.&quot;^: This recommendation was supported by the Governor, Sir HerbertStanley^ and was subsequently adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, subjectto a modification made by the Ceylon (State Council Elections) Order inCouncil, 1931, which we shall presently describe.Had a literacy test been imposed under the 1931 Constitution, it appears from such figures as are available that about half the electorate would have failed to obtain the franchise. We have not been able to procure any accuratestatistics of literacy at the present time, but, despite the considerable advance in education since 1931, we have reason to think that the proportion of elec-tors, who through no fault of their own ha,ve not had an opportunity of acquiring literac)/. is still very considerable. Accordingly, we share the views expressed by the Donoughmore Commissioners and Sir Herbert Stanley,and are not prepared to impose a qualification which would deny to a largenumber of &quot; humble people the political status of their more fortunatefellows. &quot;II193. Similar considerations apply to an educational test and, in any event,the formulation of tests adequate to secure the object which their advocateshave in mind, and the administrative difficulties of operating them would,in our judgment, be insuperable obstacles to their adoption.194. We are satisfied that, despite the abuses to which we shall refer, thegrant of universal suffrage has been ampfy justified by the considerable* The position of those who do not possess Ceylon domicile of origin will be discussed later.j Donoughmore Report (Cmd. 3131), page S5.X Donoughmore Report (Cmd. 3131), page 87.i Sessional Paper XXXIV of 1929.jj,Donoughmore Report (Cmd. 3131),.page 86.
progress made since 1931 in the sphere of social reform, of which we havealready given an account in Chapter VI. We think it very doubtful whether,on a more restricted franchise, the needs and aspirations of the poorer classeswould have met with similar recognition. Indeed, this was admitted evenby witnesses who advocated the restriction of the franchise and alleged that the evils from which Ceylon was suffering were due to the kind of representativesent to the State Council as a result of the mass vote; for, as one of themremarked, &quot; the type of representative that is returned by the masses will necessarily look after the masses.&quot;195. An ingenious and in many ways attractive scheme of indirect electionwas put before us. Its main object was to obviate the disadvantages occa-sioned by the lack of a party system comparable with that of the UnitedKingdom. The witness who gave evidence in support of it held the view thatthe average &quot;elector in Ceylon, particularly if he was illiterate, lacked the capacity to decide between the rival claims of candidates from distant local-ties and was bewildered by the cries and tumult of a. General Election. Buthe could be depended upon, under a system of indirect election, to choosea worthy person from among those with whom he lived in his village, torepresent him in a College of Electors charged with the duty of selectinga Member of Parliament for the whole constituency. It was therefore pro-posed that the electorates should consist of a number of electoral sub-divisions,each containing about 300 electors and constituted so far as possible in ahomogeneous unit, and that each unit should return one of its members tothe Electoral College.196. The advantages claimed for this procedure were that the memberof the Electoral College would have the confidence of the village and wouldbe of a standard of intelligence adequate to appreciate the merits of the competing Parliamentary candidates, that he would closely reflect the views and inclinations of the electorate, that the voter would be exercising a functionwhich he had the ability to perform instead of being called upon to evaluate the worthiness of persons with whom he was not in contact, that the heatand bitterness of a General Election would find little expression in an ElectoralCollege, and that there would be far less scope for the corrupt practices bywhich Parliamentary elections in the Island had often been disfigured.197. It was made clear to us that the scheme was not recommended as apermanent feature of the Constitution of Ceylon, but chat with the develop-ment of the party system indirect election would give way to direct, and thatit was on the whole more suitable for rural than urban constituencies.198. We agree that there is considerable force in the contention that,pending the emergence of party policies and organisations, the average peasantelector tends to be influenced mainly by his personal knowledge of the candi-date, and that when he finds&apos;himself unable to assess the qualities of a candi-date who is a complete stranger to him, cries of race, caste or religion makea deeper impression upon him than they would in the ordinary concerns ofhis daily life.. 199. After full consideration of its advantages, we do not feel able torecommend the adoption of this system. It might possibly have been appro-priate in 1931, as a preliminary to the introduction of direct election combined with universal suffrage, but after fourteen years&apos; experience of direct electionwe think it would be generally interpreted by the electors as a retrogressivestep and an obstacle to the political advancement of the people.200. It may be true that the peasant, though undoubtedly anxious toreturn a worthy person to represent him in Parliament, is not so capable ofjudging between two or more candidates from far off districts as between one

It may be true that the peasant, though undoubtedly anxious toreturn a worthy person to represent him in Parliament, is not so capable ofjudging between two or more candidates from far off districts as between one
elector and another in its own village. But we are convinced that, with all its difficulties and liability to abuse, the existing system is a better method of preparing both electors and candidates for the eventual emergence of parties and the substitution of social and economic for communal issues.i201. It should also be noted that the scheme for the delimitation of electoraldistricts in S.P.XIV* contemplates that &quot; on the average each constituencywould be about half the size of the present constituencies, but in the lessthickly populated Provinces it would be much less than half.&quot; An alterationof this nature would serve to facilitate contact between the candidates andthe electorate.202. As already mentioned, the recommendations of the DonoughmoreCommission regarding the franchise were adopted&apos;&quot; by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. and translated into the Constitution with certain material alterations,some of which had and still have an important effect on the enfranchisementof a substantial section of the population, namely the Indian immigrantunskilled labourer, for, as will appear later, the questions of immigration and franchise are closely connected.203. The Donoughmore Commissioners recommended that a quakncationof five years&apos; residence in the Island (allowing for temporary absence notexceeding eight months in all during the five-year period) should be introduced in order that the privilege of voting should be confined to those who havean &quot; abiding interest &quot; in the country or who may be regarded as &quot; per-manently settled &quot; in the Island. They described this condition as &quot;ofparticular importance in its application to the Indian immigrant population.&quot;IWhen in 1929 the Donoughmore Report was debated in the Ceylon LegislativeCouncil, the principle of abiding interest and permanent settlement as acondition of the franchise met with general acceptance, but the method ofits application caused acute controversy. . .204. The Indian labourers amounted, with their dependants, to&apos; about900,000, of whom between 650,000 and 700,000 were and still are mainly concentrated on up-country estates in Sinhalese, and particularlyKandyan, areas It was feared that an unrestricted extension of the franchiseto these Indians would swamp the Sinhalese vote in those parts of thecountry; and as Sir Herbert Stanley pointed outj &quot; it is intelligible . . . thatthe opposition to the wholesale enfranchisement of Indians should emanateprincipally from the Sinhalese&apos; community.&quot; Accordingly, the Sinhalesedemanded that the test of past residence formulated by the DonoughmoreCommission should be reinforced by a further indication of intention to remainin Ceylon and become a permanent part of the Island&apos;s population.205. To meet this demand, Sir Herbert Stanley proposed that domicile(either of origin or of choice) should be made the standard test, and thatfor domiciled and undomiciled alike the preliminary requirements should be&quot; British nationality, a minimum age qualification of 21 years for persons of either sex, the absence of mental disability or criminal antecedents, and thecondition of residence for six months of the eighteen immediately preceding the preparation of the register in the electoral district to which the registerrelates.&quot; 5 He was of opinion that under this system practically all Ceylonese,and quite an appreciable number of Indians and a few Europeans wouldbecome entitled to registration.* Para. 7 of the Explanatory Memorandum,f Donoughmore Report (Cmd. 3131), page 87.% S.P. XXXIV of 1929, page 13, para. 32.g S.P. XXXIV of 1929- page 13, para. 35.
* S.P. XXXIV of 1929, page 24, para. 10.X Sessional Paper XVI of 1930.f See para. 41.2o6. For the undomiciled, he proposed two alternative qualifications, either a literacy and a properly qualification as under the 1924-1931 Constitution,or a Certificate of Permanent Settlement, to be granted to the applicant by aduly appointed officer, the condition for the grant being evidence of fiveyears&apos; residence and a declaration either of permanent settlement in the island, or of intention to settle permanently, and a renunciation of any claimto special protection by any Government other than that of Ceylon or to special statutory rights or privileges not enjoyed by other residents.207. We are satisfied from our perusal of the contemporary despatchesand debates, and from evidence furnished to us, that if the qualification ofthese Indian immigrants for the franchise had depended solely on thecondition of five years&apos; residence in the Island as recommended by the donoughmore Commissioners, the Constitution of 1931 would not have beenaccepted by the Legislative Council. This was clearly the conclusion reached by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Passfield) in his reply of10th October, 1929, to the Governor, where he says:  I cannot fail to recognise that, unless some material modification of theproposals relating to the franchise can be announced, the prospect ofgeneral acceptance of the scheme and of active co-operation in its workingif it is put in force is remote. You have fully discussed in your despatchthe main outlines of the controversy which has arisen, and in paragraph 35you submit proposals for modification of the recommendations of theCommission, which appear to me not unfair in themselves and to belikely to command a large measure of acceptance. I propose to adoptyour suggestions under which, subject to special provisions being madefor British subjects not domiciled in Ceylon being allowed to qualify forthe franchise in accordance with the conditions of the present Constitution,domicile should be the standard test for inclusion on the Register. the definition of &apos; domicile &apos; involves legal questions of much difficulty and complexity, and the qualification would hardly be suitable if it stood by itself. The difficulty would, however, be overcome by your proposal thatthe applicant, provided he can furnish satisfactory evidence of five years&apos;residence, should be qualified for the vote on the production of a certificate of permanent settlement granted by some duly appointed officer. I proposethat provision should be made for this qualification in the Order inCouncil. &quot;*- 208. It was on this understanding that the Legislative. Council, by amajority of 19 to 17 votes, f accepted the Constitution of 1931.   The necessary provision for special qualification by literacy and income and property, orby the Certificate of Permanent Settlement, was made in Clauses 8 and 9respectively of the Ceylon (State Council Elections) Order in Council, 1931.209. It should here be pointed out that this modification of the DonoughmoreCommission^ recommendation excited considerable apprehension in India andthat representations were made by the Government of India to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment protesting against any modification of the Commissioners&apos; pro-posals.J His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, replied that they would not feel justified in agreeing to any substantial modification of the proposals, which formed an essential part of the scheme of constitutional reforms accepted bythe Legislative Council of Ceylon, and that these proposals did not seem toHis Majesty&apos;s Government to involve any racial discrimination against Indians,whereas some of the Indian protests amounted in effect to a claim to aposition of privilege rather than of equality.
2io. As a result of the operation of the Ceylon (State Council Elections)Order in Council, 1931, the number of Indians registered as electors in thatyear was about 100,000, as compared with 12,438 registered in the Indianelectorate under the old Constitution an increase of over 700 per cent.211. Succeeding years, however, have not stifled the controversy over thismatter. On the one hand the Sinhalese contend that the Elections Order inCouncil, 1931, was not framed in accordance with the undertaking to modify the recommendations of the Donoughmore Commissioners given to them byHis-Majesty&apos;s Government; and that the administration of it has been contraryto its spirit and intention. On the other hand, the representatives of theIndian community in Ceylon complain of the administrative efforts made toreduce the Indian voting strength, reiterate the protests against the undertaking given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and claim the grant of the franchise tothe Indian community on a footing of equality with the rest of the population.&apos;2i2. Apart from any criticism that might be directed against the drafting of the relevant clauses of the Elections Order in Council, we are satisfiedthat it was intended to carry out the undertaking in question. But the complaint that the Sinhalese make against the administration of the Orderseems to us to rest on surer foundations.213. Since 1931 the number of Indian estate workers on the Registerappears to have rapidly increased. In 1936 the figure was estimated at 145,000and by 1938, out of a total population of about 670,000 Indian estate workers and their dependants, more than 170,000 had been registered as electors; in1939 this figure exceeded 225,000. It is probable that one of the reasonsfor this substantial increase was the anticipation of a General Election in1941 it was subsequently postponed on account of the war and the resultinggreater interest taken in registration by prospective candidates and electors.214. In 1938 representations were made by the Sinhalese to the Governor,Sir Andrew Caldecott, that the regulations governing the Indian franchise hadnot been properly implemented. In his Reforms Despatch the Governorstated that it was not a question of constitutional reform but of tighteningup the procedure and, as such, would receive his careful attention.215. In 1940, the procedure on revision of the registers was altered inregard to. the qualification of domicile of choice* and instructions were given that no facts relating to the question of domicile were to be accepted unless they had been checked either by a Registering Officer or an Enumerator,and no one was ,to be registered who was not orally examined. From 1940onwards the figures of registration of these Indians declined and the number in 1943 amounted to about 168,000 the last available figure.216. A study of the published official reports on electoral revision! since1940 discloses two interesting features. The&apos; first is that about 40 per cent,of the Indians in electoral districts other than Colombo, whose names appeared.in the preliminary list of electors, failed to put in an appearance before theRegistering Officer for examination. Among the main reasons given by theRegistering Officers for non-appearance$ were lack of interest and apathy;a General Election was no longer imminent; a general apprehensiveness thatthe enquiry had something to do with repatriation to India (this was reported as a reason in 1940, but as a result of fresh instructions given to RegisteringOfficers it does not appear to have contributed substantially to abstentionfrom attendance at the enquiries in 1941)$; and reluctance to be specific inregard to future intentions.* Sessional Paper III of 1941.f Sessional Papers III and VII of 1941, and Sessional Paper IV of 1942.J Sessional Paper III of 1941-5 Sessional Paper IV of 1942.
i -    132217. The second feature is that practically all those who appeared for examination and were successful in establishing their claim to registrationobtained their qualification in respect of domicile mainly domicile of choice and only a few hundreds in respect of the Certificate of Permanent Settlement.Considering that this Certificate was devised in order to overcome the diffi-culties and complexities attendant upon application for registration in respectof domicile, it is remarkable that the Indian estate workers have made so littleuse of it.218. We were- informed that one of the reasons was their fear that, by applying for and obtaining the Certificate, the applicants would relinquishtheir right to any protection which they might otherwise expect from their home Government. But whatever the reason, it is apparent that these workers have been disinclined to rely upon Article 9 of the Elections Orderin Council dealing with the Certificate of Permanent Settlement, which was designed expressly for their benefit, and, despite the legal difficulties, have preferred to rely upon Article 7, which confers the franchise on personspossessing domicile of choice, including five years&apos; residence.Although prior to 1940, figures specifying the number of registrationsunder each quahficaJtion for the franchise are not available, we cannot resist the conclusion that, until that year, a considerable number of these Indianworkers were admitted to the franchise under an Article which, if correctlyand strictly interpreted, would have made their admission difficult. That itwas not interpreted in accordance with the intentions of those who framedthe Article is probable, for otherwise it is not easy to appreciate the needfelt for the device of the Certificate of Permanent Settlement, which was introduced to overcome the legal difficulties anticipated an proving domicile.219. The fact, however, remains that since 1940, in spite of the tighteningup procedure, substantial numbers of these Indians have acquired the franchisein virtue of domicile. The published returns of the- registration of Indiansdo not differentiate, except as regards Colombo, between Indians resident onestates and elsewhere. But from a comparison of the returns for twelveelectoral districts comprising a large number of estates, we have obtained thefollowing figures.- 220. The 1941 revision of electoral registers shows that out of some 34,000Indians din these districts whose names appear in the Preliminary Lists of electors, 17,500 or about 50 per cent, presented themselves for oral examina-tion, and of these, about 12,000 or nearly 70 per cent, were registered in virtue of domicile. Tn 1942, out of a similar number on Preliminary Lists,less than 8,000 or about 23 per cent, were orally examined, of whom about ,400 or nearly 60 per cent, were registered. In 1943, the names on Pre-liminary Lists totalled 39,600 About 11,000 or 28 per cent, were orallyexamined, of whom about 7,000 or 63 per cent, were registered.Only about 2 per cent of registrations were obtained by means of the certificate of Permanent Settlement, the remainder being in respect of domicileof origin or of choice principally the latter.221. It is probably safe to say that at least 80 per cent, of the IndiansWhose names appeared in the Preliminary Lists for electoral districts otherthan Colombo were either born in Ceylon or had resided in Ceylon for atleast ten years, and it is not unreasonable to anticipate that in a comparatively short time most of them will, if they take the trouble to appear for oralexamination, be regarded as having an abiding interest in the country, aspermanently settled in the Island and as qualified for the franchise.222. Meanwhile, the decrease in the number of those registered since 1939(from 225,000 in that year to 168,000 in 1943), and the remarkable drop
6pbetween 1941 and 1943 in the number presenting themselves for oral exarriina-tion, may be attributed partly to apathy and ^difference-the General Elec-tion due to be held in 1941 was postponed partly to apprehension occasioned by the new procedure of 1940, partly to numbers of electors having left the^Island, and partly to the ban laid on further emigration by the Governmentof India in 1939-a ban substantially continued to the present day.. Recommendation223. We recommend that universal! suffrage on the present basis shallbe retained.CHAPTER XIIMMIGRATION224. The political status of Indians in Ceylon has become so closely inter-woven with immigration from India that it is desirable to examine this question in some detail, particularly rih view of Article 40 of S.P.XIV which seeks toexcept from the Bills which may be reserved for His Majesty&apos;s assent any bill dealing solely with the prohibition or restriction of immigration into the island.225. Broadly speaking, the subject may be divided into three categories:  (a) Immigration of unskilled labour from India. This constitutes, or atany rate has in the past constituted, a vital element in the economic life of Ceylon, and since the introduction of universal franchise has, by reasonof the number of these immigrants, become an important political factor.(6) Immigration from. India of &quot;traders and skilled labourers. these persons are not so numerous as to constitute a major political problem,but are regarded in some quarters as a considerable menace to Ceylonesecommercial interests.(c) Immigration from the United Kingdom of persons connected with united Kingdom enterprise in Ceylon. Their economic importance is verygreat, but their number is small and is decreasing, so that in their case themain problem in relation to immigration legislation would be the right of re-entry of such persons who were in the Island when such legislationcame into force.These categories are not at present controlled by Ceylon, except as regardsdestitutes and vicious persons, but category (a) is controlled by the Govern-ment of India by Section 10 of the Indian Emigration Act No. 7 of 1922,which provides that &quot; emigration for the purpose of unskilled work shall notbe lawful except to such countries and on such terms and conditions as theGovernor-General in Council by notification in the Gazette of India may specify.&quot;&quot; It is further provided that no such notification shall be issuedunless it has been approved by each Chamber of the Indian Legislature.226. A notification under Section 10 of the Act of 1922, authorising the emigration of unskilled labour to Ceylon, was issued in 1923, and emigrationof. unskilled labour to Ceylon continued under it until the autumn of 1939,when the Government of Ceylon, while giving some indication of their in ten-tions but without affording the Government of India an opportunity to com-ment on their final proposals, began a policy of discontinuance of non-Ceylonese daily paid labour which had been employed in Government Depart-ments. The object was both to Ceylonise the labour force and to relieve unemployment.
6i227. On 1st August, 1939, the Government of India revoked the notification-above referred to and thereby placed a ban on the emigration of all unskilled labour from India to Ceylon, whether employed by the Government or by private employers. An exception was then made only in respect of the families and dependants in India of labourers in Ceylon. This ban has re-remained in force ever since its imposition in 1939, except to the extent thatit was relaxed in 1942 so as to permit the return to Ceylon of Indian labourersthen in the Island who might go to India on or after 1st September, 1942.The object of this relaxation, which was made by the Government of Indiaafter consultation with, but without the concurrence of, the Government of ceylon, was to enable labour then in Ceylon to pay its customary visits toIndia for social and domestic reasons.228. In November, 1940, a conference was held in Delhi between repre-sentatives of the two Governments to settle outstanding differences in con-nection with the franchise, domicile and status of Indians in Ceylon, thecontrol of emigration to Ceylon and other cognate matters, as a preliminary to the examination of trade relations between the two countries. This con-ference was abortive. It broke down on the question of the status of Indianimmigrants then in Ceylon. A period of considerable tension followed duringwhich an Immigration Bill published in-Ceylon in February, 1941, was givenits second reading in the State Council at the end of March, and referred to a standing Committee, where it has remained ever since. The Bill made nofurther progress in 1941 for two reasons:  (a) The ban imposed by the Government of India prevented the immigra-tion of unskilled labour from presenting an immediate political problem tothe Government of Ceylon.(b) An effort was being made to arrange another conference with theGovernment of India.229. At the second conference, which took place in Colombo in September,1941, the two delegations reached agreement on all points, including, inter alia, the Immigration Bill and the questions of franchise; Government employ-ment and re-entry.   Their Joint Report was signed on 21st September, 1941.*230. In December of that year war broke out with Japan. At that timethe Government of India had not communicated to the Government of Ceylontheir decision as to the ratification of the agreement entered into by theirdelegates they were not plenipotentiaries but in February, 1942, the Govern-ment of India asked the Government of Ceylon to agree to postpone negotia-tions until the war was over. According to the Government of India, thatinvolved the maintenance for the period of the war of the status quo as beforethe introduction of the Immigration Bill in Ceylon and the Government ofIndia earnestly trusted that the Government of Ceylon would agree that thatwas the proper course to pursue in the best interest of the successful prose-cution of the war.231. The Government of Ceylon agreed to postponement until conditionsfavourable to the resumption of negotiations should return, f Subsequently,in February, 1943, the Government of India informed the Government of ceylon that they had in effect decided to refuse to ratify the agreemententered into by their delegates. The situation has not materially alteredsince that date. The ban on the immigration of unskilled labour from Indiaremains in force with the modification referred to in para. 227, and the immigration Bill still remains in Standing Committee.* Sessional Paper XXVIII of 1941.f Sessional Paper III of 1943.
232. As already &quot;mentioned, we have found it necessary to describe thiscontroversy at some length for two reasons, first, that it relates to theenfranchisement of large numbers of Indians registered in Ceylon; and,secondly, that it affects the proposals contained in Article 40 of S.P.XIV to exclude from the category of Bills which must be reserved for His Majesty&apos;assent any Bills which deal solely with the prohibition or restriction of immigra-tion into the Island or with the declaration of definition of the rights and privileges of citizenship.233. In view, however, of the inconclusive state of the negotiations betweenthe two Governments, the postponement of further &quot;consideration of thematter during the continuance of the war with Japan, and the possibilityof re-opening conversations before the end of the war, we think it desirableto confine our comments upon the situation which has arisen within narrowlimits and to content ourselves with the following observations.234. Notwithstanding the subsequent refusal of the Government of Indiato ratify the agreement of its delegates, that.Government has admitted thatCeylon has the right to determine the future composition of her populationby the imposition of such restrictions as she may deem necessary upon the entry of newcomers.&quot;* It was on this footing that the Ceylon Delegationentered the conference of September,&quot; 1941. t235- We think that as a general principle it is necessary to concede this right to any country possessing full responsible government in all mattersof internal civil administration, and we are therefore prepared to endorse the proposal in S.P. XIV that the Government of Ceylon should have thepower to prohibit or restrict immigration into the Island and that a bill dealing only with that subject shall not come within the category of bills which must be reserved for His Majesty&apos;s assent.236. We feel, however, that it is necessary to make this qualification.It should not. in our judgment, be competent to the Government of Ceylonto prohibit or unfairly or unreasonably restrict the re-entry of persons normallyresident in Ceylon, at the date of the coming into &quot;force of an Immigration Bill.We recommend that the new Constitution should enable the Governor-General!to reserve an Immigration Bill if in his opinion its provisions regarding theright of re-entry of persons resident in the Island at the date of the passingof the Bill by the Legislature are unfair or unreasonable&quot;.It may be argued that these persons would be protected by Article 3 (1) (d)of S.P. XIV. which proposes to include in the category of Reserved Bills &quot; any bill, any of the provisions of which have evoked serious opposition by anyracial or religious commurnty and which, in the opinion of the Governor-General, is likely to involve oppression or serious injustice to any such com-tcmnity.&quot; We think, however, that it is desirable to make the specific proviso that we have indicated.237. As regards Bills dealing solely with the declaration of the rightsand privileges of citizenship (Article 40 (b) of S.P. XIV), we think that a closer definition of the Bills which the authors of that Paper have in mindis necessary. We do not know what precise legal or juridical significancethey attach to the term &quot; citizenship.&apos;&quot; and it is to be noted that, in the correspondence with the Government of India regarding the negotiations of1 cui. &quot;the Government of Ceylon complained that the Government of India* Sessional paper iii of 1943* Sessional Ps-er XXVIII of 194i-z In any fixture reference in our report to the Governor of Ceylon under a newConstitution we shall describe him as Governor-General. We recommendpara- 34-S; that he shall bear that title.
-    13had substituted &quot; the vague word &apos; citizenship &apos; (studiously avoided by the negotiators in their Joint Report) for the careful categorisation of rights.&quot;*238. To the extent, however, that the &quot; rights and privileges of citizenship &quot;are intended to relate to enfranchisement, we think that it should be withinthe competence of the Government of Ceylon to determine the conditions under which the inhabitants of Ceylon may acquire the franchise. The dutyof the elected representatives. to voice the claims and protect the interestsof their constituents in all matters including &quot; the rights and privileges of citizenship &quot;, regardless of the community to which they belong, constitutes the real safeguard. The franchise itself is only a means to an end, and theend is to give people such a share of political power as may enable them to redress their grievances themselves. But their ability to do this involves the absence of any discriminatory legislation regarding the franchise, and anadequate measure of enfranchisement.239. We therefore attach importance to:  (i) the majority opinion of the Select Committee on Election Law and procedure (S.P. XIV of 1938) that Article 9 of the Ceylon (State CouncilElections) Order in Council, 1931, should remain unaltered;(ii) the declaration of the Ceylon delegates at the conference of September,1941, that &quot; there is a body of Indians in Ce3don who, by birth and by long association have so identified themselves with the affairs of this country that their interests are no different from those of the indigenous popula-tion &apos;&apos;;(iii) the provision of Article 8 of S.P. XIV which proposes to prohibit the Parliament of Ceylon from making any law rendering &quot; persons ofany community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities or religions are not liable, or conferring upon persons of any community or religion any privileges or advantages which are notconferred on persons of other communities or religions &quot;;(iv) Article 3S (1) (d) of S.P. XIV by which &quot; any Bill any of theprovisions of which have evoked serious opposition by an)&apos; racial or religiouscommunity and which, in the opinion of the Governor-General, is likelyto involve oppression or serious injustice to any such community- &quot; maybe reserved by the Governor-General for His Majesty&apos;s assent.We think that the new Constitution should contain clauses giving effectTo these two Articles.240. In view of the ban on emigration imposed by the Government ofIndia in 1939, few of the Indian unskilled workers now in Ceylon can havebeen resident in the Island for less than five years. A large number havebeen born there and, under the new Constitution, it will be within the powerof the Government of Ceylon to regulate further admissions. Consequently,the Government of Ceylon will have the ability, as we feel sure it alreadyhas the desire, to assimilate the Indian community and to make it part andparcel of a single nation. But we must point out that any decision of theGovernment of Ceylon upon the conditions of the enfranchisement of theIndian unskilled workers will have an important effect on our recommendations regarding the terms of reference of the Delimitation Commission proposedin S.P.&apos; XIV and upon our approval of the distribution of electoral districtsoutlined therein.!* See paras: 272-27S above.f Sessional Paper III of 1943, Document 17.     See also para. 242 (ii) below.
CHAPTER XIIELECTORAL ABUSES243. Reference was made at the beginning of Chapter X to various abusesof the franchise which were adduced in evidence as grounds for its restriction.We have gone carefully into a number of instances to which our attention was directed and have studied the proceedings and findings of the BriberyCommission published in May, 1943, $ and have read judicial pronouncementsin connection with various election petitions.Without doubt, serious abuses have occurred, particularly at by-elections,but we are disposed to Ihink that not only their extent, but also their effecthave been somewhat exaggerated. These abuses can be divided into three main categories; the selling of ballot papers, the impersonation of voters, and violence and intimidation.The selling of ballot papers244. In consequence of the low level of literacy amongst a large section ofthe electorate, and the inability of a great many voters to recognise the names of the candidates on a ballot paper, the practice was instituted at the first* See para. 332 (ii) (6) below.I See para. 332 (v) below.I See para. 332 (ii) &apos;(c) below,j Sessional Paper XII of 1943.241. From the chapter in our&apos;Report dealing with that matter, it will beapparent that, if anything in the nature of a harsh or restrictive policy regarding the enfranchisement of Indian unskilled labour were pursued, thebasis of minority representation in the new Legislature would be materiallyaffected and the number of Representatives available to protect the interestsof Indian labour seriously diminished.Recommendations242. We recommend that:  (i) Any Bill relating solely to the prohibition or restriction of immigration into Ceylon shall: not be regarded as coming within the category of bills which the Governor-General is instructed to reserve for the signification ofHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure; provided that the Governor-General may reserveany such Bill if in his opinion its provisions regarding the right of re-entryoif persons resident in the Island at the date of the passing of the Bill bythe Legislature are unfair or unreasonable.*(ii) Any Bill relating solely to the franchise shall not be regarded as coming within the category of Bills which the Governor-General is instructed to reserve for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, f(iii) The Parliament of Ceylon shall not make any law rendering persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities or religions are not made liable, or conferupon persons of any community or religion any privileges or advantages which are not conferred on persons of other communities or religions.(iv) Any Bill, any of the provisions of which have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, in the opinionof the Governor-General, is likely to involve oppression or serious injusticeto any such community, must be reserved by the Governor-General forHis Majesty&apos;s assent, t
*    135General Election and subsequently continued of allotting a colour to a candi-date, and of providing ballot boxes corresponding to the colours.. The voter,illiterate or otherwise, has to deposit his ballot paper in the appropriate boxbearing the colour of the candidate of his choice. The voting is secret becausethe paper is not deposited in the box in the presence of the presiding officer,although he has the right from time to time to visit the boxes in order to satisfyhimself that they have not been tampered with.From the evidence we have heard, we have no reason to doubt that it hasbeen a not uncommon practice for a voter to receive his paper, proceed to the ballot box, conceal the paper in his clothing and, instead of putting it into thebox, leave the booth and sell it to an agent of one of the candidates whoarranges for another voter to put it into the relevant box.245. To what extent this malpractice takes place, we are unable to say, butwe doubt. whether, at any rate in Parliamentary elections, it is or can bein many instances on a scale sufficient to affect the result. Nevertheless, weare satisfied that this form of corruption is practised and we have consideredvarious counter-measures which have been suggested to us. Mostattractive of these is the substitution for the coloured box of a ballot paperbearing the names of the candidates in colour. The advantage claimed is thatthe voter would easily recognise his candidate, by the colour, and after makinghis cross in the appropriate place would put his paper in the ballot box in thepresence of the presiding officer. We were, however, informed by witnesses,upon whose experience and judgment we are -disposed to rely, that a largenumber of voters would be unable.to make a cross in the right place, or indeed,in any place, and that a very high percentage of spoilt papers, anything from20 to 30 per cent., would result. We think that this risk should not be taken and, as it is reasonable to hope that before many years have passed, increasedliteracy will enable the great majority of voters to read the names of the candidates and vote for them in the normal fashion, we think it better not to disturb the present procedure but to rely upon stricter supervision and heavierpenalties in the event of detection.Impersonation246. We are of opinion that the extent of this evil is overstated and, as inthe case of the sale of ballot papers, we think that it can seldom take place toan extent sufficient to affect the issue. The best way in our judgment to defeat this malpractice is to have a larger number of polling booths, if possibleone for every thousand electors, so that the candidates&apos; representatives willhave less difficulty in identifying the individual voter. The smaller electoratesenvisaged in S.P. XIV will help in this direction. It is also to be expectedthat with a return to normality after the war more time and money will be expended on the preparation of the electoral registers, with a consequentialimprovement in their accuracy.Violence and intimidation247. We are convinced that violence and intimidation, especially at by-elections, have been practised to a considerable extent, e.g., at the hearing of a petition arising out of a Parliamentary by-election held in October, 1943,the judge found that at one polling station &apos;&apos; unmitigated hooligans had takenfull control of affairs.&quot;But the prohibition of the Court must be supported by the inhibition of the citizen. Real reform can only come from within, from the electors themselves,and depends on the development of a.public opinion which unhesitatinglycondemns such evils. It is our hope and expectation that the spread of educa-tion, the training of character in school and the increase of political experience
will do more than rules and regulations to create conditions inimical to thecontinuance of these malpractices.&quot; Quid leges sine moribusVanae proficiunt? &quot;*248. The existing provisions in regard to the franchise and election lawgenerally are contained in the Ceylon (State Council Elections) Order inCouncil, 1931. We have studied the report of the Select Committee of theState Council on Election Law and Procedure! and are satisfied that thepresent law requires amendment in many particulars. But we do not propose to make any recommendations in regard to the amendment of thepresent law, for, as we have already indicated (para. 242 (ii) ), we considerthat the alteration of the law concerning the franchise and elections is a subject of internal civil administration and as such a matter for the localLegislature to determine.CHAPTER XIIIREPRESENTATION249. In any country possessing representative institutions and responsible government, the problem of representation is of fundamental importance,particularly when the electorate is not homogeneous but, like the electorate of ceylon, is composed of a number of communities differing from each other in race, -religion, tradition, culture, education, customs, habits and language.It is therefore not suprising that, since 1833, when representation was firstintroduced into the Legislature of the Island, political relations between thevarious communities Sinhalese (Low Country and Kandyan), Ceylon Tamils,Indian Tamils, Muslims (Moors and Malays), Burghers and Europeans, havebeen permeated by pressure from one or other or all of them for increasedrepresentation for the purpose of securing a larger number of seats in theLegislature not so much for the people of the Island as a whole, as for one particular section compared with another. Of these sections, the Sinhalese,constituting about two-thirds of the population, were and are the mostimportant; and of the minorities, the Ceylon Tamils, predominant in theNorthern and Eastern Provinces, rank next in voting strength and influence. ,250. This minority professes to have been reasonably content with itsallocation of seats in the Legislative Council prior to the Constitution of 1931 the proportion of Ceylon Tamil members to Sinhalese varying from 1:2 to2:3; and when, in the Legislative Council of 1912 to 1921 the electiveprinciple was first admitted,&apos; there were 3 Ceylon Tamils to 3 Sinhalese inthe Council. Thereafter, for a period of two years, under the Ceylon (Legisla-tive Council) Order in Council of 1921, as a result of an experiment in territorial representation based on Provincial divisions, the number of Sinhalesemembers was more than quadrupled, while the number of Ceylon Tamilmembers remained the same. The latter protested, and under the Ceylon(Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1923, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsubstituted a scheme of representation which restored the ratio of 1 CeylonTamil to 2 Sinhalese. According to the evidence of the All-Ceylon TamilCopgress. the Constitution which came into being in 1924 functioned verysuccessfully until 1931. It was also pointed out to us that the allocation of seats between the two communities (Sinhalese and Ceylon Tamils) was acceptable to the Sinhalese majority, for in 1925 representatives of the ceylon National Congress and of the Ceylon Tamils entered into a pact by* Horace, Odes III, 24.I Sessional Paper XIV of 1938.
67 -    13which, inter alia, they. agreed &quot;that as regards the Legislative Council the representation of the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces andof the Ceylon Tamils in the Western Province and the territorial representa-tion of the rest of the Island in any future Constitution should be in theproportion of 1:2 as at present.&quot;251. Thus, up to 1931 the representation of the communities in Ceylon wasfrankly communal and, in the view of the Ceylon Tamil spokesman, the donoughmore Commissioners&apos; proposal to substitute a purely territorialscheme of representation was a disaster to the minorities and a political wind-fall to the Sinhalese majority. The scheme recommended by the Donough-more Commissioners as subsequently modified and embodied in the Ceylon(State Council) Order in Council, 1931, resulted in more than doubling thenumber of the territorially elected Members, but left the two Tamil Provinces the Northern and Eastern to return no more,than 7 Members, i.e. thesame number as were returned between the years 1924 and 1931.252.   To-day, the 50 territorially elected Members in the State Council aredistributed as follows:  Sinhalese (Low Country and Kandyan) ... ... ... ... 39Ceylon Tamils ...      ...      ... -    ... ... ... ... ... 8Indian Tamils ...       ...       ...       ... ... ... ... ... 2Muslims ...      ...      ...      ...      .&quot;.. ... ... ... 1so that the pre-1931 ratio of 1 Ceylon Tamil to 2 Sinhalese has been changed to a ratio of nearly 1 to 5 in favour of the latter, who now enjoy a majorityover the combined minorities, including 8 Nominated Members, of 20 in a house of 58.*253. Our attention was drawn by nearly all the minority witnesses tocertain despatches from the lafe Duke of Devonshire (Secretary of State forthe Colonies 1922-24) to the Governor of Ceylon, Sir William Manning, inconnection with the Constitutions of 1921 and 1924, and particular reliancewas placed on the following passages: -Despatch dated ixth January, 1923.&quot; The Ceylon (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1920, under whichthe existing Legislature has been constituted, provides that it shall consistof 23 Unofficial and 14 Official Members. The selection of these 23Unofficial Members has been so arranged that, while every communityshall be represented in the Legislative Council, and while there is a sub-stantial Unofficial majority, no single community can impose its will onthe other communities if the latter are supported by the Official Members.If, on the other band, these Unofficial Members had been elected bypurely territorial constituencies, the Sinhalese community would almost certainly have been a majority (disproportionate even to their numericalsuperiority in some cases) over all other sections of the Legislative Council,including the Government.&quot;Despatch dated 22nd January, 1924.&quot; So long as the several communities in Ce3don remain convinced, asthey appear now to be, of the divergency of their interests in many impor-tant matters, so long must some provision be made for the maintenance ofcommunal representation in the Legislative Council.&quot;* The total number of Members of !:he State Council is 61, but the three Officers ofState have not the right to vote.   The Speaker of the Council is a Tamil.
The All-Ceylon Tamil Congress Scheme254. These passages were cited in support of a scheme for &quot; balanced re-presentation &quot;, submitted to us by the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress and en-dorsed by a number of other minority witnesses. The main purpose of thescheme was to prevent the domination in the Legislature of any one com-munity over another, in conformity with this principle, viz., that no singlecommunity should be able to impose its will on the other communities; andit was proposed that the voting powers in the Legislature should be &quot; based ona balanced scheme of representation that would avoid the danger of con-centration of power in one community but would ensure its equitable, distribu-tion among all communities and the people as a whole.&quot;The All-Ceylon Tamil Congress advocated that, in order to attain this position, the Island should be divided into 100 territorial constituencies for an assembly of 100 members, and that of these constituencies 50 should be de-marcated for the election of members to fill 50 general seats, while the remain-ing 50 should be allocated to members of the minorities (25 to the Tamils Ceylon and Indian-and the rest to the other minorities).It was pointed out in discussion that if 50 seats were assured to the minorities but the remainder left open to anyone to contest, the Sinhalese,who had always been and still were the majority group, might, by the lossof one or more of these seats, be converted into a minority. Accordingly,the scheme was amended to reserve these 50 seats for the Sinhalese in thesame way as the other 50 seats were reserved for the minorities.-255. This scheme has been widely publicised in the Island under the title of &quot; Fifty-fifty &quot;, and the following advantages were claimed for it: -(a) The domination of any particular community in a country with aconglomerate population would be prevented, and self-government wouldbecome a reality for all racial communities in the Island.(6) The minorities would be freed from the feelings of &quot; subservience orfrustration,&quot; which resulted from being heavily outnumbered in the Legis-lature.(c) Purely territorial representation, which meant simply numerical repre-sentation, could only result in placing in power a permanent racial majoritythat no appeal to the electorate was capable of altering. The presentsystem made an alternative Government impossible and consequently hadthe effect of making those in power overbearing and autocratic. &quot; Balancedrepresentation &quot; provided the only corrective.(d) Such a scheme would help to compensate for the absence in Ceylonof any Party system on Western lines.   Where representative governmentwas based, as in the United Kingdom, on the Party system, public opinion and the good sense of the Part)&apos; in power set a limit to despotic action by amajority. The realisation by the Government and its supporters that&quot; the Opposition was an alternative Government ever on the alert and ready to assume power by constitutional means &quot; had no parallel in Ceylon..(e) The scheme contained the seeds of growth and was a natural evolutionfrom the form of government in existence before the Donoughmore &quot; inter-lude,&quot; and a natural extension of past tendencies.256. We are not inclined to agree that the system of representation recom-mended by the all-Ceylon Tamil Congress contains the germs of development,and we do not regard it as a natural evolution from the Constitutions of 1921and 1924. On the contrary, we should describe a system which purported to re-impose communal representation in the rigid form contemplated, as
static - rather than dynamic, and we should not expect to find in it the seedsof a healthy and progressive advance towards Parliamentary self-government.We are of course well aware that, unless and until parties in Ceylon becomedivided on social and economic, in place of racial, lines, a minority will haveno reason to rely on the swings to the right or left that occur in WesternDemocracies and., consequently, will have little expectation of taking over thareins of government. Despite the proposal in S.P. XIV for a re-distributionof electoral districts, which we shall presently examine, we are under naillusion as to the likelihood of a speedy reversal of the majority&apos;s presentpredominance in the Legislature. But it seems to us that under the &quot; Fifty-Fifty &quot; scheme each General Election will inevitably produce a Legislatureof the same complexion as its predecessor, and we cannot recommend astereotyped cast-iron division of the communities from which it would, in our judgement, be very difficult, if not impossible, ever to develop a normal Partysystem. But apart from a general consideration of this nature, we find itdifficult to see how any stable Government could be formed or any head of aGovernment be able either to frame a policy or carry it out in a Legislature soconstituted.257. We think it is highly probable that if the All-Ceylon Tamil Congressscheme were adopted action would be taken by the Sinhalese which would beby no means acceptable to the advocates of balanced representation. In aLegislature composed of 50 Sinhalese and 50 members of the minority groups,the obvious course for the largest homogeneous group to adopt in order to recover its commanding position would be to make a pact with one or other of the minorities say, the Muslims or the Burghers and thereby obtainonce more a working majority for itself. No doubt the result would be advantageous to whichever section of the minorities was induced to co-operate and, so long as the pact endured, the support of the minority group in ques-tion would be made worth its while. But the other minorities would beleft to suffer the feelings of &quot; subservience or frustration &quot; with which,according to the Ceylon Tamil spokesman, they are at present afflicted, andit might well be that the existing majority group, exacerbated by the statu-tory deprivation of its electoral predominance in the country, would be much less inclined than it is at present to pay regard to minority interests.258. This possibility was present in the minds of the All-Ceylon TamilCongress, for their memorandum stated as follows:  &quot; With the minorities as against the majority precariously balanced, anysupporting group will really become the decisive factor. The majoritygroup will naturally be much more cohesive than any other and if it cananyhow attract a single group or a number of individuals from differentgroups of the minorities, it can always retain power. In such a case themajority group and its supporters will become the new oppressors.&quot;It was apparent, therefore, that the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress attachedmore importance to representation in the Executive than in the Legislature.For that reason they claimed that &quot; communal non-domination should betranslated into the Executive; for a balanced Legislature with an Executivethat leaves power in the hands of any one community would be a meredelusion and a snare.&quot;   Accordingly tbey proposed that:  (a) The present method of government by Executive Committees shouldbe abolished and its place taken by a Council of Ministers so composed asto &quot; enable the minorities to take their due share in the government of thecountry &quot;.(fe) The Governor should choose the Council of Ministers in consultationwith leaders of the various communities in the Legislature, but that it
should be provided by Statute that less than half of the members of theCouncil of Ministers should be chosen from any one community.(c) The Council of Ministers should elect one of its members to beLeader of the House.(d) The Governor should have the right to preside at all meetings ofthe Council and the Leader of the House should be Chairman of theCouncil and preside over it in the absence of the Governor.259. These proposals seem to us to be open to grave objection. The resultof the statutory injunction to be laid upon the Governor regarding his choice of Ministers would, according to the evidence given by the exponents ofthe scheme, be that a Council or Cabinet of, say, ten Ministers would consistof four Sinhalese, two or three Tamils, one or two Muslims and perhaps a european or Burgher. Thus, the Sinhalese group would get less representation in the Cabinet than the &quot; Fifty-fifty &quot; system would justify. We think thatany attempt by artificial means to convert a majority into a minority is notonly inequitable, but doomed to failure. We have received no evidence to convince us that such a method would produce the collective responsibilityof the Ministers to the Legislature which the witnesses professed to favour andthe absence of which has proved detrimental to the successful working of thepresent Constitution.260. Our attention was drawn to the Constitutions of the Provincial Govern-ments in India, where the. Instrument of Instructions to the Governor enjoins&apos;him &quot; to use his best endeavours to select his Ministers in the following manner,that is to say, to appoint in consultation with the person who, in his judgment,is most likely to command a stable majority in the Legislature those persons(including so far as is practicable members of important minority communities)who will best be in a position collectively to command the confidence of theLegislature &quot; and to &quot; bear constantly in mind the need for fostering a sense of joint responsibility among his Ministers.&quot; But it was submitted to us that in all cases where, in response to such an endeavour, minority members had been included in the Council of Ministers, they had been selected, not somuch because they represented a minority community as because they wereagreeable to the majority in the Council, and not considered to be likely to givetrouble to their colleagues. The All-Ceylon Tamil Congress maintained thatthe inclusion of minority members in any Council of Ministers or Cabinetwhich might figure in the new Constitution should be mandatory.261. It does not, however, seem to us likely that any Council of ministers or Cabinet formed-under such circumstances would accept collective respon-sibilityfor its actions, nor was our attention directed to any precedent forthe successful working of a compulsory coalition of the nature indicated.But it is not because of the novel character of this proposal that we rejectit: it is because of its inherent defects. For all political experience suggeststhat men will work with other men when they are agreeable to them, or are men of their own choice, or under the stress of very grave emergency,but not otherwise. But co-operation and willingness to accept joint respon-sibility are most unlikely amongst colleagues who are forced upon each other by Statute. We are, however, strongly of the opinion that, until partiesdevelop in Ceylon on lines more akin to Western models, the leader of themajority group would be well advised, in forming a Government, to offer a proportion of the portfolios to representatives of the minorities and, in selectingthose representatives, to consult the. elected members of the group or groups to which they belong.262. We have no reason to suppose that the head of the Ceylon Governmentwould be devoid of the qualities and attributes of statesmanship, and indeed,if the scheme proposed in S.P. XIV for the delimitation of constituencies has
7ithe result which we understand it is intended to have, common politicalprudence, apart from statesmanship, will commend to him the course we havesuggested. For as will be seen later, the additional weightage which it isproposed to give to the minority communities may reasonably be expected to diminish the present disparity between the majority and minority groups; andthe majority group itself cannot be counted on always to remain of the samemind and the same allegiance. There is by no&apos; means complete unanimityamong the Low Country Sinhalese and the Kandyans as to their respectiveinterests and aspirations, and the growth of left-wing opinion already consti-tutes a potential solvent of racial or religious solidarity. -These considerationsmust inevitably present themselves to any Leader desirous of obtaining for hisGovernment a stable and reliable basis of support in the Legislature.263. Considerable stress was laid upon the proposal that the Council ofMinisters should elect the Leader of the House, but it seems to us improb-able that this procedure would promote the choice of the most suitable person,for we think that negative rather than positive qualities would commendthemselves to a bod)/ composed of compulsorily associated elements of thevarious minorities. In any event, as in the case of the Legislature, the largesthomogeneous section in the Council of Ministers would have every inducement to secure support for their own candidate by making a deal with one or more of the minority representatives. We do not favour a system likely to producearrangements of this nature.264. Nor do we favour the suggestion that the Governor should, after con-sultation with the leaders of the minorities, choose the members of the Councilof Ministers and himself preside over the Council. It is not consonant withprogress towards full responsible government under the Crown in all mattersof internal civil administration; nor is it in keeping with the spirit of theDeclaration of May, 1943, which, as it appears to us, involves so far as ispossible keeping the Governor &quot; out of politics.&quot;The Scheme contained in S.P. XIV.265. Under the Constitution in being before 1931, of the thirty-four elected members in the Legislative Council, twenty-three were territorially elected andeleven communally. The Donoughmore Commissioners recommended theabolition of the communal seats and &apos;&apos; consolidation of the people into&apos; a singleterritorial electorate.&quot; They hoped that this alteration would &quot; ultimatelymilitate against the recording of votes merely on communal lines &quot; and they further recommended that a local Commission should be appointed to re-distribute territorial electoral areas on the basis of a population standard of70,000 to 90,000, involving an increase in the number of members in the new council to approximately sixty-five members elected territorially.This recommendation was not fully carried out, for the State Council formedunder the 1931 Order in Council consisted of no more than fifty territoriallyelected members. We are inclined to think that the reduction of sixty-five tofifty was detrimental to minority interests and was a mistake. As will be seenlater, we are in favour of the proposal in S.P. XIV that the new Legislatureshould contain 101 members, of whom 95 should be elected territorially.266. There is, it is true, abundant evidence to show that the hopes of the donoughmore Commission, that communal tension would eventually ^ dis-appear as a result of territorial representation, have so far not been realised.For instance, no Sinhalese has any prospect of election in the Northern and eastern Provinces where the Ceylon Tamils predominate, and in most of theWestern and Southern portions of the Island a Tamil, whether Ceylon orInd&apos;an, has. little or no chance. Language alone is a handicap to such candi-dates, but the electors undoubtedly tend to vote on racial and, to some extent,43668 A 4
&quot;eligious grounds. Many instances have been brought to our attention of un-^difying appeals by candidates for support on such issues, but the alterationfrom communal to territorial representation in 1931 certainly did not originate,and, in our opinion, did not materially increase, communal differences. Theyare of far greater antiquity. But, as might have been expected, the electoralreforms brought out into the open and gave intensified public expression tounderlying and deep-seated communal dissension. This is likely to continuesO long as the electors allow themselves to be more concerned with racial pre-ferences than with their material interests and prospects, and encourage can-candidates to lay stress &quot;upon the former. Indeed the impression we derived from some of the witnesses was reminiscent of the experiences of an envoy sent toreport upon an Eastern country some two hundred years&apos; ago :  &quot; Un bruit se repandit qu&apos;il etait venu pour reformer toutes ces maisons.Aussitot il recut des memoires de chacune d&apos;elles; et les memoires disaienttous en substance; &apos; Conservez-nous, et detruisez toutes les autres.&apos; &quot;*267. But already we discern unmistakable signs of a change in the attitudeof the electorate, brought about partly by universal suffrage and the resultantattention demanded from and paid by candidates to the social needs of theirconstituents, partly by the great increase in the powers of self-government under the 1931 Constitution, and partly by the dissemination of a world-wideurge to provide a better standard of living for the poor and distressed. There aredefinite indications of the growth of a Left Wing movement more disposed to concentrate on social and economic than on communal issues. Neverthe-less, we cannot expect any swift or immediate metamorphosis, and further development of the electoral conscience in this direction will depend largely upon the growth of education and general political experience, until it is fully realised that communal representation, though superficially an attractive/solution of racial differences and to- some extent the line of least resistance,will be fatal to the emergence of that unquestioning sense of nationhood whichis essential to the exercise of full self-government.268. We therefore reject any proposal calculated to reinforce the com-munal basis of election,, and we prefer to develop the territorial method.We think, however, that there is force in the contention of the All-CeylonTamil Congress that territorial representation under present conditions tends to become simply numerical representation, and it seems to us that to that extent, and in the light of results, the recommendations of the DonoughmoreCommissioners have pressed too hardly upon the minorities.269. This is recognised in the scheme of representation outlined inS.P. XIV. Its object is to give additional weightage to the minority com-munities, which it is claimed can ibe attained by giving weightage to area as well as to population. The scheme assumes a Legislature of 101 members,of whom 95 would be elected on a territorial basis and six nominated. it provides for each Province to have one member for every 75,000 inhabitantsand an additional member for every 1,000 square miles of area. It proposes that a Delimitation Commission shall be appointed by the Governor with instructions to divide the Provinces so that each electoral district shall have as nearly as may be an equaj. number of persons; but also to take intoaccount &apos;&apos; the transport facilities of the Province, its physical features and thecommunity or diversity of interest of its inhabitants. . . . This community or diversity of interest may be economic or . . . social. On the average,each constituency would be about half the size.of the present constituencies,and in the less thickly populated Provinces it would be much less than one half.&quot;t* Voltaire :  Le monde comme il va Vision de Babouc, 1.746.t S.P.

270. We were furnished with statistics to illustrate the working out of thischeme, and we investigated it with the assistance of a number of wdtnessefwho came before us.   Its advocates estimate that the result would be thatof the 95 elected seats, 58 would go to Sinhalese candidates and 37 to th-minority candidates (Ceylon Tamils 15, Indian Tamils 14, Muslims 8), makingwith the six nominated seats, a minority representation of 43 in a House o:101.   Its critics and notably the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress-describe thescheme as &quot; a superficial attempt to satisfy the growing feeling behind thedemand of the minorities for adequate representation and electoral self-pre-servation;   .   .  . its only virtue was that the electoral areas of Ceylonwould come into measurable physical proportions.&quot;    It was their opinionthat of the 95 elected seats, the minorities could at the best only secure 29,making with the nominated seats a minority representation of 35.   Theycontended that the Northern and Eastern Provinces should consist of 25 con-stituencies so delimited as to ensure the return of 21 Ceylon Tamil memberaand four Muslims.   The scheme in S.P. XIV proposes 16 constituencies folthese two Provinces, estimated to return 13 Ceylon Tamils and three Muslims.271. in the examination of the scheme in detail, the main objection raisedwas in regard to the instructions to the Delimitation Commission to provide that each electoral district should have as nearly as may be a given numberof persons. It was pointed out that there were Provinces where, on the basisof the seats allotted by the scheme and on- the principle of one seat per 1,000square miles and one seat for every 75,000 population, substantial minoritieswould be excluded from representation unless they reached a figure equal tothe result of dividing the total population of the Province by the number of seats allotted to it. For instance, the estimate of results under this schemeforecasts one seat for the Muslim community, numbering some 21,000 in theSouthern Province, to which 12 seats were allotted. But the populationof that Province was, according to the incomplete census of 1931, 771,000;and on the principle that each electoral district in the Province should have as nearly as may be an equal number of persons, the average population foreach electoral district would be about 64,000.272. It was accordingly argued that there was no possibility under thescheme of providing a seat in this Province for a representative of the- Muslimcommunity. It seems to us that this criticism has some substance, and indeed, in the forecast of results submitted to us by the sponsors of thescheme the exceptional character of three seats, including this Muslim seat, was recognised, although these seats were included in the estimated number of seats potentially available to the minorities. We think that this estimatecannot be upheld under the terms of reference proposed for the DelimitationCommission, *and we are of opinion that the terms should be somewhatmodified and enlarged, so that wherever it should appear to the commission that there was a substantial concentration in any area of a Province of personsunited by a community of interest, whether racial, religious or otherwise, theCommission should be at liberty to modify the factor of numerical equality of persons in that area and make such division of the Province into electoraldistricts as might be necessary to render possible the representation of that interest.273. It was suggested to us that minority representation would be strengthened by the creation of multi-member constituencies on the groundthat the only chance of representation for small minorities depended ontheir concentrating all their strength on candidates of their own choice ina multi-member constituency. It seems to us that it might be advantageous to adopt this method of representation in certain localities, for instance, inthe City of Colombo and possibly in the Jaffna Peninsula, and particularly
*eligious grounds.

It seems to us that it might be advantageous to adopt this method of representation in certain localities, for instance, inthe City of Colombo and possibly in the Jaffna Peninsula, and particularly
where divisions of caste in the same community are prominent. We there-fore propose that the Delimitation Commission should be instructed to con-aider the creation of such constituencies in appropriate areas.274. The forecast of results also indicated 14 electoral divisions in whichthe Indian Tamils, principally estate labourers, would preponderate. Atthe moment they have only two elected representatives in the State Council.We think that this estimate should be accepted with caution, ior it dependslargely upon certain considerations affecting the franchise of those labourers,with which we have already dealt. Subject, however, to those considerations,we agree that a figure approximating to the estimated result could beachieved within the terms of reference which we propose for the DelimitationCommission.275. We admit, however, that this scheme of representation by no meansconforms to the strict canons of territorial election, and that it would not be unfair to describe it as a combination of territorial and communal representa-tion. It should, however, be noted that there are precedents in the develop-ment of constituencies in the United Kingdom, where the boundaries of manyconstituencies appear to have been determined not only by factors of numericalequality, but by geography and the common interests and associations of theinhabitants. Indeed, the British House of Commons took its name from the&quot; Communitates,&quot; i,c. shires and boroughs, and had no reference to popula-tion. At any rate, in the present circumstances of Ceylon we see no satis-factory way of securing a reasonable proportion of seats for the minorities,except by a method which combines territorial and communal elements.But, unlike the scheme of &quot; balanced representation,&quot; the weightage pro-posed in S.P. XIV does not guarantee the return of a candidate belongingto a particular community, and the electorate is free to exercise its own judgement and choose the best candidate irrespective of his race or religion.Yet without doubt it gives the minorities a better chance of representationthan they would be entitled to on a strict basis of population. For this reason,we recommend that the proposal should be given a trial. We are informedthat it is intended to hold the next census in April, 1946. For the purposeof the new Constitution it will be necessary to appoint a Delimitation Corn-mission as soon as possible thereafter.276. Article 12 of S.P. XIV prescribes that &quot; The Governor-General shall appoint a Delimitation Commission consisting of the Chief Justice or a judge of the Supreme Court, who shall bo Chairman, and two other persons who shall not be members of the State Council.&quot; We feel some doubt whether it isadvisable to appoint a member of the Judiciary either as Chairman or mem-ber of a Commission whose findings would inevitably have, far-reachingpolitical consequencies. We realise that the intention is to secure im-partiality, but we should prefer the Governor-General to be unlettered in hisselection of the members of the Delimitation Commission.277. Article 14 (i) of S.P. XIV proposes to appoint another DelimitationCommission within one year after the completion of every census. We agreewith this proposal, but we think that prior to the census following that ofApril, 1946, it would be desirable to set up a Select Committee of the Legisla-ture to examine and report upon the working of the scheme of representationwhich we have recommended, with a view to formulating appropriate termsof reference for the Delimitation Commission due, on the assumption of adecennial census, to be appointed in or about 1956.Note. The figures supplied to us by the advocates of the scheme were the1921 Census figures, being the only figures available to show the distributionof population by race.
Recommendations278. We recommend that:  (i) A Delimitation Commission shall be appointed by the Goveriioi-General consisting of three persons, one of whom shall be Chairman;and that in making these appointments the Governor-General shall act is his discretion avoiding as far as possible the selection of persons connectedwith politics.(ii) The Delimitation Commission so appointed shall divide each province of the Island into a number of electoral districts, ascertained as provided inArticle 13 (2) and (3) of S.P. XIV, but so that, wherever it shall appeasto the Commission that there is a substantial concentration in any area ofa Province of persons united by a community of interest, whether racial,religious or otherwise, but differing in one or more of these respects fromthe majority of the inhabitants of that area, the Commission shall be at liberty to modify the factor of numerical equality of persons in that area and make such division of the Province into electoral districts as may benecessary to render possible the representation of that interest.(iii) The Commission shall consider the creation of multi-member con-stituencics in appropriate areas.(iv) Within one year after the completion of every census, the Governor-General shall appoint a Delimitation Commission composed as aforesaidbut (except 1111 the case of the Commission toi be appointed after the censutof 1946) steps shall be taken before such appointment to review the workingof the scheme of representation which we recommend.CHAPTER XIVTHE LEGISLATURE: THE QUESTION OF A SECOND CHAMBER279. Having expressed our views regarding the franchise and the repre-sentation of the electorate, we are in a position to discuss the form which theLegislature should take, its composition and powers and the qualification ofits members.The question which first presents itself to us is whether the Legislatureshould be uni-cameral or bi-cameral.280. A considerable number of witnesses from all communities advocatedthe creation of a Second Chamber. - The following were the principal reasons give in support of this proposal:  (i) A Second Chamber would serve as a check upon hasty and ill-considered legislation to which a uni-cameral legislature, with a very shortexperience of responsibility and apt to be swayed by strong emotion andexcitement, would be prone. Moreover, in view of the substantial reductionin the present classes of Reserved Bills contemplated by the 1943 Declara-tion such a check would become more necessary.(ii) Persons of eminence and position, with high educational and intel-lectual attainments and possessing notable professional or administrativequalifications, were, under existing circumstances and the prevailingmethods of electioneering, or for reasons of age or occupation, deterred from entering political life. Their services were lost to the counsels ofa nation not blessed with a superfluity of persons of that calibre, and intheir absence the Legislature was not fully representative of the country.
(iii) Urii-cameral government was contrary to the practice of every self-governing member of the British Commonwealth and of most majorStates in the world.(iv) It would be easier in a Second than in a First Chamber to make adequate provision for minority representation.281. All -witnesses were agreed that the number of members in the second chamber should be smaller than that of the First and, on the assumptionthat under a new Constitution the latter would consist of about 100 members,opinions ranged from 30 to 50 as a suitable figure for membership of theformer.282. Divergent proposals were put forward for the election of members tothe Second Chamber, varying from election on a restricted franchise, electionby Provinces on the analogy of election to the Senate in the United States ofAmerica, by electoral colleges composed of local authorities or of associa-tions representing law, medicine, commerce, industry and agriculture i.e.functional or vocational election to partial election by one or other of theabove methods, or by the First Chamber under the system of the single transferable vote, combined with nomination by the Governor, as in the caseof Burma.283. The qualifications suggested were based mainly on educational attain-ments, certain scales of income and property, record of service and experience in public life, education, medicine or law, and on standing and authority in banking, commercial, industrial or agricultural circles.284. The majority of the advocates of a Second Chamber were preparedto reserve to the First Chamber powers of legislation in matters of finance,but otherwise contemplated equal powers for each Chamber, provision beingmade for the solution of a deadlock by the device of joint sittings. A fewwitnesses recommended powers of delay like those possessed by the second chamber in the United Kingdom under the Parliament Act of 1911.285. It would seem that similar proposals were put, for similar reasons,before the Donoughmore Commissioners, though with less unanimity, bui-found little favour with them. The grounds for rejection are set out in theirReport (pages 39 and 40) and may be summarised as follows:  (i) In so far as the proposals submitted to them involved election to aSecond Chamber on a communal basis, the Commissioners were unwilling to retain what they described as &quot; a canker on the body politic &quot; and expressed themselves as unable to appreciate &quot; what useful purpose wouldbe served by its abolition in the Lower and its perpetuation in the upper house.&quot;(ii) They were less critical of election to the Second Chamber on a func-tional or vocational basis, but considered that it would &apos;&apos; serve to perpetuatecleavages in the population which are largely artificial and would, by the identification of different classes with particular interests, obstruct thoseunifying tendencies which it must be the aim of true statesmanship to foster and to cherish.&quot;(iii) In either case and holding that a Second Chamber was always a potential source of friction, they were of opinion that, though inferior in scope and power, it &quot; would neutralise to a large extent the transfer ofresponsibility to* the elected representatives of the people.&quot;(iv) They clinched their arguments against the creation of a second chamber by two considerations -financial and physical. It seemed tothem that the minority communities were mainly apprehensive of financialdiscrimination and that fear of hasty legislation usually meant fear of
n -     1taxation. But as it was impracticable to invest the Second Chamber with powers to initiate, amend or reject measures dealing with finance or taxa-tion, it could afford little or no protection to minority interests against hastylegislation.Furthermore, they had received &quot; weighty evidence &quot; that there was little likelihood of obtaining candidates of sufficient standing or authorityfor election to&apos; a Second Chamber without at the same time impairing thechannel of supply to the Lower. In short, they concluded that a second chamber could not be established without a lowering of the standard and quality of members of the First Chamber and would be a constitutionalluxury which the country could not afford.286. Before we come to our own conclusions and recommendations on thismatter, we propose to examine first the decision reached by the DonoughmoreCommissioners, and secondly the objections raised by certain witnesses who desired the retention of a uni-cameral legislature.It appeared to be the general opinion that the outcome of the efforts ofthe Donoughmore Commissioners to remove the &quot; canker of communal repre-sentation from the body politic &quot; had been disappointing. We are not disposed to disagree, for it is abundantly clear to us that no alignment ofthe communities on party lines has yet emerged to take the place of com-munal division. We do not, however, subscribe to ail the sweeping asser-tions made in evidence as to the extent of communalism, nor do we admit the existence of all the evils that are alleged to result from it. But in viewof the failure to abolish communal representation in the State Council, theinconsistency of its perpetuation in a Second Chamber becomes less apparent.In any event, communalism in a Second Chamber, except perhaps to a limited extent, is by no means inevitable.287. We received no evidence to suggest that the functional or vocationalbasis of election would produce cleavages in the population, or would militateagainst unifying tendencies, and we are not aware that any such consequenceshave ensued elsewhere.288. Whether or not a Second Chamber must always be a potentialsource of friction, we are unable to say. But the fact that a bi-camerallegislature has been established by all the self-governing members of the BritishCommonwealth and most major States in the world suggests that the riskof friction is not widely regarded as serious. And if a Second Chamber weredebarred from dealing with Finance Bills and, in regard to other Bills, wereinvested only with powers of delay, we do not feel that the responsibility ofthe elected representatives of the people need be appreciably impaired.289. The Donoughmore Commissioners thought that the minorities, in theirfear of &quot; hasty legislation &quot;, usually had in mind measures of taxation, andthey took the view, with which we agree, that it would not be practicable to invest a Second Chamber with power to protect minorities in the caseof such measures without giving to it a share in the responsibility for finance.290. But we do not think that the power to delay measures other thanfinancial, and thereby check hasty legislation, should be dismissed as of littleaccount. In any event, it seemed to us from the evidence that the minoritieswere nervous, not so much of the methods of raising taxation, as of distri-buting the proceeds of it; not so much of legislation, financial or otherwise,as of administrative action, e.g. favouritism in the making of appointments to the Public Services and so forth.291. As regards the difficulty of finding suitable candidates for the second chamber without impairing the supply to the Lower, we do not know the
number of members which the witnesses recommended to the DonoughmoreCommission, but we find it very hard to believe that Ceylon is so short ofpersons of standing and ability that not even 30 suitable members could befound for the Second Chamber without detriment to .the quality of the First.Moreover, it was part of the case of those advocating a Second Chamber thatthere were a number of eminent men prepared to play their part in a second chamber but unwilling to encounter the rough and tumble of popular election to the First.292. Some of the mmority witnesses were disposed to be critical of aSecond Chamber, but apparently their attitude was due to the fear that aSecond Chamber might be treated as a substitute in their view, inadequate for increased representation in the First Chamber, which was their maindesire.293, The out-and-out opponents of the proposal produced the following-grounds for their objection:  (a) A Second Chamber was anti-democratic and would act as a check on all progressive measures and would result in the &quot; whittling away of democratic rights already achieved &quot;.(b) Experience elsewhere had proved Second Chambers to be ineffectiveand impotent.(c) In, the words of Abbe Sieves, &quot; If a Second Chamber dissents fromthe First, it is mischievous; if it agrees, it is superfluous &quot;.(d) The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor already con-stituted in themselves a Second Chamber. The Governor&apos;s powers of over-riding the Legislature provided an alternative to a Second Chamber, or.as one witness put it, &apos;&apos; There is an Upper Chamber already existing for usin Whitehall&quot;294. In arriving at our conclusions, we have given very careful considera-tion to three factors:  (i) The prospective changes in the Constitution arising from the greatlyenlarged powers of the Government of Ceylon envisaged by the Declara-tion of 1943, and a corresponding reduction of the powers of the Governor.(ii) The composition and character of the State Council,(hi) The interests of the minority communities.295. Seventeen years ago, in view of the powers of the Governor atthat time, and subsequently under the 1931 Constitution, there was littlerisk of hasty and ill-considered legislation reaching the Statute Book, andthe urge for a Second Chamber was not insistent. But in view of the Declara-tion of 1943 and our proposals, the situation may in due course become very different and we think that a Second Chamber will therefore be advisable hot only to nil the gap created by the diminution of the powers of theGovernor, but as a means of averting or minimising any conflict that might arise between the Governor-General and the Tower House in respect of those powers still left to him.296. Having studied many of the Debates in the State Council, we thinkthat, in the particular circumstances of Ceylon, a Second Chamber can make a valuable contribution to the political education of the general public.As already pointed out, there are in Ceylon, as in other countries, a numberof eminent individuals of high intellectual attainment and wide experienceof affairs, who are averse to entering political life through the hurly-burlyof a Parliamentary Election. But it would be an advantage to the countryto enjoy the services of men upon whom party- or communal ties may be
-    142expected to rest more lightly, and who can express their views freely andfrankly without feeling themselves constrained to consider the possible reper-cussions upon their electoral prospects. In this connection, it may be useful to recall the Observations of Walter Bagehot regarding the Legislature of theUnited Kingdom, &quot; With a perfect Lower House it is certain that an upper house would be scarcely of any value . . . but though beside an ideal tfouse.of Commons the Lords would be unnecessary . . . beside the actual houses revising and leisured legislature is extremely useful. . . .&quot;*297. As regards the minority communities, we have reason to hope that the element of communal representation will not figure largely in the composition of a Second Chamber, and we trust that in the First Chamber an increasein the number of seats, coupled with a fresh delimitation of constituencieswill put the minorities into a better position to resist the domination of whichthey profess to be apprehensive.298. But in any case, a Second Chamber will still be of value to the minorities, for, in the words of John Stuart Mill &apos;&quot;&apos; a majority in a singleassembly when it has assumed a permanent character when composed ofthe same persons habitually acting together and always assured of victory in their own House easily tecomes despotic and overweening if released from the necessity of considering whether its acts will be concurred in by another constituted authority.&quot; Furthermore, we think that those who, rightlyor wrongly, feel themselves menaced by majority action, may regard aSecond Chamber not merely as an instrument for impeding precipitate legisla-tion, but as a means of handling inflammatory issues in a cooler atmosphere.We are fortified in our conclusions by the adoption oi a bi-cameral Legisla-ture in all the self-governing members of the British Empire and in most of thelarge States of the world. The investment of uni-cameral Legislatures withsovereign rights has become the exception and not the rule.299. Thus the balance of argument seems to us to be definitely in favourof a Second Chamber, and it now remains to consider the -number of its members, their qualification, the method of selecting them, the powers to be conferred on their House and its duration.Number300. We agree with the witnesses that membership of the Second Chambershould be substantially smaller than of the First, and we think that it should consist of 30 members.Qualification301. We think that a proportion of the members should be specially chosenon the ground that they either possess a record of distinguished public service or are persons cf eminence in professional, commercial, industrial, or agri-cultural life. We think it both unnecessary and undesirable to impose an income and property qualification.Selection!302. After careful consideration of the various methods proposed to us,we have come to the following conclusions:  (i) We do not favour an election on a restricted franchise, not only because it would involve complicated machinery and administration, but becausethe canvassing and other adjuncts of electioneering inevitable at an election,whether on restricted or universal franchise combined with the distance* Bagehot : The English Constitution, Third Edition, page 107.
8oand difficulty of transport, would in our opinion act as a deterrent tomany suitable candidates.(ii) There is no provincial organisation in Ceylon comparable to theStates of the United States of America, and no immediate prospect ofestablishing one.(iii) There is more to be said in favour of an election by electoral collegescomposed of local authorities. These consist of Municipal, Urban district and. Village Councils. But we think that this method of election wouldnot produce the results we have in mind, for it would tend towards the choice of members on local rather than national considerations. Further-more, as in the case of elections on a restricted franchise, candidates forthe Second Chamber would find themselves compelled to undertake election-eering campaigns.(iv) There is much to be said for election by associations on a functionalor vocational basis, but we think that election cannot be confined to suchassociations, though we propose to make use of their services in a simplerfashion.303. We prefer the proposal that the Second Chamber should be selectedpartly by . the First Chamber by means of the single transferable vote, andpartly by nomination by the Governor-General; and we think that this method would ensure adequate representation of minorities in the Second Chamber.We understand that it has been adopted in Burma with satisfactory results.Powers304. We are not in favour of joint sessions as a means of settling a conflict between the two Houses. Not only do we think that such a deviceis more likely to encourage disagreement than agreement between them, butwe cannot envisage with equanimity a situation in which a measure that has passed the Lower House can be destroyed by means of the votes of theSecond Chamber. We prefer that the powers conferred upon the second chamber should be powers of delay for the purpose of giving time for reflectionand consideration, and we think that these powers should be somewhat similarto those possessed by the House of Lords in the United Kingdom under the parliament Act of 1911.305. We propose that there shall be power to originate Bills other thanFinance Bills in either Chamber. It will therefore be necessary for the Govern-ment to be represented in the Second Chamber, for we are not in favour ofpermitting Ministers who are members of the First Chamber to sit and speakin the Second:Article 45 (1) of S.P.XIV provides that Deputy Ministers not exceeding the number of Ministers may be appointed to assist the Ministers in theexercise of their Departmental and Parliamentary duties. We prefer the term&quot; Parliamentary Secretaries &quot; and we think that not less than two ministers and not more than two Parliamentary Secretaries, if such be appointed, shouldbe members of the Second Chamber.Duration ,.306. Whether the Second Chamber should be coterminous with the First,whether it should be subject to dissolution but at longer intervals than theFirst, or whether, as for example in the case of the United States Senate, itshould not be subject to dissolution, but should renew itself at regular .intervals by the retirement and replacement of a proportion of its members in rotation, are questions of great importance and considerable difficulty towhich we have devoted much time and thought.
307. Since there are in Ceylon, as we have pointed out earlier in this chapter, important sections of opinion both in favour of and against theestablishment of a Second Chamber it is necessary in forming our conclusions to take into account the reactions of each section. If a large measure ofpermanency and therefore independence is given to the Second Chamber, itsopponents will regard it as a constant threat to the First. If on the other-hand the Second Chamber is subject to fear of dissolution and the vagaries of election (at least in so far as a proportion of its members are concerned), itwill fail to provide the safeguard against hasty or discriminatory legislation which is one of the main desires of its supporters. If these considerations are applied to a Second Chamber coterminous with the First, it is apparent that in such a Chamber the fear of dissolution will be strong, especiallyamong the elected members. Moreover, the election of these members, whoform one half of the total personnel tpi the Chamber, will fall immediatelyafter a General Election, i.e. precisely at the moment when political feeling-is at its peak. We consider that a Second Chamber suffering from thesedisadvantages would not commend itself to those who would wish to see init some safeguard against hasty action by the First Chamber.308. On the other hand a Second Chamber having a life of say seven years, as compared with the five year life of the Lower House, might be criticised as having too great a degree of permanency and being too irre-movable to be sensitive to the current trend of political opinion. We aretherefore inclined on balance to advocate the adoption as best suited to the-conditions of Ceylon of the third of the courses we have mentioned, and torecommend that &quot;in a Second Chamber of thirty members, fifteen electedand fifteen nominated, five of each category should retire every three years in rotation, so that once normal working had been established each memberwould sit for nine years. The length of this period would ensure to individual members a feeling of security and of freedom of action and opinion, thissatisfying those who desire a Second Chamber primarily as a safeguardingbody: while on the other hand contact with current political trends andsensitivity to popular feeling would be secured by the renewal of one thirdof the membership every three years, on occasions when, generally speaking,comparative political calm in between General Elections would exist.309. Our proposals for arranging the necessary retirements in the third and. sixth year after the establishment of the Senate and for the filling ofcasual vacancies, are contained in the recommendations which follow.Recommendations310. We recommend that:  (i) There shall be a Second Chamber consisting of 30 members, that itshall be called the Senate, and that its members shall be known as Senators.(ii) 15 of the seats of the Senate shall be filled by persons elected bymembers of the First Chamber in accordance with the system of propor-tional representation by means of the single transferable vote; and 15 shallbe filled by persons chosen by the Governor-General in his discretion.(iii) The minimum age for entry to the Senate shall be 35, and persons- chosen by the Governor-General shall either have rendered distinguishedpublic service or be such persons eminent in education, lav/, medicine,science, engineering, banking, commerce, industry or agriculture as theGovernor-General, after consultation with the representatives of the appro-priate profession or occupation, may in his discretion choose.(iv) The disqualifications for membership of the Senate shall be the sameas those for membership of the First Chamber.
(v) The Senate shall choose one of its members to be President, who shall take precedence as near as may be in accordance with the usages of theUnited Kingdom. During any absence of the President, the Senate shallchoose one of its members to perform his duties.(vi) Not less than two Ministers shall be members of the Senate.   If .Parliamentary Secretaries are appointed, not more than two shall be meim-bers of the Senate.(vii) The Senate shall have no power to reject or amend or delaybeyond one month a Finance Bill; and, if a Bill other than a Finance Billis passed by the First Chamber in two successive sessions and is rejected by the Senate in each of those sessions, the Bill shall, on its second rejection,be deemed to have been passed by both Chambers.(viii) A Finance Bill shall be defined in accordance with precedentsalready existing in the British Commonwealth, and the Speaker of theFirst Chamber shall, after consultation with the Attorney-General, beempowered to certify whether a Bill is in his opinion a Finance Bill.(ix) There shall be power to originate Bills other than Finance bills in the Senate.(x) We recommend that the normal term of office of a Senator shall benine years, but that five elected and five nominated Senators (i.e. one thirdof the total membership of the Senate) shall retire every three years and be eligible for re-election or re-nomination. The identity of the members calledupon to retire at the end of the third and sixth year after the date of theformation of the Senate under the new Constitution shall be determinedby lot. Those persons who are elected or nominated after the end of thethird or sixth year will hold office for nine years and a draw by lot will notbe required after the sixth year. A person elected or nominated to fill acasual vacancy occurring at any time will hold office for the remainder ofthe&quot; term of office of the person he replaces.We make no recommendation in regard to the remuneration of membersof the Senate, but we think that it may be found desirable to provide a salary for the-President.CHAPTER  XVTHE FIRST CHAMBER311. We can now proceed to examine the Explanatory Memorandum and parts II and III of S.P.XIV (Articles 5 to 32). These Articles deal with the parliament of Ceylon, its composition, powers and duration, and with the composition of the Council of State and the qualification and. disqualificationif its members, their privileges and remuneration, the distribution of seats,the procedure of the Council and the appointments and emoluments of its officers.312. In Article 5 of S.P.XIV, it is proposed that &quot; the Parliament of ceylon shall consist of the King and the Council of State; but if Parliamentprovides by law for the establishment of a Senate,-Parliament shall consist,so long as such law is in operation, of the King, the Senate and the Councilof State,&quot; and Article 6 empowers &quot; the new Legislature to establish the senate by ordinary legislation. &quot;*
, 3^3- If this provision were adopted, the establishment of a second chamber, or Senate, would depend on the decision of a majority of the first chamber. We think, however, that it should not be left to the First Chamberto determine such an integral part of the Legislature and we cannot agreewith this proposal.Accordingly, we recommend that the Parliament of Ceylon should consistof the King and two Chambers. We think that the term &quot; Council ofState &quot; is&apos;inappropriate to a First Chamber and we prefer the term &quot; Houseof Representatives &quot;; and we suggest that its members should be known as members of Parliament. Thus the legislative powers of Ceylon would be vested in a Parliament consisting of the King, a Senate and a House ofRepresentatives, which would be called the Parliament of Ceylon. An act of Parliament would be expressed to be enacted by the King by and with theadvice and consent of the Senate and the House of Representatives of Ceylon.314. The scheme of representation set out in S.P.XIV provides for 95 electedterritorial seats and 6 nominated seats, making a First Chamber of 101members. We think that for a population of over 6 millions this is areasonable figure.315. We should like to have been able to dispense with nomination, butin view of the virtual impossibility of fitting the European or the Burghercommunities into the electoral scheme of S.P.XIV, we think that, as at present,the representation of these two communities should be secured by nomination.It was proposed by the representatives of the Burghers that they shouldhave a special electoral roll and that the Island itself should be constituted asingle constituency for a separate Burgher electorate. This was the positionbetween 1923 and 1931. A similar proposal was put forward to us by the europeans. Apparently this method of election is preferred to nomination,because, we were told, the charge was constantly made against nominated members that they were the &quot; hirelings and darlings of Queen&apos;s House,&quot; andthe mouth-pieces of the Governor who nominated them. We appreciate the feelings of the Nominated Members, though we cannot suppose that they take this charge very seriously. But this method of election would beunreservedly communal and, as already pointed out, we desire, so far aspossible, to discourage a revision to communal representation. A similarconsideration applies to the representation of the Europeans. Moreover, asregards the Burghers, the considerable, though perhaps not insuperable,administrative difficulty in determining the composition of their electorateserves to reinforce our disinclination to recommend a separate electorate forthem.316. As regards the Muslims (Moors and Malays), there are at presentin the State Council two nominated representatives of the Muslim community.We hope that as a result of the delimitation of electoral districts to be under-taken by the Delimitation Commission it will no longer be necessary torepresent the interests of this community by nomination to the First Chamber,and that an adequate number of Muslims will find their way to it by theprocess of election. Should our hope, however, be disappointed, it will benecessary to resort to nomination as at present.317. Some of the Malays, purporting to represent the whole of the Malaycommunity, pressed upon us a claim for special representation&quot; in the Legis-lature on a racial basis; others of the same community opposed any separateallocation of Muslim seats to Malays as &quot; inimical to the indivisibility ofIslam.&quot; To this claim we must apply the consideration which has promptedus to reject the proposals for separate representation put forward by theBurghers and the Europeans.
318. Articles 18 and 19 of S.P.XIV prescribe the qualifications for election and appointment to the First Chamber. These Articles retain the provisionsof the present Constitution (Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931,Article 9), with the following exceptions:  (a) Ability to speak, read and write English is no longer required.This is one of the qualifications at present in force and the proceedings in theState Council are invariably carried on ,in English. The presence of aMember unacquainted with the English language and unable to follow or take part in the Debates without the aid of an interpreter would no doubthe a great inconvenience to himself and many of his colleagues. Never-theless we do not feel able to recommend the retention of a qualification whichwould in effect bar the election of a non-English speaking Tamil, Sinhaleseor Muslim, though we do not expect that in practice much advantage wouldbe taken of its abolition.(&amp;) Article 19 (&amp;) aims at tightening up the rule concerning governmentalcontracts in which Members&apos; of Parliament may be directly or indirectlyinterested. (See also S.P.XIV, page 6, para. 16 of the explanatory memorandum).   We think this an improvement on the existing rule.(c) Disqualification on account of imprisonment is to be limited tosentences of three months or longer for certain offences only (mainly ofa non-political character) under the Penal Code, and the period of suchdisqualification is limited to a period of 7 years after expiry of the sentence.(S.P.XIV, Article 19 (d) and page 6, para. 16 of the dixplanatoryMemorandum).Under the present Order in Council (Article 9 (I) (/)), a Member isdisqualified if he is serving a sentence of penal servitude or imprisonment for an offence punishable with hard labour or rigorous imprisonment fora term exceeding twelve months. . We think it preferable to retain the disqualification in this form.Article 19 ,(d) of S.P.XIV goes on to limit the period of disqualificationto a period of 7 years after the termination of imprisonment or the -grantof a free pardon. We think that in the case of a free pardon the periodof disqualification should cease from the date of the granting of it.(d) The provision in Article 19 (h) for the disqualification of a member for accepting a bribe or gratification offered with a view to influencing his judgment as a Member of Parliament is an addition to the existing pro-visions for disqualification. We think this addition desirable but, in viewof the consequence of the State Council (Expulsion of Members) Ordinance,No. 14 of 1943, we propose that provision should be made to secure thatany allowance or other payment made to a Member by any Trade union or other organisation solely for his maintenance should not be deemedto be a bribe or gratification within the terms of Article 19 (h).Subject to the above modifications, we are in agreement with the proposalsfor the qualification and disqualification of Members contained in S.P. XIV.319. We note that in the present Constitution it is specifically provided thata person shall be disqualified from membership of the Council who is not aBritish subject (Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, Article 9 (a)).This provision is omitted from S.P.XIV and we assume the explanation ofthe omission to be that, by Article 18, no person will be qualified for member-ship unless also qualified to be an elector; and by the Order in Council of 1931,Article 6, no person is qualified to be an elector unless he is a British subject.Nevertheless, we should prefer the retention of Article 9 (a) of the Order inCouncil of 1931.
&apos; 14320. Articles 8, io and n of S.P.XIV will be examined in the later chapterof this Report dealing with the powers of the Governor^General. We havealready considered Articles 12 to 16 (Delimitation Commission and Distribu-tion of Seats)*, 17 (Nomination) j and 18 and ig (Qualification)!.As regards duration, we think that, unless sooner dissolved, the House ofRepresentatives should continue for five years from the date appointed forits first meeting, and not, as provided in Article 26 (2), from the date of thelast dissolution of Parliament. With the substance of the remaining articles in Parts II and III we are in general agreement, though they will in ouropinion require extensive re-drafting and, in the light of our recommendations,consequential amendment.Recommendations321. We recommend that: (i) There shall be a First Chamber, consisting of 101 members, and that95 of those members shall be elected and 6 nominated from the european and Burgher communities by die Governor-General.(ii) The First Chamber shall be known as the House of Representatives,and its members shall be known as Members of Parliament.(iii) (a) For the purpose of qualifying for membership of the first chamber, ability to speak, read and write English shall no longer berequired.(b) Stricter rules shall be applied in the matter of governmental con-tracts, etc., in which Members of Parliament are interested.(c) Article 9 (I) (/) of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council,1931, shall be retained, subject to the modifications indicated in para. 318.(d) In the case of a free pardon, the period of disqualification of aMember of Parliament shall cease from the date of the granting of thatpardon.(e) In addition to the provisions for disqualification contained in the ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, provision shall be madefor the disqualification of a Member of Parliament for accepting a bribeor gratification offered with a view to influencing his judgment as aMember of Parliament, provided that any allowance or payment made toa Member of Parliament by any Trades Union or other organisation solely for his maintenance shall not be deemed to be a bribe or gratificationwithin the terms of this provision.(/) Article 9 (a) of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931,shall be retained.(iiv) Every House of Representatives, unless sooner dissolved, shall con-tinue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting.Both iChambers.(v) A Member of either Chamber shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a member of the other Chamber.Sessions of Parliament.(vi) The rules and conventions obtaining in the Uni:ed Kingdom as tothe frequency with which Parliament is summoned, and thd length ofsessions shall be followed in Ceylon, and provision shall acordingly bemade in the Constitution.We understand that this will secure that Parliament must meet every year and that the normal length of a session will be approximately twelvemonths.* See paras. 269-278 above,   f See paras. 315-316 above.   % See paras. 318-319 above.
CHAPTER XVITHE EXECUTIVE322. From Chapters III, IV and V, in which we have described the move-ment for the reform of the Donoughmore Constitution, it will be clear thatthe Executive Committee system has, from its inception and throughout its existence, .been subjected to severe and incessant criticism, culminating in Sir Andrew Caldecotfs Reforms Despatch and reiterated without intermissionor diminution up to the present day. We have received evidence of opposi-tion to this system from all quarters minority as well as majority and weare satisfied that the defects to which we have drawn attention render itdetrimental to good government. In any event, even if we saw our way torecommend its continuance under the present Constitution, we should regard it as quite inappropriate to the new Constitution which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs Declaration of 1943 and our recommendations envisage. We therefore recommend the abolition of the Executive Committee system and the sub-stitution of what is known as Cabinet Government on the general lines proposed in S.P. XIV.323. This recommendation will involve the following changes: (i) The Executive Committees and the Board of Ministers, including thethree Officers of State (the Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary and legal secretary) will disappear.(ii) Their place will be taken by a Cabinet of Ministers.   Articles 43and 51 of S.P. XIV propose &quot; until Parliament otherwise provides &quot; to constitute a Cabinet of 10 Ministers.   We think it is undesirable to determine the size of a Cabinet in a constitutional document.   Circumstances might atany time make it desirable either to reduce or increase the number ofCabinet Ministers, and Parliament would always have the power to acceptor reject any proposal-to create a new Ministry.   One of the members ofthe Cabinet will he the Prime Minister appointed by the Governor-General.Following the constitutional convention applicable in the United Kingdom,the Governor-General, at the conclusion of a General Election, will send forthe person who, in his judgment, is likely to command the largest followingin the newly-elected House, and will invite him to form a government andassume office as Prime Minister.   If he is willing and able to undertake this task, the proceedings normal in the United Kingdom will then ensue.The remaining members of the Cabinet will be appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and the new Govern-ment will meet the Legislature for its approval or otherwise.(iii) The additional Ministers required to replace the Officers of state will assume the functions of those officers, or such functions as may be assigned to them.*324. The Donoughmore Report sets out in detail the various functions which the Commissioners recommended should be assigned to the ExecutiveCommittees and to the Officers of State. These functions were laid down inthe Ceylon (State Council&apos;) Order in Council,, 1931 (First and SecondSchedules), with certain departures from the Donoughmore recommendationsnot in our opinion entirely justified in the light of subsequent experience.Powers were given to the State Council to amend by resolution the first schedule (which prescribed the functions of the Executive Committees) but* See para. 326.
87 -       146not the Second Schedule (which prescribed the functions of the Officers ofState).   Such a resolution required the approval of the Governor.*325. We think that a restriction of this kind would be inappropriate to thenew conditions and would not be consonant with the exercise of &apos;&apos; responsible government in all matters of internal civil administration.&apos; We consider itneither necessary nor desirable that the functions to be assigned to eachMinister should be laid down in the new constitutional instruments. Weprefer the proposal contained in Article 44 of S.P.XIV which ordains thatthese functions shall be determined from time to time by the Prime Minister,subject to the provisions of Article 39. The functions of External affairs and Defence would however fall to the Prime Minister in accordance withour recommendations in the next Chapter.326. We think, however, that it may be helpful to make the following suggestions:- (i) The functions of the Financial Secretary should be transferred to a minister of Finance who, subject to the functions allotted to the public services Commission j&quot; should also be responsible for the Public Services, a function at present shared by the Chief Secretary and the FinancialSecretary.(ii) The functions of the Legal Secretary should be transferred to a minister of Justice.$(hi) The Department of Fisheries should be transferred from the Ministry-of Local Administration to the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.(iv) The function of Poor Relief should be transferred from the Ministryof Labour to the Ministry of Health.(v) The control of Road Transport should be transferred from theMinistry of Local Administration to the Ministry of Communications.(vi) The control of Emigration, Immigration and Repatriation should betransferred from the Chief Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs.(vii) We are doubtful whether in the future the subject of Labour canbe satisfactorily combined with the subject of Industry and Commerce.We recognise, however, that this has been the procedure since 1931, andwe do not suggest an immediate re-allocation, though we think that it maywell be necessary at a subsequent elate to create separate Ministries.In the meantime, it may be thought desirable to lighten the burden ofthe Minister of Labour, Industry and Commerce by the appointment of a parliamentary Secretary.(viii) We are in agreement with the proposal in S.P.XIV that theGovernor-General, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, may appoint Deputy Ministers to assist the Ministers in the exercise of their departmental and- parliamentary duties, but we should prefer the title of- Parliamentary Secretary and we suggest that, in the first instance anduntil further experience has been gained, Parliamentary Secretaries shouldbe appointed to assist only those Ministers whose portfolios are particularlyheavy.Subject to these suggestions, we give our general approval to the proposals contained in Articles 42 to 52 of S.P. XIV.* Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, Section 32, sub-section 2.f See para. 379.j See paras. 393 4
327. Article 53, Sub-Section 2, also proposes a change in the administrationoi Government Offices. At present a Ministry consisting of a number oiseparate Departments (the average is about five) has an official at the headof each, ranking in authority and status as the equal of each of his colleaguesat the head of the other departments of the Ministry. Consequently, the settle-ment of conflicting views amongst these various departmental chiefs, and theco-ordination of the work of their Departments, is in effect thrown upon theMinister. This involves hirn in a great deal of administrative activity fromwhich he should be free, and imposes upon him the task of dealing with manydetails which should never come to his attention. He is in fact not only thepolitical, but also the administrative head of his Ministry not only theMinister, but Permanent Secretary as well.328. The function of planning and co-ordinating the work of various sectionsof a Ministry, filtering material and presenting it- in a form suitable for ministerial decision necessitates the appointment of a high administrativeofficial similar to the Permanent Secretary to a Ministry in the United King-dom, and we are in agreement with S.P. XIV in recommending such appointments.329. We note that it is proposed in S.P. XIV that an officer shall be designated by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the PrimeMinister, to fill temporarily the post of Permanent Secretary to each of theMinisteries. We recommend that normally this appointment should be madeby the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Public Services Com-mission, but we concur in the proposal of S.P. XIV that, in the first instance&quot;,and to cover a transitional period, the recommendations in respect of thePermanent heads of the Ministries should be made to the Governor-Generaloy the Prime Minister.Recommendations .330. We recommend that: (i) The Executive Committees and the three Officers of State (the chief secretary, Legal Secretary and Financial Secretary) shall be abolished.(ii) In place of the present Board, there shall be a Cabinet of ministers responsible to the Legislature of whom une appointed by the Governor-General shall be Prime Minister. The Ministers other than the PrimeMmister shall be appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendationof the Prime Minister.(iii) The functions to be assigned to each Minister shall be determined bythe Prime Minister.(iv) The Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the PrimeMinister, appoint Parliamentary Secretaries, but the number so appointedshall not exceed the number of Ministers.(v) A Permanent Secretary to each Ministry shall be appointed by theGovernor-General on the recommendation of the Public Services Corn-mission.
8qCHAPTER XVII 1 3THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL: POWERS, STATUS AND SALARY331. The Donoughmore Commissioners pointed out that the change whichthey recommended in the power and position of the Governor of Ceylon wouldassign to him an intermediate station between the two extremes of a &quot; con-stitutional &quot; Governor and one of the old type associated with Crown Colonygovernment. Such a change in his position must&quot;in their view accord with the degree to which responsibility was to be transferred, so that his executive powers would be diminished in direct ratio to the advance made towardsresponsible government.Accepting this principle and following the guidance of the Declaration ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government of May, 1943, we shall set out in this chapter thepowers which we recommend should be exercisable by the Governor-Generalunder the Constitution we contemplate.332. Article IV of the Royal Instructions of 1931 specifies seventeen classesof Bills which the Governor is instructed. to reserve for the signification ofHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure. We propose that these classes shall be reduced to seven, namely: (i) Any Bill relating to Defence.(ii) Any Bill relating to External Affairs, provided that Bills of the follow-ing character shall not be regarded as coming within this category:  (a) Any Bill relating to and conforming with any trade agreement con-cluded with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Ceylon withother parts of the Commonwealth.(b) Any Bill relating solely to the prohibition or restriction of immigra-tion* into Ceylon, provided that the Governor-General may reserve anysuch Bill, if in his opinion its provisions regarding the right of re-entry of persons resident in the Island at the date of the passing of the Billby the Legislature are unfair or unreasonable.(c) Any Bill relating solely to the franchise.!(d) Any Bill relating solely to the prohibition or restriction of the ira-portation of, or the imposition of import duties upon, any class of goods,provided that such legislation is not discriminatory in character.(iii) Any Bill affecting currency or relating to the issue of bank notes.(iv) Any Bill of an extraordinary nature and importance whereby theRoyal Prerogative or the rights and property of British subjects not residing in Ceylon or the trade or transport or communications of any part of theCommonwealth may be prejudiced.(v) Any Bill any of the provisions of- which have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, in the opinion of theGovernor-General, is likely to involve oppression or serious injustice to anysuch community.(vi) Any Bill which repeals or amends any provision of the Constitution,or which is in any way repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisions ofthe Constitution, unless the Governor-General shall have been authorised by the Secretary of State to assent thereto.(vii) Any Bill which is repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisionsof a Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance.

CHAPTER XVII A *THE GOVERN OR-GENERAL: POWERS, STATUS AND SALARY331. The Donoughmore Commissioners pointed out that the change which,they recommended in the power and position of the Governor of Ceylon wouldassign to him an intermediate &quot;station between the two- extremes of a &quot; con-stitutional&quot;&quot; Governor and one of the old type associated with Crown Colonygovernment. Such a change in his position fnustfin their view accord with the degree to which responsibility was to be transferred, so that his executive powers would be diminished in direct ratio to the advance made- towardsresponsible government.Accepting this principle and following the guidance of the Declaration ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government of May, 1943, we shall set out in this chapter thepowers which we recommend should be exercisable by the Governor-General-under the Constitution We contemplate332. Article IV of the Royal Instructions of 1931 specifies seventeen classesof Bills which the Governor is instructed , to reserve for the signification ofHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure. We propose that these classes shall ,be reduced to seven, namely:-(i) Any Bill relating to Defence.(ii) Any Bill relating to External Affairs, provided that Bills of the follow-ing character shall not be. regarded as coming within this category:  -.(a) Any Bill relating to and conforming with any trade agreement con-cluded with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Ceylon withother parts of the Commonwealth.(-.6) Any Bill. relating solely to the prohibition or restriction of immigra-tion* -into Ceylon, provided that the Governor-General may reserve anysuch Bill, if in his opinion its provisions regarding the right of re-entry of persons resident in the Island at the date of the passing of the Billby the Legislature are unfair or unreasonable.(c) Any Bill relating solely to the franchise .&apos;f(d) Any Bill relating solely to the prohibition or restriction of the im-&apos;portation of, or the imposition of import duties upon, any class, of goods,provided that such legislation is. not discriminatory in character.(iii) Any Bill affecting currency or relating to the issue of bank notes.(iv) Any Bill of an extraordinary nature and importance whereby theRoyal Prerogative or the rights and property of British subjects not residing in Ceylon or the trade or transport or communications of any part of theCommonwealth may be prejudiced.- (v) Any Bill any of the provisions of-which have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, in the opinion of theGovernor-General, is likely to involve oppression or serious injustice to anysuch community.(vi) Any Bill which repeals or amends any provision of the Constitution,or which is in any-way repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisions ofthe Constitution, unless the Governor-General shall have been authorised by the Secretary of State to assent thereto.(vii) Any Bill which is repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisionsof a Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance. . (See Article 39 (5) of S.P. XIV.)* See paras. 234-235 and 242 (i) above. j See paras. 237-238 and 242 (ii) above.
&apos;        .   903- 333 - It is stated in the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanies- IS.P.XIV that.the legislative power proposed to be conferred by-Article 7 ofS.P.XIV is the widest possible power &quot;Authority as ample as the imperial parliament&apos;in the plenitude of its power could bestow &quot; and the Memorandumgoes on to state that the power proposed to be conferred is in fact limitedonly by.-(i) such Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as extend or mayextend to Ceylon; . &apos;(ii) the provisions of Article 8; and(iii) the provisions of Article io (2), which require a two-thirds majority- for. a constitutional amendment.334.-As regards the provisions of Artcle 8 (b) and (c), we have alreadyrecommended* that the Parliament of Ceylon shall not have power to imposeliabilities or confer advantages on persons of any community or religion with-our imposing or conferring similar liabilities or advantages on persons of all communities and religions. We agree with the remaining provisions (a) and (d)of this Article, namely that Parliament shall not make any law to prohibitor restrict the free exercise of any religion, of to alter the constitution of anyreligious body, except with&quot; the&apos;approval of the&quot;governing authority of thatreligious body, but we prefer the wording &quot; at the request &quot; in place of &quot; withthe approval &quot;. \335. Article 10 confers on the Parliament of Ceylon the power to repeal the Order in Council embodying the new Constitution, and power to amendit by a two-thirds majority. We have recommended that the Order in Council. shall provide that the Governor-General shall in every case reserve for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure any Bill by.which any provision of theConstitution is repealed or amended, or which is in any way-repugnant to orinconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, unless he shall have been authorised by the Secretary of State to assent thereto.336. Under Article 11 of S.P.XIV the Parliament of Ceylon would been abled to make laws having extra-territorial operation. Experience elsewhereof the complications attendant upon legislation of this character makes it, inour opinion, inadvisable to confer this power under the type of. Constitution we.propose, and we recommend that the existing situation in this respect should bemaintained. . -1 337. In conformity whh the Declaration of 1943, it will be necessary to give to the. Governor-General the power to enact any direction of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in regard to matters concerning. Defence and External Affairsrespectively. We shall deal with Defence later in this chapter. With regardto External Affairs we note that in Article 39 (1) of S.P.XIV External Affairsare defined as &quot; any matters other than a matter affecting internal administra-tion .... contained in any Treaty between His Majesty and a Foreign state or Power, or in any agreement \ ..; , between the Governor of Ceylon, and theGovernment of any other part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions or of any foreign state or Power &quot;. This does not seem to us to be a satisfactory description.When our recommendations regarding the reservation of Bills relating toExternal Affairs are taken into account it appears to us that no definition of external Affairs is necessary; For reasons similar to those given, in para-graph 356 regarding the portfolio of Defence we recommend that the portfolioof External Affairs should normally be held by the Prime Minister. We feelconfident that External Affairs will usually be managed through the normalSee para. 242 (iii) above.
* ... . . 1,constitutional machinery and that it will rarely, if ever, be necessary to employ1.a Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance. Nevertheless, there is a further contingencyto be considered. The use of a Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance depends on certain constitutional machinery being in existence, and legislative action inregard to External Affairs may be necessary when such machinery does not exist. For this reason, and in order to ensure that in all possible and unfore-seen circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government may be able to fulfil -their functions in regard to External Affairs, we think that His Majesty in Councilmust at all times have power to legislate by Order in Council in regard toExternal Affairs, and that the Constitution should contain an express pro-vision to this effect. We observe that there is no provision in S.P.XIV tomeet the&quot; case of a failure of constitutional machinery.. We presume that inorder to meet this contingency the usual provision by which His Majesty canrevoke or amend an Order-in-Council will appear in the Constitution.338. The proposal in Article 40 (d) of S.P.XIV to remove from the category of Reserved Bills any iBill which deals only with the establishment of shipping services, or the establishment or regulation of coastal shipping, does not appearto us&apos; to be consistent with the Declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government ofMay, 1943. . .In that Declaration, it is stated that,, apart from measures affecting, defence and External Affairs, it is intended to restrict the general classes of ReservedBills to classes of Bills which relate to the Royal Prerogative, the rights and property of His Majesty&apos;s subjects not residing in the Island, and the tradeand shipping of any part of the Commonwealth.If we interpret it correctly, we think that the Declaration of 1943 does not contemplate the exclusion from the classes of Reserved Bills- of the mattersspecified in Article 40 (d) of S.P.XIV, and we must therefore express ourdisagreement with the proposal contained therein.&apos; , -339. The procedure to be adopted in the case of a difference of. opinionwhether a Bill may properly be reserved under Article 38 is dealt with in Article41 (1) of S.P.XIV, which reads:  &quot; If any question arises- whether a Bill may be reserved, or has&apos; been properly reserved, for -His Majesty&apos;s assent in accordance with Article 38,: the Attorney-General may refer such question to the Supreme Court, by whom it shall be -considered in full bench and whose decision thereon shallbe final.&quot;We know of no precedent for a provison in a Constitution by which, theGovernor&apos;s discretion to reserve a Bill for the signification of His MajectyVpleasure is subject to statutory restriction, and we cannot agree with this Sub-section. If the Ceylon Cabinet considered that, a Bill had been improperlyreserved, it&apos; would be open to them to resign and, if necessary, to force aGeneral Election on the issue. There would, we consider, be ample constitu-t-ional means by which the Cabinet could ensure the most careful reconsider a-tion of the position in such cases&apos; by the Governor-General and the ImperialAuthorities-concerned. But there are overwhelming objections to an arrange-ment under which a difference between the Imperial Government and the ceylon Government (for a dispute as to the proper exercise iby the Governor-General of his discretion would be nothing less) should be capable of referenceto any Court for decision at the instance of either party to the dispute, and still less at the instance of one party only.34b. The substitution of Cabinet Government for the Executive Committeesystem, the disappearance of the Officers of State, the reduction of the classesof Reserved Bills and the closer approximation of the position of the Governor
&apos; of-Ceylon to that of a Governor-General of a Dominion makes it necessaryto consider what advice he should have at his disposal to assist him in any matter where he is enjoined to act in his discretion and, though bound to refersuch a matter to the Prime Minister for advice, is not bound to accept such advice. Normally we should expect that the Governor-General would act inclose consultation and co-operation with the Prime Minister, and-we trust thatthe ocpasions when the Governor-General&apos;s views are at variance with the viewsof the Prime Minister will be most infrequent and exceptional.341. Nevertheless, it is desirable that the Governor-General should be able,if heiso desires, to have recourse to other advice; for instance:-(a) In matters of Defence he should be able to consult with the senior naval, (military and air force officers in the Island; their advice would also he available to the Prime Minister in his capacity of Minister of Defence,*(6) In External Affairs, we assume that the Governor-General will, where necessary, obtain guidance from His Majesty&apos;s advisers in the United King-&apos;dom.(c) We deal with the matter of advice to the Governor-General in theexercise of the Royal Prerogative of Pardon in para. 405 below.(d) As regards classes (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of the Bills which werecommend that the Governor-General should be instructed to reserve, hewould be able to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomand the Attorney-General in Ceylon.342. Under the present Constitution,  the Legal Secretary must certifyall Bills prior to submission to the Governor for assent.    We recommendthat such certification should, under the Constitution we propose, be given-by the Attorney-General,   l343. In the matter of appointments which lie within the discretion of theGovernor-General,, e.g. the membership of the Delimitation Commission, thePublic Services Commission, the Judicial Services Commission and nominationto the Legislature, the Governor-General will consult the Prime Minister but will not be precluded from making-such other enquiries as he may think fit.344. At present, all communications from His Majesty.&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom to the Ceylon Government pass through the Governor^ officeand are distributed thence to the appropriate Ministries. Under the future constitution, we recommend that Dominion practice should be broadly followedso that in all appropriate cases such communications should be addressedto the Prime Minister&apos;s office. In that event, the Governor-General will requireonly a small Secretariat, but we think that a civil servant of high standingshould be- appointed to acc as his Private Secretary, on the analogy of thePrivate Secretary to the Viceroy vuf India.345. Under the existing Constitution, the Governor has a statutory duty to see and approve a great many matters of minor and eveR trivial moment-Village Committee By-Laws and so forth. In his Reforms Despatch, SirAndrew Caldecott drew attention to the &quot; man)^ formal acts of approvalwhich the Law at present requires to be performed by the Governor &quot; and recommended that, on the advent of responsible Ministers, they should beplaced within the legal compass of the appropriate Minister, either by delegationor Statute. ,We agree. 1 .346 In the matter of summoning, proroguing and dissolving parliament and the. appointment and dismissal of Ministers, the Governor-General should* See para. 358 below.
act in accordance with the conventions \ applicable to the exercise of similarfunctions by His Majesty in the United Kingdom.347. In the event of the Governor-General being absent-from the Islandor being prevented from acting, we recommend that, unless there shall havebeen some other appointment by^Dormant Commission, the Chief . Justiceshould administer the Government. .348! It is proposed in S.P.XIV that when the new Constitution comes.intoforce the Governor should bear the title of &quot; Governor-General &quot;. Wesupport this proposal.    &quot; ,Article 35 of S.P.XIV proposes that there shall be charged upon the Con-solidated Fund (to be established under Article 57) as salary for the Governor-General an - annual sum of  8,000 sterling. We agree, but we think that; asunder, the present Constitution and following practice elsewhere, the salaryshould be free of Income Tax.Defence ,349. As a result &quot;of the development in recent years of &quot;the conception of&quot; total war &quot;, the term &quot; Defence &quot; nowadays covers a very broad field,and it will be necessary to give.it the widest possible interpretation in dealing,with the reservation of Defence in the new Constitution. This was no doubt the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Sub-Section (2). of their Declara-tion of 1943. The inclusion of Bills relating to&apos; Defence within the category* of Bills which the Governor-General is instructed to reserve, as we have proposed in para. 332 (i) above, will ensure that, so far as this subject isconcerned, only legislation conforming with the policy of the Imperial DefenceAuthorities may be enacted by the Parliament of Ceylon.350. The Governor-GeneraFs powers as regards Defence cannot, however,be limited to the control of legislation. As a result of the conditions of modernwarfare, Defence measures involve practically every branch of administration,and it is.necessary to provide for them to come into force as a whole and at short notice. &apos; Even in normal times, when no crisis threatened there would- be occasions on which for the implementation of long-range ImperialDefence policy or for other, reasons--His Majesty&apos;s Government would wishto secure that certain necessary measures were carried out in Ceylon withoutdelay. On-such occasions, the Governor-General would no doubt in theordinary course proceed by the normal constitutional machinery, would explain what was required to his Prime Minister, and would by all possible means endeavour to secure that the measures in&apos;&apos; question were carried outWith the co-operation and through the agency of the Government of the day.If, however, for political or other reasons the Government should proveunwilling to play its part, the Governor-General must, if the.terms of the&quot;1943 Declaration of His MajestyV Government.are to be complied, with, havepower to order the necessary action to3e taken on his own authority. we agree with the proposal contained-in Article 39 (1) of-S.P.XIV, namely, thatthe Governor-General be empowered to meet this situation by means of a -Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance.351. Tnere remain, however, two other contingencies involving defence which may not be capable of being dealt with by normal constitutional methods -or by a Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance. We refer to the emergency of war ora grave national emergency in &quot;which normal constitutional machinery haseither broken down or become ineffective. In order to deal with either ofthese contingencies it may be necessary for His Majesty in Council to legislateby Order in Council. We recommend, therefore, that this power he reserved to His Majesty in Council and that an express provision to this effect beinserted in the Constitution.
352. It-follows from the suggestions we have put forward that, in coh-sequenee of action taken in exercise of special powers relating to Defence,some expenditure may, in certain circumstances, have been, incurred for whichthe sanction of the Legislature is&apos;not forthcoming. In this situation, werecommend that the ultimate allocation of the charge should toe settled by negotiation by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Ceylon.353- We now proceed, to examine the Constitutional Scheme contained inS.P.XIV in so far as it deals with the reservation of Defence. Part IV ofthe Scheme, and especially Articles 38 and 39, are in question.Article 38 (1) (a), provides that the Governor-General where &quot; so instructed by His Majesty may reserve ior His Majesty&apos;s assent . . . ;:; any bill dealing with Defence . . . . . as defined by Article 39.&quot; If&quot; shall &quot; issubstituted for &quot; may,&quot; this provision will conform with our proposals above,except that the definition of Defence in Article 39 (1) (b) differs in certain respects from the terms of Section (2) of the 1943 Declaration of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in that the Ceylon Defence Force and the Ceylon Royal NavalVolunteer.Reserve are excluded from, the definition. While we fully understand the -special interest which the Ceylon Government must have in the welfare and administration of their Local Forces, we cannot agree that the operational control of those Forces can be properly exercised by any authority other thanthe Imperial Defence Authorities. It is clearly necessary that in time of war or emergency tooth the Imperial and the Local Forces in Ceylon must toeunder one and the same operational control. It must not, therefore, bepossible either for the Local Legislature to prevent such control being exercised by passing a BhTwhich, under Article 38 (1) (a) of S.P.XIV, would not bea Bill to be reserved, or for the Governor-General to be unable by Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance to establish such control if it was not voluntarily accepted.For these reasons, we recommend that the definition-of Defence in Articles39 (1) (6) of S.P.XIV be amended by the omission of the words &quot; other thanthe Ceylon Defence Force and the Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve &quot;.354. Article 39 (2) of the Scheme contained in S.P.XIV provides that&quot; A Governor-General&apos;9 Ordinance shall not impose any charge on the revenue of the Island or upon any person resident in the Island, or authorise theappointment or dismissal of any person to or from the service of the Govern-ment of Ceylon.&quot; As We have explained above, circumstances may arise inwhich-the Governor-General, in the execution of Defence measures on theinstructions of the Imperial Authorities, may be obliged to order expenditure which it is impossible to meet without the concurrence of the Ceylon Govern-ment. We have suggested that in this situation the ultimate allocation ofthe charge between the Imperial and Ceylon Treasuries-should form the subjectof negotiations between the two Governments. We doubt whether the questionof the appointment or dismissal of persons to or from the service of theGovernment of Ceylon is likely to- arise on many occasions in &quot;connection withthe Governor-general&apos;s exercise of his special powers in regard to Defence.But in order to leave no possibility of his experiencing difficulties in this regard,we recommend that this stipulation should not toe binding upon the Governor-. General where the exercise of his Defence powers is concerned.355. Similar circumstances arise in connection with Article 39 (3). TheGovernor-General may, in the carrying out of instructions relating to Defencefrom, the Imperial Authorities,-have no alternative but to issue directions toa public officer, if he is faced with the non-co-operation of his Ministers.We cannot agree that-the Governor-General&apos;s powers to carry out the instruc-tions of the Imperial Authorities in a Defence matter of importance shouldbe circumscribed by the necessity to obtain the concurrence of Ministers.   -
356. The intention of Article 39 (4) is no doubt to ensure that the Governor-General shall-first exhaust the,possibilities of action through the usual politicaland admdniistrafive channels before exercising ibis special powers. We havealready, expressed.bur full agreement with this intention, but we see grave danger in the stipulation that one month must elapse before the Gdveonnor-General takes action on his&apos; owmauthoirity -after seeking and failing to obtainthe co-operation of - the Government. This condition might well neutralisethe whole purpose add effect of the Goverhor-GeneraTs action and imperil thesecurity of the- Island and the Commonwealth, and we can only accept itsimposition in cases where.the Governor-General is satisfied that the interestsof the Defence of Ceylon and of.the Commonwealth would not be prejudiced.357. As we have already made clear, it has been necessary, in our recom-mendations for the working-of the Defence reservation in the manner described above, to make provision for every possible contingency, including the non-co-operation of the Ceylon Government in the Defence policies of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. In doing so we have no wish to cast any - reflection on thepolitical leaders of Ceylon, who have loyally co-operated in the present war,or on the Island&apos;s future leaders who will, we.are convinced, extend to theDefence of the. Empire with which Ceylon is so vitally concerned the sameunstinted co-operation as the leaders of to-day. But in matters of Defenceit is necessary to provide for every possible contingency, likely and unlikely,as the experience of the present war has proved, and&apos; we should be failing inbur duty if we omitted to provide for the situation described above. we take it, however, that in the normal . course relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Ceylon will be completelyharmonious hi Defence as in other matters^ and that recourse to the Governor-Generahs special powers will in practice rarely, if ever, prove necessary. Wemust now consider the channels by which, in the normal course, the ImperialAuthorities will make known their Defence policies to the Government of ceylon and enlist the latter&apos;s co-operation.     .358. We&apos; suggest that there should be a Portfolio Of Defence held &quot;bythe Prime Minister. He, as Head of. the Government, would be the mostsuitable repository for. the information on&apos; Imperial Defence policy whichwould in the course,of his duties inevitably come his way, and the naturaladviser to the Governor-General on all those Defence questions in which local political considerations are involved; and in the event of legislation being required,&apos;he would, as Minister of Defence, be the most&apos;appropriate Minister totake charge of the Bill. In regard to all administrative matters connectedwith Defence, the Minister of Defence, on instructions when necessary fromthe Imperial Authorities received through the Governor-General, would be the instrument through which Imperial policies would be carried out.While the powers of the Minister of Defence would necessarily be Mmitedby-the overriding authority of the Imperial Government, the post would, weconsider, be one of great responsibility and importance, especially as, apartfrom the advice which he would give- to the Imperial Authorities on matters affecting the Ceylon Government, the Minister would also be closely connected .with the extent and nature of the contribution made by Ceylon herself to theDefence of the Commonwealth.The Maldives359. The Maldive Islands, which lie 400 miles to the South-West of ceylon and are often loosely referred to as a dependency of Ceylon, are in fact aProtectorate Of His Majesty&apos;s Government by virtue of the undertaking ghjento the reigning Sultan in t887. It is clear, therefore, that the constitutionalnexus is&apos; with the Imperial Government and not with the Government of ceylon, although for reasons of convenience the Governor of Ceylon receives
the Maldivian tribute annually on behalf of His Majesty. It will thereforebe necessary to include in any new constitutional instruments-which may be framed for Ceylon an exempting provision in respect of the Maldives (similarto Article 2. of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931.Recommendations360. It is difficult to summarise the recommendations of this chapter with-out undue recapitulation. The more important of our recommendations inrespect of the powers&apos;, status and salary of the Governor-General are that:  (i) The classes of Bills which the Governor-General is instructed to.reserve for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure shall be those specifiedin para. 332 above.    . &apos;(ii) The Order in Council embodying the Constitution shall provide that: (a) The Parliament of Ceylon shall not make any law rendering persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to, which persons of other communities or religions are not made liable, or conferupon persons of any community or religion any privileges or advantages which are not conferred on persons of other communities or religions. *(b) Parliament shall not make any law to prohibit or restrict the freeexercise of any religion; or to alter the Constitution of any religions bodyexcept at the request of the governing authority of that religious body.(c) His Majesty in Council shall have power to legislate for Ceylon byOrder in Council in regard to External Affairs and Defence.(iii) The existing situation as regards the power of the Ceylon legislature to make laws having extra-territorial operation shall be maintained.(iv) Certification of all Bills prior to submission to the Governor-general for assent shall be given by the Attorney General.(v) In summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament, and in theappointment and dismissal of Ministers, the Governor-General shall act inaccordance with the conventions applicable to the exercise of similarfunctions by His Majesty in the United Kingdom.(vi) In the event of the absence of the Governor-General from Ceyjon, &quot;or of his being prevented from acting, the Chief Justice shall administer theGovernment unless there shall have been some other appointment byDormant Commission.(vii) Communications from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to the Government of Ceylon shall in all appropriate cases beaddressed to the Prime Minister.(viii) Under the new Constitution the Governor shall. bear the title&quot; Governor-General &quot; and shall receive an annual salary of  8,000 sterling.Defence(ix) The-Governor-General shall have power to make laws to be calledGovernor-GeneraFs Ordinances dealing with External Affairs and Defence.(x) The ultimate allocation of any expenditure incurred in consequenceof action taken in exercise of special powers relating to Defence shall besettled by negotiation by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of ceylon.(xi) There shall be a portfolio of Defence and External Affairs held bythe Prime Minister.The Maldiveso (xii) The Order in Council embodying the Constitution shall include anexempting provision in respect of the Maldive Islands, similar to article  of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931.* See para. 2.42 (iii).
-   v      1: CHAPTER XVIII -*      THE^PUBLIC SERVICES361. Throughout this chapter the term &quot; public services &quot; will be used in itswidest sense to include the whole of the Public Services of Ceylon, without the&apos;distinction between the. &quot; Ceylon Civil Service&quot; and the &quot;Ceylon PublicService &quot; described in detail on page 124 of the Donoughmore Report.362. In Chapter VIII of, their Report, the Donoughmore Commissionersreviewed&apos;the state of the Public Services and the disabilities under which theylaboured at that time, arid suggested safeguards designed to preserve and improve the rights and status of the services under the new Constitution.They recommended, inter alia, the reservation to the Governor of the rightto make all appointments to the Public Services,,&apos;with the approval of theSecretary of State in specified cases; the grant to all&apos;public servants holdingposts the filling of which was ^subject to the approval of the Secretary &quot;ofState, or who might have been recruited to such posts before the publicationof their Report, of the unqualified right to retire on proportionate pensionwith compensation for loss of career, either immediately or at any time inthe future; and the reservation to the Secretary of State of the final decision in all matters affecting the salaries and emoluments, pensions and gratuities,prospects and conditions of service of all public servants, who then held or might in future be-recruited for such posts, or the gratuities and pensionspayable to their widows or. orphans or legal representatives.363. Provisions- covering these recommendations were included in the donoughmore Constitution as finally&apos; promulgated, and will be found in articles 86 to 88 inclusive of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council,1931; In that Order&apos; in Council-a distinction is drawn between officersappointed or selected for appointment before the date of publication of the donoughmore Report (17th July, 1928) and officers appointed or selected for appointment between Jthat date and 12th December, 1929, when the Donough-more Scheme was accepted by the Legislative Council of. Ceylon.&apos; 364: The Order provides that the former may retire at any time after thecommencement of the Order, while the latter may retire at any time within five years after the commencement of the Order, terms at least equal to&quot;abolition of office &quot; terms being, granted in both cases. This distinctionpresumably had its origin principally in the consideration that persons accept-ing.appointment after the publication of the Donoughmore Report were in aposition to gain from that Report some idea of the general conditions underwhich they were likely to have to serve and thus had less claim for compensa-tion in consequence of the change from pre-Donoughmore conditions..&apos;&quot;In all&quot;, some 347: officers entitled to the unlimited option have alreadyretired, and the option, still remains open to some 247 officers still in theService to exercise if they so desire. . Five officers took advantage of the option of retirement within five years.      . &apos;.-       .*   .365. For those who elected to remain in the Service, it cannot be said; thatthe disabilities noticed by the Donoughmore.. Commissioners have diminishedto any great extent since 1931, notwithstanding the Commissioners&apos; strictures.Indeed, certain provisions of the 1931 Constitution, notably Article 32 of the ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, which imposes on Members of theState Council the duty of taking an-active interest in the administration ofthe various subjects and functions of. Government with which the ExecutiveCommittees are entrusted; and Public Services-Regulations Nos., 13 and 15,which give to Executive Committees the right to make recommendations for the
filling of practically all important appointments, whether substantive or acting,seem specifically designed to perpetuate that interference of Ministers and Mem-bers of Council in personnel questions which the Donoughmore Comrnissioners.rightly deplored.,-The evidence submitted .to us, and the conclusions we have drawn frominformal conversations with public servants of all classes in various parts of ceylon, leave no doubt in our minds that this interference continues to be oneof the principal sources of discouragement and ill-feeling throughout thePublic Services, especially among the31 senior officers.366. During the period of our stay in Ceylon, two instances came to ournotice of public criticism by Ministers of senior public servants who&apos; hadneither the right nor the opportunity of replying in their own defence. Inthe one case, a Minister dealing in the State Council with a charge of neglectof a certain matter which was the responsibility of one of his Departments,excused himself (by laying the blame on the officer in charge of that Depart-ment.&apos; In the other, aspersions were gratuitously cast on a senior Europeanofficial in a public speech by a Minister whose sole apparent object was themaking of political capital against the European community. Such instances,we are informed, are by no means isolated, and if, with the greatest regret,we feel bound to draw attention to them, it is because they serve to reinforce the arguments which follow for the provision, as part of a new constitution which must necessarily give still freer rein to Ceylon Ministers, of favourableretirement terms for senior officers of the Public Services who do not feelthat they can continue to serve under such conditions.367. Moreover, the tendency noticed by the Donoughmore Commissionerson the part of the Unofficial Members of the former Legislative Council to question the salaries and allowances of members of the Public Servicesappears to have become more, not less, marked since the introduction&quot;of the1931 Constitution. The State Council has made a practice of deleting fromthe Estimates the provision for the passage grants and holiday warrants ofpublic servants and their families, and&apos;the Governor has been obliged tore-insert diem by means of his special powers of certification. t368. It is against this background that one must consider the removal fromthe Secretary of State of the ultimate control of the Public Services, and &apos;thetransfer to the Ceylon Parliament of the right to review annually the expendi-ture on personal emoluments (excepting in certain special cases) which - wethink is necessarily involved in the grant of full responsible government in internal civil administration. While we earnestly hope that the practices wehave referred to will be discontinued toy the Members of. a new Parliamentof Ceylon possessing the unqualified right to review the personal emolumentsof public servants, it will be obvious that the transfer to Parliament of theultimate control in personnel matters will constitute a far more radical changein the conditions of service of existing members of the Public Services thanthose introduced in 1931, arid that, in consequence, the right to retire on pension with compensation for loss of career must be provided under the newConstitution for the officer affected.369. We adhere to the general principles laid down in similar circumstancesby the Donoughmore Commissioners, i.e. that: (1) the right should be unqualified;(ii) it should extend to all officers whether European or Ceylonese whoare now in the service of the Ceylon Government and whose appointmentsare subject to the approval of the Secretary of State; and
(iii) it should be a continuous option lasting not for a specific period,but throughout the period of each officer&apos;s service under the ceylon government.370. Nevertheless, we consider that some distinction should be made between the terms offered to public servants appointed before the date of publication of the Donoughmore Report :17th July, 1928-and thoseappointed or selected for appointment on or after that date. To the latter classof officers the constitutional developments, which have been continuouslyunder - discussion since the introduction of the Donoughmore constitution and which it is our duty in this Report to formulate, cannot be said to have come as a surprise. Since 1931 it has become increasingly clear that furtherevolution towards full self-government was only a matter of time. For thisreason we consider that, an unlimited option to retire at any time in. thefuture should hot be granted to officers appointed since the publication of the donoughmore Report, but we would concede to all such officers the rightgranted in somewhat similar circumstances by Article 88 (1) of the Ceylon(State Council) Order in Council, 1931, to retire within a limited period. Wesuggest that all officers appointed on or after the 17th July, 1928, shouldhave the option to retire on pension, with compensation for loss of career,for a period of three years from the promulgation of any new constitution which may be granted as a, result of our recommendations. &quot; We have limited the period to three years rather than five-in view of the time which is likely toelapse between the publication of our Report and the entering into force ofany new Constitution which may be framed as a result.371. We note that in Article 67 of the Draft Order in Council contained inS.P.XIV the option of retirement for all officers, irrespective of the date, of appointment, is withdrawn one year after the date appointed for the-intro-duction of the new Constitution. It would in our opinion be unreasonableso to limit the option, since it is impossible to foresee within so short a timeexactly how the new Constitution will affect the interests of public servantsMoreover, if the option of retirement were so restricted, it seems inevitable that many officers would elect to retire in apprehension of future developmentswho might, if a longer period were allowed, come to realise that their fearswere exaggerated. The number of retirements within that period might indeed be so large as to cause embarassment to the&apos;Government. Moreover, it may come about that if the day appointed for the introduction of the new Constitu-tion falls closely on its publication,&apos; and terms and conditions of retirementhad not already been worked out:-and approved, the. time taken for theirpreparation and approval may seriously encroach on the one year allowed for the exercise of the option. Lastly, an attempt to recruit large numbers of replacement officers within a short period would undoubtedly mean that inferiorcandidates would be included. -    -&apos;372. We therefore recommend that:  (i) the right to retire on pension with compensation for loss of careeralready held by certain classes of officers (i.e. those whose appointments are subject to approval by the Secretary of State) appointed before 17th July,&apos;. 1928, shall be secured to them afresh under the new Constitution;(ii) in the case of all officers of the classes specified ..(i.e. whose appoint-ments are subject to the approval of the Secretary of State) appointedor selected for appointment after 16th July, 1928, and before the publicationof this Report, a similar right of retirement on pension, with compensationfor loss of, career, shall be granted but to be exercised within a period of threeyears from the date of promulgation of the new Constitution.43668 &quot; D z
(iii) Retirement on terms at least equal to &quot; abolition of office &apos;.&apos; termsshall be granted to&apos; all public officers whose posts cease to exist by reasonof the corning into operation of the new Constitution.(iv) the pension rights (including the prospective pensions of widows andorphans)-of officers who have already retired, of officers still jn the Public.Services, and of officers who have accepted or may accept transfer fromtfie Ceylon Public Services but have earned a proportion of their ultimate. retiring pension by service in Ceylon,- shall be suitably safeguarded.The Public Services Commission&apos;-&apos; 373- ln Article 86 of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, thepowers of. appointment, promotion, transfer, dismissal and disciplinarycontrol of public officers are vested in the Governor, and the Public services commission set up under Article 89 is advisory to him in the exercise ofthose powers. The Commission normally consists of the Chief Secretary as chairman and two other members who have up to the present been theFinancial and Legal &quot;Secretaries.374. The transfer to the Parliament of Ceylon of full responsible govern-ment in internal affairs will involve a considerable increase in the responsi-bilities of the Public Services Commission. . Hitherto, the ultimate decision inall important cases has rested with the Secretary of State, and public servants &apos;have felt that they could rely on the impartiality of an authority so remotefrom local influence. Henceforward, except-in so far as the right of thesubject to petition His Majesty is concerned, there will.be no appeal in personnel matters to any authority outside Ceylon. It will therefore be doublynecessary that the deciding authority in Ceylon should be immune fromaccusations of partisanship.Composition375- We have given much thought to the question of the proper composition of the re-constituted Public Services Commission which will, under our recommendations, advise the Governor-General as to the final decision onpersonnel questions.- We see no treason to depart from the normal arrangements as regards the number of members of the Commissiomand we recommend that,in conformity Avith Article 62 (1) of S.P.XIV which continues these arrange-ments, the Commission shall consist of three members one of whom should be chairman. We also agree with the provisions of Article 62 (2) in regard tothe disqualification of Members of the House of Representatives or the Senate,pr of candidates for election to either House, for appointment to the Com-missiOn.376. With regard to the concluding provision of Article 62 (2), however, that not more than one of the Commissioners may be a person drawing a Ceylonpension, we consider that, in order that there may at all times be sufficientknowledge and experience of the machinery of government available to theCommission, it should, be mandatory that one, but not more than one, of theCommissioners should be either a retired public servant, or a public servantwhose membership of the Commission would be his. last appointment underthe Ceylon Government. ;377. It has been suggested in some quarters that at least one of the Com-missioners should be a retired Judge. We recognise that there will be many occasions in the course of the Commission^ business, especially in regard to(disciplinary proceedings and appeals, when the legal knowledge and experience and the judicial qualities of mind attaching to a former ocfcupant of the Bench &apos;would be of the. greatest value. But legal advice will always *be availableto the Commission from other sources, and we consider that, other things being
equal, adrninistrative ability and experience gained either inside, or outsidethe public services is more important than legal experience, in the case, of a commissioner whose duties^will include not merely the settling of disciplinarycases, but also of questions of appointment, cadre, conditions of service, etc.,which, are in no sense judicial. While, therefore, there maybe from tirne&apos;totime a retired Judge who is eminently suitable for appointment to the Coin-mission, we do not consider that this will necessarily be so at all times, nor thatthe appointment of a retired Judge not clearly suited to the task would, byreason only of the fact that he has held judicial office, enhance the authority and reputation of the Commission.Appointment.378. In order to safeguard the impartiality of the Commission to the maxi-raum possible extent, we recommend that its &quot;Chairman and members&quot; shallbe appointed by the Governor-General in his discretion&apos;. We note that thisconforms with the proposal in Article 62 (1) of S.P.XIV.Functions.379. Under the Scheme contained in S.P.XIV, the powers of promotion,transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the public services are vested in the Governor-General. But the functions of the &quot;Public services commission are specifically referred to only in Article 64, which lays down that appointments not otherwise provided for and carrying an official salary of not less than Rs.3,600 shall be made by the Governor-General on the recom-mendation of the Public Services Commission. We assume that it was theintention of the frarners of the Scheme that the Governor-General&apos;s powers asregards promotion, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control shall also beexercised in a similar.manner to the power of appointment, i.e., on the advice of the Public Services Commission) and we recommend that these powers should be so exercised. &apos;380. Powers oif, subordinate appointment will no doubt be delegated, as atpresent, to Heads of Departments; but we see no reason why the presentsalary limit of Rs.2,600 a year (Rs.3,200 a year in the case of &quot; old entrants &apos;.&apos;-)above which powers may not.be so delegated should be raised to Rs.3,600 asproposed in Article 64 (1) of the Sessional Paper Scheme. Nor can we agreewith the provision in Article 66 (2) for the delegation of powers relating topersonnel matters to Ministers, since, as we have said, the primary object ofour recommendations in.this regard is to remove the public services so far&quot;as&quot;possible from political influence.Administration of the Public Services: transfer of existing functions.381. Subject tothe overriding provisions of Articles 33 and 86 of the Ceylon(State Council)&quot; Order in &apos;Council,  1931, the functions and subjectsi which ,together may be described as &quot;the administration of the Public Services &quot;are, at present, allocated under the Statement of Administrative procedure as follows:  Chief Secretary.Administration of the public services.  Granting of leave to public officers..Government&apos;quarters and office accommodation. -   -Financial Secretary. * - \Salaries, wages, allowances, remuneration and fees of Government em-ployees; travelling regulations; leave regulations; passages of Governmentofficers; holiday warrants; ^periodical railway passes and concession&apos; tickets;season tickets for Government employees; regulation of advances of salary toGovernment officers; cadres of staffs; security of public officers; pensions;widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions; provident, guarantee, benevolent, benefit&quot;and other funds relating to Government officers,
382. It will bo seen that in practice the admiriistration of the public services is divided between two officers of State the Chief Secretary and the FinancialSecretary ,lsuch itemsas &quot; cadres of staffs &quot;and &quot; salaries, wages, allowances,remuheration and fees of &quot;Government employees&quot; falling to the latter. TheChief Secretary, &quot;however, deals with disciplinary matters and such questions as, transfers, grant of increments, promotions from class to class in the clericalservice, and-general, questions of conduct of public servants, e.g., in relation toirivieSteieJris, . indebtedness, participation&apos; in political&apos; affairs, etc!383. The position is thus that, under the present arrangements, there exists in regard to the administration of the Public Services a system of diarchyin which the major responsibility rests with the Chief Secretary and the moreimportant powers with the Financial Secretary. We consider that it wouldbe to the advantage, both of the public and of the Public Services, if asimilar diarchy is avoided under any new Constitution that may be granted.While we.do not propose to go into the detailed organisation of the newgovernmental machine, we would suggest that, if our recommendations asregards the setting up of a Ministry of Finance and a system of permanent secretaries to. Ministers are accepted, the subjects at present allocated to theFinancial Secretary would appropriately fall within -the purview of thePermanent Secretary to the Minister of Finance, who would, as in England,be regarded as the Head of the Public Service and the officer ultin vtelyresponsible for its efficiency and contentment-subject, jf course, to the overriding responsibility of the Legislature in regard to the provision of fu^is.Under such an arrangement, the system of Treasury Circulars in force inEngland would no doubt be used to prescribe principles and practice through- .out the Public Services, and the Permanent Secretaries to Ministers and the heads of individual Departments would be responsible for their enforcement.384; As regards the remaining functions in relation to the Public services at present exercised by the Chief Secretary, we suggest that the grant of leavemight be transferred to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry concerned inthe case of senior officers, and to Heads of Departments in the case of other officers. /Decisions as regards Government quarters and office accommodationrriight.be transferred to the Ministry of Finance, while the remaining functions,with the exception of discipline and appeals, dealt with below, might be dis-tributed between the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Finance and theother Permanent Secretaries or Heads of Departments, by delegation under aprovision similar to that in Article 66 (2) of S.P.XIV, amended--as proposed above to exclude the delegation of powers relating to personnel matters to ministers, These are however only suggestions. We do not wish to make( recommendations as to the re-allocation of duties between/the various Govern-&apos; ment Departments concerned, as this can only be worked out in detail afterthe. new constitutional instruments have been drafted.Disciplinary Proceedings and Appeals,,.385. The procedure to be followed in regard to the conduct.of disciplinaryproceedings and the hearing of-appeals by public servants in respect of salaries,promotions, conditions of service and disciplinary matters remains to beconsidered. In the following paragraphs we propose to indicate the general&quot;fines on which we consider that powers in these matters might be exercised.We recommend that:   -    &apos;(1) where under the present Constitution the Head of Department caninstitute and complete disciplinary &quot;proceedings without reference to any higher authority, the officer in the position of Head of Department underthe new Constitution (not the Permanent Secretary) shall continue to beable to institute and complete such proceedings;
&apos; (2) where under the^present Constitution the Head of Department can.only institute proceedings and complete an enquiry, but is not empoweredto take a decision and must therefore refer the proceedings to the public services Commission, who in turn advise the Governor as to the findingajid final1 punishment, if any, similar proceedings under the new Constitutionshall continue to be submitted to&apos; the Public Services Commission throughthe Permanent Secretary to the Ministry, who will make his own recom-mendations; but the decision will rest with the Public Services Commissionwithout further reference to the Governor-General;(3) where under the present Constitution disciplinary proceedings can.be instituted only with the approval of the Governor, they shall be institutedunder the new Constitution only with the approval of the Public services commission. - The enquiry shall be conducted by a person or personsspecially appointed, and the findings shall be submitted to the Public services commission who shall then make a recommendation to the Governor-General;(4) in. regard to such disciplinary cases as now come before the public services Commission under the present Constitution, the Commission shallbe a reviewing, or confirming authority under the new Constitution, and&apos;  shall act as a Board of Appeal see paras. 386-388.below.386.. We are informed that under the present arrangements the chief secretary and the Financial Secretary spend a considerable amount of their time dealing with appeals by public servants on questions involving;: (a) salaries, promotions and conditions of service in individual cases;(b) disciplinary matters;(c) salaries, general conditions of service, etc., of particular classes ofpublic servants.In many cases these matters are referred to the Governor, and ultimately tothe Secretary of State, for final decision.387. As regards (c), we understand that the Ceylon Government have under active consideration the question of the ventilation of general.as distinct from individual grievances through organisations corresponding to Whitley councils and Joint Trade Councils in the United Kingdom, which would be set up inaddition to the various existing Public Service Associations. As regards thegrievances of individuals under (ai) and (6) above, we assume that the consti-tutional right of a subject to petition the King cannot be denied to a publicservant, notwithstanding the grant of full responsible government under theCrown in all matters of internal civil administration. Assuming on this basis that the right to petition must continue to be admitted, we suggest that theladder of petition should be as follows:  (1) the Head of Department;(2) the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry;(3) the Governor-General advised by the Public Services Commission (orthe Judicial Services Commission, as to which see paras. 397-400 below);(4) the Secretary of State;(5) His Majesty the King.It is well known that the habit of petitioning is deeply ingrained among theCeylonese.   If it is possible, we trust that regulations will be framed underwhich only petitions worthy of serious consideration, and which have not been rejected on a previous occasion, will rise higher than rung (3) of the ladder.388. A number of witnesses speaking on behalf of the Public Service Asso-ciations recommended that a separate Appeal Board should be set up to dealwith appeals from the Public Services Commission. We deprecate theinclusion of a further step in the ladder of appeals, which would causeadditional delay in the reaching of a final decision, and we consider-that, with
an independent Public Services Commission on the lines we have proposed,which will not itself institute or conduct disciplinary proceedings, no suchAppeal Board is necessary.. 389. As we have already explained, it will be doubly important under a newConstitution, granting powers of full internal self government that theimpartiality of the Public Services Commission shall be safeguarded. Wenote the provision in the S.P. XIV under Article 65 (1) for the impositionof severe penalties on any person who conspires or attempts to influence, --or-succeeds in influencing, decisions of the Public Services Commission bymeans of gifts, promises; threats or other&apos;inducements, and we agree withthis provision so far as it goes. We consider, however, that, the maintenanceof the complete impartiality of the Public Services Commission is of suchparamount importance, and that the temptation to lobby is so great, thatthe means by which influence is attempted should not be too closely defined in the new constitutional instruments. &quot;We therefore recommend that the pro-vision should be widely drawn so as to offer the maximum discouragement-to would-be canvassers.The Auditor-General390. Articles 83 to 85 inclusive of the Ceylon (State Council) Order inCouncil, 1931, provide for the appointment, duties and Annual Report of the. Auditor-General. It appears to us that no important change in these pro-visions will be required in the new Constitution we recommend, and; wenotethat Articles: 56, 58, and 61 of the Constitutional Scheme contained inS.P. XIV do not propose any important departure from the provisions of the1931 Order in Council. -&apos; 391. We understand, however, from certain evidence placed: before us thatit has become the custom in recent years for the .Auditor-General&apos;s Report fo ..contain personal criticisms of the conduct of individual officers and theworking 6i Departments, which are. not strictly appropriate to such a Report.We consider that the inclusion in a published document of such criticisms,except where strictly justified, is not in the best, interests of. the public services, since the officers or Departments concerned have no means of -making a public reply to the charges levelled against them however seriousthey may be and however damaging to their reputation.&apos;:&apos;It would hardly be appropriate to.place restriction on.the contents of theAuditor-General&apos;s Report in the Constitution, but. we trust that in future thepractice we have referred to will be discontinued.Recommendations392. Our recommendations as regards Public Officers are summarised in para. 372 above.As regards the Public Services Commission we recommend that:-(i) There shall be a Public Services Commission consisting of three-members, one of whom shall be Chairman. Members of the Legislature, orcandidates for election to either Chamber shall not be eligible for member-ship of the Commission. One, but not more than one, of the Commissioners. shall be either a retired public servant or a public servant whose member-ship of the Commission would be his last appointment under the ceylon government.(ii) The Chairman and members of the Public Services Commission shallbe appointed by the Governor-General in his discretion.(iii) The powers of appointment, promotion, transfer, dismissal and dis-ciplinary control of all officers of the Public Services shall be vested in the
105 r    1- Governor-General for exercise on the advice of the Public Services Gom-mission. In the case of appointments carrying an initial salary of less thanRs.2,600 a year (Rs.32Q0 a year in the case of &quot;old entrants &apos;.&apos;), these powers may be delegated to any suitable public officer.&quot; (iv) As regards disciplinary proceedings, the procedure summarised in para. 385 above shall be followed. ,(v) The ladder of petition shall be as set out in para. 387 above.(vi) Provision, which shall be as widely drawn: as possible, shall bemade for the imposition of severe penalties on any person who attempts to influence the decisions of the Public Services Commission.CHAPTER XIX &apos;;THE JUDICIAL SERVICES393.. The Constitution we propose will involve the disappearance of theOfficers of State, and it will be necessary to make provision for the devolution of the functions at present carried out by the Legal Secretary. Under theStatement of Administrative Procedure these are:     - .v . s: -&apos;      (a).the provision of legal advice to the Governor the responsibility ofthe Legal Secret ary&apos;s and the Attorney General&apos;s Departments;(b) the administration of justice-dealt with by a Department whose headis the legal secretary&apos;s Principal Assistant;(c) the institution of criminal prosecutions and civil proceedings;6n behalfof the Crown-a duty of the Attorney-General&apos;s Department;        ;-(d) the conduct of elections to the State Council-dealt with by a Depart-meht whose head is the Legal Secretary&apos;s Principal Assistant;(e) the drafting of legislation the duty of the Legal Draftsrrian&apos;s Depart-ment;  .&apos; - .v  ;   (/) the functions of the Public Trustee for which the Public TrusteedDepartment is responsible.394. As an Officer of State, the Legal Secretary, under the present Con-;stitution, sits in the State Council and is thus able to obtain from the Legislaturethe, financial provision required for the administration of justice,, and to deal in the Council with cognate questions. As these functions must continue to becarried out, it will be necessary in future for a Minister to take responsibilityfor them in the Council, For reasons which will be set out more fully below,we do not recommend that; under the new Constitution, for some time at least,the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General should lose their present status as public servants and become Ministers. This being.so, and since it wouldbe difficult for the Minister for Home Affairs to deal with the whole of the subjects now allocated to the Legal Secretary, we recommend the establish-ment of a Ministry of Justice, to which all the subjects set out above will be allocated excepting (a)- the provision of legal advice to the Governor-General which we recommend should in future be a duty of the Attorney^GeneraLandpossibly (d)-the conduct of elections to the State Council which might wellhenceforth be the responsibility of the Ministry for Home.Affairs. The Ministryof Justice would also control the percent Fiscals&apos; Depatment,395. In making these recommendations, we haVe fully considered the objec-tions usually raised by those trained in the English tradition to the establish-ment of a. Ministry of Justice, on the ground that a Ministry so designatedis apt to blur at least in the public mind the line of.demarcation prescribedunder English practice between the Judiciary and the Executive. We realise-that Ceylon is accustomed to the British system and that any departure fromBritish principles would be likely to meet with widespread opposition.
396. We would therefore make it amply clear that in recommending theestablishment of a Ministry of Justice we intend no more than to secure thata Minister shall be responsible for the administrative side of legal business,for obtaining from the Legislature financial provision for the administrationof justice, and for answering in the Legislature on matters arising out of it.There can, of course, be no question of the Minister of Justice having any power of interference in or control over the performance of any judicial orquasi-judicial function, or the institution or supervision of prosecutions. Wehave considered whether the subjects and functions in question might be distributed between other Ministries, but have reached the conclusion thatit. would be most conducive to the efficient-handling of the administrative work in question if they were centred in a new Ministry. Since the Ministersfunctions would be &quot; political and administrative, it would be immaterialwhether he were a lawyer or not, although the Prime Minister, if there were a lawyer of distinction among his supporters, a night possibly wish to offerhim the portfolio. &apos;A] Judicial Services Commission397. As we have indicated, suubject (6) of the present duties of the legal secretary! the administration of justice might be assigned principally tothe Ministry of Justice. We recommend, however, that the appointment,promotion, transfer- and discipline of all District Judges, Magistrates, Com-missioners of Requests and Presidents of Village Tribunals (shortly to be re-named Rural Courts) should be dealt with by a Judicial Services commission which, like the Public Services Commission, should consist of three members.As regards the appointment of the Chief Justice and of Supreme Court Judgeswe agree with Article 69 (1) and with Article 36 (3) of S.P.XIV which lays down that they shall be.appointed by the. Governor-General acting in his discretion, i.e., after consultation with the Prime Minister Whose advice heis not however bound to accept.398. In view of the nature of its duties, high judicial office Would be anessential attribute of membership of the Judicial Commission, and we recom-mend that the President should be the Chief Justice and the members eitherone present and one retired member of the Supreme Court Bench, or twopresent members both to be nominated by the Governor-General acting in his discretion. We are unable to recommend that the Attorney-General should bea member of the Judicial Commission as is proposed in Article 68 (1) ofS.P. XIV in view of his position as a litigant. By this, we do not wishto imply that the Attorney-General would in fact find difficulty in ignoringthe success or failure of Crown cases during consideration of the future of,for example, a judicial officer; but as Sir Edward Jackson wrote on this point when Attorney-General in Ceylon &quot;. . . . . it is difficult to be certain thatno such consideration will be thought by the public to have weighed either with the Attorney-General, or with the judicial officers whose prospects are affected. ... . .&quot;399. It would be desirable, in view of the high-office occupied by themembers, that the Judicial Services Commission should be assisted by a secretary, who might be a senior member of the Judicial Service appointediby the Governor-General on the advice of the Commission, and whose statusshould, we think, be not less than that of the present Principal Assistant tothe Legal Secretary. The Commission would no doubt wish to delegate tothe Secretary certain routine powers.400. Disciplinary proceedings against judicial officers are at present referredto an ad hoc Commission appointed by the Chief Justice at the request of* Sessional Paper V of 1931.
.8107&apos;  : &quot; **the Governor.. This Commission, being concerned wiihmatters of professionalconduct, consists of tone or more Supreme Court Judges and reports fo^tiiePublic Services Commission. We recommend that, if a permanent JudicialServices Commission is appointed as we have proposed, disciplinary matters affecting judicial officers should be referred to it, and that its recommendations should he submitted direct to the Governor-General. &apos;:-V;&apos;Legal Advice to the Governor-General401. We have already recommended above that the Attorney-general should be charged with the duties now carried out by the Legal Secretaryunder this heading. We envisage that, under the Constitutionvwe recom-mend, Ministers will require legal assistance in (a) the day-to-day running of their Departments, (b) the passage of Bills through Parliament, especially at the Committee stage, (c) the interpretation of exising law and in depart-mental matters which may involve legal proceedings, and (,dj matters of high constitutional policy, on which the Cabinet as such may require advice.402. These questions need not all be handled by the Attorney-General. Weenvisage that legal advice under (a) above might in future be tendered to &quot;Departments by Legal Advisors attached to the departmental staff; &quot;Asregards (b), it is, we understand, the practice under the existing constitution for the Legal Draftsman, or one of his assistants to be present in Councilduring the Committee stage of a Bill, where he is usually given a seat onthe floor of the House next to the Minister in charge of- the Bill. Thisarrangement might well continue. Similarly, questions arising under ^e)above would be referred, as at present, to the Attorney-General or to the solicitor-General. &apos; :&quot;:-403. It is in regard to (d)-matters of high constitutional policy on-whichthe Cabinet as such may require advice that difficulties are likely to arise.Since, under the new Constitution, Defence, and External Affairs will be reserved to the Imperial Government, it will be necessary to provide for advice both to the Cabinet and to the Governor-General, on points ofconflictor ambiguity which may arise from time to time in connection with. these subjects between the Imperial Government and the Ceylon Government, and between the Governor-General and the Cabinet.This could be given, provided that our recommendation as to his non-political status is accepted, by the Attorney-General; who would be in much the same position as the present Legal Secretary, who is legal adviser both tothe Governor and to, the Board of Ministers under the present Constitution.If, however, he were&apos; a political personage as in England, the- Ministers, might seek his advice; but the Gevemor-General could not do so. It is principallyfor this reason that, having considered the matter carefully, we-have-reeem-mended above that he should not have political status. The position maywell change in future as self-government develops and the field on whichclashes of opinion between the Imperial and Ceylon Governments.: can; occurnarrows. . , . ;.&apos;Legal Advice to the Speaker404. We are informed that- in the early days of the present Constitutionit was the custom of the Speaker to ,seek the advice of the Legal, secretary in open Council when points of difficulty arose out of the Standing Ordersor the interpretation of the Ceylon (State Council) Order in GouhciL:- as experience of the working of tire Council has developed such consultationhas, we are informed, become progressively less and though the legal secretary:, still argues points of order as a Member, of the State Council,the Speaker in no way feels bound to and in some cases does not, follow
nia advice. In view of these developments, we consider that/ so far asparfiamentaiy procedure is concerned, the Speaker and his staff, under thenew Constitution, are unlikely to require legal assistance from any Memberof the Legislature, though arrangements might be made &apos;for him to be provided with legal advice from an independent source outside the Council (cf, theCounsel to the Speaker in England).Advice to the Governor-General on the exercise of the Royal Prerogativei of Pardon405. This is a large question in Ceylon, as not merely advice on the com-mutation of sentences is linvolved, but also advice on the innumerable petitionswhich are addressed, to the Governor praying for the remission Of sentences,however trivial. Under the present practice, advice on these matters is withinthe province of the Legal Secretary, who also advises, when required, inrespect of the Governor&apos;s periodical reviews of long-term sentences. Underthe new Constitution, we suggest that these responsibilities, should devolve onthe Minister of Justice.: In view of the ease with which the duty of advising the Governor-general in these matters might be turned to political ends, we would express the hopethat the Minister would hesitate to tender to the Governor-General advicecontrary to the recommendation he had received ,from the Attorney-General,the Permanent Secretary and other non-political advisers, jn order to securethat he should be relieved as far as possible from political pressure, we suggestthat the Minister of Justice should normally be a member of the Senate, and&quot;that a-Parhamentary Secretary should sit in the House of Representatives ashis deputy.Subordinate staff attached to the Judicial Services.406. It has been represented to us that consideration should be given, inthe reorganisation of the Public Services which will no doubt be carried out as a result of the new Constitution, to the establishment of a new branchto contain the subordinate staff attached to the - Courts, including the SupremeCourt. We understand that at present such officers, as Secretaries to DistrictCourts, Chief Clerks to Magistrates Courts and Stenographers attached to-Courts are liable to transfer to any Department in the Public Services. In-view of the specialised nature of their duties and the advantage whichfamiliarity with legal procedure and practice would give them, we think, thatthe institution of such a separate service would contribute to the efficient working of the Courts. The &quot;Service might be administered, subject to thePublic Service Regulations, by the Minister of Justice, and might also provide the clerical and other staff of all Departments under the Minister ofJustice.Recommendations407. We recommend that:  (i) A Ministry of Justice shall be established with the functions described in paras. 393 above.     .(ii) There shall be a Judicial Services Commission consisting of the chief justice as Chairman and two other members, either one present and oneretired member of the Supreme Court Bench or two present members,appointed by the Governor-General,in his discretion.(Hi) The Judicial Services Commission shall advise the Governor-general in the exercise of his powers of appointment, promotion, transfer, dismissaland disciplinary control of all District Judges, Magistrates, commissioners of Requests and Presidents of Village Tribunals.(iv) The Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court shall beappointed by the Governor-General acting in his discretion.
- EPILOGUE   -408. The Constitution we recommend for Ceylon reproduces in large measure the form of the British Constitution, its usages and conventions, and may onthat account invite the criticism so often and so legitimately levelled againstattempts to frame a government for an Eastern people on the pattern of western democracy. -. *We are well aware that self-government of the British Parliamentary type,carried on by means of a technique which it has taken centuries to develop&apos;,may not be suitable or practicable for another country, and that where thehistory, traditions and culture of that Country are foreign to those of GreatBritain, the prospect of transplanting British institutions with success may appear remote. But it does not follow that the -invention of modifications orvariations of the British form of government to meet different conditions else-where will be any more successful. It is easier to propound new constitutionaldevices and fresh constructive solutions than to foresee the difficulties and disadvantages which they may develop. At all events, in recommending forCeylon a Constitution on the British pattern, we are recommending a method ofgovernment we know something about, a method which is the result of very long experience, which has been tested by trial and error and which works and,on the whole, works well. &apos;409. But be that as it may, the majority--the politically conscious majorityof the people of Ceylon-favour a Constitution on British lines. Such a Con-stitution is their own desire and is not being imposed upon them. It is truethat, if in our opinion it were manifestly unsuitable for Ceylon, our duty,notwithstanding the demands of the Ceylonese, would be so to report. We-could not recommend a Constitution of the British type and then, when itsfailure had become apparent, merely retort &quot; Vous Eavez voulu, GeorgesDandin.&quot;410. But we think that Ceylon is well qualified for a Constitution framedon the British model, and we regard our proposals as a further stage in the evolution of the system under which Ceylon was governed prior to 1931- an evolution to some extent interrupted by the experiment of the Donough-. more Constitution of that year. It is, however, doubtful whether the reformswe now contemplate would have been appropriate or successful in. 1931.But to-day, thanks to. the political education and experience gained by thepeople of Ceylon during the period of the Donoughmore Constitution, wethink.that.it should be well within the capacity of a. future Government of ceylon to. operate a form of Constitution which does not represent a noveland strange creation; but is the natural evolution of a type of governmentwith which the Ceylonese had for some time been familiar.411. The State Council of Ceylon has successfully adapted to its own needs and circumstances most of the usages and practice of the British House ofCommons. Its Standing Orders are based on ours, its procedure reproducesthe British model in almost every detail.   A British Member of Parliament-would quickly find himself at home in the Parliament of Ceylon, where hewould be greatly impressed by the intimate-acquaintance of its members with the language, history, literature and laws of England. But he wouldalso be somewhat astonished to hear Ministers criticising each other on the floor-of the House and moving amendments hostile to the.proposals of a-colleague. Equally strange to him would be the sight of a Minister moving aresolution or introducing a Bill and at the same time expressing disagreement with its contents. The explanation would be that, despite his own judgment,the Minister was carrying out the instructions of his Executive Committee,,
-   noThese aberrations result from the present Constitution, with its system of executive, Committees and division of the various Ministries into water-tightcompartments, each of them, as it were, a. separate little Cabinet.412. The proposals we have put forward in this Report aim at restoring the method of. government to a more normal channel&apos; and creating the Minis-terial responsibility which is, in our view, essential to Parliamentary govern-menti It must be borne in mind-that a number of the political leaders of ceylon have been educated in England and &quot;have absorbed British politicalideas. When they demand responsible government, they mean governmenton the British Parliamentary model and are apt to resent any deviation from it as &quot;derogatory to their, status as fellow citizens of the British Common-, Wealth of Nations and as conceding something less than they consider is theirdue.* To put it more colloquially, what is good enough for the British is good enough for them. -413. We realise that proposals for the reform of a country&apos;s Constitutionmust be conditioned by its history and traditions. We are also well aware thatthe people of Ceylon have not reached the same stage of political development as the people of Britain/ and that what may be appropriate for the lattermay not yet be appropriate for the Ceylonese. But we think it &quot;better to devise a Constitution somewhat in advance of the stage already reached ratherthan behind it, trusting in the power of education and the lessons of experience to promote further development. The enlargement of . liberty is alwaysattended by risk, tout it is well to bear in mind a wise observation attributed to Aristotle, &quot; The only way of-learning to play the flute is to play the flute.&quot;414. The goal of the people of Ceylon is Dominion status, and we under-stand that to be in accordance with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.But for reasons given in various sections of our Report, it is clearly notpossible to reach that goal in a single step. As regards those features of theConstitution we recommend which fall short of Dominion status, the problem. of the Defence of Ceylon is invested with particular importance by reasonof her geographical position, and we do not believe that there is any seriousbody of opinion in the Island which questions the need for its dependenceupon the United Kingdom for some time to come in matters of Defence and,closely linked with Defence, of External Affairs.-415. We have received little, if any, criticism of the proposal to place, thesubject of Currency within the category of Reserved Bills and,, as regardsthe protection of the minorities, we feel sure that in&apos;view of their size and number and their relations with the majority, moderate opinion will recognise the desirability of enacting certain safeguards which will serve to allay theirapprehensions, but which it will be unnecessary, we-trust, ever to employ.416: Throughout our deliberations,; our object has been to make proposalswhich would confer upon Ceylon self-government under a Constitution of her own devising. For that reason, we have endeavoured to put forward recom-mendations which harmonise with the salient features of the Constitutionformulated by the Ceylon Ministers and which at the same time, recognise the legitimate rights of the minorities.We believe that our recommendations, if adopted, will enable Ceylon to enjoy forthwith a full and ample measure of self-government, and in due course to assume the status of a Dominion, thereby bringing nearer theultimate ideal of British statesmanship, the fusion of Empire and commonwealth.* The Right Honourable C. R. Attlee&apos;s Draft Report laid before the Joint Committeeon Indian Constitutional Reform, 18th June, 1934. para. 18.
m &apos;     -. 1ACKNOWLEDGMENTS417: We cannot conclude this Report without some expression of our deep-gratitude to the members of our staff who have helped in its preparation.418. Our work in Ceylon was based upon the efficient office organisationprovided by our Chief Clerk, Mr. C. L. N. Toussaint, ably supported by Mr.W. A. S. Canagasabey, Second Clerk, both of the Ceylon General ClericalService, and Mr. N. W. B. Jansze, Chief Stenographer, who, with a numberof clerical and other officers lent by various Departments of the ceylon government, formed a workmanlike team of Burghers, Tamils and Sinhalesein whose friendly and successful co-operation we see a happy augury for thefuture of Ceylon. -   - ,419. To Mr. Toussaint fell the whole responsibility for registration andcustody of the Commission^ voluminous correspondence, and many dutiesconnected with our Public Sessions. On all occasions he carried out thesevaried tasks with exemplary zeal and efficiency, and the detailed indices he prepared for the memoranda and evidence submitted to us have contributedin no small measure to the expeditious preparation of this Report. Ourcrowded programme threw a heavy strain on Mr. Toussaint and his colleagues,who were on occasions compelled&apos; to work on Sundays and Public Holidaysafter long hours of overtime. All this they did-with the greatest willingness,and we here place on record our high appreciation of their services and ofthe co-operation of the Ceylon Government in releasing them.420. The heaviest burden of our Public Sessions was borne by our OfficialReporter, Miss N.&quot; L.,^Sheppard, who on numerous occasions reported a four-hour Session single-handed and with complete accuracy. In the most favour-able circumstances this would have been a remarkable achievement; In theheat of Colombo and the poor acoustics of the Town Hill it deserves a specialtribute. In addition to her work of reporting, Miss Sheppard contrived toproduce the typescript of the evidence with great rapidity, so that it was complete and available for study some time before we left Colombo. Forthese services, and for her helpful contribution to the success of many ofour social engagements, we express our grateful thanks.421. Miss Sheppard&apos;s only relief was provided . by Mr. Murugupillai ofColombo, and by the Hansard Reporters of the State Council, for the loan of whose services on several occasions we are indebted to the Speaker, the hon. Sir Waitialingam Duraiswamy. To him, and the Hon. Sir RobertDrayton, Chief Secretary,&apos; and the Hon. Mr. D. S. Senanayake, Leader ofthe State Council, our thanks are also due for having so kindly made availableto us offices in the State Council Building during a &quot;period of great shortage.42.2. On pur return to the United Kingdom, we were glad: to take advantageof accommodation offered to us in the Welsh National Temple of Peace and health, Cathays Park, Cardiff, for the writing of our Report. We are greatlyindebted to the Welsh National Council of &quot;the League of Nations Union,and to Major Edgar Jones, O.B.E., M.A., Warden of the Temple, for thusenabling us to enjoy all the advantages of modern office accommodation indelightful surroundings which the Temple provides.423. We owe a special word of gratitude to our Secretary-Shorthandwriter,Miss P. M. Miller, whose services were lent to us by the Air Ministry&quot;. MissMiller curried out a variety of duties, social as well as official, in London,&quot;in Ceylon and at all stages of our many journeys, with&apos; admirable efficiency and success. She handled our very considerable social and personal corres-pondence with great skill and. was largely responsible for the arrangement of.
our programme of Public Sessions to the mutual satisfaction alike of ourselves and the witnesses who appeared before us. The rapidity and accuracy withwhich she has produced the various drafts of our Report have contributedgready to the shortening of the time required for its completion.,424. Throughout the period of our stay in Ceylon liaison between theCommission and the Ceylon Government on all matters was maintained byMr. E:&apos; R. Sudbury,-O.B.E., of the Ceylon Civil. Service, to whose unrivalled&quot;local knowledge and experience we owe much useful advice on both official and personal matters., In addition to supervising our finances and arrangingsome of our tours, Mr. Sudbury was indefatigable in the production andcorrelation of the various statistics and other data we found it necessary tocall for from time &quot;to time, which&quot; in many cases involved detailed and pains-taking research; and our sincere thanks are due to him for his valuable help,and to the Ceylon authorities for the loan of his services.425. In conclusion, we desire to lay particular emphasis upon the invaluableservices rendered to our Commission and ourselves by our Secretary, Mr.Trafford Smith, and to express our deep-sense of obligation to him. Fromthe moment of our appointment and throughout all our labours in ceylon and at home, we have been immensely impressed by his powers of organisationand by his tireless industry, combined with unfailing tact and discretion andconstant cheerfulness and good humour.His knowledge of official procedure and Colonial practice was of the utmostassistance to us, and we are greatly indebted to him for the help which heihas given to&apos;us in the drafting of our Report. We are glad to be able topay this unstinted tribute to the outstanding services which he has rendered to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to ourselves.426. We now have the &quot;honour to submit our Report for your consideration.SOULBURY.J. F. REES.F. J.

APPENDIX I.CEYLON.SESSIONAL PAPER XIV.-1944.        . .SEPTEMBER.   1944.REFROM OF THE CONSTITUTION(I)Explanatory Memorandum dated 11th September, 1944, on the ConstitutionalScheme formulated by the Ministers in accordance with His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentsDeclaration of 26th May, 1943, and subsequently withdrawn.The task which the Ministers undertook in the statement read by , the Leaderin the State Council on the 8th June, 1943,* -was the production of a constitution which satisfied the conditions set out in the Declaration issued by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on 26th May, 1943, as interpreted in the Ministers&apos; Statement. TheState Council at its meeting on the 26th March, 1942, had resolved that &quot; This Councildemands the conferment of Dominion Status on Ceylort after the war and requeststhat the British Government should give an assurance to that effect as has beendone in the case of certain other British possessions.&apos;,,&apos; The Ministers forwardedthis resolution to the Governor for transmission to the Secretary of State, statingthat they were in entire accord with it. J The Declaration of-1943 was a reply to this and other representations. The Ministers would have preferred to have drafted a constitution of their own but, for the&apos;reasons given in the Ministers&apos; Statement, they thought that the offer made in the Declaration should be accepted.The Form of the Constitution. - -2. The Declaration of 1943 stated that/once victory was achieved, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would &quot;proceed ]to the examination by a suitable commission orconference of such detailed proposals as the Ministers may in the meantime havebeen able to formulate in the way of. a complete constitutional scheme.&quot; It wasalso stated that the grant of &quot;full responsible Government under the Crown in all matters of internal civil administration&quot; would be &quot;by Order of His Majesty inCouncil.&quot; The Ministers thought it desirable&apos; that they should make their proposals in the form in which they would be put into effect if the two conditions stated inparagraph (7) of the Declaration of 1943 were satisfied, namely, upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment being satisfied that they were in full compliance with paragraphs (1) to(6) of the Declaration, and upon their subsequent approval by three quarters of allthe members of the State &apos;Council, excluding the Officers of State and the^ Speaker.Accordingly, the draft takes the form of an Order in Council. &apos; &apos;3. As Article 3 provides, this Order in Council would supersede the Ceylon (state council) Order in Council, 1931, under which the present Constitution operates.It would take effect on the date of publication in the Gazette, which would be&quot; the date of operation &quot;. A great deal would have to be done, however, before thepresent Constitution was superseded. First, it would be necessary to appoint aDelimitation Commission and to secure the delimitation of the new electoral districtsunder Articles 12 and 13. Secondly, it would be necessary to get a new ElectionsOrder in Council made referred to in Article 16 (2) as the Ceylon (Elections) Orderin Council, 1944 and to get registers of electors prepared in accordance with its terms. Thirdly, the State Council would be dissolved and a Parliament summonedunder Article 24. Pourthly, a general  election would be held under Article 16 and additional members would be appointed under Article 17. The machinery of theConstitution would then be in operation, and the Governor or Governor-general would-be able to appoint a. Prime Minister and other Ministers under Article 43.Accordingly, a Proclamation would be issued fixing an &quot; appointed day &apos;,&apos;. On that day the Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council, 1931, would be revoked in accordancewith Article 3 (except for its financial provisions which would, under Article 55continue in operation until the end of the financial year); the functions of theOfficers of State and Executive Committees would be &quot;transferred to Ministers underArticle 53 (1); and generally the new Constitution, other than its financial provisions,would come into operation.The Question of a Second Chamber4. The Ministers came to. the conclusion that the question of a Second Chamberwas so controversial that a 75 per cent, majority could not be obtained for any suchplan.   Not only would there be controversy whether a Second Chamber was desirable* Hereinafter referred to as &quot; the Ministers Statement &quot;. , See S.P. XVII of 1943, No. (2).f Hereinafter referred to as &quot; the Declaration of 1943 &quot;. See S.P. XVII of 1943, No; (i).j S.P. XIII of 1943, Nos. 14 and i8a.
but also, if the majority opinion favoured a Second Chamber, there would be con-troversy over its composition. It may be noted that even in the United Kingdomthere has been argument on these questions since i860; and for nearly forty years the. preamble to the Parliament Act has stated an intention to-create a &quot;popular&quot;Second Chamber in place of the House of Lords. . A conference in 1917 failed toreach any kind of agreement, and since 1935 one of the political parties has had theabolition of the House of Lords as one of the items of its programme. - If there was such disagreement inGreat Britain, there was unlikely to be greater agreement, in ceylon, which has&apos;never had a bicameral legislature. Accordingly, the ministers decided that the simplest solution .. would be to retain a unicameral legislature butto authorise-by Article b-the: new legislature&apos; to establish a Senate by ordinarylegislation.   In that way a simple majority of the members&apos;voting would be required.5. In formulating their tentative proposals, the Ministers agreed that the minority--   communities ought to have additional weightage, but it was also agreed that every member should be elected as a Ceylonese, not. as a Sinhalese, a Tamil, a- Muslim,- a&apos; Burgher, an Indian or a European&apos;. .  The Ministers agreed with the DonoughmofeCommission that communal representation as such was undesirable.6. A consideration of the -distribution of the communities produced the solution which is embodied in Article 13. The great majority of the Sinhalese are to be-foundin the densely populated- areas, especially in the Western ahd Southern Provinces.The great majority of the Tamils&quot; and Muslims are to be found in the less, densely populated areas. Also, it was desirable that the Kandyan rural population shouldhave special- consideration. It will be seen that these aims can be attained withoutcommunal representation by giving weightage to AREA as well as to population.7. The Ministers decided, that the legislature should consist of approximately one hundred members. Article 13 therefore provides that each . Province shall have,one member for every 75,000 inhabitants at the census of 1931, with an additionalmember for every 1,000 square miles of area.   The result would be as follows: Western ProvinceCentral Province ...Southern Province      &quot;...Northern Province        ...Eastern Province ...North-Western Province ;North-Central Province ...Uva Province     ...       ...Sabaragarnuwa ProvinceTotal &apos; ..The delimitation of electoral districts within the Provinces would be undertaken by aDelimitation Commission appointed (Article 12) by -the Governor and consisting ofthe Chief Justice or a Puisne Judge as Chairman and two other persons who are notto be members of the State Council. The Commission is directed by Article 13 (3)to provide &quot; that each electoral district in&apos;the Province shall have as nearly as may bean equal number of persons, but shall also take- into account the transport facilities of the Province, its physical features and the community or diversity of interest ofits inhabitants &quot;.- This community or diversity of interest may be economic or it may be social. On the average, each constituency would be about one-half the size of the present constituencies; but in the less thiokly populated Provinces it wouldbe much less than one-half.Thus, the North-Central Province would. have five members instead of one, andthe Northern Province and the Eastern Province together would have 16 membersinstead of 6. Accordingly, it would be much easier than it is at present to providerepresentation  for  homogeneous economic and social groups.&amp;. Articles 14 and 15 provide for a revision of constituencies after every censusso that, as the population grows, the electoral districts would be adapted accordingly.If there were a census in 1946 it is-probable that the number of electoral districtswould be increased to 105.9. No system of territorial representation would necessarily ensure that all sectionsof the community would be adequately represented.. Article 17 therefore authorisesthe. Governor-General, acting in his discretion, to appoint up to six members where he. considers that any important interest is not adequately represented. In accordancewith Article 36 . (3), Where the Governor-General acte in his discretion he mustrefer the matter to the Prime Minister for advice, &quot;but&quot; he is not bound to accept&apos;that advice. :Sumber for Number for Total.Population.

Representation. .&quot;ib; The Ministers gave long and anxious consideration to the question of repre-sentation in the legislature. It was incumbent on thein to produce a scheme; butthey saw no reason why the whole Constitution should fail if the necessary majoritycould not be obtained in the State Council. Accordingly, they informed Has excellency the Governor as follows: -&quot;Representation.- This question is dealt with in Articles 12 and 13.. TheMinisters propose to put those Articles separately to the State Council. If those proposals do not receive the three-fourths majority and if the requisite, -majoritycannot be obtained for any other alternative proposal, the Ministers propose tomove&quot; in the State Council that a Commission be appointed by Your Excellency todetermine the distribution of electoral districts in the Island in accordance withprinciples, which will be set out in the motion. -&quot;The Hon. Mr. Mahadeva, Minister of Home Affairs, wishes it to be statedthat lie is not in agreement with the proposals regarding the question of repre-sentation and is of the. opinion that the entirety of this question, which is amatter of considerable ,controversy, should be settled by a Royal Commission.&quot;The Legislature. . ,  &apos; &apos;11. The names chosen for the legislature, the First Chamber and the second chamber (if one was established) were respectively the Parliament of Ceylon, theCouncil of State, and the Senate. In accordance with Dominion practice the King(and not the Governor-General) is part of the legislature though for most purposeshe acts through the Governor-General. Accordingly, Article 5 provides -that the parliament of Ceylon shall consist of the King and the Council of State; but if parliament provides by law for the- establishment of a Senate, Parliament shallconsist, so long as such law is in operation, of the King, the Senate, and the Councilof-State. .-.,:&apos;: *.     , - -       , &apos;..&apos;,...&apos; -12. The legislative power conferred by Article 7 is the widest possible power &apos;&quot; authority as ample as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power couldbestow&quot;.  It is in fact limited  only by: (a)   such Acts: of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as extend or mayextend to Ceylon; &apos;(5) the provisions of Article 8; and(c) the provisions of Article. 10 (2) which require a two-thirds majority for a constitutional amendment.The provisions usually inserted in colonial constitutions, empowering the King inCouncil to revoke or amend the Constitution, has not been included in the draft,which could therefore be amended only by Imperial legislation or in&apos; accordance with article 10. * It may be noted that Parliament is not forbidden to legislate on matterson which the Governor-General is also authorised-&apos;to legislate in accordance with theDeclaration of 1943.&quot; , -13. Article 8 is a general protection to minorities, whether racial, social or religious.This being a restriction on legislative power,  it would be for the courts to say.- whether the Article was infringed, and they could  declare an Act of the CeylonParliament to be invalid if it contravened the Article.   It is phased on a provision in  the  Constitution  of Northern&apos; Ireland. &quot;...14. Article io&apos; (1). gives a power to repeal or amend any provision of an Order-in-Council in force in the Island. Orders-in-Council under Imperial legislation are excluded because the King cannot by a Prerogative Order-in^Council (such as this constitution would be) amend or revoke ail Order-in-Council authorised by theImperial Parliament. Since no power for the purpose is reserved, Orders-in-Councilapplying to Ceylon could be made-after this Constitution took effect only if theywere authorised by Act of the Imperial Parliament.-15. Article 10 (2) contains the-general power of constitutional amendment. Thereare specific powers elsewhere; thus Article 6 (2) authorises the amendments necessaryto create a Senate, and these can be passed by.a simple majority;, again, &quot;the phrase&quot; until Parliament otherwise provides &quot; (e.g,, in. relation to privileges in Article 30)implies that Parliament- can otherwise provide by simple majority. Where thereis no such -special provision,-the amendment must be express and it must be passedby two-thirds of the whole Council. Thus, if there were 95 elected members and nominated members, it would be necessary to get 67 votes for a constitutionalamendment.The Council of State. .16. Under Article 18, any person who is qualified to be . an - elector, and not dis-qualified, might be elected or appointed to the Council.  Attention is particularlydrawn to the following points regarding the rules relating to &apos; disqualifications: (a) ability to speak, read and write English &quot;is no longer required;
(fe) the rule as to contracts has been tightened up;s -(g) disqualification on account of imprisonment is limited to sentences of threemonths or longer and to certain offences only (mainly of a non-political nature)under the Penal Code; the period of such disqualification-is also limited to aperiod of seven years after expiry of the sentence;(d) the disqualification for accepting a bribe or a gratification offered with aview to influencing a Member&apos;s- judgment as a Member of the Council is a newprovision.17. Since the Council of State will not be an executive body, the practice of having a continuous session which is peculiar to the State Council, is brought to an end.A Parliament may last for five years, but may be dissolved before -then. There will,however, be a session every year, as in the case of the Parliaments of the UnitedKingdom and the Dominions, each session being terminated by a &quot; prorogation &quot;which brings current business to; an end and requires the issue of a Proclamationfor a new session. This is necessary to clear the Order Paper of derelict and ^obsoletemotions and to enable the Cabinet (who will be responsible for all government business) to plan the official business of each session. The Council of State will itself, provide for adjournment within the limits of a session. The details are set out in articles. 25 to 27.The Governor-General.n8. The Ministers assumed that the Governor would be replaced by a Governor-General, and the standard clauses of Dominion Constitutions have been inserted in articles 3.3 to 35. The self-government to be conferred under the Declaration of1943, is, however, self-government only &quot;in all matters of INTERNAL civil administration.&quot; In order to satisfy paragraphs (2) to (6) of the Declarations asinterpreted by the Ministers&apos; Statement, it has been necessary to insert unusual powers in Articles 38 and 39, though they have been carefully defined by these articles and Article 40. These powers the Governor-General must be able to exercise accord-ing to his discretion and subject to instructions from the Secretary of State. Incertain other cases, too, it is necessary to give the Governor-General a discretiont(though not subject to instructions from London) in order that minority interestsmay not feel that there is any likelihood of their being prejudiced under the newConstitution. Accordingly,, the Governor-General may also act in his discretion in the following matters:(a) Appointment of Delimitation Commission   (Article 14);\b) Appointment  of Additional   (minority)  members to  the Council of State(Article 17);(c) Appointment   and removal of members of the Public Services Commission(Article 62);      -(d) Appointment   and   removal   of   members   of   the   Judicial   Commission(Article 68); V(e) Appointment of Chief Justice and Puisne Judges  of the Supreme Court(Article 68)...The intention in these cases is &quot;to take the appointments out of politics&quot;. Inaccordance with Article 36 (3), the Governor-General will consult the Prime Minister,but will not be bound to accept the advice and will act in his discretion.19. In. respect of certain classes of appointments to be made by the Governor-General, it was thought that it should be specifically stated on whose recommenda-tion the. appointments should be made: These matters are regulated by long-standing conventions in Great Britain, -but no such conventions have as yet beenestablished in Ceylon owing to the peculiar position of the Officers of State and theExecutive Committees.    The following are the cases: (a) Clerk of Parliament&apos;(Article 312); -(fe) Ministers other than Prime Minister (Article 43);(c) Deputy Ministers (Article 45);... (d) Secretary to the Cabinet (Article 5.2);(e) Permanent Secretaries (Article 53);(/) Secretary to the Public  Services  Commission   (Article  63);(g) Public Officers (Article 64); &apos;(h) Judicial Officers (Article 69).Except in respect of (/), (g) and (h) this is merely a formal enactment of the Britishconventions while (/), (g) and (h) have been specially provided for in order thatminority interests may be assured of absolute impartiality in the filling of publicappointments. In all these cases Article 36 (2) provides that the Governor-general shall.act only in the recommendation of the person or body authorised to make it,but may lefer the recommendation back to that person or body.
X9&amp;zp. All other cases are covered by Article 36 (1), which simply applies, the Britishconventions relating 1 to responsible&apos; government. These conventions are! also. inoperation in the Dominions and there are plenty of precedents (which: have been collected-in the books) to coverall except the most unusual circumstances. Theseprecedents would be applied in Ceylon until a definite set of Ceylon precedents: hadbeen established.   - &quot;&quot;2,1. Article&quot;37 provides for the royal assent to Bills in accordance with similarprovisions in: the Dominion Constitutions, except that no power to reserve for theKing&apos;s assent has been inserted. Such reservation is no ^longer practised in theDominions except in the Australian States and in New Zealand. The cases wherereservation will be permitted have been defined in the Declaration of 1943 and areproved for by Article 3.8. The language is that-of the existing Royal instructions,except as to paragraph (a), which is a new provision required by the Declaration.-22. Article 39 is required .by the Declaration of 1945 but it has been very closelydefined, and must be read with Article 40, which makes certain that important matters of internal civil administration are not brought within Article 39. It is.made cjear in Article 39 that the existence of the Governor-General&apos;s power to legislate will not prevent the Parliament of Ceylon from legislating, but if an ordinaryBUT is repugnant to a Governor-General&apos;s Ordinance it may be reserved for the royal assent. Article 41 deals with the validity of -reservation or of a Governor-General&apos;6Ordinance. &quot;The Executive Government.23. Part V of the draft provides for &quot;responsible government in all matters ofinternal civil administration &quot; as required by the Declaration of 1943. As. in theDominions, the, executive power is vested in the King by Article 42, but will beexercised in legal theory by the Governor-General and in practice by the cabinet and responsible Ministers. Articles 43 to 50 ,are in substance common form: in, theDominions, providing for Ministers and Deputy Ministers on the usual assumptionsof responsible government. The provision. of Article 44 that Defence and external affairs are ministerial functions needs, to be specially mentioned. Though in accord-ance with Articles 391 to 41, these subjects will be the special concern of the Governor-General, the Ministers have insisted that ALL functions of government shall be within the purview of the Cabinet and the Parliament of Ceylon. Articles 46 to 50are common form. .24. Though it is neither British nor - Dominion practice formally to establish theCabinet by law, it has been thought desirable to So so in Ceylon and to make all-Ministers (but not Deputy ,Ministers)&apos;members of it. In- view of the&apos; fact that theSecretary of the Board of Ministers has also been Clerk to the State Council andthat this is contrary to parliamentary practice. Article 52 makes special provisionfor a Cabinet Office.25. Article 53 is partly transitional. Since both the Officers of State&apos; and theExecutive Committees will disappear in accordance with the provisions for&quot;responsible government&quot; &quot;in the Declaration of 1943, their functions must betransferred to Ministers. The Departments of Government are however not at presentorganised for ministerial control, and an Executive Committee may have the general direction and control of as many as seven separate Departments. In the ministerialsystem the Minister has only one Department which is politically in his control andadministratively in the control of his Permanent Secretary. Administrative as wellas political co-ordination are thus achieved, and a clear distinction is drawn betweenpolities and administration. Article 53 (2) brings this into operation as a transitionalmeasure,, and Article 53 (3)&apos; provides for a permanent arrangement. Article 54is merely consequential.Financial Provisions.26. Article 55 brings the financial clauses into operation at the end of the financialyear so as to avoid a disturbance in financial business. The. major change in financial organisation is the establishment of a Consolidated-Fund under Article 58.The advantages are not merely a matter of accounting.:, For instance, it enables a clear distinction to be drawn between expenditure of such constitutional importance that it ought to be permanently &quot;charged on the Consolidated Fund and thenormal expenditure, of the year, all of which should be voted by Parliament evenif it is payable out of Loan Funds. The present financial procedure of the Islandis&apos; in- some measure a relic of colonial days. In Great Britain and the Dominions_a.ll expenditure which -is not charged on the Consolidated Fund is voted by theAnnual Appropriation Act.or by a supplementary Appropriation Act (or consolidate fund Act). The State Council, on the other hand, votes from Loan, Funds- andapproves Supplementary estimates by. simple resolution. Article-58 brings1 the Britishand Dominion practice into operation.   The remainder-of Part V is common form.
The Public Service..27. In view of the importance of securing impartiality in appointments to. thepublic service, the Ministers decided to establish an independent Public services commission of three persons, as provided by Article 62. In accordancee with article 64, every new appointment to a post carrying a salary of Rs. 3,600 or morewill be made on the recommendation of the Commission, which- may also/accept responsibility for any other appointment or class of appointment. All appointmentsnot made by the Commission will be reported to the Commission and may be revokedon the recommendation of the Commission.The Judicial Authorities. &apos;28. Similarly, a Judicial Commission is provided, by Article 68. It will beresponsible for all judicial appointments except those of the Chief Justice and thePuisne Judges of the Supreme Court, who will be appointed by the Governor-general in his discretion. Articles 69 and 71 give the judges of the Supreme Court the usualindependent position. &quot;Conclusion.29. The constitutional scheme provided by the Ministers was thus simple in its composition and would have been flexible in its operation. Though, drafted inprecise language in order that the discussions at the &quot;commission or conference &quot;contemplated by the Declaration of 1943, might have been held on a text and hot ohgeneral resolutions, it had not been checked by a -legal draftsman, and the Ministersinformed His Excellency the Governor that any legal pruning that, might be necessarycould be undertaken after His &apos;. Majesty&apos;s Government had been satisfied that it.conformed with the requirements of the Declaration of 1943. Subject to the require-ments of the Declaration and of the special conditions of the Island, the draft provides a simple Constitution of the recognised Dominion type. The Ministers have with-,drawn it not because they would have had any-hesitation in recommending it to theState Council, but because, in their opinion. His Majesty&apos;s Government has failedto carry out the&quot; undertaking given in the Declaration of 1943. The Ministers havenow authorised publication in order to show that they have fully and conscientiouslycarried out the mandate conferred on them by the Declaration.&apos; *        &apos; (II,)?THE CONSTITUTIONAL&apos; SCHEME FORMULATED BY  THE ministers in ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTS -..DECLARATION OF 26TH MAY, 1943.THE   CONSTITUTION   OF   CEYLON..1 Part   I.

The population of the Island on 26th February, 1931, for all races is that returned at the partial Census on that date. The correspondingpopulation on 31st December, 1941, is based on natural increase (excess of births over deaths) and the excess or reverse of immigrants over emigrants.2. The population for each race and religion is estimated on the assumption that the distribution remained the same as at the Census of 1921. Theassumption may be considered fairly satisfactory for all the races except Indian Tamils and Indian Moors whose population is affected by migration.

Preparatory work has started upon a further comprehensivecensus, to be undertaken in 1946.During the war years attention has been concentrated upon rubber, tea, and foodproduction.

APPENDIX XCOST OF LIVING STATISTICSThere is no general Cost of Living Index in Ceylon ; in fact, the great variety of conditionsthroughout the Island would make the compilation of a general index practically impossible.The general trend of prices in the War Years, however, may be gathered from two specialindices the Cost of Living Index Working Class, Colombo Town and the Cost of living index -Estate Labourers.(1) Cost of Living Index Working Class, Colombo Town.The basis of this index up to 1942 was a family budget survey of 251 working class families in Colombo Town carried out by the Statistics Branch of. the Department of commerce and Industries. Thereafter the index is based on an artificial budget prepared by a SpecialCommittee of the War Council. The details of the budget are given in Sessional PaperXVI of 1943. Since this index provides the only authoritative figures for the cost ofliving it was adopted as the basis for the payment of War Allowances to government servants in receipt of less than a stated salary per mensem.Cost of Living Index Working Class Colombo Town.i(Average Price November 1938 April, 1939 100)   .1939January ,    ...       ...       ...

SECRET.C. (45) 1st Meeting.CABINET.Golonial Affairs Committee.MINUTES of a Meeting held on Tuesday, 28th August, 1945, at 3 p.m.Present:The Eight Hon. A. Greenwood, M.P., Lord Privy Seal (in the Chair).The Right Hon. Viscount Addison,Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.The Right Hon. G. H. Hall, M.P.,Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Right Hon. Lord Pethick-Lawrence, Secretary of State forIndia and for Burma.Mr. J. B. Hynd, M.P., Chancellor ofthe duchy of Lancaster.The following were also present:The Right Hon. A. V. AlexanderM.P., First Lord of the Admiralty.The Right Hon. J. J. Lawson, M.P.Secretary of State for War.The Right Hon. Lord Jowitt, LordChancellor.The Right Hon. Viscount Stansgate,Secretary of State for Air.Secretariat :Sir Gilbert Laithwaite (Cabinet Office).Mr. Trafford Smith (Colonial Office).THE Committee had before them a memorandum (C. (45) 2, dated23rd August) by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the Ceylonconstitution.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it was urgent to get decisions on theproposals covered by the Colonial Secretary&apos;s paper with a view to discussions between the Colonial Secretary and Mr. Senanayake. If it was possible to reach agreement that day, arrangements could then be made for the matter to be takenin Cabinet on Thursday, the 30th August.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES briefly reviewed the history of constitutional development in Ceylon in recent years withparticular reference to the recommendations of the Donoughmore Commissionof 1931. The system of Executive Committees which had been adopted on therecommendation of that Commission had been a very interesting constitutionalexperiment of which great hopes had at one stage been entertained. practical experience, however, over the last 14 years had shown that it was not in facta sound or workable solution of the problems of Ceylon and the Report of the Soulbury Commission brought out the weaknesses which time had shown in it.He found himself in complete agreement with the Commission that, in thelight of experience, we must now consider a different form of government forCeylon. He thought the proposals put forward by the Commission, as brieflyanalysed in C. (45) 2, were, broadly speaking, on the right lines. The mostimportant problem was that of the minorities, but he felt that the safeguardsproposed were adequate to protect their interests. The most difficult issue whichthe Committee would have to consider was the proposal that a three-fourthsmajority of the State Council should be required for the proposed newconstitution, having regard to the terms of the Declaration made by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in 1943.[30430b] b
Publication of Report of Soulbury Commission.The Committee first considered the arguments for and against immediatepublication of the Eeport of the Soulbury Commission. In favour of publication iit was suggested that there would be advantage in giving full publicity to the Ivery valuable report that had been framed. Was it not desirable that all 1concerned should have an opportunity in the light of the Eeport of appreciating Ithe difficulties of the situation and the arguments for the course of action Irecommended ? IIt was suggested, on the other hand, that the balance of advantage rested 1with refraining from publication until His Majesty&apos;s Government had reached their own conclusions and were in a position to release them. Prematurepublication might result in the development of a campaign of agitation againstthe proposals in the Report, and it would probably improve the chances of their acceptance if it was possible for them to be considered confidentially by thoseprimarily concerned before they were released to the press.After further discussion, the Committee agreed that the balance of advantagewas against publication at this stage.Communal Composition of the State Council.THE LORD CHANCELLOR drew attention to the difference between thefigures given for. the representation in the State Council of the various com-munities as set out in Annexure 2 of C. (45) 2 and those given in the SoulburyReport. The Annexure to C. (45) 2 showed forty Sinhalese, six Ceylon Tamils,two Indian Tamils and one Muslim, while the Report (paragraph 252) showedthirty-nine Sinhalese, eight Ceylon Tamils, two Indian Tamils and one Muslim.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES explained that thefigures contained in C. (45) 2 were taken from an earlier proof of the report which had since been corrected in the light of information received from Ceylonwhich conforms with the latest position. He added, further, that the figure of six Ceylon Tamils in C. (45) 2 did not include the Speaker of the Council; whowas a Ceylon Tamil.The Committee Took note of the explanations given by the Colonial Secretary.Shall acceptance by three-quarters of the members of the State Council be acondition of final acceptance of any scheme of constitutional reform fA general discussion took place on this issue.The Committee were reminded that in their Declaration of 1943 HisMajesty&apos;s Government had laid it down that the final acceptance of any schemeof constitutional reform formulated by Ministers should be conditional inter aliaon its acceptance by three-quarters of the members of the State Council.Ministers had thereafter drafted a scheme which they subsequently withdrew.That scheme, however, did form the background of many of the recommendationsof the Soulbury Commission. There was reason to think now that Mr. Senanayakewould urge that, while the three-quarters proviso might reasonably have beeninsisted upon for*a locally devised scheme, since the recommendations of theCommission would represent a constitution which had not in fact been devisedby Ministers or in Ceylon, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be free to approveit provided they were satisfied that the minorities&apos; interests were adequatelysafeguarded, whether or not it obtained a three-quarters majority on presentation to the State Council.In favour of retaining the three-quarters majority it was urged that thiswas an issue of the greatest importance from the point of view of the minorities.While the proposed constitution embodied certain other safeguards, chiefly thereserve powers of the Governor, those safeguards would be unlikely by themselvesto reassure the minority feeling, which would regard the requirement of a three-quarters vote as the safeguard of outstanding importance. It was relevant inthis connection that the figure of three-quarters had appeared in the declaration made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1943 and had been before the public since then. If we were now to withdraw it, it was only to be expected that the suspicionsof the minorities would be aroused and that their reaction might be sharplyhostile.It ivas pointed out on the other hand that (1) His Maiesty&apos;s Government were not in terms bound by the Declarationof 1943 in this regard since the scheme under consideration was onedevised by an independent Commission and not by Ministers in Ceylon.
His Majesty&apos;s Government were perfectly at liberty to approve any scheme such as that now before them so long as the minorities were,in their view, properly safeguarded under it and it was in other respects satisfactory.(2) The scheme put forward by Ministers and subsequently withdrawn, forwhich alone under the 1943 Declaration a three-quarters majority would have been requisite, had been devised without consultation withthe minorities. The Soulbury Commission, on the other hand, hadtaken special pains to ascertain minority feeling. That commission had now confidentially informed the Secretary of State for the colonies that it would, in their view7, be quite impracticable to insist upon athree-quarters majority for the constitutional scheme which they had proposed. It was explained in this connection that the Sinhalesemajority in the State Council was unlikely in any circumstances to vote solidly in favour of the Soulbury proposals. A minority (whichmight be as much as one-third) of the Sinhalese members wouldprobably oppose those recommendations on the ground that they didnot go far enough in the direction of Dominion status.(3) Mr. Senanayake would not be prepared to accept the requirement of athree-quarters majority. On the other hand, if we were to get the Soulbury proposals through the State Council we could only hope todo so by his help. It was pointed out in this connection that no certainty could be felt at this stage that opinion in Ceylon would infact regard even the Soulbury recommendations as going sufficientlyfar. The recent constitutional pledges given to Burma and the. constitutional advance made in India had struck the imagination ofthe Sinhalese. They claimed to have given a fuller degree of co-opera-tion in the war than either India or Burma, and felt that they shouldnot lag behind either of those countries in constitutional progress. Inthese circumstances, if for any reason we were unable to put the Soulbury recommendations before the State Council and secure its support for them now, the chances of their being accepted at a later stage were exceedingly small.(4) The Soulbury recommendations were the only alternative to a constitu-tion imposed from outside. The practical difficulties of imposing a constitution were likely to be great. Apart from that there was muchpolitical advantage in avoiding any appearance of imposing a constitution.The General sense of the Committee after discussion was that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should carefully avoid any suggestion that they were themselvesspontaneously abandoning the requirement of a three-quarters majority which hadfigured (though admittedly in different circumstances) in their Declaration of1943. If, on the other hand (as was anticipated by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies) Mr. Senanayake himself in discussion raised this matter, therewould be no objection to the Secretary of State being given a discretion to inform him that it should, in his view, be Mr. Senanayake&apos;s object to secure the maximum possible majority in the State Council for the Souibury proposals; that thatmajority should preferably include the largest possible element of minorityrepresentation; and that on this understanding His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldnot necessarily insist on holding to the three-quarters majority of the Declarationof 1943.The suggestion was made in this connection that there might be advantage in working to a two-thirds as opposed to a three-quarters majority. The general feeling of the Committee Avas, however, that within the terms of their generalscheme the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be left full discretion inthe matter and should not be tied by being required to work to any fixedpercentage.Miscellan Carbonaceous Po in is.The Committee proceeded to consider certain outstanding points, asfollows : (1) Consultation with the Government of India.It was suggested, and the Committee agreed, that advantage should be taken of Lord WavelTs presence in this country to keep him in touch with the general position in regard to the Soulbury recommendations and the action proposed on[30430b] b 2
them. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA undertook to make thenecessary arrangements.The Committee approved the recommendation contained in paragraph 14of C. (45) 2 that the text of the Soulbury Report should be made available to theGovernor-General of India and his Executive Council confidentially at the sametime as it became available to the members of the Board of Ministers in Ceylon.The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to adjust with the Secretaryof State for India the period of time within which the Government of india should be desired to formulate their conclusions on the Report.(2) Defence.The Service Ministers informed the Committee that they regarded theprovisions for defence embodied in the Souibury Report as generally adequate and satisfactory.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR enquired to whom the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 352 would be paid and pressed theimportance of ensuring that the proposed Defence Minister did not interferewith R.A.F. requirements. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THECOLONIES pointed out in this connection that under the terms of paragraph 352of the Soulbury Report the position was fully protected. As regards local defence,he explained in reply to an enquiry that Ceylon had a Ceylon Defence Forceand a local R.N.V.R. detachment, and that it was proposed to continue these forces in being.(3) Civil Aviation.THE LORD CHANCELLOR enquired the position as regards civil aviation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES explained that thiswas covered by the reservation in respect of communications referred to in para-graph 6 (d) of C. (45) 2.(4) Question of style of the Governor&apos; of Ceylon.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE DOMINIONS drew the atten-tion of the Committee to the suggestion which had been put forward by SinhaleseMinisters that the Governor of Ceylon should in future be styled Governor-General. The Dominions Office felt that to accept this recommendation wouldhave very embarrassing reactions in the Dominions and in other territories of comparable status. It was relevant that neither Newfoundland nor SouthernRhodesia had a Governor-General. Governor appeared to be the proper stylefor Ceylon. It was explained that in putting forward this recommendationSinhalese Ministers had been actuated by considerations of prestige. The general sense of the Committee, in the light of the considerations advanced by the Secretaryof State for the Dominions, was, however, that the balance of advantage was against any change in the title of the Governor.(5) Channel of Communication between the Ceylon Government andHis Majesty&apos;s Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE DOMINIONS pointed outthat the Commission at page 116, paragraph 37, of their Report, &quot; had recom-mended that in certain circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom should communicate direct with the Prime Minister of Ceylon.&quot; Givengeneral practice throughout the Empire, there seemed great difficulty about this.Was it not important to safeguard the position of the Governor and also thatof the Secretary of State for the Colonies? The general sense of the Committeewas that there was great force in the arguments produced by the dominions secretary and that, as in the case of territories of comparable status, com-munications should be addressed to and by His Majesty&apos;s Government throughthe channel of the Governor and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(6) Nominated Members.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCFIY OF LANCASTER enquire whether it was proposed that there should in any case be six nominated members or whether this was to be a maximum? THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOETHE COLONIES confirmed that while Ministers had contemplated a maximum of six, the proposal now recommended for approval was that there should besix nominated members in any event.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER enquire whether the nominated members should be nominated by the Governor in con-sultation with the Prime Minister, and drew the attention of the Committeeto the arguments in favour of such an arrangement. The general sense of theCommittee was, however, that as this was a discretionary function any obliga-tion on the Governor to consult his Ministers regarding nominations would be undesirable in principle. It might, apart from this, be misunderstood by the minorities. The balance of advantage rested with avoiding any such limitation on his freedom of action. It should not be overlooked that the Prime minister would represent the majority community.(7) Safeguards for Minorities.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER enquire whether, given the safeguard represented by the existence of a second Chamber,it was necessary to include in the classes of reserved Bills Bills which had&quot; evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which inthe Governor-General&apos;s opinion were likely to involve oppression or unfairnessto any community,&quot; as proposed in paragraph 332 of the Report. There was general agreement that this was a safeguard of great importance with which itwould not be wise to dispense.Report to the Cabinet.After further discussion, the Committee invited the Chairman on their behalf to draft and submit to the Prime Minister, with a view to consideration in Cabinet on Thursday, the 30th August, if arrangements could be made for this,a report covering the points taken in the discussion, and recommending that theSecretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to enter into discussions with Mr. Senanayake on the basis of the Soulbury Commission recommendations,subject to the modifications approved by the Committee in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th August, 1945.
