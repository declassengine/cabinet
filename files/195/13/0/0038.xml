C.24(55)							15th March, 1955



		1.	European Defence : Four-Power Meeting.



A.E.	Submitted draft reply to W’ton.



P.M.	Attached importce. to words “top-level” Mtg.  Want to elucidate wtr E. wd. participate himself.  That wd. influence my attitude profoundly.



A.E.	His reluctance to participate is based on objns. to Woodrow Wilson and FDR.’s attendance at such mtgs.



P.M.	The second ques is timing – “early date” or June.

	How long before polling day is a Dissolution?



W.	21 days is minimum legal interval.  



H.M.  	Betwn. 17 and 21 days. not counting Sundays.  



P.M.  	And customary to give some notice of Dissolution.  Thus, working back from 26/5, Dissolution wd. need to be announced about 14 or 15/4.  This excludes my earlier thought of suggesting E.’s visit shd. be in April.



A.E.	Also v. soon after ratification.  Our arguments in draft are that May is too early.  We cdn’t therefore suggest April as alternative.



P.M.	Then I accept 2nd. alternative in draft telegram.



	P.M.  Stated his intentions.

							[Enter de L. &amp; C.A.S.





		2.	Turko-Iraq Pact.



A.E.	This is moment to go fwd.

	Anglo-U.S. talks on future policy twds Israel &amp; Arab States have bn. v. successful &amp; we now have agreed plan.  Wd. have launched it last week, had it not bn. for Gaza incident.

	This fits into that pattern.

	Will secure solid advantages for us, tho’ dressed up for Iraq consumptn.



P.M.	Wd. this preclude Israel’s coming into M.E. Def Pact?  Or even into  Br. Commonwealth?  



A.E. 	No.



P.M.	James de Rothschild has told me tht. Israel is likely to abandon dreams of independence &amp; adhere instead to Br. Comm.  Ambassador in Ldn. has confirmed this.  Wd. be remarkable initiative from them : it shd. not be disregarded, when the time comes.



A.E.	Entry into M.E. Def. Pact wd. be their first step.

	Para. 6 summarises practical gains to us from proposed Treaty.



R.A.B.	Is it necessary to offer free arms?  Awkward precedent.  Pakistan pays us for them. 

	But, on ths propn. the more they pay for installations, the more we have to give in free arms.



Sw.	But the installn. credit will enable us to justify the free supply in reply to any grumble from Pakistan.



A.E.	And U.S. are ready to give free arms if we don’t.  This wd. be v. tiresome.



H.M.	And otherwise we shd. get nothing for installns. if we let our Treaty run out.  As at end of a bldg. lease.



H.M.	£7-8 millions wd. be a reasonable figure for installations.

	Free arms wd. be pump-primer.  We cd. then sell replacements &amp; spares – once they are committed to Br. types.



de L.	If U.S. get their arms in free, their technicians will get a foot in.



R.A.B.	Agree in principle, but hope Ty. will be kept in consultn. on details.

	Shd. you not also get settlement of old claims – as part of Treaty.



H.M.	Let me get main lines of Treaty settled first : then see if we cd. mop up old claims at end.  Don’t however hold up negotns. on main Treaty.



A.E.	£6 m. for installns. wdn’t exhaust their need for arms.  They wd. need much more &amp; wd. have to buy them.



Sw.	This will be popular with Doms. (save India).  Shd. like now to tell all save India what we now propose.  Will consult H.M.



A.E.      x/	Nuri wd. like senior Minister to go out for signature.  Persians like it &amp; will prob. join in later.

	Wd. like x/ to be considered.  Celebration of renewal of Anglo-Iraq friendship.  They wd. like L.P. to go.



H.M.	Shall try to get Iraq to buy fr. us on off-shore basis.  Our main need is to have our own radar.  More likely to get off-shore arrangement if we give something free.
