C. (55)15							 17th February,1955



		1.	Indian Communities in Colonies.



A.L.B.	No immediate decision sought, but Cab. shd. be aware of problem.  Due to gt. growth in size of Indian communities.  Fiji, Mauritius.

	Status &amp; role of Indian Commrs.  Pant’s successor is co-operating.  May have to remove the man in Trinidad.

	They rank above Trade Commrs. because of their (more general) title.  Cd. C.R.O. consider wtr other Doms. shd. call their Trade Commrs. by title Commr. tout court?



Sw.	There is a memo. on that point.

	There is good concordat with Govt./India tht. their Commrs. shd. not interfere in local politics.



               x/	No Indian objn. to limitn. of immigration.

	Para (e) of 16 is open to doubt : private repns. to India are better than public speeches.



A.L.B.	x/ is not so easy in Colonies with multi-racial govts.



Sal.	Para 10 is most formidable.  Despite x/ there is constant propaganda to preserve link with India – &amp; also anti-colonialist attitude.  We shd. bear our respons. for these : territories &amp; do what we can to stop Indian immigration.



P.M.	Keep this in mind &amp; bring memo. up again.

	This is not moment for action.  Nehru is changing : attacked by Pravda : may be “light of Asia” : he is being helpful.

	Indian communities – difft. role in difft. Colonies : not necessarily always unhelpful.  They don’t quarrel with whites – rather with blacks : cf. Durban.  May be a balancing element in some places.



K.	Agree on timing.  But remember i) Indians may inherit Br. Empire by sheer power of fertility  ii) Watch progress of inter-racial integration in various Colonies.



Sal.	Don’t believe Indian Govt. will be on our side. His anti-colonial, anti-imperial, views are dominant in his outlook.  Don’t wait too long before we act.

							[Enter B.H., Att.G.



		

2.	Sugar Bill.



H.C.	Shd. we go on with this difficult Bill?



H.A.	Balance of argument seems in favour of trying to put it thro’.



H.G.	Endorse para. 3 of H.A.’s memo.



P.M.	Must we butt into this extensive hedgehog – at a time when Opposn. will be in pre-election mood.



H.C.	Don’t want compulsory time-table.  Doubt if this cd. be passed w’out one.  We shdn’t introduce but not pass because of its political flavour.  



H.A.	I agree with that.



R.A.B.	Can’t restore free market w’out this legn.



P.M.	Cd. terminal market be re-opened on token basis.



R.A.B.	Not w’out abandoning State-trading.

	If we abandon this legn. we i) go on with State trading, at a loss.

				        ii) lose earnings of a free market.

	We are losing £½ M. a month by not implementg. Cab. decn. to raise price.



H.M.	Criticism will be tht. Bill only transfers sugar from public to private monopoly.  Not easy.



H.C.	I wd. sooner put it thro’ at outset of new Parlt.  But be ready for that.



H.A.	Sole ground for not going on now is lack of Parly. time.



H.C.	That is my ground.



		Agreed : not in this Parliament.





		3.	Rating &amp; Valuation Bill.



H.C.	Can we do this?



D.S.	Cab. agreed to put it in Cat. A. for this session.

	Revenue are doing valuation on national basis.  If no action taken new assessmts. will issue in Oct. – tho’ they won’t know until ’56 that poundage is going down.  Thus all will think in Oct. they will have to pay much more.

	Bill will ease posn. on gas, churches, charities etc.,  But its main provn. secures p’ponement of new assessments, until December/January.

	Alternative to legn. is to p’pone introdn. of new valuations for another year by Order.  Motive (electoral) for that cd. not be concealed.



H.M.	Can’t stay as we are.  We must either have Bill or Order.  Bill is not limited to this : contains other &amp; useful provns. which are known to be necessary.



	Order : last p’ponemt. was not challenged.  If it were done again, it wd. be much more difficult to defend.  You cd. only argue tht. Parly. time had not bn. available for the Bill, which is necessary to clear up gas etc.,



D.S.	H.M. said in March ’54 tht. p’ponement was necessary in order to pass m’while the legn. necessary.  “Not enough time for that legn. this session.”  Can I say that again?



R.A.B.	Legn. will be necessary.  P’poned since 1952 : based on Act of 48 and valuations relate to ’34.  Their basis of valuation may soon be challenged in courts.

	Disparity between towns on equalisation grant is becomg. an open scandal – because not based on national valuation.



D.S.	P.Q. for early answer, askg date – by Hawton of Bd./Inland Rev.

		Resume discussion on Tuesday.





		4.	Coloured Immigrants.			[Enter H.W., Home.



Sw.	We shd. have to check this summary with all Doms – and many Colonies.  It wd. take some weeks to do this.



A.L.B.	Gives misleading picture because so much depends on way in which Regs are administered. 

	Let us get it checked.

	Then we can decide on policy when Bill is before us.



P.T.	Cd. Govts. also be asked how they administer these provns.



P.M.   x/	You will prob. have to confine this to law as it stands.



		Agreed :Revise on a/c of x/. and		[Enter A.E.

			  check with Govts.			[Enter B.C.

								[Exit H.W.





		5.	Public Transport : Special Travel Facilities.



B.C.	As in memo.

	Opinion among our supporters is divided.



Att.G.	Effect of recent decision.



A.E.	Para. 3.



B.C.	Immedte. problem arises fr. fact tht. 14 boros. have bn. doing it, and if you do nothing we shall have odium of its w’drawal.



A.L.B.	Opportunity for pol. bribery : unfair to private enterprise competitors.



D.S.	Tho’ it is bad practice, it’s awkward to be taking the butter out of dog’s mouth.



B.C.	Free travel is post-war.

	We cd. say – no national decn. leave it to private Bills by boros who want it.



A.L.B.	We have said, qua Tories, tht. this sort of thing shd. be dealt with on national basis.



B.H.	Can’t talk this out.  And on a vote, many of our members wd. vote for it.



K.	Gave in legn. Cttee. 5 good reasons v. Bill.  But 2, over-riding the other way.  i) It is in opn. : mean to w’draw it.  ii) We have advocated local issues being decided locally.  If B’ham think it reasonable, diff. for us to say they can’t do it.



O.P.	This is silly proposal but we wd. be unwise to oppose it.

	Varying provn. already by l.a.’s for o.a.p.’s.

	Talk it out if we can : but don’t make a stand v. it.



K.	Para. 9 shd. be accepted – as Cttee. point.



D.S.	Not so sure about this.  Wd. soon lead to demand for subsidised fares when no municipal transport.



Sal.	Leave it to local option.  Don’t add clause re private cos.



P.T.	That is argument for leaving whole thing to be governed by private Bill.



Att.G.	And that wd. be the better course – all round.



H.C.	But then each will be opposed &amp; we shall have constant argument on this ques.



R.A.B.	Cd. we restrict our support to existing cases – and say that new boros. must seek powers by Private Bill.  Then we can say that it’s bad in principle, as it is.



		Agreed :	Amend on these lines in Cttee.



							[Exit Att.G., B.C., B.H.

[Enter PMG.  Gammans.





		

6.	Foreign Affairs.				



A.E.	Formosa.	Dulles’ speech was better than feared.



	Italian Visit.  	Good communiqué, with firm reference to Paris agreemts.



	U.N. Assembly.	Always mistake to meet in U.S. in Election Year.  Sec. Genl. has said he wd. like to meet in Ldn.  But no accommn.  If therefore we want it, we shall have to lay money out for tempy. accommn. – tho’ we might make a profit, as French did.



P.M.	A great honour &amp; advantage to U.K.  Surely we shd. seize the opportunity.



D.S.	Wd.  pay us to have permanent Conference accommn.



A.E.	Then I will consider ways &amp; means, with some Ministers.





		7.	Television : Sunday Hours.



PMG.	Can we have television betwn 3-4 p.m. on Sundays, despite objn. likely to be raised by Sunday schools etc.,

	Adults like it.  No ban on sound b’castg in those hours.  And cos. will put on p’mmes unpopular with children.



H.C.	Wd. cause trouble.



PMG.	Wd. extend to B.B.C. also – who want it.



Sal.	Hard to deny it to adults.

	Suggest we agree with this in principle, but be ready to re-consider if, Churches do raise v. strong objns.



K.	With limitn. of p’mmes we cd. stand this.  			Agreed.
