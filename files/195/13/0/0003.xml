C.81(54)							2nd December, 1954



		1.	Foreign Affairs.			[Enter B.H and B-C.



		a)	China.



P.M.	High-handed attitude of Chinese over 13 U.S. airmen.  Hope we shall 

                x|	support view tht, in internatl. law U.S. are on sound ground.  



A.E. 	Propose to publish a/c of Ch. treatment of our p.o.w.  Print &amp; circulate to Cabinet before publn.



A.E.	Dulles has announced Formosa Treaty.  Reasonable receptn. by U.K. Press.  If world opinion is gteady, Oracle mght go fwd. in a week or so.  Wd. give a chance to reduce tension.



	Opposn. amendmt : seems to refer mainly to disarmament.  Whole initiative in fact was taken by us.  Suggest S.Ll. shd. reply, on basis of his knowledge, to N. Baker.  I will reply to debate, on wider basis seeking support for U.S. in F/East etc.,



		b)	Austria.



A.E.	Diffies. with M-France over Austria.  He is going to make his proposal to R. (longer-term occupn.).  It is dangerous.  Want agreed line betwn. us and U.S. – we are going to say we have both bn. informed of his intentn.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business – remainder of D/Address.  Govt. spokesmen on 2 concldg. days.



	Two days for 2nd. Rdg. of Pensions Bill: to meet Opposn. wishes.

	Suggested spokesmen, in addn. to M/P.  Fin. Secy.1st. day and Marples,2nd. day with I.McL. winding up on 2nd. Day.





		3.	Roads : Rural Roads in Wales.



D.A.	Cabt. appd. incln. in Legve. P’mme of Bill on rural roads in Wales.  Not mentioned in Speech.  Shall be asked to-day in debate on agric.

	Shall I say – yes : w’out commitment re extending Bill to England.



Ll.G.	I wd. volunteer it, w’out waitg. to be pressed.



Sal.	Yes – but don’t get committed to extending it to England.



	



	4.	Road Traffic : Parking Meters.			[Exit B.H.



J.B-C.	Essential part of plans to ease traffic congestion.



Sal.	Not happy.  Hardly touches fringe of problem.  Selective only.  In other places congestion will be as bad, or worse.  Where it is in force, payment will be exacted for any parking, however short.  All-day parkers are the problem : 60% of all in Ldn. : they might pay.



B-C.	After 4 hrs. it wd. be obstruction &amp; criminal offence.



Sal.	In U.S. this is money-making proposn. : not a remedy for congestion.

	Isn’t this the aim here, too – to raise money for garages?

	Underground garages in Ldn. squares, with removal of trees, is not welcomed by me.  The cloven hoof!  Suspicious of this.

	Let us know whole plan first.

            y|	Why not allow free parking for 2 hrs – and thereafter prosecute for obstruction.

	Why not use R. Parks for parking.



A.L.B.	Don’t accept this a/c of experience in U.S. &amp; Canada.  It has bn. useful.

	Money wd. be useful for constn. of garages – not necessarily underground.

	This will tend to keep cars moving.

	y/ is impracticable because of police man-power. He has to watch throughout the 2 hrs.



B.C.	This plan wd. reduce load on police: &amp; bring l.a.’s in.

	It is only experimental.  Can’t try it out w’out these powers.

	Garages.  Underground sites needn’t be used.  There are spaces which cd. be used if it were made to pay – as this wd. enable.



Ll.G.	Vital tht. experiment shd. be tried in Ldn.



D.E.	At M/W. resisted claims to increased parking in R. Parks.  Hyde Park or Mall shd. be preserved.

	Large scale experiment must be tried – or problem will merely be moved round.



H.C.	Considered &amp; recommended by Cttee. of Ministers.



A.L.B.	I said it wd. be included (power) in Bill.  We are committed.



B.C.	Want powers.  Ready to seek Cab. Authy. for any particular use of it.



R.A.B.	Put it in &amp; see how it goes in Parlt.  Cd. w’draw it.



Sal.	Don’t present it as main solution.



D.A.	Wrong to miss chance of getting power to try experiment.



A.E.	Don’t nail the meters to the mast in 2nd. Rdg.

	Experiment –	welcome views.

			Submit plans before action taken.

			This portion of speech to be submitted to P.M.





		5.	Commonwealth Membership.			[Exit B-C.



P.M.	Raises v. large issues.



Sw.	Considered by Committee.  Want to be able to discuss privately with old Dom. P.M.’s in January.



A.L.B.	Support this.  Want to talk to Austr. &amp; N.Z. P.M.’s.



A.E.	Must know where we stand before Jany.



		Adjourned – to special mtg. next week.  eg. Wedy.





		6.	Sudan : Compensation for Officials.



A.E.	Only 2 points now out-standing.



		i)	Amount.  Govr. Genl. has committed himself.  Thinks his 				personal honour is involved.  He may resign.  V. awkward.  But 			see need to avoid precedents.  Sudan is special case, qua 				Condominium.  Cd. we not make addl. sum available to G. 				Genl. for use in cases of hardship.



		ii)	Guarantee.  Only ques now is interim period.  Don’t think 			there will be diffy.  Cd. we say tht. if it does arise, we will [see 		them thro’ &amp;] go to Parlt. in order to get powers to see them 		thro’.



R.A.B.		Conduct of Howe is reprehensible.  Tel. of March : he told expatriates 		“ he stood on this offer”.  Before then he had Govt. views : since then 		he has considered smaller figure.

		Repercussions in Colonial Empire.

	But I see A.E.’s diffy. if Howe resigns.

	It is not money : it is precedent.  Proper way to avoid repercussions is to have legn. marking it out as a special case.



A.L.B.	Support that – or course of saying at once it is to honour pledge.

	Guarantee – v. awkward.  G. Coast &amp; Nigeria are in interim period.



R.A.B.	Art. 88 of Statute gives G. Genl. power to intervene.  I believe we cd. rely on that for second point.



A.E.	Wanted to give assurance tht. in case of need powers wd. be sought.



R.A.B.	That wd. give local Govt. the hint tht. we wd. act if they defaulted. 



A.E.	Don’t want to say it publicly.  Suggest only tht. G. Genl. shd. say it to Expatriates repves.

	“Unprecedented”.  But so is an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. 



A.L.B.	People in G. Coast &amp; Nigeria will ask for same assurances – and they aren’t far from Sudan.

	Content if we can do the same to Colonial servants.

	How will the supplementary sum be represented?



R.A.B.	Can’t we use Art. 88 for second point.  And Howe can add that he has verified with HMG. that his use of those powers wd. be approved.

	Will consider wtr suppl. sums cd. also be brght under Art. 88.



Agreed:	R.A.B. to work out formula on this basis &amp; discuss with A.E. &amp; ALB. concln. to be reported to Cabinet.





		7.	N.A.T.O. Authority to SACEUR.



A.E.	Had hoped N.A. Council cd. authorise plans for use of nuclear weapons &amp; alternative plans not involvg. their use.  U.S. &amp; Can. both say that is impracticable.

	Therefore the Gaitskell argument is released. – &amp; the nerves of the smaller N.A.T.O. countries will be ravaged.



P.M.	Use of nuclear weapons is only available protn. to those smaller powers.

	We ought not to declare our preference for fighting only	  [Exit O.P.

	with the weapons which will ensure our defeat.



A.E.	Agree tht. threat of immediate use of n. weapons is best deterrent.

	But is European opinion ready, w’in 2 wks., to face fact tht. there will never be a war in Europe w’out nuclear weapons.



H.M.	In practice there is no problem.  On R. aggression U.S. cd. release Strat. Air attack w’out consultn. with us : T.A.F. under Saceur wd. go ahead etc.,

	Problem is the political one.  If we admit tht. Forces have bn. or are being so transformed tht. they can operate only with a. weapons – then the political decn. wtr to use these weapons has bn. pre-judged.

	Public opinion has h’to isolated the H. bomb.  We now see that this isn’t practicable. Public haven’t yet bn. accustomed to it.

	Must therefore put (in NATO) main emphasis on political control.  Then we cd. get across idea tht. minor infractions e.g. in Berlin need not precipitate major (incldg. atomic) operations.



A.E.	H.M.’s final words are disingenuous because Govts. won’t have discretion in event re use of atomic weapons.



Sal.	Assume prior R. attack.  Duty of NATO commander to retaliate at once.  Cd. therefore concede to U.S.  “Except in case of prior nuclear attack, political decn. will be required ….”



H.M.	Perhaps best to raise Alerts, as well as planning, &amp; seek our safeguards under first rather than second.
