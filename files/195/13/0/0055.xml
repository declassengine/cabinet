C.M.13(55)							13th June, 1955

	

		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.

[Enter Ll.G., B.C., Ch.H., Att.G. Watk., B.H.



P.M.	No progress.  Some concession by B.T.C.  None by Aslef.

	Desired that no Parly. debate shd. be held to-day on merits of strike, while discns. proceed.  Tho’ if Oppn. started discn. on merits, we shd. have to reply



B.H.	Oppn. suggest statement by M/L. at end of Ques ending with appeal for no debate on merits.  Then ask for resolns. approving Regns. after discn.  Then proceed to Debate/Address.  Sal. Will do ditto in H/L., repeatg. M/L. statement.



H.A.	I was asked to consider wtr Agric. shd. be volunteered as a special subject.  Don’t want it.  We had debate in last days of old Parlt.  We cd. say nothg. new.  We shd. not get good support fr. our supporters.



P.M.	Shd. there not be some Ministerial speaker?



O.P.	Tuesday – Oppn. will raise Social Services.  I and M/H. will be ready to reply.



P.M.	I had wanted a Ministerial speech in order to prevent initiative going wholly to Opposn.



	Prs. Ll.G. shd. make somethg. of Em. Regns.



G.Ll.	Prs. cd. do 15 minutes on nuclear power.



P.M.	B/T. did v. well on Fri.  Shd. have liked somethg. similar to-day.



		Agreed :  G.Ll. to be ready to speak around 7 p.m. on nuclear 	power.



P.M.	T.U.C. haven’t done v. well.  They have failed to handle docks situation.  And by their encouragemt. to Aslef, they have prolonged rlway strike.



H.W.	They have bn. stupid, esp. in last few days.  Prs. Party politics have intervened.  But it wd. be unwise to quarrel with T.U.C. now.

								[Enter W.M.



W.M.	B.T.C. offer over week-end suggested basis for subsequent settlement.  No figures.  But w’drawal of earlier proposals not liked &amp; offer to consider basic rates of some drivers &amp; mileage allowances of firemen.

	Aslef are now saying we can’t call off strike w’out some assurance on figures &amp; some [: further] promise for firemen.

	I mght ask T.U.C. to press Aslef to accept this as reasonable basis for renewing negotns.

	I told Robertson y’day tht. Govt. sought to put no pressure on him but left him to do what he thought right for the B.T.C.  That being so, I’m sure he won’t offer any cash suggn. at present.

	Shd. B.T.C. be pressed to offer more?



			No suggn. fr. any Ministers that he should.



R.A.B.	Effect of these strikes (esp. docks) on economy is not yet appreciated.

	I shall have to make on Thurs. a v. serious speech – indicatg. tht. we can’t expect to compete with foreign countries if this sort of thing goes on.



W.M.	Oppn. &amp; T.U.C. are convinced of Aslef’s case.

	They will argue tht. in official strike there is no harm in negotiatg. while there is a strike.  It’s clear tht. Govt. have not urged employers to do it if they don’t wish to.  And B.T.C. don’t wish to.



P.M.	This is a v. serious point.

	It was my impn. tht. T.U.C. were encouraging Batey.  This confirms it.

	Surely Govt. can say, in strike holdg. up natl. economy, tht. strikers have no right to go on staying out until every detail of rates is settled.



S.Ll.	Is Robertson going to give token payment?  If he is, better to do it now.



B.C.	He made an offer before strike.  His new offer, difft. in form, involves no more cash.



Sal.	If (à la Rab) we are to paint picture as black as it shd. be., we shall be expected to act.  Are we ready to act?  If Rab – spks as foreshadowed, we can’t hold posn. until end/week.



W.M.	Token offer (even 6d.) wd. settle it.



H.A.	Wd. NUR consequentials of that be significant?



W.M.	Diffy. : 6d. wd. go to firemen : &amp; then to 14 or 15 grades in N.U.R.



W.	Both sides wd. like to escape fr. deadlock.

	Cd. B.T.C. say there is a case, they are ready to negotiate, there is a sum of money to give, but men must go back before they discuss how that sum is to be divided – Aslef &amp; N.U.R.



B.C.	R. wdn’t want to do it.  If it looks as tho’ B. has beaten R. it isn’t good.  If it doesn’t look like that, it won’t save Aslef face.



H.M.	Equivocal posn. because of natn.

	Strike costs B.T.C. £1 M. p day.  Old rlway mngr. wd. pay now somethg (6d.) he knows he will have to pay in a few days’ time.  On commercial grds alone he wd. want to end strike.



W.M.	Believe it cd. be settled now for 2/6 drivers : 6d. firemen; costing not substantially more than original offer.



P.M.	To offer it wd. “lose” strike.



H.M.	Wdn’t “lose” if same thing were expd. in global terms.



W.M.	Sum wd. have to cover both Unions &amp; they still won’t meet together.



R.A.B.	Attracted by idea tht. R. shd. offer to accept view of some independent person on amount of increase to drivers.



A.L.B.	Cd. James Milne be apptd. to divide up the total of original offer?



P.M.	Do we want employers’ side to make another concession.



Sal.	Shd. P.M. not see both sides now before they break off “negotns.”  His personal posn. will be involved.



J.S.	Awkward for P.M. if his intervention achieves nothing.

	

O.P.	Wrong to “fight to finish”.  Must end by compromise on both sides.  But later we shd. consider i) wtr Natd. Bds. shd. be repd. by ex T.U. man on labour relns.  ii) wtr men in natd. industries shd. be free to strike w’out prejudicing their pension rights.



H.	Play this one long.  But, as soon as it ends, show tht. Govt. mean to do somethg. (even if only an enquiry) on the general ques.



P.M.	Hope B.T.C. and Aslef will meet again at 4.30 p.m.

	Cab can decide Tues. am., wtr (if that mtg. results in nothing) I shd. summon both sides to see me.



	Liner Strike.



Sal.	Repns. fr. a director of Cunard.  Comm. inspired.  Activities of Stacey, going fr. port to port.  Much [victimisation] intimidation.

	He believes Q.E. will be last Cunard to sail.



B.C.	Sh. Fedn. are advised tht. no charge cd. lie v. Stacey for incitement.

	Some drift back.  Two liners sailed y’day.

	Fedn. are more keen to prosecute than Cunard.



Att.G.	There cd. be procdgs under M. Shipping Act for breach of articles.  That wd. be for Co.



B.C.	Hundreds are guilty of that.  How select?  Unwise to have mass procdgs.



Sal.	I wd. sooner see procdgs for intimidation – wh. Police cd. properly do.
