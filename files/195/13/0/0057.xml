A.L.B.	Enormous report : discussg. with Govrs., who want 6 mos. to formulate recommns.  We can’t delay debate as long as that : but it wd. be premature to debate it for a month.  Prs. I cd. on Tues. say something deprecatg. early discn.



R.A.B.	In spkg. in D/Address I shall have to be severe about consequences on our economy of successive demands for wage increases w’out corresp. increase in productivity.  B/payment prospects are not v. promising.

							[Enter Att.G.



		3.	Monopolies.



P.T.	Much public interest, as evidenced by P.Q.’s.

	Our declared policy : to deal with abuses.  But what is abuse?

	First step – statement as in C.P.41.  This includes promise to refer level tendering and common prices to Commn.  This is right.  Chairman agrees.  Para. 5 includes tea : good to have somethg. of v. direct interest to consumer.

	Course :	complete these general references, of wh. x/ is second.

			speed up appln., with help of some industrialists.

	Can’t be tough except thro’ machinery we establd. &amp; defended.



Ll.G.	Why tea?



P.T.	Because 5 leading firms, covering. 45% of supply [90% of blending &amp; distn.], run a common price.

	We have bn. criticised for not referring a good case.



H.A.	Believe they will be cleared : that wd. do good.  Am content with reference proposed.



R.A.B.	Chemical fertilisers.  Thght this was to be omitted.



P.T.	That was before accptn. because thght subsidy was to be raised.

	Prices are now going up.  Subsidy havg. risen.

	Enquiry has bn. asked for.



H.A.	2 firms only.  Efficient.  Want them to expand.  But some farmers suspect they make too much.



D.E.	Can you refer one product only of I.C.I.  How will you take a/c of fact tht. they need big profits on some to carry research into others.  This is sort of firm wh. increases our standards/living.



P.M.	That sort of objn. goes to root of policy &amp; Act : if it’s reason for having no enquiry.  These are arguments to be considered by Commn.



P.T.	Better to refer before prices go up, than in response to criticism tht. they have pinched major part of subsidy.



H.A.	Hope B/T. will warn I.C.I. &amp; Fisons, before announcemt. is made.



Sal.	Useful if early clarification of policy cd. be made.  Cd. then prs. be a debate in H/C.



P.T.	It is a fertile field for misrepresentn.



Sal.          y/	Cd. some economist make statement on B.B.C.?

							[Exit G.Ll., B.H., Att.G.

							[Enter de L. 

		

4.	Gatwick Airport.



B.C.	As in memo.



de L.	   ..    ..    ..     This is a v. diff. problem because of site.  Special reasons for undivided responsibility fr. beginning to end.  Either we do it, or M/T. take it on thro’ contractors.



P.M.	Put compromise suggd. in brief.



B.C.	I want a check at stage of preparation of contracts : before it’s decided how to invite tenders.



de L.	Technical ques : not for Ministers.



B.C.	Lay-out of civil airports is deviating from that of military.



D.E.	Support M/T.  We haven’t same level of ability in Govt. Works Dpts., because of level of pay.



RAB.	Give responsibility to Air Miny.  But get advice fr. private consultants before action taken.



de L.	I cdn’t accept that reflection on my experts.



S.Ll.	Duplication of effort as well as implied criticism.

	Surely we shd. have one system or the other.



P.M.	Heathrow?



de L.	Air Miny. Works had overall responsibility.



B.C.	But they employed Halcrow.



de L.	On bldgs, not runways or lay-out.



B.C.	M/T. is ultimately responsible for this.



A.L.B.	I wd. rely on consultants alone.  Air Miny. have always bn. v. Gatwick.



de L.	I wd. prefer tht.



R.A.B.	Regret that, for we have efficient Dpt. – why not use it.  But prudent, as it may be failure, for Govt. to be able to say tht. advice of private consultants was taken.



		Agreed : Proceed as at (b).
