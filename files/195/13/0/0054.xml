C.M.12(55)							7th June, 1955.



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B-H., H-B.



H.C.	Business in H/C. in opening days.

	Debate on Address : hope to finish on Thursday of next week.  On the Friday 2nd. Rdg. of a Govt. Bill.

	Mover : W. Middlesboro’.  Seconder. Harrison. Malden.



P.M.	Tell Labour Party we think strike situation shd. be discussed this week.





		2.	Four-Power Meeting.



H.M.	We have suggested Geneva from 18-21 July.  Note to Soviet Govt. has bn. delivered.



							[Enter B-C., G.Ll.



		3.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	T.U.C. suggns. don’t help : may make situation more difficult.

	Negotns. between parties while strike is on is quite unacceptable &amp; v. 

x|	bad precedent.  Only method is to see parties individually at M/L. to see wtr there is a basis for negotns.  B.T.C. wd. discuss charges of bad faith.

	Propose to send for T.U.C. – explain diffies. of their proposals – regret they didn’t tell me first – press x/.

	Before debate in H/C. think I must also see Aslef – merely for purpose of taking stock.  Prs. Wed. or Thurs.

	May be tht. neither Union will accept T.U.C. plan.



L.P.	Suppose they do.  We shall be embarrassed in rejecting it.

	Public won’t understand why there can be no negotn. while strike continues.



P.M.	There can be discns. before strike is called off : but no formal negotns.  We must stand firm on that.  Weakens posn. of employer hopelessly.

i)  Shd. be guidance on this from M/L. to Press to-day.  Can be by reference to my b’cast on Sunday, when I made this distinction clear.

ii) 	More difficult to know wtr guidance shd. be given on T.U.C. proposals pointing out diffies. of them. 		      Agreed



Agreed.: guidance on this too.



K.	May we not have to come to point of offering Ct. of Enquiry on differential.  We believe in differential.  Don’t want to leave that to Unions only.

L.P.	Shd. be brght out tht. B.T.C. have offered a sharp differential.  Public don’t realise tht. Union object to differentiation among drivers.



P.M.	Congratns. on success of arrangemts to m’tain essential services.



Ll.G.	Unco-operative attitude of B.B.C. re news of liner strikes.



B.C.	Hasn’t helped with threatened strike of crew of Q.E.



		Agreed :	Ll.G. to see Jacob.



Ll.G.	Have seen Stewards of Jockey Club.  They have agreed to cancel Sandown mtg and to p’pone Royal Ascot.  They will announce this.  Queen has agreed qua Ascot.



								[Enter Att.G.

		4.	Parliament : Emergencies during Dissolution.



Ll.G.	May be pressure to amend law to enable assembly of Parlt. to be moved forward.  If so, the other points may be raised.

	Cd. a Cab. Cttee. consider these points.



P.M.	Need we cover all contingencies?

	Cd. we not brush these ques away if asked.

	As regards emergencies, there is a Govt. even when no Parlt.



K.	Cd. promise, if needed, to look at it – there is no hurry.  Don’t prmise legn.



P.M.	No Cttee. until we see how debate in Parlt. goes.





		5.	Industrial Relations.



W.M.	Shall have opportunity to-day to get views of B.E.C. on these points.  There is also possibility of a statutory delay, before strike called – as under Order 1305.



L.P.	Unhappy at atmosphere.  May be like crumbling of democracy, as in Italy.  cf. liner stewards : high wages, no responsibility.  This, they used to say, is effect of unrestricted democracy.  Has led elsewhere to Fascism because of irritn. of middle-classes. 

	Govt. must not seem weak over this.  Tho’ we mustn’t antagonise workers, there are other classes whose irritn. is rising.



W.M.	Full emplt. has distorted relative power of parties in collective bargaining.



D.S.	Doubt if we shall find a better opp. than this of tackling this.



H.A.	This is moment (this Parlt.) for action.  Have consultns. certainly but we shall need to act.



A.L.B.	Trade Unionists themselves are worried about this.



H.C.	Can we have apprecn. of growth of Commn. in U.K. &amp; its part in encouragemt. of strikes?



H.B.	Need for educn. of whole public – on economics of full emplt.  We shd. continue our efforts on “Wh. Paper” (R.Hall).



H.	Favour R. Commn. or Cttee. – for purpose of educatg. public.



D.S.	But don’t miss the moment for action.  Time is nearly ripe.

		i)   Cd. Union funds be attached on clear breach of agreemt.

		ii)  Cd. Unions expel men who joined unofficial strikes.



A.E.     x|/	Fin. Times article to-day on workers’ share in industry : Ty. &amp; B/T. 

	  |	shd. consider, &amp; report.  Labour Party are likely to pinch our ideas.



D.E.		Wd. wish to discuss para. 10 with W.M.

	Ministers of Edn. have discouraged courses in economics, T.U. history etc., for fear of helping Socialism.  Not sure this was right.



H.M.	Discipline in industry used to be fear of unemplt.  Who knows what to put in its place?  The most important ques of our time.



P.M.	I will appoint a small Cttee. to go more deeply into this.

H.M.	Only part of this is suitable for enquiry : part (e.g. co-partnership) is high political thinking.



							[Exit G.Ll., B.C.



		6.	Kenya.



A.L.B.	Need for a shock to bring an end to this – land is best means.

	Tel. 629.  Arguments for disqualificn. in addn. to forfeiture.  Cab. shd. know views on this of Govt. of Kenya.  But I recognise objns. to that proposal.

	Believe we can get compromise, however, by dropping disqualificn. plan &amp; extendg. provn. for forfeiture.  I have at present limited use of forfeiture to leaders, &amp; 50 only, &amp; to specified land.  We cd. make it applicable more widely &amp; relieve need to specify land.  But individuals wd. need to be named in schedule to Order.

	This will go some way.  Don’t believe we can go further.  Won’t cover landless youth or women.  

Anything less than that wd. be likely to cause resignns. fr. Kenya Govt.

	No appeal procedure for forfeiture.  Remedy wd. be approach to Adminn.



P.M.	Prefer amended version of para. 5 of draft statement.



							[Exit A.L.B.



		7.	Monopolies.



P.T.	As in memo.



D.S.	In reports of Commn., tendency to make vague recommns. e.g. tht. a practice may continue if prices remain reasonable.  This puts on Govt. an oblign. to m’tain price control, wh. we don’t want to do, or a vague responsibility for supervising prices.



H.B.	Memo. is in line with R.A.B.’s views.



D.E.	Cement.  Produce more cheaply than any in world.  Wd. be inefficient w’out cartel.  A model industry.  Why put them to all the trouble of enquiry.  At least we shd. avoid appearance of putting them in dock.



S.Ll.	Many of these industries are not run by people who can easily defend themselves in such an enquiry.  Why divert their attention e.g. fr. export trade.



P.T.	On other hand, don’t want to condemn an industry before we refer to Commn.



D.S.	Shd. there not be prima facie case of a ring operating to disadvantage of public interest.



P.T.	That is not in statute.



W.	There must be an element of accusation.  Best men shd. not be distracted by this sort of thing.



K.	No.  We stand for private enterprise &amp; competition.

	The accusatory method of U.S. was deliberately rejected by Coalition Govt., in favour of enquiry.



L.P.	We are against abuse of monopoly, not v. monopoly as such?



P.T.	Examn. is needed before one can be sure where national interest lies.



H.A.	There is public anxiety about near-monopoly as such.  We need to establish wtr public interest is suffering.



H.M.	Avoid commitment in D/Address.  Let us have time to consider.  Not at all sure philosophy on this is sound.



		Resume discussion next week – before full answer has to be 

given in D/Address.

							[Exit Att.G.



		8.	Ministry of Housing &amp; Local Govt.



D.S.	Cumbrous.  Has to be abbreviated – and “Local Govt.” falls out.



P.M.	Will be said, if Housing” is omitted, tht. we don’t mean to build any more.



H.M.	Leave it alone.  Bad politics to change it now.





		9.	Departmental Records.



		Memo approved.
