C.87(54)							15th December 1954



		1.	Parliament.		[Enter BH., S.Ll., B-C., H. Brooke, G.Ll.



P.M.	Liberals are pressing us to agree to enquiry into voting system.  Hope Cab. will be ready to consider after Xmas.

	Am opposed to P.R.  But hope we will keep open minds on enquiry.

	I may have to receive deputn.





		2.	Parliamentary Constituencies.



B.H.	Opposn. will vote v. “take note” to-day.  To-morrow there will be no Opposn. Whips on – individuals will be free.

	When our people are displaced. shd. we continue to keep Whips on?  Don’t want people voting against; those who dissent shd. abstain.



H.C.	We must adhere to that plan – as consistent with commending plan as a whole.



Ll.G.	Change of names of constituencies is also being raised.  We must stand firm on that – otherwise Orders wd. need to be reprinted &amp; we cdn’t get them before Xmas.



H.C.	Offer to look into it – as somethg. separate.

								[Exit B.H.



		3.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	Reported result of discn. with B. Robertson.

	Outlined form of statement wh. might be made.

	If this provoked strike notices, we cd still do something.  I cd. summon the parties : if thght proper, I cd. point out tht. more cd. be considered (e.g. efficiency &amp; future of rlways) &amp; set up Ct. of Enquiry.  They wd. be in a worse posn. then if they didn’t w’draw strike notices.

	Disposed to take this firm line, despite risks (e.g. coal shortage).

	B.R. thinks tht., if lower grades went up, tribunal wd. award more to footplate-men to m’tain differential.



B.C.	In broad agreement.  But believe they will retort by issuing strike notices.

	This mght be evaded if we brought up concludg. sentence &amp; insert it as offering consultns. if B.T.C. reached agreement they cdn’t afford.



				Adjourned.

							[Enter Maudling., J.T.



 

		4.	East/West Trade.



P.T.	Doubt if U.S. will accept package even as proposed by me.  No chance if I extend it as M/T. proposes – tho’ I agree with him on trade grounds.



B.C.	The ones we want to sell are 8-14 yrs. old, built during the war.  This plan wdn’t help much on that.  Mine wd. meet substance of shipping’s needs.



P.M.	Cd. we not begin with M/T. line : then go over to B/T.



P.T.	Advised that U.S. wdn’t look at it.  Wdn’t regard it as compromise.



A.E.	My advice is : just a chance tht. P.T. plan might go thro’.

	With M/T. plan inserted, package isn’t worth putting.  It wd. be better not to seek comprehensive deal at all.



P.T.	If package fails, we wd. put our full case on ships separately.

	Shd. Maudling put it personally to Stassen, when he sees him in Paris.

	Send telegram as drafted.  Let Maudling explain.  He can say Cab. wd. have liked much more … on ships.



Sw.	Para. 3(ii).  Can we omit “first instance”?



P.T.	Will re-consider wording.  Intentn. was to make it clear that we aren’t committed.



A.E.	Special type of copper wire wh. I must consider privately with H.M., P.T.

						           [Enter de. L., A.H., C.O.S.





		5.	Warships for Israel.



J.T.	As in memo.



A.E. 	[Unheard.]



P.M.	Safest way for Israel &amp; E. to spend their money.  Our naval strength in Med. won’t be affected.





		6.	Training of German Airmen by R.A.F.



de L.	As in memo.



A.E.	Defensible once G. are in N.A.T.O.  Await ratification.



Sw.	Might be less unpopular here if Canada did some of it.  They are training nearly all N.A.T.O. countries.



de L.	We shd. like to do most – because Can. disposn. twds U.S. methods.

	400 refreshers for ex Luftwaffe pilots &amp; 500 new entrants.



Sal.	No enthusiasm for this.  Won’t be welcomed.



H.M.	Arms race is on.  Everyone is trying to sell equipmt. to G.  Don’t want U.K. to be left with all training &amp; no sales.  Must get our foot in on equipment to offset our new cost of m’taining. B. forces in Europe.

	Private firms are already awake to this.  G. naval mission is coming here.  We are in touch with Speidel.

	We must take risk of early private talks – before ratification.

	Esp. as U.S. will offer them so much free.  They have already sent a mission to Bonn for this purpose.



H.C.	Cd. we not train them in Germany.



de L.	To some extent : but wd. be much more costly.



P.T.	Shan’t get any orders unless we take a risk on training.



D.S.	G. wd. prefer Br. tanks but not in preference to free U.S. types.



H.M.	Might get some off-shore element.



A.E.	Consider what can be done in Germany.



de L.	Wd. prob. cost more.  Might have to consult Germans. Persuade them to pay for installation costs.



H.M.	Allow naval &amp; army contacts to continue – no emotion in that.  

Air – approve in principle : explore doing bulk in Germany.





		7.	British Prisoners in Korea.			[Exit C.O.S.

									[Enter Att.G.



P.M.	Proposed b’cast on tortures in impt. by Chinese, R. &amp; G.

	Why shd. this be put out now – to inspire hatred etc.,  Better forgotten.



A.H.	We only vetted it on security grounds.



Sw.	Surely B.B.C. shd., as policy, avoid stirring up malice etc.,



A.H.	I cd. discourage on security grounds.



H.M.	What of our proposed publication?



P.M.	Words are different from radio.



P.T.	B.B.C. will hardly think it logical tht. we shd. stop them &amp; publish this ourselves.



Att.G.	An ordinary publisher wdn’t risk publn. of Ch. VI and VII.

	What evce. cd. I call if libel action were started?



A.E.	Winnington &amp; Shapiro were refused Br. ppts.  They prob. fear to return.

	Mrs. Felton and G. might take action.  But Ch. VI was publd. in substance in Yorkshire Post.  I wd. risk prosecn.  Let them defend themselves in Ct., if they can.



Att.G.	Wdn’t look well if we lost the action.

	Labour Govt. considers prosecn., but decided there wasn’t a case.



A.E.	Can I satisfy Att.G., on the evidence?  



A.H.  	We have some.



Att.G.	Cd. we re-write to avoid implicn. of treachery.



K.	X-examn. wd. reduce chance of damage above 40/=.



H.C.	White Papers are usually objective – this isn’t.



A.E.	x/ 	Propose publn. by Stat. Office – don’t seek protection.



P.M.	Proceed as at x/.  But let Att.G. consider alterations to reduce risk of prosecutions.



A.E.	Can’t do that.  Must risk procdgs.



Sal.	Is Ch. VI a necessary Chapter?  In VII, names cd. be omitted.  Is it necessary to pillory the individuals.



H.C.	Mention names only in reln. to activities in China.



Att.G.	Believe minor alterations cd. reduce risk of procdgs.  Without damaging case v. Chinese.



A.E.	Don’t want to let off English Communists.  Allegns. v. them are taken verbatim fr. Yorkshire Post.



Att.G.	That is Ch. VI, not VII.



W.M.	Ignore the risk to save substance of story.

	Right of Att.G. to warn us of the risk.  But I wd. take it.



K.	So wd. I.



	Agreed.	Publish as S.O. publication &amp; accept the risk.



						[Exit AH., de L., J.T. Att.G.



		3.	Industrial Disputes : Rlways (cont’d).



	Draft announcement.



B.C.	More likely than not to provoke issue of strike notices.



W.	Even so, doesn’t follow there will be a strike.  Feeling is not generally strong.  Only in some areas.



H.B.	Is last para. necessary – or consistent with obligns.  Commms. first duty wd. be to consider possibility of increased charges.



P.M.	This para. is only hope of averting strike.

	Anyway it wd. be B.R.’s statement, not ours.  It makes it clear tht. he will not plead poverty before the tribunal.



B.C.	I wd. like it related to negotn. stage as well as arbitn. stage.



W.M.	B.R. wd. probably accept that.



B.C.	Put formula.



A.E.	That puts it v. wide.  



P.T. 	Will be read as implying Govt. will pay.



A.E.	Shd. rlway statement be main part of Govt. announcement?  Don’t we want to say more e.g. about modernn. etc.,



H.B.	Why not put B.T.C. statement out alone. Then RAB cd. consider draft of Govt. statement.



B.C.	There will have to be an early Govt. statement.



A.E.	Concerned at final para. of B.T.C. statement.  Don’t want that embodied in a Govt. statement.  Implies our assent.



W.M.	Suggest we draft a longer tail-piece.



		Agreed : final para. to be confined to result on arbitn.

		Revised draft to-morrow.
