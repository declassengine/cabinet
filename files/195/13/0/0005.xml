C.83(54)							7th December, 1954





		1.	Commonwealth Relations.



Sw.	Represents a years’ study.

	Concln. : no change in what has bn. assumed to be normal course of development.

	Started with bias in favour of a 2-tier system, but found this impracticable.

	Full membership is matter for decision by all.

	Independence is for U.K. – Colony can then choose to go out.

	We believe tht. Gold Coast wd. elect to go out if refused full membership.

	Even if 2 tier were instituted, risk of f. influence on 2nd. tier.

	There cd. still be discrimination in practice – as there is already, not solely on black/white basis.  Other Doms. practice this too.  Canada admitted that to me recently.  More regional or ad hoc mtgs will be needed.

	Para 2 (ii).  Right of access to Crown – not intended to apply to republics.



P.M.	Cd. be allowed if a republic desired it.



Sw.	Only so far as their constitution allowed.

	If G. Coast admitted to full membership, C Africa Fedn. will have to be admitted too.  That wd. merely regularise existing posn. : it wd. not involve alteration in constitn. of Fedn.  Huggins wants to discuss this in Jany.

	No ques. of Decision to-day on Gold Coast – only a general trend of policy.



P.M.	Merely a negative decn. against 2-tier system.



Sw.	Want private talks on policy with some P.M.’s in Jany.  No public announcement.  Have talked already to St. Laurent.  He agreed with this general line of policy.  We shd. now broach it with P.M.’s of Austr. &amp; N.Z.

	Final points	i) no transfer to C.R.O. save an attainment of full 			membership.

			ii) training Gold Coast officials in foreign affairs.



W.M.	Agree in general.

	Para 16. assumed Malan as P.M.  Suppose tht., by time Gold Coast decn. has to be taken, we shall know what S.A.’s genl. attitude twds Commonwealth will be.



A.E.	Difficult because will alter character of Empire.

	Not absolutely sure decision on India was right.

	Two-tier system is unworkable – formally : tho’ in practice we may develop somethg. like it.

	But, on balance, accept this general course.



Sal.	I also am concerned.  Hope first part of para. 4 is true.

	Close relations in war with Doms.  Contrast with situation as I found it later, when Asiatics were in.

	Policy of self-govt. for Colonies has gone too fast.  See no course now other than try formal equality with inequality in practice.

	Day may come when we have to choose betwn. S. Africa &amp; Gold Coast.  If so, am not sure I wd. choose Gold Coast.

	Crown, in my view, is the only link.  India was disastrous decision.



A.L.B.	Accept arguments against 2 tier system.  Go for equal status w’out equal functions.

	Dates.  G. Coast will qualify by end of ’56 or soon after.  We have to go to U.N. on Togoland before then, &amp; that may raise issue with S. Africa.

	C. Afr. Fedn. agree with proposal.  “W’in its constitn.”.  But it will contain still 2 Colonies : &amp; access to Crown in respect of them can’t be granted to P.M. of Fedn.

	Only other early candidates.

	Nigeria.  O.L. said last year tht. any Region desiring it cd. have full self-govt. in ’56.  This will be a diffy. while centre is still dependent.

	Malaya.  Not immediate.

	W. Indian Fedn.

	All these are v. loyal to Crown – and are not likely to go out of the “circle of the Crown”.



D.S.	What is nature of decn. on membership.  Wd. S. Afr. have a veto?



Sw.	If 7 out of 8 welcomed e.g. Gold Coast, the 8th. wd. have to decide wtr to accept that or go out.



P.M.	Melancholy prospect.  Must face facts.  But don’t try to define undefinable.  Not all members of Club, tho’ equal in status, have equal influence – or equal popularity.  Don’t rush ahead – tho’ we must think ahead.  Needn’t be committed at this stage.  There will be an election here before this issue arises in concrete form over Gold Coast.  Can’t know how any of us will feel about this when it arises – must depend on circs.

	W’in equality of all, there is the military test : what contribn. are you ready to make?  Defence discns. can always be limited to those who have undertaken commitments.  That is happening, and can be developed as a matter of practice.



Sal.	Can’t talk with other P.M.’s without some view.



H.M.	Is it not likely tht. crisis over S. Afr. will precede that over G. Coast?



Sw.	Not sure.  Havenga believed tht. only ⅓ rd. wd. vote for republic on plebiscite.  Doubt if S. will do it, save after election in which it was specific issue.



P.M.	Events make history.  They form our opinions.



K.	Accept arguments (§10-11) v. formal 2-tier system.

	Can we defer decns. points in  para. 11 of Sw. covering memo.  Don’t we accept 11(i)?  If so, can we avoid 11(iii)?  Must we not say tht. this is our general view.

	Welcome last sub-para. of para. 13.  Re-assuring.

	Training of G. Coast for its new position.  Hurry slowly : but we must be prepared &amp; see that they are prepared to accept their new responsibilities.

	Appeal to Judicial Cttee. – shd. be m’tained wherever it hasn’t bn. lost.

	We ought to consider this point.  Have always favoured a peripatetic Cttee.  Cd. we not pursue this, as a practical bond.



H.C.	See no alternative but to open up conversations with P.M.’s of older Doms.



D.S.	Merger of C.O. and C.R.O. wd. blur the differences v. satisfactorily.



A.L.B.	Contemplated in report on “smaller territories” – wh. I will circulate for informn.



Sal.	What of consultns. with Opposition on this?  Don’t want changes of policy acc. to Party in office.  As over Ireland in 19th. century.



P.M.	Wait for the Election.

		Accept para. 11 of covering memo. in principle.

		Make haste slowly.

		No formal consultns.  Informal talks with P.M.’s of A. &amp; N.Z.  	Wait &amp; see how Strydom develops.

		(Sw. Anyhow, he won’t come in January.)



P.M.	Prepare version of this memo. for old P.M. Doms.





		2.	S.E.A.C.D.O.



A.E.	U.S. are pressing for early mtg. of Ministers.  Dulles offers to defer for a month to ensure my personal attendance.  May clash with Comm. P.M.’s



P.M.	Must have A.E. at Comm. Mtg.
