C.M.4(55)							19th April, 1955



		1.	Election Business Committee.		[Enter B-H.



		N.B. to discuss with W.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	What legn. shd. be completed before Dissolution?  In addn. to Fin. Bill, a Nat. Insurance Bill and Navigable Waters Bill.  Shd. be poss. to get these thro’.  This is H/C.  H/L. will have heavier task : a no. of Bills shd. be passed there, incldg. Crofters &amp; Requisitioned Houses.  We can’t take any Lords Amendmts., except prs. on Pensions &amp; Oil.



H.	No legn. re Pakistan will be needed.



							[Enter B-C., G.Ll.

		



3.	Industrial Disputes.



		Newspapers.



W.M.	T.U.C. convened mtg. y’day.  Natsoper wasn’t repd.  Unions asked for mtg. with N.P.A.  Unions will suggest resumptn. of work on promise by NPA to negotiate.  	Outcome will turn on extent to which there is genl. desire to resume.  If no agreemt. reached, it will come back to me.



		Railways.



	If B.T.C. made any concession to this, N.U.R. wd. make further claims.  They hate ASLEF : they accepted Tribunal award.  But they have much smaller no. of footplate men : &amp;they wd. climb on any band wagon.

	B.T.C. have asked ASLEF to reconsider.  They cd. say their decn. was 

x|	taken before they knew there was to be an Election.  They mght therefore p’pone strike.

	In any statement, I wd. wish to say : no room for conciliation, &amp; I have not bn. asked to conciliate.  Cd. refer to x/ &amp; say : presume they don’t want to interfere with democratic process.  If called off, it wdn’t be resumed.



		Docks.



	Inter-Union rivalry.  Acute ques now is recognn. of Stevedores Union on Merseyside.  Employers wd. like to recognise.  Shall send for Deakin &amp; warn him tht. it wd. be wise to negotiate – or he will be in trouble.



		Railways (resumed)



B.C.	B.T.C. think NUR wdn’t join in, so long as no indicn. given tht. ASLEF will get any concession. 

	Strike by ASLEF only wd. mean patchy results – no effect in Ldn, 50% out in North, nearly 100% out in W. and S.W.  Wd. not be poss. to call for volunteers.



G.Ll.	Coal.  Effect less serious than in winter because no personal hardship.

	But loses 3m tons p.wk. and industry wd. suffer.  For one week no effect.  But by 14/5 power stations &amp; gas works wd. have to be kept going at expense of industry &amp; unemplt. wd. begin to emerge.



P.M.	No word of encouragemt. to strikers.  No change in our plans.  Must see it thro’ if it comes.



Ll.G.	Emergency Procln., if made : no H/C. to meet : mght. be poss. to act by Prerogative.

							[Exit G.Ll., B.C.





		4.	Cotton.



R.A.B.	Can find no alternative.  Intend therefore to leave Budget as planned.  If I can find anything better later, I can add it.

	Believe this will be better received than is thought.

	Can’t be a debate on Lancs. for 2 wks.  Will consider m’while what can be done, if anything;  and I will take that debate.

	Opposn. know v. well the reasons for 2 : 1 ratio betwn. cloth and garments.  They will think a 50% redn. is dangerous enough.

	Shd. I foreshadow a further statement on Lancs.?



P.T.	Will be read as promise of more.  Wd. sooner you left it to me when I speak later in Budget debate.



P.M.	If nothing said, will be assumed we intend to do no more.



H.	Wd. prefer to omit – mght be thght to imply quota discns. in India.



		Agreed – leave it to P.T., who will speak in Budget debate.



R.A.B.	P.T. shd. discuss with P.M. wtr he has enough to say on Lancs. to warrant his speaking to it.  If he hasn’t, mght be better for someone else to make that speech.

							[Exit R.A.B., B.H.





		5.	Austria.



H.M.	For whatever motive, R. are now willing to conclude Treaty.  We can say this is result of firmness.  	Betw. ourselves, we must recognise tht. it may be due to R. desire to tempt G. with similar bait on basis of mil. neutrality.

	Must insist on A.’s freedom to join any European organn. wh. is not military.  Swedish, rather than Swiss, model.





		6.	European Defence &amp; 4 Power Meeting.



H.M.	Workg. to mtg on 27/4 of officials to discuss terms of invitn. to R. &amp; policy.

	Ratifns. by 5/5.  May 7-10 – NATO Mtgs : to receive G. : to hold 3 &amp; then 4 Power talks of Ministers to settle invitn. &amp; date for 4 Power Mtg.



		C(55)83 approved.





		7.	Formosa.



H.M.	Thinking of 2 plans.	i) If sudden attack on coastal islands, we must have formula wh. we can use – preferably agreed with U.S.  This is necessary precaution for Election period.

				ii) If we have more time, another plan.  M. is cross with us : but Can. &amp; N.Z. will support us.  Not v. much in it.  Prs, presentn.  We can’t have “guarantee”.  U.S. don’t want it : they need only our moral support.  Will try therefore to work out a statement wh. U.K. cd. make : based partly on U.N. &amp; partly on possibility of negotn. thro’ 4 Power Mtg.  On ii) there wd. be time for me to talk to Dulles.



A.E.	On i) we can prob. take Canadian line (Jan.) in less harsh language.

	On ii) statement shd. be made before Parlt. dissolves.





		8.	Afro-Asian Conference : Accident to Indian Aircraft.



P.M.	Message fr. Nehru.



A.L.B.	Precautions were taken – but aimed at persons rather than aircraft.  But we shd. certainly have full enquiry.  I will consult M/T. on use of his experts.  But main enquiry will be by Indonesians since crash took place there.

	Enquiry in H Kong cd. be given more formal pattern.

	Will submit draft reply to P.M.







		9.	Cyprus.



A.L.B.	Since memo., disturbances in Cyprus.  Timing therefore needs thought as well as policy.  Tho’ may not be able to win again in U.N., if we have taken no forward action since last discn.

	This policy mght build up some vested interests in C.  But may not be enough to induce Greece to stop interfering.  And if we went further Turks mght oppose.

	Cd. we suggest discns. with Gks. &amp; Turks., as addl. step.

	Timing.  Mght seem weak after disturbances.  But they may be designed to prevent us fr. makg. an announcement.  Can we wait until June? – v. risky because of developmts. in C.

	We shd. have to take Turks into confidence : also, prs., tell Greece.

	Certainly we shd. try to enlist U.S. pressure on Greece.



H.M.	Will Cab. p’pone?  Statement to H/C now is of no importce. outside U.K.  Mght even stimulate Labour to offer more.  Statement by a new Govt. cd. be more impressive.

	Agree we shall have to do somethg. before U.N. meets again.



A.L.B.	Don’t challenge those arguments.  But remember risk of troubling blowing up in C. m’while.  Jamming Gk. b’casts?  Consider.
