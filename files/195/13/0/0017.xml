C.3(55)								13th January, 1955



							[Enter A.H., Att.G., N.Brooke

		1.	Kenya.



A.L.B.		Para 3 of Tel. 34 from Nairobi.  This is moment for imaginative move.

But must be balancing gesture twds loyalists threatened with procdgs.  Full support of War Council – incldg.  Att.G. and C-in-C.

		Hammer Opn. began 48 hrs. ago.  This is moment.



Sw.		Won’t extend to white officers in Police?



A.L.B.	Wd. cover one v. whom procdgs. are in train : &amp; others might not be charged who wd. otherwise have been.  Diff. to discriminate betwn. Eur. &amp; Africians.



P.M.	Pity to confuse this surrender offer with w’drawal of procdgs. v. loyalists.



A.L.B.	Cdn’t defend first w’out second.  Wd. lead to desertions fr. Home Guard &amp; wd. affront settlers.



Att.G.	By Bill of Rights suspension of procdgs is illegal.  Even tho’ Crown doesn’t proceed, it must be left open to private prosecutors.

	Announcemt. in advance, of pardon intention, is novel &amp; dangerous.



Sw.		Leave possibility of private prosecutn. – and take a chance on it?



A.L.B.		Govr. will make Em. Regn. suspending all prosecutions.



P.M.		Prefer to adjourn discussion of this to smaller mtg. Friday a.m.





PM.		Why was I not consulted on relief of Erskine.



A.H.	His apptmt. was for 2 years, agreed with C.O.  Consulted A.L.B., with whom I discussed his successor.  ALB saw Lathbury at my request.  We announced “May, or as soon as opn. circs. allowed.  Erskine pressed for early announcement.

	W.O. however disregarded standing order requiring notificn. of P.M. I take full responsibility for that omission.



A.E.	Apptmts. for term of years doesn’t seem congruous with conduct of active operations.



A.H.	Has bn. much thought of making a change.  Erskine &amp; Baring have not always seen eye to eye.  This was background.  We were not sorry to see time coming for a change of C-in-C.



H.M.	We shd. in future consult collectively an appointmts. involving international or political consns.



P.M.	They shd. not be made w’out reference to P.M. – who may wish to consult Cabinet.



			Adjournment – to 5. p.m.				[Exit A.H.





		2.	Afro – Asian Conference.



A.E.	P.M.’s of Colombo Powers have summoned this for end/Apl.  Deprecate it, but can’t stoop it.  What therefore shd. we say to our friends?

	x|	Unwin to encourage people to go who don’t want to.  But, for those

	  |	 who are ready to go, we shd. give all informn. &amp; help we can.



Sw.		Don’t like this in reln. to Nehru’s disposn. to interfere in Africa.

		Cdn’t we somehow exclude Africans?



A.L.B.		Agree : I wd. like to, if possible.

		Wd. it be impossible to advise them to stay away?



A.E.		And have it known tht. we made this attempt?



A.L.B.		Gold Coast P.M. cd. prs. be dissuaded.  He has promised to consult 		Govr.



Sw.	C. African Fedn. have suggd. no more than observer : he cd. be eased off doing that.



Agreed: Advise G. Coast &amp; C. Afr. Fedn. discreetly, not to go.

	F.O. as regards foreigners to proceed at x/.



									[Enter de L., G.Ll.

		3.	Muscat.



A.E.	Saudis, baffled at Buraimi, are nibbling here.  Valuable prospects.  Some of our exp’re may be recovered from I.P.Co.



H.B.		No Ty. objn.  Hope to recover all of it.



A.E.		Will involve Supplementary. 



H.C.		May therefore be a debate.



Sw.		Para. 9.  Do we contemplate bombing?



de L.	16 Vampires at Aden, in addn. to transport &amp; recce aircraft.  Levies are fully occupied in looking after Yemenis.



A.E.		Will M/D. consider wht sufficient force is being made available.



P.M.	Yes : and satisfy A.E.  

And consult with Ty. on means of avoiding Suppl., e.g. by use of Secret Vote.

									           [Exit de. L.

								   [Enter H.W., B.C., B.H.

		4.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



H.W.	We await final report of Ct. Enquiry.  Hope it will cover efficiency &amp; gloss its statement on willing means.  Expect it by end of next week.  [All strike notices have now bn. w’drawn.

	This was most diff. corner we have rounded so far.  We were lucky.



P.M.	Our aim must now be increased efficiency thro’ eliminn. of redundancy.  100,000 men leave each year.  This gives easy chance to reduce nos.



H.W.	B.T.C. do intend to run down labour force by wastage.



B.C.	Redn. of about 25,000 was achieved last year by this means.  But there is shortage in some grades, with redundancy in others.  Am proposing (to E.P.C.) enquiry into use of man-power on rlways.



H.A.	New capital must be linked with more efficient use of labour.



P.M.	Will this be debated?



A.E.	Might be averted if Govt. cd. make effective statement of policy.



Sal.	Modernisation plan (£100 M) shd. be considered in reln. to capital investment in roads.  Shd. we take snap decisions on rlway plan?



B.C.	Will be chance to look at that in E.P.C.  Moreover, we need do no more than give approval of general line of B.T.C.’s investment policy.



W.	Wd. prefer to see rail and road considered together – by small Cttee.



H.M.	Structure of management of rlways shd. also come under review.  T.U. hacks on B.T.C. command no confidence among men.

									[Enter K.

P.M.	Favour small Cab. Cttee. for this.



A.E.	But statement will need to be made before H/C. has sat for long.



H.W.	M/L. wished me to say tht. changes of personnel in B.T.C. will be needed if further trouble is to be avoided.

								[Exit B-C., G.Ll.



	5.	House of Commons : Redistribution.



Att.G.	Don’t know wtr para. 5 shd. be included.  W.M. has suggd. to me that it wd. be better out.

	Cd. delete passages from my remarks e.g. pp 1-10.  Procedure, old judgements etc.

P.M.	Leave it.



Ll.G.	On Introdn.  Is this necessary?  Includes statement wh. might provoke debate.  Surely M/Rolls has said enough.

	Wd. it not suffice to put copies in Library, vice W.Paper?



Att.G.	Advantages in publishing argument as well as judgement.



L.P.S.	I made us promise to H/C.

	Wd. be enough to put documents in Library, before H/C. meets.

	Don’t favour W. Paper – or Introdn.



K.	Agree.  Put in Library w’out comment.



Att.G.	M/Rolls has corrected his judgement ….



		Agreed : Put copies of pp 3-67 in Library.





	6.	Colonial Immigrants.



Ll.G.	As in memo.



L.P.	Do we need to allow them in on evce. they can m’tain themselves?



A.L.B.	Must have this to cover Dom. citizens, students etc.,



Ll.G.	Shall have to admit tht. it is directed v. immigration of col. people.



L.P.S.	No prospect of getting a majority in H/C. for such a Bill as this.

	All Labour Party wd. oppose it, and quite a number of ours wd. too.



A.L.B.	In long run W. Indies will restrain this movement : for they have lost £1M. on fares, people fr. valuable emplt., and some of their more adventurous elements.



H.B.	Creates social problems for which there is no solution.



H.W.	T.U.C., privately, wd. like introdn. of control.



A.E.	Don’t think we can ignore this problem.



P.M.	Mght be worth bringing this legn. in, even if we can’t pass it.



H.A.	Let our supporters know extent of legn. in other Comm. countries.



Sw.	White Paper.  Will prepare it, with C.O.  Agreed.
