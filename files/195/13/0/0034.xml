H.C.	Shall we suggest that (Wed.) – to avoid debate on cotton industry.



P.T.	Opposn. choice.  Don’t mind Mon. or Wed.  But we shd. make it clear to Opposn. tht. we shall harm Lancs. interests by disclosing how diff. it is for Govt. to take the action they want e.g. the price India wd. exact wd. be higher if diffies. were publicly known.

H.M.	Agreed ground forces in G. shd. have ground-to-ground weapon.  Agreed we shd. not add this to our over-crowded r. &amp; d. p’mme : &amp; tht. we should rely on U.S. type.  Also important to have max. co-opn. with U.S. on guided missile developmt.

	Proposed to buy 113 weapons : but only 24 heads – balance to be used for training w’out atomic heads.

	Wd. be mistake for us to manufacture.



R.A.B.	V. short notice.  Wished Cab. to know tht. I can’t accept, w’out regard to b/p., argument at end of para. 10.  Wd., however, accept Cab. decn.



A.H.	D.P.R. decn. of ’53 not to manufacture here assumed purchase fr. U.S.

	No one cd. say tht. a man was evading service by going into Police.



H.W.	Other pressures – i) agriculture  ii) apprentices on munitions work.

	iii) scientists, esp. teachers.  How can we resist these?



P.M.	Esprit de corps is of gt. importce. to Police.  cf. tradition of service in R.N. among communities nr. Portsmouth etc.,

	Cd. put a limit on it – e.g. 5.000.

	People generally won’t think this is a reason to extend to industrial occupns.  They equate police with Forces.



H.W.	Then we must do our best to resist other pressures.

H.A.	They claim increasg. costs and seek re-coupment in order to m’tain their net income.  We can go some way to meet them.  Another £10 M. might secure agreement.
