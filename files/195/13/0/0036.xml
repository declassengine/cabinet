C.22(55)							9th March, 1955



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Vote of censure (3-Power mtg).  When shd. we have debate, in view of A.E.’s visit to Turkey?  We cd. offer it on 14/3.  But Oppn. may not want it early because of Bevan’s illness.  Then we cd. tell them, if they don’t want early debate, they had better take it off the Paper.



P.M.	V. well.  Offer debate on 14/3.  I will speak first &amp; A.E. will reply.



H.C.	If they then remove Motion, we cd. insert other Business on Wed.



P.M.	Terms of Govt. amendment.  Omit “immediately” : insert “after ratification by all the countries concerned of Ldn &amp; Paris agreements” : and delete words after the date.



B.H.	Confusing to H/C., because of way in which it wd. have to be put by spker.

	Suggest alternative, drafted in consultn. with F.O.



A.E.	Prefer something on those lines – wd. give positive indicn. of our policy.



		H.C. to revise draft, with A.E. &amp; submit to P.M.





		2.	Cotton Industry.



P.T.	May be pressed in debate on countervailing &amp; anti dumping duties.  Wd. prefer to wait until GATT debate : but may have to indicate in this debate tht. we shall be prepared, if necessary, to take powers by legn. to enable us to impose such duties.  May I have authy. to say this?



R.A.B.	This wd. be a legitimate defence, consistent with our trade policy.  I see no objn.



P.T.	Shan’t say it unless I have to.



H.C.	Wd. involve dropping other Bill or Bills.



P.T.	Shan’t promise to legislate this session.

							[Exit B.H.

								[Enter H.W.



		3.	Farm Price Review.			



H.A.	Mid-summer hopes of redn. were frustrated because of i) costs, then dropping, are now increasg.  £40 M. extra next year.  ii) alarming increase in imports of animal feed.  In past 2 yrs. £55 M. increase : and another £28 next year.  iii) v. bad weather.  Bad harvest : no winter sowing in autumn : &amp; now diff. to do spring season.  This foreshadows decrease of £40 M.

	Summing up : £22 M. is generous and defensible imposed settlement.  Lack of agreemt. by farmers may help us with those who are critical of farmers.  But leaders of N.F.U.’s will campaign v. us in rural areas : we shall have to chase them – not easy.  Opposn. will say we have let agric. down in a specially hard season.  

	Promise to think again in spring wd. unsettle things – &amp; wd. mean tht. we wd. have to give more then than we shd. have to give now.

	Alternative : agreed settlement at £28 M.  Wd. win farmers’ support: avoid campaigning in the country.  But wd. be criticised as unduly generous.  

	As farmers will now take ¾d. on milk, I now favour agreed settlement at £28 M.



R.A.B.	V. diff. £28 M. is radically unsound.  ¾d. on milk will produce milk we can’t use.  1d. on eggs also unnecessary.  Both wd. worsen b/p because of increased feed. 

	Injection of money is all they need.  £21.9 M. is enough for that purpose.

	Can’t, in present state of economy, have both quixotic settlement with farmers &amp; a helpful Budget.

	Swinton review contemplated minus £30 M.  We now face plus £20 at the least. 

	Imposed settlement wd. accord with stiffer policy on inflation.

	But N.F.U.’s have stirred up much ill-feeling.  At £22 M., there will be political struggle for rural seats – Tom Williams is in it.

	£22 M. is right but will be attacked by farmers.  £28 M. is wrong but will prob. ensure support for Tories in rural elections.



H.A.	No prospect of agreed settlement on figure betwn. £22 and £28 M.



P.M.	Sense of propn.  Budget covers £400 M. : this is only £6 M.  Against that weigh the consequences.  Public wd. understand lenient view because of bad weather.



R.A.B.	The £22 M. includes already £10 M. on that a/c.



A.E.	More concerned at wrong prices e.g. milk and eggs rather than total.  Everyone knows tht. those are wrong.  Blatant electioneering.



H.A.	Cost on milk wd. rise by 1¼d.  But efficiency is increasing.



A.E.	i)  Don’t want to go above ½d. on milk.

	Cdn’t we stand on that and meet them on other outstandg. diffces.

	Obvious weakness of Govt. on milk wd. be bad electioneering.

	ii) Avoid promise of later review, suggd. with £22 M. settlement.  Much better to have final settlement.



H.A.	I also am against any offer of later review.  Wd. sooner have almost anything rather than that.



D.E.	Delay in spring ploughing is v. serious – creates climate for campaign v. us.

	Any increase in milk price is wrong : ¾d. is no worse than ½d.  I wd. settle.



K.	Monthly milk cheque is crucial to small farmer : &amp; all the more so in this bad season.  Believe this may outweigh economic objns. Psychological advantage.



S.	£22 M. is not enough because of bad season.  No intermediate figure is acceptable.  I wd. therefore go for agreed settlement at cost of £28 M.  Generous settlement to carry them over a specially diff. season.



J.S.	One day we shall have to break &amp; impose a settlement.  But not this year.



R.A.B.	V. worried at inflationary effect.  My original plan was only £9 M. and that was fair.  We have added £10 M. because of bad year argument.

	Now we shall be adding another £6 M.



H.A.	Not consumer money : finance for production (?)



J.S.	£22 M. plus danger of more on a later review might cost Ty. much more.



Ll.G.	We have made v. substantial sacrifices over last 3 settlements &amp; secured no political advantage from it yet.



H.A.	Hard to deny tht. this year is exceptional.  Hard weather is not over even now.



W.	Economics of this is wrong. : but this is not the moment for a row.



Sw.	It is not one bad season, but two because delay in spring sowing.



O.P.	Don’t believe farmers will vote v. us whatever Turner says.

	We may gain more electorally if we have bn. correct.



H.M.	If prodn. is less than estimated, cost to Exch. will be less.

R.A.B.	Shall have to do somethg. more to check inflation, in Budget, if we are not stiff over this.  Economy is too loose.



		Agreed :  go for agreed settlement at £28 M.



H.A.	Propose therefore to tell N.F.U.  Early announcement wd. be desirable.  On Friday there is agricultural debate in H/C. on P. Members’ Motion.  I cd. therefore make announcemt. Thurs. – publish Wh. Paper later that day : then it cd. be discussed in Friday’s debate, which Whips want us to spin out all day.



	Terms of announcemt. to be settled by M/Ag. &amp; R.A.B.



								[Exit A.L.B., H.A.

									[Enter B.C., G.Ll.





4.	Coal Production : St. Leger.				



G.Ll.	Have agreed, with Stewards, to give 2-year trial to holding it on Wednesday.  Do other Dpts. dissent?



R.A.B.	Can’t go on singling out this particular event.





		5.	Coal Prices.



Sw.	Timing.  Local elections.  No announcemt. before April 4.  Better do it in Easter week.



P.M.	Minute from H.W. on effect of prices (esp. household) on wage demands.  Future movemt. of index likely to turn mainly on food prices.  If they don’t drop, coal etc., will cause index to rise.



R.A.B.	Emplt. &amp; prodn. are v. high.  No country in such circs. has ever succeeded in holding c/living so stable.

	Meat prices will prob. come down.



H.W.	All concerned cd. take a lesson from tea – &amp; bring prices down before they face a market strike.



A.E.	Coal industry is abject failure.  Has let the country down.  Is the new N.C.B. going to improve the industry.  What prospect have we of anything but successive price increase to bolster inefficiency.



G.Ll.	Reorganisn. of N.C.B. was drastic step.  The new Bd. have already adopted nearly all Fleck recommns.  Will prob. announce this v. soon.  New Bd. is better than any we have had &amp; is getting on with its job.

	Don’t want to turn down their first proposal.



A.E.	If increases have to be made, don’t like para. 2.  Let N.C.B. do it &amp; do what they want.  Para. 2 will be seen to be electoral.



Sal.	Will you allow them to have all-round increase?  Think that wd. be better.



G.Ll.	I arranged this at request of E.P.C.  Am I to w’draw my earlier suggn.?  Taking risk tht. equal increase shd. go on to house coal.



P.M.	Let N.C.B. re-organise but run on in deficit.



R.A.B.	Hayward &amp; Hambro resigned because they considered N.C.B. was not run on commercial lines.

	Ready however to let N.C.B. do what they think right, even if it means more on cost of house-coal.



H.W.	We cdn’t oppose increases sufft. to cover increased costs.  Was against prices wh. wd. yield more than that.



H.M.	Invite NCB to frame proposals designed to enable them to break even over year (no surplus) – with no Govt. direction re prices of house coal.



R.A.B.	Cab. are not satisfied  	i) tht. NCB has had enough time to consider this.  

ii) price increase alone will solve coal sitn.  Want 

assurances on efficiency &amp; re-organn.

				iii) honest to make no 	increase at all on lower 

grades of house coal. Govt. also want to be out 

of this. 

				iv) on timing.
