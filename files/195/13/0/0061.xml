C.M.19(55)							30th June, 1955



		1.	M.P.’s Salaries.				[Enter B.H.



P.M.	CRA. has said he wants to see me on Ministers’ Salaries and M.P.’s pay.



B.H.	They will say they will agree to Ministers’ salaries if M.P.’s allowances are increased.



P.M.	I will give no encouragement.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.  Monopolies Rpt.  Promise some prelimy. discn. before recess.





		3.	South Africa : Defence Talks.



S.Ll.	Agreemts. concluded.  Publish as Wh. Paper on Monday.  Shd. they be shown in advance to [Leader of] Oppn.?  Before statement (by P.M.) in H/C.



P.M.	Yes : S.Ll. to see C.R.A. on Monday a.m.  He cd. bring Callaghan if he wished.





		4.	Germany : Supplementary Army Estimate.



S.Ll.	Ty want token Estimate.  Form involves alteration of every vote for Army &amp; totals £70.  Timing of this, in reln. to f. affairs &amp; Geneva, is of some importance.



R.A.B	Occupn. ended on 5/5.  If we don’t take token vote, P.A.C. will query lack of Parly. [public] control.  Tho’ we aren’t spending money in fact, Parly. control is needed even if cash provided by 3rd party.  Tho’ this argument wd. have led to our takg. Parly. control 8/9 yrs. ago.

	Doubt if token figure will make debate any more likely.  We can’t give any estimate of real figure.

	We cd. make the token £10.



H.M.	If it’s right to do this now, it shd. have bn. done for Occupn. Costs.  If we do it now, we emphasise earlier error.

	There is no reason to believe tht. any cost will in fact be incurred this year.



R.A.B.	Diffce. is tht. G. is independent sov. Power.



H.M.	More you discuss this in Parlt., less chance you have of getting the money from Germany.



		Agreed :  RAB to consider, with M/D. [and F. Secy.]



H.C.	If done now, we have to provide time.  Later, debate cd. be avoided.





		5.	Foreign Affairs.



H.M.	In U.S. a developing situation.  Dulles is trying to be more flexible.

	On Geneva, believe U.S. want to do business with R.  They won last Election on stopping Korea : they want another such achievemt. before the next.  More risk of U.S. w’drawing fr. Europe than of her launching forestalling war.  They will therefore be disposed to back disarmament, &amp; détente in Europe.

	On F/E they are much less bellicose but don’t know how to extricate themselves.  And rather too many cooks – e.g. Nehru.  Failure of their missions may suggest U.S. recalcitrance.  Risk here therefore is rash action by Chinese.  Need therefore is to press U.S. to keep some overtures going.

	Other countries’ opinion twds Geneva is steady.  France is least certain : but at least they haven’t bn. restive.

								[Enter S., Att.G.



		6.	Administrative Tribunals.



Sal.	On scope : misunderstandings removed.  D.S. to see t. of r. in draft.

	On composition : too many officials, not enough of man in street.  Better to consider on basis of a list of names : see wtr betwn. them they cover a sufficient spread of experience.  Cd. N.B. produce a list of names for discn.?



D.S.	Shd. include someone with knowledge of administration.



								[Exit Att.G.

								[Enter B.C., G.Ll.

		7.	Industrial Disputes : Docks.



W.M.	T.U.C. report.

	Doubt if strike will be called off in consequence.

	Northern men won’t join T.G.W.U.

	Future of Stevedores Union is v. doubtful.  Leaders who remain are not in touch with men in north.  May be a move for wholly new Union.

	Rpt. removes foundn. for sympath. strike : may therefore lead to resumption of work in Ldn.

	Must now see employers.  Also T.GWU., who shd. adopt less intransigent attitude – tho’ he will want to wait for 10,000 to come back to them.  Also, T.U.C., who has been mtg. both Unions.



P.M.	Let it be known tht. you are having these interviews.



Sal.	Opportunity for drastic action, now that TGWU have so little public sympathy.



W.M.     x/	Employers may break thro’ by recognising Stevedores Union.



W.	There must be real dissatisfn. with T.G.W.U. and real desire for own Union.  Hope therefore employers will act as at x/.



W.M.	Their risk wd. be i) TGWU strike  ii) leap-frogging by 2 Unions.



P.M.	Pressure on TGWU wd. be justified now.

	Serious economic effects.  Worse than rlway strike.  Point shd. be made in Speeches : for effects will be felt long ahead.



								[Exit Str.



		8.	European Integration.



R.A.B.	Must be careful over atomic power, common market, &amp; transport.

	Can attend as observer – with caveats on above subjects.

	Dutch wd. gain financially : G. interested in the politics : Fr. &amp; Italy in trade.  Their interests are not v. common.  If we play it slowly, we may prevent actual harm.



H.M.	Invitn. now recd. : it is to “participate in studies”.  Cdn’t we accept that, w’out pressing status of observers.  Put in our caveats, but then accept the invitn. cf. acceptance of Schuman invitation.

	Will suggest a draft to R.A.B.



Sal.	Advise caution.  Don’t believe they have any idea what to do.  On atomics, we have other &amp; more profitable channels for internatl. discussion.



P.T.	Their aim is a common market.  That raises GATT., OEEC. &amp; Comm. relns.  We must at least make it clear that we are not pursuing objectives which they have stated.



H.	Prefer observer status.  Don’t let us be blamed if it goes awry.



D.S.	Prefer H.M.’s line.  Tho’ U.K. not going in, nothg. like this can develop in Europe wh. is not of interest to U.K. cf. our assocn. with Schumania.



H.M.	Labour Govt.’s refusal to join Schumania was based (only) on fact tht. they wd. have bn. asked in advance to accept supra-nationality.  We aren’t now asked to accept anything in advance.  I wd. prefer to get in &amp; bring it round the right way – or stop it.

								[Exit D.C.



		9.	Malta.



A.L.B.	Now at parting of ways.

	Our mil. expre. has distorted economy – tho’ bringing much money.

	Dyarchy has broken down.  All NATO ques, e.g., tho’ for U.K., excite angry passions because of lack of consultn.  

	Some change inevitable.  Olivier’s Party claimed Dom-status.  No case whatever for that.  x/And I have said it isn’t possible./  Alternative : closer assocn. with someone.  There is some feeling in favour of union with Italy.  Mintoff’s Party has advocated closer union with U.K.  “H.O. offer” is no answer to status or to a say in f. affairs or defence.

	x/ / blocks only known way of advance.

	I have expld. snags in N.I. model.  But they want it, qua status &amp; opportunity to debate Malta, as P’smouth, at W’minster.  Mintoff wd. hold plebiscite if we approved in principle.

	Points	i) diff. to rejectan appln. fr. Colony to get closer.

		ii) Labour Party approve in principle.

		iii) Our back benchers think it will be diff. to deny in principle.

		iv) If we reject this, Mintoff will go for independence &amp; Def. 	     Treaty.  And Other Party wd. join him in that.

	R.Commn. wd. be regarded by Malta as delaying.

	Spkers Confce. on detail, after we had accepted or commended in principle.  If this is to happen, let us (rather than Labour) have credit for it.

	Populn. 300,000. Voters 150,000.  On N.I. basis, they wd. have betwn 2 or 3 repves. in Parlt. at W’minster.



P.M.	CRA told me Oppn. thinks this is only way out.

	Saw Mintoff y’day.  He genuinely wants closer assocn.



Sal.	Saw Mintoff  y’day.  V. eccentric proposal.  But diff. to rject.  If we reject, Govt. will be bitterly disillusioned : what shd. we do then?  80% of revenue derives fr. U.K. mil. exp’re.  Their main object is money.  But wd. it be sensible to quarrel with Cyprus because they want to have us and with Malta because they want to come closer to us.  Worried over R.C. opposn.



RAB.	We have spent £27½ M. all told on Malta since ?  And exp’re now is running around £2 M.

	How shall we like a Malta Lobby? [Which way wd. they vote] Will give rise to v. gt. problems.

	Prefer alternative approach. i) End dyarchy.  Reserve f. affairs &amp; def. to Govr.  But have, for these, a Council of Ministers in Malta &amp; in Ldn. or in one or other.  Means Govr. wd. not be autocrat.  ii) Shall have to be generous over aid.  Wd. work out plan : on social services they must help : on capital exp’re we must be more generous.

	In remitting this e.g. to Select Cttee. don’t commit ourselves to having M.P.’s at W’minster.



P.M.	Relieved at R.A.B.’s approach to financial aspects.

	Must be mindful of cumulative effects of e.g. Cyprus, Simonstown, Malta.  Remember Italian incitements of ‘30’s.

	Tho’ eccentric, this proposal may have to be accepted.  It may be a risk : but the other risk is surely larger.  There are many steps to be taken before the Members arrive at W’minster.



H.C.	V. novel constitutional development.

	Shd. there be Sel. Cttee. of both Houses, w’out advance commitment in principle.



D.S.	Cttee. of Ministers?



H.A.	Welcome some form of assocn., but consider v. carefully what.



S.Ll.	This may be psychol. moment for stopping the rot.  From defence angle, we don’t want trouble in Malta – on top of all the others.



A.L.B.	No objn. to refce. to Sel. Cttee., or other body, so long as we indicate

	     */	some sympathy or acceptance of principle.



Ll.G.	i) Views of Church.  ii) Chandos’ third point : narrow majorities.



P.M.	They fought their Election on this &amp; won it.



P.T.	Enough on x/ to say we don’t rule it out.



A.L.B.	Something like that mght do : wd. want to consider form of words.



P.M.	Joint Select Cttee. of both Houses., with some indication ? of sympathy twds this concept.



RAB.	Wd. like to see detailed plan before being committed.



H.M.	Welcome it : have it examined : let it break, if it must, on financial or economic difficulties.



Sal.	Propose formal discns. with Maltese with a view to devising plan acceptable to both Parliaments.



		Cab. to resume discn. on Tuesday, on basis of considered plan 	by C.O. in light of discussion &amp; with draft of early 	announcement.

									[Exit J.T.



		10.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	They are likely to get in : 26 votes.

	11th. Aug. is latest date.

	Sitn. in Geneva is confused because Germans have made a blob. We cd. let that develop a little.

	Recommend we wait another 2 weeks.  No action m’while.



		Agreed : H.M. to bring it up next week, if he is unwilling to 	wait longer.
