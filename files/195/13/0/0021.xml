C.7(55)								27th January, 1955



								[Enter B.H.

		1.	Parliament.



H.C.		Business for next week.

		Debate on Rlways – 3/2.

	Propose to discuss with Oppn. the form of debate &amp; seek their agreement to it being held on adjournment.  Opposn. want a separate debate later on Modernisation – taken with 2nd. Rdg. of Borrowing Bill.

		Govt. spokesman : H.W. and R.A.B.



R.A.B.	I wd. welcome chance to make plain our view on wages in natd. industries.  Wd. need, in that, to refer to modernisation plans.  Must correct impn. tht. arose from para. 10 of Interim Rpt.

		Wd. speak on this at dinner-time &amp; leave M/T. to reply.



P.M.		Leave M/T. out – and let R.A.B. reply to debate.



H.C.		Discussion of delays in aircraft prodn.



P.M.		2 day debate on Defence W. Paper.  Cd. have had speech then by M/S.



H.M.	V. diff.  W’in few days we will have decide wtr to abandon Swift.  Can’t settle it until after P.M. mtg.  Debate shd. follow as soon as poss. after that decision.

		Alternatives :



P.M.	x/	Shd. we put out W. Paper on it.



H.M.		Prefer 2-day debate on Def. W. Paper &amp; allot one day to aircraft prodn.

		Paras in Def. W. Paper mght be thght enough for x/.



A.E.		Not sure we can wait until general debate.  There is much disquiet.

		It mght pay us to have separate W. Paper.



P.M.		Agree.



H.M.		They may demand separate debate.  



A.E. 		Cd. resist that.



H.C.	Have promised time for debate on cap. punishment – Report of B.C.  We shall have to consider form of such a debate.  Can’t avoid vote on main issue of abolition.  Wd. mean free vote.









	2.	Bank-Rate.



R.A.B.		Bank rate will be raised to-day by ½%.

	There are signs of inflation – reflected in speeches by Bank Chairmen.

	Will have psychol. influence.  Will give confidence.  Demonstrates flexibility of rate.



										[Exit B.H.

		3.	Formosa.



A.E.	Discns. going badly.  Last minute amendmts. by Dulles, who will destroy all chance of success of Oracle.

	U.S. policy seems now to have bn. designed to secure support for military action – not for settlement.

	U.S. Govt. have declined to accept (20 votes to 8) motion designed to limit action to Formosa &amp; Pescadores.  This will alarm opinion here.

	U.S. reluctance to make plain statement of their policy increases my diffies.

		None the less Oracle is going fwd. to-morrow.



									[Enter H.B.

		4.	Foreign Service : Estimates Committee.



A.E.		Seek authority to present on 31/1.



H.B.		This is agreed document – as betwn. 3 Junior Ministers.



H.C.	Shall be asked about visits of H/C. Cttees. overseas.  Shall stand by what I have said.

					Approved.

									[Exit H.B.

									[Enter G.Ll.



		5.	National Coal Board : Re-organisation.



									[Re-enter B.H.

G.Ll.	Have received report of Fleck Cttee.

	Its appointment was negotiated with critics etc., on basis tht. the enquiry wd. be instituted by N.C.B. itself.

	Report emphasises importce. of leadership by Bd.  But one recommn. addressed to me viz., tht. Bd. be re-constituted on functional basis.  This is step precedent to implementg the rest.

	Rpt. will be ready for publn. in 2 wks’ time.  Propose m’while to go ahead with re-constitn. of Bd. – consultg.  RAB on names.  Want to announce reconstitn. of Bd. at same time as report is publd.



R.A.B.	Misgivings in city about Chairman.  G.Ll. has reasons for allowg Houldsworth to finish out his term.  But we shall find opposn. to this among leaders of industry.  May not therefore be able to complete re-constitn. before publn. of report.

	Think we must keep open, pro-tem., wtr Chairman shd. stay or go.

	Ready, however, to try for simultaneous announcement.



G.Ll.	Houldsworth is important qua confidence of the men.  His present appmt. will expire in July ’56.



O.P.		If he left now, under a cloud, this wd. have bad effect on industry.



									[Exit G.Ll.

									[Enter Att.G.

									[Exit A.E.

		6.	Horror Comics.



Ll.G.		Bill is drawn as narrowly as possible.



Att.G	i)	Cl. 2. provides higher penalties &amp; trial on indictmt. for 2nd. offence.

Election for trial will disclose there is pre. conv.  Suggest higher penalty be provided for 1st. offence – so that anyone can elect to go for trial.								Agreed.

ii)	Prosecution will turn on one copy.  Wd. like freedom to bring evce. of earlier nos. in same series, to prove cumulative effect.



K.		Yes : if words can be found.  Will consider with Att.G.



Att.G.	iii) Final words of Cl. 1.  Is the effect to incite to crime – or rather to bring our system of law into contempt.  Wd. like to consider with K. &amp; Ll.G. wtr this idea cd. be imported into the clause.



P.M.		Approve draft Bill in principle.  Legn. Cttee. can consider these points.



									[Enter S.W.

		7.	Prince of Hanover.



P.M.		Why is this application being resisted?

		

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





Att.G.	We are not opposing the claim – merely seeking clarification of the legal position.  Shall ask ct. to grant decln., not to refer it back to Home Secretary.



K.		I was influenced by consns. in para. 6.  Better to leave this to the courts.
