C.27(55)							30th March, 1955.



		1.	Four-Power Meeting.				[Enter B.H.



A.E.	Current posn., after ratification.





		2.	Anglo-Iraq Treaty.



A.E.	Agreemt. signed last p.m.  V. good for us – esp. as enabling us to pre-stock in Iraq.  We have 2nd. in command at Habbaniyah &amp; Shaiba &amp; use of other airports too.  We also have exclusive right to train Iraq Air Force – wh. will get our equipmt. in, &amp; they have cash to pay with.

	Want to clinch it, before anythg. intervenes as riots did last time.  Propose therefore to offer (by Motion) Oppn. debate on Monday, if they want one.



R.A.B.	No free arms.  And cleared up old claims.  V. good.





		3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.





		4.	Non-Industrial Employment Bill.



H.G.	Based on Gowers Rpts.  Unsuitable for Priv. Member’s Bill – wd. need v. careful scrutiny in Cttee.  But we cdn’t oppose it.  What is our spokesman to say?  Promise Govt. legn. when time permits?



W.M.	We aren’t all in favour?  I am.



H.A.	I’m anxious we shd. get credit for legn. providg. for safety in agric.



P.T.	Don’t get commd. to whole Gowers Rpt. v. gt. cost to employers.  We shd. make some advance in this field, but cautiously.



K.	Quoted Simonds remarks in H/L in June ’52.

	At H.O. I received 8 deputns. on this from T.U.C.  We shd. be f’coming.



R.A.B.	Bound to be in an election manifesto : tho’ in cautious terms.  Agric. &amp; rlways certainly.  Shops more controversial.  Prob. best to go fwd. by sections.



H.A.	28.000 accidents p.a. in agriculture.



H.C.	Avoid welfare aspects of Gowers on agriculture.



P.M.  	Let Ll.G. submit to me text of what his Under Secy. wd. say.



H.C.	Better not to get this into Cttee.  Wd. they not w’draw it on promise of Govt. legn.?  Otherwise we shd. have odium of proposing amendmts. etc.,



H.A.	Wd. have to be v. f’coming in order to stop 2nd. Rdg.



Ll.G.	Wh. cd. support intentions but criticise detail of this Bill : promise to legislate later : invite them to w’draw.



P.M.	Try to persuade promoters to w’draw it after debate.

	If that fails, let it go into Cttee. stage.



K.	We need separate Bills – agric., rlways, shops etc., 

	Try to keep debate going all day.  No harm in moving closure.



H.C.     x/ 	In this event authorise prepn. of Govt. Bills.  We must be ready to redeem our promises.	

								[Enter Munster.





5.	Officers’ Pensions.



Sal.	Motion by Ld. Jefferys in H/L. – will prs. be taken to Divn. in which event we shd. be beaten.  What line shd. we take?  Invite rejection or propose reasoned amendment?  Submitted draft.  Think H/L. might be persuaded to accept such an amendment.



Sw.	Has advantage of setting out what has bn. done.



R.A.B.	Wd. prefer to omit reference to c/living.  Otherwise, I agree.

	Eventually we must have Pensions Increase Bill.



							[Exit Munster.





		6.	National Service.



H.M.	Bellenger’s P.Q. No. 57.

	Propose to reply by reference to para. 67 etc., of Def. White Paper.

	Or shd. I say : I doubt wtr enquiry by Sel. Cttee. of H/C. wd. be helpful.  That wd. leave more room for manoeuvre.



H.C.	Then they will say – have another kind of enquiry.



A.E.	Prefer first alternative.  More honest.





							[Exit B.H.

7.	Renfrew Maintenance Base.				[Enter S.Ll., B.C. 



	Not heard.  Memo. approved.				[Exit S.Ll.

[Enter Att.G.



		8.	Industrial Disputes.



		(a)	Newspapers.



W.M.	Proprietors won’t negotiate.  Unions won’t accept arbitn.

	Owners have now given notice to printers &amp; compositors – who will be out by mid-April.

	Pure wages dispute : diff therefore to have Ct. of Enquiry.

	Am seeing other Unions concerned: they may lead E.T.U. &amp; A.E.U. into negotn.

	N.P.A. are being blackmailed &amp; don’t therefore want to be given chance of compromise.



		(b)	Docks.



	New books under Dock Scheme are issued on 1/4.  In Ldn. issued automat. to all on register.  On Merseyside they have had to show Union Membership.  Thousands (3-4.000 at least) have t’ferred to Blue Union.  Legal opinion given tht. proof was needed of T. &amp; G. W. Union membership.  I told Deakin this interpretn. wd. provoke a strike.  And that I cdn’t defend such a closed shop.  I therefore asked Lpl. Bd. to hand out books to anyone on register, whichever Union he belonged to.  The Dock Labour Bd. invited local Bds. so to act : but despite advice of H.Q. of Stevedores Union local repves. of that Union didn’t back it.  Now believe they will come into line.

	Deakin has now seen tht. this is not an issue on which to fight Stevedores’ Union.

          Later: 	Mersey dockers return to work Thurs. a.m.		[Exit B.C.

								[Enter Birch.





9.	Colonial Office Building.



H.C.	Cttee. concluded against – partly because of cost, partly because of diffies. of legn. involved.



P.M.	But shd. we thus impede the leisurely consn., over years, of the grander design?

	All we have to decide now is wtr we block that possibility by erecting this new bldg.



H.C.	If we don’t build, we shd. have to legislate to enable site to be held open.



D.S.	Parlt. gave powers to erect bldg. not C.O. bldg.  If we said we were considerg. larger project, we needn’t legislate until we are ready to go fwd. with that project.

	Surveyors, if told planning permn. to re-build wd. be w’held, they wd. have option of continuing in present bldg &amp; wd. prefer that to being bought out.  Shan’t have to buy until ready to go on.



Att.G.	V. doubtful if planning consent cd. properly be w’held because wider project was under considn.  Using planning consent as prelimy. to compulsory purchase.



R.A.B.	Large project needs more thought.

	But cd. we not build C.O. on R’mond Terrace.  Thus avoid prejudging wider plan.  And negotiate about that.

	Mght need legn. sometime to validate diff. user of W’minster Site.



H.A.	Then we cd. air idea of grander project.



A.E.	Other claims to R’mond Terrace – if we don’t use Carlton Terrce.



O.P.	Favour keeping wider project open.



Sal.	Prefer R’mond Terrace.  Wd. like, however, to avoid any announcemt. of grander project because of its cost.  Just keep that open.



Ll.G.	Don’t want C.O. on W’minster site.



N.B.	No problem for F.O. if Carlton House Terrce. plan goes fwd.



A.E.	Agree tht. C.O. need is greater than F.O.



R.A.B.	Shall have to tackle C.H. Terrce. soon because it’s falling down.



D.E.	General enquiry into accommn. of all Dpts., in order to concentrate into units.



W.	M’while, bldg on R’mond Terrace cd. begin.



A.E.	If Cab. agree tht. C.H. Terrce. in some form must go fwd. I wdn’t object to C.O. going to R’mond Terrace.



N.B.	May I warn Surveyors not to incur expense.  They have L.C.C. planning consent, in principle.



D.S.	Wd. want L.C.C. approached at same time.  I wd. prefer to do both myself.



P.M.	D.S. and N.B. to tackle Surveyors &amp; L.C.C.



R.A.B.	Ear-mark R’mond Terrace for C.O.

	Let Ministers concerned look further into greater project.



A.L.B.	No announcemt. m’while.  For C.O. may have to go back to W’minster site.



							[Exit N.B., Att.G.



		10.	Review of G.A.T.T.



P.T.	U.S. have signed most of amendmts. &amp; are putting it to Congress.  This statement will help U.S. to pass it – wh. will be in our interest.



Sw.	Delete some “certains” fr. para. 6.



			Agreed.





		11.	Cotton Industry.



P.T.	Plan outlined in C. 88.

	V. gt. diffies. : Thus –

	i)  Quota cd. only be a holding operation, preceding tariff.

	A permanent quota wd. be inconsistent with all our policies.

	ii) Incln. of Hong Kong.  Omission wd. involve discrimn. w’in Comm. v. India/Pak. alone: wd. encourage expansion of prodn. in H-Kong : it is worst offender because most of it is retained in U.K. &amp; amount is expanding rapidly.  Ought therefore to extend to H.Kong : &amp; this action v. a Colony wd. be v. serious.



P.M.	Cd. be justified as emergency measure because of increased popn. of Colony.



P.T.	I don’t commend this plan.  Breach of GATT., also of free-entry policy : protn. of industry enjoying 90% of home market : wd. provoke demands fr. industies. with stronger claims : re-negotn. of Indian Trade Agreemt : legn. for tariff : risk of retaliation: deals only with ⅓rd. of problem.

	Wd. prefer other means – as in last para.  Removal of p. tax wd. be best method.  No internl. problem.  Popular with Tories.

	But, if we do use quota, prefer to associate it with other measures – C.89.

	Courses i) no action ii) p. tax alone iii) quota alone iv) package as in last para. of C. 88.

	I believe that, commercially, ii) is best course.



A.L.B.	This wd. be first imposn. of quota v. Hong-Kong in its history.  At a time when we have ruined her entrepot trade because of our policy twds China.  This trade in cotton rescued them from ruin.  And folly to do it on morrow of securing Colonial waiver.



P.T.	Cdn’t impose quota which didn’t apply to H-Kong.



W.M.	Para 7 of C. 88 shows this clearly.



A.L.B.	Can’t stultify our Colonial policy because of tempy. pol. diffy. in U.K.



R.A.B.     x|	We must have a smaller mtg. on this to elaborate a plane.

                  |	RAB., P.T., Sw., A.L.B., H.M. plus F.O. Minister,. W.

	Temporary limitn. pending discn. with other Comm. countries concerned.



A.L.B.	Doesn’t help me because U.K. dictates policy for H Kong and needn’t discuss with them.



		Agreed as at x/.  Report to Cabinet next week.
