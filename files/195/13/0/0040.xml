C.26(55)							23rd May 1955



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	28/3.  Motion for memorial to Ll.G. – 10 years having passed since his death.

	Privilege : motion for Debate : Driberg.  Wd. be better to refer it to Cttee. on Privileges.  Can debate it on their report.  Wd. save 2 debates.





		2.	G.A.T.T. Review.



P.T.	Propose to answer P.Q.’s by promising White Paper.  Intend to publish it before Easter.



A.E.	Well received.



R.A.B.	Waivers are popular : rest is unintelligible.



							[Enter Att. G.





		3.	Buganda: Kabaka.



A.L.B.	Kabaka’s daughter, with polio, has come to U.K. for treatment by Cohen!

	Nov. last I stated tht. K. mght return in 6 months.  Dec., a Cttee. was appointed on constitutional ques : report expected soon, and may be unhelpful.  Delay in allowg. K.’s return is due to action taken in Uganda.  That has bn. made clear to K.





4.	Railway Charges.				[Enter G.Ll., B.C.



B.C.	Having ourselves provided by our Act of ’53 machinery for quick action w’out intervention of Ministers, it wd. be wiser to let it work.  Decisions wd. be by Tribunal, on merits of appln.



W.M.	0.07 increase in c/living.



Sw.	Timing : Ldn. &amp; suburban is most important.  Raises only £4 M. in full year.  How long wd. Tribunal take over it?



B.C.	2-4 wks : mtg. in private.



Sw.	Big money £17.7 M. is long-distance fares, &amp; that can’t be stopped.  V. useful, however, if appln. for Ldn. increases were delayed for some weeks.



K.	Agree.  Freights also have little pol. interest.  If we allowed B.T.C. to go on with freights &amp; long-distance, that wd. show we were concerned about their finances.  They cd. surely be persuaded to delay the other.



B.C.	Main-line increases wd. be announced end/April.

	On Ldn. fares, Tribunal’s award wd. be known in 4 weeks’ time : and introdn. wd. be considered then.



Sal.	Redundancy.  Public will resent increased fares before results shown on that.



B.C.	Para 4 of earlier memo : appln. assumes economies of £15 M.



Att.G.	Cd. M/T. “consult” B.T.C. to see wtr direction wd. be required : then spin it out.  B.T.C. cd. hardly make appln. to Tribunal while this was going on.



K.	Para. 5.  He has also to consult Tribunal on freights.  Why doesn’t he do that first : then his Regs.  M’while asking B.T.C. not to go to Tribunal on fares until freights are cleared.



W.	Then, also, we cd. argue that fares shd. all come in together : and that main-line increases shd. not be made until London fares are ready for introduction.  Press that on B.T.C.



A.E.	You cd. also ask B.T.C. for further assurances on redundancy.  We must have an answer on that, if increased fares are to be justified to public.



P.M.  	Brief but decent delay.

							[Exit Att.G. G.Ll. B.C.



	

5.	Cotton Industry.



P.T.	No decision to-day.  Cab. shd., however, know issues.

	i)  short-time working in Lancs., whatever we do.  Likely to face some permanent contraction of industry.

	ii) ⅔rds of diffy. arises from exports : but most of complaint is about imports.

	Imports fr. India &amp; H-Kong.  150  m. yards last year, now running at 200 m. yards &amp; disproportionate increase is fr. H-Kong.  Reason : cheaper labour &amp; entry duty free.

	Cotton Bd. seek quota while we re-negotiate agreemts giving Commomw. free entry.  Look at diffies. of that.  We cd. never w’draw quota.  We shd. be commd. to protn. on permanent basis : &amp; effects wd. go wider than India and cotton.

	If some action is essential – vital need is to avoid retaliation by non-Comm. world &amp; quota restn. v. our exports.  Least damaging wd. be to have holdg. quota on retained grey-cloth

Exports.  Suppose we take above action, benefit to Lancs. is slight – short-time &amp; contn. will continue.  Pressure will switch to export problem.  ⅔rds of short-time unconnected with grey cloth. And Lancs. remedy for that is removal of purchase tax : wh. hits quality end, wh. is their ultimate salvation.  That case will be deployed in next 3 months whatever we do on imports.  If in end we gave way on that we shd. suffer twice.



R.A.B.	Last time we placed £20 M. orders ahead.  *Perhaps H.M. will review chances of doing any more of that.

             a./	We may come to a quota.  Go on studying it.

	But first try one last appeal to India.

	If that fails, I wd. prefer quota under Art. XIX of G.A.T.T.  Don’t want to breach G.A.T.T. at once.  Art. XIX quota wd. be non-discriminatory.

	Try to get it regarded as temporary measure.

	We, as  Govt., must  clear our minds on tariff policy.

            x/	Prs. we shd. also promise to examine cotton industry prospects.

	Think we shd. say we will examine p. tax.  Wdn’t. affect much of Lancs. trade : &amp; wd. have enormous repercussions.  Can’t accept Lancs. argument on that.

		Suggest we consider quota (temporary) but say we will 	examine prospects of cotton industry, not excldg. effect on it of 	p. tax.



Sw.	Favour personal appeal to Nehru.



W.	Indian Govt. are selling raw cotton to their textile industry below world price.



Sw.	That is not for purpose of cheap manufre. but to prevent land being turned over from food to cotton.



A.L.B.	Hong Kong has no duties v. Br. exports.

	Her posn. is v. different.  Thus –

	i)  we have restricted entrepot trade because of cold-war.

	ii) post-war industrial developmt. has taken its place, &amp; much of that is grey cloth.

	iii) we cdn’t restrict entry of H. Kong cloth alone : it wd. have to be Colonial quota.  And W.Indies are sending some to U.K.

	iv) how wd. quota look at same time as Colonial waiver under G.A.T.T.  We shd. look v. foolish.

P.T.	Approach to Nehru.  We have approached Indian Govt.  They have no more control over their exporters than we have over our importers.  He will reject our appeal.

	Art XIX.  We must seek to limit damage to other exports.  When imports fr. Eur. are falling &amp; we impose quota because Comm. imports are raising, we invite retaliation.

	Easier to defend tempy. discriminatory quota while we examine tariff.

	Be careful of x/.  We shall land ourselves with financial &amp; political

        y/	headaches.  Leave Lancs. to solve own problems.  Confine ourselves to proper Govt. action- taxn. &amp; tariffs.



W.	I strongly agree with y/.



P.T.	P. tax relief cd be justified.



A.E.	Not impressed by Cotton Bd. arguments.  Shd. hear wht they say.

	Agree to examine a/.  But retaliation risk is v. high.

	Colonies are going to be uncomfortable qua imports to U.K.  What can we do to off-set it by increased exports fr. U.K. (Lancs.) to African Colonies.

	P. tax.  This deserves some examinn.

	We oughtn’t to do quota alone because exports is real problem.

	How wd. quota affect Canada, U.S.A. cf. effect on our exports of bicycles to U.S.



A.L.B.	Have asked all Colonies to consider [reduction/exclusion of Japanese cotton goods on b/paymts. grounds.



R.A.B.	Deputn. doesn’t expect an answer to-morrow.
