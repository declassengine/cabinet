C.86(54)							14th December, 1954



		1.	Foreign Affairs.



		(a)	Saar.



A.E.	Dangerous sitn. threatening 9 Power Agreemt.

	M-France has prepd. paper for Fr. Chamber – wh. is inaccurate : includes references to U.K. &amp; U.S. attitude.  Dulles will repudiate what is said of U.S.  Adenauer has said he cdn’t support Agreemts on 15/12 as planned, in his Parlt., if M-France posn. remains unchanged.

	Can’t allow this to drift.

	Had suggested A. mght come to Paris : but that wd. be too late for his debate.  A. has asked for 4 Power mtg : M-France is reluctant : but I think we ought prs. to have it in Bonn before NATO mtg.

	Will submit recommns. to P.M.



		(b)	Formosa.



A.E.	Nutting’s T.V. performance in U.S.  Two bad points – i) parallel with Korea.  There is no parallel : we don’t recognise Govt. of Formosa 

	ii) I have avoided any statement on F. : for, as we don’t recognise Chiang’s Govt., it is diff. to define what our obligns. wd. be if it were attacked.

	Propose to say tomorrow tht. his purpose was to make it plain tht. our only oblign. arises fr. fact tht. Chiang’s Govt. is member of U.N.  Also that posn. has not altered.



P.M.	These were loaded ques.  



A.E. 	And he had no advance warning.  Must have rule tht. Ministers shd. decline invitns. to T.V. interv. in U.S.





		2.	Defence Policy : Fall-out etc.,



H.M.	N.A. Council : form of resolution proposed by us to U.S. &amp; Canada.  Confusion in Press betwn. basis of planning &amp; right of commrs. to start a war.  We mustn’t abandon our posn. that right to authorise operations is reserved to Govts.



A.E.	Draft resoln. put, so far, only to U.S. &amp; Canada.

	Canada are suggesting amended version.

	U.S. agree i) Govts. must retain right to take final decns. ii) SACEUR must plan on basis of using th. nucl. weapons iii) no need for resoln. enough to let SACEUR continue to plan.  Catch is under iii) : for w’out a resolution we can’t say in Parlt. tht. posn. is reserved because of what is in existg. authority on Alerts.



H.M.	Agree – pass our resoln. : get Alert system reviewed.



A.E.	Need for resolution is emphasised by Press comments.



H.M.	Ques of Devolution to one or two Govts (P.M.’s paper) cd. be worked out under review of Alerts.  Proviso in existg. authority is too wide : doesn’t take a/c of the thermo-nuclear point.



D.S.	Beware of frustration by veto of one NATO Power.



H.M.	That wdn’t prevent action by U.S./U.K.

	What we must do, qua Press, is to make it plain i) tht. there is difference betwn. planning and starting operations ; and ii) tht. no mil. commr. has power to start any war, except in retaliation against atomic or nuclear attack.

	Saceur’s plans will need to be re-cast, in light of fall-out, which mght. blot out W. Germany if wind was wrong.



A.E.	We must have right of final decision, save in event of prior atomic or thermo-nuclear attack.



P.M.	Advantage of decln. as in para 2. – wd. give us support for bldg. up deterrent.  Wd. help with our own public opinion.



A.E.	Will consider that.

	P.M.’s memo. is broadly consistent with our plan for N.A.T.O.

	Para. 10 needs study.  We cd. submit memo. on how much R. know. (para. 10(c)).  They know a lot.  Chinese don’t.  Perhaps at PMM we mght invite Nehru to educate Chinese. 

	Don’t favour mtg. with R. on this alone.  Mtg or not, we shd. study this ques.



Sw.	 {	A. and N.Z. – cd. we give them advance informn. of our attitude in 

            *  {	N.A.T.O.?

A.E.	 {	Will consider.



		(b)	Formosa(cont’d).



A.E.	Too dangerous to go on with Oracle now.  We

	Memo. handed in on line to be taken in Paris mtg.





		3.	Hydrogen Bomb.



		a)	B.B.C. Programme.



Sal.	B.B.C. planning p’mme on H. Bomb. for Jany.

	Jacob has promised Plowden i) to enquire ii) to put his people in touch with reputable atomic scientists iii) to vet p’mme himself to ensure it’s not fellow-traveller inspired.

	Need we go further?



P.M.	I think they shd. be told not to do it w’out submn. of text for Govt. scrutiny.



D.S.	Not for B.B.C. to start educatg. public on this.  Govt. must preserve right to determine.



P.M.	cf. para 7 of my memo.

	Referred also to Xmas b’cast.



H.M.	Can’t have BBC going off in advance of Govt. decision on public handling of this ques.



Sal.	Better to tell them to keep off it altogether than to edit text.



P.M.	We ask to see text in order to decide wtr it is in public interest.





		4.	Railway Wage Dispute.	[Enter B-C., H.B., S.Ll., G.Ll.



W.M.	Result of B-C.’s mtg. with N.U.R.

	Action now must be quick – this week – if its to be effective.  Suggest B.C. and I shd. see R., in light of last night’s mtg.  R. told N.U.R. in Aug. tht. he didn’t regard arrangemts wh. resulted in Oct. agreemt.

             x|	were ideal or final.  Want also to discuss wtr this is good moment for making a stand on wages generally.



B.C.	R. won’t go further unless Govt. take responsibility, wtr by direction or public statement.



W.M.	That brings Govt. into a wages negotn. in natd. industry – for first time.



P.M.	If R. says he can’t afford to pay more, is that a final posn.?  Has the Govt. no say.  Natn. gives Govt. a responsibility.



W.M.	Lowest paid in this industry are not worse off than others in comparable positions.  Want to know R.’s  position on that – cf. x/ above.



A.L.B.	Last year public thght rlwaymen were under-paid.  They had public sympathy.  Also real hope of move to labour efficiency.

	Neither is true this year.



H.A.	Can’t we shame Union into seeking arbitn.



W.M.	Doubt it : they know they won’t get anything out of it.



B.C.	They think arbitrator wd. take a/c of financial posn. of rlways.



W.M.	Can’t leave out of a/c what industry can afford to pay – in a natd. industry.



		W.M. and B.C. to discuss position further with R.



A.E.	Stress	i)  they are not under-paid relatively.

		ii) they refuse arbitn.  Surely unwise for Govt. to offer help in 	natd. industry when that right isn’t exhausted.



B.C.	Diffy. about i) is what B.T.C. said to them in Aug. – x/ above.



A.E. 	Don’t encourage R. to say they aren’t paid enough.





		5.	Parliamentary Constituencies.			[Exit S.Ll., G.Ll.



		[Not heard.]





		6.	Japan : Admission to G.A.T.T.



A.E.	Want 10(c) – study by officials.



P.T.	Agree.  But can they analyse effects of J.’s admission.

		{ consider alternative courses.

		{ examine commercial treaty.

	Reserve decision on Art 35 m’while.



P.M.	Report in Jany.



P.T.	No special hurry – shdn’t have to decide on Art 35 for 3-6 months.

	

A.E.	Commercial treaty shd. not involve contraventn. of G.A.T.T. – shdn’t assume we invoke Art. 35.



				Agreed – as above.
