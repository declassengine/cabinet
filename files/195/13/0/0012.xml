C.90(54)							21st December, 1954



		1.	Parliamentary Constituencies.		[Enter B.H., Att.G.



H.C.	Appeal was won.  But P.M. decided last night it wd. be better to p’pone Parly. procdgs until after Xmas recess.  To do otherwise mght have made it impossible to rise on 22/12.

	But statement must be made.  Draft submitted.

	First para. is subject to revision by Att. Genl.



P.M.	Stiffen 2nd. para?  



Att.G. 	Yes : wd. be correct.  



W.M. 	So long as we don’t provoke Cts.  



Formula approved.

		Draft approved.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for first week after recess.



							            [Exit Att.G., BH.

		3.	Atomic Energy : Civil Use.			[Enter S.Ll., G.Ll.



L.P.	Urgency : contract for uranium – bargaining will be easier if it’s known we have a civil p’mme.  Early consultn. with B.E.A.

	This p’mme doesn’t conflict with mil. p’mme – save in war, when civil wd. go to wall.

	Feasible – &amp; chance of economic basis w’in 10 yrs.  Nec. to meet increasg. demand for electricity – wh. coal cd. not meet.

	May cost £300 M. over 10 years.  But p’mme is flexible.  Results, on cost, may be more favourable than now forecast.

	Seek approval of proposals in para. 8.



R.A.B.	Entirely agree.  Ty. has bn. in from outset. We shd. not to-day commit ourselves beyond first £50 M.  That I welcome.  Future course can be left open for decn. in light of developmts.

	Will be of great importance to U.K. economy.



P.M.	Studied in detail by A.E. Cttee.



H.M.	Mil. p’mme not fixed beyond 1960.  Material up to then is secured.  After that date, we may want more material – conceivably might have to raid civil p’mme.



J.S.	Hope separate Scottish electricity bds – will be brought in.

May I see statement before it is made.



L.P.	Will put it to Cabinet.  Announcement prs. after Recess.

		Proposals in para. 8 approved.



								           [Exit G.Ll.

		4.	Renfrew Maintenance Base.			           [Enter B-C.



S.Ll.	Airwork think they will get contract, but can’t settle until Canadian Govt. repve. sees premises.  Can we leave it on basis tht. if contract is secured, B.E.A. shd. move.



R.A.B.	V. likely that they will get contract &amp; take the premises.



S.Ll.	Emplt. for 300 for at least one year, with prospect of continuing work.



P.M.	I wd. give this a miss for a year – on pol. &amp; strategic grounds.



H.M.	On balance, I wd. make the move if this contract is secured.  If it isn’t, review it again.



A.L.B.	Must hold posn. tht. if they get contract, they can have the premises.



P.M.	No objn. to that.



J.S.	Don’t lose this contract.  For B.E.A.’s case has support of majority.



							            [Exit S.Ll.

		5.	Parking Meters.				[Enter Selkirk.



B.C.	You asked for this.  Here it is.



Ll.G.	More work, not less, for Police – at outset.



B.C.	In reply to L.P., experiment – but must be on relatively large scale.



		Approved.	

								 

								[Exit B.C. Selkirk

		6.	New Colonial Office Building.		[Enter Sal., P.T.



R.A.B.	Environs of proposed open site wd. not be attractive.  St. Geo. St. bldgs are not good : wd. cost a lot to improve them.

	Where is C.O. to go, m’while?



A.L.B.	Present bldgs are most unsatisfactory.  Must make a start on a new home.  Was to have bn. opened in ’51 &amp; finished in ’55.



N.B.	Disadvantages of delay  	i) we acquired site compulsorily for Govt. office.  If we want to use for difft. purpose legn. wd. be necessary.

					ii) Chartered surveyors are about to re-build.  Cdn’t. make a real clean job w’out acquiring that too.  Wd. raise total cost to £5 M.



D.E.	Was not a good scheme, but no alternative now but to go on with it.  Efficiency demands tht. H.Q. of Govt. offices shd. be in single bldg.  No other site for C.O. save Carlton House Terrace – wh. wd. accommodate C.R.O. as well in combined Dpt.



N.B.	Horseferry Rd. site is another possibility for C.O.



		Adjourned – for sight of [new] model.



								[Exit N.B.

		7.	Price of Sugar.



R.A.B.	As in memo.

	½ lb. is a nuisance but only a small one - .08 on c/l. index.



H.A.	Margin has increased by only 15%.  Profits &amp; dividends have not increased out of propn. turnover.  Can’t press them to carry any part of this.



P.M.	Awkward to do it now – in advance of o.a.p.



O.P.	Wd. like it delayed until after 7/2 when Assistce. rates go up.



R.A.B.	I need the money to pay the pensions etc.,



H.M.	Everyone else has to lose money on stocks unwisely bought.

	World price is falling – U.K. price is put up.



Sw.	Cdn’t it be done later in spring – at cost of £3 M.



R.A.B.	Ready to discuss a convenient date with M/L. and M/P.  Ready to consider deferment until Feby.



		Approved in principle.

		R.A.B. to settle a date, in consultn. with others &amp;report to P.M.
