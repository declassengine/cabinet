C.82(54)							6th December, 1954



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.		[Enter B-C., B.H.



W.M.	Talks broken off to-day.  May therefore be attempt to stage a Xmas strike.

	Memo. being submd. for Cab. discussion on Wedy.

	B.T.C. will seek interview with M/T.

							[Exit BC.



		2.	House of Commons Disqualification : Peter Baker, M.P.



H.C.	By Saty. time for appeal will have expired.  Must be able to indicate our view or decn. by Mon.  Some doubt wtr removal from H/C. is automatic.

	Propose tht. Ld. Ch., &amp; 2 L.O.’s give us formal opinion.

	Advice given 1903 by Finlay, when Att.G., tht. Forfeiture Act implied autom. disqualfn.  But some doubt wtr his opinion was soundly based.





		3.	Horror Comics.



Ll.G.	Public opinion is growing in favour of Govt. action.  Legn. will be v. diff.

	May I have authy. to prepare one, for considn.  Fear tht. I may be forestalled by Private Members’ Bill.  May I say tht. “legn. is being considered.”



J.S,.	Support this proposal.

							[Exit Att.G.



		4.	Redistribution of Seats.



Ll.G.	Some recommns. put fwd. explicitly because Commn. felt bound by principle of numerical equality.  When neither Party desires change, let us not make it.



P.M.	And on intervals betwn. reviews – say 15 vice 12 years as maximum.



H.C.	Parly. tactics.  Proposed 2 days next week.  Aim at general  	     	[Agreed

debate first, and then proceed to specific orders.  Do it on a motion taking note of the Reports.  But if it’s mainly to our advantage &amp; we are to say we don’t want such frequent reviews in future, will not Opposn. say “why do this one, now : why not have the amending legn. instead?”  Recognise, however, that some general statement is inevitable.



P.M.	Damp down : on general statement because legn. wd. be for next Parlt.





		5.	Sugar.



H.A.	Loss arises from large stocks bought to float de-rationing.  In fact consumption dropped after de-rationing – doubtless because of stores held by consumers.

	Ty. view : as stocks were increased to cushion consumer (from a shock which he didn’t feel) consumer shd. contribute twds. our loss.

	One price increase will operate on refiners, but they will pass it on.

	Means a 6% increase at time when world prices are dropping.



ALB.	Make it clear tht. this isn’t due to Comm. Sugar Agreemt.  It is due to purchase of Cuban sugar.



Sw.	In liquidating M/Mat. stocks, we avoided charging more than market price to dealers.  We followed the market down.  This is opposite policy.  Diff. to defend.



P.M.	And tea prices may rise still further.



D.H.A.	For next 3 months or so: then they may drop.

	Meat prices also are likely to be up in Jan/April.



P.M.	Better now than later.



R.A.B.	Economies needed for Budget.  We can’t do bread.  Sugar was deferred (retail price).  This (commercial price) we shd. certainly do : only involves .08 in c/living.



D.E.	Tate &amp; Lyle’s profits, recently declared, are v. large.  Can’t they be induced not to pass on the whole of this to consumer.

	They have shown increased profits &amp; dividends.



Ll.G.	Worth trying – they might respond.  They are concerned about their future.



P.M.     x|	Can’t the loss be covered, or reduced, by the figure at which you enter in the accounts the value of the portion assigned to stock-pile.



R.A.B	Workers can well afford the extra ½d. 



O.P.	Can’t we wait until o.a.p. increases are in operation.  And take the £3M. or so of loss involved by delay.



R.A.B.	Swinton economics are wasting away – teachers’ superannuation, bread etc.,

            y|	Can we not see what part Tate &amp; Lyle can carry?



H.M.    x|	Can’t you take the loss on this year’s Budget – to reduce surplus.



		Agreed :	R.A.B. to consider x and y.

				Report back to Cabinet.



							[Exit B-H.





		6.	Retired Pay of Public Servants.



R.A.B.	Grave diffies. if we start on this slippery slope.

	Hope Cab. will support me in resisting this.



W.M.  }	Support this view.

O.P.    }



H.M.	Agree we must w’stand this pressure.  Ty. shd. supply Ministers &amp; Central Office with stock reply?    (Agreed.)





		7.	Colonial Immigrants.



K.	You can’t have Ratcliffe.  He has bn. working on Income Tax for 2 yrs. and its time he did some judicial work.



A.L.B.	No suggn. of racial discrimination shd. be implied by t. of refs.



P.M.	Suggested amended t. of ref.



D.S.	Will Cttee. help?  Will there not be minority report?



Sal.	I am doubtful.  Also on composn. – shd. we have Party repves.?



A.L.B.	Cd. the Party groups be encouraged to give evidence, rather than have M.P.’s as members.



Ll.G.	Ready to follow that line.



A.L.B.	Wd. favour legn. if we cd. have it soon.  If we can’t, Cttee. wd. help to hold posn. m’while.  We ought to take some action, if only a Cttee. w’out delay.



O.P.	Favour early legn.



Ll.G.	What chance of legn. this Session?



H.M.	Left-wing might accept our decision, tho’ they wd. be reluctant to give evce. to a Cttee.



P.T.	Draft a Bill and see what it looks like.



		Cabinet Cttee. to prepare a scheme &amp; Bill.





		8.	Old Age Pensions.

P.M.	Welcome Ty. statement (Saty.) re recommn. to raise retiring age.



O.P.	Wd. wish, on 2nd. Rdg, to say definitely tht. we don’t accept this particular recommn. of Phillips Cttee.  It wdn’t work, in form recommended.

	Will seek R.A.B.’s agreement on wording.



H.C.	Somewhat precipitate.  Surely, we shd. have chance to consider Rpt.



R.A.B.	Cd. Cab. consider on Wedy.

	Agree tht. their particular plan is impracticable. But don’t exclude all possibility of raising retiring age.  

	Ty. statement was no more than : this report has not yet bn. considered by Govt.



P.M.	Cd. say in 2nd. Rdg that this is not part of Govt. scheme.



		9.	European Community : Coal and Steel.



D.S.	Since Cabt. discn., Council of Ministers have made diffies. over text of agreemt.  I am negotiating changes in text – thro’ Cab. Cttee. &amp; in consultn. with A.E.  May I go on, w’in principles agreed by Cabinet.

	Substance of change is only greater emphasis on mtgs with Council of  Ministers &amp; less on Authority.



P.M.	Let Cabt. know.



Sw.	D.S. can be trusted to safeguard Br. interests.
