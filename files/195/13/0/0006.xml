C.84(54)							8th December,	1954



		1.		Formosa.			[Enter Att.G



A.E.	Teeling M.P. going to SEA. &amp; proposing to stay with Chiang on Formosa.  He is unwilling to cancel, tho’ prepd. to curtail, his visit.

	Turton has failed to prevail on him.

	

P.M.	I will ask Ch. Whip to see him &amp;, if necessary, will write to him myself.





		2.	Soviet Union : Defectors.



A.E.	Deserter (Kuptsoff) killed sergt.who tried to stop him.  R. have asked for his return.  Awkward because R. are behaving well about return of B. soldiers. etc., who have gone over or bn. pinched for misconduct.



P.M.	Refugee shd. not be a murderer.  This is further than we shd. go.



A.E.	Will consult Ld. Chancellor &amp; Att.G.  But ours is not a good case.  Disposed to send him back.



Att.G.	Ct. of Appeal will shortly give judgemt. on 7 Poles wh. may have a bearing on violence in course of seeking refuge.



A.L.B.	Have R. ever returned a man who said he wanted to throw in his lot with R.



P.M.	Concerned to hear that 7 men fr. Manchr. Regt. shd. have deserted to R. Zone of Germany.  M/D. shd. enquire : to show our concern.





		3.	Duke of Windsor Papers.



P.M.	Read letter from D/W.  He says : initial mistake was failure of F.O. to make some statement at outset.  As to next vol., a bore that W’ton shd. insist on publn. : but will be ready with a dementi for issue as soon as the story breaks.

	Thus, it is clear that he is calm.



W.M.	He agrees tht. it’s better not to interfere with normal course of publn.



Sal.	But important that someone shd. at once put the right slant on it.



P.M.	Matter is to be watched at each stage.

	Cab. Secretariat to be responsible for warning Ministers.

			N.B. to warn Stationery Office.

								[Enter B.H.



		4.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Propose to announce Recess.  22/12 to 25/1 – provided tht. Govt. business is completed on Pensions Bill &amp; Boundary Commn. Orders.





		5.	Parliamentary Constituencies.



H.C.	Plan to w’draw some Orders.  Not sure it wd. be wise.  Think we must take the lot, on a package basis.  Our Party wd. prefer this.

	If any are w’drawn, we can’t prevent Members from airing grievances on the others.  Then controversy will break out all round.



B.H.	Agree.  But we shall know more to-night about Opposn. views.



J.S.	Have consulted Ll.G.  Members do expect us to take the lot.  Unless we have insuperable diffies., it is better to rest on recommns. as a whole.



O.P.	In 1948 we objected to any Govt. departures fr. the Rpt.



J.S.	Suggest L.P.S. shd. discuss with Ministers concerned. (Ll.G., J.S. &amp; B.H.)



A.E.	Strongly favour taking whole report w’out amendment.



		L.P.S.  Will discuss &amp; report to Cabinet again.





		6.	H/Commons Disqualification : Mr. Peter Baker.



K.	L.O.’s &amp; I have come, reluctantly, to concln. tht. conviction does not automatically vacate the seat.  Finlay was wrong in 1903.  H/C. must therefore pass a resolution.



H.C.	This means that Govt. must bring fwd. a motion.  Can he appear?



K.	He cd. come to the Bar : shd. be given opportunity.



Att.G.	Spker has ruled in earlier case tht. plea of guilty makes it unnecessary for Member to attend.



H.C.	If he doesn’t appeal, Att.G. B.H. &amp; I will carry out necessary procedure in consultn. with Speaker.

							[Exit B.H.

 

		7.	East/West Trade.	           [Enter B.C., S.Ll., J.T., Maudling.



P.T.	My proposals will be unpopular.  But they are only way to avoid continuing friction with U.S.  If we seek compromise, let us try to settle all together.

	Shipping suggns. are specially unpleasant.  But real choice is at end of memo.  And to stay as we are puts us in isolated dispute with U.S. – and imposes stiffer restns. on our export of fast ships than are accepted by other countries.



A.E.	Support this.  P.T.’s concln. is inescapable.

	This wd. restore our credit in Paris Group &amp; thus strengthen our posn. in argument with U.S.



J.T.	Much alarmed qua ship-bldg.  Tho’ busy now, future orders are falling off thro’ cancellations.

	Will cause political trouble – and affect Party in marginal seats at next Election.

	This will precipitate storm in H/C.



B.C.	Affects shipping cos., who sell old ships to R. in order to build new. Status quo is easier to defend.

	Leave shipping out of the deal.



J.S.	Support this qua emplt. in Scotland.



A.E.	R. haven’t placed one order for a new ship.



P.T.	New ships : no real business likely at present.  Posn. wd. be open to review in a years’ time.

	Second-hand ships.  More diff. posn., admittedly, but I think it cd. be held.

	If we are to settle, we must make some concession.

	Real issue is : not logic : but contd. quarrel with U.S.



H.A.	V. diff. to defend this to industry &amp; public.



A.L.B.	Cdn’t we exclude 2nd. hand ships?



P.T.	  (	20 yr. olds count for 50% only.  I cd. try to extend this.  But the more                               

              x (	I argue, the harder it will be to get settlement.

     (	R. have no inducement to order ships from U.K. – because Admy. 

     (	restrictns.

	Para 7 – 3rd. suggn.



W.M.	x ( wd. help qua employment.



A.E.	We are in a minority of one over all this.



H.M.	We must make some concession on shipping in order to get relief on copper &amp; rolling mills, where we are doing business.



P.T.	Concession on copper wd. give us much more pol. trouble : &amp; wd. not secure our objectives on shipping.

	Can’t defend this on detail – only as a package.



H.M.	Support package deal, with relief on 2nd. hand ships on lines of x(.



A.E.	Also provn. for review in a year’s time, before wh. ship-bldg. won’t be in actual diffy.



P.T.	 (	Ready to discuss para 7 3rd. suggn. with other Ministers &amp; go hard

             y (	(for concession on that, as part of package.

    (

J.T.          (	And I will consider again Admyy. restns. in excess of COCOM rules.



P.T. 	Let us put revised plan to U.S.



P.M.	Shd. we accept equality with Europe in shipping orders : when we still have 38% of world ship-bldg.



P.T.	Only for one year – and review then.  That wd. be made clear.



H.M.	It is academic for 12 months.  Real need for us is on 2nd. hand ships.



P.T.	If my package deal is rejected, I wd. try to get agreement on copper &amp; rolling mills.  And prs. Admy. &amp; M/T. will consider what our policy shd. be on ships.



Sw.	That will get us worst of all worlds.  Sacrifice the trade we can do because of academic point on ship-bldg.



H.M.	Make it clear tht. we cd. not accept principle of equality except for one year.



P.T.	Will submit formula – on 3. and y. – tel. to W’ton.

	M’while will say what is proposed in memo. on copper in Paris group on Friday.

							[Enter G.Ll.



		8.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	N.U.R. made agreemt. wh. operated fr. Oct./Nov. (?)  Later an award gave them differential higher than B.T.C. liked.  Discussing consequentials.  NUR. have now repudiated Oct. agreement.  B.T.C. have promised expedition in talks.  N.U.R. have asked to see Minister.  To Press they claim part of war-time profits.



	M/T. is to see NUR. Mon.  Suggest he reminds them B.T.C. are ready to deal quickly with new claim.  They will say it’s waste of time because BTC have said they can’t afford much.  Suggest M/T. also says Govt. can’t give subsidy.  To do this, in order to buy off a strike, wd. have repercussions at once – on buses, mines etc.,  We can’t desert principle tht. you can’t get out of an industry in wages more than it can afford to pay.

	If NUR. resume talks, we shall want to know generally what B.T.C. will do.  Unusual.  But otherwise we may get into threat of strike w’out knowledge &amp; room to manoeuvre.

	Hope he may be ready to offer talks with a view to enabling more to be earned.  There is much redundancy.  Public will want to see efficiency under consn. as well as wages.

	Serious economic (&amp; political) consequences of a rlway strike.

	Asked T.U.C. on subsidy point.  Deakin agrees with me : he is consultg. others &amp; will tell me what they think.

	If there is trouble, it will come soon.  Must be able to consult.  But constant Cab. mtgs. on this subject will stiffen strikers’ demands.



B.C.	N.U.R. will say on Mon. tht. B.T.C. have told them they can’t afford the sort of award they want.  They will therefore ask in effect for subsidy.  If I hold out no hope of that, they may strike.  Welcome therefore suggn. of Cab. Cttee. which can meet quickly.

	B.T.C. are prepared to go a little way.



W.M.	Helpful if M/T. cd. indicate this to  N.U.R.



P.M.	Effect of a rlway strike on coal.



W.M.	One thing cd. be done – B.T.C. being ready to go further into the red.



B.C.	His scheme of modernisation is nearly complete.  He will want financial help on that.  If that were assured, he might be readier to accept running loss m’while.



M.	M’while, hope Cab. will stand firm on subsidy because of repercussions throughout natd. industries.



Sw.	B.T.C. cd. expect guidance on size of deficit he shd. run.



P.T.	Under threat of strike?



Sw.	No harm in a private understanding.



H.M.	Rlways are not a sound business, financially.  Wages are v. low.  We shall have to face this.

	On other hand, they use too much labour &amp; are inefficient.

	Cd. B.T.C. not make a bargain with N.U.R.  for efficiency in return for sound wages.  This is the moment, when full emplt. ensures that men can find another job.

	Even if N.U.R. refused such an offer, it wd. be a better issue to strike on.
