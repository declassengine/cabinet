C.5(55)								20th January, 1955



									[Enter B-H., H.H.

		1.	Kenya.



H.H.	Govr’s mtg. with loyalists went well.  No results yet.  Indian &amp; African members of legve. Council have accepted terms.  White Opposn. have criticised them.  May be oppn. organised in Nairobi.  U.K. Press is favourable.



P.M.	Why weren’t we told Att.G. was being moved off?  It was relevant.



H.H.	Don’t know.  He hasn’t got on well with Blundell etc.





	2.	Coloured Immigrants.



P.M.	Need for decision before long.



A.E.	Before Commonwealth P.M. mtg.



H.H.	Osborne M.P. is thinking of introducg. Bill under 10 min. rule.



Ll.G.	Depn. y’day from B’ham.  No objn. to them as workers.  But qua housing.  Figures are impressive.



Sw.	Might consider Cttee. on social aspects, alone.



A.E.	Might be useful – to re-inforce action we decide to take.



P.M.	Not in favour.  Better to introduce Bill.  May find we cd. get it thro’.  At least we shd. have shown our view.



Sal.	Urgent.



H.H.	Movement is starting now in favour of immign. from Barbados.





									[Exit H.H.

	3.	Foreign Affairs.



A.E.	a)	Kutsov.  We have decided we can’t hand him back.  No case in law for doing so.						Agreed.



	b)	Thermo-nuclear weapons.



A.E.	Chinese prob. don’t know.  Will be giving informn. on effects to P.M.M.  See how Nehru takes it : consider wtr we shd. ask him to tell Chinese.



Sw.	So long as we don’t mind his coupling it with his view tht. no more experiments be made.



A.E.	Shd. want to tell Dulles first.



P.M.	Yes : it’s mainly a U.S. problem.

		Review this again after P.M.M.



	c).	European Arms Pool.



A.E.	French plan has many supra-natl. features &amp; is impractical.  None of others will accept it.  They wd. however, accept our practical suggns. for standardisation.  Propose, at right moment, to put our plan fwd. – after Fr. proposals have had a run.



	d).	Formosa.



A.E.	W’ton telegram 142-3.

	Two ques 	i)	shd Oracle now be launched?

			ii)	guarantee (U.S.) of Quemoy

	Worried about ii).  Q. is nearer to m’land than Tachen Islands : has never bn. claimed as part of Formosa – or not part of China.

	Suggest we put these diffies. to U.S.  Ask wtr we shd. not see what we can get ouf of (i) before touching (ii)?  Read draft of telegram to W’ton urging i) before ii) is attempted.



P.M.	Agree with this view.



A.E.	They have asked our views.  We shd. tell them what we think.



P.M.	Tho’, if they went ahead on (ii), we might have to give them moral support.



									[Enter H.B

	4.	Foreign Service : Report of Estimates Committee.



A.E.	I said in H/C we wd. reply to House.  For this reason, and because new Cttee. has not bn. apptd., I want reply to be given by White Paper.



H.B.	Disadvantages of that : may be regarded as precedent : more likely to provoke a debate.



R.A.B.	I prefer a White Paper.					Agreed.



A.E.	Hope for early report.



H.B.	As quickly as possible.



A.E.	Aim at 31/1.



P.M.	What of H/C.  Cttees. going overseas?



H.B.	Shd. my Cttee. go into that?  Ready to do so.



P.M.	Surely we shd. stand firm against it.  Is there any doubt?  M.P.’s are not peripatetic inspectors.



H.B.	Reasoned reply will be needed.  Their suggn. is not limited to that of Cttee. going abroad.



A.E.	Separate this from Foreign Service issue.



R.A.B.	to consider answer to that, with AE &amp; H.M. &amp; L.P.S.



O.P.		Cd. ignore it in White Paper.



							[Exit H.B.

							[Enter S.Ll., H.W., G.Ll., B.C.

		5.	Railways.



P.M.	Advise caution.  R.A.B. is surprisingly sympathetic.  Rlways may not be on up-tide.  Roads &amp; air = transport of future.  Coal transport may drop off in future years.

		Can’t evade 1st. priority of exp’re. on roads.



R.A.B.	I have had this in mind for 2 years – not connected with recent dispute.  No investmt. in rlways for years past.  Investment in gas, coal, electricity, has bn. such tht. this is not out of scale.  

This plan doesn’t alarm me qua scale.  We shd. certainly examine its merits &amp; details.

	There wd. be no diffy. in raising this sum on market.  No Budget money.  

£400 M. wd. be needed anyway, for normal m’tenance.  E.P.C. have discussed it.  May be criticised because doesn’t deal with labour efficiency.

	Let B.T.C. publish it &amp; allow public opinion to play on.



P.M.	Yes – let it also be available in Vote Office.



L.P.	We shall be asked if we approve it.  Shd. we not wait until we know more about investment in roads.  £60 M. on roads was said to be intolerable : this is £58 M for rlways.  And what is relation betwn. the 2.



B.C.	There is room for this rlway plan, however large the exp’re. on roads.



L.P.	But won’t it be affected by changes in road system.



B.C.	No.  This is needed for tonnage carried by rail.



L.P.	Plan depends on co-opn. of N.U.R.  Do we approve it before we have that promise.



B.C.	As soon as publn. is appd., B.T.C. will at once discuss with Unions.



A.E.	Am impressed by case made in Plan.

	Pity tht. public will be captured by £1200 M. figure.  Shd. make it clear tht. £800 M. is total of new investment.

	Atomic power : relieved to see para. 36. wh. indicates tht. this increases need for electrificn. of rlways

	Modernn. of coal-mining has given us less large coal.  That strengthens case for electrificn. &amp; diesel

	Enquiry into man-power on rlways Shd. be apptd. by B.T.C., not by Govt.  It is their job.  Give them first go at it.

	This plan will make heavy demands on our export industries.  Shan’t we have to be careful over that?



H.W.	Ct of Inquiry.  Final report will be circulated to Cab. as soon as recd.  Bound to refer to need for greater efficiency.  Will be helpful.  Shd. also gloss para. 10 of Interim Rpt.

	Normal to invite views of parties on report.  Propose to do that.



B.C.	Inquiry into man-power.  B.T.C. wd. be ready to appoint.

	£600 M (not £400 M) wd. be needed for normal m’tenance.  

On industrial load, there has bn. consultn. with industry – who wd. welcome these orders as basis for export trade.



S.Ll.	It wd. be w’in our capacity to carry out this Plan.  Propose standing Cttee. – B.T.C. &amp; engineering industry – to spread orders etc.,



D.E.	Wd. enquiry be helpful in getting men behind modernisn. plan?  Latter is more important.



H.M.	Distinguish betwn. complaints of redundancy &amp; proper way of manning new rlway system.

	This plan wd. help nation &amp; Party.

	We, as Govt., are under-writing this loan.  When Plan is published, many ques will be asked.  E.g. estimated savings, in exp’re, in manpower, technical points.  We shd. know tht. B.T.C. can answer these.  Must therefore be discns. with them on details.

Don’t accept Plan as it stands.  But don’t pour cold water on it.

This is a big opportunity.  Socialists made a mess of natn.  It wd. be nice if Tories cd. rescue it.  Mght be a group of Ministers to ensure this is put to best advantage in Parlt. &amp; in country.



Sw.		Unions must be carried fwd. on this.

		But is management sound.

	Cd. we have enquiry – one independent, 2 from B.T.C., 2 fr. Unions – to check up on details of Plan &amp; means of implementing it.  Otherwise shall we secure their good-will to give up restrictive practices.



P.T.		Shd. Cab. not see Final Rpt. before it is referred to parties?



			Agreed : Meet Monday 4.30.p.m. to consider Final Rpt.



B.H.		Can drop Borrowing Powers Bill from Tuesday.

		Early offer of debate.

									[Exit B.H., G.Ll.

									[Enter J.T.

		6.	East-West Trade.



P.T.		As in memo.



A.E.	Worried about effect on U.S., esp. on shipping. Because they give us no concession on rolling mills or copper, shd. we insist on bldg. fast ships?  There isn’t much we shall build.  

Wd. prefer to meet U.S. on shipping &amp; go on with rolling mills.



P.T.	We cdn’t defend in U.K. acceptance of shipping proposal in COCOM.  The only ques is wtr we shd. unilaterally refuse to export fast ships, even tho’ others sell them.  No need for statement on that.  But if, in future, others do it we shd. be free to do it ourselves.



J.T.	Naval staff willing to free it up to 16 knots.  Cdn’t agree to go above that just because Denmark are allowed to do it.



A.E.	Cdn’t we propose freedom for all ships below 15½ knots.



P.T.	U.S. wdn’t have that.  We can only continue with status quo – under which there is freedom up to 12 knots.

	End of para 5.  Seek agreemt. to closer control on matters other than speed.



H.M.	Speed is more dangerous that volume.  Wish we cd. persuade U.S. of this.



A.E.	Give U.S. our decn. on commns. before we announce our posn. on wire in COCOM.							Agreed.



[S.Ll.	Diff. to hold up orders



H.M.	Do it at once.]



A.E.	There will be trouble with U.S. over shipping.





					[Exit S.Ll., J.T.







7.	Equal Pay.



R.A.B.	Have negotiated scheme, to spread over 7 years.  Will cost £1¾ M. in 1st. year.  

Will announce as soon as H/C meets.



D.E.		What do I say to teachers?  



R.A.B.  	Go to Burnham Ctee.



R.A.B.		Will be restricted to non-industrials.



									[Exit B.C.

		8.	Price of Sugar.



P.M.		This will be v. unpopular.



A.E.		But quite inevitable.



H.A.		Wd. be announced at end/Jan. &amp; wd. come into effect twds end/Feb.



R.A.B.	Gives substantial Exchequer saving, with v. little effect on c/living index.



H.W.	C/living index is higher than it has ever bn., &amp; no sign of its coming down.



R.A.B.		We held in steady for over a year.  And it rose because of freeing meat.



W.		If it must be, do it soon.



RAB.		Sugar Bd. wd. do it later if we don’t do it now.



			Memo. approved.





		9.	Ireland.



Sw.	After Omagh raid I made repns. to Cosgrave, who was here.

	Soon after Boland told me his Govt. was going to take drastic action v. I.R.A.

	Nothing happened.  Boland now says his Govt. have got cold feet &amp; are not going to do it.

	Result will be to encourage I.R.A. to greater aggression &amp; more trouble on the border.



A.E.	I saw Cosgrave at that time.  He spoke of Ireland coming into W. European Union.  I suggd. N.A.T.O. – he cdn’t do that because of need to “respect frontiers”.

	We have heard no more.
