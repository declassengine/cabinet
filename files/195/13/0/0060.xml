CLOSED UNDER THE

	System is as safe as it can be made.

P.M.

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





		5.	South Africa : Defence Talks.



S.Ll.	Mtg. E. at 3. p.m.

	Def. Cttee. considered drafts yesterday.

	a) Simonstown Agreement.

	Para 9. – accepted.

	Finance.



R.A.B.	Accept £750.000.  You won’t get more.  But define precisely what it covers.  Agreed.

	Date.  They accept 21 months.  Para 17 : wording needs adjustment.



P.M.	Hope Annex B. will be publd.



S.Ll.	Better terms than in some other dockyards.  May provoke demands fr. others.



P.M.	Must risk that.



P.M.	Annex C.  Last sentence.  Who will work out details.

	Para.2(iv). admission at end is damaging.  Try for less obj. wording.



P.M.	Paras 6 &amp; 8.  Cdn’t phrases at x be made more firm.  “It is intended” e.g. in para. 6.  And omit “do their best to” in (viii).  Try both.



	b) Naval Agreement.



P.M.	Flag Offr. i/c S. Afr. Area.  Will be under C-in-C.?  



J.T. 	Yes, in war.  In peace, he is only a planning officer.



D.S.	Para 11.  Doesn’t commit Union Govt. to commit their forces to this command.



S.Ll.	Clear fr. text as a whole. cf. para. 7.  And their intention has bn. made clear in discns.



	c) Defence of S. Africa.



S.Ll.	Propose to begin with para 3.  Omit 1.  Follow on 2, 4 etc.,

	But, if he won’t agree, we will ask for “Africa, incldg. S. “Africa”.

	

R.	F.O. wd. prefer to do Simonstown, &amp; Naval, &amp; keep back c) and d).

	Because we haven’t got a firm commitment to M/E. defence.  We are lagging in discns. with U.S. on M/E, and haven’t much now to offer to S.A.  Later, we mght have more to offer &amp; mght be able to get them (S.A.) committed to M/E.



S.Ll.	They may dislike some parts of (c).

	But CIGS attaches gt. importce. to (d).  Believes we can make real practical progress.  We may lose the chance if we delay.



H.	Para. 10 mght lead to Afr. D. Organn. w’out commitment to M/E.

	But I want d).  Cd. we get some public admission of staff talks, in a preamble or in Press communiqué.  Believe we cd. press them for that.

	One final snag.  Agreemts a) &amp; b) will have to be regd. with U.N.

	S.A. won’t like that because enabling U.N. to poke noses into it.



P.M.	Pure formality.



S.Ll.	They needn’t register it.  We can do so, alone.  May get out of it on tht basis.



R.	Before publn. can we inform interested States in M/E. &amp; Africa.	}

										}Agreed

A.L.B.	And we wd. want to do same for Col. African Govts.		}



S.Ll.	Time-table.  E. wants to leave at end/week.  Haven’t asked him yet wtr he will accept announcemt. before he leaves.



P.M.	Advantage in announcg. before he leaves.

	But don’t make any announcemt. before full text is available.

	Keep him until it can come out in full.

	Aim at statement on Monday.

								[Exit J.T.

	Immedte. opn. : authority to evacuate Fort, if expedient.  But Govr. has bn. asked for his view on expediency.



A.L.B.	I have asked Govr. to consider wtr it wd. not be better to destroy Fort.

Shall then be asked where our Bill is.  Can I say “will be introduced shortly”?  Want to clear with Opposn. the project of procdg. tho’ don’t want to wait upon detailed comment before introdn.

	There is also ques of 2 Sinn Fein M.P.’s.  S. Tyrone defeated candidate has proceeded by petition, invitg N.I. Ct. to declare S. Fein man disqualified &amp; other elected.  The other constituency has not proceeded in this way : &amp; this means Govt. must act.  First motion to establish fact tht. he is in gaol, fr. Ulster High Ct : then resoln. tht. he is disqualified : then motion for new writ : then By-Election, in which same man might be elected again!!



S.	McInnes (Soc.) may also be disqualified, as Director of Estate Co.



Att.G.	I haven’t had the facts.  I shd. prefer to be able to make statement about both.  



H.C. 	Must make statement on George at 3p.m. to-day.

Agric. Welfare : hope to get introdn. just before Recess – not 2nd. Rdg.



P.T.	Inventions &amp; Designs.  Don’t want to do this early.

		10.	Cyprus.						



P.M.	Wanted to avoid appearance of admission tht. Greece had right to be consulted on sovereignty.  But wanted a talk – because wd. show T. &amp; G. divided on issue of self-determination.  Wd. help us to go on with our own ideas.  Wd. also help us if Gks. declined invitn.
