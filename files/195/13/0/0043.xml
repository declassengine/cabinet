S.Ll.	Tribute to A.E.





		2.	Industrial Disputes : Newspapers.



W.M.	Changes in form of negotiating machinery might be basis of getting back to work.  NPA wdn’t couple that with any promise of more wages.

	Union’s mght take it w’out such promise.

	Ct. of Enquiry shd. finish work to-day.

	Likely to come to a head over week-end.





		3.	Cotton Industry.

P.T.	Statement on G.A.T.T. &amp; on Japan will have to be made on 20/4.



P.M.	My makg. it may make it worse for India : that must he considered.



P.T.	I mght be better able to answer supplementaries.



		Agreed : Make statement on 20/4.

			   P.M. to consider who shd. make it.

C.M.2(55)							12th April, 1955



		1.	Northern Ireland : Unemployment.	[Enter de L’l., R.M.



Ll.G.	Discns. have bn. procdg., both Govts., for some time.  That is known &amp; results are expected.  Awkward therefore tht. cut in Swifts shd. cause addl. unemplt. of 1.300 at Shortt’s.  M/S. have suggd. putting in another 10 Canberras, which we shd. have to under-write.



R.M.	Betwn. now and end/year, there will be a gap – before Britannia’s come in.  This wd. employ 600 in the interval.

	Some risk tht. India won’t buy the Canberras – but v. small one.



S.Ll.	Other methods explored : but this is most practical.  Canberras are useful aircraft.



de L’l.	189 on order for R.A.F.  Cd. M/S. transfer some of those to N.I.?

	Cdn’t guarantee to use another 10 in front line.



R.A.B.	Not a sound propn.  RAF don’t need : India mightn’t buy.

	N.I. Govt. aren’t showg. enough drive to get new industry.

	Am already under-writing Britannia’s.  Reluctant to do this.

	Ready to consider subsidy for prodn.



A.L.B.	We moved Shortt’s to N.I. – a Govt. factory.  Diff. to m’tain tht. we shdn’t use it as means of providing emplt.



D.S.	Support that view.  Gt. blow to N.I. to see collapse of aircraft industry, hit by Comet as well as Swift.

	Cdn’t we do this &amp; press at same time for more N.I. effort to attract light industry.



P.T.	They do provide more incentives than we do in developmt. areas.



D.S.	But personalities are lacking.



H.A.	Fact of Govt. ownership of factory is v. important factor.



R.A.B.	Let me discuss with Ministers concerned (M/D., M/S.) in consultn. with H.O. chances of getting orders for these Canberras.



							[Exit R.M. &amp; de L’l.





		2.	European Defence.



H.M.	Fr. are holding back on ratificn. of Agreemts. in order to get all decns. firm on Saar.  Trying to work to NATO Mtg in May at which G. sovereignty can be affirmed – &amp; we can go on to discuss Four-Power Mtg prepns.  Aim to get definite time-table.



		3.	Formosa.



H.M.	Complicated by Menzies plan – evacn. of off-shore islands coupled with guarantee of Formosa.  He is pressing for our views by to-morrow, so tht. he can go on with Dulles.  Canada dislikes this : we must think it over v. fully.  Draft tels. prepared setting out diffies. &amp; suggesting refce. to all Doms.

	Guarantee is not appropte.  U.S. don’t want our physical support only our moral backing.  Also R. may be driven to take a posn. despite their (probable) anxieties.

	We cd. stand pat.  Then, if off-shore islands are attacked, what do we do?  Our aim must be to get the islands evacuated.



H.M.	It wd. be guarantee to Chiang, in form.  Not therefore open to above objn.  But unpalatable politically.

	Read draft telegrams.

	Alternatives 	i)  no action – risking attack.

			ii) seek means of securing evacuation of islands, otherwise than by guarantee of F.  A possible plan wd. be to suggest tht. Four Power Mtg shd. consider procedures for discn. of F. issue : after interim decln. to go to U.N. if F. attacked after evacn.



P.M.	I support this initiative.  Suggest it be taken w’out adding tht. Cab. haven’t considered.



H.	Wd. like to be consulted on timing of approach to N.Z. and Canada.



H.M.	Ready to allow interval.  Also make it clear we shan’t divulge his conversns. with Dulles, but shall hang it on Press suggns. of a declaration.



		Approved, subject to x/.





		4.	Industrial Disputes – Newspapers.



W.M.	Point wh. emerges from Rpt. is tht. N.P.A. don’t discuss claims of these Unions, their real negotiations being with printers’ unions.

	Ct. will say tht., this claim is unrealistic, machinery is defective.

	Will suggest discns. on that.  And that will be accepted by NPA and T.U.C.  Ques is wtr striking unions will find it enough of a face-saver.

	If nothing emerges, it will be long struggle.  N.P.A. will have to consider what to do.  Provincials cdn’t. expand to cover main need.  But N.P.A. mght themselves produce an emergency paper.

          x/	Can’t ask N.P.A. to make concession.



		General support for x/.

							[Enter B.H.





		5.	Cotton Industry.



P.T.	Restn. on Comm. imports wd. be a serious move.

	About 50,000 men on extended holiday.  Some will come back.  Likely to be continuing short-time working.

	Confined to India, it won’t satisfy cotton industry.

	Shall be pressed to go beyond cotton – &amp; we may be forced into posn. in wh. we are treating India as foreign country.  We have a lot to lose on U.K. exports, generally.

	Solution wh. appeals to me is to remove p. tax.  Announce our plan to retain right to keep J. cotton out.  Make what we can of India’s redn. of her duties on our textile imports into India.

	What cd. Ty. do to help industry to switch over to higher grades?



H.	Might increase our exports from 3½ m. to 13 m. yards.



P.T.	60-80% duty in India is one of Lancs. complaints.  Looks as tho’ India may reduce it, at best, to 20-30%.

	This increase in our exports wd. be useful &amp; wd. remove one cause of complaint.  But wdn’t pretend tht. this wd. satisfy Lancs.



R.A.B.	Tel. fr. India is new factor.  Hard to announce next week tht. we intend to put on holding quota at this moment, when we have chance of getting another £10 M. of exports to India.

	

	Suggest we send message to Govt./India asking what they intend.  Defer any statement m’while.



P.T.	What do we do if India does give us this benefit.  Hard then to act v. India.



P.M.	Agree with R.A.B.’s view.

	Think what India’s comment wd. be.

	Tell Parlt. we (Govt.) are in commn. with Indian Govt.



R.A.B.	Yes : read draft message.  Ques is how far do we threaten quota on gray cloth.							[Exit J.S.



H.A.	But put in scale the fact tht. increase in our exports is in line with our policy &amp; restricting imports is against it.



P.T.	May I agree with RAB terms of a holding statement in H/C.



P.M.	I wd. say no more at this stage than tht. we are in consultn. with G/India.



R.A.B.	[After discn. on P.Tax.]

	Believe we shall have to move towards freedom to impose tariff on Commonwealth goods.  That was why I was ready to accept holding quota.
