C.2(55)								6th January, 1955



							[Enter S.Ll., B-C., G.Ll.,Att.G.



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.		Series of mtgs. with N.U.R.

Told them Govt. accept. recommns. (for action) in rept. as basis for resumg. negotns. – not necessarily all its arguments.

Main points (5) enumerated : all accepted by B.T.C. (on staty. oblign. they accept concln. for this negotn. tho’ not argument leading up to it). 

These condl. on last 2 viz., no promise of concession before negotns. begin : &amp; w’drawal of strike notices.

Urged them therefore to call off strike &amp; resume negotns.  Warned them tht. Govt. wd. have to act to-morrow, to prepare to meet threat to life of nation.

Ended by inviting both sides to meet me this p.m.

Campbell said he wasn’t askg. for figures but only assurance tht. somethg. worth while wd. emerge.  I referred him to concln. 5.  He hoped B.T.C. wd. be “less rigid”.

Clear now that something will have to be paid.  Not therefore worth a strike.



R.A.B.		No Govt. shd. condone negotns. under threat of [imminent] strike.

But, if notices w’drawn, there is hope of settlement.

		N.U.R. shd. know tht. Govt. are determined to act.



A.E.	Consequences for future are v. grave.  Times &amp; M. Gardian.  Don’t want strike as well.  NUR shd. know clearly tht., if they don’t w’draw notices, we shall stand firm.



W.M.		Agree.  Not enough to “suspend” notice.  They shd. w’draw notices.



A.E.	M/L. shd. this p.m. say with Govt. authy. tht. no negotn. w’out w’drawal of notices &amp; that, if not w’drawn, decln. of emergency will be made to-morrow.



P.T.	Will Govt. make any public statement of their view before emergency is proclaimed?



W.M.	My statement to N.U.R. this a.m. can be released later to-day.



P.M.	Shd. be carefully considered statement.



W.M.	Is there time for that?  They make statement to Press as soon as they leave.  I must be able to say what line I took in talks.



A.E.	Man-power – nothing on that in Rpt.  Do we get that?



P.M.	[They shd. be told tht., if they strike, all bets are off.]



W.M.	Interim report.  And both sides argued before Ct. there was not much in redundancy.  But Ct. will cover it in final report, due by end of next week.



A.E.	Are we taking enough care of future?  Dropping reins on horses’ neck.  Effects on other natd. industries of “principle” suggested in interim report.



W.M.	I have not said more than tht. we accept it’s recommns. for action as basis for dealing with this dispute at this stage.



A.E.	Para. 10 is new doctrine never approved by Parlt.



H.M.	If NUR are to be persuaded to call off strike, B.T.C. must indicate that in negotiation they will make a substantial offer.



B.C.	B.T.C. are now trying to draft somethg. with this in view.



S.Ll.	Unconditional – or tied up with some assurance on man-power efficiency.



H.M.	No conditions to-day.  Later : e.g. in connn. with modernisation plans.



Sal.	Or, earlier, on final report.  Hope we reserve opportunity to introduce condns. then.



W.M.	I am not negotiating.  B.T.C. will negotiate thereafter &amp; before they finish they will have the final report.



W.	Don’t insist on w’draw vice suspend strike action.  

	Remember Campbell’s posn. vis-à-vis his extremists.



W.M.	Think I can persuade them to w’draw.  Want to carry out this part of Court’s report.



Att.G.	In any Govt. statement we shd. make it clear tht. B.T.C. are not relieved of oblign. under s. 3(4) of Act, tho’ they don’t interpret it narrowly.



A.E.	No need for Govt. statement if parties agree to resume negotns.



	

Preparation for Emergency.



Ll.G.	Proclamation of Emergency, Frid.  Regns. to be laid as soon as may be thereafter.

	Arrangements for m’taining essential services are in hand.
