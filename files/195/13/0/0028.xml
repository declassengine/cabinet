C.14(55)							16th February 1955



		1.	Parliament.			[Enter Reading, N.B., B.H.



H.C.		Business for next week.



		

2.	New Colonial Office Building.



P.M .	Cttee. to consider site for new C.O. H.Q. e.g. in Richmond Terrace?

	

N.B.	What is Govt. view on greater Parlt. Square?  I have no power to stop Ch. Surveyors from re-building.



D.S.	They cd. be persuaded to delay, on basis of a plan for greater Parlt. Square.



N.B.	I doubt it : their bldg. is too small : if we prevented them fr. going ahead, they wd. have to be compensated.



P.M.	Don’t want Tory Govt. to ruin this sacred ground, by an inharmonious structure.



H.C.	It isn’t a bad bldg.



A.L.B.	Even if Ch. Surveyors were persuaded not to re-build, what of the other bldgs which have long future.  Merely leaving W’minster site wd. make Square more unsightly.



Sal.	Cost?  



N.B.	£4½ -£5 M.



D.S.  	But not for years.  All we need do now is to announce project &amp; do nothing inconsistent with it.  The £5 M. wd. be spread over many years.



P.M.	For C.O., a H.Q. wd. suffice – with subordinate staff elsewhere.



D.E.	Efficiency demands the opposite : concentn. of Dpts. into single bldgs.  Saves money and increases efficiency.  F.O. are in 13 bldgs.  Administrative nonsense.  No outside organn. wd. do this. 

	Moreover, leases on subsidiary bldgs are expiring.  Unless we build new offices, cost will increase largely.



A.L.B.	Costs of dispersal are considerable.



O.P.	In a greater Parlt. Square, proper site for C.O. wd. be in Rooney’s Bar block.



R.A.B.	i) Not prepd. to spend money now on greater Parlt. Square.

	ii) Is it worth keeping that possibility open?  It may be.

	iii) Cd. we therefore find alternative site for C.O.  If so, keep (i) open.  If not, then go on – and put (i) out of a/c.



P.M.	Accept that.  Let’s have Cttee. on (iii).



N.B.	That will involve announcg. Parlt. Square plan.  And legn. to validate holdg.  W’minster Hosp. site as open space.



H.M.	Cd. tell Ch. Surveyors in confidence &amp; ask them to wait while we consider ques.



A.L.B.	Only other practicable site is Richmond Terrace.  May that be considered quickly.



		Agreed :	M/Works to submit proposals on basis of

				bldg. new C.O. in Richmond Terrace.



							[Exit N.B.





		3.	Review of G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Nothing in this memo. wh. affects Lancs.  Her immedte. problems arise fr. Japan, wh. we are keeping out of G.A.T.T. and India, wh. falls to be dealt with under our separate agreemt.

	G.A.T.T. isn’t B/T. exclusive affair.  It is central to our external econ. policy and econ. relns. with U.S.  It is greatly in U.K. interest to have stab. in tariffs, restn. of quotas., broad agreemt. with Doms &amp; U.S.  It suits us to stay in.  Negotns. have bn. supervised by Min. Cttee.  My policy has therefore bn. supported by colleagues : &amp; I am commd. to it by speeches to Parlt. &amp; Party.

	Of outstanding ques, first is protection for Colonial products.  But most political : will reserve it until A.E. arrives.

	Quotas.  We can use them in b/p diffies. &amp; can discrim. in favour of Comm.  After convertibility, we cd. use b/p. quotas but not discriminatory.  In interim, small field in wh. Europe (incldg U.K.) cd. use protective quotas up to 1959.  Shd. we then want power to discriminate?  We have asked for it.  But Doms. now say they don’t want it.  For public defence of GATT, we need to say Comm. is with us.  Therefore I propose we don’t ask for discrimination – &amp; defend tht. on basis Doms. didn’t want it.



R.A.B.	I think we shd. keep the power.	i) O.E.EC. wd. be upset if we didn’t seek it : for they want it &amp; it wd. be awkward to justify it.  Keep in step with Europe : &amp; seek Austr. support for it.

						ii)  Home politics.  E.g. crawler tractors.

						iii) Doms.  With non-discrimn. we cdn’t favour Commonwealth &amp; shd. appear to be giving up Preference.

	I wd. therefore risk opposing Canada &amp; S. Africa &amp; try for discrimn. power.



Sw.	I started in favour of this.  We can’t discriminate in favour of Canada, save by a trick.  Can’t take posn. in Parlt. on G.A.T.T. on wh. we haven’t Dom. support.  Canada is supremely important because expandg. market : bad to fly in their face.  With poss. exceptn. of N.Z., all Doms. think non-discr. wd. suit them. 

	Goods of interest to them wd. be excluded fr. Europe by quotas – e.g. Germany wd. agree with L. America to exchange wheat for manufacturers.

	Our right course, qua Doms. &amp; home politics, is to say we wd. have favoured discr. to help you : but if you will say at Geneva tht. non-discr. suits you best, we will support.



A.L.B.	Qua Colonies, I share R.A.B.’s view.  If we don’t get a Colonial waiver I shd. want to retain discr. power.

	Anxious about a phrase in para. 7 wh. refers to protective quotas.



P.T.	Arguments are nicely balanced. But in fact Europe hasn’t yet asked for discr. power.  Don’t want to whip up Eur. v. Doms.  But, if Eur. does ask for it, there wd. be a new position.



R.A.B.	European Delegates at Geneva are not takg. so stiff a line as their Govts did in OEEC.



P.T.	In reply to A.L.B., this doesn’t apply anyway to new protective quotas – only to existing ones.



		Propose : 	No new initiative to seek discr. power. Let it go, 

on non-discr. basis, unless Europeans raise it.



R.A.B.	Doesn’t get over our domestic pol. diffy.  Wd. be easier to defend this on basis tht. we had discrim. power, or tried to get it, – even tho’ Doms. don’t support it.  Austr. will support us.

	Make a further attempt at Geneva, in co-opn. with Europeans.



P.T.	Don’t like lining up with Europe v. Doms. – esp. when Canada has bn. so v. helpful.

	After discn. : I’m ready , if Cab. wish, to try for this.  But Eur. will jump at this, &amp; we shall be lined up with Eur. v. Commonwealth.



Sw.	Don’t do it that way.  If we must have it, let me try to explain our need to Doms.



P.T.	Eur. hasn’t asked for it.  If she doesn’t, no diffy.  If she does, we must consider posn. again.  This applies only in interval (v.short) betwn. end of b/p. and 1959.



K.	Easy to rely on argument tht. we continue for a time what we do now.



R.A.B.  	{Agree to P.TT.’s formula – so long as I can tell (but not incite)  

Agreed	{O.E.E.C. &amp; delete last 2 lines of para.3(ii) &amp; insert words referring

	{to need for some flexibility in new quotas.



A.E.	Looking at our national posn. : our expanded exports are due mainly to trade with Can., A., N.Z. &amp; India.  Those countries cd. switch to Eur. as source of supply.  Will this encourage such a switch?



P.T.	A. fear bi-lateral bargains e.g. fr-Germany – to force her exports into A., if there is power to discriminate.



	Colonies.



ALB.	GATT &amp; Ottawa together give us no room for manoeuvre.  Preferences are still valued by Colonies.  Tory Party hasn’t changed its beliefs on preference.  Original clause we put fwd. at Geneva wd. have given us power to help Colonies.  Now seems it won’t be accepted.  But wdn’t it be better to be defeated on it at Geneva before we go over to a second-best?  Wd. be easier to defend in Parlt.  Tories will be furious at “tailoring G.A.T.T. to suit U.S. needs”.  Shdn’t we try to get no new pref. rule dropped for Colonies.



P.T.	We seek freedom to give some help to Colonies.  At present, it is tobacco, citrus fruits &amp; bananas.  Col. repves. in Geneva are now negotiatg. waiver tht. wd. give i) power to treat  Col. industry for various purposes as tho’ U.K. industry eg. countervailing duties, subsidies, [limited] protective quotas.  It wd. do quite a lot.  But it doesn’t give us full freedom on no new pref. rule.  That wd. need amendmt. of Art 1., for wh. unanimity is needed.  Shd. we propose it?  i) We wd. lose.  ii) Agreed with Doms &amp; U.S. not to attack no. new pref. rule.  iii) Doms. wd. oppose us.  iv) It wd be used in Parlt. as argument for rejecting GATT altogether.  v). Our Col. advisers urge me to get on with waiver, wh. wd. give immedte. help.



D.S.	U.S. need our support.  Cdn’t we get theirs, on this?



P.T.	We won’t get support for attack on Art. 1, from any quarter.



Sal.	Not a conclusive argument con. tht. we shan’t succeed.

	If we have a good case, make it – even if we are beaten.



P.T.	Our only case is the 3 goods mentioned.  The waiver wd. meet most of our diffies. on those.  On only one, bananas, is preference the right remedy; and I believe I cd. negotiate that under – (d) of Annex.



H.A.	No hope at all of amending Art 1.

	But not sure it wdn’t be better to have bn. beaten on it.

	Cdn’t we then still get waiver?



P.T.	First course wd. lose what support we have on second.



A.E.	Pol. disadvantages i) P.T.’s (iv). above.

			      ii) wd. it make it more difficult to get waiver.



P.T.	On (ii) it would.  For Art 1 is ark of covenant.



H.M.	Cd. we represent waiver as proviso to Clause 1?



P.T.	Yes – in Parlt.



A.L.B.	Suggest waiver be condl. on ex post facto consultn. not on prior agreement.  



A.E.	(d) shd. be subsequent, not prior.



		Approved P.T.’s course.

		Para. 3 (iii) &amp; (iv) – approved.
