C.10(55)								9th February, 1955



							[Enter Home, B-H., Att.G.

		1.	Parliament.



H.C.		Business for next week.





		2.	Capital Punishment.



H.C.		Motion 10/2 proposing suspension of c.p. for 5 years.

		Speaker will call this – tho’ debate is on R. Commn’s Rept.

		What guidance, or Whip, to Govt. supporters?



P.M.		We are against it, surely.  Can’t we Whip against it?



H.C.		Govt. wd. always be against it.  But Labour Govt. allowed free vote.



A.E.		And got into a mess.



H.A.	Some of us are in diffy. : I, e.g., voted for experimental suspension.  I cdn’t vote against.  But I cd. abstain.  M/Supply are in same posn.



B.H.	Many Govt. supporters are in same position.  Motion wd. be carried on free vote.  If we Whip v. it, we shall /be unlikely to get majority have trouble.



K.	Satisfied tht. c.p. is deterrent.  In other countries experiments were made in last 30 yrs of 19th. century, when happier condns. prevailed.



Ll.G.	5 yr suspension wd. prove nothing.  We shd. decide for or against, when time comes, on straight issue of abolition.



A.E.	Surely we cd. all support that view.  Cdn’t we get them into lobby on that.



B.H.	Our supporters (some) are claiming this is matter of conscience.  They want Govt. to take definite line but allow free vote.

	Suggest I send telegram urging all to attend.  Then Whips can urge them privately to vote v. the motion.  Avoids appearance of definite Whip on matter of conscience.



									[Exit B.H.

	3.	Prince of Hanover.



Ll.G.	L.O.’s think he will win his case.  Doubt will be cast on validity of marriage of Prince Philip’s g’parents.  







CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





	L.O.’s therefore advise tht. we shd. try to stop the case.



A.E.	Part of this plan is to offer him Br. ppt.  Then we shd. support his action in Austria.

	What of effect of their having fought v. us in war.  Did that not deprive them of B. naty?



Att.G	No – tho’ it might expose them to charge of treason.



D.S.	Why not find difft. reason to repeal R. Marriages Act?



H.C.	V. diff. legn.



K.	Issue cert of doubt.  Then he need not go on with action at law.  Less certain then that publicity will be given to R. Marriages Act.



Att.G	I will try to get solrs. to w’draw action, w’out publicity.

	No reference is likely to be made in court to R. Marriages Act.



A.E.	Then why not leave decn. to courts.



K.	If case is reported, Iuri &amp; co. will get on to the R. Marriages point.



Att.G.	Lawyers will get on to it, if case is argued.



D.S.	Cd. Queen give consent retrospectively in respect of past marriages.



Sw.	Wiser to let law take its course: &amp; base action on that.



K.	V. hard on the Queen.



P.M.	General view favours allowing law to take its course.



P.T.	Then we shall have to be prepared to legislate on R. Marriages Act.



Att.G.	I will ask solrs. not to raise R. Marriages point.





4.			CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





	5.	Formosa.



A.E.	i)	R – proposal for special conference.

	ii)	Attempts to persuade U.S. to w’draw Nationalist troops fr. coastal islands.

	Pearson talked to U.S. Embassy y’day &amp; expld. to them, on Canada’s behalf, dangers of not w’drawg &amp; lack of public support for war on that basis.





	6.	Soviet Union.



A.E.	Kruschev’s success.

					[Enter PMG., Gammans &amp; H.W.



		7.	Political Broadcasting.



L.P.S.	     x/	We must prevent this.  NO pol. b’casts outside national agreemt.



PMG		Risk that Council will resign.



H.		Support L.P.S. line.



L.P.S.		Labour Party wd. support x/.  At least that is their view.



PMG.		Discuss it on basis of Members not candidates.



L.P.S.		No : it is principle we must m’tain.



Agreed : L.P.S. to discuss with Opposn. &amp; handle it on this basis.
