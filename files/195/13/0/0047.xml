C.M.5(55)							22nd June, 1955



		1.	Parliament.			[Enter B-H., Low, B-C., G.Ll.



HC.	Speakers in N. Service Debate – Thurs.  M/D. to open.  Reply by P.M., W.M. or A.H.  Final decision – Tuesday’s Cab.

	Speakers in debate on Education – Tues.

	Purchase Tax : Prayer on Thursday.





		2.	Cotton.



P.M.	Lancs. is Achilles heel for Election.

	Our present posn. is awkward.



R.A.B.	Indicated lines of his proposed statement in Budget debate to-day.

	Can improve on these bare bones by invective v. Opposition.





		3.	Railway Charges.



B.C.	Risk of continuing to delay, as Cab. decided.  If I’m asked (P.Q.) if appln. has bn. made I can’t deny it.  Risk tht. I may be asked, for juniors in B.T.C. know it.  Will appear tht. we delayed it for electoral advantage.  Might be damaging.

	Even if we don’t have to disclose in next few wks., the dates must eventually be disclosed – in annual Rpts. some months ahead.

	Shd. we continue to run these risks, or not?



K.	Cab. contemplated tht. freight increases wd. be made public.  If Minister increases these, on advice, must we not then ask Tribunal to take that into a/c. in considerg. fares appln.?  That wd. be a proper reason for delaying second element.



B.C.	They are same people : they know what they are about to recommend on freight.



K.	But not what M/T. will decide.



B.C.	They wdn’t in any event take long to take it into a/c.



K.	Knowledge tht. M/T. will put £17 M. into B.T.C. on freight wd. be a new factor, wd. it not?



B.C.	They must have assumed it in framing recommns. on fares.  

	And once Tribunal make recommns. to B.T.C. latter are under oblign. to publish it.

	Industrial dispute makes it [much] more likely tht. facts will come out.



W.M.	Not much.  For dispute doesn’t turn on wtr rlways can afford a further wage increase, but rather on arbitn.



O.P.	When wd. the increased fares come in?  That is what matters.

	Cd. that be delayed?



B.C.	Announcemt. wd. come in 10-14 days time.  Fares cd. come in 10 days’ later.  Freights cd. not come in until early June.  We cd. ask tht. 

x|	both shd. come into opn. together.



Sal.	Effect of disclosure of monkeying with this wd. be much the worse.



R.A.B.	I agree.  I favour letting it come out soon.



Sal.	Sorry there can’t also be assurances about redundancy.



B.C.	There is material we cd. use for that purpose.  Figures take credit for £15 M. saving on efficiency.



W.M.	No reason why this shdn’t be said.  Wdn’t affect strike.



P.M.	Politically delicate to press x/ on B.T.C.



A.L.B.	There is precedent for askg. tht. both shall come into opn. together.



	Agreed	   a) 	Announcement as early as possible.

		   b) 	Operation, both together, in early    [Exit R.A.B. B.H. Low. 

   	June. But care not to influence B.T.C.

    	unduly on (b).

			No “wrangling”.





		4.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	T.U.C., Chairman &amp; Secy., suggd. tht. I shd. see ASLEF.

	I saw them.  They made v. good case on differentials.  But not on decn. to strike.  I said I cdn’t act under such duress.  They said what else cd. they do.  I said : Protest &amp; later submit another appln.

	N.U.R. have now declared opposn. to strike.  They will prob. try to keep their men in.

	ASLEF or T.U.C. may see me again.  But nothg. I can do.  Any weakness on our part or by B.T.C. wd. tend to bring N.U.R. out.

	Strike pay wd. only last 3 wks.  Strike unlikely to last more than 2 wks.



							[Exit B.C., G.Ll.

[Enter Nutting.









		5.	European Defence.				



H.M.	Still diffy. over ratifications because Fr. pre-occupn. with Saar steel works.  Have suggd. tht. W.E.U. shd. arbitrate on this.  Fr. threat is tht. they will seize the works at last moment.

	Hope however for ratifns. on 5/5.  Create WEU 7/5.  Admit Germany &amp; concoct invitn. to R., for despatch by 8/5 or 9/5.



P.M.	Are U.S. reluctant still about this time-table?  If so, we mght send personal message.



H.M.	Think U.S. are now in line.





		6.	Disaramament.



H.M.	We have a good case but can’t present it until concln. of Sub-Cttee’s procdgs, wh. are secret.

	But I favour keeping Sub-Cttee. in being, by adjournment, until after Election – to avoid headline “Disarmament Fails”.  Even tho’ it involves handicap tht. we can’t deploy our best case.



P.M.	H/C. resoln. wh. we accepted related to 4-Power on H. bomb.  Agenda for 4 Power shd. be so drawn as to admit discn. of H bomb.

	But is there not more we cd. say or do to show progress on lines of resoln.

	On Disarmament, keep in line with our friends.  What do they think about going on?  Can’t insist on continuing for reasons only of our electoral advantage.



A.N.	We may find it diff. to keep going until 6/5.  We are near end of proposals : not much more to discuss.  Control – R unlikely to discuss.

	But R. don’t usually like brkg. off.  They may be our best ally on this.



Sal.	Agree H-bomb must be discussable at 4 Power.  But don’t be manoeuvred into talking of abandonmt. of nuclear weapons w’out disarmament in other weapons.



A.N.	I will aim at delaying report until after Election.  But diffies.  a) U.S. won’t want to stay after 6/5.



		Agreed.





		7.	Formosa.



H.M.	Dulles has now asked, in effect, what suggn. we can make.

	This gives us opening to suggest opn. either w’in U.N. or on Geneva precedent.



P.M.	We shd. make our posn. clear soon – to keep it out of Election.



H.M.	Aim at communicatg to U.S. early next week.
