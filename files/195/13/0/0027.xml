C.13(55)							15th February, 1955



		1.	Formosa.



A.E.	Tel. 414. from Washington.



P.M.	Unwise for U.S. to make this pronouncement now.  R. are probably pleased at m’taining tension &amp; dividing Western opinion by Peking’s words about F.  What does it matter what they say.  They cdn’t in fact take F.  U.S. wd. be unwise to speak as tho’ they offered a real danger.  They wd. fall into Commt. trap on propaganda designed to widen gulf in W. opinion.



A.E.	Also i) U.S. reports suggest Ch. intend tough business &amp; R. will support them.  Can’t believe this.  But it makes U.S. think this is not a moment for “appeasement”.

	ii) Tel. 396.  Radford thinks R. changes have decreased risk of war &amp; that this therefore enables U.S. to take firmer attitude.  He favours air-strike : said once we cd. “take China out” by those means.

	All this disturbs me.  Believe we shd. try to stop D.’s speech, if we can.  Read draft reply to W’ton 414.



P. M.	Expressed general approval – subject to reading the text.



[Enter J.T., de L., S.Ll., 

		2.	Naval Construction Programme.	H.W., C.N.S.



		..…. Not heard ....				[Exit H.W., S.Ll.,

								 Enter C.A.S.

	



		3.	Antarctica.



A.E.	Propose a Cttee. of Ministers to work out 5 year plan subject to a limit of cost.  To make recommns. w’in a month.

	To m’tain our posn. we shall have to do more than Cab. agreed in July.  F.O. think 1st priority shd.d be for aerial survey.



R.A.B.	Agree.  Reserve limit of cost until Cttee. has framed recommns.



A.L.B.	Agree.  Sinister encroachmts. : para. 5.



Sw.	Mght be a standing Cttee. – further developmts. are likely.



				Agreed.





		4.	New Colonial Office Building.



A.L.B.	Urge early decn.  Need to make a show.



N.B.	Memo. &amp; model.

	Bldg. isn’t gt.work of art : but who will design a better.  It has had all the Fine Arts etc. profile.

	Height – a new point.  Must be judged in reln. to Central Hall, which out tops it.  Smaller bldg wd. cause delay.  Fine Arts Commn. never suggd. it shd. be confined to old St. Office site.

	If you don’t, ugly eye-sore unless it were to lead to greater Parlt. Square. But diffy. there is intentn. of Chartered Surveyors.

	We cdn’t delay them w’out announcg. our real reason.



D.S.	F. Arts Commn. “wd. have preferred to see smaller bldg, set farther back : but accommn. needed made this impossible : compromise reached was improvemt.”

	Ld. Morrison said in H./L. tht. Commn. had favoured no bldg on site of W’minster Hospital.  It was only the compromise, as such, wh. was appd.

	When work starts, there will be renewed controversy.  People won’t like size or height.  That is the narrow issue : wider issue is greater Parlt. square.  Therefore favour pulling down palisade, so that public opinion may form.



Sw.	Debate in H/L.



R.A.B.	Greater Parlt. square – wd. cost £4½ -£5 M., and Guildhall as island site wd. look v. odd.  Central Hall is hideous.  Backs of Gt. Geo. St. are not pleasant.



	Smaller ques : C.O. bldg.  Where else cd. it go?



Sw.	Merger of C.O. &amp; C.R.O. wd. break Empire.  C.R.O. must deal only with full members.



D.E.	Many talks with O.L.  No point in leaving this site open unless you acquire Gt Geo. St.



A.L.B.	Some decision.  Either this – or Richmond Terrace.



N.B.	Gone to tender on steel-work.  Delay makes us look v. silly.



D.E.	We can’t wait because of Chartered Surveyors.  Once they build, the larger scheme is dead.  You won’t get a better bldg. on this v. awkward site.



Sw.	My Cttee. pointed to loss of money thro’ delays.



ALB.	£1½ M. already spent on this site.



	Adjourned.

							[Exit N.B. A.E. R.A.B.





	5.	Review of G.A.T.T.



ALB.	What alternatives cd. we adopt – in pursuance of our undertakgs.  Must have some discussion on this before Conference ends.  Want some teeth in Colonial clause : or even a break on it.



P.T.	Cohen must go back soon.

	Proposal in memo. is best we are likely to get.



ALB.	Might be better to revive old Colonial Clause &amp; get beaten on it, in order to defend ourselves.



P.T.	Let that point be reserved.  But may I give instns. on other 3 points.



H.C.	Cuts at roots of our political views.  We are turning into free trade country w’out Party realising it.



P.T.	Virtual agreemt. now with Commonwealth.  That is gt. help with Party.  If I delay, run risk of losing Commonwealth support.



H.A.	Cd. we not approve 3 other points &amp; hold separate discns. on Colonial ques.
