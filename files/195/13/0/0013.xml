C.91(54)							22nd December, 1954





[Enter Att.G., de La W.

		1.	Parliamentary Constituencies.		



P.M.	Have asked Att.G. to prepare White Paper.



Att.G.	Few introductory paras : then reprint of argument put before court : reprint judgement of Ct. of Appeal : with Roxburgh’s judgement as Appendix.



	Wd. like to publish as soon as possible.	



							[Exit Att.G.

		2.	Foreign Service – Expenditure.



A.E.	Small Ministerial Cttee. in recess.  Cd. Cab. Secretariat serve it?  



Agreed.

		3.	Independent Television.



PMG.	4 Cos. required.  One by left-wing film interests.  One by Kemsley. One by Rothemere.  Shd. the fourth company have w’in it a large element of Conservative Press.  Renwick wants to bring in D. Express and News of World.  I.T.A. think this might be last straw.  Labour might finally condemn the whole scheme.  I.T.A. have sought my guidance.



W.	What interest will K. &amp; R. have



Sw.	R. will have 50% share.



PMG.	K   ..       ..    33⅓% share, but will be Chairman.



P.M.	Tories have preponderance of Press and are used to that.  They won’t mind if same is true of T.V.

	News of World is sober, steady organ – cpd. with News Chronicle or D. Mirror.



PMG.	Neither of last named want to come into Sir Robert Renwick’s Company.



A.E.	Some of us opposed this scheme from outset – I because feared that just this sort of thing wd. happen.  I vehemently oppose idea tht. Press shd. control independent T.V. – don’t care which newspapers : don’t want them at all.  A different thing if Br. industry wd. take a hand in it.



Sal.	I strongly share that view.  This was always a bad scheme.

	We defended it qua impartial, with safeguards.

	Cd. not defend a system blatantly run by Tory interests.

	Sorry so much of cos. has gone to Press already.



P.M.G.	Renwick cd. be told he cd. add Littler &amp; some B’ham interests – but not newspapers.



A.E.	Can’t have Press controlling both the newspp. and the T.V. alternative to B.B.C.

								[Enter K.



P.M.G.	I.T.A. have sought advice of Govt.  They don’t want to allow D. Express and News of World to come in on this.



K.      x|	We need not therefore advise I.T.A.  We need only say we don’t

|	 propose to give them a direction on this.



R.A.B.	Agree.  Don’t interfere with I.T.A. discretion.  It is for their decision.

	Tho’ I support his view.



J.S.	Chairman of I.T.A. wd. take x/ – on basis tht. I had consulted Govt.



P.M.	Will be said tht. Cabinet intervened.  Will turn D. Express v. us.



A.E.	What are the safeguards worth?  I would never have agreed that Press shd. have control over this.



D.S.	Our responsibility is to be impartial.  But our impartiality issues, and finishes, in apptmt. of I.T.A.  Thereafter, we shd. not intervene unless we think I.T.A. is acting improperly – which we do not.



PMG.	I take note of what ITA have told me &amp; I am not prepared to issue any direction in the matter.



K.	“This is a matter w’in discretion of ITA. &amp; I do not propose to give any direction in the matter.”



Sal.	Awkward for those who said “it” wd. be impartial.



K.	I.T.A. are, on what we know, trying hard to keep proper balance in Press interests.  They are declining to admit further Tory newspapers.

	We decline to give a direction because I.T.A. are acting impartially.  If they were not, we shd. be ready to direct.



Sal.	But we shd. be refusing moral support, which they ask for.



PMG.	Yes : we are sheltering behind the Act.



K.	But the Act made them responsible.



		Discussion adjourned.		[Enter G.Ll., B.C., S.Ll.
