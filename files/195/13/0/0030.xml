C16(55)							22nd February, 1955



		1.	Formosa.			[Enter de L., S.Ll., Reading.,

							H.W., B.H., : Air Staff repve.



	Reply from Pres. Eisenhower to P.M.’s message – read.

	General impn. in Cabinet – a well-reasoned statement of U.S. view.  Threat to Japan as well as F., in long-term.  Considered U.S. judgemt. tht. m’tenance of Chiang’s forces is essential to security of S.E.A. &amp; that evacuation of Nationalists from Quemoy &amp; Matsus wd. undermine their morale.

	Diff., in view of this letter, to press them to change their policy.



		Agreed :	circulate in boxes on runner, so that Ministers

				can consider it more carefully.





		2.	Aircraft Production : Swift.



S.Ll.	Mark 3, tho’ improved, is not fit for operational (squadron) service because not efficient at heights required.

	Mark 4.  40 are nearly finished &amp; will have to be accepted.  But further Hunters will have to be bought for use in lieu.

	Marks 5 &amp; 7 : better hopes, because improvemt. in Mark. 4, tht. these will be satisf. for role intended.  Shall know in a month’s time – about 5.

	Mark 6 is out because role wd. be at gt. height, where machine is inefficient.

	Mark 7 : we shall know in 3 mos. wtr it will work with Blue Sky. 

	Decisions recommended.

	i)   replace Mark 4’s by Hunters.  Tho’ accept delivery of 40.

	ii)  m’tain order 50 Mark 5.’s.  Further decn. in a month.

	iii) m’tain order for 30 Mark 7.’s.  Further decn. in 3 months.

	iv)  cancel order for Mark 6.

	This wd. keep firm in being &amp; capable of producg. new naval fighter.

	If Mark 7 is successful, rather more can be ordered later.

	As insurance –

	iv)  see wtr fighter recce equipmt. (Mark 5) can be fitted into Hunter.  This is easy to ascertain.

	v)  On Mark 7.  Order Blue Sky weapons.  Explore means of converting Hunter to take it.  When weapons are ready (16 mos) we shall have one or other aircraft to take it.  Some risk : but justified by avoidance of delay in producing guided missiles, in which RAF need early practice.



H.M.	Support these recommns.

	Throughout this, better has bn. enemy of good – partly for financial reasons.

	If we wait for Blue Jay and Javelin, we bank on getting both right and in time.  Sorry to think we were putting all our g. missiles into this basket.  Therefore, we shd. make Blue Sky.  For what aircraft?  Prs. Swift will, with Mark 7.  But also adapt Hunter to carry it.  And off-load some work fr. Hawkers to other firms.  Need also to keep Vickers’ team in being for prodn. of naval fighters.

	Addl. cost of our recommns., as cpd. with cutting losses, is £3 M.



D.S.	Support these recommns.

	Always diff. to know when to abandon attempts to improve.  18 mos. ago it was thght Swift wd. be better than Hunter.

	But this is moment to admit tht. Swift has failed as all-purpose fighter.

	Will this affect off-shore orders for Hunters?  Wd. increased demands for our own use reduce those earnings?  



S.Ll.	Prodn. will be 50 a month.  May be some delay.  But manageable.  Shall have to run prodn. for another 6/9 months.



de. L.	Strong support for recommns.

	On g. missiles, it wd. be wrong to rely wholly on one method.  Blue Sky is diff. system fr. Blue Jay – which may not work, tho’ superior in conceptn.



R.A.B.	Cost of these recommns. : £24½ M. in addn. to £10 M. on Marks 1-3?2.

	Cost of cancellg. all : £21 M. – but more Hunters &amp; Canberras wd. then be needed.

	My only doubt is wtr we produce Blue Sky.  Wd. like to discuss that further with H.M.  Spent £5 M. on research.  Tho’ I’m disposed to accept this.



		Agreed :	Accept recommns., subject to R.A.B. discussg. 			with M/D. proposals re Blue Sky weapons.



P.M.	Form of announcement.  Avoid impn. tht. Swift is a total failure.



H.M.	Don’t want to say things wh. we may soon have to contradict.  Can’t avoid implying doubts about Swift.  Tho’ we must be careful not to damage morale of firm.

Read provisional draft answer.	Approved in principle.

						[Exit de L., Air Staff repve.





		3.	Monopolies.



P.T.	Motion deploring slow progress in dealing with monopolies etc., etc.,

	Wd. sooner have amendment to this, rather than straight vote.

	H/C. – Thursday 24/2.

	H. Wilson will open.  I will follow.  Who shd. wind up?  My Parly. Secy. or I.?  Gaitskill is speaking.



R.A.B.	Don’t take it too seriously.



P.M.	Favour rough language v. monopolies even tho’ action can’t be taken at once.



P.T.	Acceptance of report on Calico Printers will show toughness enough.





									[Exit S.Ll.



		4.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	Degree of infln. in economy is affecting b/p.

	All factors affectg. b/p. are going against us.

	Diseases of prosperity.  Exports good : but imports higher.  	Terms of trade worsening.  Invisibles not strong – early cost of oil settlement.  Overseas exp’re. is v. high. 

	Trafficking in transferable sterling is rising.

	Feb. figures will show substantial loss of reserves.

	Will tell Cabinet, on Thurs. or next week, what steps I must take.  Will involve action at home – wh. I shall discuss in H.P.C. Wedy.  Restn. of h.p. is prob. necessary.



P.M.	Act quickly.



P.T.	And do all necessary things at once.





		5.	Lancashire.



P.T.	As in memo.

	Recommend we ask Colonies to go slow on licensing of J. textiles.

	Ask R.A.B. to consider purchase tax. possibility.



R.A.B.	Will keep this open – tho’ v. gt. diffies., esp. in a time of inflationary pressure.

	Paymts. agreemt. with J. We shd. tell them we want them to take more fr. us.  Defer approach to Colonies m’while.

	Good memo.  Major political problem.  But recent visits of Ministers to Lancs. have done some good.  Suggest no decisions to-day.



ALB.	Diff. to justify approach to Colonies except on general b/p. grds.  Prefer to p’pone as R.A.B. suggests.



P.T.	Early warning wd. be justified, in genl. terms, because J. running into sterling surplus.  Wd. have steadying effect.



Sw.	Indian Budget due at end/Feb.  They mght be willing to adjust quotas.  We cd. ask them, at once.  But will it have any practical effect in Lancs., whi. exports only 3-5 m. yds. to India.  We shd. not promise, in return, to abstain fr. quota on imports into U.K. fr. India.  We may have to do so.

	Art 35 decn. on Japan – wd. be better made in May than June, qua Lancs.



P.M.	I have bn. asked to receive deptn. from cotton trade.  Diff. for me to refuse.



H.C.	Thght No. 10 was not open for these things.  In recent years P.M. has not received such deputns., surely.



P.T.	These are only the manufrs.  Have asked Cotton Bd., wh. represents all interests in industry, to come &amp; see me with their proposals.



H.W.	Most responsible T.U. leader in Lancs. is at I.L.O. – and cd. not attend this deptn.



W.	What can we say we will do about Indian cloth?  We shall have to come to quota.  Wd. sooner do it quickly.



RAB.	Wd. affect our other economic interests, incldg. other trades in Lancs.



P.T.	Their real trouble is loss of exports of cheaper cloth.



H.W.	I agree with this.

	Boot/shoe, hosiery etc., are suffering nearly twice as much as cotton.  But they don’t complain because they have confidence as cotton has not.

	Quick relief in Colonial markets wd. be best.



A.L.B.	Wd. accept suggn. of warning to Colonies – if I cd. agree draft with P.T. &amp; R.A.B.



W.	No unemplt. wd. result in Lancs. cotton.  Labour wd. move because there are vacancies.
