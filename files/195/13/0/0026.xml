C.12(55)							11th February, 1955



									[Enter Att.G.

		1.	Prince of Hanover.



P.M.		This does not affect D/Ed. – but his mother.

		Read submission to Queen.



Att.G.	Solr. for Prince Ernst will do utmost to ensure tht. refce. is not made in the action to R. Marriage Act.

	

									[Exit Att.G.

						[Enter 	de L., C.A.S., H.W., H.Br., 

C.N.S., J.T., S.Ll.





		2.	Aircraft Production : White Paper.



		Considered para. by para.



H.W.	Cd it be made clear, in para. 6, tht. this decn was not taken by aircraft industry.



H.M.	Whole document is in terms of official decision : cd. not be misunderstd.



H.B.		Para 10 open to criticism because most research is contracted out.

			Agreed : delete 2nd. sentence.

	Para. 20.  Last sentence shd. be in line with Ty. reply to Estimates Cttee.  



H.M.	I was not consulted on wording of that reply. 



H.B.	Believe Dpts, incldg M/Def., were consulted. 



de L.	Oct. ’50, experimental 535 was then flying.  Air Miny. asked for axial-flow type of this : and order was placed before detailed specification was completed.

Agreed : re-draft, so as to separate Swift from Hunter, &amp; make it more clear how hurried the ordering of former was.



S.Ll.	Para 22.  Another consequence was tht. particular firms were seriously over-loaded.  This cd. be added.	Agreed.



D.S.)	Proposed changes in para. 35

J.T. )		Approved.



H.M.	Para 36.  Probly. will never fly from a carrier.  Posn. is therefore worse than para. suggests.



D.S.	Indicate its vintage : we inherited it.  

Agreed : revise para. 36.



D.S.	Para. 37.  Gannet Developmt. has proceded a long way when our predecessor changed it fr. 2 to 3 seater.



H.M.	I will consider this.



P.M.	Add conception date.



D.S.	Para 39.  Amend to show that some are already in service.



H.C.	Consider bringing together in one place all refces. to helicopters.



H.M.	Unwise : not a promising story.

	Perhaps better confine whole Paper to fighting machines – and omit references to helicopters &amp; freighters.

	Or leave isolated references, as they stand.



H.M.	Para 42. This memo. contains no safeguard – “so far as our resources allow” – as in main Paper.

	General disagreement with this point.  Agreed. say “provided” vice “involved” in para. 1.



A.E.	Paras 43-66 are diffuse.  Cd. they be shortened?



A.L.B.	Para 42 is a better ending.  Cd. it go into Appendix?



H.M.	It is “Prolegomena to study of aircraft production”.

	Shall we make it a separate Part II.    Genl.  Considerations.

	

Agreed &amp; print as Appendix with title  ..          ..           ..



H.B.	Then delete para. 66.



Sal.		And expand para. 43.



D.S.	Para. 46.  Refer to examples of facilities e.g. wind-tunnel.

	Para. 60.  Can’t divide modifns. into these 2 classes.  Also “required performance” is arbitrary : shdn’t consider aircraft a failure because the specification was set too high.



H.M.	Modns. essential to safety : performance is related to capacity of adversaries viz., operational requirements.

			I will consider this point – with de L. and S.Ll.

			Start with safety.  Then “required minimum p’formance”.

		Para. 65.  Agreed omit.

		Para. 66.  Delete (h)



de L.	Delete 2nd sentence of (d) – which isn’t true of bombers.



H.B.	(b) – wd. have preferred “adequate”.	No.





	3.	Aircraft Production.  Swift.



H.M.	Decn. on Swift must be announced when genl. Def. Wh. Paper is published.  Wd. be dishonest to hold it back.

	But aircraft Wh. Paper is necessary to support Swift decision.

	This is the case for simultaneous publication of the 2. Wh. Papers.



P.M.	I wd. prefer to do aircraft on 17/2 and Def. Wh. Paper on followg Monday.



H.C.	Must leave 10 days btwn. publn. &amp; debate.  That will crowd into Estimates.

	Wd. prefer to stick to 17/2 for Def. Wh. Paper.



P.M.	Too much material on same day.  Will choke the Press.



S.Ll.	Practical diffy. in cancellg.  Swift orders hurriedly.  For firm has produced later type.  Need another 7 days’ delay.

	Diffy. is one of reaching clear-cut decisions on Swift in v. short time.



H.B.	Agree.  Millions are at stake.  Decn. can’t be influenced by timing.



S.Ll.	…… not heard ……



de L.	Believe this forecast is much too optimistic.



H.M.	Qua production : important tht. some compromise manuf’re shd. go on, in order to keep firm’s organisn. in being.

	Also, firm may claim tht. latest type has not bn. sufficiently tested.  	Unwise to rush them.



C.A.S.	It wd. be wrong to hope tht. gun-fighter types will ever be satisfactory.

	Recommns. in memo. are, in my view, sound.

	M/S. formula is over-optimistic on Type 4.



de L.	Language used shd. not raise false hopes.

	Even if the more hopeful marks proved adequate, only small numbers wd. be needed.



H.M.	We cd. aim at announcg. final decision after publn. of Paper but before debate.  Paras. of Paper wd. then use M/S. new formula.



S.Ll.	Then make it appear in W. Paper tht. Swift posn. is v. grave.

	Don’t take too much weight on later decn. re Swift.





		Agreed : Present general    Def. Paper 18/2.

			  ..   ..    Aircraft    ..        ..     17/2.

			Announce Swift decn. later, before debate.

			Or, if possible, each Paper one day earlier.





	4.	British Prisoners in Korea.



A.E.	Now is the moment.



H.M.	As soon as possible after next week.
