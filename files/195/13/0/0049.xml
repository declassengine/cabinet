C.M.7(55)							27th April, 1955



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.[Enter A.H., G.Ll., C.H., B.C.



W.M.	ASLEF officers are seeking a way out.  Trying to get agreemt. to a request by T.U.C. &amp;ASLEF to M/L. to convene mtg. with B.T.C. – not on money or differentials but on procedure.  At best they will suspend, not w’draw, strike motions.  But likely to accept award m’while.

	If this proposal comes to me to-day, I will arrange for mtg. at M/L. – tho’ I shall not participate.



A.E.	Favour this, but formula is pretty tight.  Minister cdn’t refuse to provide facilities for mtg.



B.C.	B.T.C. wd. have to insist on i) indefinite suspension of notice ii) acceptance of award iii) readiness to discuss any outstanding ques.



RAB	No indicn. of weakness involved.



	Draft of statement to be made in H/C. by M/L. approved, subject to amendments.



Ll.G.	Service leave.  To be stopped Friday if G.P.O. lorries are to be driven on Monday.



P.M.	What delay wd. be involved if you waited?



PMG.	Don’t want a back-log at outset.  Wd. upset emergency arrangemts.  No Service vehicle will go to a rlway station.



B.C.	That meets B.T.C. anxieties.



A.H.	Only 500 men.  Mght not become generally known.



W.M.	Ready to accept that risk – very small.



		Agreed :  accept risk : H.O. to have statement in readiness

			   for issue if need be – P.M. to see draft.



						[Exit A.H., Ch H., B.C., G.Ll.

		2.	Cotton.



R.A.B.	a)  Clear that quota is only answer to pol. needs of Lancs., and prs. its economic needs.  R.M. thinks U.S. wd. resent quota v. Comm. less than general quota, wh. wd. lose us our bicycles.  Satisfied, however, tht. it wd. have to cover all Colonies incldg. H. Kong.  Believe we shall have to come to it w’in 6 months.  Accept, however, fact tht. this general issue shd. not be raised just before Election.

	b)  How much will Indian concession help?  Suppose it means 15 m. square yds. (increase of 12 m.) – it wd. give us a worth-while case.  Wd. impress Opposn., who don’t really favour quota.  

	c)  Purchase tax.  	i) Lancs. will be content with nothing less than complete w’drawal.  Street has now said so.  Means £42 M.

				ii) Wd. do as much harm as good to make minor concession now.  Ready to defend that now &amp; in Lancs.

				iii) Possibility is 100% removal of p.t. from cotton.  Cdn’t do it for wool because made up by numerous small people.  Yorks. have now protested v. what we have done already.

	Price redns. wd. be small : adminve. diffies. wd. be great, for tax wd. have to be collected fr. retailers not manufrs.  Changes wd. have to be made in adminn. after election.

	We shd. be brkg. into p.t. en principe.  It now yields £300 M.  Can’t risk its collapse.  Ratio of 25% - 25% for cloth &amp; made-up is as far as we dare go.  Process order wd. be resented by trade.

	Diff. to make concession with dignity &amp; honesty.

				iv)  Considered raising D. level.  But it leaves higher quality goods unhelped.

				v)  Redn. of p.t. on clothes.  But concession not needed.



W.	My informn. is tht. if we don’t give some satisfn. we shall prob. lose 7 Lancs seats, which we now hold.



H.	Need for v. careful prepn. before we encroach on Comm. free entry. cf. recent Canadian refusal to limit our textile imports in interest of their home trade.



Ll.G.	Support this reluctance to accept quota as perfect remedy.



D.E.	Wd. also lose us Liberal votes in Lancs.  Wage earners in Lancs. are less worried about this then mill-owners.



P.T.	All this means tht. only extra concession we can make is on p.t. 

Admit Ty. diffies.  100% redn. on cloth wd. give our candidates all they want because that is what Lancs. has asked for, right or wrong.  Does distort tax : wd. encourage people to buy cloth &amp;have it made up : but that is against trend of mass habit.



O.P.	Can’t clap on quota.  Diff. to make concession on p.t. w’out appearance of weakness.  After Election, surely p.t. will have to go, on cotton textiles.  Cd. not candidates in Lancs. pledge themselves as individuals to work for abolition?



P.M.	We (C.R.O.) try to get Indian decision by 2/5 for announcement 5/5

	We reserve decn. to make further concession on p.t. until we know wtr Indian concession is enough.  If it isn’t we have a reason (other than Opposn. pressure) for doing more on p.tax.



	3.	Austria.



H.M.	i)  Neutrality.  Accept it militarily but not otherwise.  	     Agreed.

	ii) Guarantee.  Must see how this works out.  Four-Power : or right to intervene : or oblign. to intervene : or what?



P.M.	R. usually mean it operates if all Four Powers agree to operate it. i.e. jointly but not severally.  We needn’t go beyond that if Austria is content with it.



H.M.	Will report back on this.  U.S. won’t be able to go too far.
