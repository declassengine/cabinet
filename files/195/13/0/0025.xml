C.11(55)								9th February, 1955



				[Enter 3 Serv. Ministers, G.Ll., S.Ll., Home, B.H.



		1.	Parliament : Salaries of Junior Ministers.



R.A.B.		Ques of judgement wtr this is right time.

		The case on merits is v. strong.

		Don’t press at present the extra £1.000 Parly. salary for Cab. Ministers.



H.C.	Don’t think this is right time.  If any odium, we get it at once : benefit wd. be deferred to next Parlt.  Future P.M., forming Govt. after Election, cd. assure candidates for junior posts tht. this wd be done at once.

	After row on Judges, Members’ pay etc., there will be nausea for this sort of thing.



A.E.	If we do one, we must do other (expenses for Peers); and that wd. tend to arouse a fuss – before Election.



Sal.	Junior Ministers in H/L. are in worst case of all.  Therefore, if salaries are not raised, case is stronger for early allowances for Peers.



A.L.B.	P’pone until after election.



H.A.	Junior Ministers, not M/State, are the hardest case.  But no point in havg. legn. unless it comes into operation at once.



H.M.	Wait until after Election.  Then, if we have lost, we revert to our directorship.  If we have won, we can make a comprehensive job of it – with 4 years before we face electorate again.



A.E.	I agree.  M’while, work out a good comprehensive plan.



Sal.	Hard for me to accept, once more, p’ponement of Peers’ expenses.

	Cd. Cabinet defer final decision until nearer date of Samul’s debate in H/L. on Reform – 7/3.



H.W.	Most junior Ministers wd. be willing to wait if, as I believe, there is electoral advantage of waiting.



H.C.	Can we be told, before next discn., exactly how many people actually are attending in H/Lords.

			Agreed : Resume discn. on Peers in 2 wks’ time.



										[Ext B.H.

		2.	Defence White Paper.



H.M.		May I have authority to make minor, literary, amendments?  Yes.



P.M.	We have avoided premature disclosure : we can therefore announce H. bomb decision in this White Paper, publd. on 17/2.



H.M.	V. good.  Then I can bring out Aircraft memo. on same date.

	First ques of substance.  Do we announce decision on H. bomb.

Agreed.

	ii)   Para. 7. words to make it clear tht. ultimate object is disarmament, immediate duty is to be strong.



Sal.	iii)  Add words to make it clear tht. this weapon is efffctive v. continents as well as islands?



H.M.	Wd. sooner do that in speech.  Or we may get come-back tht. all other weapons are useless &amp; can be discarded.



								[Enter Ll.G.

H.M.	iv)	National Service.  Final sentence of para. 72.

		If we give any hint of reduction, there will be Dutch auction.



R.A.B.	Is there a chance of reducing it later?  Accept this now.



de L.	Not unless regular recruiting improves v. greatly.



P.M.	I wd. prefer 3 years + selective service.



H.M.	v)	Mobile Defence Corps.  Generally &amp;, in particular, H. reserves.



de L.	Last year’s Act applied to all services but in practice applied mainly to RAF because we had largest no. of reservists.  Hope language used will leave it open to use reservists of other Services – for changes in T.A. may make it possible to use Army reservists too.



A.E.	vi)	Para. 55 may be a little optimistic – in view of Formosa, changes in Kremlin.  Mght use phrases employed by P.M. in Commonw. Mtg – e.g. annihilating power of nuclear weapons itself ….

	vii)	Para 10.  Add tht. this will prevent independent action by any of the parties to the Agreements.



D.S.	viii)	Para. 83.  Ballistic rocket is joint U.K./U.S. project.  U.S. attached v. gt. importce. to secrecy.  We shd. verify tht. they are content with this reference.



H.M.	I have a new draft covering 77-9 and 83.

	It has bn. seen in U.S.  I cd. invite their attentn. to this passage.



H.	ix)	Para. 128.  Better to say : “Problems are new.  This will be amplified ….”  Agreed : omit admission in first sentence.



de L.	x)	Para. 25. “bomber force” vice “means of delivery”.



H.M.	This covers rockets.  “means of delivery” has become accepted phrase in this context.  Bombers are not the only means – even now.

	Submarines, clandestine are also possible as means.

	xi)	Will add, in Section VII, somethg. about Commonwealth Defence Mtgs – in consultn. with C.R.O.			Agreed.



Sal.	xii)	What about R.A.A.F.?



H.M.	New scheme is about to be announced – btwn. publn. of this &amp; Air Estimates memo.  M’while only a vague reference.



		Approved – for publication on 17/2.



						[Exit Serv. Min., H.M., S.Ll.

	3.	Atomic Energy : Civil Uses.



Sal.	Paras 11 &amp; 20 contain refes. to prodn. of plutonium for mil. purposes at Calder Hall.  H’to we haven’t disclosed this.  But it is widely known.  And U.S. wd. not dislike refes to mil. aspects in this Paper.

		Publn. on 15/2.



R.A.B.		Para 34.  Is last sentence a safe prospect?



G.Ll.		Yes.



			Approved.
