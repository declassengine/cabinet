C.M.14(55)							14th June, 1955



							     [Enter G.Ll., B.C., H.W., B-H.

		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	B.T.C. y’day made new offer : M/L. to appoint referee to recommend rate for drivers – N.U.R. to concur &amp; give evce. : / strike notices to be cancelled as soon as referee’s award is made : /B.T.C. other proposals to stand.

	// was unexpected.

	Aslef were suff. interested to warrant calling in N.UR.  They were seen by me and B.T.C. around 10.30 p.m.  They were not ill-disposed : promised to consider at 9.30 a.m. today.  B.T.C. &amp; ASLEF are mtg. at 11. a.m.  If all goes well, there will be a joint mtg. of the 3 around 11.30 a.m.

	I cdn’t w’draw //.  But at joint mtg, I will appeal to Aslef – promising to appoint referee to-day – to call off strike now instead of on his award, esp. as they will have promised in advance to accept award.  I have a Lord Justice ready as referee.



P.M.	They will promise to go back before there is award.  But there will be award before they go back: and tht looks like a “success”.

	Hope therefore M/L. will press his appeal.



W.M.	Yes : and publish it.  To make it clear tht. we shan’t be thought to have suggested this.

	Tho’ finding of this figure doesn’t end need for negotiations.



P.T.	Include top-grade firemen in reference : but in return demand return to work before referee’s award.



P.M.	That wd. be a v. good improvement.  M/L. shd. propose it.



G.Ll.	N. Derby miners have resolved not to load “unusual” wagons next week.

	If this goes on, it may be diff. to restrain miners fr. coming out.



R.A.B.	By end of this week, we shall be in more serious trouble.



P.M.	Dock strike is doing even more damage.

	As soon as rail strike is over, I and M/L. will see T.U.C. &amp; press them to deal with that situation, wh. they promised to handle.



H.W.	Merseyside are starting new Stevedores Union, independent of Ldn.



	Liner Strike.



B.C.	i)  Establ. pool of industry is writing to Ascania workers threatening to report to M/L. tht. they have left the industry.  Those of mil. age wd. then be liable to call-up – &amp; large propn. are.  N.U. Seamen support this move v. strongly.



W.M.	They wd. be called up quickly for medical inspn.



J.S.	Likely to have a v. salutary effect.



B.C.	ii)  Saxonia (Cunarder at Lpl).  Tried y’day to get her into river : &amp; deck crews refused to obey orders.  Cunard are considering prosecn. under M.S. Act.  N.U. Seamen’s views are being consulted by us.  This is more serious than breaking articles.



Ll.G.	Stacey is a deserter from Mauretania.  Not a Communist.



B.C.	But Fedn. &amp; Cunard think selected prosecution wd. be unwise.



H.A.	We shall be blamed if procdgs. are not taken.



K.	Att. G. has a residuary responsibility for enforcemt. of law.  If private prosecutor fails to act, he can direct prosecn. if he thinks it in public interest.



B.C.	Q. Mary due out on Thurs.  There is an ill-disposed element in the crew – which is not as steady as that of Q.Elizabeth.



							[Exit W.M., H.A.W.

[Enter A.H.





		2.	Cyprus.

				

H.M.     x|	C.O. and I agree tht. nothg. wd. come of launchg. new constitutional

		proposals unilaterally.

	What we need : better posn. in UN : understandg. with Gk. &amp; Turk. Govts.  Plan in this memo. is designed to secure both objectives.

	Tho’ Papagos is yappy, we might not see a better Govt. if he disappeared.

	But much feeling in Greece wh. dislikes Enosis.  And Turks have taken a strong line.

	Therefore invite to conference in Ldn.  Either both will agree : or Turks alone will agree : to come.  If Gks refuse, it strengthens our posn. in U.N.  If they both come, we wd. table a definite plan.

	Cd. Cab. approve this procedure.  Then, while I am away, Dpts. cd. hammer out a plan &amp; submit it to Cab. in 2 wks’ time.  No invitation m’while to Gks. or Turks.  When invitn. is sent, we wd. make invitn. public.



A.L.B.	Accept reluctantly x/.  It wd. be rejected out of hand.  Therefore I favour preliminy. talk with Gks.

	If we make no move, they will go to U.N. again &amp; we can’t hope to avert discn. this time by procedural means.

	U.S. are getting annoyed with Gks. over Cyprus agitn.  We shall win them over still more if we send this invitn. – even if Gks. refuse it.

	Wd. welcome help of colleagues (?Cttee.) in discussion of alternative plans.



H.M.	Our firmness (e.g. cancelln. of NATO exercise) has begun to produce effects in Greece.



S.Ll.	Favour this on balance.  May be awkward precedent – for discussing with other countries the future constitutional developmt. of a Br. Colony.  We have always m’tained e.g. in U.N. tht. this is domestic ques.



A.L.B.	It does endanger posn.  But we cd. stress tht. it’s discn. betwn. NATO colleagues, &amp; make that the justification for unusual procedure.



P.M.	If it weren’t for U.N., I wd. see it off – by firmness.

	Indeed, I still feel there’s somethg. to be said for letting medecine work.

	I have in past told Grks tht. this is not discussable.

	Cyprus is not Gk., it never was : it is Br. territory.

	Work out alternative plans : but reserve final decision on proposal for talks, at least until we have seen what proposal we shall put forward.



H.M.	Invitn. cd. avoid appearance of readiness to discuss sovereignty.



Sal.	Am anxious about this.  Gt. danger of U.N. is intervention in domestic affairs of sovereign states.  Enormous scope for little Powers to pry.  Once we admit this right, we shall be harried to death.  How wd. French like this precedent in reln. to N. Africa.

	We must not give any impn. of weakness over this. 

	Pressure in U.N. forces us to admit Gk. interest in Constitn. bldg in a Colony.



H.	I dislike it, too.  Effect on Indian minority problem in Africa.  Will we be asked to bring India into consultn. on constitutional advance there.



A.L.B.	Our plan will take it out of U.N.  And if it goes there again we shall be defeated.  What do we do then, unless we w’draw from all discns. in U.N. on these ques.



H.M.	Can’t get a new constitn. that wd. work in Cyprus unless it is accepted by Gk. &amp; Turkish Govts.

	We always intended to tell them in advance.



P.M.	Different to invite them to confer.



		{Let us work out what our plan is.

		{Then, in 2 wks., Cab. can decide finally what procedure

		{we follow in pursuing that plan.

		{M’while, remain tough with the Gks.



	Cttee. of Cab.  C.O., M/State F.O., M/D. (Chairman), Comm. Secy.



							[Exit A.H.

[Enter Att.G.





		3.	House of Commons Disqualification Bill.	



Ll.G.	Genl. introdn.  Reference to N. Ireland.



Att.G.	Officials of Colonies &amp; Commonwealth.  I’m not sure it’s wise to leave this uncovered.  There are various inconsistencies.  Aso para 5 of Annex B. under this, N. Macpherson wd. not have bn. disqualified.

	I wd. therefore prefer to adhere to Soskice Plan and disqualify these people.



H.	Wd. need a good deal of thought.



Att.G.	Wd. sooner the Bill was silent on this point.



		Ll.G., A.L.B., H., Att.G. to confer on this.



	Para. 5(v).  Local Govt. Officials.



J.S.	I wd. prefer to disqualify, as H. Aff. Cttee. originally decided.  For – i) L.A. assocns. wd. support it : so wd. LabourParty in H/C.



K.	I support this view.  



P.M. 	So do I.



P.M.	Let this point be considered (By whom?).



	Para. 5(vi)



H.	Will provoke sharp re-action from Irish Republic.



		Ll.G. to review with H., fr. angle tht. English Peers sit in

		Irish Senate, with some benefit.



	Agreed:	Report on points of doubt – as above

			Consult N. Ireland, before introdn.



   							[Exit Att.G.





		4.	Colonial Immigrants.



Ll.G.	As in memo.



A.L.B.	I favour enquiry.  But it will take longer than H.O. think.  And awkward if they find against action.



	T. of r :	i) Comm. &amp; Empire.

			ii) Omit “or any class of them” because it invites Cttee. 		to recommend discrimination.



H.	Are we sure they will, w’out these words.



P.M.	Don’t t. of r. rush too quickly to legn.  Why not have it more general.



Sal.	Composition.  Will they not all have formed views? on this ques – regardless of their occupational expertise.  

Is it dangerous to leave responsibility to Cttee.



R.A.B.	Wd. prefer a less representative Cttee. &amp; broader t. of refce.  This body wd. take much too long.



D.S.	Cd. we rely on publicity for a Govt. statement of the facts.



R.A.B.       y/	Report by officials. Publish it &amp; give it publicity.



		Restriction in other parts of Commonwealth.

		P’pone until we see y/.





		5.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



H.M.	As in memo.  A ques of judgment.



P.T.	Bad if we were sole cause of keeping J. out.  J.’s admission will be represented as cause of all our industrial diffies. outside U.K.  Art xxxv only helps us in home market.

	Cd. we not wait &amp; see how the others vote.  If she gets 23 votes, or is sure of them, we cd. abstain.  

	If it’s clear tht. she won’t get in, I wdn’t oppose H.M.’s view.



H.M.	But	i)  no vote is counted as a negative.

		ii) other countries will ask our advice.



R.A.B.	We may have to vote for it in end.  Lancs. won’t like it any better later than now.  Somethg. to be said for doing it now.  Wd. gain us credit with Japan.



H.M.	“Vote early”.



P.T.	Won’t help to prepare for H/C. debate on G.A.T.T.



D.E.	Time our vote in reln. to i) payments discussions &amp; ii) commercial talks.



P.T.	Won’t apply to i) : &amp; ii) is too long-term.



H.M.	Are we prepd. to risk J. being excluded because we don’t vote?



R.A.B.	No.  If there were risk of her not being admitted, we shd. have to take steps to see tht. she is.



P.M.	Then it means tht. at end we shall have to vote for Japan.



		Agreed:	In principle, J. must not be excluded because of 			our abstention.  H.M. to find out how votes will 			go.  Cabinet to decide in 7-10 days.



P.T.	If it really is view of Cab. tht. we shall have to vote for it in the end, there might be advantage in voting now.





		6.	International Finance Corporation.



H.M.	As in memo.



P.M.	Awkward timing because of Schumaniacs Bill.



H.C.	We have bn. deceived – internationalists!



		Approved.





		7.	Israel.



H.M.	Some think Israel contemplates early attack on Gaza strip.  We ourselves have no direct informn. to this effect.

	Rumour that Nassers’ posn. is shaky.  That mght make him more truculent.



P.M.	Israel Elections.  Ben Gurion trying for a come back : if he succeeds, he will be bellicose – always has had view tht. quick slog at Arabs is best bet.



H.M.	As a result, we are checking by adminve. means the supply of arms to both sides.

	A review will be submitted to Cabinet.  Not satisfy because others (e.g. French Swedes) aren’t co-operating.



S.Ll.	Thought we meant to give something to Israel fr. Canal Base.  But in Oct. M/State F.O. gave undertakg. tht. we wd. give nothing.  Unfortunate.  We cd. have left some A.A. guns behind.



P.M.	Believe this pledge had to be given, because of pressure.  If so, we can’t go back on it.
