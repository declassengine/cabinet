C.80(54).							29th November, 1954



		1.	Parliament.  Debate on Address.		[Enter P.B-H.



P.M.	3 hr. discn. with C.R.A. – agreeable but guarded.

	We haven’t had confl. talks with Opposn.  They offered them to us.

	I suggd. possibility – informally.  He liked the idea.  Suggd. Gaitskell, H.M., E.Sh. and himself.  That wd. be v. convenient.  Not certain, of course, tht. Labour Party will accept the idea.  A.E. might offer it, in course of debate.  Then H.M. cd. make short statement on actual changes.



A.E.	Right to try for this.  But doubt if I shd. say it if CRA has not responded.

	Mght embarrass him with his supporters.



P.M.	Will write suggesting we make this offer publicly, unless he objects.



							[Exit P.B.H.



		2.	British Somaliland.



A.E.	Want to sign to-night.  Ethiopian For Secy. has returned for this purpose.

	He is friendly to us.

	With this, there is hope that tribes will be quiet.  W’out it, E. will say “get out” &amp; there will be trouble with tribes.



A.L.B.	This secures our essential interests.  Best we can get.  If we were cleared out altogether, it wd. involve us in a mil. commitmt. to keep order among tribes.



Sw.	Glad no publicity before Jan.  Accept need for it.  W’draw earlier doubts.



H.M.	Troops in reserve : from now?  



A.L.B. 	Now, in case it leaks.





		3.	Investment Policy.			[Enter Birch, I. McL.



R.A.B.	Economy is stretched.  Claims other than housing must have a turn.

	We must try to limit subsidised housing.  Control over Govt. claims wd. help to m’tain confidence.  Don’t want signs of returning inflation next spring.



D.S.	Agree – mustn’t overload bldg. industry.  No immedte. danger.  But end of bldg. licensing involves diffy. – only control now available is over subsidised housing our only means of ensuring tht. industry isn’t overloaded).  But, with care, I can reduce rate of allocns. twds target of 140,000.  Shall have to be imprecise about future policy – giving sops where necessary to allay local grievances w’out giving figure for U.K.  But slum clearance will appear inconsistent with this.

	Avoid public statements about overloading industry &amp; means of reducg. pressure.



P.M.	Hospitals.  Nos. built in Austr. since war, contrasted with St. Thomas’ Repns. from Queen.

	After pensions, hospitals shd. be in our minds.





		4.	Education Policy.



D.E.	5 m. to 6.7 m. in decade from ’47 to ’57.  This increase in nos. of children has prevented us fr. improvg. condns. in bad schools.

	Can we get on with that now, especially in rural areas?  Max. cost wd. be £5 M. p.a.

	No proposal yet for slum schools in towns.



D.A.	Wd. help agric. – m’tain labour force if a move on this was in sight.



P.M.	Regret tht. leaving age can’t be reduced.  Cdn’t agree to raising of age of entry.

	Cdn’t attendance be voluntary after 14?



D.E.	No.  Teachers say tht. clever children, not dolts, wd. leave – for they know they can earn.  Wd. go back on Butler Act principle.



R.A.B.	Wd. save no money unless you sacked teachers.  Wd. only reduce nos. in classes.  Politically, v. controversial.

	Support D.E.’s plan re bldg.  This will enable us to start re-organn. of rural schools first recommended by Hadow in ’27.

	Economies.  £224 has risen to £303 M.  Huge Vote.  Due mainly to increased nos.  Wd. have wshed to see compensating economies, e.g. on school meals.  If we can’t increase charge, can’t we save money by other means e.g. adminn.



D.E.	Will review its adminn.  Will discuss with Ty. means of economy w’out altering charge.



H.C.	Don’t spend too much on playing-fields in village schools.  In the country they don’t need them.

							[Exit I.McL., Birch.



		5.	Gibraltar : Trade Talks with Spain.



A.L.B.	Sitn. is getting serious.  Don’t want to encourage Spaniards to do more, by admitting tht. we are hurt.

	Trouble : Spain can hurt us more than we them – by economic measures.

             	y|	We might reduce Br. tourist allowance to Spain.  Wdn’t be 	popular here because Spain is so cheap.

             	x|	We shd. try to make Gib. less dependent on Spain – e.g. by 	more Service Expre. : more calls by naval &amp; merchant ships 	(Br. &amp; foreign) : bldg. of deep water wharf &amp; improved 	bunkering facilities.

	Can we go on with these?  Shd. we take more direct action v. Spain i.e. on tourist allowances.  I prefer x/.  Don’t rule out y/.



A.E.	V. diff. ques.  But mistake to threaten Spaniards with economic sanctions.  Go on with trade talks on merits.  But go on with x/.  We then show we are reasonable, but we are going to stay in Gib.  Keep the 2 things separate.  Second will cost less than losing our trade.



A.L.B.	Content to leave y/ until after trade talks.

	Want Cab. approval for x/.



Sal.	Tourist trade is small : £10 M : won’t make much diff. to Spain except to anger them.

	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



A.E.	



P.M.	We cd. nag at them about it.  



H.M. 	Will consider it.



R.A.B.	Ready to consider means of improving local situation.



A.L.B.	Parly. delegn. might go to Gib.

								[Enter S.Ll.



		6.	East-West Trade.



H.M.	Our aim is to stop export of i) scarce  ii) goods involvg. know-how  iii) direct mil. value.

	Copper.  Are to we to accept U.S. desire for embargo: or suggest quantitative limit.

	Purchase of wire for copper stock-pile (v. expensive method) suggests they are v. short of it.

	Since memo. some new developmts. in Paris Group. A global

                x|	quota is thght. likely to meet general views – around 10,000 tons.

	This is not a good moment to disagree with U.S.

	Not much in this from defence angle.  Turns on transhipment control on imports to R. from Chile – which is U.S. controlled.

	On balance, I advocate compromise at x/.



P.T.	V. diff. ques.  Diff. to defend embargo on copper on strategic grounds.

           y|	Can’t defend it in H/C. on other grounds.  Part of a v. recent bargain with U.S.

	Amounts.  Fr. Europe only 20,000 t.  U.S. uses 700,000 t. of wire : U.K. 150,000 t.

	Recognise U.S. feelings.

		i)	Try first to stop raw copper – of wh. 150, 000 t. is going to R. 			now.

			Transactn. control wd. help that : &amp; wd. really please U.S.

		ii)	Shipping, rolling mills &amp; copper are all at issue.  Cttee. of 

			Ministers shd. be re-convened to look at possibility of a

package settlement.

		iii)	Mtg. in Paris on Friday.  Suggest we say then : can’t go back to 			quota : 	but wd. be ready to fix a ceiling (global) – amount to be 			settled &amp; Ministers concerned.



A.E.	We alone oppose shipping agreemt.  We alone refuse to suspend export licences for copper-wire pro tem.

	Cd. we not agree to seek global total of 20,000 t. – and come down to 15,000.



P.T.	Repeat y/.



H.M.	We shd. try to link this with t’shipment &amp; transaction controls.



S.Ll.	Unless total is 20,000, U.K. will have no chance to get any of the business.

		

		Agreed :	B/T. to confer with Junior Ministers of Dpts.

concerned.



								[Exit S.Ll.



		7.	Formosa.



A.E.	Advise against procdg. with Oracle., in circs. described in memo.

	Believe N.Z. will agree.

	Reserve freedom to try Oracle later, if circs. become more favourable.



Sw.	Welcome this recommendation.



			Memo. approved.
