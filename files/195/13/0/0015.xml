C.1(55)								4th January, 1955



							[Enter S.Ll., G.Ll.,Att.G., B-C.



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



P.M.		Steps necessary if there is a strike – N.B.’s brief.



W.M.		Interim report of Ct. recd. at m’night y’day.

	Two principles :	i)	negotiating machinery shd. have bn. used.

		ii)	in a natd. industry fair wages shd. be paid.

	Ct. condemns N.U.R. for not accepting i), and B.T.C. for delay in negotns.

	Propose to publish this to-morrow : to send for parties to-morrow (noon) : urge NUR to raise strike &amp; resume negotns.

	Ct. recommend review of all wage rates, urgently &amp; w’out limitn. because of oblign. to “pay their way”.

	This may avert strike : it will restore confidence in collective bargaining.  Helpful tht. they have separated fair wage &amp; capacity to pay it.  Resumptn. at top level is helpful.  Somethg. that “merits re-considn.”.  Gives N.U.R. a chance of coming off their intransigent attitude.



A.E.	What will B.R. say?



W.M.	H’to he has bn. somewhat intransigent.



B.C.	Y’day he said – if Ct. recommended increases he wd. be ready to negotiate them if he got some public assurance re his statutory posn.



P.M.	I favoured direction to B.T.C. on that.  But B.R. indicated tht. he wd. not need formal direction : public assurance of Govt’s view wd. suffice.  Now told tht. B.R. wd. not welcome resumptn. of negotns. on that basis.  He didn’t want to be relieved of his statutory oblign., as argument in resisting wage claims.



W.M.	Read para. of Ct.’s report on this point.

	Diffy : there is no principle by wh. to determine what is a fair and reasonable wage.



A.E.	W.M. said at outset they weren’t underpaid relatively.  Now Press, &amp; Ct., is coming out the other way.



W.M.	It was my view.  But public &amp; responsible T.U.’s don’t take that view.  Court says, however, it merits re-considn., particularly in higher grades.  This implies tht. they haven’t so much sympathy for lowest-paid.

	All the facts available to me were put before the Court.



D.E.	It’s earnings, not basic rates, tht. shd. be compd.



B.C.	Many railwaymen do earn over-time.



W.M.	150/= to 182/= p.wk. is average earnings of lowest paid.



H.M.	N.U.R. developed a good case before the Court &amp; that captured public ear.  Showed incompetence of presentn. by B.T.C.



R.A.B.	x/	Must preserve basis of wage negotn.  That is cardinal.

		If we can resume negotn., strike notices w’drawn, there is a case for giving increased wages.  But claims are now under considn. from 7m workers.  Employers are much concerned about x/ : no negotn. under threat.

		Some general increase in wages is tolerable in view of boom condns.  On finance of rlways : must resist subsidy.  In view of modernisn. plans, dividend fr. man-power re-organisation – I see no difficulty in acceptg. larger deficit.  But wd. take no initiative myself.  And B.T.C. shd. come to us on this after a wage negotiation.  I rely for this on phrase “taking one year with another”.



Sal.		If we relax our view on stat. oblign., it is a concession to force.



R.A.B.		Ty, have always bn. ready to accept larger deficit.



Sal.		But Ct. have decided this shd. not be governing factor.  Public already take that view.

		Care to avoid making precedent.

		Final sentence of summary – will they w’draw notice w’out some promise or assurance of good outcome of negotns.



P.T.		Shall we not be asked Govt. view staty. oblign. to pay their way?



R.A.B. 		I wd. prefer tht. first statement shd. be from B.T.C. 



P.T.		We shan’t be ablt to avoid saying anything until then.  We shall have to say somethg. surely, on this point.



H.M.		B.T.C. will want Govt. statement before he resumes neogtns.



W.M.		Campbell also will want to know before he cancels strike notice.



H.M.		Stress man-power efficiency – to balance £1.000M. capital investment.



Sal.		What assurance of that?



H.M.  		Wd. prefer an enquiry.



R.A.B.		That’s why I wd. prefer at present to say only what we understand by oblign. under 3(4) of Act,. viz., up to 5 years or so.



K.		Yes : and wait for B.T.C. initiation on the re-organisn. plan etc.



S.Ll.		Fair &amp; reasonable wages must be related to financial condn. of rlways even tho’ you take a long view of that.



Sal.		Enough for M/L. to say : Govt. accept the report &amp; in our view it contains nothing inconsistent with existing law.
