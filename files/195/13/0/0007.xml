C.85(54)							13th December, 1954



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.		[Enter H. Brooke.



B.C.	Am seeing N.U.R. at 6 p.m.  They will ask me to put B.T.C. in posn. to pay higher wages.  R. has told me tht. on his own he can do nothg. substantial.

	Shall urge them to resume talks or go to arbn.  But they will say it’s useless.

	Courses	i)   Say we can do nothing.  Resume.

			ii)  Will consider : want 2-3 days for reflectn.

			iii) Say we will help B.T.C. to pay more.



W.M.	Over week-end 2 developments :



	a) interview with R. – Minute read.

	points in b) c) and d) are v. strong.  Buses &amp; mines.  Short truce : d)

	b) strike wd. not be called until after Xmas.

	Therefore I prefer course ii), adding tht. Govt. wd. in no circs. give a subsidy.

	Advise them to resume : they haven’t exhausted negotns. nor arbitration : promise to consider what they say &amp; communicate with them but no subsidy.  Make the point that wages must have some relation to industry’s earnings.

	Sympathy now wd. be out of place : for i) wd. take it out of B.T.C. hands into Govt’s ii) their wages don’t compare too ill with others.

	Early election wd. make unwise settlement more tolerable (!).  Our sin wd. not pursue us so long.



B.C.	R. wants early decision, for fear of local strikes wh. mght force Union’s hand.



W.M.	Subsidy – wd. be unpalatable to conservative opinion in T.U.C.



P.M.	No real diffce. betwn. subsidy and larger deficit.



H.B.	Support M/L. line.  Wd. want firm statement : no subsidy.  Ty. is not technically responsible for B.T.C. deficit.  They shd. not be asked to guarantee it.



A.L.B.	Concessions now will not bring peace.  Public statement tht. B.T.C. “need not trouble themselves about size of deficit” wd. be equivalent of subsidising wage increase.

	Weakness wd. undermine R.’s position &amp; authy.



Sal.	W’out some assurance of greater efficiency of labour, concession wd. be regarded as a “sell-out”.



B.C.	Since promise of last Oct., somethg. has bn. done by the men – but not enough.

W.M.	Redundancy of at least 10,000.  Means £2½ M. p.a. or more.



J.S.	Don’t believe we have power to direct B.T.C. to accept increased deficit.



B.C.	R. wd. act w’out discn., if public statement were made of Govt.’s view.



A.E.	But that is indistinguishable from subsidy.



Sw.	Shd. we treat this as ordinary industry?  Must it not be subsidised, as agricultural wages are?

	Wd. it not be logical to pay – but on condn. i) modernisation ii) efficiency.  

We can’t afford a strike.



P.M.	Cost of a strike wd. be much greater than any sum needed to finance this claim for higher wage.  Effect on economy.



H.M.	i) What is M/T. to say?  Surely W.M.’s line is enough for that.

	Tho’ put subsidy point as “no subsidy to wages.”

	ii) On bigger issue : to avert strike at this time of year (if you play for a show-down, seek it in summer).  Avoid another wage cycle.  Try to isolate rlways.  Deficit (a loan, not a gift) : not a fixed amount, a moving figure affected by capital receipts (sale of lorries etc.,)

	Differentiation : damaged during war : we await modernn. plans.

             x|		£3-4 m. saving possible by man-power efficiency.

	Surely by reliance on x/ we cd. justify larger deficit m’while.

	On modernisation plan, if men decline co-opn., we mght have to force a show-down.  Then we cd. choose the time.



H.B.	Conceivable that deficit mght be written off or funded, at time of making a fresh start on “modernisation”.



A.E.	Support W.M.’s line.  That is enough pro. tem.

	Increasg. deficit is not easy.  Happened last year.  But promised improvement has not materialised.  Consequences of appearing to do this year what we did last year.

	Public Govt. statement on lines of M/T. minute wd. be v. dangerous.  Sooner or later we shall have to w’stand one or other of the natd. indies.



J.S.	“Direction”.  Not much better if we have to make it publicly clear tht. we support increased deficit.

	Support A.E.’s doubts.



P.T.	Impd. by R.’s b-d.

Wd. help on stage 2 if we knew what R.’s modernn. plans are.  Cdn’t we get an outline now.



W.	I doubt if they will strike.  Manchr group is left-wing – but will they carry others with them?



W.M. }	The Union is weak.  There is a risk of a strike.

B.C.   }	But we ought to accept that risk.



H.B.	Say no subsidy – not no subsidy to wages.  For we wdn’t subsidise fares increased to finance increased wages.



K.	Can’t give direction re increased deficit.  Don’t think it legal to relieve B.T.C. of duty to make rlways pay.

	What sort of statement wd. we make?  The Govt. think B.T.C. wd. be justified in takg. long-term view of oblign. to make rlways pay – on grounds i) new charges scheme ii) modernisation plan (Govt. will consider with care) iii) greater &amp; more urgent co-opn. in proper deploymt. of labour force.

	If we said that, cd. we isolate this as rlway problem alone?  We shd. look closely at that.  Not, I think, impossible.



Sw.	Can’t we work this out m’while?



H.C.	Another concession by Govt. will lose us much political credit.  I believe we suffered politically from last years’ concession.

	Can’t we avoid repayment of tax during strike?  Shd. we not consider that, even tho’ legn. is involved.



Sal.	Cd. we differentiate, on this, betw. official and unofficial strike?

	Cd. we get rid of idea tht. all wages shd. be the same?

		2.	Housing.					[Enter Maudling



D.S.	I agreed, in Cab., to work twds target of 140,000 allocations.  I then pointed out pol. dangers.  Agreed tht. it shd. be adminve. – w’out publicity.  But now 8 P.Q.’s and D. Herald.

	Propose to answer P.Q.’s in terms of draft circulated.

	May I  also make statements in a)-d) of notes for supplementaries.  Cuts in allocns. affect 1956, not 1955.

	Finally, if asked directly “is it our policy to cut l.a. housebuilding?”, what am I to say?  Truth is “yes”.  But, if I say so, I will wreck our achievement to-date.



J.S.	“M’tain it at a level wh. economy will support.”?



M.	Plans for other investment, &amp; for Budget, depend on redn. in subsidised housing.



H.M.	Socialists never built more than 150,000.  We shall be bldg 190,000.

	Avoid any clear promise or threat, for future.



D.S.	Even statement tht. we shall build more than Labour ever did will imply we are cutting back our p’mme.



H.M.	Eventually, cost shd. be reduced by cutting subsidy.  But not until after election.  That will reduce nos. desired by l.a.’s.



A.L.B.	Add to answer nos. to be built in ’56.  Then refuse to look further ahead.
