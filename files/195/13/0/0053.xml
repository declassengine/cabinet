C.M.11(55)							2nd June, 1955



[Enter G.Ll., B-C., Ch.Hill, H.B.,  B-H.



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	B’down on S’day was due to N.U.R. – who demanded by midnight “consequential” rises for all their grades save basic.

	Aslef are now hoping to get better offer &amp; to decline to talk in assocn. with N.U.R.

	B.T.C. attitude changed in last 48 hrs.  Previously – got to come sooner or later : then – ready to pay a little more to avert it.

	Now there is no prospect of early move.  We must wait.



B.C.	B.T.C. were ready for small concessions via classificn. of drivers.  They still think that wd. be best.  But realise Aslef wdn’t have it.  They wd. therefore share the £½ M. by diff. means acceptable to Aslef.  But not while a strike is on.  NUR equally oppose classificn.



P.M.	Want main issue kept before public.  Govt. offered Bd. of Conciliation.  But way of ending this is for men to accept that offer, calling off strike m’while.  Keep emphasising that – offer made &amp; still open.



W.M.	Save that parties may come close enough together for M/L. to devise formula wh. will enable strike to be called off &amp; negotns. resumed.



W.	Who wd. be “conciliator”.  Men mght prefer to talk to “rlwaymen” vice B.T.C. This is suggested to me.  May be sign of weakness.



W.M.	It’s men, not Executive, who favour strike.

	I had in mind Morris L.J. – who has respect of workers.  But he wd. need assessors with knowledge of rlways.



H.C.      x/	Why not nominate them now &amp; indicate they are available as soon as strike is called off.



W.M.	Will make submn. to P.M. – on names.



H.M.     y/	Make it clear also tht. no settlement wd. do wh. didn’t include relative NUR grades.  Settlement must therefore embrace both Unions.



P.M.	Govt. statement today.  i) answering Batey’s claim tht. it isn’t an inter-Union dispute.  ii) offer of Bd. of Conciliation is still open.  iii) warning of long-term effects on industry.



L.P.	In order i) (iii) ii) and then add x/.



G.Ll.	Include in iii) effects on coal-stocks next winter wh. may effect employmt.



P.M.	In addn. I mght b’cast e.g. on Monday.



		Ascot.



		Agreed : recommend tht. it shd. be reduced to level of July or Sept. 		mtg. viz., no “Royal” Ascot.



	Insurance cards.  O.P. &amp; W.. to consider wtr strikers shd. be refused “temporary cards”.





		2.	Industrial Disputes : General.



W.M.	May I take informal soundings.  T.U.C. and B.E.C. members have bn. in touch privately : and B.E.C. will be telling me the upshot.

	Cab. can therefore have fuller discn. later on.

	Outlined diffies. of various courses of action.

	Recommend considn. by independent Cttee. in first instance.



		Agreed :  resume discn. on Tuesday next.



							[Exit Ch. Hill.



		3.	Queen’s Speech.



		Draft considered and amended.

		B/T. to submit memo. on Monopolies, incldg. memo. by Galbraith.



			L.P. &amp; P.M. to settle final text.	





		4.	Legislative Programme.



H.C.	General approval ? – for major Bills.

	Authy. to re-introduce the “innocents”.





		5.	Kenya.						[Exit B.H.



ALB.	Govr’s recommn. strongly supported by C-in-C.

	Indicns. of split among terrorists.  War Council think tht. warning now on lines proposed will accelerate collapse of rebellion.

	Discussed this with Ld. Ch. &amp; Att.G.  Forfeiture has bn. in opern. already in respect of named land : this wd. go to their rights to hold land in future &amp; wd. therefore apply to young rebels who haven’t yet held land.



P.M.	Ready to agree to w’drawal of offer.  But land proposal will create new bitterness.



A.L.B.	Provision to revoke the order after good behaviour.



P.M.	Will cause criticism here?



L.P.	Will it be effective if it’s realised tht. it will be revoked later, when trouble dies away?



A.L.B.	Told Govr. tht. Advisory Cttee. shd. be strengthened &amp; empowered to say, in need, tht. they recommended contrary to a decn. of Govr.



P.M.	A howl of criticism here will reduce its effectiveness in Kenya.



H.M.	Cd. it be a disqualification for a period of years?



A.L.B.	A less effective deterrent.



P.M.	Surely intensificatn. of mil. opns. (i.e. fear of death) is stronger deterrent.



K.	Unless we can show tht. these men are liable to death penalty, &amp; tht. forfeiture of land is therefore a lesser penalty, this wd. be inconsistent with Human Rights Convention.



ALB.	Europ. Ministers feel so strongly in favour of this that some may resign if it’s not authorised.



H.M.	Wd. accept forfeiture of existing possession of land or right to share in tribal land.



A.L.B.	Can I say we are ready to agree to forfeiture of existg rights (individual or tribal share).



P.M.	Inform Govr. tht. he may w’draw surrender offer on named date, but we must have more time to consider (reduced) sanctions re land.





		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	Bd. of Conciliation cannot, I find, be appointed w’out consent.  I can’t therefore announce names at risk of rebuff.
