C.8(55)								31st January, 1955



									[Enter B.H.

		1.	Treatment of Br. Prisoners by Chinese.



A.E.	Have asked Sec. Genl. U.N. if publn. wd. embarrass him.  He says not.

	Shd. we publish it?  If now – this week (or in 10 days) – it will be said why do this when you are trying to get Chinese to U.N. discussions.



B.H.		Wish to publish – but not at this moment.

						Defer (decision) for 2 weeks.





		2.	Formosa.



A.E.	Russian move has caused a no. of mtgs in N. York.  Don’t exclude possibility tht. it may be intended to be helpful – i.e. to provide Chinese with excuse for attending.

	Compromise (UK., U.S., N.Z. &amp; Fr) – both items to be accepted on agenda – priority given to N.Z. item &amp; any invitn. issued to Peking to-day wd. be based on that.  But R. item wd. remain on agenda.



P.M.	Impressed by Molotov’s remark – need be no fighting over a w’drawal.



A.E.	Discn. in Sec. Council likely to go on for some days.  We must therefore consider what we do if we can’t get a result there.  A suggn. (in telegram form) has bn. handed round.

	Only chance of world agreement is for U.S. to revert to Truman doctrine – i.e. abandon use of F. as base for offensive action – as well as w’drawal of Nationalist from coastal islands.  Can’t however expect Ike to do this at once.

	Canadians fear tht. U.S. will be isolated before world opinion if they don’t define more clearly their attitude on coastal islands &amp; use of Formosa.



R.A.B.	Are paras. 7 and 11 consistent?  What posn. do we want them to take?



H.M.	Para 11 – also a strong case on human, as well as juridical, aspect.

	Cd. you add that – refce.to abandoning Chang’s men to their fate.



P.M.	I have suggested to A.E. a possible line which U.S. might take.

	I fear U.S. getting into posn. of humiliation : they can’t be expected to accept appearance of defeat by Chinese.



A.E.	May I consider incorporatg. this idea into my draft.



Sal.	Don’t put analogy of Gib. &amp; Cyprus (para. 11).  Make the point more generally.



*	Wd. F.O. circulate a note on juridical position of Formosa.

A.E.		Yes.





		3.	Thermo-Nuclear Weapons.



H.M.		May I announce the decn. (to produce H-bomb) to 4 old Doms. at restricted mtg on Defence on Tues. p.m.



P.M.	Certainly.  We have (Def. Cttee.) decided to publish it to the world – in or in connn. with Defence White Paper.



			Agreed.





		4.	External Trade &amp; Payments.



A.E.		Para 4. – exp’re. is rising faster than incomes.



R.A.B.		E.P.C. will be making another review in 3 wks. or so : &amp; we will let Cabinet have another report.

		Diffy. about coal.  Our exports are being cut because of shortage.

		Reserves : this month we have struck “even”.

		Bank rates rise has already had good effect (para. 6).

	Shall have to examine measures to improve overseas balance – we have bn. led by prosperity to import too much.



							[Enter H.W. &amp; B.C.

	5.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Draft statement – compromise, as basis for discussion.

	Lancs. won’t like	i)	promise (undated) to admit J. in future.  But we cdn’t say less.

		ii)	offer to give M.F.N. treatment on tariffs to J.  This wd. bind tariff.  Comment in para 2 : means dealing with counter-vailing – legn. – this year.

	x|	Tokyo tel. 38. I cd. accept Dening’s last 4 lines.  Or you can have a 

	  |	better form of words of mine.  A.E. can chose.

		If Cab. approve in principle, we cd. ask Menzies &amp; Holland what they propose.  Believe they are thinking along v. similar lines.



A.E.		Will be a blow to Japan – who are key to posn. in F/E.

		Tokyo 38.	i)	no announcemt. until after 27/2.  Genl. Election

				in Japan.				Agreed.

			ii)	advance commn., in due course, to Jap. P.M.

									Agreed.

			iii)	As at x/ above.

					Approved.

					Talk to A &amp; N.Z.

					Officials (O.N.C.) to consider timing

					(subject to no announcemt. before 27/2)



							[Enter Att.G. &amp; G.Ll.

		6.	Railways.



		(Not heard).





		7.	Parliament.



H.C.		Kitchen Cttee. has made a profit this year.  Triumph for conservative good management.

		Coloured immigrants.  Party Cttee. were against Osborne’s project.  and he i) is ill &amp; ii) has agreed to drop it.



ALB.		Bad timing qua Jamaica – Manley : tercentenary : Princess Margaret’s visit.

		We cd. warn Doms. P.M.’s that we may have to pass legn. which will, in form, apply to their people.



A.E.		Need for early action remains.



H.C.		Business for next week.

		Cocos Islands (Transfer) Bill.  2nd Rdg. to-day.  Labour have got to know tht.  Austr. won’t allow Cocos Islanders admn. to Australia.  Immigration of coloured people may therefore be raised to-day.



							[Exit H.W., B-C., A.L.B., O.P.



		8.	Fog.



D.S.		What line shall I take when Nabarro’s Bill comes fwd. on Friday.

		I made statement authd. by Cabinet.

		We can now		i)	do nothing.  Bill will then go thro’ – bad &amp; incomplete: &amp; wd. cause confusion among l.a.’s

					ii)	help Nabarro to make his Bill effective.  Awkward.  Insertion of financial provns. in Private Members’ Bill wd. be dangerous precedents.  Also v. complicated amendmt. wd. be needed – prob. after Cttee. stage, for we wdn’t be ready earlier to bring 

	x|	fwd. our amendments, since our discns. with ???? &amp; industry are procdg.

					iii)	tell H/C. tht. Govt. are framing legn. to give effect to principles of Beaver Cttee. Rpt.  But we must first complete x/.  Therefore, no promise of date : but certainly not before Easter.  Ques wtr it can pass this session will depend on wtr it proves agreed measure &amp; on wtr diffies. appear during consultns. now current.



B.H.		On a statement as in (iii), Nabarro wd. w’draw his Bill.



Sal.		In v. general form I wd. accept this.  But let us say “progressive” fulfilment of these recommns.  Sulphur, e.g., is worst evil : and remedies for that are v. expensive – even if practicable .



D.S.		Don’t intend to say any more now on merits – only legn.



											[Exit G.Ll., B.H.

		9.	Western European Union : Privileges.



A.E.		Seek agreemt. in principles to concede to these in Ldn. what is granted to N.A.T.O. people in Ldn.



H.C.		Parly. difficulties.



			Approved.
