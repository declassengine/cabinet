C.79(54)							24th November, 1954



		1.	Cyprus.				[Enter de L., P.B-H.



A.E.	Informn. tht. Gk. Govt. have armed a caique to start insurrection in Cyprus – to-night.

	Govr. alerted – will try to catch them.





		2.	Parliament.



P.M.	Raised with C.R.A. ques of an understanding re defence.  Indicated my wish to speak on 6/12 and offered to let him know in advance substance of my speech.

	He welcomed this: and recognised need for some things to be left unsaid.

	Mght also be opportunity to consult Eis. in advance.



A.E.	N.A.T.O. mtg. cd. be made excuse for not saying more.



P.M.	In this event I wd. open &amp; H.M. wd. reply to debate.

	I wd. hope then to keep bi-partisan approach to defence.



H.C.	If that wd. extend debate/Address, we might (having offered it) be forced to do it before 6/12.



J.S.	Will CRA do it, on reflection?  He might split his Party.  H.M. may advise him in that sense.



De L.	I wd. have to tell A.A.F. before announcement.



H.M.	Shd. these announcements be made in yr. speech, or in advance of it?



P.M.	I don’t want to make them.  



A.E. 	Don’t do it far in advance.



P.M.	Then it can be announced on 6/12.



H.C.	What of their amendment.  Must be debated on last day.



P.M.	Talk to Opposn. and see what they think.



B.H.	They won’t talk before they have seen the Speech.



H.C.	And if we have to concede another day to D/Address we jeopardise the Pensions Bill.



Sw.	Detailed announcements on A.A. &amp; A.A.F. shd not precede the general statement.  Shd. follow, even on same day. 



Sal.	We are negotiating our agreemt. on exchange of a. informn. U.S. mil. authies. are sticky.  Full exposn. of our attitude twds A. war wd. be a little delicate.



P.M.	But. v. inconven. not to be able to place specific measures v. b’ground of a general design.



H.C.	My diffy. (re Pensions Bill) wd. not arise if defence cd. be discussed on the Thursday.



P.M.	Diff. for me to be ready by then.  Might wish to consult Eisenhower.

	But I wd. be ready to try to do it by then.



H.M.	Friday?	



H.C. 	Not a good day.  Also Phillips Rpt. will come then.



H.C.	May I talk – bearing in mind that P.M. wd. prefer to

	make a statement on Defence on Mon., but wd. be

	ready if need be to make it on Thursday.



P.M.	Then I wd. announce the specific measures in course of

	my statement.

								[Exit B.H.



		3.	Foreign Affairs.



		a)	Saar.



A.E.	Fear  Mendes-France may have made concessions to G. wh. he won’t be able to get Fr. Parlt. to endorse.  May get into trouble again over this.



		b)	S.E.A.



	Can’t form Govts. in Viet Nam, Laos &amp; Cambodia.  Their only inheritance from the French!  Leaves all open for Communists.

	U.S. wdn’t admit P.M. to their talks on this with M. France.

	Proposing tri-partite discns. in W’ton.



		c)	Quemoy.



	We awaited U.S. draft Treaty.  Wanted it clear tht. F. wdn’t be sanctuary : &amp; tht. Ch. Nat. wdn’t attack inshore islands.  But despite U.S. assurances, documents are silent on these points.

	Statement, for publicn. 30/xi, meets neither point.  Haven’t any hope there will be definite assurances on these ques in exchange of notes.  This will increase, vice lessen, tension.

	Shall ask Dulles for amendmt. to bring out these points.

	Tel. read : in draft.



P.M.	Support A.E. in his endeavours.



Sw.	Shd. you include refce. to Nehru.



A.E.	Don’t think Dulles will be upset by this.  Nehru’s reaction was quite sensible.





		4.	Sale of Arms to M/East.



A.E.	Have met earlier this p.m.

	All turns on Fr. delivery of Mystere aircraft to Israel.  We must know if they are sending 24 (12 now : 12 later).  This wd. put Israel in clear superiority &amp; wd. prompt Arab demands for Sabres etc.

	Propose therefore to raise it in W’ton Cttee. : &amp; say, if these are going, we must give Egypt Vampire aircraft they ordered.  At same time, private approach to French.  Meteors cd. then be spread over ’55.

	Best we can do.

	But, if Fr. do this, U.S. are sure to give Arabs some Sabres.

	Telegram agreed with M/Defence.





		5.	Atomic Energy.



Sal.	New a. trials in Austr.  Permanent site desired by us.  Austr. has agreed tht. experts shd. prospect for suitable site.  Due to leave soon.  But identity is known in Austr. &amp; arrival shd. therefore be announced.

	Will come out Thursd. pm. here.

	Read terms.



S.Ll.	Austr. Govt. have agreed.



A.E.	More trouble if we don’t make such an announcemt.





		Approved.
