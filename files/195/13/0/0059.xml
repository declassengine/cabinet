C.M.17(55)							23rd June, 1955



		1.	Parliament.			[Enter B.H., Reading., Att.G.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Austrian Treaty Bill – 29/6.		[Enter de L., C.A.S.





		2.	Cyprus.



ALB.	Disturbances.  Govr. may have to arrest Archbishop.



P.M.        x/	Awkward to produce our new plan while state of emergency exists.



A.L.B.	Govr. is staying in Nicosia.



S.Ll.	Report on x/ by end of next week.





		3.	Aden Protectorate.



A.L.B.	Most urgent need : enquiry into organisation of security forces.

	M’while go fwd. with raising extra levies : immediate provn. of armoured cars.

	Para 7 of t. of r. w’draw (ii).  F.O. are not keen on this.  I was ready to wait while revolt in Yemen continued.  But now it’s clear tht. Imam is firmly in saddle &amp; supporting rebels in Protectorate.  And I want to give him some of his own medicine.  Wish therefore to authorise Govr./Aden to submit plans for this.

	Also seek authy. for exp’re as in para 10(i).

	These immediate steps are necessary to restore our damaged prestige.



R.A.B.	Accept recommn. in para 10, subject to normal financial consents.

	You can’t deal with these activities from air, or in land-rovers.  Need for armoured vehicles.  This shd. be faced.

	Need is for prompt &amp; vigorous action.



S.Ll.	Shd. refce. be made in Cab. pp. to counter-subversionary measures?

	Military side : short-term and long.  The second needs more consideration.



de L.	Support C.O. proposals for measures other than military – wh. won’t alone suffice.

	Don’t send more U.K. troops.  Air control is more economical.



C.A.S.	Short-term.  My conclusion : Fort Rabat is besieged. ⅔rds of Rabizi have submitted to truce.  But commando force of about 100 is v. active, well supplied, &amp; threateng. morale of whole Protectorate.  An operation is now being mounted v. this force w’in next few days.

	We need money to bribe people who cd. clean up these malcontents.  Wd. be effective at this stage.



P.M.	In discns. on Canal, I suggd. tht. some armour might go fr. there to Aden.  To think that 100 men with rifles can overset our whole Adminn.

	I distrust air control – doubt if it is effective.  Hope there will be

          x/	early enquiry on spot by soldier &amp; airman.  Wd. prefer to have their report before addl. levies are raised.

	Propose that M/D. &amp; A.L.B. go into long-term issues, consultg. with C.O.S. who will, I trust, adopt method at x/.

	Cd. operation be deferred m’while?



C.A.S.	No : for men in fort must be relieved.



P.M.	Money can be made available.  “Bis dat”.



C.A.S.	Only r. suitable type of armoured car = Ferret.  These aren’t available in area.  There are some, less suitable, in Canal.

	Situation has changed because of organised opns. mounted from Yemen.  We wd. now like armoured cars.



S.Ll.	1.150 Levies.  Shd. be enough force, if properly used.



C.A.S.	Tho’ they are v. tired – over-work.



P.M.      y|	Shd. there not be some re-inforcemt., with appropte. armour, while addl. Levies are being raised?  



C.A.S. 	May I consult C.I.G.S. on that.



P.M.	Approve these proposals, but y/ shd. be considered.

	{Let M/D get on rapidly with long-term enquiry.

	{I will settle counter-subversionary moves with ALB &amp; H.M.



		Memo. to be recalled.



S.Ll.	Repns. to Yemen?



R.	We are considering.  Also considering asking King of Jordan to warn him he will get rough treatment.



S.Ll.	Iraq too.  They wd. have more influence.



CAS.	Also a note?					[Exit de L., C.A.S.

							[Enter G.Ll., B.C.









		4.	Coal Prices.



G.Ll.	Increase is large.  This, however, is moment to do necessary but disagreeable things.

	It wd. be wrong, while coal is scarce, to supply it at subsidised price.

	This is connd. with supply problems.  Want to show support of N.C.B.  We have re-organised Bd., &amp; new Bd. have adopted all Fleck recommns.  This in spite of diffy. of dealing with men.

	Consistent with switch to oil.



R.A.B.	Discussed in E.P.C. with Ministers involved.

	Inevitable tht. we shd. agree now to N.C.B.’s wish to raise prices.

	We are becoming a net importer of coal!  Exports will drop to 5 m tons : &amp; we shall import 12 m.  Heavy cost to b/payments esp. as some will have to be bought in dollars.

	Coal is therefore major economic problem of our time.

	Commend 20% increase.  Means only 1% on our export prices.  Good effect on economy of allowg. price mechanism to work.  Increased coal prices will help to reduce infl. pressure.

	Good therefore, not only for coal industry, but for natl. economy as a whole.

	Will raise c/l. index by 1 point only.

	18% is not enough : it wd. leave deficit in ’56.

	20% wd. mean that it need not come up again too soon.



W.	This will encourage economy in industrial use, for wh. there is room.

	This    ..         ..        switch to oil in industry, which must come.

	In full employmt., miners can do as they please : &amp; we shall have to reduce our dependence on them.

	Favour 20% increase.  For N.C.B. mght then in 18 mos. be able to reduce prices.



W.M.	Accept need, reluctantly, for some increase.

	But is it wise to budget for net surplus of £20 M. in ’56.  Miners’ leaders notice this &amp;  may demand wage increase.

	Increased c/living will affect all wage claims.

	18% wd. yield + £10 M. in ’56.  I favour 18%.



Sal.	Alternative fuels.  G.Ll. mentioned possibility of acceleratg. civil p’mme of atomic energy.  Ready to consider privately : but don’t want it mentioned publicly.  Doubt if acceleration is possible, or desirable.  We learn as we build : unwise therefore to build several at once.



G.Ll.	Even with 18% increase our coal will be cheaper than European.



H.	Differential, tho’ not increased, will bear more hardly on some industries e.g. steel in Scotland.



G.Ll.	That policy did bear hardly on Scottish steel.  N.C.B. will discuss this with interests specially affected.



B.C.	This will cost rlways another £9 M. – will double their present deficit.  Will bring nearer the day for increased fares.



O.P.	Complacency of N.C.B.  Report for ’54 gave no suggn. tht. there is a problem.

	Estimate for ’56 is now £40 M. worse than it was 3 months ago.  Isn’t that disturbing?

	We must increase prices.  Don’t want, however, to accept their figures or to budget for surplus in ’56.  Their accumulated deficit is v. small in reln. to turnover.  No more than their annual allowance for depreciation.



P.M.	Must be an increase.  18% or 20%.  Wd. favour 18% if I was assured tht. it wd. hold posn. for 18 mos.  But, if there is risk of that, wd. prefer to do 20% now.



P.T.	Wd. sooner do 20% and stand to it.



W.	NCB cd. reduce prices at any time if they saw “risk” of surplus.



H.A.	Will cost £1 M. extra for trawlers – involvg. increased subsidy.  Favour 18%.  Looks less resounding.



		After further discussion :  Agreed : 18% increase.



								[Enter Att.G.



		5.	Industrial Disputes : Ocean Liners.



W.M.	Yates as well as Geddes has spoken &amp; Wigg M.P. has now w’drawn P.Q. he was to have asked, on call-up point.

	Not anxious to say tht. engaged seaman has no right to strike.  But it seems that he has no such right.



								[Exit B.C., G.H.



		

6.	Administration Tribunals.



K.	Avoid droit administratif.

	Chairman : Radcliffe or Parker.

	Membership : on analogy of Donoughmore.  Leading C. Servants don’t want to be members : prefer to give evidence.



D.S.	We have 600 comp. purchase orders, and 5.000 planning decns. each year.  Procedure is already slow.  Cab. shd. realise tht. “reform” will make it slower.  These decisions are not judiciable issues, but ques of policy.

	May I suggest to Ld. Chanc. some addl. ques if t. of r. set out ques..   E.g. distinction betwn. planning appeals &amp; purchase orders.

	Composition : right absence of officials.  Cttee. shd. know facts – and mayn’t get them by evce. alone.  If no civil servant, then no repve. of l.a., who are much more interested parties.  I wd. prefer both.  Need T.U.C. be on?



		Agreed :  Resume discussion on Tuesday.



								[Exit Att.G.



		7.	Remuneration of Ministers.



		Agreed – Cab. Cttee. to be appointed.

									[Enter J.T.



		8.	South Africa : Defence Talks.



S.Ll.	Erasmus wants to report at once to his Govt.

	Simonstown – 3 yrs or 1.  We can reach agreemt. on compromise.

	Naval agreemt. £18 M. of orders – binds S.A. Navy to ours for all time.

	M/E. can’t get firm commitment.  But staff talks.

	S. Afr. Defence : they are pressing for this.

	What shd. we do?  We can get Sim. &amp; Naval Agreemt. with staff talks on M/E.  Shall we try for that, &amp; leave over M/E commitment &amp;  S.A. Defence until later?  Or leave it all open?  I recommend getting Sim. &amp; N. Agreemt. now.



P.M.	M/E. commitment is not worth much.  They will decide on their own interest, one way or another, when time comes.  Secret staff talks will be, realistically, almost as good.

	I wd. concentrate on Sim. – get it as good as we can.  It is better now.  S.A. readiness to develop another base, to ensure room for us, is a plus.  But get safeguards re colour if we can.  App. A.  Annex C.(vii) is preferable to 9(a) of first Annex.



S.Ll.	Prefer “there shd. be no bar to recruitment of non-Europ.” when requd. – in 9(a).



J.T.	9(a) refers to new entrants.  (vii) in Ann. C. applies to existg. hands.



A.L.B.	Or add “or recruitment” to (b).



S.Ll.	They wd. want to choose a white man for particular jobs.  But I will see what we can do, in light of discussion.



R.A.B.	Cd. we also get a refce. to use of other ports in war?



S.Ll.	Impossible.  He won’t have it included in this.
