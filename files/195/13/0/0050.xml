W.M.	Then you shd. see B.T.C. first.



R.A.B.	And include in statement some reference to that?



W.M.	Let T.U.C. have a go first.  P.M. see them this p.m.

P.M.	Chambers’ Cttee. recommns.?



B.C.	Large no. of detailed recommns. now under considn. with B.T.C.  Rpt. has bn. publd. : but not ready to make statement as to its acceptance.  I will put out what I can : but it is v. much nuts and bolts.  

	B.T.C. will bring out the £15 M. economies on man-power.



		3.	Pensions : [Dependent] Parents.		[Exit B.C.  Ll.G.



O.P.	Pensions for sons killed in war.  Was flat-rate, but since 1922 have bn. on basis of need.  Maximum has not bn. raised since war.

	These are not easily defensible but have emotional appeal.

	They are constantly re-assessed on means &amp; any increase in other pension rates involves re-assessment.

	Compromise discussed with R.A.B. wd. have bn. enough; but in electoral atmosphere it won’t do.  Problem : find solution w’out prescribing disregard of N.I. pension (because of repercussion on Assistce.) .  No more re-assessments are being made now.  Propose to adopt a higher means standard – from 50/= to 60/=.   Wd. cost £200,000. 1952
