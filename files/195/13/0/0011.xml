		1.	Parliamentary Constituencies.		[Enter B-H., H.Brooke.



K.	Read lr. from Att. G.  Applying that injunction be discharged.  Believe Roxburgh J. had no jurisdn.  Shall seek to establish that &amp; also tht. no evce. tht. B. Commm. acted wrongly.  	Unlikely to end before to-morrow.

	May be appln. to go to H/L.  That might not be determined until Jany.

	Att. Genl. expects to win.  If so, by 4 p.m. Tues., he advises us to go on with Orders before appln. made for leave to appeal to H/L.



P.M.	Agree we shd. not proceed in Parlt. while Ct. of Appeal is considerg. this.  Shd. we go on immediately afterwards?



Ll.G.	Real urgency was Ldn., &amp; that is approved.  We cd. therefore wait for the remainder until New Year.  As soon as appeal is settled we cd. submit to Queen the Orders already approved.



Sal.	All the Orders have bn. passed by H/L. in administrative capacity. Awkward if H/L. has to review them in judicial capacity.

	The Orders passed by both Houses are to come to Privy Council to-morrow.



O.P.	Proposal to substitute debate on Nat. Assistance Regns.  This was announced for Tuesday.  Now to be put on to-day.  Was intended to last only 6 hrs.  Pity to give Oppn. 1½ days in which to wail about this.



H.C.	Spoke to C.R.A. y’day, intimating tht. they wd. come on Monday.  Oppn. are ready to start it to-day, and to go on until 7 p.m.



P.M.	Not impressed by O.P.’s argument.  Public won’t be influenced by debate in H/C.



H.C.	Adjourning H/C.



K.	We shd. not submit any Orders to Privy Council before Ct. Appeal decision.  Might involve Queen.



Sal.	I agree.



P.M.	On form of statement – must assert rights of Parlt.



Sal.	Not too soon.  Let Ct. of Appeal say Judge was wrong.  For we happen to be assisted politically by these orders.







		2.	Cyprus.



A.L.B.	P.Q. (Turton) on U.N. vote.  Private Notice Ques (to me) wh. I will answer on basis only of events w’in island – not Grk. aspects.  There may be debate on adjournment : then I wd. have to answer on both aspects.

	Sitn. this a.m. is steady.
