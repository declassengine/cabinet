C.M.10(55)							27th May, 1955



		1.	Election.		           [Enter G.Ll., B-C., B.H., Ch. Hill.



P.M.	Gratitude to colleagues for their efforts.  Esp. to W., as Chairman – v. efficient organisation.



H.M.	Apprecn. for P.M.’s leadership.





		2.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	Little prospect of averting strike.

	Aslef claim was for restorn. of differential – w’out joint discn. with

x|	NUR, who have members in these grades.  NUR dissented &amp; said, if any concession made, they wd. claim more : &amp; if their claim succeeded Aslef wd. come again.

	This is therefore in essence dispute betwn 2 Unions.  T.U.C. so regard it.  All efforts to bring 2 Unions together have failed.

	Tried to-day to get them to consider Bd. of Conciliation – viz., assisted negotns.  B.T.C. wd. have agreed.  Aslef have rejected it, despite efforts of T.U.C.

	T.U.C. are exploring other possibilities.  But I’m sure strike can’t be averted w’out some cash offer.  And tht. wd. bring into opn. the cycle at x/.

	NUR are resolved to defeat this strike.  But it might last : it is official, the prescribed procedures have bn. observed, they have funds.



P.M.	We can’t start our new period of office by giving way on this.  Compromises wd. be more dangerous than immediate results of strike.

	My only doubt is wtr I shd. see T.U.C.



W.M.	Objns. (not decisive) :	i) Unions are acting officially.  T.U.C. won’t discuss merits.		ii) T.U.C. are responsible for any misunderstandings about formula – wh. has given rise to charges of breaches of faith.  	iii) Don’t want to suggest T.U.C. is negotiating organ of Govt.



R.A.B.	Be firm.  But good if we can show we have done all that’s possible.



P.M.	Consequences will be serious.



R.A.B.	Incldg. effect on confidence in sterling.



W.M.	Argument v. P.M. seeing Aslef &amp; B.T.C. – i) mustn’t open regular “appeal” to P.M.  ii) mustn’t make N.U.R. think concession is likely to be offered.



		Measures to m’tain essential services.





		3.	Opening of Parliament.



		Agreed – bring date forward to 10/6.

			   don’t go back to 14/6, if strike collapses.

		Announce – after Council 31/5.

		Consult Opposn.





		4.	Queen’s Speech.



R.A.B.	How much positive on home-front ques? Other than Gowers Rpt.?  Cab : Thursday p.m.





		5.	Kenya.



A.L.B.	Will submit to P.M. plans re w’drawal of surrender offer, unless it can wait for Thursday’s Cab.

	In any event I will circulate memo. for Thursday’s Cab.
