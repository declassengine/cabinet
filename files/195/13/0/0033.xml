C.19(55)							2nd March, 1955



		1.	Formosa.			[Enter B.H., R., A.N., I.Kirkp.



P.M.	Relieved that A.E. has promptly declined to go to Peking.





		2.	Disarmament.



A.N.	Clear tht. R. have reverted to original posn. – ban atomic &amp; freeze conventl. forces as at 1/1/55.  R. insisting on discussg. their proposals first &amp; alone – not as part of phased plan which we &amp; Fr. proposed.  That wd. ensure tht. effective guarantees were enforced before any step taken.

	Seems therefore there is no basis for an agreemt.

	U.S. regard it as wholly unreal.  We, Fr. &amp; Can. wd. like to continue discns.  Think we shd. hang on as long as poss.



P.M.	Yes : let R. be plainly responsible for any b’down.



A.N.	Record will be publd. when mtg. ends.

	Wd. like to bring out of discns. an outline of a Treaty – more flesh than present skeleton.  Wd. submit this to Cab., before tabling it.



Sw.	Useful fr. Dom. angle.  Communiqué stressed fact tht. disarmament must be comprehensive.





		3.	Israel.



P.M.	Severe fight.  Who was to blame?



R.	Israel.  All casualties on Egyptian soil.



P.M.	Most serious event since Armistice.

	Our line shd. be : refer to U.N. and counsel both sides to be calm.



R.	Egyptians have already taken steps to that end.





		4.	British Prisoners in Korea.



H.M.	Do F.O. regret timing of publn.?



R.	Angered Chou.  But prob. only one more excuse for being awkward.



P.M.	A.E. was keen to publish.  We cdn’t have foreseen co-incidence with his suggn. of mtg. Chou.



H.C.	Imgr’s Bill M.P. is thinkg of moving under 10 min. rule a Bill to amend law of treason – to cover U.N. operations as well as war.  Seeks advice.  Wd. it embarrass us?



Ll.G.	No harm in that.  More awkward ques : P.Q. suggesting Incitement to Disaffn. Act shd. be applied to Acts done outside U.K.  But, even if done, cd. hardly be made retrospective.  There is much feeling in country.  Awkward to have to admit we can do nil.



H.C.	Let him have a run on this Bill.



P.M.	Agree with that.  Ll.G. shd. consider what can be done, w’out altering the law.

							[Exit Kirkp., A.N.





		5.	Floods in Australia.



P.M.	Act quickly.  They sent us £50.000 last year.



R.A.B.	New practice : but now so many precedents it’s awkward not to go on.



Sw.	Much worse than Toronto (£25,000).  But help in kind (drugs etc.,) is specially useful.  And avoids invidious comparisons of sums of money.



P.M.	I had thought of £250,000 – tho’ some may be in kind.



W.	May be awkward for them to spend money.



Sw.	Also – a State Govt.



D.S.	Do it in kind : makes much bigger impn. at the other end.



		R.A.B. and Sw.  to consult &amp; make v. early announcemt.





		6.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	B/E. wish it to be clear to Cab. i) policy shd. work towards redn. of v. high Bank rate  ii) while monetary policy can assist, main battle v. inflation must be waged by Govt. measures.

	Posn. of sterling has bn. strengthened – tho’ no dramatic change.





		7.	Parliament : Redistribution of Seats.		[Enter Att.G.



Ll.G.	Oppn. have suggested talks re amendmt. of law.

	Wd. not be wise to do it now.



J.S.	Favour talks : but not before Election.



Ll.G.	There is still atmosphere of controversy – over seats affected by these changes.



P.M.	Four years before actions comes.  Suitable for next Parlt.





		8.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.



P.M.	Need for F. Affairs debate after A.E.’s return.



Sal.	Debate in H/L. on Defence on 16/3 and 17/3.





		9.	Prince Ernst Augst of Hanover.



Att.G.	Doubt if I can hold this decision if they appeal.



								[Exit Att.G.





		10.	House of Lords Reform : Expenses of Peers.



Sal.	Debate on 9/3.  Have circulated my speech to Cab. Cttee.  They may wish me to refer to Cab. on i) powers ii) expenses.

	Shall circulate these passages next week.

	J. has told me Opposn. (H/C) won’t touch H/L. Reform – or Peers’ expenses either.  Looks therefore that Oppn. wd. oppose any move, twds. expenses ; and in H/C. might attack it violently.

	Afraid this means we cannot act in this Parlt.



							[Enter G.Ll., B.C., H.W.





		11.	Coal Prices.



G.Ll.	Bd. will take responsibility.  Govt. come in only on point of c/living effect.  Date : mid-March.



P.M.	Glad we didn’t do it with R.A.B.’s statement.

	Think we shd. await A.E.’s return.  Wd. this be wise if we wished to have early action.



	O.P.’s note was read.



R.A.B.	Can’t comment w’out notice.  Wd. wish to consider.



P.M.	Prs. O.P. will circulate his views in memo.



R.A.B.	If N.C.B. think these increases necessary, Govt. shd. support them.

	Thght amounts calculated to avoid too large a surplus.  Wd. help to check inflation.  Also, if less imports, b/payments.  Believe this will have to be done.



O.P.	Increased prices to industry shd. be limited to what is necessary on commercial grounds.

	Diff. to justify all the items increased cost quoted in E.A. memo.



G.Ll.	Known tht. Ty. have favoured increased coal prices.  But my figures have not bn. fudged to fit that.  I have m’tained tht. increase shd. not be larger than what is commercially sound.  But it shd. cover all of that – incldg. extra cost of imported coal.

	Extra £17 M. on safety measures.  Big p’mme for non-inflamm. conveyor belts.  Will cost £3 M. this year.  In ’56 cost of new Safety in Mines Bill comes into a/c.  Can’t cost it exactly : but will be large.  Cap. exp’re. is getting under way : £70 M. more                      [Exit B.H.

	borrowing.  Annual total cost : £6 M.  Big p’mme of R &amp; D.  Staff College for management.

	Earlier estimates of increased costs have proved sound.  There wd. be surplus of £8 M. in ’55 : but only £1½M. in ’56 – deficit accumulated wd. then be still £10 M.



Sal.	Does “luxury coal” include smokeless fuels.  Are they to go up?

	Wd. affect our “smoke” campaign.



G.Ll.	Yes.



H.C.	Exemptn. of lower grades doesn’t evade increase in c/living.



H.W.	Agree – only the direct immediate effect.



W.	Effect on exports via increased industrial costs.



P.T.	If it made more coal available for sale abroad, it wd. help exports.



W.	What about competitive prices of manufd. exports?



P.T.	Wd. not help.  But, even so, I favour increases.  With £62 M. of increased costs, there must be some increase in price.



H.A.	Shd. we go on importg. at higher price than we export?



D.E.	Must do more to check inflation.  B/E. have said so.  Would not this support it?



R.A.B.	Yes : tho’ it has not bn. put formally to B/E.



H.M.	Agree – must check inflation.  But coal is no longer an industry – it’s a cross we have to bear.  Object of N.C.B. is to sell less coal – because men won’t dig more.  No commercial realities about this.  Ques is : how can we most cheaply get out of problem.  Unless we do this soon, we can’t get the relief on house coals.  But first we shd. scrutinise the figures.  Unless natd. indies. show a deficit, you can’t hold wages.



B.C.	Wd. add another £5 M. to deficit of B.T.C. – stultifying our recent announced estimates.



G.Ll.	Scarcity of face-workers, plus weak managemt., is source of trouble.  But if NCB get tough, there is a strike : &amp; we have to import more.  If NCB go strongly for increased prodn., they increase their weakness.  Hence better to reduce demand.



J.S.	Consultn. with consumers – e.g. steel industry.



H.M.	i) Some increase is inevitable.  Better do it quickly.  

	Decide wtr to cover £62 M. or less.



P.M.	Decision at Cab. on Mon : 5.30 h/c E.P.C. meanwhile.
