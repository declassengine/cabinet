C.17(55)							23rd February, 1955



		1.	Economic Situation.		[Enter G.Ll., R., Att.G., H.W.



R.A.B.	After ’51 we reversed trend &amp; m’tained good posn. – with aid of terms of trade.

	Terms have turned v. us.  Increasing competn. from G. &amp; Japan.

	Situation now calls for urgent action – this week or next.

	Suggest Bank rate be raised to-morrow &amp; at same time take other action to relieve pressure on internal demand.

	Discussed with E.P.C.  Propose that these be i) stiff increase in Bank rate  ii) resumptn. of control over h.p. terms, &amp; its extension to articles not previously covered – incldg. furniture.  O-in.C. to-morrow.  iii) coal prices : increases (adjusted to exclude much domestic coal) designed to reduce other consumer exp’re. by £60-70 M.  Wd. be mentioned in general terms in my statement to-morrow.  iv) operations in transferable sterling resultg. in commodity dealings which deprive us of dollars.  £ is now 70% convertible because of commodity markets.  Transferable rate must not be left below official rate.  Proposed therefore tht. Exchange Equ. Account be authorised to operate in this market.  This is a step on road to convertibility insofar as it brings the 2 rates more closely together.

	i) to iii) wd. be announced to-morrow.  iv) wd. be a private authy.  These measures shd. reverse trend &amp; eventually restore b/p.



P.M.	Rapid change in situation.  But threat foreseen in recent speeches by R.A.B.  

	What shd. we do and when?

	Continuing uncertainty or apparent lack of firmness by Govt. wd. make things worse – by encouraging wrong sort of speculation.

	Increases in coal prices is unpleasant.



P.T.	Hire-purchase.  Support R.A.B.  Small in effect, but controversial.  We shall need to revive D.R. power recently relinquished with self-praise.  This was originally introduced in ’47 because of b/p crisis.  	We shd. have to require 15% deposit &amp; 2 year period to pay.  Wd. cover furniture for 1st. time.  Will be said effect will be marginal.  Covers only £440 M. out of £11.000 M. of consumer expenditure.  But answer to this is : whole of this problem is marginal.  

	But support it &amp; also doing it soon.



K.	We cut down D.R.55, &amp; told our supporters this wd. make it more diff. for Socialist Govt. to restore full powers.  We shall now be leading the way.

	In debate Ede said we were gambling on fair economic weather &amp; mentioned in terms the terms of trade.

	These consns. do not, however, outweigh R.A.B.’s advice.



R.A.B.	Shd. we say tht. we intend as soon as poss. to present legn. giving permanent powers to control h.p.



D.E.	As they have in U.S.  And h.p. has now assumed U.S. propns.



W.	Support plan for permanent powers.



Sw.	Agree.  Under modern condns. it is a necessary complement to Bank rate.  



Att.G. 	will be v. diff. to enforce H.P. Order.



	Coal Prices.



H.W.	This addn. will in long run be inflationary.  It will increase costs of rlways &amp; steel.  Will therefore strengthen demand for wage increases, when it has worked thro’ the economy.



A.L.B.	It is assumed tht. people will buy less?



G.Ll.	Will help to enforce economy in all consumption, incldg. industrial and thus reduce imports.



H.C.	Won’t help our export industries to face increasg. competn.



A.L.B.	Will add £5 M. to railway costs.



O.P.	How will it help b/p?



G.Ll.	Shd. have to do it soon, on N.C.B. costs.



H.M.	NCB won’t get surplus? – effect on miners’ wages.



G.Ll.	Will still have accumulated deficit, tho’ current surplus.



H.M.	Dangerous to increase prices while wage negotn. is procdg.?



G.Ll.	N.C.B. are not apprehensive on that score.



H.C.	Can you show plainly that this is connected with the other?



P.T.	It is central to problem.  Coal exports are dropping &amp; imports are rising because of domestic demand for coal.  There is extravagant use of coal in U.K.



R.A.B.	There is known waste.  £14 M. on b/p. because of imports.

	Reasons  i)   meet increased cost of coal imports

		   ii)     ..    dropping volume of coal exports.

		  iii) make N.C.B. accounts balance.



H.M.	Only sound if it doesn’t enhance internal inflation.



Sw.	And if it leads to economy in industrial use of coal.



RAB.	Increased prices of coal, gas &amp; electricity wd. also reduce other consumer expenditure.



Sw.	Proposal assumes tht. all re-act alike.  Rentier may cut other exp’re.  But wage earner presses for increased wages.



P.T.	But shd. be asked to do it soon on N.C.B. costs grounds.



H.M.     x/	Better to do it after a wage increase.  Relate it to that.



R.A.B.	Our waste of coal, &amp; import of it, is an aspect of confidence in sterling.  Because of lower internal price.



O.P.	Large increase in price last year didn’t produce economy in use.



P.T.	Easier to relate coal to b/p. than to relate h.p. to b/p.



D.S.	Wd. it be accompanied by planned redn. in coal imports?



R.A.B.	In summer.



G.Ll.	Figures wdn’t support x/.  Due to import costs.  We lose £2 on every imported ton.  And gain £1 on each exported ton. (?)



H.W.	Support x/.  Earlier action mght alter course of negotns.



W.	You cd. argue this deficit position as reason for refusing higher claim for wages.



G.Ll.	Don’t believe this wd. cause further wage increase.



H.C.	New N.C.B. apptd. last Mon.  Shd. they start with this.?



G.Ll.	Arguable that this wd. be good first gesture by new Board.



R.A.B.   y|	Wd. like to have at least a sentence tht. coal (imports/exports) has bn.

    | 	gt. strain on our b/p. and posn. is being considered.



G.Ll.	Wd. prefer to do it now on b/p. grounds.



R.A.B.	Proceed as at y/. after discussion with G.Ll., and submit draft to Cab. to-morrow.



G.Ll.	Earlier introdn. of increases made it poss. for N.C.B. to agree to lower prices for lower grades of house coal.



H.A.	Effect on older trawlers.  Will mean increased price of fish &amp; increase in trawler subsidy.



O.P.	Can’t accept view tht. increased coal prices is good method of checking inflation.



H.M.	Shall we ever recover our coal export markets?  If we shan’t, there is no point in exporting while importing.



G.Ll.	Believe there is much in that view.
