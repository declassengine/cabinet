C.M.6(55)							26th  April, 1955



		1.	Election : Press Articles.	[Enter B-H., 3 Serv. Ministers



P.M.	Rule v. journalism may be relaxed during Election campaign.  Central Office will co-ordinate.  Payment shd. not be accepted.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Motion is likely to take form of regretting tht. no enquiry has bn. appointed.  (Nat. Service Debate).



	Business for next week.



P.M.	N.S. Debate : Shinwell &amp; Robens will spk. for Opposn.



H.M.	Case to be developed by Oppn. is the use these men cd. be in industry.



P.M.	If I reply, I must handle it mainly on f. policy lines.  This is not a moment at wh. we cd. make a change.



S.Ll.	No case for enquiry – it’s matter for Govt. decision.



H.M.	Need for N.S. is changing – peace-time purpose in cold war vice reserve armies for hot war.

	Use of men in Services – has no connn. with period : needs continuing attentn. not ad hoc enquiry.



A.H.	Man-power economy on Suez &amp; Trieste is being taken up in creation of strategic reserve in U.K.



	Post-Election Session.				[Exit Serv. Ministers.



P.M.	Think there shd. be good content in Q. Speech.  Cd. Session run right on?  Need therefore to get ahead with prepns.  Want to carry impetus fwd.



H.C.	I advise longer Session.  True people will be tired after Election.  But we shd. need spill-over.  That being so, better to run right on.  Pol. advantage of showing some big projects in [first] Queen’s Speech.  E.g. Clean Air Bill ; Copyright Bill : Gowers Rpts.

	If we agree to long Session in principle, work shd. go fwd. at once in prepn. for it.  Aim at introducing before July Clean Air Bill and one of Gowers Bills (prs. Agriculture).  Our main Scottish measure shd. be included in Queen’s Speech.

								[Exit B.H.







		3.	Formosa.



H.M.	Tel. from Dulles – asking us to ascertain wtr Chou is sincere, before 9.30 a.m. today!



P.M.	Wd. like to say in reply to P.Q.’s Thurs. tht. we are pursuing possibilities arising fr. Chou’s statement.

	M’while, cd. tell Nehru we have allowed D. to say we are enquiring &amp; we will continue to keep him in touch.  H. to consult H.M. on this.





		4.	Four-Power Talks.



H.M.	Propose to table plan at mtg. of officials startg. 27/4.  Read out formula.

	Clears up any possibility of disagreemt. betwn. A.E. &amp; W.S.C.



P.M.	V. ingenious formula.  If all problems solved at lower level, there wd. never be need for mtg at top level.

							[Enter G.Ll., B-C., Att.G.





		5.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	No room for conciliation.  B.T.C. ready, if men don’t strike, to discuss differentials – tho’ little prospect of satisfying them.

	T.U.C. are much concerned, &amp; are in touch with Unions to-day.

	Can’t forecast what will happen : N.U.R. may not hold all their men in.

	Must await further visit by T.U.C. to-day. Then I may have to make statement e.g. in H/C. Wed.  Also Govt shd. make [public] further appeal to ASLEF : e.g. shd. P.M. send for them.



Ll.G.	Emergencies Cttee. suggest Prodn. on Mon., and Rgs. be made at once.

	Regional Cttees. alerted.  Immedte. need will be troops to drive G.P.O. lorries : leave wd. have to be stopped this Friday.  Publicity wd. be needed for this – but also B.T.C. wd. announce Friday tht. livestock wd. not be accepted.



P.M.	Resume this part of discn. Wed. – with P.M.G. in attendance.



K.	Para 2 of memo.  If T.U.C. suggested further thght be given to differential &amp; promised to persuade N.U.R. to agree, shd. we encourage B.T.C. to follow it up?  Shd. we then have enquiry into differential, provided ASLEF w’draw strike notice.



W.M.	B.T.C. wd. be ready to discuss that.  But NUR wdn’t agree : that is diffy.  I agree, however, tht. this is only hope – discns. betwn parties or even enquiry on this point alone.



P.M.	Greater differentials w’in existg money or net addn. to labour cost?

B.C.	Must be latter – otherwise some wages wd. have to be reduced.



W.M.	But cd. look to future : viz., on structure – to be taken into a/c. on next award.

	It wd. be discn. on principles w’out commitment.



R.A.B.	Our policy shd. be to push T.U.C. into the lead on this.

								[Exit G.Ll., B.C.

[Enter I.McL.

		6.	Ministry of Agriculture : Functions.		



H.A.	Resp. for food hygiene &amp; cleanliness was to be transferred to M/H.  Wasn’t done on earlier transfer because not worked out in detail.

	Order doesn’t need aff. resoln.  Cd. be made &amp; laid on 6/5.  Wd. like to complete process in this Parlt.

	Decn. in principle has bn. announced.  Opposn. don’t object to this transfer, but wd. have liked more.  They can pray v. it, after transfer, in new Parlt.  But they cd. complain of losing chance to pray before transfer takes effect.



I.McL.	We cd. do without it, if politically preferable.



H.C.	Privy Council is now fixed for 4.30 p.m. &amp; Parlt. rises at 11 a.m.



W.	Feeling is strong in H/L.



		Agreed : P’pone.





		7.	Common Land.



H.A.	As in memo.



D.E.	Strong feelings may be aroused.



Att.G.	Can’t we defer until after Election.



P.M.	T. of ref. cd. be much shorter.



K.	Support this project – but not now.



P.M.	Consider referring to it in Q. Speech.



J.S.	R. Commn. wd. high-light it too much.



P.M.	Consider t. of r., membership and status.

	Reserve decn. wtr it shd. be in Q. Speech.

 

C.M.7(55)							27th April, 1955



		1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.[Enter A.H., G.Ll., C.H., B.C.



W.M.	ASLEF officers are seeking a way out.  Trying to get agreemt. to a request by T.U.C. &amp;ASLEF to M/L. to convene mtg. with B.T.C. – not on money or differentials but on procedure.  At best they will suspend, not w’draw, strike motions.  But likely to accept award m’while.

	If this proposal comes to me to-day, I will arrange for mtg. at M/L. – tho’ I shall not participate.



A.E.	Favour this, but formula is pretty tight.  Minister cdn’t refuse to provide facilities for mtg.



B.C.	B.T.C. wd. have to insist on i) indefinite suspension of notice ii) acceptance of award iii) readiness to discuss any outstanding ques.



RAB	No indicn. of weakness involved.



	Draft of statement to be made in H/C. by M/L. approved, subject to amendments.



Ll.G.	Service leave.  To be stopped Friday if G.P.O. lorries are to be driven on Monday.



P.M.	What delay wd. be involved if you waited?



PMG.	Don’t want a back-log at outset.  Wd. upset emergency arrangemts.  No Service vehicle will go to a rlway station.



B.C.	That meets B.T.C. anxieties.



A.H.	Only 500 men.  Mght not become generally known.



W.M.	Ready to accept that risk – very small.



		Agreed :  accept risk : H.O. to have statement in readiness

			   for issue if need be – P.M. to see draft.



						[Exit A.H., Ch H., B.C., G.Ll.

		2.	Cotton.



R.A.B.	a)  Clear that quota is only answer to pol. needs of Lancs., and prs. its economic needs.  R.M. thinks U.S. wd. resent quota v. Comm. less than general quota, wh. wd. lose us our bicycles.  Satisfied, however, tht. it wd. have to cover all Colonies incldg. H. Kong.  Believe we shall have to come to it w’in 6 months.  Accept, however, fact tht. this general issue shd. not be raised just before Election.

	b)  How much will Indian concession help?  Suppose it means 15 m. square yds. (increase of 12 m.) – it wd. give us a worth-while case.  Wd. impress Opposn., who don’t really favour quota.  

	c)  Purchase tax.  	i) Lancs. will be content with nothing less than complete w’drawal.  Street has now said so.  Means £42 M.

				ii) Wd. do as much harm as good to make minor concession now.  Ready to defend that now &amp; in Lancs.

				iii) Possibility is 100% removal of p.t. from cotton.  Cdn’t do it for wool because made up by numerous small people.  Yorks. have now protested v. what we have done already.

	Price redns. wd. be small : adminve. diffies. wd. be great, for tax wd. have to be collected fr. retailers not manufrs.  Changes wd. have to be made in adminn. after election.

	We shd. be brkg. into p.t. en principe.  It now yields £300 M.  Can’t risk its collapse.  Ratio of 25% - 25% for cloth &amp; made-up is as far as we dare go.  Process order wd. be resented by trade.

	Diff. to make concession with dignity &amp; honesty.

				iv)  Considered raising D. level.  But it leaves higher quality goods unhelped.

				v)  Redn. of p.t. on clothes.  But concession not needed.



W.	My informn. is tht. if we don’t give some satisfn. we shall prob. lose 7 Lancs seats, which we now hold.



H.	Need for v. careful prepn. before we encroach on Comm. free entry. cf. recent Canadian refusal to limit our textile imports in interest of their home trade.



Ll.G.	Support this reluctance to accept quota as perfect remedy.



D.E.	Wd. also lose us Liberal votes in Lancs.  Wage earners in Lancs. are less worried about this then mill-owners.



P.T.	All this means tht. only extra concession we can make is on p.t. 

Admit Ty. diffies.  100% redn. on cloth wd. give our candidates all they want because that is what Lancs. has asked for, right or wrong.  Does distort tax : wd. encourage people to buy cloth &amp;have it made up : but that is against trend of mass habit.



O.P.	Can’t clap on quota.  Diff. to make concession on p.t. w’out appearance of weakness.  After Election, surely p.t. will have to go, on cotton textiles.  Cd. not candidates in Lancs. pledge themselves as individuals to work for abolition?



P.M.	We (C.R.O.) try to get Indian decision by 2/5 for announcement 5/5

	We reserve decn. to make further concession on p.t. until we know wtr Indian concession is enough.  If it isn’t we have a reason (other than Opposn. pressure) for doing more on p.tax.



	3.	Austria.



H.M.	i)  Neutrality.  Accept it militarily but not otherwise.  	     Agreed.

	ii) Guarantee.  Must see how this works out.  Four-Power : or right to intervene : or oblign. to intervene : or what?



P.M.	R. usually mean it operates if all Four Powers agree to operate it. i.e. jointly but not severally.  We needn’t go beyond that if Austria is content with it.



H.M.	Will report back on this.  U.S. won’t be able to go too far.
