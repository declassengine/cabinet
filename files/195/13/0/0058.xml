		1.	Colonial Immigrants.				[Enter R., B-H.



P.M.	P.Q. today by Osborne M.P.

	Read draft answer.  A.L.B. will talk with Manley : but immigrn. into U.K. is a matter for H.M. Govt. in U.K.



Sal.	Will that imply we aren’t going to act.



P.M.	Don’t want to imply we are.



Sal.	Add : “at the present time”.



D.S.	No objn. to being pressed to do more.



		Approved – as amended.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Speakers for Thursday.  Agreed : W.M. and H.A.W.



RAB.	P.Q. askg. if 2nd. Fin. Bill will be introduced.  Shall say : not disposed to favour it.  Tho’ it will mean a heavier Finance Bill next year.

	Can’t, I think, do a technical Inland Rev. Bill w’out opening general financial discn.





		3.	Crown Lands.



P.M.	Do Cab. approve form of new organisation.



RAB.	Eventually, we shall have to decide Ministerial responsibility.



Sal.	What sort of man will Chairman be?  



P.M. 	Independent.



H.A.	This is good scheme.  Earlier form laid too much on permanent head.

	Doubtful wtr permanent head shd. be deputy chairman.  Cd. be Dir. Genl.



		Agreed :	Approve form of organisation.

				Publish report.





		4.	Aden.					[Enter G.W., C.A.S.



P.M.       x|	Organisation of our Forces in Aden will come up for considn. on Thursday.  No armoured cars available.  May have bn. cause of disaster.  Air cover not enough.



A.L.B.	Journey was about 20 miles – especially dangerous.  The tribe is only about 400 strong.



C.A.S.	Ground is v. favourable to ambush.



P.M.	Will M/D. m’while discuss x/ with C.A.S.

							[Exit G.W., C.A.S.

		5.	Industrial Disputes : Ocean Liners.



W.M.	P.Q. by Logan M.P. about call-up of young men.

	Our action is normal – on notific0. by Pool tht. they are no longer seamen.



B.C.	Notificn. is by a Bd. which is joint employers/workers.



W.M.	If they return to sea before call-up is effective, deferment wd. be enjoyed again.



R.A.B.	Have seamen a right to strike?



W.M.	They may not have it.



R.A.B.	Is there any diffce. betwn. official or non-offil. strikes. 



Att.G.	No.  Ques wd. be wtr or not they have signed articles.  But has so far “notified” only men who have broken articles.  A man who declines to sign articles wd. not be “notified” at least for some days (more than 14).



W.M.	Bd. can justify notificn. on grds. of breach of articles.

	Wd. like Att.G. to consider, before Thurs., in what circs. a merchant seaman has a right to strike.	Agreed.



			M/T. will provide full note on facts to Att.G.



		Dock Strike.  Mtg of Ldn. Stevedores last night decided to advise a 

W.M.		return to work.  If this appd. today, it will help.  Disputes Cttee. of 

T.U.C. will be mtg. on Friday.

									[Exit B.C.

[Enter A.N.







		6.	Austrian Treaty.					



A.N.	H.M. wants to proceed with ratificn. – tho’ Treaty laid for only 9 of 21 days.  Oppn. consulted &amp; have no objn.

	But enabling Bill is needed so tht. O-in-C. may bring our law into line with obligns. we have assumed in Treaty.  Precedent : Italian Treaty.  Needed for protn. of B. subjects who can’t rely only on Austrian waiver of claims in Treaty.

	Despite need for this enabling Bill, we cd. go ahead &amp; ratify.



Att.G.	11.3.1953 by Swinton in H/Lds. : stated constitutional posn.  But no legal diffy. in going on.



S.Ll.	Enabling Bill wd. have to apply retrospectively to date of ratification.



A.N.	If we wait for Bill, and O-in-C., we shd. be last to ratify.



	Agreed :  Put enabling Bill thro’ quickly &amp; ratify as soon as 

    passed.

C.H.	Ld. Macdonald is coming to see me to ask Parties to review decision.  I will see him to-morrow.  P’pone my directions until afterwds.

N.B.	Longer we wait, more it will cost.

	Problem as in memo.

	Much inconvenience to Ministers concerned.  Admy. House is best temporary home for P.M. 

	Timing : twds. end 1956 because Admy. war damage will have bn. prepd. by then.  Seek decn. in principle as a basis for planning.
