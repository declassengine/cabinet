C.88(54)							16th December, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B-H., S.Ll.



H.C.	Business for next week.





		2.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.		[Enter B.C.,  G.Ll.



Sw.	Last para. of B.R.’s statement.  Does reference to “stat. duties” imply tht. they cdn’t increase deficit w’out legn.?



W.M.	Not so intended.  Plural “duties” widens it.



H.B.	This is the best wording which can be devised, from Ty. angle.  Improvement on yesterday’s.



W.M.	In last para. H.M. suggests omission of [  ].  I agree tht. this wd. be improvemt.

	Timing &amp; presentation.  We advise a single document.  Because it is only in B.R.’s last sentence tht. any hope is held out.



P.T.	Public will read this solely as reference to increasing deficit.  “any problems arising in connn. with mtg. the increased costs involved.”



B.C.	Ty. prefer the existing draft.



W.M.	Timing.  Don’t want issue Sat., – for  fear of mtgs. on Sunday.  I wd. delay it, to arrive on Mon. morning.				Agreed.

	Handling with Press.



P.T.	Last line on p. l. is “greatly” too much – on scheme we haven’t seen.



A.L.B.	There are the other 2 factors.



K.	Don’t tone this down.  We must appear to have some ideas &amp; hopes on this.



W.M.	Press. 	i)   Criticism will be : no answer to ques. on assurance.  Say, in guidance, B.T.C. haven’t asked us for help.  Wd. be premature to intervene.

		ii)  If they dislike award given at arbitn., their agreemts. don’t require them to accept it.

		iii) B.T.C. say “with all speed”.  M/L. can get tribunal to sit equally quickly.

		iv) Nothing offered or refused.  No ques arises of [others] help.

Support for this line can be expected from engineering employers and Rt. wing of T.U.’s.

	But quite likely N.U.R. will reject this &amp; issue strike notices.  Then we must consider again what we mght have to do.



B.C.	Agree that this is the right line, despite the risk.



W.M.	When shd. Press publish it?



B.C.	N.U.R. must receive it first.



		Agreed : Deliver letter Monday p.m.  Publish in Press Tuesday.

			   P.R.O.’s to consider wtr publn. before Tues. can be 		   prevented.



							[Exit G.Ll., B.H.

		3.	B.E.A. Renfrew Maintenance Base.



B.C.	Decision needed urgently.

	Move will take 3 months &amp; must be done in winter, when they are less busy.



P.M.	What about strategic dispersal?  Isn’t that worth £160,000 p.a.  We are spending much more on it in other ways.



B.C.	If done on defence grounds, Govt. shd. meet the cost.



P.T.	I can’t start compensating people I compel to move on D/I. grounds.



P.M.	Don’t compensate : increase the deficit.



H.B.	BEA are in deficit now.  They are being pressed to reduce it.  If we now force them to this uneconomic course, we shall find that more diff.

	Repercussions on dev. areas policy.  Private industry wd. expect treatment not less favourable than that accorded to a natd. service.



W.	Contrary commercial argument.  Shd. B.E.A. not carry this as a war risk insurance.

A.L.B.	Renfrew is a target area, just as Ldn is.



D.E.	Fatal to efficiency for Govt. to discourage B.E.A. fr. making this economy.  Other aircraft work will go to Renfrew.



S.Ll.	Canadair contract.  Can we see wtr this will be signed, if premises available.



W.M.	That wd. influence me : I fear trouble then, addl. to R. Royce redundancy.



H.B.	Believe contract will go thro’ at once if known tht. premises will be available.



S.Ll.	Airwork have another job (Sabres) on which they wd. need 100 men.



A.L.B.	Find out definitely wtr Airwork can do this, if they get premises.



D.S.	We can’t tell natd. industry to run inefficiently.

	We have done quite a lot to develop aircraft industry in Scotland.



Sw.	There is nothing in the strategic argument.



K.	Thought pol. posn. cd. be held if alternative work is provided.  Surely we shd. hold B.E.A. there until Airwork is ready to go in.



P.T.	Can do business if we have authy. to say you can have premises if you get contract.



K.	But avoid a vacuum.
