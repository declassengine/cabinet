C.18(55)							24th February, 1955



		1.	Economic Situation.		[Enter R., G.Ll., H.W., B.H.



R.A.B.	Agreed with G.Ll. a brief reference to coal situation, for inclusion in my announcement.

	Bank rate. – by 1% to 4½%.  General support for this decision, as firm action in advance of publn. of February figures for reserves.

	Hire Purchase.  O-in-C. made this morning.  Order will be made under it before lunch.  15% deposit and, mostly, 2 year repayment.  Permanent powers – shd. I foreshadow these in original statement or in reply to supplementary?



H.C.	Better say it – because our policy is not to rely on emergency powers.



	Agreed :  say it is Govt’s intention, as soon as opportunity offers, to seek permanent powers for this purpose.



G.Ll.	Coal Prices.  Brief reference to coal in statement.  N.C.B. to announce this evening tht. they are putting price increases to consumer councils but, in deference to Govt’s views, it will avoid increase in prices of 75% of house coals.  N.C.B. advise tht. this will not be embarrassing to them in wage negotiations.

	Wd. submit to P.M. draft of N.C.B.’s announcement.



Sw.	So early an announcemt. by NCB wd. link it too closely with b/p.



P.M.	What advantage is there in mentioning this in announcemt.?  So vague a reference won’t help to end uncertainty.



H.M.	Prices will have to be raised because of deficit.  Ques now is how to present it and when?  Surely better to leave it to N.C.B. in a day or two to announce it – basing it on all relevant considerations.  Relate it to their general position.



P.M.	Also this draft takes too much responsibility on Govt.  “We asked ….”



O.P.	Mistake to link new burden of £50 M. a yr. on Br. industry with b/p.  Leave it to N.C.B. in normal course.



H.W.	Sooner not take any more Govt. responsibility than we need for what will in the end increased c/living.



P.T.	Must act before long – i) does affect b/p.  ii) delay will mean tht. larger price increases are inevitable.



R.A.B.	Ready to omit it from my statement – so long as G.Ll. is supported in early action on coal prices.



G.Ll.	Wd. wish N.C.B.’s statement to issue to-day or to-morrow.



P.M.	Not so soon.  Nor so vague.



Sal.	If so soon, better on one day.  But prefer coal statement to be left until later.



H.M.	Price must rise.  Don’t mind when.  But present as related to N.C.B.’s position generally, not b/p.



P.T.	Announce, thro’ N.C.B. next week.



		Agreed :	no reference to coal in R.A.B.’s announcement.

				Resume discn. on coal next week.



								[Exit G.Ll.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Defence debate 1/3 and 2/3 on Govt. motion.

	Public Works Loans Bill was to have bn. taken on 28/2.  Wd. R.A.B. prefer, in view of Item 1, that it be deferred?



R.A.B.	Wd. provoke discn. on Bank rate, local loans, housing subsidies etc.,



H.C.	Ty. wanted it by a specified date.  



R.A.B. 	Not essential.



R.A.B.	If they ask for debate on to-day’s statement, combine it with this Bill and take it together.  If they don’t, p’pone Bill for a week.



D.E.	Get it over on 28/2 before month’s b/p. figures come out on 2/3.  Announce Bill on 28/2, and get it over.  They are bound to ask for debate.



							[Enter Solr. Genl.





		3.	Valuation for Rating.



D.S.	If nothing done, new lists will be publd. in Oct.  Legn. will have result tht. new lists aren’t publd. until Apl.

	Delay by Order i) wd. be regarded as pretty low tactics.  ii) open to other practical objns.  We cd. do it later, if Bill miscarried.

	Don’t therefore take this alternative now.

	Bill will make necessary admin’ve. changes, quite apart from pol. advantages of deferring publn. of lists.



P.M.	General feeling in Cab. seems to be in favour of legn.  I am not.



R.A.B.	Spoke to A.E.  He favoured legn. as proposed.



		Approved.





		4.	Parliament.  Expenses of Peers.



P.M.	I am saying to-day – no legn. on Junior Ministers this session.



Sal.	Not a good day to decide my problem.

	I had suggd. £3 a day for attendance &amp; assumed it wd. be exempt from tax.  Now told that subsistce. allce. at work is taxable.  If, however, made for expenses not attendance Revenue wd. not bring it to tax.  Not ideal : for it requires Peer to justify all items of expense : cdn’t claim £3 unless he had spent it.  But it may be best we can get.

x|	May I mention this, as possibility, to some Peers (incldg. Jowett) &amp;

  |	 ascertain their re-action.  Needn’t say Cab. have considered it.

	Debate on 9/3.  Shan’t now (because of them!) be able to announce anything then.



R.A.B.	Wd. apply to Ministers who are Peers (?)



		Approval for x/. in confidence : with no indication, yet, of date 	of introduction.



B.H.	Awkward, if this is done this Session, to p’pone actions re junior Ministers.





		5.	Title of M’Agriculture.



H.A.	Must have all three names.



P.M.	Then put Agric. first and Food last.





		6.	Colonial Office Building.



A.L.B.	May 2 Dpts. consider plan for Richmond Terrace bldg.

	Report back to Cabinet.



P.T.	May Att.G., &amp; L.P.S. be added &amp; report also on Gt. Parlt. Square.
