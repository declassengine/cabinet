		1.	Formosa.



A.E.	Discussed with C.P.M.’s what next stage shd. be.  Generally agreed it wd. be unwise to go on with Oracle.  We haven’t yet tabled resolution.  Tho’ danger tht. U.S. may want us to do so.  Have instructed Dixon to say tht. discn. of resoln. wd. now exacerbate feeling &amp; wd. do no good as it wd. obviously be vetoed.  Propose therefore to wait until Monday &amp; hope tempers will cook.

			Cabinet – took note of position.





		2.	Pakistan.



P.M.	M. Ali has made his statement re republic.  I expd. my regret, as did P.M.’s of A. &amp; N.Z.  But mtg. agreed P. shd. remain w’in Commonwealth.

	In view of danger of leakage, decided to announce at once.  

Holland’s interesting suggn. tht. Govr. Genl shd. be elected.



Sal.	Deplore use of term “independence” vice “self-government”.  Implies getting away from our inter-dependence.

	Have bn. most anxious not to disturb our relations with Libya, which are satisfactory.

	U.S. take same view as we do.





	5.	Thermo-nuclear Weapons.



P.M.	We have told Comm. P.M.’s – warning them that it is specially secret until disclosed to Parlt.

	I am convinced tht. it wd. be better to announce it in Wh. Paper.  Isolated announcemt. might lead to awkward scene in Parlt.
