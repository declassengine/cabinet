  <content>C.25(55)							16th March, 1955

		1.	Four Power Meeting.				[Enter R., B.H.

P.M.	Read reply to our telegram.  W’ton 568.
	Looks as tho’ U.S. don’t contemplate any early mtg. with R.


		2.	Parliament.

H.C.	Business for next week.
	Budget : April 19.	} to be announced in Statement on Business
	Apl. 7-19. Easter Recess.	}


		3.	Colonial Immigrants.

Ll.G.	Resoln. on Colonial Immigrn. at Central Council mtg. to-morrow. 
	Our Bill is nearly ready for Cabinet.  What do we say to-morrow?

P.M.	That Govt. have it under constant &amp; urgent considn.   Diffies. are evident, but clear tht. grave problems will be raised here if influx continues.

A.L.B.	Lloyd is on his way back fr. W.Indies.  Possible they may impose some control.  Avoid premature announcemt. of our plans – because of that &amp; also because mght invite forestalling.  Tory Party is divided on this.  Comm. Assocn. are recommendg. amelioration of condns. in Colonies as right remedy.  We shd. preserve freedom of manoeuvre.

R.A.B.	Junior Minister shd. go &amp; make temporising statement.

W.	Better to have no statement on behalf of Govt.  See how discn. goes and let Junior Minister speak only if necessary.  Let both sides be stated.

P.M.	Leave it to W.  Better not have any other Minister spkg. on this.


		4.	Newsprint.

P.M.	Said tht. new arrangemt. favours D. Mirror as against Tory newspp.

P.T.	Last autumn offered 50.000 t. more and another 50,000 t. if they made scheme obviating Govt. control.  They have done so, but not all newspp. have accepted it.  They now ask for enough to give them one more ½ page.  Prefer to p’pone that until they take over control scheme.  D.Express are campaigning v. scheme.
	Can’t have a fight with Press on this now.  Have asked Supply Co. to see me, to report progress.  At a dinner Thurs. I will commend it. If I can draw promise of scheme, I wd. then offer them the ½ page: tho’ newspp. organn. doubt if I should.

R.A.B.	Press have had 50.000 t. more &amp; promised another 50,000 on condns.  All they do is to start unnecessary sheets e.g. Junior Mirror.
	Suggest we threaten to w’draw our offer if they don’t play the game.
	W’in limits of my concession, you can negotiate.

P.T.	Bishop favours linking extra ½ page with acceptce.  of voluntary scheme.  Suggest I have authy. to give it when it won’t prejudice    ..             .. 

			Approved.
							[Exit B.H.  Enter I. McL.

		5.	Local Government Reform.

D.S.	Immedte. ques : what shd. I say when Bills come forward.
	L.A. assocn.  have shown unexpected readiness to agree.
	Propose I make statement as in draft – revised to meet comments of L.G. Cttee.

H.C.	Unfortunate tht. it was re-opened after earlier decision to let it rest until after Election.

D.S.	Para. 1 of memo sets out earlier decn. : I have done nothg. inconsistent with that.

R.A.B.	M/Housg. has bn. surprisingly successful.  But is a hornets’ nest. e.g. demotion of small boros., diffies. about l.e.a.’s.  Reference to L.G. finance will invite ques about re-rating.  We can’t say much on the genl. issue in Election.  Less said better, now : but take credit for extent of agreemt. secured.

H.M.	Why not omit §9?  

D.S.  	Ty. wanted it.  We shall be asked.  Better to have considered statement.

R.A.B.	Bury first sentence of 9 in another para. &amp; add merely that it’s under considn.  No reference to me.  Agreed.

H.C.	Circulate as written Answer.    Agreed.	[Exit I.McL.
							[Enter A.N., N.B.


		6.	United Nations : Assembly, 1956.

R.A.B.	Limiting factor is hotels.  Even tho’ we turned out 25% of tourists we cdn’t get them in.
	S. Bank : if anything, shd. have Nat. Theatre.  If this is erected, shall we ever get it down.

A.N.	U.N. convenience wd. be best met by mtg. outside N.York.

Sal.	Drop this idea.  Wildly expensive – &amp; inconvenient.  Advantages wd. not be commensurate.

	Better to make a start on a permanent Confn. bldg &amp; don’t ask U.N. to come here until we have it.  Then we can give them a good show.

D.E.	Support that view.  Cd. be made to pay, taking one conference year with another.

		Agreed :	i)  No tempy. bldgs. for U.N. in ’56.
				ii) M/W. to submit proposals for permanent
confce. bldg : and announce that so as to show
we are interested in havg. internatl. mtgs. in Ldn.

Sal.	What of hotels?

P.T.	We need more.  But private enterprise finds they don’t pay.


	7.	Comet Aircraft.			[Exit N.B., A.N.
							[Enter de L., S.Ll., B.C., H.W.

R.A.B.	Shd. we move at once to Mark III?
	Will emerge at same time as new Boing – &amp; may beat it.
	Means abandoning Mark II.
	Leaves 19 of these.  About 13 cd. be used by T’port Command.  A few may be used by Farnboro’ &amp; one or two bought by aircraft operators for training purposes.  I wd. take responsibility on Votes.  But are Govt. justified in using them?  I think so, in view of strengthening.
	Shd. recover our outlay in sales of Comet III, wh. will then come in 18 months or 2 yrs. earlier.

de L.	We shd. have to carry passengers, as well as freight, in them.

H.M.	We must make it clear they will not be used at all unless Air Certificate is given for re-inforced type.  Object of decision is to move more quickly to Mark III.

de L.	I favour this.

R.A.B.	If Air Cert. is not granted, I shall have to find other means of giving financial help to de Havilland.

						[Exit S.Ll., de L.
							[Enter G.Ll.


8.	B.T.C. Charges.				

		a) Freights Scheme.

B.C.	This seeks maximum, not fixed, charges.  Will arouse comment.
	But I propose to let this go fwd. w’out comment.

A.L.B.	Parlt. raised no objn. to principle of maximum charges.

			C.(55) 66 : approved.

	b) Short-term proposals.

B.C.	B.T.C. seek interim increases in fares and freights to reduce deficit.
	Only on freights (£17.7 M) does M/T. share responsibility.  I can reject or seek Tribunal’s advice.  On other proposals, my only way of stopping them is by formal direction.
	On increased costs, incldg. wages, B.T.C. face v. large deficit wh. ought to be tackled.  P. Opinion, wh. supported wages settlement, recognised tht. increased charges wd. follow.  B.T.C. are making economies (£15 M) pari passu.  Some such increases are inevitable unless Govt. are ready to subsidise.

R.A.B.	These figures [can’t be challenged] – are odd, on m’tenance.  Looks as tho’ it’s rigged.  But no alternative.

B.C.	Apart fr. m’tenance figure now on actual cost, as foreshadowed in 1953 report) deficit is quite large enough to warrant these increases.
	New fares wd. come in at end/April, or early May.
	Announcement about end/March.  That cd,. be p’poned.

Sw.	Why not defer passenger fare increase until advice is available on freights, so that all can be introduced simultaneously.

H.M.	Don’t decide this to-day – in absence of A.E.

G.Ll.	As we didn’t raise coal prices when R.A.B. made his statement, I am trying to play it long – trying for end/May.

		Agreed :  resume discussion next week.

								[Exit H.W.

		9.	United States Aid for Pakistan.

P.T.	Tenders from Lancs. – may get 2 or 3m. dollars’ worth of orders.
	But 50% U.S. ships is a condn. : if we reject it, we can’t get contract.  Then we shall sell no textiles to P’tan this year.  50% wd. in any event come in U.S. ships.

R.A.B.	Must support P.T.  Essential to get this contract.  Don’t see why this comes to Cab.

Sw.	Business will go to Holland if we reject.

A.L.B.	We shall have conceded principle &amp; breached solidarity of opposn. of maritime countries to 50% condn.  V. strong objn. in shipping circles.
	Wd. U.S. Govt. insist on it?

P.T.	Have verified fr. W’ton tht. no chance of getting contract w’out this condition.

B.C.	Even Manchr. Guardian opposes this.

		R.A.B. to discuss with P.T. and B.C. &amp; repve. of C.R.O. 
at 6 p.m.
