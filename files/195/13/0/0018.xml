C.4(55)								13th January, 1955



								[Enter A.H., Att.G.

		Kenya.



A.L.B.	Tels. 35 and 41. tabled – giving texts of statements to be made by Govr.



A.E.	Satisfied with 35.  Fear 41 may startle people in this country.  Better to reverse order of 41.



A.L.B.		Accept that.  							Agreed.



P.M.	Wd. it not be enough to suspend procdgs etc., v. loyalists until we see wtr general surrender takes place &amp; a new situation results.



A.L.B.		Can’t let it appear tht. fate of loyalists depend on success of surrender 		appeal.

	Ministers now support proposals of Govr. &amp; Att.G.  Erskine also agrees.



A.H.		With reluctance.



L.P.	It wd. be v. strong measure to stop, for pol. reasons, procdgs which have already bn. begun.



K.		Continuing the 9 cases already started needn’t spoil general effect.

Anyhow decision, or action, to stop them wd. rest with Att.G. in

Kenya.



Att.G.		Some emergency regn. will be needed for this.
