C.C. 5(53)							27th January, 1953



		1.	Germany.			[Enter de L., Heath., J.P.L.T.



A.E.		Some informn. obtd.  – doubtful if enough for prosecn.

	Tel.62 (F.O.) re firm of English solrs. askg. grounds of arrest, liberty to interview.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Bentley decision – no reprieve – is not discussible in H/C.  Spkr. is alive to this.

	Not too many statements after Ques.  H.M.  Mistaken practice.

	Business for next week.  Rot. Housing and C.E.C. on Consol. Fund Bill.  Thereafter Transport Bill – Cttee.



Sw.	Simon’s Bill.  Sal. has seen indep. Peers, and later persuaded S. not to press for Divn. on 2nd Rdg. but wd. adjourn the debate.





		3.	Beaverbrook Press.



A.E.	Read draft answer to P.Q.  Approved.





		4.	Egypt : Supply of Jet Fighters.



A.E.	P’mme of delivery sanctioned by Cab in (?) Nov.

	Pilots here from Egypt to take delivery of first 4.

	P.M. wants delay.  We can produce technical hitch wh. will cause one weeks’ delay.



de L.	May not look v. convincing.



A.E.	Many P.Q.’s for answer tomorrow.  I can’t hedge on those.  Must say we are going to supply.  May be asked if any have gone : or, if I admit they haven’t, improves case for adjournment.



Ch/Al.	Neguib’s behaviour has worsened since Nov.  Delay might sober him.



A.E.	I must take a line in H/C. tomorrow.  Don’t want to make a rapid change of policy, on eve of talks re Sudan.  Can say no more will be sent for the moment.



		General view : Hedge in H/C. Wed. &amp; see how talks go.

	*	Techn. hitch shd. be arranged &amp; notified before H/C. discn. on 	Wed.

							[Exit de L.

 

	5.	Coronation : Naval Review.



J.T.	There won’t be room for all H/C. – only about 60 couples for both Houses outside Ministers etc.,   1.200 “foreigners”.



H.C.	You must provide more for Parlt.



J.T.	Another ship – at cost of £14/15.000.  To accommodate 250.

		R.A.B. to consider with Admy..  60 is too little.



							[Exit J.T.

		6.	Sunday Observance Bill.



M.F.	I am against an enquiry.  Play for a direct negative vote.



J.S.	Opposed to enquiry.  On a report, Govt. would be involved in legislation.



Heath.	Minority only favour enquiry.  Good chance of getting negative vote.



A.E.	Deprecate enquiry w’out positively turning it down – in debate Friday.



M.F.	May Under Secretary take debate  -  Agreed.



								[Exit Heath.

		7.	Transatlantic Telephone Cable.		[Enter P.M.G.



P.M.G.		Radio service unreliable – 80% only because of atmospherics &amp; no 	privacy.  Will be saturated by 1960.  U.S. are keen, and if we don’t go 	in with them they will go ahead with a route wh. will lose us traffic.



		Cost £10 m. (50/50 shares, unless Canada participates).  Over 20 years 		total cost mght total £25 m. : income during that period might be £40m 		assumg. continuance of present rate of traffic.  U.S. are more 			optimistic.

	Anyhow, cost will be at least covered.

	Initial dollar advantage.  Our co. will prob. get contract for cable, or most of it; and majority of laying.

	We wd. adopt U.S. system fr. U.K. to N’foundland and Br. fr. N. to M’land.

	Will cost a little more &amp; involve some loss of efficiency : but U.S. scheme is more fully tested.  Adoptn. of ours wd. involve delay.



	Want to insist tht. 2nd cable shd. come to U.K.  Believe U.S. wd. agree.

	If Cab. approve this, we shall approach Canada.  Welcome it if she comes in (on Empire grounds) but don’t press her (we shd. lose some dollars).



R.A.B.	Go ahead as proposed.

	Wdn’t want Canada in.

	*Hope G.P.O. can include it w’in their investmt. p’mme.



P.M.G.	Will discuss * with Ty.



Sw.	R.A.B. wdn’t press Can. out if she wanted to come in?  



R.A.B. 	No : but don’t encourage them.



								[Exit P.M.G.

		8.	East/West Trade.



R.A.B.	Fin. controls won’t work – failure wd. have bad effect on sterling.

	Wd. prefer to discuss with B/T. wthr. physical controls can be applied.

	Dutch are the problem.



O.L.	Tran shipmt. control wd. put me in gt. diffies. in H. Kong &amp; Singapore.

	I must have good advance warning.



Ch.	Cd. get Dutch in if we promised fin. control : we cd. then allow them to be ineffective.



R.A.B.	Other reasons too – bad for confidence if we appear now to extend the control.



O.L.	Physical transhipmt. control is cumbersome because of mixed cargoes.



L.	I agree.



P.T.	Support R.A.B. on fin. controls.  Cdn’t make it water tight enough to get Dutch agreemt.  Ready to look at physical, tho’ wd. involve legn.



A.S.	We are seekg. return to priv. trading in metals etc.  This wd. be delayed by controls.  I wd. prefer physical to financial control, even tho’ legn. needed.

	Support R.A.B.



A.E.	I had hoped for both.



P.T.	Dutch only ask us to impose transaction control : wdn’t insist on its applying to Colonies.



		Agreed :	Ty. &amp; B/T. to consider further the possibility 			of transaction control.

				Recognise tht. legn. wd. be controversial.



Ch.	Can’t U.S. bring pressure on Dutch?  It’s action by Dutch that is wanted &amp; they are makg. it condn. tht. we impose control.



							[Exit A.S.

								[Enter A.H. &amp; C.I.G.S.

		9.	Egypt : Rodeo.



AL.	Short of troops for Rodeo because Brigade w’drawn and Battn. gone to Kenya.

	Need to bring them up to strength they had.

	Now at 96 hrs’ notice.  Takes 48 hrs. to fly a battn. fr. U.K.  That battn. shd. therefore be at 48 hrs’ notice here.  Can’t be done w’out being known.



A.E.	Will suggest sitn. is deteriorating.



J.S.	Can be said to be due to Kenya.



A.L.	Wd. it be bad thing qua negotns. with Neguib?



A.E.	Was thinking of alarm in U.K.



C.I.G.S.	We cd. do with 96 hrs. – for they are wanted only in support.



A.H.	96 hrs. wd. only mean suspending overseas leave.



		Agreed :	do this, with no advance statement.  If asked, say 			we keep 1 battn. alerted in case of emergency 			overseas.  * P.M. to be informed on return. *



A.E.	M’while, risk of trouble in Iraq has receded.



							[Exit A.H. &amp; C.I.G.S.



		10.	Central African Federation.



Sw.	Preface will be signed.  This follows precedent.

	First public announcement of determination to proceed.



O.L.	There will be P.Q.’s and a row.  We shd. face it now.



A.E.	Reference is “full membership of Comm” – first mention?

	What of other Doms’ views?



O.L.	Ambiguous on that point.



Sw.	Must point the goal.



A.E.	Shd. other Doms. be told in advance?



Sw.	Ambiguity of words lets us out on that.



A.E.	Para 2.  “No one of these Territories ….” wd. be preferable because of Europe.



             x/	Sw.	Will try to get that changed.

		Subject to x/ text approved.



R.A.B.	Are we to finance Nyasaland in interim?  What will that cost?



O.L.	No grant.  Finance prs. but not aid.





		12.	Brazil : Exports.



R.A.B.	E.P.C. – degree of agreemt. on proposal for U.K./U.S. agreement &amp; action by Bank and Fund.  Brazil owes £50 m. to U.K.  Suggd. tht. drawing on Fund for that might upset Doms.  But it is not really a sterling advance by U.K. – and we may get dollar advantage.  If presented thus, it shdn’t be embarrassing to Austr.  Money will be drawn from Fund and Brazil will become liable to Fund.

	Involvement of Fund will be best means of exercising control over Brazil.



O.L.	How much involved is drawings?  Only £12 m. out of £50 m.  What of remainder?

	If they let us down, we mght do better to take some imports fr. Brazil.



Ch.	Eg. 5/6 wks’ supply of cotton at U.S. prices.



O.L.	Plan still leaves £38 m. outstanding.  Shd. we not reduce that by a purchase – even if goods we don’t much want.



R.A.B.	1935 settlement funded part of debt. We may have to fund part of £38 m.

	Cotton : gives physical result : but Brazilian law governing sales.

	Cotton Bd. won’t buy it.  Think we shd. at least wait to see wthr. their price falls.



Ch.	Don’t suggest buying above U.S. price.



R.A.B.	Suggns. tht. Brazil realise they must be more realistic re price of cotton.



P.T.	If we buy cotton we don’t need, pressure to buy fr. Pakistan &amp; Sudan will be v. gt.



R.A.B.	Believe my plan is only safe course pro. tem.



P.T.	We were under a v. gt. pressure to extend credit to Brazil – tho’ it now appears we went on too long.
