C.C. 2 (54)					12th January, 1954



			                                   [Enter Watk. D.E., D.S., G.Ll., B-C.

155.	    Four-Power Meeting.



A.E.	R. have become much stiffer re arrangemts.  Originally proposed Sov. Emb. on security grounds.  Western Powers offered 3 mtgs in W. Berlin and one in Embassy.  They reject &amp; offer parity 2 : 2.



P.M.	That is realistic – there are 2 sides, tho’ 3 Powers are on one side.



A.E.	We have made concessions all along the line on place &amp; procedure.

Ours was a fair compromise suggn. – indeed, our original suggn. of C. Commn. Bldg. was reasonable itself.



Sal.	The more you concede to R., the more they want.

	Wd. leave it to A.E.’s judgmt.



L.P.S.	On 2 : 2, they will demand Chairmanship of all mtgs in their Embassy.



Sw.	R. are being unreasonable : but this is not an issue to break on.



H.M.	Support A.E. :  cd. say it showed we weren’t ganging up into a single side.



A.E.	Read draft telegram :  don’t accept R. view :  refer it to Moscow :  and suggest either 3 : 1 on Berlin location or go even now to neutral place as we originally suggested.



P.M.	Try again for Allied Commn. bldg. &amp; offer to fly 4 flags over it during mtgs.



A.E.    *	Try that first :  then 3 : 1 :  then refer back.  No message to Mol. m’while.



			Agreed as at *





1.	    Industrial Disputes.

157)	

Watk.	El. Union has started guerrilla strike.  Rebuff y’day :  not as many came out as expected :  they have had to raise strike pay by 1/3rd.

Next Mon. due to call out all.  That will be test of their authy.

	M’while we shall take no action.  Union wd. not attend a tribunal or heed its award.

	If there’s a one day strike on Monday, employers will lock-out for a day on Tuesday.

	Must therefore review situation on Wed.



					[Exit Watk.





1.	    Atomic Energy.

158)	

Sw.	Support qua Australia.



D.E.	Cd. we get concessions to prospect outside their area?



Sal.	They are in no mood to give us that now.  They fear there will be less than they may need.  S. Afr. may be largest producer after all.  Best thing to do with A. is to create good atmosph. for later discns.



D.S.	Wd. have bn. better if we had bn. tough at start.  Shan’t do any good by bargaining now.  Generous treatment is more likely to evoke co-opn.



			Memo. approved.





1.	Persia.				        [Exit D.E., D.S., Simonds.

			                                                  [Exit Maudling

A.E.	Seen Fraser.

	Have secured a basis for starting negotns.  Agreed with A.I.O.C.

	Doesn’t mention share for A.I.O.C. in consortium.  Co. accept 50% - am putting that to U.S. Govt. &amp; seekg. their agreemt.  The U.S. oil cos. will accept it :  but U.S. Govt. may not.  Want this cleared with U.S. before we go to Persians.

	“Avoid need for arbitn.”  This because we shd. get paid in oil by the other cos.  Int. Bank not mentioned – prefer to try to get away w’out them.

Wait &amp; see if P. insist.

	Co. must be regd. as a Br. Company – qua prestige.



H.M.	But won’t want that qua taxation.

	If it is to be regd. Br. Co. we must avoid paying Persians in any share of ultimate profit – e.g. in oil sales or something which comes out before tax is levied.



G.Ll.	Must be sterling oil.



A.E.	This is diff. issue – ahead.



P.M.	Note it for special examn. by R.A.B.

Dipl. immunity for cos. with internatl. business.



			                                   [Exit G.Ll. &amp; Maudling











			                    [Enter J.T., Ward, Solr Genl., 3. C.O.S., A.L.B.



1.	    Egypt :  Defence Negotiations.

160)	

P.M.	Fear tht., if E. accept our last-word terms, we are committed.



A.E.	Yes:  but we won’t make any modificn. of our Oct. terms.

	Shall I send these now to Dulles?



P.M.	Yes.



				Agreed.



P.M.	But still a chance tht. E. will reject.  If they do, shall we give them a time-limit?  F.O. &amp; C.O.S. both say satisf. settlement wd. help us with other Arab States.  Wish I cd. believe this.

Agreemt. wh. C.O.S. describe as serious mil. disadvantage is hardly likely to enhance our prestige in other Arab countries.  But we have all gradually bn. drawn into acceptg. Oct. terms.  Can’t avoid standing on that offer.  But, surely, when we have informed U.S. we shd. give E. a time-limit to accept or reject.

This agreemt. wd. replace ’36 Treaty?



A.E.	Yes.



P.M.	Had hoped it wd. only modify it.  Can we salve what isn’t changed?



A.E.	Will consider that.



A.E.	Believe agreemt. wd do no more good in M/E. than alternative (c).

M/E countries are not solidly with E. now.  Jordan is dissatisf. with Arab League &amp; has said wd. like Br. troops in J.  Iraq is thinkg. more in terms of R. danger.  If we stay in E., they will think we are still there &amp; can return.  Better therefore than (c) unless we cd. combine it with troops in Jordan.  Also Mardin.  Anything which shows we are still there in M/E.  Don’t think Israel wd. allow troops in peace – only base.  Prs. we cd. do somethg. else for I., to balance troops in J.



P.M.	If we get agreemt. what happens after 1961?



A.E.	How much is Base worth?  If you need it, agreemt. is only way of getting it. (c), tho’ politically attractive, wdn’t give us Base.



P.M.	W’house &amp; Co. wd. say do (c), but keep 10,000 troops in E., as allowed by Treaty.  Wd. they be a bait?

	Don’t value Base :  only troops in sitn.

	Endorse C.O.S. point re double approach to Canal Zone.

	Must be ready to say what will happen after 1961?  Cd. you keep Treaty alive for that?

Sal.	I liked (c).  But C.O.S. memo has shaken me.  They say Base is essential &amp; no other site in M/E wd. do.



P.M.	What wd. they do after 1961?



C.I.G.S.	In 7 interv. yrs. wd. hope to convince E. of need for self-defence.

Get them to continue Base.  Also more mil. cohesion among Arab countries as a whole.  That, with Br. stiffening, is our best hope for future.  Admit it is only a hope.  Try also to get Pak. to accept R. flank responsibility :  encourage Turkey to build up L. flank.



P.M.	E. may turn next to Sudan.  Relns. with E. are unlikely to improve – unless we abandon Sudanese.  That row is bound to last 3 yrs.



A.E.	If Turkey &amp; Iraq get together &amp; we forge outer ring, E. will be less important apart fr. Base.

	Go on with Mardin.



CIGS.	Coupled wth pre-stocking in Jordan.

	Mardin wd. be v. forward base :  only part of answer.

	Go on with discussions with Turks.  There are diffies., but not insuperable.



C.A.S.	Mardin etc., wd. only be attractive if Iraq remained friendly.  If  Breach with E. made [mght make] Iraq less friendly, Mardin etc., wd. be no substitute.



P.M.	Let us see what happens when D. has our terms. 

		U.S. may then press E. hard to accept.



A.E.	M’while, may we pursue Mardin with Turks?

Wd. do no harm if E. learned of that.



S.W.	Quite good qua Doms.  A., N.Z. &amp; S.A. plans are all based on assumptn. of Base.  They wd. like agreemt therefore with E.  But, if it fails, good to show them there is some alternative.



P.M.	Have this studied (by U.K.) and specific proposals submitted.  Staff study.  Def. Cttee. can discuss.



H.C.	Are you content tht. proposals shd. go to U.S. before anything said to Govt. supporters in H/C.?



A.E.	Not much worried on that.  We are negotiating :  can’t be expected to tell H/C. while negotns. are procdg.



P.M	Tell Dulles.  But prepare statement for Govt. supporters if needed.



A.E.	Cdn’t state it all before negotns. break down.

			Agreed :  no need to be apprehensive on that point.



			Agreed :  F.O. to prepare drafts of messages to Jordan &amp;  Israel   re posting of Br. troops in Jordan.





	Sterling Balances.



P.T.	£6-7M. advantage to exports if E. made import relaxations.



B.C.	RAB. favoured release before Xmas.  He wd. certainly favour it now.



P.M.	They wdn’t have offered it at all if we hadn’t w’held the £10M.



P.T.	Don’t press it if it’s thght there are other advantages in delay.



P.M.	Why trust them?



A.E.	Shall we do a deal –



P.M.	RAB wd. be affronted by strings on a banker’s oblign.

	Keep them waiting.

					[Exit C.O.S.



1.	    Comet Aircraft.

161)	

A.L.B.	WD. have grounded them myself if they hadn’t volunteered it themselves.



P.M.	3 out of 12 have crashed.



A.L.B.	Testing tail unit to destruction.

	Some hope also of evidence from remains in Medn.

	Will set back hopes of U.S. cert. of air-worthiness.



			                                                          [Exit 2 Serv. Ministers.





1.	    Privileges for International Organisations.

162)	

A.E.	As in memo.



P.M.	Do we get reciprocity? 



A.E.	Yes.



A.E.	Includes good organns. like N.A.T.O.







1.	    Indian Commissioner in E. Africa.

163)	

Sw.	Nehru has agreed to recall Pant. – before end/Jan.  For consultn.  Not certain wtr he will get another post.
