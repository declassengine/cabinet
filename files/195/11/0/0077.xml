C.C. 72 (53)				                                                         26th November, 1953



						[Enter B-H.

141.	    Parliament.



R.A.B.	If we can’t get Judges Bill before Xmas, it can be made retrospective to 1st. Jan.



H.C.	Shall have to p’pone 2nd. Rdg. until after Xmas.





1.	    Egypt.



P.M.	Waterhouse came to see me.  Not concerned about Base, but about protn. of Canal.  If we can’t stay on one side, want to stay on the other.  1936 Treaty contemplated other arrangmts. for that.



A.E.	It didn’t.



P.M.	Let us try at B’muda to get U.S. support.  Not on basis of mil. force in area, but tht. U.S shd. make econ. aid condl. on their (E) accepting minimum U.K. condns.

	We shall have serious trouble with Tories if there is an agreement.



A.E.	Other Tories understand position much better than Waterhouse.



P.M.	Suppose these negotns. brk. down, cd. we get U.S. to support a new plan – NATO air base, even with E. commander:  to safeguard Canal  3-4.000 B. troops.  And elsewhere in M/E 1 armoured divn. (20,000 maximum).



A.E.	E. wdn’t enter N.A.T.O.  Nor wd. E. allow 3-4,000 troops.

	Prs. Fayid cd. be developed into Anglo-U.S. Base.



Al.	Don’t protect Canal now-a-days by sitting on it.  Need fighter orgn. in advance of it.





143.	    Parliament (resumed).



H.C.	Business for next week.

	F. Affairs debate.  May I say it will be held immediately after return fr. B’muda.



P.M.	Return 10th.



A.E.	N.A.T.O. 14th. – 16th.



H.C.	May be pressed to hold it on 10th. : Ministers returning 9th.

	Either 10th. or 17th.

P.M.	Don’t commit us to a date now

	

	Housing :  Marples to open :  2nd. day Eccles and Macmillan.





144.	    Bermuda :  Policy in Far East.

					[Exit B-H.

	Note taken.



H.C.	Don’t draw too much attn. to 5 Power Agency – it is doing good by stealth.





1.	    European Defence Community.



A.E.	Proposed exchange of lrs. wd. involve another Annual Review in E.D.C. &amp; Commitmt. to stay in Europe.



Al.	Avoid that.



A.E.     	   |  If we reject this, I shd. tell Massigli before he goes to Paris – 

	x |  adding tht. they can raise it at B’muda if they like.

	

H.M.	Must recognise growing weakness of France.  Due to their own intellectual arrogance – &amp; pressure for federalist structure. Now they’ve got it, they are terrified of it.  It’s the federal organn. that frightens them now, rather than strictly mil. elements.  We can’t now buttress this plan any further.  Better it shd. collapse – &amp; start all over again.



P.M.	What if F. say at B’muda they can’t carry E.D.C.?



A.E.	U.S. will demand entry of G. into N.A.T.O. – wh. wd. mean a G. national Army.  



P.M.	I wd. favour that.  G. will now look west. If they do, aggression v. France will be ruled out.



H.M.	Fr. started fed. idea at time when G. weak &amp; they thght they wd. dominate it.  We told them it wasn’t wise.  Now G. is stronger and they see the danger.  If they had bn. content with a looser assocn., we cd. have bn. in it.



Sal.	Wd. prefer G. in E.D.C. than in N.A.T.O.  Therefore don’t hurry N.A.T.O. idea.  Try to force E.D.C. by saying our guarantees may have to be w’drawn if they don’t pass it.



Al.	G. will have 12 Divns. in 2 yrs. fr .word “go”.  All plans are laid.

They wdn’t have full equipmt. : but trained men wd. be available.



H.M.	P’pone all the federal structure &amp; go on with the Eur. Army side of it.



A.E.	Can urge this on them at B’muda.



			Will consider wtr. I do x/ before or at B’muda.





1.	    U.S. Loan Agreement.



R.A.B.	If we can’t get revision of agreemt. we shall never get waiver.

	Tell them we think facts justify us in claiming waiver &amp; that we shall claim it unless they advise us they wd. reject our claim.



P.M.     	x|  How can we talk on “independence” while we claim waiver.



RAB.	Tactical move only – to get revision.

	Must shock them into paying some attentn. to our affairs.



P.M.	Have paid interest for 2 yrs. – increasing our credit thereby.

You now suggest turning twds repudiation.  Will that improve our credit.



O.L.	Not repudn. to invoke clause in agreemt.



A.E.	V. diff. decision.  Shock tactics:  to induce U.S. to discuss revision.

Fear they won’t talk about that &amp; leave us to invoke waiver.

That wd. be serious for us politically.



RAB.	Art 6 has effect tht. you can only claim waiver in a good year [following a bad.]



A.E.	We wd. get $100m:  but we are getting $200m in aid.

	Suppose we drop idea of waiver this year &amp; press, with greater righteous indignn., for revision.  Strong posn. for us.  And wd. avoid risk of getting waiver this year – wh. wd. damage our credit.



R.A.B.	$100m wdn’t satisfy me if we lost face thereby.



P.M.	Repeated x/.  Critics here wd. say we have chucked it.



R.A.B.	Inanition in U.S. Ty.   May continue unless we blow them out of it.



P.M.	Leave it to Gaitskill to “repudiate” this.



H.C.	Same condns. apply to Canadian loan.  No ques of revision.

Awkward to claim Can. waiver for no reason.



O.L.	Tactics.  Don’t think this wd make them talk revision.  Agree with A.E.



W.	R. Burgess, good friend of ours, won’t respond to these tactics.



A.E.	Threat to claim waiver won’t be kept secret.  Will rouse Press ballyhoo in W’ton.  



O.L. 	y| Will start up anti-Bri. lobbies in U.S.



P.M.	We might have claimed it 2 yrs. ago : hard to do so now, w’out damaging our credit in U.K.



O.L.	And U.S. Govt. won’t talk revision after y|.



P.T.	We tried last year paying &amp; askg. for revision talks.            } That’s all

	This year we try claiming waiver   ..     ..    ..    ..                  }  it is.



A.E.	{Let Ty. give us, for B’muda, pp. on Export/Import Bank

	{&amp; other U.S. misbehaviours wh. prevent us from earning

	{our living.



[Pp. for    ]

[Bermuda]	R.A.B. {Menzies’ initiative.  I will suggest what mght be said to 

		    {Eisenhower at B’muda, to please M. w’out doing what he

		    {wants.



R.A.B.?	Insist on revision.  Say, pending that, we reserve our position on claiming waiver.



P.M.	We must pay if we can.  Shall not claim waiver.



			Agreed : Press for revision.

			               No threat of invoking waiver.

			               Indeed, say we are going to pay this year.

		Tho’ we surrender no rights to waiver.

			               Keep Canada informed.

					[Exit Simonds.



1.	    Overseas Information Services.



P.M.	Cab. Cttee. of Ministers not dplly. concerned shd. examine these pp. and submit their recommns. to Cabinet.



		Appointed – Home Secy (Chairman)

		                     L.P.S.

		                     M/Labour
