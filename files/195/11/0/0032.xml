C.C. 24(53).				1st April, 1953.



	1.	Parliament:  Pay of Members.	[Enter  B.H.



P.M.	H.M. has asked leave to bring deputn. on salaries of Members –

		to-day at 4.30.  R.A.B. &amp; H.C. will accompany me.  I shall

		say – interestg. ques., shd. be debated in H/C., why not use

		a Supply Day?  I can’t help it if some of our people support it.

		It puts on Opposn. the responsibility of raising it, w’out

		committing us.



O.L.	WD commit Govt. if H/C. carried motion in favour of it – with 

		support of a few Tories.



R.A.B.	Thinking of enquiry – to cover also pay of Ministers, esp. Junior

		Ministers.  Tempted by idea of adding Judges too.



P.M.	Spoils the case for saying tht. Judges are unique.



R.A.B.	Anyway, Judges wd. be easier if enquiry into other came first.



Sal.	What about expenses for Peers.  Is that to be included in enquiry?



P.M.	What of workers’ pay : enquiry wd. whet appetites.



W.	V. poor effect on p. opinion.



H.C.	Enough to-day to listen to deputn?



P.M.	If you have to have enquiry, don’t drag Ministers in.  For Junior

		Ministers we cd. get larger expenses.



R.A.B.	Prefer to-day to do no more than listen.



P.M.	They won’t rush into debate – will play for Govt. to take initiative.



B.H.	Consult Party before suggestg. Debate : for there cd. be a vote even on

		adjournment debate.



O.L.	Listen to-day : play the other card later.		[Exit  Sal.





	2.	Coal Mining Industry : Enquiry.



L.	Mtg. with Fuel Cttee of H/C. last evening.  Persuaded them not to 

		press for enquiry.



P.M.	My informn. is tht. they were dissatisfied.



B-H.	And mine.

P.M.	At least it puts us on side of miners.



L.	Not opposed to enquiry – but not just yet.





	3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business after Recess.  Budget.  To be compiled on followg. Monday.

		Transport Bill on Tues. 21/4 – p’poned from y’day.



			                                          [Enter  A.H., J.T., Solr.G., Birch.

	4.	Amnesty for Deserters.



M.F.	As in memo.  Para. 5.  Prosecutg. authies. will follow same course for

		mistaken claims as for others.  Others, not covered by this 

		statement, will continue liable to prosecn.



			Memo. approved.

			Statement to be amended as proposed in my brief

			        on paras. 3 and 5.

				[Exit  A.H., Solr.G.

				[Enter  S.Ll., C.N.S.

	5.	Falkland Islands.



O.L.	Only need is for frigate to stay so long as threat of Arg. action.



J.T.	No such threat.



P.M.	Take marines off at once in frigate.  Let John Biscoe rescue

		stranded Chileans.

				[Exit  Birch &amp; C.N.S.

				[Enter  D.S. &amp; A.S.

	6.	Steel Allocation.



Sw.	Shipbldg. plate is scarce, but bulk allocn. doesn’t help over that :

		Ministers will take admin. action to ease that.

	Export.  B/T. will consider separately.



D.S.	Want to be consulted.



D.S.	Industry asked to send more plate to firms in Sunderland who are

		short.



J.T.	Those dismissed from Shortts have bn. absorbed into repairs.



D.S.	Will announce the adminve. action re plate before we announce 

		abandonmt. of genl. allocn. scheme.

				[Enter  J.S.

				[Exit  J.T.



	7.	Timber Damage in Scotland.



J.S.	Movement to mills of timber wh. can’t be sawn locally is causing

		the greatest agitn.  Purchase for s’piling wdn’t help because

		they can’t saw it locally.



P.M.	More use of portable saws – by tractors – shd. make it poss. to saw

		more locally.  It’s v. small timber.



J.S.	We shall do all we can locally.  But there will be a surplus to move.



R.A.B.	Either direct grant (⅔rds. up to 50/= a ton) for transport south : or

		M/Mat. cd. buy.



A.S.	Objns. to second course.  Unsuitable timber at higher price : reverting

		to public trading for a v. small amount. (about 1% of our total

		consumptn).  Nor have we now the staff.



Sw.	Support A.S.  No precedent (first course) because unique disaster.



R.A.B.	V. well : pay the grant.  Let J.S. announce to-day as proposed.



				[Exit D.S. A.S.

				[Enter F.H.

	8.	Adult Education.



F.H.	This is a mess : we aren’t getting dividends for money spent.

		Average : we pay £4 and student 2/=.

	Suggest appointmt. of Cttee to go into finance &amp; adminn. of those

		schemes.  M’while for this year pay 75% of remuneration &amp;

		expenses of teachers on condn. tht. fees are not less than 

		6d p. lecture.  Mght. mean slightly more or less grant : can’t

		yet guarantee it wd. be no smaller.  WD try to exempt the few

		who cdn’t pay even 6d.

	Wd negotiate this plan with responsible bodies.  There will be trouble

		because some people won’t pay even 6d.  Tho’ I wd. say either

		lecturer can’t be good or the pupil can’t be keen.



R.A.B.	Support in principle.  But who not have enquiry, saying aim is that

		students shall pay more.  But m’while let it go as now.



F.H.	 Must I go on ignoring the Regs. re fees.



R.A.B.	You will get unnecessary trouble.



F.H.	My plan is consistent with P.M.’s letter to T.U.C.



			Agreed : as proposed by R.A.B.



F.H.	Then the grant will increase by about £10,000.		[Exit  F.H.

	9.	Coronation : Representation of Irish Republic.



Sw.	As in my note to P.M.



P.M.	What wd. Brookeboro’ say?



M.F.	Unlikely to object, so long as he is asked.



			Agreed : avoiding a row with N.I.





	10.	Korea.



P.M.	Will make a statement to-day on Chou’s latest offer.

	Will afford opportunity to say how right A.E. was in foreseeing all

		this – eg. supportg. Indian resolution etc.,



Sw.	Corr. statement in H/L.



P.M.	Must do nothg. to discourage friendly approaches – tho’ not be

		deceived.

	Tho’ don’t suppose R. will relax hold on satellites – or U.S. their

		hold on atomic weapon.  But even a milder atmosphere for a 

		few years mght. make the difference.





	11.	Iceland Fisheries.



S.Ll.	Trade unwilling to lift ban.  We have told Iceland Govt &amp; await

		reply.  M’while trying to ventilate it in Over-Fishing Commn –

		technically.

	Danes are now going to impose (lesser ) restns.; but will consult us.



J.S.	Awkward to raise this at first mtg. of Commn.



S.Ll.	Trying to get French to raise it.





	12.	Austin Motor Works Strike.



W.M.	Time now to appoint Ct. of Enquiry to elicit facts.

	Union ask for, with support of T.U.C., w’out seekg. condn. tht. men 

		be taken back.  Have said they will accept Court’s findings.

		Firm wd. prefer not to have it, but will co-operate tho’ they

		can’t be expected to bind themselves to accept findings.

		Redundancy &amp; individual emplt – matters for management.

	Must announce Thurs.  Otherwise Union may spread trouble to other 

		 motor works.
