H.C.	Business for next week.





		2.	Floods .



P.M.	Supplementaries recently.  Never assumed we wd. compensate for loss of profits.



M.F.	Ld. Mayor was concerned about fences &amp; crops in ground : M/Ag. proposes to cover them.

	He was thinkg. of raising figure from £¼ to ½M. to cover some small businesses.

	I have encouraged him in this.  Believe Fund will cover all save large cos. who chose to carry risk vice insuring.  Eve thought £4M. wd. suffice : Fund will be £6 m.  Believe we shall get thro’.

	Propose re-assurg. statemt. on Wed., after high tide on Tues.





		3.	Coal Prices.



G.Ll.	Answer to P.Q. – takes a/c of the Motion now tabled.

	We shd. take firm line against enquiry.  Miners are getting sore – thinking Tory back-benchers re seeking to re-introduce Lancaster plan.  Govt. rejected that 2 wks. after entering office : that created good feeling in mines : must not seem to be indecisive about a Lancaster proposal now.



P.M.	Worried about the £9M. wh. comes to Exchequer out of this.

	P’pone this P.Q. until R.A.B. is back.



G.Ll.	We took a decision on prices.  Don’t want to appear hesitant over this.

	If he w’draws this P.Q., it will be known we asked him to do so.  And appearance of hesitn. will be given.



H.C.	Diff. on Business (time for Motion) if answer isn’t to be given.



G.Ll.	Is there much feeling among back benchers?  



B.H.  	Yes : quite a bit.



J.S.	Party is divided.  



G.Ll. 	Then we shd. give a firm lead.



H.M.	Shd. we be so firm to-day about not having an enquiry.



Sw.	Prefer shorter form of 2nd para. – as in earlier draft.  



P.M. 	So do I.

		Agreed :	P.Q. to be answered as in original draft.

	Motion.



G.Ll.	Ridley Cttee. recommended tht. consumers be free to use what fuel they choose.

	We accepted that.  But Cttee also recommended incentives to use more efficient coal.  We must get Ty. decision on that, w’out delay.



B-C.	Industry hasn’t taken advantage of concessions offered.



								[Exit G.Ll.

		b)  Catering in Stands.  Can’t get tenders unless beer can be sold.



D.E.	Govt. will have to support appln. to Licensing Jj.  



P.M. 	We should.



D.E.	No chance of getting tenders unless I also provide the “services”.  They made a loss in ’37, w’out Catering Wages Act millstone?



P.M.	We shall have to provide the services.



	Expense.    Loss on seats.



P.M.	Receptions.  Only 1.  Agreed.

	Rising Cost.



B.C.	This morning’s decisions have added another £10.000.

	Most serious increase outside M/W. is W.O.  Overtime for civilians at Ordnance Depots and victualling.



Al.	Travel is another main cause of increase.



P.M.	Let M/Def. go into this &amp; see wthr. any economies can be made.





		5.	Korea : Trials of Prisoners of War.		    [Exit D.E., B-C.

							        [Enter J.T., Att.G., S. Lloyd.



S.Ll.	Dulles attaches gt. importance to our agreeing.



J.T.	Serv. Dpts. don’t like moving away fr. Geneva Convention.



P.M.	What will other nations do?

	U.S. keep them in custody : surely we shd. help them if they wish.



Att.G.	Geneva Convn. doesn’t apply to this at all : it isn’t a war.

	Comes into it only as repercussion for future.



Sw.	Canada were reluctant : but think we shd. not be only countries not to comply with U.S. request.



Sim.	This wd. work.



M.F.	We nominated Allied offrs. to our war-crime courts : &amp; no diffy. arose.



H.M.	The risk for the future is not v. gt.  R. won’t bother about Geneva Convention.



P.T.	The real risk is immediate retaliation by Chinese.



Sim.	The objns. are not v. substantial.



		Agreed :	Give a lead to Doms. in favour of going in with 			U.S. on this.



				Tell U.S. thereafter : without touting round all 			Govts.



		6.	Immunities : European Nuclear Organisation.



S.Ll.	Add words “if any” – so as to make it clear tht. we don’t assume that any will be needed.



Ch.	I agree.
