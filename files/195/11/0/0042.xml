C.C. 34 (53)					27th May, 1953



27.	    Korea.



P.M.	Eisenhower &amp; Bedell S. pressed me hard to declare support for latest U.S. offer in armistice talks.  Felt obliged to give them this help.

Cab. will be consulted before we support U.S. re-action to break-down.



		

1.	    E/West Trade.  Br Shipping.



L.	Only risk tht. this allegn. may be true (comm. troops carried in B. ships) is that it is a ship on bare-boat charter for some years.  They are outside our jurisdn.



P.T.	On trade – we are stricter by far than any Europn. country.



P.M.	Heavy imports into China fr. Japan.  And exports fr. China to U.S.

This can come into our reply.



* Draft statement : covering ships &amp; trade.  (L.  to concert?).

Shd. come to Cabinet.





1.	    Sudan.



S.Ll.	Neguib has played into our hands by telling Parties tht. there is no diffce. betwn. Indep. &amp; union with E.



H.M.	Is P.M. satisfied tht. good plans have bn. made to influence elections.



S.Ll.	Intelligence is being restored.

	Trade Commr. Office estabd. as cover for positive action.

	Luce (formerly Govr. Blue Nile Province) is taking a hand.





1.	    Foreign Affairs:  Bermuda Meeting.



P.M.	Must have enough troops for guard/honour and band.

	Half Welch Regt. is going – with goat.

	Can’t move fr. Jamaica until after Coronation.  Must therefore fly.



A.H.	They wd. move by BOAC. in Argonaut &amp; Stratocruiser.  Cdn’t move by sea unless R.N. helped.  Safe in summer conditions.

	Quarantine must be waived for the goat.



P.M.   	I assent to movement by air, in the circs.



P.M.	Date of mtg – still turns on French.

				                [Exit A.H.

1.	    Coronation:  Representn of Malta.



S.W.	P.M./Malta made the carriage a condn. of acceptance.  No more trained horses available.  Decided therefore to suggest Rh. + Ceylon and N.I. with Malta.  Senan. has refused to go with Huggins. because not a full Comm. member.  Sooner go alone in a car.  Suggd. he went with N.I. – refused that also.  Will double up with no one other than Dom P.M.  Have therefore asked Pakistan.  He is considering it.



S.W.	He has now refused.



P.M.	If no, send someone over route in a motor.



		Agreed : P.M. and Sw. to settle – M/D. being co-opted at

			      need.





1.	    Gold Coast &amp; Nigeria.



O.L.	Have made it quite clear tht. ext. affairs, defence &amp; police will be reserved.

Unless they behave, they may lose Canadian capital for Volta Scheme.

Mainly a façade – to give N. an all-black Cabinet.



Sim.	How do you manage defence if they control finance.



O.L.	We provide most.  But we can keep some hold over them.



Al.	We must prevent them fr. controlling African forces.



P.M.	“Crazy to give universal suffrages to these naked savages.”



O.L.	Commd. by previous Govt.  We are playing it as long as possible.



Sal.	Suppose they were denied these 3 subjects &amp; they then demand them – are we clear that we shall refuse?  For otherwise the old Doms. may back out.  Are we clear tht. we shall refuse this when it arises?



O.L.	Yes : para. 10.  Told them these are non-starters.  If they want these, we wash our hands of you.  We must say no – even if it drives them out.



P.M.  	No final conclusion.  M’tain negative attitude.



O.L.	Nigeria.  Collapse of constitution may give us a chance to retard constitutional develpmt.  Divide et impera : the northern peoples are our friends.  But some central direction is necessary to the economic prosperity of the whole.





1.	    Canadian Loan.



R.A.B.	A move to strengthen our capital position.

	Will free our investors &amp; enable us to take a more active part in developmt. of Canada.



W.	V. good bargain.  



P.T.	Indeed.



R.A.B.	Down payment will be delayed acc. to progress of Congress talks on Aid : will take P.M.’s view on timing.



			Approved.





1.	    Unpaid Public Service



W.M.	T.U.C. interests are specialised.  I agree tht. this is right.



J.S.	Will H.O. consult anyone re jurors or go straight to Parlt.



			Draft reply approved.





1.	    The Regency.



Sal.	Cttee. met.  All save J.S. consider Parlt. shd. be invited to pass legn. to give effect to Queen’s wish.  Legn. ad hominem.  Surviving parent may not always be suitable.

	J.S. agrees on guardianship, but prefers Council of Regency.  We see no ground on wh. we cd. oppose Queen’s wishes.  Personality of Regent is much less important than prev. because advice of Ministers.

	In Queen’s incapacity we recommend Prince Chas. shd. become Regent at age 18.



J.S.	Agree tht. D/E. shd. be guardian.

	Regency is another matter.  How will Parlt. &amp; country regard it – esp. if we can’t say Princess M. doesn’t want it.  Both Queen &amp; D/E. may die together &amp; then Pr. M. wd. have to regent.  Safer course wd. be to have a Council.

	Act of 1937 passed after consultn. with C.R.A.  Poss. tht. M.P.’s on all sides may have doubts about D/Ed.



P.M.	Sympathise with that view a little.

M.F.	Precedents (App. I) are all in favour of D/E.

Effect on D/E. – wd. re-act upon Queen’s happiness.



Sim.	1937 pre-occupn. with the automatic was mistaken.



Sw.	Doms. will have to be told.

	Can &amp; S. Africa:  no provision for a Regency.  They wd. have to legislate.

A.	&amp; N.Z.  Sim. advises they are in same posn.

	C. &amp; Pak, are bound by ’37 Act.  Pr. M. wd. become Regent if they didn’t legislate.

	The Doms wd. not legislate in advance of the event.  M. &amp; St. L. agree on that.  C. &amp; Pak. : we must take a chance.  We must ensure tht. they wd. in event accept our choice.

	Wd. propose to hold a mtg. while they are here – Sim. assisting.



Sim.	I cd. discuss the A. &amp; N.Z. posn. with Owen Dixon.



J.S.	Need we (U.K.) act before the event?



Sal.	I originally felt like J.S.  But there is no reason on wh. we cd. oppose the Queen’s wishes.  D/Ed. wd. regard it as an affront, and that wd. be a v. serious matter.



P.M.   	Will tell Queen our provisional view and say tht. we are

		consultg. Dom. P.M.’s.

		Must then consult C.R.A. &amp; Cl. Davies.

Final advice, in light of that, in about 2/3 weeks.
