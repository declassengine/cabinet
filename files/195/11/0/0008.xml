C.C. 108(52)							30th December, 1952



		1.	Kenya.



O.L.	Latest developments.



P.M.	No case of privilege in lt. Pritt wrote to M.P.  The privilege can’t extend to the private side of corrce. with an M.P.



O.L.	Spkr. gave his ruling wrongly.

	Anyhow Pritt communicated with Press also.



M.F.	It is privileged qua libel : by decn. of C.C.A. on a lr to Craven Ellis.



Sim.	But H/C. can’t enforce it’s privilege v. Govt. or a Judge in a self-gov. Colony.



M.F.	O.L. is respons. for justice in a Colony in last resort : it’s not fully self-governing.



Sim.	Appeal to Privy Council is safeguard : not a matter for H/C.



O.L.	I told Kenya Govt. they were clear on basis of what Pritt said in Court or to Press : but shd. take care because of privilege on what he commd. to M.P.’s.



	Agreed:  M.F., Sim &amp; L.P.S. – with L.O.’s – to consider what is posn. of H/C. privilege in this matter.





		2.	Korea.



A.E.	Looks (fr. various indicns. includg. talk betwn. M/State &amp; Dulles) as tho’ new U.S. Govt. will be disposed to get rid of Truman’s statement re neutralising Formosa Strait.  This wd. free them to raid mainland or Comm. held islands fr. Formosa.



	We think this wd. look as tho’ they meant to use Ch. Nat. Forces.

	Wd. be mistaken move.



	Want to urge them to make no such move, at least until we have discussed whole F/E. situation &amp; policy with them.

	Will send P.M. a note for discn. with Ike.



P.M.	Endorsed A.E.’s view.





		3.	Middle East.



A.E.	Value of U.S. investment $726 m. – in M/E.

	If they wd. back us up there, as we do the French, things wd. go better.



P.M.	Egypt : I will put it to Ike tht. we can’t go on for long with 70.000 men there.  Unwise disposn. of available Forces.  With U.S. influence &amp; help, we cd. do with a lot fewer.



A.E.	U.S. may be more ready to think in terms of Air – e.g. agreemt. giving facilities to U.K. &amp; U.S. for air.



Sal.	Diff. for us to offer agreemt. while [Neguib’s Deputy] spks as he does publicly.



A.E.	If N. falls, we shall have a more diff. Govt. to deal with.



P.M.	Do all we can to get U.S. involved.



A.E.	N.’s Deputy is prob. intriguing to unseat N.





		4.	Persian Gulf.



A.E.	Shall say nothg. to U.S. Govt. of our intentions.  Will tell them afterwards.





		5.	Iceland : Fisheries Dispute.



A.E.	Cab. decided to go to Hague Ct. : &amp; to seek raising of ban by our Grimsby men.  This is right.  But no hope of corr. action by Iceland re their restns.  We go to Ct. only on Bay, not on rest.  We can’t therefore offer to Grimsby tht. we will ask Iceland Govt. to lift restrictions m’while.



	We shan’t get I. Govt. to agree : so don’t let us ask them – again.

	They have legislated : they won’t repeal legn. pending decn. of Ct.





		6.	Kashmir.



Sw.	Resoln. in amended form was adopted by Sec. Council.





		7.	Egypt : Release of Sterling Balances.



P.M.	Hoped we cd. keep the £10 m. as a card in our hand while negotns. are continuing.  Don’t admit that they have any right to it.

	If we have to w’draw and move base, I wd. pay for cost of move by cancellg. remaing. balances.



A.E.	Last year we w’held release, exceptionally, because E. was behaving v. ill.

	This year : on 22/10 : we said (in tel. circulated to Cab.) tht. we wd. release the normal sum on normal date in Jan.



R.A.B.	Agreemt. made July ’51.  W’out it E. wd. be able to draw £179M.  With it they can draw only £15M p.a.



P.M.	This shd. have come to Cab. in Oct., before indicn. was given that we wd. pay this year.



R.A.B.	Agreemt is so much in our interest tht. It must not lapse.



P.M.	No : I wouldn’t pay.  



R.A.B	Default wd undermine confidce in sterling.



R.A.B.	Can’t avoid this contractual release of £10M.

	Diff. issue for Cab. is what our attitude shd. be when E. Govt. ask for larger sums to be released.

	Importance of E. cotton to U.K. trade.

	If we trick them over this, they will be up to all sorts of tricks.

	(Agreement is : £5M. on No. 1. A/c if it falls below £45M. (and it has fallen to £6M.) and £10M. on No. 2. A/c.  Total £15M. p.a).

	There isn’t now nearly so strong a case for departg. fr. Agreement.



H.M.	We had a better reason to “default” last year – fighting &amp; rioting in Zone.  There isn’t now nearly so strong a case for departg fr. Agreement



P.M.	We are committed.

	It shd. have been brought up to Cab.





		8.	Life Peers.



Sal.	Simon consulted me : I told him he cdn’t expect any support fr. Govt.

	Now, a further developmt.  Lt. fr. Simon.  He will address a Ques to me askg. wthr. Govt. intend to hold 3 Party Confce. &amp; legislate on its results by midsummer.  If answd. in affirmve.  I wd. not press my Bill beyond 2nd Rdg.



	This doesn’t alter situation.  Can’t be blackmailed on timing re Confce.  I want to get on with that, but not under pressure.

	If we give 2nd Rdg. &amp; Confce. breaks down we shall be commd. to going on with Bill.

	Labour Party, w’out Addison &amp; out of office, won’t try to get agreemt. with us.  We must call the Confce. but it will fail.  We are all pledged to enter into these consultns.



	*  I cd. suggest tht. instead of w’drawing Bill, we shd. defer 2nd Rdg.

	If we don’t start conference this summer, we can’t finish in this Parlt.



A.E.	Don’t like *.  Better to stand on a request for w’drawal.  And if he won’t, try to vote him down.



Sw.	If this Bill gets 2nd Rdg. no chance of getting any other reform of H/L.



P.M.	My view : 2 things shd. be done  i) Peer shd. be enabled to renounce his Peerage &amp; sit in H/C.  ii) Restore “veto” to 2 yrs.

Sal.	Can I say, in reply to Simon’s Ques. tht. we will summon this as soon as we can?



P.M.      x/	We might, in Feb., ask the Leaders if they will join in conference express their views on procedure.



		Agreed at x/.  Sal. to prepare a draft for P.M.’s consideration.



				Avoid 2nd Rdg. of Simon’s Bill.





		9.	Alan Nunn May.



A.E.	Wd. prefer to decline ppt. if he asks for one.



M.F.	Agree – if he asks, F.O. shd. refuse.
