C.C. 9(54).				17th February, 1954.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  S.Ll., B-H.



P.M.	F.A. debate next week – as Berlin Mtg. will end this week.

	Perhaps a W. Paper, as a basis.



B-H.	AE preferred Wed./Thurs.  If so, late in week, we shall be pressed

		for earlier statement or W. Paper.



P.M.	Statement wd. take bloom off A.E.’s speech.  W. Paper wd. be 

		better.



S.Ll.	A.E. dislikes idea of either :  is telegraphing his views.



H.C.	Housing Repairs Bill.  Time for time table for rest of Cttee. Stage

		because of slow tactics of Opposn.  Propose to break this to

		CRA to-day.  2 days for Rpt. &amp; 1 for 3rd. Rdg., after time

		limit for Cttee. ending.  Wd. of course try for vol. agreemt. before

		we impose a time table.  If time-table needed, wd. be debated

		on floor on 22/2.

	F.A. debate will need 2 days :  but one shd. be provided by Opposn.



S.Ll.	AE. won’t be ready before Wed.



J.S.	He cd. escape prelimy. statement if debate were on Tues./Wed.



P.M.	H/C. shd. wait until Wed.



H.C.	They won’t if D. has made a speech earlier.



P.M.	Try for Wed./Thurs. debate on F. Affairs.

		A.E. to decide wtr W. Paper is inevitable.





	2.	Teachers’ Superannuation.



P.M.	Much opposition in Party.



F.H.	Mtg. y’day – 200:  hope that opinion was influenced in favour of Bill.

		Can’t say yet how many were converted – by F.H. and Fin. Secy.



J.S.	Mtg. ended about evenly divided, but balance just in favour of Bill.



B.H.	Whips think opinion much less hostile after mtg.

		May be unpopular but can be put thro’.

	But later Powell &amp; 3 others left lr. threatening to abstain on 2nd. Rdg.



R.A.B.	Clear issue.  Only alternative is to put £2½ M. of taxpayers’ money

		into Fund indefinitely just because teachers &amp; l.a.’s won’t pay

		their share.

	Proper actuarial contn. wd. be 12% viz 6% more than we are asking

		them to pay.



W.	Not a Fund.



F.H.	But a separate a/c.  And it was £167 M. in deficit in 1948 and now 

		is £194 M.  We are takg. over the liability up to ’48 and start

		afresh – not ungenerous.  And increased salaries &amp; pensions

		(April) will impose further strain.



W.	Wd. be less feeling if this cd. be put across to public.



M.F.	Burnham Cttee. knew this was intended when they made their award?



F.H.	Yes :  but can be argued both ways.  Can’t stand on argument tht.

		salaries were raised with this in mind.



R.A.B.	Continue process of education.  I will see any M.P.’s whips are 

		nervous about.



J.S.	P’pone Bill for widows’ pensions?



F.H.	Bill makes same provn. for this as l.a. pension scheme – powers only.

		We are discussing nature of scheme.



P.M.	Gain time :  continue process of education:  RAB to

		talk to dissidents quietly, in groups.



B.H.	Proceed, if all is well, with 2nd.Rdg. in week after next.





	3.	Kenya :  General China.



P.M.	Tel. No. 126.  Some prospect tht. he may bring a large no. to 

		surrender.  But you can’t bargain with a man under sentence

		of death and hang him if he doesn’t come across.



O.L.	No.  I disapprove the whole thing.  But I must leave it to the Govr.

		He will get a bad bargain if only a few come across &amp; you have		to let him off.





	4.	Egypt.



P.M.	Tel. No. 28 from Khartoum.

	Any truth in story of disturbance in s. of Sudan?



S.Ll.	No informn.



P.M.	V. disagreeable development.





	5.	Four Power Meeting.



P.M.	Ends this week.  AE. returns Friday 3 p.m.

	Satisf. tht. it ends in relatively good atmosph., tho’ nil achieved.



Sal.	Has at least demonstrated tht. R. won’t move on A. or G.



P.M.	Heard tht. their reason for obstinacy is mil. not pol.  That Malenkov

		wd. have made some concession but Zhukov was against it

		because it wd. involve re-casting whole of mil. dispositions.



P.M.	Suggest to A.E. mtg. of Cab. last in p.m. of Monday.

				                     [Exit  B.H.

				[Enter D.E., G.Ll., Low.

	6.	Atomic Energy:  Uranium from Congo.



Sal.	New situation because failure to get agreemt. with Australia.

	Moreover, Cab. in earlier discn. were under misapprehension re dollar/

		sterling consequences of C.D.A. agreemt.  Recommend we now

		go back to 50% basis.  There is in fact no way out of that.



Al.	Only $2 m. p.a.  Not too bad.



R.A.B.	Agree it’s inevitable.

	But hope we shall make some modest purchases fr. Canada - &amp; keep

		Austr. possibilities in mind.



Sal.	Will look into Can. possibility.  As regds A., it’s their fault not ours.



Sw.	Mustn’t have it said tht. C.D.A. supplies prevent us from taking 

		supplies fr. A. when available.



R.A.B.	Keep possibility open re Austr. and do somethg (small) with Canada.

		For Comm. reasons.



			Memo. approved, subject to point re Doms.

					  [Exit  D.E., GLl.

					  [Enter  J.T.

	7.	East/West Trade.



P.T.	Agreed short list :  as what we wd. want.  Agreed also on tactics.

	Outstanding questions :  Copper.  At least don’t let us embargo

		semi-fabricated.

		Craven Bros.  Machine Tools.  Two are not embargoed now.

		If we omit altogether, shall have to defend on basis of new

		policy.

		Shipping :  A new memo. by Admy. will be submitted.  This

		can wait.



	Tactics.  Agreed now we present this as new policy.



	Copper.

P.M.	They can assure mil. needs by giving them priority.

	Denial will hamper industrial developmt. generally.

	Hope copper may be excluded.



	Machine Tools.

O.L.	There was much discn. re rubber, at that time.  I developed argumt.

	(applicable to copper) tht. rubber goes into much that isn’t war

		potential.  On that a/c I wd. now agree to exclude copper

		fr. embargo.

	But the 3 machine tools are different.  Most people wd. regard them

		as directly useful to munitions prodn.  They are for v. heavy

		planing &amp; boring operations.  Wd. continue to embargo the

		v. large types.



P.T.	One is embargo-ed now.  The other two aren’t – merely quantitative

		control.

	Cd. we m’tain embargo on the one :  but don’t elevate other two to

		embargo.  Wd. be diff to get G. to agree to that.



Low.	Vertical borers are vital.  Shd. be embargo-ed.

	The other 2 aren’t quite so vital.  Planing machines, particularly, cd. go

		because armour-plate planing machines are subject to embargo.

	Wd. like to keep centre lathes subject to embargo.



P.M.	Don’t stultify our past on tools :  will make it more diff. with U.S.

			Agreed :   3 extra tools shd. be subject to embargo.



	Copper.

Low.	R. wd. be short in war.  We shd. therefore prevent them fr. bldg. 

		a war stock.  Propose we embargo copper, but free fabricated

		so long as orders were linked with other supplies.



Sw.	Comm. interest in free-ing it.  Large producers.

	Low’s line really falls back to war potential argument.

	Copper is back on Metal Exchange :  wd. be awkward to apply special

		arrangemt. to it.



O.L.	They cd. stock-pile via semi-fabricated, tho’ at higher cost.



P.M.	If we aim at peace, it is wrong to deny them so essential an element

		in ordinary industrial prodn.



O.L.	Why stop at copper.  Sulphur is as important.



W.	200,000 t. surplus of copper is likely.  R. will get it somehow.

		Let them get it thro’ Ldn. market.



Sal.	Will it go thro’ from R. to China?



Al.	Willing to accept Cab. decn.  But omission of copper will discredit

		our List with U.S.



S.Ll.	Support this view.  Mght prejudice our chances on whole List.



P.T.	May have to make a concession.  But it’s logical to start without

		copper.



SLl.	Method presentation.

	Mght be mistake to ask Stassen here.  He is known to be ahead of

		p. opinion.  Don’t want Paris group to know Anglo/U.S. talks

		are being held first.



P.M.	Stassen is best judge of his own position.

	Not impressed by argument re Paris group.  He cd. go to Paris, too.

		Let’s ask his opinion.

				[Enter  A.H., de L.

				[Exit  Low.

	8.	Service Pay.



R.A.B.	Date of announcement.

	Diff. to avoid doing it in debates on Service Estimates.  But that is

		v. awkward for M/L.



W.M.	There are startling comparisons with civil industry.  E.g. –

	218/= to 239/=  engineers.

	310/= for W.O. in R.A.F.    250/=  Sergt.    275/=  Staff Sergt.

	Therefore diff. to avert this comp. argumt. at critical stage.



P.M.	They haven’t same freedoms – e.g. to strike or take leave.



W.M.	Yes :  but needs careful presentn.  And will make it diff. for

		employers in argument.

	Hope therefore that Serv. Ministers will consult me on presentn.

	Timing.  I wd. prefer to delay.

			Agreed :   Serv. Ministers to consult M/L. on presentn.



Al.	Timing.  Leak in D. Express &amp; D.T.  “Times” contemplating leader.

		Can’t hope to hold this much longer.

	Propose P.M. shd. announce in defence debate on 2/3.  Wh. Paper

		to be published on same day.

			Agreed :   Announce in Def. Debates, as proposed.

				[Exit  J.T., de L.



				[Enter  C.I.G.S., Att. G.



	9.	Kenya :  Forced Labour.



O.L.	Since memo. discns. with Dpts. concerned.  Agreemt. reached on 

		amendment wh. avoid techn. breach.

	Prob. need not now pay normal wage rates.



W.M.	Welcome this amendment.  It wd. make it much more defensible.



J.S.	What if some refuse to work?



O.L.	Experience suggests tht. they may be persuaded.  Failing that,

		punishment e.g. low diet.



			Memo. approved, subject to amendment agreed

			       between Dpts.

			                                           [Exit  CIGS., A.H., Att. G.



	10.	British Honduras.



O.L.	Guatemalan For. Minister sent his trousers to cleaners &amp; this

		document was found in it.

	We shd. publish.  Wd. like to say at once tht. its authenticity will

		at once be tested by a commn. of enquiry.  We cd. wait to see

		wtr. it is challenged.  But I think it’s sure to be challenged.



Sw.	How long wd. it take to examine authenticity?

	If not long, why not do it first?



P.M.	Wiser to be sure before we publish.



H.C.	Especially after what H/C said re B. Guiana evidence.



S.Ll.	Wd. sooner wait until after confce. of S. Am. States in Caracas on 1/3.



O.L.	It wd. all come out when enquiry starts.  Cdn’t avoid publicity.



Sim.	How do you test authenticity?



W.	Start a general enquiry – &amp; let this paper come out in course of it.



O.L.	Yes :  can start quietly.



S.Ll.	Won’t it involve p’poning elections, due in Apl.



O.L.	Depends what comes out.



M.F.           	x| Limit it to links betwn. P.U.P. &amp; Guatemala &amp; produce this

	  |	as one of items of evidence.

			Agreed – as at x/.	[Exit  S.Ll.

				[Enter I. McL.

	11.	National Food Survey.



Ll.G.	Addn. to f. allowances has not checked deterioration in diet of

		large families.

	Publn. wd. help us to rebut Socialist claim tht o.a.p. are suffering.

		But wd. open us to new criticism re larger families.



R.A.B.	Publish and pig. it.  We have no alternative.



I.McL.	Such indep. evce. as we have confirms this finding.  E.g. weights.

	Food &amp; Nutrition Cttee. shd. be asked to advise on remedies before

		publn. of these Rpts.



Sal.	Is the money being spent rightly?



Ll.G.	Para. 5 gives part answer.  They do spend higher proportion on food.



F.H.	Children won’t drink ⅔rds. pint.  Many of them won’t drink ⅓rd.

		Wdn’t keep until p.m.  Shall be attacked for raising price of

		school meals.



P.M.	Let Rpts be published &amp; see what reactions there are.

		Food &amp; Nutrition Cttee. to consider &amp; report (quickly).

					[Exit  McL.





	12.	Betting and Lotteries.



M.F.	Motion won’t be moved this week.  Less urgent therefore.

	But Leeds:  Supt., Inspr. &amp; 4 Sergts. have had to be sacked.  When

		that is known I shall have to hold enquiry into Force.

	C/Ede has expd. support for cash betting, primarily.  Want to see

		wtr he has support of his colleagues.  Explore chance of doing

		this on bi-partisan basis.

	Must be able, when it is next discussed, to give some faint indications

		of Govt. attitude.



			                 Resume at a later mtg.





	13.	International Labour Conference, 1952.



W.M.	As in memo.

	No legislation involved.



			Approved.
