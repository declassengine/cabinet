C.C. 107(52)							22nd December, 1952



		1.	Persian Gulf.				 

						[Enter C.O.S., 3 Serv Ministers., GLl.



A.E.	Part of legacy of Abadan.  Despatch from Hay circd. on 4/11 brings that out.



	Effect on Qatar and Kuwait.

	Arbitn. offered.  Doubt if they will accept.  They will play it long &amp; seek to detach these States from us by bribes etc.  We have important oil interests.  Sultan of Muscat has lost his authy. over these Sheikdoms.

	I.P. Co. are puttg. up fair amount of money.  We must increase levies, &amp; show the flag if our posn. isn’t to be whittled away.

	Armoured cars.  R.A.F. squadron.  Visit by H.M. ship.  Increase levies to 3/400.  

Provide cadre of force of 200 to be raised by Sultan of M.

Not much at this stage.  But warn Cab. tht. it may involve us in doing more.

	U.S. behaving quite well up to date.  But nervous of upsetting Ibn Saud.

	If Cab. give general approval, F.O. with M/D. can work out details.

	

Alex.	Not much involved at this stage.  R.A.F. can move from Iraq.  Will take a month to arrive.  Any threat of force must be accompanied to will to use it.

	We must get on quickly with levies – will take some time to improve them.



Ch.	Cdn’t U.S. take stronger line with Saudis?	) A.E. But U.S. are

							) dependent on Saudi oil.

P.M.	They have substantial oil interests in Gulf	) 

	oil also.					)



Sal.	Need to be firm.



R.A.B.	Strong support for A.E.’s line.

	If Ibn Saud dies, disruption wd. involve raids on Sheikdoms.



C.A.S.	Local Arab is the answer, backed up by us.  Cdn’t we send a wing of Aden levies – mobile &amp; conditioned to climate.  Can’t keep B. forces there indefinitely.  Cd. bring squadron along in emergency.  Wd. O.L. press Gov/Aden further on this.



A.E.	Consider this suggn. at mtg. with C.O. F.O. M/Def.



Sw.	Want to inform Doms. in advance, incldg. I/Pak.



A.E.	Want to do this quietly.



P.M.	Do this at about double the scale now envisaged.  Must be strong – in most silent fashion.  Tell I./P. as &amp; when for civility.



							[Exit de L’l. C.A.S. 1st 						S.Ld. GL.l.

		2.	Gurkhas : Recruitment.



Sw.	W.O. want to see 7 years’ ahead = term of recruitment.



Alex.	Support.



O.L.	8 Battns. out of 23 in Malaya are Gurkhas.



P.M.	Tell Nehru tht. if he interferes he will get no arms fr. us in future.

	Make it a major issue with him.

							[Exit V.C.I.G.S., A.H.



		Agreed :	Bring major pressure, threateng.

				no more arms etc.





		3.	Sudan.



A.E.	Unhelpful statement by Neguib.  Have spoken to Fawzi about that.

	Later telegram shows better attitude by E. Govt. who are now sending some people to look around in the South.  Can’t give way on that : if necessary, we must break on it.

	Powers of Govr. in emergency.  Believe we shall get that.

	Third ques. concerns retentn. of B. officials.  Sudanese may want to keep them.  Believe we shall get that.

	Final ques : wthr. Commn. arrangemt. be referred to S. Parlt.

	Probably E. are right in saying this is for co-domini not for S. Parlt.



O.L.	Commn.  of gt. interest to me.  P.3(ii).  Repercussions on Colonies, esp. in n. Africa, of putting Govr’s reserve powers into commission.  Hope these will be kept in mind.



A.E.	Yes : but posn. is difft.  This isn’t a Colony.  Commn. will be operatg. on behalf of co-domini.



J.S.	On last point, it wd. be reasonable to consult Parlt.  But don’t break on that.  Generally agreed.



A.E.	If we get agreemt. on Sudan, we shall have to go on with Defence discussions.



P.M.	I want to see the pp. on this.



Sal.	We are all commd. to principle tht. B. occupn. of Egypt shd. give place to a M.E.D.O.

H.M.	That means no occupn. of E. by any troops save those which E. welcomes – as U.S. are welcomed into U.K.





		4.	Central African Federation.



O.L.	We can’t go back on this.  Our prestige is at issue.  Lab. Govt. tried to persuade when they shd. have led.  No vocal African favours fedn. &amp; they are misled by propaganda suggestg. that via C.O. rule they will get somethg. à la Rhodesia.

	We must now go fwd. on basis tht. this is to be imposed.

	Troubles fr. weakness now will be greater than those fr. firmness.

	Must stand firm on safeguards for Africans.  If we give more, the plebiscite in S. Rhodesia will go wrong.  If we give less, we shall lose Labour Party support.

	Will cause tempy. troubles in these territories – e.g. strike in N. Rhodesia &amp; some rioting.  Ugly situation for 2 mos.



Sw.	Support that view.  Ultimate trouble will be worse if we don’t act now.

	This is opportunity for real partnership betw. black &amp; white in Africa.

	If we don’t, S. Rhodesia will join Malan.



Sal.	A victory for extremists on both sides if we back down.



P.M.	We must be resolved &amp; united in seeing this through.  Are we?



		Agreed : we all are so resolved.





		5.	Persia.



A.E.	Agreed with Acheson on modifn. designed merely to satisfy M. that the arbitn. award wdn’t be so v. great.

	Acheson’s other line was $500 m. to A.I.O.C. in oil via arbitn.  We don’t favour that approach.  U.S. argue we may get more money by arbitn.  We don’t want it in principle.  Eventually I think U.S. may make such an offer – can’t stop them : we shall then have to say ‘No’ and that wd. be parting of ways with U.S. over Persia.

	Warn Cabinet that this may happen.
