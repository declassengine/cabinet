C.C. 102(52).							4th December, 1952



		Foreign Affairs.



P.M.	Unique expce. – preside at Cab. attended by repves. of Comm.  grave matters affectg. all our lives – immense power to influence course of f. affairs.



A.E.	Germany.  Ad. battle for closer union with Eur.

	Saar:  month ago in sight of agreemt.  Solved pol., but failed on econ. wh. is imp. to France who w’out Saar coal can’t be balancg. factor in Schumania.  Since electn. better chance.  Sch. has replied to Ad. makg. reasonable offers.  Shall pursue it during NATO



	Russia.  Content with G. sitn. – consol. in East while we do in W.

	Tho’ division unsatisf., it really suits a no. of us quite well.

	R. believes she can stand cold war better than us – increase our diffies. &amp; drive wedge betwn. us &amp; U.S.



	Czechoslovakia.  Mainly due to econ. diffies. – failing econ. plans : also internal divns. w’in Comm. Party.  R. doesn’t like excessive concentn. of power in one man or group.



	Similar trials coming in Rumania &amp; Hungary – Dep. P.M.’s.

	In Cz. it may reflect incipient Tito-ism, being nipped in bud.

	Jews behind Curtain.  No concl. evce. tht. this is anti-J. movemt.

	In R. &amp; Cz. J. have bn. in trouble : but not in Bulg. or Hung.  But Moscow is strongly anti-Zionist – mainly because dislike people leaving for Israel.



	E.D.C. Treaties.  G. votes at end/wk.  Ad. expected to have majority.  Then court, wh. won’t prob. upset.  Will therefore be ratified by G. before end/year.



	France : more uncertain.  Govt. may fall.  Further undertakgs. fr. us may be sought.  Tho’ don’t see what more we cd. do – we can’t become members.  Some in Fr. think U.K. wd. come in if a looser non- federal plan were launched – we discourage this de novo start.

	Fr. have all reasonable guarantees : what frightens them now is loss of sep. Fr. Army &amp; strain of Indo. Ch. war.  They aren’t bldg. up effective Army in Europe.  But if E.D.C. doesn’t go through, case for admittg. G. to N.A.T.O. cd. not be denied.



P.M.	Soldiers won’t fight for cosmopolitan idea – for his own country &amp; home.

	I was against eliminatg. natl. spirit fr. E.D.C. – on this as well as practical grounds : language, weapons etc.,  But Fr. were bitten by federal idea.  I wdn’t be sad therefore if E.D.C. failed &amp; Germany came into N.A.T.O.



A.E.	That wd. be better militarily, but not politically for French.



	Austria.  Shan’t get solution because R. won’t w’draw.

	But improvemt. in relns. betwn. A. &amp; Balkans, largely because Y are havg. mil. talks with neighbours – beginning with Austria, then Greece &amp; T.

	These are going well.  Fr. U.S. &amp; U.K. also opening staff talks with Y.

	The snag is Trieste, wh. symbolises Y/Ital. strains.

	Thought I cd. get agreement on Zones, A. to Italy.  B. to Y.

	Tried to get U.S. to press this on Italy but they wdn’t because of Pr. Elections.

	Now U.S. want us &amp; Fr. to press Y. to accept modificn. re Capodistria.



	Don’t like this idea.  It will leak before It. elections.  Also new U.S. Govt. may take a diff. view.



	Turkey.  Visit here was successful.  Relns. are more cordial than ever.

	They want to return for Coronation.



	Egypt.  Defence &amp; Sudan.  Farouk’s departure has eased situation.  N. has abandoned claim to unity under E. Crown.  Trouble over S. Sudan, wh. is less advanced &amp; tends to split away fr. N.  We therefore think Gov. Genl. shd. retain some powers over S. for a time.  If we reach agreemt., early elections under Commn. with Indians &amp; U.S. repves. as well as U.K. &amp; Eg.

	On later advisory body Pak. will be repd.

	Defence is more diff.  Tho’ N. now says no discn. until we have gone, I believe he will in end be ready to talk on this while we balk on M.E.D.O.



P.M.	Violence in E. last year.  Socialists put up 4 Power Plan.  That remains our policy.  Our burden in M/E. is v. heavy : shd. welcome help of other countries in defending intern. waterway.  Can’t carry burden alone.

	Seek dignified method of sharing this burden.



A.E.	Worried by econ. diff. of E.  Diff. in selling cotton.  N. won’t last unless econ. strength improves.  We don’t need the cotton.

	Grateful to A.N.Z. &amp; S.A. for their share in M/E. defence.



	M/East.  Syria have asked for Treaty.

	Trucial Sheikdoms.  Troublesome.

	Persia.  Split in Nat. Front.  Tudeh and others may combine v. M.

	May come quite soon.  Talk with Eisenhower on oil dispute.  U.S. Govt. thinkg. now of $30m. offer to secure settlement.  Won’t work until after pol. upheaval.



M.	Why do you insist on Court?  



A.E. 	Originally, U.S. idea wh. we accepted.  We don’t expect large sum.  But thought it fairest method of fixing compensn.



A.E.	S.E.A.  Malaya improving, but Indo.China is not.  Serious for Burma &amp; Siam.  U.S. helping Fr. (50% of cost, they say) in money &amp; supplies.  Will China intervene directly?  We think not.



	Korea.  Jap sitn. needs watchg.  Comm. pull fr. China will be strong, esp. in trade.  J. popn. increasg. at 1 m. p.a.

	Eisenh. said going solely for mil. review : no pol. decisions.  Some U.S. wd. like to use Japs : but S. Koreans hate them more than Chinese.



	Some wd. like to use Chang’s troops : only 2 Divns, however.  Hope it won’t be done – pol. troubles wd. outweigh any mil. advantage.

	Choice: continue holdg. opn. with increased S. K. troops.

	Seek to destroy Ch. Army by opns. up to Yalu.

	Second wd. be costly – U.S. unlikely to wish for it.

	F. Affairs is holding opn. all round.  Grateful for Indian inititive in U.N.

	Hope we shall persist in it.  Thanks too for Pearson’s help.

	Can only try to consolidate non-Comm. nations.



P.M.	Cease fire pending negotns. over p.o.w.?  



A.E. 	Shd. never get p.o.w. away then.

	Also, fear build-up during cease fire.



P.M.	Relations with U.S.  a corner stone of policy.  Our ½ world – stretchg. out a hand to other E. spkg. people.



A.E.	New Adminn. – Ike is choosing well.  His views on Eur. are unchanged.

	Assured me tht. he wished to work with Comm. &amp; France.



P.M.	Thanks to A.E. for general review.  Welcome others’ views.



St.L.	A.E. has just returned from U.N.  We were all encouraged by India’s initiative over K.  Glad to see they got 55 votes for their resolution.

	Encouraging demonstn.



M.	Cool U.K. Press receptn. of Dulles’ appointmt. was unfortunate. If warmer response were given he mght be more f’coming.

	Complexity &amp; respons. of A.E.’s task.  Regional diffies. as well as world trouble.  Many signs of improvemt. in last 12 mos.

	We are grateful for A.E.’s knowl, perception, wisdom.



Hav.	Thanks for review.  His policy will carry S.A. approval.  To keep us out of further war.  Don’t like U.N. attitude : we are doing our share in Korea for U.N. principles &amp; shall do so despite heavy cost.



Des.	Situation shows signs of improvemt.  Indo-Ch. &amp; Korea – trouble spots.  We have fewer illusions re China than is sometimes thought.  Agree unlikely Ch. will go directly into Indo-Ch.

	They have more than they can chew on the north.

	Situatn. there must be contd. – U.S. will have to carry it.  Will they tire?



	Korea.  3rd choice extensn. by conflict.  Cdn’t be localised.  Risk of sudden extension beyond control.  Expect that will be discarded.

	Cease-fire gives Ch. time.

	Peace is only safe objective.  Strength &amp; continuing resistance.

	Heavy price for U.S. to pay.  Casualties are heavy : &amp; U.S. are sensitive to them.  Can see no alternative, unless one can get (uneasy) peace on lines of our resolution.



P.M.	We oppose blockade because of risk of conflict with R.

	Want opns. confined to Korea.  Large armies in China.



Sen.	Thanks for survey.



Holl.	Thanks.  V. useful to me.

	Small country – made best contn. we can in Korea.

	Have sent a force to M/E. : they are now in Cyprus.

	This sort of survey is most valuable – shd. like to hear it more often.

	In N.Yk., A.E.’s personal presence secured agreemt. on Indian resoln. of gt. value &amp; importance to the world.

	Experience here will help to consolidate Comm.



Naz.	Join in chorus of compliment to A.E. – on review &amp; on U.N. achievement.

	But remember tht. resoln. won’t end K. conflict.

	Danger of complacency.  If we assume R. preparg. for a war, R.’s present procedure is v. dangerous for us.  Softening up their opponents.  Weakening powers arrayed v. her.  Fr. in Indo-China &amp; is being bled white.  U.K. in Malaya &amp; elsewhere finds resources seriously strained.  In Korea even U.S. is finding diffy. – longing for an end to it : tiring of it.



	Genl. sitn. therefore is weakening all-round of countries opposing R.

	Can’t say what counter-moves shd. be made.  But we shd. try to consolidate our posn. more effectively.  Get our friends more ready for struggle if it comes.  Where diffies. exist, they shd. be resolved quickly – so tht. if war shd. come we may face it united.



G.H.	No comments.  Thanks for review.



P.M.	Mtg. in Map Room &amp; consider mil. aspects of situation before P.M.’s leave.  Look particularly at places where we have common dangers &amp; interests.  Review by Alex.  Can we fit that in?



	My ideal for Canal wd. be internatl. control with token forces &amp; prs. an Egyptian C-in-C.



A.E.	Thanks for compliments.

	Objective in F/E. policy : divide China fr. Russia.  That was why I welcomed Indian resoln. – on those lines.  May take years.

	Agree with N. tht. U.S. is tiring.  But remember tht. K. called into being U.S. Army &amp; Air Force &amp; prodn.
