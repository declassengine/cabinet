C.C. 3 (54)					18th January, 1954



						[Enter B-C., B-H.

163.	    Parliament.



H.C.	Business for this week.





1.	    Housing.



H.M.	318,750 houses built in 1953.  Will be published in February.





1.	Parliament (resumed)

165)	

Sw.	Stansgate is raising debate in H/L. on Wed. re mil. aid for Pakistan.

	Awkward to ask him not to – wd. come out that we had done so.

	Must therefore face &amp; answer it:  viz., say that we welcome it &amp; see no harm in it :  India has received much larger econ. aid fr. U.S.



A.E.	Yes :  but the less said, the better.  Awkward qua R. &amp; 4 Power Mtg.

And avoid any reference to the Turkey/Pakistan propsn.





1.	    Four-Power Meeting

166)	

A.E.	Decn. on adminve. arrangemts. not unsatisf. – but length of negotn. on this augers ill for mtg.

	Bidault has written firm letter (F.O. 137 to Paris) – recalling tht. we can’t accept 2:2 principle generally e.g. in relation to forces.

Agree with that.  This was only matter of mechanics.

	Crux will be free elections.  R. will try to avoid real freedom – e.g. by suggesting the 2 G. Govts. do it alone w’out foreign supervision.

	Release of Korean p.o.w. will cause trouble wh. will re-act on Mtg.

Indian ryder tht. they shd. remain in custody was wrong :  but our action in releasing ours will provoke Communists.

Two anxieties i) Chinese p.o.w. are to go to Formosa :  they weren’t consulted.

			ii) those returned to Rhee are to be “re-indoctrinated”.

		But on i) it’s true there was nowhere else to send.



P.M.	Wish you luck.

	It was not your plan :  but you have to bear burden &amp; the bleak prospect.

	No blame will attach to you for initiatg. this.  Sal. agreed, with my approval, because seemed to be only prospect of a meeting or point/contract.

Hope it won’t be confined to barren discn. of G.



A.E.	Satisf. if we held w. posn. generally &amp; make way for continuing tech. discn. on G. &amp; A.  Also in coulisses get some idea fr. M. of their general mood.

	Will table precise plan for free elections, if others agree.  Something definite to discuss.  If it all breaks down, we shall have a story to tell to our public.





1.	    Egypt.



P.M.	Amb. talk with E. For. Secy., who showed anxiety re modern arms for Israel.



A.E.	Arab League Mtg. went ill for E.  Iraq &amp; J. standing out for assocn. with West.  We may be able to work with other Arab countries to neglect of E.  Others are nearer to front line.  We may be able to put E. in the cold.



P.M.	What about time-limit for our terms?



A.E.	Cd. say so.  But is it better to leave them to stew?  Prs. it is, if we can get on with arrangemts with Iraq &amp; Jordan., &amp; Turkey.

	Are we in a hurry?  Save for the 80,000.  And unless U.S. send them aid.



P.M.	1) Neutralism has harmed them with U.S.                    } They may be

	2) They have ridded Muslim League as well as Wafd. } feeling more

				          naked. 

A.E.	And riots v. Salem in Khartoum.

	They must be feeling a lonely régime. 



P.M.	No word of counter proposals?



A.E.	No.  Must wait, first, for U.S. to put on their pressure.



P.M.	Any necessary.

			                                              [Enter Molson, Maudling, D.S.



1.	    East-West Trade.



P.M.    	  |  Our policy shd. be to deny to Soviet bloc only goods of direct mil. 

	x|  value &amp; stop trying to hamper growth of their industrial war 

	  |  potential.

	  |  Infiltration, by trade, will weaken Soviet strength &amp; cohesion.



A.E.	No dispute on objects :  only concern is with tactics.

	Doubt wtr we can evoke U.S. response on basis of short-list.

Wiser to go round.



M.	Stassen sees our point tht. list shd. be short &amp; effective.

But it is v. like list U.S. have rejected.  Also we in Ldn. aren’t agreed on it.  Prefer A.E.’s approach.



P.T.	Not easy.

	Cd. we agree policy as at x/.  Also agree a list in W’hall based on that policy.  Their approach to U.S. can be judged as a matter of tactics.



P.M.	Ask Stassen to come here for personal talks.



D.S.	Anxious to increase electrical machinery exports to R.

Wd. like P.T.’s short list ;  but doubt if it will be practicable.



Alex.	Def. Dpts. want to enlarge P.T.’s list.



Sw.	Also concentrate on big-money items e.g. electrical equipment and rubber.



		Agreed: i) adopt policy as at x/ in brief.

			    ii) ask officials to present amended list &amp; arguments pro &amp; con on disputed items.

			    iii) discuss tactics later with Stassen.

		Report to be presented in a Min. Cttee. in a week.



			N.B. to recommend composn. of Min. Cttee. for Thursday’s

			        Cabinet.

					[Exit Maudling

					[Enter G.Ll.

1.	    Nationalised Industries.



L.P.	Sel. Cttee. recommn. for standing Sel. Cttee. on policy &amp; practice of natd. industries.  H.A. Cttee. suggest this be supported, as best means of keeping Parlt. continuously informed.

	What of H/L?  They didn’t appoint a Sel. Cttee. of their own.  They will prob. want a Joint Sel. Cttee.  Two wd. be cumbrous.  Can’t defer H/C. debate until H/L. has considered this.  But hope Govt.

            	x||	spokesmen will keep open possibility of Joint Sel. Cttee.  M’while I will try to get H/L. Sel. Cttee. to consider report of H/C. Sel. Cttee.

	At. En. Corpn. shd. be excluded.  Argument :  money will not be mainly outside Exch. sources, as others.



P.M.	Must not weaken H/C. scrutiny over work of natd. industries.

Shall want this opportunity when in Opposn.

	Natd. industries haven’t bankruptcy incentive to efficiency.

	At En. Corpn shd. certainly be excluded.



G.Ll.	Accept recommn. of H.A. Cttee. as it now stands.



P.M.	See if Opposn. wd. accept Joint Sel. Cttee.

	M’while accept x/.  Can say we are ready to discuss H/L. posn. with Opposn. leaders in both Houses.



D.S.	Shd. not include the de-nationalised Steel industry.

We shd. be ready with the arguments against its inclusion.



			                                                       [Exit Molson, D.S., G.Ll.

		                                                                [Enter de L., Att.G.

1.	    Crichel Down.



M-F.	As in memo.  Summarised recommns.

	“Pre-emptive opportunity”.  Diff. to distinguish betwn. first refusal and right of pre-emption.



Sal.	Disposed to favour pre-emptive opportunity.

Land is taken compulsorily :  if not needed, public auction.

Owner gets therefore no advantage over any other bidder.

Has he not a moral right to some advantage.

Right of pre-emption is rejected because it gives him advantage.

But I believe he shd. have some advantage – not in price, but in opportunity.



J.S.	Statement of policy will have to be made after Crichel enquiry.  He will be in trouble if he can’t say something to that effect.



A.E.	Sympathise :  but how fix the price?



M.F.	Owner, on purchase, will have recd. market value + injurious affection, if any.  On a right of pre-emptn., D Valuer will have to make best guess he can at value.



H.M.	Suppose he has recd. injurious affectn., do you deduct that from re-sale price?



Sal.	Yes.



H.M.	Then he wd. do better at auction.



Sim.	Diff. to give statutory right of pre-emption.  But, if no stat. right can be defined, how give it administratively? 

	Owner has recd. full price.  Why shd. he have advantage, meaning getting for less than a bidder at auction.



Sal.	Varies from case to case.  But may have amenity value for owner wh. it hasn’t for others – e.g. property adjoining his house.

	Agree you can’t give universal statutory right.



W.	Persuaded that it is administratively impracticable.

	Diff. to rely on valuers’ estimate.

	Owner who has recd. injurious affectn. can afford to outbid competitors at auction.



M.F.	Allegns. of rigging it wd. be frequent if sold on valuers’ estimate under pre-emptive opportunity.

	How far down the line do you give the opportunity – if original rights have passed to others.



P.M.	Cd. you say :  sell by auction but owner may claim at auction figure.



			Approve memo. save A(1) and (3), which need further 

			    consideration.  Further thoughts on this are invited – in

			    writing.



de.L.	Test practicability of L.P.’s plan by reference to past sales.



					[Exit de.L.

1.	    Industrial Disputes.



W.M.	1 day strike.  Good response in England :  less good in Scotland.

For. Sc. employers are more sensible.

	No action by me pro. tem.

	Employers have asked me to act under Orders 1306.  But I won’t because workers have said they didn’t attend or abide by findings.  Don’t want to damage arbitn. principle any more at this juncture.

	Must allow it to develop.  Action now wd. involve capituln. or ineffective arbitn. – both wd. be worse than a strike.



P.M.	A bad advert. for comm-run Unions.  They haven’t had a good Press or public receptn.



W.M.	Offl. Opposn. won’t press me to act.

	If employers beat it;  they will be pleased.

	Certainly Rt. Wing T.U. leaders will.

	Doesn’t affect public directly.



		More in offing e.g. provincial buses :  coal-mines.
