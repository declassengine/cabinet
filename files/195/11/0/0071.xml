C.C. 66(53).				13th November, 1953.



	National Service.                                 [Enter  3 Serv. Min., D.S., B-H.



P.M.	H.C. &amp; Ch. Whip agreed tht. Oppn. shd. have Motion on Mon., &amp;

		that our O-in-C. be discussed on Tues.  That is settled.

	Our choice is of evils.  i) Accept Motion, wh. won’t go to Divn.

		unless forced by Pacifists.  Big majority v. 6. or so on Monday.

		But then on Tuesday Pacifists may vote v. our O-in-C. and, if so,

		Opposn. won’t feel able to do more than abstain.  World will

		then see tht. Socialists don’t support 2 years.

	Not shocked by annual affirmn.  cf. Army Act principle.  Also Parlt.

		has many other opportunities to seek a vote on the period.

		Services wd. prefer certainty.  They can’t have that.

		Argument tht. men sign on for 3 yrs. because they know they

		are in for 2 anyhow.  But we cd. say now tht. for rest of this

		Parlt. we shan’t reduce below the 2 years.



A.H.	Our fear is interpn. of acceptce. of motion.  Will be thght. Govt. are

		changing policy.  cf. line taken by P.M. resisting amendmt. in

		March 5 debate.  What has happened to make redn. more 

		likely?  Will discourage 3-year signing on.

	Also, under Socialists, less likely tht. they will continue to up-hold

		a reasonable length of service.

	Man-power, under Rad. Review :  will shrink &amp; no prospect therefore

		of reducing the period.  Unwise to cast doubts on this.



de L.	Support A.H.  Re-engagement is vital to our efficiency.



J.T.	Effect on Allies wd. be bad.  Esp. when we are always urging them in

		EDC etc., to increase their period.



A.E.	Don’t like wording of motion e.g. “time has now arrived” implies

		a new situation.

	Fear they will divide on 2nd. day on O-in-C.

	Shd. we not therefore table amendmt. to their motion.



P.M.	Wd. be a smaller Mon. majority.



W.M.	Period of service.  24 mos. introduced post-Korea in 1950 Act.

		And may be shortened by O-in-C., if circs. change.

		That ques can always be ventilated.

	Motion accepts principle of nat. service.  Will be debateable anyhow.

		Motion only changes basis of debate – aff. resoln.

	Uncertainty arises fr. circs., not fr. acceptce. of this motion.

	Even on re-engagement – man isn’t influenced until period has 

		been changed.

	Accept resoln. :  but make our intns. clear in speeches.



J.S.	Pity to depart so soon from line P.M. took in March.

A.E.	Cd. oppose it on ground tht. “time has not come” to change line we

		took in March.



O.L.	Resist the motion, in conciliatory form, but time has not arrived.



A.E.	Won’t do any internatl. damage to vote v. resoln.



M.F.	M/D. memo. contemplated reducing period acc. to circumstances.

	No real objn. to acceptg. aff. resoln.  Only diffy. is what P.M. said 

		in March.



P.M.	We cd. have accepted this resolution if we hadn’t said

		what we did in March.

		But, having said it then, we can’t reverse our policy now.

		Nothg. has happened in interval to warrant such a change.



	Agreed :	Resist Labour motion.

			3-line Whip on Mon. and Tuesday.
