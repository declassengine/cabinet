C.C. 15(53)							26th February, 1953



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.





H.C.	Business for next week.

	Defence debate – form of Motion.  Opposn. wd. prefer “takes note” vice “approves”.



	We suggested that form ourselves in 1951.



P.M.	Circs. are entirely different.  We wd. not be content with anything short of “approval”, now.  We shd. insist on “approve” even tho’ this invites a reasoned amendment.



R.A.B.	Judges Salaries.  2nd Rdg. before Easter : but cdn’t do Cttee. stage until after.





		2.	Hungary : M. Sanders.			        [Exit B.H.



A.E.	Now suggest consultn. with Pekin before final decision is taken.



P.M.	Am opposed to this still on moral grounds.

	“Cold war” is only a journalistic cliché.  



A.E. 	It is a stark reality.



P.M.	Anyhow it has no juridical foundn. warranting exchange of p.o.w. etc.,



M.F.	Napoleonic precedents?  Civilians arrested after Treaty of Amiens.  Believe we managed to exchange some of them.



O.L.	If I have to bring pressure on Ruler to comment L.M.’s sentence, I want to make it clear to him tht. there is a possibility of exchange.





		3.	Anglo-Soviet Fisheries Agreement.



A.E.	Our fishermen have gone too near R. coast : and R. have denounced Agreemt. – w’out publicly saying so.  I want to threaten, privately, to denounce Comm. Agreemt.



P.T.	Don’t like this because of genl. trade condns.  This Agreemt. does us no good.

	

	Agree tht. A.E. may have latitude to threaten, if he so wishes.







		4.	European Defence Community.



P.M.	Sympathise with de G.’s line – preserve “body &amp; soul” of national Armies in a Grand Alliance.

A.E.	Annex D.  Subject to addn. to para.7.; and some amendmts. agreed with M/D. to meet his N.A.T.O. point.



Al	Agree.   



R.A.B.  	So do I.



		Approved.





		5.	Public Expenditure.



R.A.B.	Vote on A/C. went better than hoped.  Thanks for co-opn. of colleagues.



	But if you add Suppl. we haven’t saved.



P.M.          *	Record skill &amp; resolution shown by M/F. in development of policy.



R.A.B.	Future	i)  Review of Defence Expre. will be crucial.  Can’t spend more.

		ii) Cttee. on civil expre.  Preparing statement for incln. in Budget

		    Speech on fwd. attitude twds. expre.  Will consult Cttee. on 	    that.



 

		6.	Commercial Policy in Europe.



P.T.	(i)  Tourist Allowance &amp; Relaxation of Imports.



	Eur. will restrict our exports to them unless we liberalise somehow.

	This is an easy way.

	When?  Sooner the better.  O.E.E.C. meets on 4/3.  Easter is coming.

	This may forestall restns. by Europe.  Import restns. can await return of A.E. &amp; R.A.B. &amp; decision before second mtg. of O.E.E.C. on 23/3.



R.A.B.	We must relax imports (esp. Italy) to avert retaliation.  Ready to relax up to £30M. as B/T. propose.

	Tourists.  There is a case.  I wd. prefer £35 (O.E.E.C. minimum) or £40.  Ready to have it discussed betw. Dpts.



P.M.	£50.  Disgrace that Englishmen shd. go like beggars thro’ the Europe which they liberated.



R.A.B.	But don’t want tourist concession announced separately from imports.  Shan’t have much to say at O.E.E.C. on 23/3.

	Promise on 4/3 a statement before end/month.

	Only loss &amp; not before Easter.



L.	Arrangemts will have to be made for traffic : need for 6/7 weeks preparations.



P.M.	£50 minimum.  Any appln. to cost £1.  Ballot.  Then a market in allowance units.



A.E.	On 4/3 give indication tht. we are considering relaxations.

	My advisers wd. prefer tourist allowce. to come in on 4/3 : but I don’t press that.  I agree we shall want somethg. good to say on 23/3.

	With £30M. relaxation of trade, I wd. accept £40 vice £50 tourist allowance.



R.A.B.	Don’t want to put it up &amp; have to bring it down again.



P.M.	Prefer to revert to old figure of £50.



R.A.B.	Let it all be worked out &amp; sanctioned finally by Cab. after my return – or earlier if urgent need arises.



		Agreed:	P.T. to prepare recommns. re relaxations

				(with Ty. &amp; F.O.) &amp; submit that &amp; final

				recommn. on amount of tourist allowce

				for Cab. decision.



		(ii)	Long Term.



P.T.	Paras 8-end.  Hope these will be taken into a/c in W’ton talks, &amp; tht. Dpts. may study these suggns. m’while.

	If we do nothing, Schumania will spread.  Better that we shd. take initiative.



P.M.	No harm in that.



Sw.	May be a chance to get somethg. confined to Europe, w’out m.f.u. throughout the world.



R.A.B.	Bear this in mind in W’ton talks.



H.M.	These pp. are of v. gt. importance as bringing us into Europe again instead of being crowded out by Schumanian methods.



P.M.	“With not in” applies here as to E.D.C. etc.





		7.	Germany : Former Nazis.			[Enter Att.G.



A.E.	K. reports enough evce. to warrant charge of conspiracy v. group : also espionage v. Bormann.  We cd. prefer other charges later, when all documents examined.



	Authorised him to explain sitn. to A., show him evce. &amp; ask wthr. he will take procdgs.  If asked, K. can say tht. we might be prepared to consider procdgs. in a Br. court.



	When charges preferred, free access to counsel will be allowed.

	Appeal will be heard on 5/3.  Prs. before then it will have bn. decided to charge them.



						                      [Exit Att.G.

		8.	Film Industry.



P.T.	Somethg. like levy must go on, but must dissociate it from Budget.

	Hence plan for forcing industry to make voluntary scheme.



R.A.B.	Support this plan.



H.C.	Must a threat of legn. be used at this stage?



P.T.	I fear so.  W’out that I can’t get them off the Budgetary concession.



H.C.	Premature to prepare the legn. anyhow.  Next Session.



P.M.	Only a preliminary sketch : don’t press draftsmen if they are busy.





		9.	Egypt.



P.M.	Read Eisenhower’s reply., and his own answer.





		10.	East/West Trade.



A.E.	Things which will affect Anglo-U.S. relations –

	Ships carrying strategic goods to China wh. can bunker in B. ports.

	Tankers re-fuelling in H.Kong.

	Freedom for ships chartered by Communists to get H.K. registry.



L.	Ships on time-charters to a foreign country are beyond our control.

	We hamper them by refusing bunkering facilities.



P.T.	We have a good case on trade.

	Don’t be pushed into doing more than other Europ. countries.



P.M.	This may all be considered by Cab. on Tuesday – with a view to giving A.E. some concessions to trade with.





		11.	Mission to Washington.



		Cabinet’s good wishes.



		12.	Coronation : Bracelets.



Sw.	U.K. shd. be in too, if asked.
