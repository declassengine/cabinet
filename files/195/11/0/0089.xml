C.C. 6(54).				28th January, 1954.



			                              [Enter  B.C., B-H., A.H., de L., J.T.

	1.	Parliament.                                           AL.B., S.Ll.



H.C.	Oppn. have suggd. debate on rifle, on Mon. after 7. p.m.



P.M.	V. well.  S. of S. for war shd. open :  but I mght. say a few words.





	2.	Egypt.



P.M.	V. interesting memo.  Favour course (c) - to be adopted if either 

		E. refuse our terms or delay so long tht. we w’draw them.

	Like idea of falling back on 1936 Treaty.

	Then we must keep it.  Reduce to 10,000.  That no. wdn’t enable us

		to go into Cairo or Alex.  But cd. hold 2 ends of Canal, incldg.

		control over Cairo’s oil.  Our supporters wd. be content with

		that.  E. wd. see our evacuation &amp; mght become more friendly :

		then we mght negotiate a new agreement with them.

	No good leaving our 10,000 as a bait – or exposing them to undue

		risk.  Wd. they be safe enough?



Al.	Two maps.

	With 10,000 we cd. hold perimeter posn. at Suez.  Tho’ if activity

		opposed by E. cdn’t defend whole Base area or guarantee to

		keep Canal open.

	If E. were not hostile we cd. move some light stores fr. Base.

	With E. co-opn. we cd. move more.

	With E. hostile :  guerrillas, we cd. move some :  E. Army we shd.

		have to stop dismantling Base.

	E. Army are short of weapons &amp; ammunn. &amp; cdn’t m’tain

		protracted opns.  But they may fight well, out of rancour.

	From Suez perimeter we cd. exercise negative control over Canal &amp;

		positive control over E.’s oil.

	10,000 wd. be a small divn.  Cd. be re-inforced by air fr. Cyprus 

		(brigad) &amp; by armd. brigade fr. Libya:  &amp; if necessary fr. U.K. 

		thro’ 	Tobruk.

	Airport 7 miles n. of Suez – wd. have to be w’in perimeter.

		Make landing strips nearer Suez.

	Will work out detailed plans for this – for readiness if needed.



A.H.	Suez is outside Treaty area for Army.



Sal.	Wd. meet Tory critics.

	But what wd. be declared object of our policy?

	Treaty envisaged our troops for Anglo-E. defence?



S.Ll.	No :  for liberty of Canal.



Sal.	Shan’t be able to keep Canal open thus.  Can we say its our purpose?

	Real purpose is to threaten E. - &amp; we cdn’t admit that.



Sw.	Have we a case under Treaty, if taken to U.N. for troops at Suez?



Al.	No.  But no room for 10, 000 at Ismailia.



A.H.	Wd. take 12 mos. to reduce to 10,000.  Shd. have that time in wh. to

		assess E. intentions.



de L.	Cd. supply Fayid by air?



Al.	Dangerous.  E. cd. cut our water.  And we cdn’t cut their oil.



Sim.	If taken to U.N., we cdn’t justify our presence in Suez – or indeed

		anywhere in E. after 1956.



H.C.	Once we cease negotg., m’tenance of troops to “enforce our rights”

		under Treaty wd. be in effect an act of war.



S.Ll.	Treaty lasts until Dec. ’56.

	They have denounced Treaty:  can they plead it?

	In U.N. it wd. be Security Council, incldg. T. &amp; N.Z. – who cd. veto.

		And we cd veto any action decided upon.



Sal.	Favour this policy – if F.O. can find means of defending its legality.



ALB.	Cd. we m’tain tht. troops at Suez (not Fayid) are nec. for our duty to

		guard Canal?



P.M.	Redeploymt. &amp; redn. of nos. wd. be gratifying to E. opinion.  Need we

		assume their continuing hostility.



S.Ll.	Tel. 117 fr. Cairo.  U.S. have made their repns. – strongly.

	A.E. still thinks agreement is better than course (c) in my memo.



P.M.	We shall have to accept agreemt. on those terms if E. will have them.



S.Ll.	U.S. action affects my memo.  They have done para. 10(a) and (b).

		No occasion for any further prod to them.



P.M.	We must have a plan for falling back on Treaty.

	Suppose they break off negotns., we must be ready.



M.F.	Must explore posn. – Treaty denounced by E. unilaterally.  Can’t

		other party make disposns. to protect its rights?  We have people

		there:  doesn’t that give us right to decide how they shd. be 

		protected – with some discretion on location.  Cd. we not argue

		tht. only safe place is Suez.  They, havg. denounced Treaty, can’t

		plead its limitn. re location.  If they seek to revive Treaty we can

		say we wish to discuss locns. with them in new circs.

	If we were taken to U.N., cdn’t we use some of these arguments?

		And those set out in (c) of A.E.’s memo. offering arbitn.

	We cd. discuss all this over 2/3 years, while re-deploymt. was 

		continuing.

	Wd. involve minimum loss of prestige.



Sim.	Doubt legality of that line.  Sending or deploying troops to protect

		our rights under a Treaty denounced is v. like an act of war.



M.F.	Only steps to protect troops entitled to be there under Treaty.



P.M.	If they accept our terms we must make the agreemt.  Commd. on this

		to U.S., let alone Egypt.

	If they break off – by refusal or inordinate delay – we fall back on 

		1936 Treaty.

	Let a Cttee. consider how security of 10,000 can best be safeguarded

		with some regard to provns. of Treaty.  They must be in a posn.

		where they can defend themselves, if attacked, until re-inforced –

		even if it’s not the best military position.  Can min. mil. need be

		reconciled with legal consns. arising fr. Treaty.

	Bringing in our duty to protect Canal.



		Cab. Cttee. to consider this problem –

			M-F., Sim., M/State, M/Def., S of S. for War &amp; Air, A.L.B.





	3.



ALB.	Are we reachg. stage for reviving project of concert of mar. Powers to

		consider Canal?  Hope F.O. will keep in mind timing of that.



			                                             [Exit  BH., Serv. Min., ALB.



					[Enter  Watk.

	4.	Royal Commission on Lunacy.



P.M.	P.Q. to-day.  Shan’t announce names because they haven’t yet bn. 

		invited.

		General view:  good &amp; well-balanced list of names.





	5.	Industrial Disputes.



Watk.	Private buses.  Mtg w’in normal machinery on Fri.  If no progress

		then shall have to appoint ct. of enquiry.

	Light castings.  Ban on overtime p’poned until engin. ct. of enquiry

		reports.

	Coal-miners have accepted award.

			                                                [Enter  P.T., H.H., Maudling.

	6.	Japan.



M.	E. Afr. has reduced their imports fr. J. more than the addn. we propose

		for U.K.  On balance Lancs. wd. gain.  Esp. as it wd. be finished

		here and re-exported.



W.	Lancs. won’t like this.  But they always resent any J. competn. – &amp; they

		have exaggerated it.



P.T.	They will make a row about this.  But I support it.



H.H.	E. Africa has increased its imports fr. Lancs because they cdn’t wait

		for this agreemt.



			Memo. Approved.





	7.	British Industries Fair.



P.T.	Real point:  how explain, when challenged, tht. we didn’t invite them.

		Singling them out as only nation not to be invited.

	|  F.O. are on record as saying we want to encourage trade in non-

                      x|     strategic goods with China.



S.Ll.	We haven’t invited them before :  this isn’t the time to make a change.



P.T.	We did in 1951.

	Anyway, what about x/?

	The Comm. organn. for trade has bn. closed down by F.O., on ground

		tht. trade shd. go thro’ individual firms.



Sal.	This is not the moment.  Wd. embarrass U.S.  Advantage to us wdn’t

		out-weigh that.



Sw.	Say “we didn’t do it last year or 1952 : this is not a good moment 

		to start”.



P.M.	That is good enough:  stand on it.



S.Ll.	Prob. 1951 invitns. sent before Ch. intervened in Korea.
