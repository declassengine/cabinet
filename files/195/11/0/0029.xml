C.C. 21(53).				20th March, 1953.



	1.	R.A.F. Loss of Bomber.                          [Enter  Ll.G., T.D., de L.



de L.	Now establd. tht. bomber was unarmed &amp; cd. not have returned fire.

		Shooting was unprovoked – and prob. w’out warning.

	Bomber was off course.  Rear gunner thght. he was over Hamburg

		&amp; shot down by U.S. fighters.

	Some ammo. on board – collected by R. and displayed to our 

		experts who came to see it 4 days later.



P.M.	My statement is justified.

	Be prepd. for criticism why were these unsuitable aircraft so exposed

		to attack etc.,  Doesn’t look v. good.



de L.	2 Lincolns:  breach of discipline – shd. have gone back when out of

		radar contact.  Fastest &amp; largest bomber we have.

	Normal training flight – covers practice by crews as well as radar tests.

	Prepared to answer those criticisms.		[Enter  A.E.



A.E.	R. invitn. to conference.  K. says we shd. accept.

	Techn. diffy:  R. may try to narrow present rights.



de L.	In principle I’m ready to go into the conference.



A.E.	So am I.  Want dipl. repve. there as well as RAF experts.



de L.	Saceur has issued proposals for handling air infringemts.  Need close

		understandg. with U.S.  F.O. and Air Miny to confer.

					[Exit  de L.





	2.	Judges’ Salaries.	[Enter  B-H., Att.Gen.



R.A.B.	Opposn. in Tory Party must be heeded.  Little bitterness.  But they are

		on the point re Judges’ duty to interpret income tax law.

	Labour – strong feeling bound up with c/living. &amp; M.P.’s salary.

	Not v. good for Judges to have this controversy.

	May have to consider another method e.g. gross salary &amp; travel

		allowce.  WD give £850 or £900 benefit.  Indicated figures.



P.M.	What of P.M.’s first £4.000?



H.C.	Equivalent to £120.000 gross.



R.A.B.	P.M. &amp; Speaker (not announced) are unique in this.



P.M.	No advantage in hiding Speaker’s posn.



R.A.B.	Diffy. of defendg. original Bill.  Money resolution (tho’ it cd. be

		p’poned until after Easter) wd. have to be revised.  Speaker

		might say it was a difft Bill.  May be better to w’draw this

		Bill because repns. re method &amp; put in another after Easter.



M.F.	Heard no a/c of 1922 Cttee. mtg. save that in D.T.



B.H.	That was accurate.



M.F.	Then, if we don’t alter Bill, we risk defeat.  Better to alter Bill.



P.M.	In 1922 Cttee. 14 spoke against.



B.H.	Full mtg:  80/90 remained throughout &amp; supported demand for

		w’drawal of Bill.  Not enough support for this method of

		tax-free allowance.  Fear of extension to other people.  Fear

		it will provoke other wage applns. is secondary.  Genl. admn.

		tht. remuneration be improved – but no agreemt. on method

		(salary or allowance).



A.E.	Must stand to general policy.  Not shocked by high gross figure –

		£10.000.



B.H.	Good deal of opposition to that method also.



P.M.	Not surprised.



Ch.	If that method chosen, and tax is reduced, advantage will be v. great.



R.A.B.	My memo. of 14/10 to Cab. included all the arguments now 

		advanced v. it.



P.M.	Serious to retreat now.  I cd. influence Tories in debate.  Bound in

		honour to improve remunn. : method is a matter for discussion,

		when Fin. Resoln. comes to H/C. on report.  We can’t run away

		from propn. tht. Judges shd. have £1.000 more in real money.

	Let us debate Bill on that basis on Thursday.  Interval before Resoln.		comes up on report : during that we can consider views re

		method.



B-H.	Won’t get 2nd. Rdg. of Resoln. unless you say v. clearly tht. method

		will be altered.



M-F.	Consider means of avoiding loss of confidence.

	Shd. P.M. see 1922 Cttee. before debate?

	V. serious if Govt. had to w’draw after debate.



P.M.	Must also avoid humiliation of admittg. mistake.



H.M.	V. awkward if we can’t alter Bill by amendmt. &amp; have to produce a

		difft. Bill.

                    x/	Can’t we get first discussion on basis of resoln. vice 2nd. Rdg. of this

		Bill.



P.M.	Awkward.  But no slur on us.



R.A.B.	We need more time to get Tory Party right on this.  P’pone until after

		Easter.  Get time to negotiate a settlement.



P.M.	Don’t like looking irresolute.



O.L.	Can’t do it on allowances.  Choice is between our plan &amp; high gross

		salaries.



Sw.	Support x/.  Then negotiate with Party.

		Why not take on Thursday a motion advocatg. increased 

		remuneration for Judges.



B-H.	Mistake to p’pone discussion.  Take it on 2nd. Rdg. &amp; adjourn it if new

		Bill wd. be needed:  or take it on a resolution.



P.M.	Consider if new Bill is necessary.  If so, do it on a resoln.



H.C.               |	Prefer to take it on 2nd. Rdg. – wh. is a decln. of principle in favour

                    y |		of improved remuneration.  But defer takg. Money Resoln.

                       |		If amendmt. of that causes Spkr. to say a new Bill is needed,

                       |		that’s his responsibility, not ours.



R.A.B.	Will mean spending much more Parly. time on Bill.



	*P.M.	Tactics as at y/.  Gives time for negotiation.



R.A.B.	I know tht. enough members of Fin. Cttee. will oppose present method

		to prevent us getting this accepted.

					[Exit Ll.G.

	|*H.C.	Meet 1922 Cttee. m’while.

	|

	|    P.M.  Not unless I can offer to compromise on method.

	|

	|*B.H.	P.M. &amp; R.A.B. shd. see Executive of  1922 Cttee. on Mon. 

			&amp; leave it to them to communicate to Cttee.



R.A.B.	If we pledge ourselves to £1.000 and have to choose a difft. method

		we may be in v. big figures.  We may have to come down a 

		little on net figure.



P.M.	Not disposed to go below £1.000 in real money.     [Exit  Att.G., B-H.



	





	3.	Farm Price Review.



T.D.	Completed on basis of 17/3 Cab. Conclns.

	Farmers accept as settlemt. with reservns. on eggs &amp; milk.  We shall

		have their support in prodn. drive.

	Ask authy. to present Wh. Paper to-day.



J.S.	A good result.			[Exit  T.D.





	4.	Kenya.



Al.	2 Battns. leavg. by air 30/3.  Stage thro’ Khartoum.  Will arrive

		7/4 in Kenya.  Personal weapons &amp; kit:  no transport.



P.M.	If E. make trouble m’while, we cd. stop them at Fayid or Khartoum

		in terrorem.  Kenya cd. wait for a bit.  Keep this as a 

		manoeuvre in reserve.



Al.	They cd. bivouac – for a time.



P.M.	M’while no change in p’mme.  M/D. to be ready (w’out any commn

		to Sudan) for a change of plan.

	Disturbed at Mrs. Braddock’s disclosures re treatment of 4 men in

		Lanc. Fusiliers.



O.L.	Await report:  may not be well-founded.	[Exit  Sim., O.L., J.S.





	5.	Commercial Policy.



R.A.B.	Further liberalisation proposals.  Trade &amp; tourism.  Announce in 

		Paris and in H/C (by B/T) on Monday p.m.



P.M.	Diffce. betwn. £40 &amp; £50?  RA



A.E.	Object:  to prevent others from raising import restns v. us.

	Tourist.  If we go to £50, Scandinavia will ask for higher sum

		under an old agreement.

	Support £40.  That will satisfy France.



Ch.	Press for countervailg. increase in their purchase of our exports –

		otherwise we shall go back to deficit in E.P.U.



H.M.	Plea for tiles to be on liberalised list.

		Agreed:  Tourism at £40.  Rest approved.



R.A.B.	U.S. &amp; Canada will support our line on gen. ques.





	6.	Sudan.



A.E.	N.’s signature with Sud. Pol. Parties upset Br. offls. &amp; Khartoum.

		As result, they are hurt – and lying back.  “You get on with it.”		That won’t do.

	The Parties are ashamed of themselves.

	Want M/State to stiffen up both sides.

	N. has re-acted v. courteously to this Mission.





	7.	Flood Damage.



M.F.	Oppn. motion, Mon.  We can accept it.
