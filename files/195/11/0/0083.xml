C.C. 81(53).				29th December, 1953.



	1.	Egypt.		[Enter  B-C., B-H.



P.M.	Don’t like giving this £15 M. immediately after urging Eisenh. to

		w’hold U.S. economic aid.  Read extract from his message.



A.E.	He cdn’t say this was on a par with aid.  It is their money – we owe it.

		Awkward :  but clearly a different class of thing.



P.M.	“Our” balances (viz. Egypt’s) shd. be a card in our negotns.



R.A.B.	Sorry to have to raise it now.  But under the Agreemt. this is the

		time of year.  Agreemt. favours us because it restricts rate of

		w’drawal £180M. is total.

	No room for argument re the £5M.  Condns. are fulfilled :  &amp; we must 

		pay it unless we break internatl. agreemt. – with what effect on 

		our credit.  That must be paid on 1/1.

	As to remaing. £10M., no date is specified.  In ’52 we told B/E. to

		hedge if asked to pay :  &amp; we didn’t pay it until Apl.  But our

		relns. then were much stormier.  I wd. sooner pay it on 1/1:

		but if Cab. prefers we can delay it as in ’52.



P.M.	If hostilities or the like occur, we cd. cancel the whole £160 or so.



R.A.B.	Tho’ some of it results fr. current trading.



P.M.	If we break off relns., we can pinch it.  I shd. like them to know

		m’while in terrorem.



R.A.B.	Transaction is betwn. central Banks.  Ordinarily wd. not involve any

		publicity – unless interested politicians talked about it.



A.E.	How much harm to credit in delaying the £10 M?



R.A.B.	Dangers in other M/E. States e.g. Kuwait.



P.M.	See tht. there must be a breach betwn. us before we cd. lay hands

		on their balances.

	I favour bringing the E. issue to a head.  If they accept our terms we

		must take the agreemt.  But if they go on dawdling we shd. give

		notice tht. after prescribed time our offer lapses &amp; we go about

		re-deploymt. in our own way.



A.E.	Wd. be reasonably well received by Govt. supporters in H/C.

	But in M/E. am not sure tht. it wd. be to our advantage.

		We shd. weigh the advantages v. carefully.



P.M.	Gt. advantage if we kept initiative &amp; went of our own accord.



A.E.	But you go then, w’out any right to return – no Treaty &amp; no 

		safeguards for Canal.

			Shall I submit memo. summarising pros &amp; cons

			for each course?



P.M.	Must have an early Cabinet on this.



Al.	Recommend skinning the base, then w’drawing as mil. opn. – w’out

		prior running down of nos.



P.M.	Wdn’t avoid serious loss of prestige.



P.M.	Keep back the £10 M. m’while, as in 1952.



R.A.B.	Will be awkward to delay for more than a week or so.





	2.	Overseas Information Services.



M.F.	Impressed by arguments for expansion :  but because need for 

		economy recommend tht. any expansion be p’poned for a year. 

		No increase in total exp’re in 1954.



P.M.	V. wise recommn.

                   x/	Enforce Drogheda cuts &amp; defer the expansions.



A.E.	Expressed dissent.



M.F.	We shall be pressed to publish Rpt. &amp; our decns. on it.  Wd. be awkw.

		to have to admit x/ as a policy.

	Better to make a new plan w’in the 1953 ceiling.



Sw.	Accept M-F.’s proposal.  But i) on further work of Cttee., hope 

		Ministers will concentrate on doing necessary things properly.

			                              ii) U.N.E.S.C.O. - £373.000 :  £42.000

		more than last year.  Can’t we save that.



A.E.	Confusion in Services since war – because of successive reductions.

		Total redn. just under £2 M.

	Cd. decide we don’t want these Services.  If we don’t, we must make

		them adequate.  B’castg., representg. main part of exp’re, is v.

		important.  Cost = 2 bombers.

	18 mos. ago we set up Drogheda Cttee.  Good omen, hand-picked:

		not enthusiasts for propaganda.  They spent 9 months workg. on

		this &amp; produced a proper plan.  First we have had.  Want to see

		it put into opn.  Ready to spread it over 5 yrs. vice 3. :  even then

		exp’re wd. be less than in ’47.

	We must go on with this :  or close down on it, as France.

	This is part of cold war.



	This year:  some automatic increases.  Apart fr. those only about

		£100.000 more.



P.M.	Have we become more influential by reason of this exp’re.



O.L.	W.F.T.U. activities in Br. Colonies – subversion.  Can’t counter them

		w’out expenditure.  False economy to cut down on it.



M.F.	We propose they stand at £10 M. this year.



A.E.	Least I cd. justify to Parlt. is acceptce. of Rpt.



H.C.	We were v. critical in Opposn. esp. of Br. Council.



M.F.	Increase in ’54 total nearly £1 M.  £570.000 in addn. to the automatic

		(salary etc.,) increases.



Sal.	Cut made in 1952 (spring) was justified by the then economic crisis.		Shd. be sorry to cut back again now.



P.M.	Don’t believe in these things.  We haven’t benefited.

	Doubtless they do some good.  But swollen staffs etc., 

		self-justification.  And what benefit?



W.	B.B.C. = £4½ M.  Br. Council £2½ M.  Out of total of £10 M.



W.M.	Have read Rpt., &amp; discussed with D.

	This is not useless exp’re.  But we are not in a posn. to increase exp’re

		now.  Anymore than we can increase expre on defence or

		social services.

	Some useful work cd. be done for £10 M., if ideal = £12½ M.

	Don’t accept all D.’s recommns.



O.L.	Are we to operate under an overall “ceiling”.

		My preference wd. be for abandoning that &amp; allowg. each Dpt.

		to make its case.



M.F.	We favour increased flexibility. – see report.



W.M.	Room for more flexibility :  but not for overall expansn. this year.



R.A.B.	Haven’t the money.  Can’t get savings elsewhere.

	Suggest each Dpt. (separately) shd. keep w’in last year’s total.

	Was a pity the D. Cttee’s. t. of r. made no refce. to economy.



O.L.	Prefer overall ceiling – leaves scope to redeploy betwn. Dpts.



Sw.	E.g. – get some more off Br. Council to spend on more vital things.





P.M.	V. agonising economies made by Services.  R.N. are quivering with

		unhappiness.  Surely propaganda can’t be regarded as immune.

		H/C. will draw damaging comparison.



W.M.	Drogheda :  para. 50 :  second alternative.

			Agreed :   resume discussion at later mtg.

					     [Exit  B-C.



	3.	Valuation for Rating.



H.M.	Natl. re-valn. for rating.  1929 :  a week before poll.  1937 :  had to be

		p’poned.  For unpopularity.  Reason :  any re-valuation will

		involve large increase in assessmt.  Shops &amp; offices shd. rise

		by 300/400% :  houses shd. double.  In theory, poundage shd.

		be reduced correspondingly :  but in practice it isn’t.

	L.a.’s have usually cheated in valuation :  in order to benefit by

		block grants.  Must therefore have central valuation.

	Must not bring it into effect before next Election.

	Awkward to p’pone: – diffy. of finding avowable reasons.

		But  i)   natd. industries :  new scheme is needed.

		        ii)  previously assessmts, publd. in Nov., &amp; poundage in

			    followg. April.

	Cd. get them issued simultaneously by provn. in legn. next Session, thus		providing excuse to p’pone until Apl. ’56. 

	Wd also cost £1 M. to keep staff idly about.



R.A.B.	Agree with method.  But how explain delay? No decn. to-day.  Shd.

 	have a memo.  



H.C.	No room for legn this Session.





	4.	Housing :  Rents Bill.



H.M.	Amendmts. are so numerous tht. its obvious Opposn. intend to obstruct.

		Seems likely we shall have to use guillotine.

		Shall try, at first, w’out it.





	5.	Industrial Disputes.



W.M.	We chose lesser of 2 evils.  But it was victory for extremists.

	Engineering – sitn. is acute.  Arbitn. will be rejected by T.U.’s.

		Conciliation is out because employers won’t make any offer.

		Only possibility therefore is Ct. of Enquiry.  Neither side wants

		it :  but moderate T.U. leaders &amp; some employers wd. like it.

	They will ask me to pull c’nuts out of fire when they are too hot.

	I think therefore I shall have to appoint Ct./Enquiry after seeing

		the 2 sides to-morrow.  A v. strong one.  

		It mght cause p’ponemt. of ban on over-time etc.   

		It   ..        ..       dissension in Confedn. – some mght fall away.  

		A Ct. Appeal Judge wd. be valuable.



				[Enter  L.O.’s &amp; D.E.

	6.	Crichel Down.



T.D.	Two issues  i)   Privilege.

			  ii)  Policy re previous owners’ “rights”.

	Suggest H.A. Cttee. shd. look at (ii) in first instance.



W.	Summarised earlier history.

	Trouble we now face won’t arise on policy but on procedure

		followed in this case.  Criticism will be directed, not v. policy,

		but v. its administration.  Martin’s request to apply for tenancy

		was in fact ignored.



T.D.	Only a part was Martin’s interest.  And I decided tht. the land shd. be 

		farmed as a unit.  I didn’t want to farm it myself.  I decided

		Crown Lands shd. take over &amp; find a tenant.  Avoided spending

		Exchequer money on the bldgs.

	After that, local talk about corruptn.  I then decided i) to have enquiry

		on procedure and ii) to discuss policy with colleagues.

	No corruptn. :  but muddled adminn.



M.F.	Enquiry.

	First, doubt wtr. it shd. go fwd.  Satisfied tht. it wd. be worse to try

		to stifle it once it has bn. offered.  View of my Sub-Cttee. tht.

		it shd. go fwd.

	Second, what documents shd. be disclosed to Martin.  He has already

		recd. several 100 letters betwn Govt. agencies.  Shd. he also have 

		Dpl. minutes &amp; briefs?  My view is tht. we shd. decline to

		disclose minutes etc., - tho’ we mght. have to consider firm 

		request for them fr. Clark.  When ques. of corruptn. raised, have

		to be generous – cf. Lynskey Tribunal.

	Not have adjournment until Apl.  Suggest Cttee., plus Ld. Chanc., shd.

		consider this further.



P.M.	Must go thro’ with it.  Hushing it up wd. damage Govt. credit.

	Some demarcation can be drawn betwn. officials’ minutes to Minister

		&amp; letters – tho’, if there were suggns. of corruptn., even former

		might have to be disclosed.



Sim.	T. of r. are dangerously wide.  Doubt if we can w’hold anything if 

		Clark presses for it.

	Stress gravity of issues.



Att.G.	Clark has said he shd. see everything.



P.M.	Memo. for Cabinet on principles to be applied re 

		disclosure.

P.M.	On policy, surely this Govt. shd. seek to return land to 

			private owners.



Sal.	Can’t have absolute rule tht. land shd. in all circs. be returned to

		original owner.  But surely we cd. try to consult their interests.

		Present policy seems to be contrary.

				[Exit  D.E. and L.O.’s.



	7.	Japan.



R.A.B.	Authority to admit £3.35 M. into U.K. of J. goods.

	No credit :  but continue swaps for 3 mos.



P.T.	Accept this – tho’ it means admittg various J. goods wh. haven’t

		come here since war.  £2 M. of grey cloth for re-export :  can

		cope with that:  but £1 m. or more of miscell. goods.

		About 33% of pre-war imports of those commodities.

	There will be trouble, but not unmanageable trouble.



			Approved.





	8.	British Somaliland.



A.E.	O.L. will make this further attempt to settle w’out ceding territory.

	Try it :  but it may not come off.
