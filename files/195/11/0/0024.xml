C.C. 16(53)							3rd March, 1953



		1.	Royal Title.					[Enter B.H., L.B.



M.F.	May I use this in debate this p.m.?



P.M.	Yes.  Bring out the fact tht. clash in numerals has recurred before, w’out any point being taken.



J.S.	Omit [  ].  There were complaints re Edw. VII and VIII : and P.Q.’s were answered.



P.M.	Say : never previously became an issue.(?)  Or, better, refer to answer.

	C.85 is a diff. theme.  Don’t try to ride 2 horses.  Prefer to rely on arguments C.83.  Take the line tht. we are following the precedent of 1901 (Ed. VIII).



J.S.	Elliot may make the statement in C.85.



P.M.	It cd. be described as interesting : mght be considered before it arises.

	Things have worked out that way, happily.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.		

						[Exit B.H.

						[Enter P.M.G &amp; Maudling

		3.	Television.



P.M.	Strong feeling in Party.

	Tempy. television facilities cd. be provided by B.B.C. before Coronation, at P’smouth, Plymouth &amp; Aberdeen.



P.M.G.	Mock-up for Coronation mght cost betwn. £15-30.000 for each.



P.M.	Brighton is served by booster &amp; gives gt. satisfn.  I think this shd. be done because of public feeling.



P.M.G.	Limited &amp; unreliable service.  WD. cover not more than 5, prs 3 (?) miles.  WD. only cover ½ the town.  Dissatisftn. v. likely.  No stand-by equipment.  People will have bought their sets to v. little purpose.

	Unreliable because subject to atmospheric interference.  They mght. not see the Coronation on the day.

	Can’t continue this service afterwards.  Shd. have to go ahead with the 5 permanent transmitters, wh. R.A.B. opposes.



P.M.	Now too late to lay on anything satisfy.  And if we offered to provide, people wd. buy sets and be dissatisfied.



							[Exit P.M.G.

					[Enter J.P.L.T &amp; C.N.S., S.H., G.H.

		4.	East.West Trade.



L-B.	Two major concessions : para.19(a) and (b).  These are our most vulnerable points.  Shd. help A.E.



Sw.	Suggd. tht. U.S. and U.K. shd. make joint approach on bunkers.  We are more likely to get Doms. to co-operate if we handle it alone.



L-B.	Agree.

	Storing.  Can’t control ship’s chandlers all over world.

	H.K. Register.  Better keep them under our control.



J.T.	Against giving public warning v. Straits.



P.M.	What if Nationalists try to interfere.



S.Ll.	Want to say m’while tht. owners will be discouraged.



O.L.	Wd. need legn. in Singapore.



S.Ll.	Bunkering : Plan to refuse bunkers if we know tht. ship is carrying strategic goods.



M.F.	Cab. shd. be aware tht. this means keeping D.R.46, wh. M/T. were ready to discontinue.  There may be trouble in December.



            *	Have L.O.’s bn. asked wthr D.R. can be used in these circumstances?



P.M.	They should be.



S.Ll.	Hong Kong ships?  



L.B. 	D.R.46 will give us chance to control their carriage of strategic goods.



		S.H. and L.B. with G.Ll. and Admy. to concert draft

		telegram to A.E.



P.M.	Admy. shd. give at least friendly advice to shipping cos. re Straits.



						[Exit L.B., J.T., C.N.S., G.Ll.

		           		-				[Exit S.Ll.

								[Enter T.D., Ll.G.



		8.	Farm Price Review.



T.D.	…. my compromise is 5/8d. – wh. can be defended as dividing betwn. producer and consumer the advantage of increased farm efficiency.

	Diffce. means only 6 wks. of extra ½d. p.g. to consumer.  But £3M. to farmers wh. wd. bear hardly on small &amp; less efficient producer.

	Farmers will ask for 2d. p.g.



H.G.	Even ¼d. is a concession.  Milk is not unprofitable now : average net profit is 9½d. p.g. or 33⅓%.  If you make it more profitable, you induce more prodn. by high-cost producers : &amp; we can’t do with more high-cost milk.  Consumptn. has dropped by 2%.



W.M.	Must be careful of food prices.  ½d. pint for 9 wks. wd. be just under ½ point.  Milk prodn. is profitable now : unjustifiable to make it more so.



Sw.	Higher price is to base policy on worst farmer &amp; worst cow.



T.D.	No : it’s geographical : eg. N.I.

	Average profit doesn’t show posn. of small farmer.  £650 p.a. on 100 acre farm : &amp; milk wage wd. be £500.



Ch.	Shd. encourage beef at expense of milk.



M.F.	Accept economic arguments. But small farmer depends on milk cheque.



H.C.	Agree.  This is crisis year because of decontrol.  Must m’tain confidence.  ¼d. wd not be enough.



B.C.	Increased price will stimulate demand for feed – &amp; worsen b/p.

	We support M/F. view.



T.D.	Not much danger of that on milk.  Pigs mainly, &amp; we are checking that.



P.T.	£90 m. subsidy on milk now.  Can’t do more.  Nor put more on price.

	Support M/F.



H.G.	Subsidy has increased by £10M. this year because of increased production.



P.M.	Begin with ¼d. &amp; don’t go higher w’out reference to Cabinet.



T.D.	If you impose a ¼d. settlemt., you will lose confidence &amp; get pol. trouble.  As Labour did by under recompmt. on milk in ’50.



J.S.	Mainly a pol. problem because of anxiety of farmers.



H.M.	Will there be an agreemt.?  If a settlement is imposed, we cd. do what we thght right.



T.D.	No agreement with milk at less than 5/8d.



P.M.	Diff. to decide.

	Advice from another Cttee.  O.L., M.F., Ch.
