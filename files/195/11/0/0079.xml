C.C. 74(53).				1st December, 1953.



	1.	Uganda.		[Enter  B-H., D.S.



P.M.	How does this stand.



O.L.	In Govr.’s interview K. refused each of the 3 assurances sought.

		He has now arrived in U.K.



P.M.	If he repents, cd. you forgive?  Keep that in reserve.



O.L.	My reference to E. African Fedn. was v. long-term.  I have since 

		assured him tht. we have no immedte. intentn. of seeking such

		a combination.  That is not an issue in his removal fr. power.



P.M.	May be adjournment.



B.H.	Opposn. agree tht. it shd. not be to-day.  They favour to-morrow.  Shd.

		we offer to give time then.  C.R.A. wd. accept that.



J.S.	House will want to know wtr K. was warned early enough tht. he wd.

		be deposed if he didn’t give assurances.



O.L.	HC gave clear indicn. of serious consequences.  If he had bn. more 

		explicit K. wd. have disappeared.



P.M.	How long was he given to consider his posn. at last interview.



O.L.	From Friday to Mon. – on basis of “v. serious consequences”.

	And on Mon. early in interview it was made clear tht., if assurances

		were not given, HMG. wd. be entitled to w’draw recognition.

		This was before final processes were put in motion.

	If K. now makes reversal of his posn., that will be a new situation.

                     x|	Tho’ may be a choice betwn. K. &amp; Govr.



P.M.	Situation can be reviewed by Cab. to-morrow.

		Don’t exclude x/ until to-morrow.





	2.	Sudan.



A.E.	Govr. refers to possibility of UMMA P.M. Can’t think why?  Assumes 

	independents may still adhere to UMMA.  Prob political naiveté.  







	3.	Persia.



A.E.	Persians now proposing a jumble of what we suggd.  Better than 

		anything we have had so far.  Will be commended to Shah.

		They may therefore accept exchange of Ambassadors.

	Saw Hoover y’day.  Big U.S. Cos. won’t go into this w’out invitn.

		of A.I.O.C.  But a number of small cos. are now touting in

		Tehran – headed by Alton Jones – for sale of oil.  Warned

		U.S. Amb. of serious consequences on Anglo-U.S. relns. if 

		U.S. Cos. began selling stolen oil.

	I favour consortium with 50% B. interest.  But no share to U.S.

		pirate cos.  Depends (Hoover agrees) on A.I.O.C. invitn.

		A.I.O.C. wd. be selling agency for all.  Int. Bank mght come

		in, as nominally i/c. – mght make it more acceptable to P.

	Shd. be ready to put a plan fwd, as soon as dipl. relns. restored.

	If we get one, U.S. will then exclude pirate cos.



			                                                 [Enter  3 Serv. Min, O.P.



	4.	Officers’ Retired Pay.               P.Q.’s To-day.  i) Langford-Holt.  					ii) Lipton.



R.A.B.	Looking ahead, sitn.  in neither House will be easy.  Impressed by

		feeling tht. Ty. are not fair in their attitude.  Considerg. an

		enquiry to establish facts – and remove suggn. of breach of

		faith.

	Wdn’t announce that in reply to Lipton, to-day.  WD. prefer to deal 

	with it in reply to a Tory later.



P.M.	P.Q. by Langford-Holt.



B.H.	Say “matter is before Sel. Cttee. of this House”.



RAB.	Wd. prefer to p’pone decision on enquiry pro. tem.



A.E.	We argued tht. we cdn’t draw a line.  This implies we can.

		Suppose enquiry says this shd. be done, where is your line?



RAB.	Complaint is tht. these offrs. have bn. singled out for specially

		unfair-treatmt.  Enquiry must show tht. they haven’t been.



P.M.	Isn’t it rash to say we haven’t changed our policy, only ques is 

		“have we cheated?”  Will weaken yr. general posn.



R.A.B.	No need to promise it to-day.  Say to Lipton only : “Sel. Cttee. wd. not

		be appropte. for this purpose.”

	But, unless we do something, believe we shall be beaten on Private

		Members’ Motion on Dec. 11th.



Sim.	Don’t like idea of Govt. submittg. to another tribunal ques wtr they

		have bn. guilty of breach of faith.  Offering to commit

		ourselves for trial.



R.A.B.	I am certain we are not guilty : hence I welcome enquiry.



P.M.	I wd. sooner do it than submit my good faith to indep. enquiry.

	Debate it in H/C.



R.A.B.	And on Pr. Member Motion we shall be beaten.



A.E.	Wd. destroy our credit to give way now.



P.M.	Or to admit tht. we weren’t sure we were playing fair.

	But v. serious sitn. if we were defeated, on 11/12.



B.H.	I believe we shall be defeated:  even if we issued a 3 line whip

		which we cdn’t do on a Friday.



R.A.B.	It’s not our good faith which we may impugn by an enquiry.

		Even exclusion of these officers fr. pensions increases

		(hardship) was in 1944.



P.M.	But we endorsed it.  It wd. be enquiry into wtr our latest decision

		is fair.



W.M.	Cd. you devise some other form of enquiry, not involving good

		faith.



P.M.	I will reply to Lipton :  “HMG. are not prepared to

		adopt this proposal.”

		I wd. not favour enquiry à la R.A.B.

		Stand firm.  Now why can’t we win on 11/12.

	We cd. say – we will accept decn. of H/C., .....



B.H.	To put Whips on, on a Friday, wd. enrage H/C.  Only those 

		interested will come.  But campaign wouldn’t die.



P.M.	Face possibility that it will be carried, but make it clear that we shall

		not allow it to alter our policy.



M-F.	Govt. spokesmen cd. make it clear tht. in our view there is no breach

		of faith.  Believe opinion in country is coming round to our view.

	Only course is to stand by our decision.



RAB.	I must speak.



O.P.	I have had adverse votes to face.  Better to put Parly. Secy. up on such

		occasions.  We weren’t actually beaten :  but we faced defeat

		&amp; shdn’t have changed policy if we had been.



H.C.	It is regarded as major issue :  believe R.A.B. wd. have to speak.

	But agree tht. it is only a Friday.  It wdn’t be technically a Govt.

		defeat.  But it wd. keep the campaign alive.

		WD. need to make it clear to Press in advance tht. it wdn’t be

		regarded as a Govt. defeat.



P.M.	Disposed to favour small vote &amp; a Junior Minister.



F.H.	Doubt if there need be a Divn. at all.



J.S.	Believe it will be carried : may be no divn.



H.M.	Let Fin. Secy. go – &amp; say “of course we will reconsider”.  Then no

		division will follow.



P.M.	Speech by RAB wd. raise issue to one of 1st. rate

		importance.  Let Fin. Secy. handle it, &amp; play it all down :

		or Parly. Secy. M/Defence.



H.M.	And let that be known in advance &amp; 2 preceding Motions

		prs. won’t be w’drawn.



P.M.	If we decide afterwds. tht. effect is v. serious, we mght

		have to make it a vote of confidence &amp; let RAB &amp; all

		make a big stand.



R.A.B.	Fin. Secy. cd. say we don’t accept it now, but will be 

		ready to reconsider when circs. change.



A.E.	Might consider an amentmt. (but regrets tht. fin. circs. make

		it imposs. at present) – wh. wd. divide the House.

					[Exit  O.P., BH.



	5.	The New Rifle.



R.A.B.	Content, subject to reservations indicated to M/D.



H.C.	Shd tell A., N.Z., S. Africa.



A.H.	As soon as we have negotiated manuf. rights.



D.S.	No public statement until those rights secured – wdn’t apply to

		announcemt. re bullet.



A.H.	N.A.T.O. announcemt. on bullet wd. in any event come first.

					[Exit  A.H., D.S.



	6.	Fog.



M.F.	As in memo.
