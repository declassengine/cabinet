C.C. 45(53).				23rd July, 1953.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  B.H., S.Ll.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Defence : N.A.T.O. &amp; related matters : on Wedy.  Govt.

		spokesmen : ?L.P.S. &amp; Birch.

		To be settled afterwds.

	Adjournment – until 20/10.





	2.	Cabinet Meetings in August.



	Subject to P.M.’s approval – provisional dates 10/8 at 3 p.m.   }

				25/8 at ll a.m.   }

		Other mtgs. to deal with urgent business, if needed.

	Cab. Cttees. not to meet in August.





	3.	Egypt.



S.	Advised tht. 10 yrs dead is next best to our formula.

		World posn. 10 yrs’ ahead can’t be foreseen.

		Provn. in agreemt. to consult before 10 yrs. are up.

		If U.S. really understand importce. of base, they will give us more

		support then than now – unless world sitn. is entirely changed.

		P.M. wd. be content with 10 yrs. duration.

	Try therefore for original plan:  be ready to accept 10 yrs. – but ask R.

		to refer back before accepting that.



O.L.	Not v. happy.  But reserve further comments until it is referred.



Al.	W’in 10 yrs. we can get on better terms with E., surely.  I wd. accept

		that.



Sw.	If we are ready to accept 10, better to let R. know at once.



L.	Want more than 10 yrs. for Canal.  Tho’ separate talks on that.  And

		U.S. are more helpful on that.



O.L.	Some provision for re-negotiation in last 3 years.  Or continue fr. year

		to year.



S.	If that means we stay in absence of agreemt. it’s same as our formula

		&amp; E. won’t accept it.

	If it means only consultn., we can get that in.

		Agreed : Accept 10 yrs. &amp; provn. tht. both parties shall then

			      consult regarding means of preservg. future security

			      of base.     Tell R. now.      Also about Canal negotns.



	4.	Korea.



S.	Warning statement agreed in ’52 by all 16 nations concerned.  As we

		were incldg. adequate phrase in communiqué, I suggd. in W’ton

		that this wd. be enough w’out the declaration.  The others wdn’t 

		agree.  But D. seemed shaky on publn.  He has now suggd. tht. 

		this decln. be buried in documentation handed in to U.N.

	Alternative : communicate it to Ch. Govt. – and then allow it to come

		out later.

	Don’t like this.  Ready to tell D. personally tht., while we won’t run

		out on our agreemt., I think it wd. be a mistake to publish it and

		wd. be upsetting to Anglo-U.S. relations.



R.A.B.	Most unfortunate moment because S. Rhee.

	Wd. cause real anger in H/Commons.

	Cdn’t we claim tht. circs. have changed and we are no longer 

		bound to our pledge.



			Agreed :  S. to prepare such a telegram (official) &amp; show

			                it to R.A.B.





	5.	Libya:  Treaty.



S.	Authy. to sign before 31/7 if L. agree.

	Do Cab. want to see the text.



R.A.B.	Advanced £¼M. above figure mentioned to Cabinet.



			Agreed : Authority given to sign.

			               Text to be circulated post eventum.





	6.	Germany.   Four-Power Meeting.



S.	Can’t defend my action in W’ton w’out disclosing tht. U.S. &amp; Fr.

		wdn’t accept 4 Power Mtg. at P.M. level w’out agenda.

	Want to tell the story frankly.  Limiting it to “unwilling at this stage”.



RAB.	I wd. have liked to take that line.  F.O. advised against it.

		But, as you were at W’ton, you can be free to make the case as

		you will.



S.Ll.	Especially as it has now turned into a personal attack on S.

		And F.O. have now changed their mind – because attack has

		now bn. made &amp; must be answered.



R.A.B.	P.M. wd. have liked me to take this line.

	I want it said – to turn off attempts to divide P.M. from Tory Party.



			                                    [Enter T.D., A.L.B., Marples, G.Ll.

	7.	Coal.

 

	1)	General.

L.	Need:  more briquetting.  Diffy : to find binder other than pitch.  Hope

		of that.  Rlways. are working at this.  But 18/24 mos before any

		big results can be expected fr. this.

	Electricity take 35 m. tons of nothg. but small coal.  Give them more 

		investment so they can burn even more.

	Using more of large coal in domestic market wd. mean loss of 

		exports – for cdn’t export small unless pickled in with large.

	2)  Open-cast.   Threatened by delay in getting sites.  No desire to 

		use specially rich agric. land : but can’t afford to drop p’mme 

		below 10 m.



R.A.B.	Action : i)     Publicity to convert h’holders to use.

		     ii)    More pressure on rlways. to use small coal.

		     iii)   Recruit more foreign mining engineers : Increase

		                     investm’t.

		     iv)    Incentive schemes relatg. bonus to attendance.

		     v)     More Swiss machinery.



S.	Mechanisation means more small coal.  Was it worth while?  Shd. we

		go on?



P.T.	Might be better to get smaller total &amp; more large coal.  Shdn’t this be

		considered?



L.	Cdn’t ask miners now to cut by hand.  Re-actionary.  Must accept 

		mechanisation and its consequences.



Ch.	Need to insist on more economy in use.  E.g. domestic space heating :		subsidy to stoves and tax on coal.  Restrict use of electricity for

		space heating.  Technical w. party to go into this.



W.	Is it easier to get miners to work harder or to get consumers to alter

		all their habits.

	Mght have done good to hold enquiry into N.C.B.



O.L.	Can’t turn our backs on mechanisation.  Mass-produced articles are

		never as good as hand-produced.  But this is industrial trend wh.

		we can’t reverse.  Must therefore tackle consumer habits etc.,



L.	O.m.s. is falling because scams are narrowing p’essively.



P.T.	We export locos. wh. can run on coffee (Brazil).  Why can’t we use 

		them at home?



L.	We have 20,000 in use.  Must wait for new ones before change in 

		design.

W.	When Labour turned rlways fr. coal to oil, it didn’t take long to

		convert.



L.	That was easier – tho’ not always successful.



A.L.B.	For shunting Br. Rlways. are going over to diesel.		[Exit  B.H.

		Also for high passenger density lines.

		But elsewhere thght uneconomic.

	Electrification – saves 100,000 t. of coal for £30M. investment.

	We cd. force them to use briquettes if they were available cheap.



R.A.B.	Policy : Directives.



	i)	Householders.  Ready to consider means other than  -

		tax relief to encourage x/ efficient appliances.

		Differential charges for large &amp; small coal – wider differentials.

	ii)	Accept L.’s line &amp; increased briquetting with 

		Swiss machinery.

	iii)	Investment.  I have refused none.  Dpts can ask

		or more.

	iv)	Foreign Mining Engineers.

	v)	Consider incentive schemes relatg. bonus to 

		attendance – further report.

	vi)	Must do somethg. more to infuse greater life into N.C.B.

		will L. offer suggns.



J.S.     	Better publicity for  x/



Ch.	Add.  Discouragement of electrical space heating.

		 Bonus for attendance.



W.	Against subsidies on principle.  Support J.S. view.  Publicity shd. be

		enough.



			Agreed:  as above.



	(2)	Opencast Programme.

R.A.B.	Must go on with this for a time.

	Can’t Ministers make a plan for doing this with least harm to 

		agriculture.



T.D.	Willing to join in consultns.

	V. discouraging.



		L. to convene Ministers for further review of policy, on basis of

			para. 4 of L.’s memo.

		L. to include this in his next interim report.



			                                      [Exit  G.Ll., T.D., Marples, A.L.B.





			                                      [Enter  PMG., de. L. &amp; B-H.

	8.	Television.



PMG.	Tel. Adv. Rpt. shows only 1 natl. network (addl.) in next 5 yrs.

	Local stations won’t work.

	Short of dropping this altogether, (d) seems now to be only 

		practicable course.  True capital wd. have to be raised on Ty.

		guarantee:  but private enterprise wd. provide its revenue.  

		WD. reduce problems of control : wd. avoid politics/religious

		controls : also choice between 70/80 applicants.  Cd. put it fwd.

		as experimental.

	A compromise, with merits.



O.L.	Para. 2(a).  Why need it be a single co?



PMG.	Because only 1 natl. network is available.



RAB.	We have to present W. Paper.  Must decide what goes into it?



W.	Pledged to some form of competitive television.

	Party in H/C. want it based on private enterprise.

	Cd. support (d) if the corpn. were financed by private enterprise, with

		no Govt. money.  Justify controlling Govt. interest, thro’ majority

		on board, because of moral importance.  Then trust them to 

		license smaller stations or to sell their own time.  In selling time

		they shd. be bound by published conditions.  Cd. carry Derby’s 

		supporters on that basis.

	Believe Party wd. accept solution on those lines.



M.F.	I wanted (b).  But see diffies.  i) for national hook-up we shd. create a

		private monopoly.  ii) if J.W.T. put up capital, we shd. be 

		accused of squeezing other agents out.

	Considered (d) therefore.  Public capital:  revenue largely fr.

		pr. enterprise.  (e) seems impossible in H/C.  Straight

		sponsoring as at (b) wd. not get past H/L.  Wd. be ready

		therefore to support (d).  Especially as it mght. be interim scheme

		only : and more air-room mght. be available later.



R.A.B.	W. Paper wd. also discuss diffies. of other solutions.



B.H.	If W. Paper is to plump for one line, it’s too early to say what Party

		will think.  We meant to allow opinion to crystallise.  Can’t

		say yet that (d) will do.

	All the alternatives shd. be stated in W. Paper.



H.C.	We don’t want to plump for any one solution.

		Cd. prs. lead in some direction when, later, we have a clearer

		view.





R.A.B.	Draft W. Paper explaining diffies. of other solutions &amp;

	       	leading up to (d). 

	Or (N. Collins) p. corpn. running transmitters &amp; cos (?)

		responsible for p’mmes.

	Consider W.’s alternative and N. Collins plan.

	x/	P.M.G. to keep in touch with Sw. Cttee. (liaison) – Amory			      		in Sw. absence.



	Reserve, for later mtg., decisions how the alternatives be weighted.



Sw.	PMG. shd. keep in touch with W. Elliott also.

	Shd. religion &amp; politics be quite excluded?



W.	No straight political or religious talks.  But same as B.B.C. –

		discussion under control.  Allow public board to be guardian 

		of that.





	9.	Post Office Staff Associations.



R.A.B.	Need statement be made before recess.



PMG.	Listowel has tabled P.Q. for Tuesday.



W.M.	1922 Cttee. seen.  Majority see merits – tho’ it’s difficult.

		I’m not in a hurry.  WD. need to look v. carefully at draft.



RAB.	Some of Party are still sore about pledges.  Don’t want a rushed

		statement before recess.



B.H.	Could face it before recess if it’s a good statement.

		The keen minority will make as much fuss in October.



de L.	AEA – wd. sooner avoid statement of principle.  It’s going quite

		well.



PMG.	EOTA propaganda is increasing.  Wd. like decision taken now.

		M/L. and I have done all we can with Party.



R.A.B.	Don’t like it on merits.  Must make it clear it’s no precedent.

		Want to reconsider draft.

		Ask L. to p’pone Question until Wedy.

			Consider draft at Tuesday’s Cabinet.

	10.	Privileges:  Internatl. Sugar Council.



Ll.G.	Privileges wh. I suggest are less than those usually extended to

LlG.	Yes.  Dom. citizenship will exempt.
