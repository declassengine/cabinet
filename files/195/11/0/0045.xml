C.C. 38 (53)					1st July, 1953



48.	    Officers’ Retired Pay.

			                                             [Enter 2 Serv. Min., B-H., S.Ll.



RAB.	As in memo.		



Al.	‘Contractual’ argument.  Restoration of cut is not inconsistent with contractual basis.



R.A.B.	Can’t do this alone.  And legn. will be requd. for some.



Al.	Will have to do something later : &amp; lose credit m’while.



M.F.	Wd. increase pressure for police widows : wd. cost around £200.000.



W.M.	Cdn’t stop at Services – repercussions inevitable.



RAB.	Strong case in equity but not in law.



De.L.	C.Service is not on exactly same (contractual) basis.  But if they were concession wd. have to extend to them.



W.	We cdn’t hold this in H/L. if it were taken to a division.



Sw.	We shd. be beaten.  Labour Peers wd. vote v. us.



Sim.	What case cd. you make to distinguish civil servants fr. officers?



O.L.	Wdn’t try:  we have no case – no answer tht. we mght have to right injustices to others.



RAB.	C. Servants – legn. and £360,000 cost.



A.H.	Politics.  Pressure in H/C. will be v. strong.  Probly. shan’t w’hold it.



B.H.	There is enough to make things v. difficult.



Sw.	We have admitted justice of this claim:  pleading only repercussions.

Having used that argument, we have weakened case for resistg.

repercussion if we now concede the first.

	This is awkward season for wage claims.  Cd. we wait until autumn.



P.T.	Yes.  Tribunals &amp; employers wd. take this as sign fr. Govt. tht. they can be easy.



O.L.	There’s never a time when it isn’t awkward for wage claims.



R.A.B.	P’pone to autumn.  Invite me to consider minimum ‘packet’ of concessions, and submit it before Recess to Cabinet.  Tho’ no announcement before autumn.

Sal.	Cd. M/D. say, if necessary, we are considering in light of debate &amp; hope to say somethg. before v. long.



R.A.B.	Let me consider then what cd. be said before Recess.



Sal.	These people suffer more than many who are making wage claims.



R.A.B.	Accept Cab. view tht. this case must be met.

Ask for chance to consider minimum packet.



H.C.	May we have a note on C.S. position.



H.M.	Line btw. adminve. and legn.



Sw.	Not much time for debate before recess.

				[Exit  3. Serv. Min.



1.	    Food Prices

					[Enter Ll.G.

	Not heard.



					[Exit Ll. G.

1.	    Regency.

51)	

Sal.	I suggest that on the doubtful point, Queen’s wishes be ascertained.



Sim.	I favour existing law – 21 vice 18.  Hope argument will be put to Queen.



			Agreed.



J.S.	Pity we shd. have to legislate in advance.

	If we must – Cl. 1. refers to “D/Cornwall”.  Will be trouble that he isn’t given also the title “Rothesay.”



R.A.B.	Let M-F. have Audience.  Bring up procedure again.



H.C.	Better do it before summer recess.



			Agreed

			                                                  [Enter P.M.G., Ll.G. Gamm.



1.	    Television.

52)	

PMG.	Shortened statement.

	Wish to show tht. our minds are not closed : and to keep way open to change our policy.  There are other ways of providing competition.

I don’t want to raise the merits of that to-day : but suggest we mght keep that possibility open.

Ch.	Welcome that suggn.  Sponsored television isn’t only means.

Don’t reject other means a priori.  Let public judge.



O.L.	Statement is too weak on commercial – suggests we have run away.



Sal.	Dissent : we must indicate now at top of p. 2.		[Exit Al. &amp; M/L.

tht. ques. is open.  Remainder is all on sponsored televn.



M-F.	We have decided – thght we were going to stand to it.

B.B.C. will inspire agitn. so long as Govt. appear undecided.

Support O.L. : unless Cab. want to waver.



RAB.	Stand on competition.  But nature of it &amp; safeguards have still to be debated.



Sw.	Case in favour of sponsored T.V. must be put out by C. Office – objective statement.



H.C.	If we are leaving posn. open, C. Office shd. keep quiet.



R.A.B.	They must wait until W. Paper is publd. before they can make their full case.



H.M.	If they put anything out at this stage, it must be balanced – with arguments on both sides.

	My hunch is that sponsored T.V. is not going to happen.  Keep that in mind.



M.F.	A no. of us are on record in Parlt. in favour of commercial T.V. We are asked : have we changed our views?  I haven’t.  What hedge is there?



RAB.	We cdn’t get it thro’ H/L.  We shd. have diffy. in H/C.  P. opinion is disturbed – and ignorant.  We only propose now to educate it, putting out the full case.



O.L.	It all turns on condns. of licence – not the ques. of principle.



R.A.B.	P’pone decn. on C. Office : propaganda until we know reaction to this statement.



Sw.	Put back first sentence blaming late Govt. for ban on B.B.C. developmt.



P.T.	Delete reference to “imported material”.  Leave it to	Agreed

	 	White Paper.		Agreed

	Alternative means of introducing competition.



P.M.G.	Many in favour are emphasising competition vice commercial.

A public corpn. financed by adverts.

Sw.	Another B.B.C. wd. unite whole Party against us.

	To introduce this new idea now wd. be v. confusing.

	This is a political issue – handle it on pol. grounds.



S.Ll.	My suggn. referred to all b’casting.  Doubt if it wd. be practicable if confined to t.v.



R.A.B.	Last sentence on p.1. does leave it open to us to introduce the new idea in autumn.



Sal.	WD. it take you beyond entertainment?



R.A.B.	“ ….  terms on which ….”  vice “field”.



			Agreed:  as amended in discussion.



	Announcement.



PMG.	Wd. like to do it to-morrow.



H.C.	Sooner the better.

	Statements in both Houses to-morrow.



			Agreed   PMG. with RAB &amp; H.C. to settle final draft.



R.A.B.	In H/C. shd. be made by L.P.S. – as important statement of policy.



			Agreed   {H.C. to announce in H/C.

			               {PMG.     “         “      H/L.

Sw.	Limited to procession – as news-reel &amp; Press before.



H.C.	Queen’s speech is political statement.
