P.T.	But pressure wd. come – fr. o.a.p. and other quarters.



A.H.	Feeling in H/C. also : it won’t be forgotten.  200 signatures to motion,

		wh. mght. lead to wider concessions.



R.A.B.	War pension claims will be pressed this year.  Wd. cost £1 m. for

		each 1/=.

R.A.B.	Accept Ch.’s draft subject to omitting reference to decision of 

		principle.



D.S.	Prefer R.A.B.’s original formula.  Wider form will arouse controversy.

		Say Cttee to advise on technical issues involved.



Ch.	Wd. get worst of both worlds.  Shall be asked if we have decided – what 	do we say?  Puts Waverley in false posn.  Won’t allay unrest 

		among staff.



P.M.	Shall seem to have decided before we have had the evidence – or 

		before we know how to do it.

	a)	U.S.A. &amp; Australia.



P.M.	Considering publn. of my Treaty with F.D.R.



Ch.	Modus vivendi with U.S. gives us no benefit &amp; prevents us fr. giving

		to Australia secrets we have discovered ourselves.

	Better now to work with A. &amp; prs. S.Africa – freeing ourselves fr. U.S.

		First we must ascertain wtr. A. wd. still be ready to work with us.

		Then seek freedom from U.S.  And, if they make diffies., insist 

		that they work the agreement.



L.P.S.	Support proposal.



Sw.	So do I.

	x|  P.M. 	Ch. with Sw. &amp; R.A.B. to prepare draft tel. to Menzies.

		U.S.



Ch.	Agree.



P.M.	May I m’while ask Eisenhower’s agreemt. to publn. of Treaty with 

	F.D.R.?  He seemed so keen on this before taking office.  Blame

	for its concealment lies with Truman &amp; Byrnes.



L.P.S.	Wd. its publication be advantageous to us? – now.



Sw.	Do you want to play in with U.S. or with Comm?

	Eisenhower’s hands are tied by Act of Congress.



Ch.	Doubt if any harm in publishg. m’while.  Let me consider it

		however – with A.E.  Cttee.



P.M.	No Cttee. need look at this.



S.Ll.	Better ask for this when  we make other approach to U.S.



P.M.           y/	I can at least find out if E. still thinks as he did in Jany.



	b)	Belgium.

P.M.	Can’t spare more than 2 Ministers from H/C. on Wed.    [M/S. shd go 					       [on Thursday.



	S. Lloyd’s draft.



P.M.	1.	(a)	A great mistake to announce a change of defence policy

		now.  No justification for a public change as yet.  Even tho’ we 

		are ourselves slowing down a little.

		(b)	Approve.

		(c)	Austrian Treaty is not a matter to handle at this N.A.T.O. 

		mtg.  There is no conciliatory move fr. R. over Austria.

		(d)	Why decide this (4-Power talks) now.



S.Ll.	This was to be our line in a private debate.  Can’t avoid discussion.



P.M.	We shd. say this is not a good moment to settle (d).

	2.	Approve (go on with E.D.C.).  Shall give it a push in F.A. debate.

	3.	Annual Review.       Approve.

P.M.	Revertg. to 1(d) – approve summary in F.O. print on Sov. Policy since

		Stalin’s death.



R.A.B.	Avoid getting involved in major ques. of policy on this occasion.

		Tho’ we may have to try to get movement over Saar, w’out

		which E.D.C. won’t be settled.



P.M.	On defence policy : say no change at present.  Consider effects of any

		announcemt. Dulles may make.



	*{	N.B. to ask U.S. Embassy wtr. mtg. on off-shore etc., can be

	  {	p’poned until Thursday.

				[Exit  D.S.



	7.	Sudan.



P.M.	We must still try hard to get early elections.  Renny is trying still.

		Govr. shd. be stiffened.

	Officials can give advice, despite Govr.’s attitude.

	Not prepared to allow Govr. to go on leave during this crisis.

		(3½ months)



S.Ll.	Diff. to replace him, if he resigned because need of E. concurrence.

	He shd. come to Ldn. for Coronation : to associate Sudan with it.

		But shd. return at once.



L.P.	Yes : &amp; beat him up while he is here.





	Proposals for expenditure.



W.	V. small.



S.Ll.	Para. 14.  B’castg. fr. Cyprus will centre on Sudan.

		Propose organn. for propaganda apparently coming fr. Sudanese :

		for buying Cotton, &amp; for bribes.



H.C.	Don’t want early Suppl. Estimate.



P.M.	Do this on Secret Vote.



R.A.B.	And spend more.



			                                                        [Enter G.Ll., O.P., Watk.

	8.	Northern Ireland : Unemployment.



M.F.	Serious situation.  General election soon after Coronation.

	Coal subsidy – w’in their powers.  Can we deny them this?  They

		have a case on merits wh. can be differentiated from other

		areas.



R.A.B.	It is v. serious.

	Soundest scheme is remission of employers’ contn. to insurance.

		For basic diffy. is tht. wages are no longer lower than in G.B.

		Try re-imbursing employers : might cost £5M. in the end.

		WD get to root of real trouble – more than coal subsidy wh. 

		wdn’t go to right industries or achieve result.



O.P.	Remission wd. damage insurance scheme – based on principle of

		joint contns. by employers &amp; workers.  Socialists are considering

		abandonment of contrib. principle.  Certainly wd. be demand for

		similar concession to workers.

	Repayment wd. be subsidy to wages.  Better do it directly &amp; not in

		relation to insurance contn.



Watk.	Support O.P.  Workers wd. at once demand remission of their contn.



Ch.	V. dangerous precedent.  WD. be invoked in any area where there is

		unemplt.  WD. only reduce costs by 1%.

	Some once-for-all subsidy e.g. to a new factory, wd. be better.



W.	This is v. diff. fr. general variation of contns. under Emp. Policy 

		W. Paper.  Consider by trades.  E.g. purchase tax relief on linen

		industry.



M.F.	Existg. factories won’t absorb labour.  More factories or extensions are

		needed.  And employers won’t go there to pay same wages and

		higher freights.

	Objns. to all remedies.  But can we tolerate continuance of condns. as 

		now in N.I.



P.M.	More orders – more ships – more factories.  And help to do that.

		cf. defence orders placed by D.S.  Can’t we have a plan for that?

		Cdn’t liners built in G.B. be finished in N.I., to give kind of 

		emplt. needed?



L.	H. &amp; Wolff have elected to build tankers – &amp; have full order book.

		They cdn’t take liner on.



R.A.B.	Ask w. party to look into ques. of increasing orders (with Govt.

		assistance).



P.M.	Favourable Govt. contracts.



O.L.	Interest-free money to build factories – light industries in wh. freight

		charges are less important.



G.Ll. }	Coal is unsound method.

          }

P.M.  }	Give N.I. Govt. the £¾M. &amp; ask them to suggest to us how they

		would use it.



R.A.B.	Ready to give some relief on Imp. contn if an effective &amp; fruitful way

 		of spending it can be found.
