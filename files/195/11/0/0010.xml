C.C. 2(53)							14th January, 1953



		1.	Egypt.	   Defence Negotiations.	        [Enter C.O.S. &amp;  J.T.



A.E.	Texts subject to approval of U.K. and U.S. Govts.

	U.S. accepted our 1st choices.  V. helpful.



C.I.G.S.	Satisfied &amp; welcome U.S. acceptance of our view. They agree tht. Case A is necessary &amp; reasonable.  Anything less wd. mean long interval betwn. outbrk. of war &amp; re-activation of base.  Must go for case A.  On conduct of negotns. we hope to get U.S. to join in workg. out details (who is to be left in base, respons. For care of stores).  Wd. be v. helpful.

	If guerrilla warfare started &amp; we had to reinforce, we shd. have to embody some T.A. Divns.



Sal.	Para.7.  “our w’drawal cd. only be made to pave way to good will”.  Not to appease only.  To secure agreement – good will following.



A.E.	Badly worded.  Envisage this as genl. agreemt. – a package.

	Will re-consider that paragraph.  Para.9(b) puts it clearly enough.



C.I.G.S.	If negotns. go well, we shall be pressed to expedite w’drawal.  We can’t do it in less than 18 mos. – w’out hardship &amp; waste of materials.  U.S. accept that.

	Equipment &amp; aid : none until they show real signs of makg. agreemt.



A.E.	E. have purchasing commn. now in U.S. – to buy $10m.  I induced Byroade to give no more than $5m. to start with.  They will give something.  C.O.S. shd. press U.S. mil. authies. not to go too fast.

	I will report conclns. to P.M.





		2.	Sudan.



A.E.	Disturbing that our E. visitor shd. achieve so much, w’out our knowing much about it.

	3 Tels. passed round.

	Favour 3(b) in F.O. tel. 67.  (a) wd. be satisf., but E. v. unlikely to accept.

	Weakness of (b) is tht. South will be in minority in Parlt.  But v. diff. for us to go on defendg. South if all the Parties in S. have given up doing so.

	Shd. Cab. nominate small group on Sudan?



R.A.B.	I think (b) is best line. We shall have criticisms in H/C.



Sim.	South mustn’t boycott the Elections.



R.A.B.	Religious leaders have now gone over, with pol. Parties, to E. view.

		Committee appointed.



							[Exit C.O.S.

		3.	Iceland Fishery Dispute.	[Enter T.D., H.G., H.S. &amp; Att.G.



A.E.	Thors seems willing to go to Ct. on Faxa Bay alone. This is best on whole, tho’ it doesn’t suit Scots who fish elsewhere.

		Generally agreed : no alternative, tho’ not v. satisfy. 

Att.G.	V. satisfy. if Iceland willing so to limit it.



J.T.	Admy. wd. prefer to avoid Ct. until U.S. views clear.



A.E.	U.S. (because base) unlikely to be helpful.

	Better, fr. Admy view, to restrict it to Bay.  More dangerous to go to Ct. on whole of terr. waters issue.

	We shd. not concede the 4 mile limit.

	We shd. make the reference clear, with Icelanders.



T.D.	Trawlers can’t be shifted.  And they are landing fish, m’while.



Sw.	Don’t press them any more.

							[Exit J.T.  Enter Snadden



		4.	Control of Cereals &amp; Feedingstuffs.



T.D.	Farmers fear freedom.  Also nervous of being let down on Pt. I of Agric Act.



	They won’t accept respons. for estimate of demand : not content with assurances of supply : think the whole thing v. risky.

	They want assurances on Pt. I before de-control to restore confidence &amp; prevent Unions coming out in opposn. to Govt. plan.

	We can’t give them assurances wh. will satisfy them : but we are discussing with Ty.  This is linked with eggs.  We may have trouble with farmers.

	With this warning, I support the scheme.  This is our chance – otherwise we shall never escape into free-er economy.



H.G.	Diffies. of trade are greater – yet only 2 Assocns. opposed this plan.

	4 gave unqualified, 16 qualified, approval.  The problems they raise will arise whenever decontrol occurs.

	Flour is what affects the public.  National loaf : but whiter cd. be made w’out subsidy.  Saving : £13M.  Home-made loaf will be dearer – by 4d. p. head p. wk.  Nos. now are not v. large.

	On pastry etc., only ½ or 1d. a wk. increased cost.

	May be some cheating by bakers.  Examining means of checking it.

	Stocks : farmers are unduly pessimistic.  Cdn’t buy, ships or store the extra amount suggested by farmers.  2½ tons.



R.A.B.		V. diff. pol. sitn. threatens in rural areas.

	Must go ahead with this.  We believe in abandong. control : if we don’t do this now we shall never get rid of it.  No fundamental diffy. on this, with farmers, that we can’t get round.

	Reserve proposed by farmers we cdn’t afford.  Have given formula (not in terms of £10M.) with wh. they must be content.  Will also set aside ½ m. for small men.

	Small farmers &amp; new ones (not enjoying 3g. basis) will like it.



	?5. [sic] Eggs is more diff.  No marketing scheme ready.  First class crisis on that.  They have put in alternative on marketg. bd. lines.

	This may not cure black market.  But M/Ag. shd. consider it.

	May find an alternative – somewhere betwn. the two.  Pol. wise to take longer over that.

	Demand for assurance on Pt. I. is near blackmail.  Refuse general promise : offer to discuss commodity by commodity.  Say that. if we have to alter policy we will do it cleanly, not going behind Act.



T.D.	Agree with R.A.B.’s view.  Row over eggs goes pretty wide – first proposal for free market : this brings out Pt. I. point.  Long-term stability.

	We ought to consider their alternative plan for eggs.



A.E.	Para.3 – requirement on millers to add ingredients : is it necessary?



H.G.	Millers make no bones about it?



Ch.	Did people no harm pre-war.



Sw.	J.S. supports M/Ag. tho’ he cdn’t sign the memo.



Sw.	Canada will want informn. about method.  Will trade have the dollars to buy in cheapest market?  Or will there be a dollar ration?



R.A.B.	If addl. imports needed, there will have to be rapid deliveries : therefore no discrimn. v. dollars.  We shall get supplies where we can.

	X  R.A.B., Sw., &amp; H.G. to confer on this, together with B/T.  X

	Before announcement is made.



H.M.	Will the trade have the finance to take this on?



H.G.	We have bn. discussing this with them, with Ty.



H.C.	Statement.  V. long.  Wd. prefer a Wh. Paper.  Can that be considered.



H.G. &amp; T.D.	Wd. prefer that.



		Suggns. for amendment to go to Ministers in writing.

		(Consult Agric. M.P.’s before W.Paper comes out?)



							[Exit H.S. Snadden.

		5.	Coronation : Food Supplies.



H.G.	Marg. &amp; fat : I shd. have to buy it.  Take up only 90% now.

	Ox-roasting : wdn’t be more than 500.  Not keen, but pressed by supporters.



R.A.B.	Agree with memo.





		6.	Persia.						[Exit T.D. H.G.

								            [Enter G.H.



A.E.	As in memo.  U.S. are now in line with what is proposed.

	Form of Arbitn.  M. will want U.K. Govt. acting on behalf of A.I.O.C.  If so, it’s not a brkg. point.

	Reln. to commercial sales is now more satisf.  It is now linked with DUMPA.  And U.S. have given verbal promise tht. they won’t go on giving money if P. doesn’t come along with comm.. sales. agreemt.

	They will advance $130 m. – 100 m. to M. and 33 m. into escrow.  Pretty good bargain for us.

	A.I.O.C. are well pleased.



Att.G.	Get that in writing.  Want to be able to say publicly tht. t. of r. are approved by C.O.



A.E.	Subject to final agreemt. of C.O., we shall go ahead on this basis.

	Agreemt. needed before 22/1.



							[Exit Att.G.

		7.	Coal Prices.



L.	£8M. loss by N.C.B. on years’ working (estimated).  Due to constant local adjustment of wages, wh. can’t be estimated closely in advance.

	More of that this year because of no nat. agreemt. on wage increase.

	N.C.B. now think settlemt. with N.U.M. on 150.000 lower paid will be reached soon – at 6/=, or a little more.  We cd. take that into a/c.  Then, w’in next 2 wks., we cd. authorise early increase in price – in order to save further loss on 1953 working.  Looks like a 10% increase.

	Average of 5/6d. p. ton (6/= on domestic : 4/6 on electricity coal : 5/9d. on rlway coal).

	Increase is inevitable.



R.A.B.	No decision until wages award is given.

	£36M. deficiency in ’53 if this increase not made.  10% increase (less tax) will bring in only about £33M.



Sw.	Announce v. soon after wage increase – link it closely with that.

	Put the blame on miners.



G.H.	Will be consequential rise in gas prices – about 6 wks. later.

L.	Mght forecast that in original announcemt.



								[Enter D.S.

		8.	Atomic Energy Organisation.



H.C.	No reflection on M/Supply or Minister.  Faulty organisation.

	Details shd. be examined by Cttee. of experts.  Opposn. shd. be consulted because wd. be contrary to Parly. views on grant-in-aid.



D.S.	Proby. wd. be better if it had bn. organised this way at outset.

	On long-term prob. advantages in makg. change.



Ch.	Diffies. in transition.  Hope experts will help us with that.



A.E.  	I will report to P.M., who can settle composn. of Cttee.



R.A.B.	Don’t think this is sound.  Wd. prefer remit to Waverly to leave ques. of principle open.  But can’t press my view further.



A.E.	Language in para.5. meets R.A.B.



O.L.	Surely we can take a decision of principle now.

	Industrial use may be some way ahead ; but it will come &amp; Dpl. organn. can’t handle it.



		Agreed : Waverly to seek way thro’ diffies.



								[Exit G.H.

		9.	Alan Nunn May.



M.F.	(a)	Employment.



W.M.	He wants to be empld. here.  Lookg. for work for him in medical research.

	He doesn’t want to go abroad.



M.F.	He may decide to go to Argentine.



	(b)	Change of Name.



M.F.	Wants to drop the Nunn.





	10.	Iron &amp; Steel Bill.



D.S.	Much feeling about foundries.  Much exaggerated – or worked up.

	Discussed wth interests concerned : amendmts. devised wh. meet fears w’out going beyond assurances given on 2nd Rdg.

	Met repves. y’day : agreed statement publd. today.  Stress last sentence.



		11.	The Royal Title.				[Exit D.S.

								            [Enter B.H.

		a) Latin version.

Sim.	As in memo.



M.F.	J.S. warns Cab. tht. there may be trouble over Eliz II.



	b) Bill.

H.C.	Consult Opposition.



Sal.	Can take this in H/L.



M.F.	On W.Paper : omit “subject to the will of Parlt.” and insert “subject to passage of R.Titles Bill”.



		Agreed : subject to that amendment.



							[Enter Sw. &amp; Solr. Genl.

		12.	Leasehold Reform.



H.C.	May this start in H/Lords?  



Sal.  	Yes.



	White Papers approved.
