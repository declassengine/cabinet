C.C. 64(53).				9th November, 1953.



	Trieste.	                                    [Enter  3 Serv. Ministers &amp; C.O.S.



A.E.	Trying for conference.  By Frid. had agreed proposals, wh. had 

		chance of success.  Tel. 2429 from W’ton.  Offers to I. small

		transfer in Zone A. &amp; to Y. guarantee of finality &amp; refce. to 

		hinterland of T.

	Riots, however, create new Sitn.

		i)	Can we go on, with 2429 plan, in view of It. behaviour 

			in T.  Para. 2. doesn’t go v. far :  in particular, doesn’t 

			involve hand-over of Police.  Arguments against :  4607 to

			W’ton.  But U.S. reject those arguments &amp; deprecate delay :

			2433 fr. W’ton.  Formidable.  Main objn. to delay is risk tht.

			Y. will publish their plan.

	U.S. have supported our troops &amp; commr. v. strongly. 

		Adml. Radford is willing to go to T. – he will warn Belgrade in

		advance.  He wd. support our comms.

	Mrs. Luce is also a reason v. delay.

	Bidault’s view :  (Paris tel. 446 of this a.m.)  Sees diffy. in going ahead

		&amp; was divided in his view.  Balanced view.  Thinks It. favours 

		delay :  but Y. not.  Wd. on whole favour going ahead if Dulles 

		presses.  Pella has since asked him to favour delay &amp; promised

		further message in a few days.

	Do Cabinet i)  approve plan as best move.

			 ii)  agree tht. we go on with it now – or consider that, 

			            despite strong U.S. view, we shd. delay.

	Disposed, on whole, to go ahead – provided U.S. &amp; we are determined

		not to hand over control of Police to Italy.



CIGS.	Winterton has agreed the concessions.  But any concessions will be

		regarded as sign of weakness, by both sides, and will therefore

		weaken internal security sitn.



Al.	Looks like a reward for bad behaviour.

	Rioting was obviously organised.



A.E.	Not by It. Govt. – but prob. by Comm. &amp; Fascists, who both oppose

		I.’s integration with the West.



P.M.	Wd. prefer to mark time and keep order.

	If Y. think concessions result fr. It. bad behaviour, they will say they 

		had better do a bit of it themselves.



C.I.G.S.	Cd. we propose confce. w’out offer of transfer?



A.E.	Y. will then think we intend to give them much more.

		We shan’t publish the concessions.



Al.	Cd. you p’pone transfers in § 2  until order is restored?

A.E.	Supposed It. wd. not come to Confce. w’out some such promise –

	If we delay, how long do we leave it?  It is quiet now.  P. is due to

		go to T. soon.  Y. will publish their plan – wh. will have big

		public appeal.  And our sensible plan will be lost.

	Fr. officials agree with U.S.  B. favours that on balance.



P.M.	Natural course for U.S. &amp; U.K. wd. be to say tht. hopes of solution

		have bn. frustrated.  Troops must stay for some months – &amp; will

		keep. order.  Strong warning on this fr. both sides.  One month’s

		respite before we resume discussions.  I wd. like to take this 

		line ;  but of course wd. have to carry U.S. with us.

	Remember P. and T. are both in diffies. domestically.

	Disposed to have another go at U.S. – to try to persuade them to this 

		view.  If they insist on takg. wrong decision, they must take 

		their full share of its consequences.



J.T.	3 Frigates due to make routine visit to T.  Shd. be there on 12/11.  Do

		we cancel that?



P.M.	Confer with F.O.  Disposed to p’pone.  No moment to fraternise.



V.C.N.S.	We have no ships there.  Won’t have any festivities – shall tell

		them that.



P.M.	We shd. have equal force with U.S. – who have a destroyer.



R.A.B.	Don’t like 2(1).

	P. fears we shall go ahead &amp; let them down.  Let them reflect for a 

		few days on consequences of bad behaviour.

	Have one more shot at U.S.



A.E.	| Shd. I tell Y. we have some ideas but can’t now put them fwd.

                      x|	for a time because of row in T.

	Disadv. of delay.  P. goes to T. on 12/11.  Y. will publish their plan.



P.M.	One more shot at U.S.  If they won’t delay :  say, we hope you are

		right :  we will go along with you.



H.C.	Support x/ &amp; press specifically tht. they shdn’t publish their plan

		m’while.



A.E.	Statement in H/C. this p.m.           Agreed – subject to adjustments.
