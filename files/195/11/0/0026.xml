 							S.Lloyd. Maudling.



L.B.	Large nos. in new aircraft : M.P.’s  Manufrs. anxious tht. M.P.’s shd. be satisfied.

	Manufrs. havg. invited a no. of M.P.’s to ground display, then asked them to fly – &amp; Labour Members accepted.

	Manufrs. unwilling now to put it off on pretext of a technical hitch.

	Flight element has now bn. cancelled.

	But can parties of 4 or 5 M.P.’s be allowed to do this in future.



P.M.	Was proposed to take 40 up together.  Think of constitutional diffies. which wd. arise if all were killed.

	Don’t object to parties of 4 or 5.  Or rather, 2 or 3.  Or 2.



L.B.	Rule cdn’t be enforced thro’ Corpns. alone.  These are private companies.

	Wd. have to be arranged thro’ Party Whips.



B.H.	Not more than 2 on each side – maximum of 4.



P.M.	Willing to agree to that – chosen by Air Cttee.



L.-B.	Will you explain to C.R.A.?  



P.M. 	Ch. Whip can do it thro’ u. channels.





		2.	Japan : Sterling Area Trade in 1953.



P.M.	Read telegram (520) giving views of A.E. &amp; R.A.B.



Ch.	We cd. try the Cttee’s. line &amp; tell our negotiators to refer back if J, won’t take it.  I don’t think they will.



Sw.	Pol. diffies. here in going v. much further than that.



P.M.	Conscious of those – Lancs.  Also prejudice v. Japanese e.g. ill treatmt. of p.o.w. etc.



S.H.	Para. 11 is difficulty.



M.	Para. 10 of my memo. will meet views of A.E. &amp; R.A.B.



P.T.	But don’t ask J. what they want.



		Agreed :  as in para. 10 of Maudling’s memo.



							[Exit S.Ll., Maudling.

		3.	Adult Education.			[Enter M/Ed., Fin. Secy.



P.M.	No decision had bn. taken.  Have drafted reply to Tewson.



F.H.	Wd. prefer to omit refce. to waste until I have the facts.

	“No wish to reduce the total amount …. ”  WD. prefer to say “no wish to take any steps wh. wd. have adverse effect on total …. ”



P.M.	Don’t want a row all round for sake of £250,000.



F.H.	Courses &amp; pupils are decreasing while cost is rising.



P.M.	Don’t reduce the total this year.  



H.M.  	Give more to the good ones.



B-C.	Estimates will show redn. of £27.000 on adult education – for these bodies &amp; Universities.  Now printing.

		Agreed :	Estimate to be altered to show no reduction.

				P.M. to reply – amended to meet points in discn.

				Decision when facts are known.





		4.	Teachers’ Superannuation.



J.S.	Fund will run into deficit.  Agreed we must force teachers to pay more.  Legn. will be needed.  Shd. it be interim measure only to raise contns., or shd. some addl. points be included.



F.H.	Bill will be opposed.  L.a.’s want time for radical review of 1925 Act.

	If we aren’t going to have early legn. it wd. be wiser to allow that.

	Cd. then have decn. next year with less opposn. from interests.



Ch.	I question calculations.  There is no fund : it’s notional.  Will be v. diff. to explain.

	Why antagonise all teachers for £1M.



H.M.	If no legn. this session, what of Bill in para. 8 – an “agreed measure” wh. will be hotly opposed. Will give us valuable experience.  Wait and profit by it – esp. as we have an Actuary’s mistake in ours.



F.H.	Support delay.



B-C.	Actuary has reported (1951) tht. contns. won’t cover liabilities.

	Deficit increases with delay.

H.C.	No time for this legn. in present Session.	                    [Exit B-H.

	It can wait a year.  Discns. m’while to get somewhere nearer an agreed measure.



		Agreed :  No legn. this session.

B-C.	ShD. married unaccompanied allowce. announced last night for Army &amp; R.A.F., apply to shore-based ratings.  Cost v. small £100.000.



P.M.	How cd. you justify paying more to those ashore than to those who brave the greater risks afloat.

	Discrimn. v. R.N. is justified. For men joined it on basis tht they wd. be separated fr. their wives &amp; all sorts of arrangemts. were made on that basis.  Recruitg. is going well.  Army has, however, undergone a revoln. now tht. all are overseas.



J.T.	Since war equality betwn. Services has bn. preserved.  And R.N. men will be workg. alongside others ashore (with no sea-going privileges).  Enquiries from ports already, since y’day’s announcement.  Only 1.800 men are involved.



P.M.	Don’t offer it.  If a row develops, we can consider it.
