C.C. 39 (53)					6th July, 1953



56.	    The P.M.

				[Enter S.L.l., B.H.

Text of P.M.’s reply given to Cabinet.





1.	    Regency.

58)	

M.F.	Queen’s point tht. D/E. shd. continue as Regent if Queen is incapacitated and both children are dead.



Sim.	Cd. be argued tht. Pr. Margaret, as heir presumptive, shd. then have experience of public business.



M-F.	V. hypothetical – pity to go v. Her wishes.

		

1)	Half Agreed : meet Queen’s wishes on this point.



	Timing.



Sal.	In view of Press references to Margaret, I favour p’ponement.

For it wd. be thght. tht. Bill was presented because M. is unsuitable to act.  This wd. be underlined if Bill presented now.



H.C.	Esp. when M. is out of country.

	Cd. be done in spill-over – or even in new Session, message being incorporated in Q. Speech.



J.S.	Endorse.



M-F.	Fairer to p’pone.



Sw.	Agree.



			Agreed:   M-F. to discuss again with H.M. in light of Cab. 

	                discussion.

1)	can then be discussed further at leisure.





1.	    Foreign Affairs.



59)	(a) General Approach

60)	

Sal.	Slight change of emphasis as cpd. with what W.S.C. intended for B’muda. His main aim then was to press for 4-Power Mtg.

That remains our aim.  But circs. have changed.

	i)	P.M.’s prelimy. talk with Ike can’t take place for some time.

ii)	U.S. are allergic to 4 Power Mtg.  No one short of P.M. cd. bring them round.  For me to press them too hard wd. spoil their help on other matters.

iii)	German elections are nearer.  Thus, instead of urging an early date, say I’m trying to clear the way for a mtg. later by removg some causes of misunderstanding.



	Minute from P.M.



	Welcome concln. – early ratification of E.D.C., followed by F. Power Mtg.

Might get U.S. to accept in principle &amp; agree to further 3 Power

		 -g in Sept.

       	x| 	In communiqué repeat belief in free elections in J. and united G.



S.Ll.	Wonder if P.M., isn’t a little optimistic re J. never allying with R.

	Wd. like momentum to be preserved e.g. by refce. to x/ in communiqué.



Sal.	Believe Fr. are wholly negative – won’t have EDC : won’t agree to anything at 4-Power Mtg. which they accept only as means of buying further delay.

	They discard all alternatives.

	I believe E.D.C. is better than either neutralising G. or bringing into N.A.T.O.



Al.	Need for G. help to ensure defence of w. Europe.

	G. freedom to have own Army is more serious for F. than G. contr. in E.D.C.



H.M.	Fr. have always regarded E.D.C. as means of dividing G. permanently.

Sch/de Gasp/Aden : federalism of Europe.  Fr. welcomed it as means of avoidg. united G.  We disbelieved in federalism.  They have now accepted our view tht. it won’t work in practice : they now see tht. their conceptn. of it as means of holding G. will not materialise.

Don’t believe Fr. will ever ratify.

	Future of E. turns on G.  Our main purpose in short run is to get Aden. back.  He has championed E.D.C. &amp; “federalism”.  He can’t resist criticism tht. he has delayed unificn. of G. E. German events have underlined that.  Emphasis on 4 Power Mtg. is necessary now, to enable Ad. to pose as champion of G. unity.

	Support E.D.C. up to limit of membership.  Go for 4 Power Mtg., in order to assist moderate opinion in G.



Sw.	Fr. will try to p’pone ratifn. of E.D.C.  Will you ask U.S. to say to Fr. :  

“if you won’t ratify in autumn, we shall propose G. into N.A.T.O.”

What other sanction to force Fr. hand.



Sal.	U.S. will take lead.  We cd. support them in pressing Fr. to state publicly at once tht. ratifn. is part of their policy – preferably in W’ton communiqué.  Then press then for a date, at our next mtg.



S.Ll.	Bidault will say – leave timing to me.

	They won’t do it w’out ultimatum.  Give that later.



H.M.	Don’t want E.D.C. with united G. in it.  WD. rather see that in NATO.  But we can’t take that line yet.



R.A.B.	I agree.



Sal.	No ultimatum until after G. elections  i.e. at next mtg.



H.M.	Put it on basis : G. must be with West – if not in EDC then in another way e.g. in N.A.T.O.



Sal.	Add to para 15 (6) - &amp; secure agreemt. of U.S. &amp; French to a further (Bermuda) mtg after G. elections.



		C. (53) 187 – approved, subject to above.

		C. (53) 186 – approved.





	(b) Egypt.



Sal.	E. has had no encouragemt. fr. Dulles, or I &amp; P.P.M’s.

	Do we allow them to stew a bit longer?  Or do we resume?  - with U.S. support?

	Dulles’ plan is unacceptable   -  Agreed.

	Alternatives I &amp; II in memo are the choice.

	Alternative I.  Unlikely to get E. to agree to ii) or iii).

	     ”        II – not so good : doubt if U.S. wd. support it.

	I favour going on – on basis of I.

	Message fr. Nehru : 23/7 is anniversary of Revoln. : N. likely to make rash statement unless we can offer to resume before then.

	If I can get U.S. to support I – we cdn’t carry anything less with U.K. opinion – I wd. send R. back to Cairo at once &amp; allow E. to spk. to them before 23/7.



L.	Will this give enough security for Canal?  Cd. you get. U.S. more interested in that.  Out duty to Maritime Powers.



R.A.B.	Cd. we put it into Case A : para. 1 of Cairo tel. 996.



S.Ll.	Intended to make separate deal on Canal.  U.S. have now agreed to hold talks on that with U.S./Fr./U.K.  Cd. get support of maritime countries more easily if Canal were separately handled.



R.A.B.	P.M.’s attd. importce.  Delay in getting consortium.  Even Case A wd. leave canal weaker than now.  If separate agreemt., wd. have to be contemporaneous.



Sal.	Alt. I is agreemt. with E.

	Canal is argument with U.S.

	I shd. stress importce. of Canal as reason for their supporting us re Base.



R.A.B.	(iii) If aggression v. U.K., our need for Base wd. be urgent.



Sal.	True.  We are concerned with a world war.  iii) as worded is too localised.



R.A.B.	It wasn’t so limited in Case A.



Sal.	Prefer formula in 2(iv) – but not a private undertakg.



			Agreed. Sal. will re-consider this point.

			              Also Canal agreemt. shd. be simultaneous.



R.A.B.	i) Tories will insist that Base shd. be able to defend itself.

Cairo 995.  Wd. Case A. para. 1 be good enough?

(Same arrangemt. as for U.S. bases in U.K.)



Sal.	Base wd. go under E. control : certain installations remaing. under Br. control.



Al.	Defence is to say that attack on base wd. be act of war, v. wh. we shd. retaliate.



W.M.	Para 5 of Cairo telegram.



Al.	Can’t secure that w’out 2 Divns.

	Moreover, can’t use a base in war with a hostile populn.



R.A.B.	ii) 5 years.  Cd. it be longer?



Sal.	P.M. wants 10 yrs.  But unlikely to get it.  Doesn’t matter if we also get second part – equivalent to a M.E.D.O.



	(c) Korea.



Sal.	If no armistice, bound to agree to convening Assembly.  Nehru wants it early.  Wiser to give U.S. every chance of getting Rhee into line.  Shall support any U.S. request for longer time.



	(d) Indo-China



O.L.	Press U.S. to give more help to Indo-China.

	We cdn’t, by holding S. Peninsula, ensure tht. Malaya remains untroubled.





	Consultn. with Commonwealth.



Sw.	We must tell old Doms. what our line will be on Egypt.

	We can tell all Doms. our line on 4 Power Mtg. etc.,





1.	    Television.

60)	

W.	Cab. suggested Central Office shd. say nothg. on this pro-tem.

	Tories in H/C. are urging us to put the case.

	I cd. hold this until Cab. had discussed.

	May Central Office now put out material in support of statement made – viz., adhering to principle of competition, not necessarily sponsored.

	Our supporters are askg. tht. the case for competn. shall now be stated in propaganda.



R.A.B.	Find Tory sponsors to put their names to it.  Allow C. Office to print it.



W.	Whose imprint?



R.A.B.	Want to read C. Office draft.  Don’t mind C. Office imprint, so long as authors put their names to it.



W.	Or C. Office official propaganda in support of L.P.S. statement.



R.A.B.	Will give you definite line on Thursday.
