C.C. 78(53).				14th December, 1953.



	1.	Railways :  Wages Dispute.     [Enter  ALB., B.H., G.Ll., Birch.



W.M.	Mtgs. to-day with all parties:  3 Unions separately &amp; then B.T.C.

	Award made by estd. machiny of industry awarded 4/=.  They

		thght 7/6 :  even I expected 5/= or 5/6.  Indignantly refused.

	Discns. over week-end.  All 3 have gt. confidence in B. Robertson –

		who has combined firmness &amp; impn. of fairness.

	His suggn. :  “B.T.C. has confirmed acceptce. of award.  It is ready to 

		implement it.  If this posn. is accepted by Unions, BTC will

		examine whole wage &amp; salary structure i) to remove anomalies

		ii) to provide incentives where necessary.  BTC wd. also like

		to confer with Unions to involve ways of increasg efficiency

		of rlway organn., not only by wages but other means.”

	Two of 3 Unions were ready to accept this – tho’ one is now trying

		to slide out of it.

	B.R. also promised prelimy. mtg. before Xmas &amp; will consider first 

		those said to be below subsistence level.

	N.U.R. are standing out.  Will see them again to-morrow.

		Trying to find means of modifying this to provide a way out 

		for N.U.R.  But i)   mustn’t undermine posn. of tribunal.

			                 ii)  if B.T.C. offered to review, lowest-paid wd.

		come first &amp; even 1/= on their pay wd. mean £1½M.

	V. diff. posn.  Not at all confident.

	Buses wd. come out too.



G.Ll.	Mines wd. stop in 10 days because coal cdn’t move fr. pits.



H.M.	Cd. award be made retrospve. e.g. to 1/1.



W.M.	Wd. mean amendg. award at once.  Also 3 mos. to alter wage structure,

		and m’while heavy loss on fares etc.



ALB.	They can raise charges now, on a/c of unexpected extra costs before 

	going to Tribunal



Sim.	Loss, even on 2 wks’ strike, wd. exceed cost of makg. award 

	retrospective.



R.A.B.	B.R.’s text offers a real basis for negotn.

	Farm workers got 6/= for less reason.  Rlwaymen have a good case.



W.M 	Lower wage rate = £5=17=6.  But most earn about £8. 



ALB.	Agree.  Campbell is convinced by B.R.  It’s a ques of saving his face.

	Action needed in event of strike.



M-F.	i)	Offl. Cttee. think emergency wd. have to be declared under 1920

			Act. (as Labour Govt. did for dock strike).  But if Parlt.

			isn’t sitting, it must be recalled in 5 days &amp; continue to sit.

			Rgs. made must be confirmed by both Houses w’in 7 days.

	ii)	Service Xmas leave.  Half R.N. will go off to-morrow.  Other

			Services go on Friday.  Cd. wait until Wed. before 

			suspending their leave.  So as to secure techn. services.

	iii)	Shd. have to call for volunteers – thro’ Labour Exchanges.

	iv)	Consultns. with outside interests will be needed :  informn. of our

			intentions wd. leak.

	v)	Early G.P.O. announcemt. re modificn. of Xmas mails.

	Govt. organn. cd. be completed by end of this week.

		Agreed :  Announce Cab. consn. of this.

			       Be ready to meet again to-morrow.



	2.	Egypt.



P.M.	Outlined a plan for handling the 40 Tory dissidents.  (Not heard 

		by me.)



H.C.	Alternative :  make statemt. at 1922 Cttee. lunch on Wedy.



P.M.	Cd. say then – you mustn’t try to exact pledges fr. Govr. but I can

		assure you we aren’t actuated by fear.  We have handled this

		posn. firmly :  you must trust us to continue to handle it thus.

		Promise to explain mil. consns. to a small no. in confidence.



H.C.	Won’t meet demand for mil. exposn.



P.M.	Cdn’t give one easily before our future course of known.

	Ready to explain in debate in H/C. then.

	Cd. make strong case for re-deploymt. of these forces once decn. on E.

		agreemt. was taken.  Not easily before then.

	Cd. also say on Wed. tht. we shall also bear in mind the mil. value of

		m’taining our prestige.



R.A.B.	They have got to point of acceptg. small force in a strong point.

		Haven’t yet seen you can’t have small force in unfriendly

		country.  This cd. be made clear to them in an exposn.



O.L.	You (P.M.) wd. have to put mil. arguments on that narrow point.

		We want brig. group in friendly country, not hostile.



RAB.	They haven’t even understood diffy. of going into Cairo.



P.M.	Not ready to do this now.



H.C.	Necessary now if you want to stop another 30/names being added

		to motion.



P.M.	Wd. they vote v. us?  Do they want a dissolution now?



B.H.	Many of them wd. go to gt. lengths, fr. mixed motives.

		Dissatisfied at not being told mil. arguments.  They asked for

		this a long time ago.



J.S.	Alex. cd. talk to them.  He is willing.

	They don’t want a dissoln.  But they feel v. strongly.



P.M.	Suppose they voted with Bevanites v. us, on adjournment :  we cd. put

		up a vote of confidence.  Then we cd. lay the full case before

		H/C.



H.C.	1940 change of Govt. was forced on adjournment – and solely by

		abstentions.



P.M.	Plenty else for discn. in F.Aff. debate on Thursday.

		Doubt if this will come to an issue on that occasion.



B.H.	But discontent will continue, &amp; motion will remain on Paper.



H.M.	If a mtg. held on Wed., let M/D. do it on basis of mil. lecture with

		only one H/C. Minister in Chair.



P.M. (earlier)		Prefer private mtg. in private house with hard-core.



B.H.	That wdn’t meet the need.



P.M.	Don’t agree :  but its only tactics, not principle.  Do it that way if you

		like.



J.S.	Dinner for 30 at St. Stephen’s Club with Alex. as guest.  Cd. then be

		restricted to them.



		Ch. Whip &amp; J.S. to consider means &amp; report to P.M. this p.m.
