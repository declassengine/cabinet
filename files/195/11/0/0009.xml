C.C. 1(53)							6th January, 1953



		1.	Persia.					[Enter G.H., Att.G.



A.E.	M. has accepted arbitns. – because of $100 m. loan.  We want also to secure satisfn. on future flow of oil, wh. will alone pay for the compensn.  Best way is to link them.  Awkward because we have h’to sought to separate them.



	Arbitration : we shd. be able to get round the diffies.

	Court will prob. be unwilling to constitute a panel – but we shd. not involve ourselves in that.

	Get U.S. to give no more than 30% of the $100 m. – holding remainder until oil begins to flow.

	We shall then have ques which oil co. M. will deal with in future.  Clear it can’t be a B. registered co.  But A.I.O.C. wd. have to do all or most of the actual handling of the business.

	Gain tht. M. will now accept arbitn.  Doubt is wthr. M. is genuine.  If no oil flows, there will be no payment of compensn. : and we shall all look v. silly.  Must therefore link future sales of oil with the doling out of $100 m.



L.	Marketing Council (under Marcus) claims to have contract with M.

	They will have to forego this if they can’t implement it in a few days.

	M. reluctant to accept link of oil sales with compn. because of his commitmt. to Marcus.  Hope we can get this out of the way before we go further.

	Don’t want to strengthen Marcus’ hand.  U.S. have given him more encouragemt. than they shd.



Sw.	Consortium incldg. U.S. big cos. wd. keep Marcus out.



A.E.	We are working out a scheme for this, to put to U.S. Govt.

	M.’s reference to confirmn. by Majlis is an argument for paying the $100 m. by instalments.



R.A.B.	Endorse memo.

	Reserve my posn. only on form of consortium.

	Must get oil flowing.



W.M.	M. has moved away fr. compn. only for value of assets – to a readiness to consider compensn. for what we shd. have made if concession had continued.



A.E.	Received message fr. Henderson – hope U.K. won’t insist on linking future sales to compensn. arbitn.  Want immed. advance of $50 m. plus agreemt. for interim sales by U.S. agency.



L.	25% of receipts on U.S. agency sales is set aside for our compensn. fund.

	75% of it goes towards payment of $100m. loan.

	Only new thing in this message is $50 m. instalment : whereas we prefer $30 m.



A.E.	Tell him we prefer $30 m., compromise on $40 m.

	But insist tht. consortium be announced simultaneously with other points.  For purposes of presentn.



O.L.	Isn’t it a bit much to insist, as in (b), tht. first instalment of $ 100 m. shd. be accompanied by a contract re consortium.



A.E.	We mght. be content with an assurance tht. he will agree to marketing via a consortium.



O.L.	Or say “no further payments unless there is an agreement …..”



L.	Leave it as at (b).



A.E.	Urge U.S. not to give more than $30 m. as first instalment.



H.M.	Or $50 m if the whole package can be secured.



		Agreed :	Interim reply to Henderson as in 					amended draft.  

				A.E. : &amp; others to see Byroade  i) 					Marcus out  ii) $ 30 m. for 1st instalment 				iii) some assurance fr. M. re consortium.

Authy. to go to $50 for the whole package.  Remaining $50 m. to be paid only if consortium is in operation.  Perhaps by separate, but consistent, time- tables for each.

Sim.	T. of reference.



Att.G.	Have Co.’s legal advisers considered draft?

	They follow in main the reference for Coal Natn. award.



Sim.	(b) don’t read.  



Att.G. 	They do follow the Coal formula.  



G.H. 	And are approved by Co.’s advisers.



H.C.	Cdn’t we relate it to Coal Royalties via Nationalisn.



W.M.	No need : compensn. formula was agreed betw. Govt. &amp; coal-owners.



Sim.	Add to (b) “to be determined by Tribunal”.



		Sim., Att. G.,  G.H. &amp; W.M. to consider.

							[Exit G.H. and Att.G.



		2.	Duke of Edinburgh : Instruction in Flying.



de L.	Has flown 20 hrs., &amp; solo.

	Ques is wthr. he shd. now go to advanced type of aircraft.



CAS.	Apt. pupil.  He shd. fly 2 intermediate types – Harvard accepted type of aircraft.  Not Balliol, which is less well tried. – tho he wd. prefer it.

	After that Anson.  Before he flies Devon or Dove.



A.L.	I wdn’t allow him to fly jets.

	But he has or will have a Devon or Dove.  He shd. learn to fly that.

	Go to Wings’ standard.  But if he flies a 2 seater he shd. have a co-pilot with him.

	Much more dangerous if he isn’t allowed to complete his training.



C.A.S.	Go on to Harvard Stage.  Then re-consider further stages.  P.M. will be back by then (Feb).

							[Exit C.A.S. &amp; de L.



		3.	Transport : Passenger Fares.



L.B.	Where charges scheme exists B.T.C. have no need to ask my consent to go to Tribunal.  Their appln. is restd. to Ldn., wh. is politically awkward.

	Also tht. decn. will be announced at end/April, shortly before municipal elections.  Can’t interfere with course of “justice”.

	Want to keep it in public eye tht. decision, when it comes, is Trib. not Govt.



Sw.	i) Is this the only one on this round – not to be followed by appln. for provinces.

	ii) Cd. objectors ask for another month – to spin out beyond elections.



L.B.	i) is correct.  ii) can be considered.



L.	Time-limit is shorter than ever before.  But Trib. wd. say ground has bn. fully traversed so recently.

		

								[Exit L.B.

		4.	Central African Federation.



Sw.	Afr. Affairs Board proposed in W.Paper wd. have power to consider wthr. any legn. etc. discriminates unfairly v. Africans &amp; to recommend Govr. Genl. to reserve approval of any legn. wh. does so to the S of S.

	Those powers must stand.  But objn. raised is tht. this Bd. is extra Parly. &amp; tht. the powers shd. be exercised by elected people.  To meet this it is now suggd. tht. 6 African members (2 fr. each territory, 1 black one white – with a Chairman) of Parlt. shd. constitute the African Affairs Bd. as Select Cttee. of the House.



	Advantages	i) If you are to choose best repves. of S. Afr. interests, 		those elected for that purpose wd. be best repves.

			ii) Good men are scarce : Govr. mght. not find them.

			iii) With this duty alone, separate Bd. wd. not have 			enough to do.

			iv) Might be in conflict with the repves. in Parlt.

			v) Elected men will be in closer contact with Parly. work 		etc.



	Do not favour adding outside members as well.

	Can defend this on merits as improvement on original plans not as concession to S. Rhodesian pressure.



O.L.	Our opponents will extol advantages of outside body not subject to political pressures.



		Agreed.



		5.	Procedure.



A.E.	One mtg. a week during Recess - ? on Wednesdays at 11 am.
