C.C. 29(53)				28th April, 1953.



	1.	Foreign Affairs.	[Enter  L.B., B.H., S.Ll.



P.M.	Molotov’s offer of 5 Power mtg. (incldg. China).  Wd. have 

		preferred 3 – takg. on from Potsdam.  May be imposs. to

		refuse : but risk tht. large gathering wd. degenerate to U.N.

		level.

	M.’s statement looks as tho’ he was aiming at a general pact of peace.

		“Easement” is the most we can hope for.



S.Ll.	This plan has bn. put fwd. by R. in U.N. – associated with ⅓rd. cut in

		armaments.



P.M.	U.S. won’t sit in with Comm. China.

	I wd. much prefer to wait.  Wish Eisenhower hadn’t started this off

		by making his speech.



S.Ll.	Need for interim guidance (in F.A. debate) to smaller countries of 

		West.  Bidault’s speech, suggestg. disarmament confce., wasn’t

		helpful.  Useful to enunciate our attitude to Europe – before we 

		get involved in discn. of a b’down in Eg. negotns.  This is 

		argument for holding F.A. debate next week, not earlier.



Sal.	Alternative to early debate mght. be statement on M.’s offer.



H.M.	Wd. magnify its importce. : it was only reply to a “front” organn.



H.C.	Parly. situation – better to have F.A. debate next week because 

		Floods Bill, not ready that wk., wd. be ready in followg. wk.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	If no debate on F.A., wd. take C. Afr. Fedn Bill on one of the days.

	Thurs:  2nd. Rdg. of Finance Bill.





	3.	London Transport Enquiry.



L.B.	Answer shd. be given before municipal elections.  There is a good 

		case on merits : but expedient to get it out soon.

	H.A. Cttee. agreed there shd. be enquiry.

	Cd. announce to-day, in reply to P.Q.’s from our side.

	Must exclude charges because Tribunal.



O.L.	Delete “if any” -  Agreed.







	Transport Bill.



P.M.	Congratns. to M/T. on admirable manner in wh. he has handled Bill.

		Excellent Parly. performance.

				[Enter  G.Ll., O.P., D.S.



	4.	N. Ireland:  Unemployment.



M.F.	No scope for further orders.

	Ques. comes down to this : if N. Ireland propose coal subsidy in 

		Budget we can remit £¾M. fr. Imp. contn.



R.A.B.	(Not heard.)



G.Ll.	Sc. and N.W. England will ask for same concessions on coal subsidy.



Ch.	Wd. help flourishing industries as well as depressed.



H.C.	Other areas haven’t same percentage of unemplt.



J.S.	But there wd. be strong pressure fr. H. &amp; Islands.



P.M.	R.A.B. supports M.F. on gift to N. Ireland Govt (reduction of Imperial

	 contribn.).

		Let them come over &amp; discuss with us most convenient

		way of using it.  Coal subsidy wd. be awkward.  Dress up

		the minor remedies as much as possible.



O.P.	No remission of employers N.H.I. contns.



P.M.	Cab. were opposed to that.



D.S.	Ann. A. para. 4. (c.141) – more textile orders.  £300.000 work on

		making up &amp; 400 emplt.  Wd. like authy. to go on with that

		at once.



			Agreed.



W.	Why are they behind in executing orders?



D.S.	We order fr. small no. of firms &amp; they have other business.

	This order wd. be outside W.O. apprd. estimates.		[Exit  L.B.



R.A.B.	I will consider to-day &amp; inform M/S.





	5.	Atomic Energy Organisation.



P.M.	Propose to add 2 sentences to announcemt. appd by Cabinet.



R.A.B.	Agree.     



D.S.	Don’t. 



			After discussion – agreed in amended form.





	6.	Civil Service : Regional Organisation.



R.A.B.	No need for Reading or Cambridge.  No interference with e.g. B’ham.



W.M.	Local offices supervised from Regions.  If those H.Q. were abolished

		I wd. have to establish a second office in Ldn., wh. wd. be more

		expensive.



H.M.	Support that view.  Essential need for close contracts with l.a.’s on

		Housing : secured tho’ Regions.  Also need for close co-opn. in

		Regions betwn. local officers of M/L. and M/W.  Dpts. quarrel

		less in Regions that in W’hall.

	Try to put N’castle area under Leeds &amp; see what a row you will raise.



L.	We cd. do this – tho’ Leeds wd. raise diffies.



O.P.	So cd. we.



P.T.	Accept much of H.M.’s view : but if staff economies are to be secured

		we must cut on Regions.  Accept proposals.



J.T.	Admy. accept:  but not N’castle.



D.S.	Wd. cause us some diffy., but wd. fall in with a general decision.

	Joint organn. with B/T : no objn in principle, but want opportunity

		to consider practical details.



R.A.B.	Will consider in light of discn.



P.M.	M’while any practical steps wh. can be taken shd. not

		be delayed – tho’ not announced.

			                                                   [Exit  G.Ll., O.P., J.T., D.E. 



	7.	Meeting of N. Atlantic Council.



R.A.B.	a)	No relaxn. of defence effort : v. healthy.

	b)	U.S. in private mtgs. with us &amp; Fr. warned us tht. little defence

			aid will be included in future Budgets.  For us it will be 

			nothg. but off-shore procuremt.  Means slight redn in dollar

			b/p. in first year and a lot more after June ’54.  I therefore

			said officially tht. we accepted ’53 targets &amp; ’54 targets

			only on assumptn. of U.S. aid &amp; satisfaction re German

			contn.

		Promise report later on effects on b/p.

	c)	Free-er trade.  Clear they won’t move an inch for some time 

			ahead.  Can rely on nothg.  Joseph Dam : H. said he

			hoped we wd. get the contract.

		Oil.  Don‘t like H.’s plan : want to tell him so.  U.S. Cos. to take

			over purchase of A.I.O.C. oil.

		Clear tht. U.S. Admn. are involved in deep Republican

			controversy - &amp; will be so for a year at least.

						[Exit  D.S.



	8.	Housing Policy.



H.C.	Hopeless to pass both Rent Bills this Session.  Advise therefore

		Rating Bill this Session &amp; whole Housing Policy early next

		session (para. 4).

	Wd. avoid this year’s local elections.

	Wd. get public opinion behind it – starting at Tory Confce.



Sw.	V. bad to open Rents before we have whole housing plan.

		W’hold W. Paper until new Session opens.



P.M.	Leakage in Fin. Times.



Sw.	V. mild one.  Also in S. Times.



R.A.B.	City worried re below/line expenditure.  Major problem for us now.

		Also because of Paris I shall have to look closer at b/p.

		Shall have to discuss with H.M. means of preventg. houses going

		above 300.000 target.  Commitments for educn., agric. etc.

		Also cement &amp; timber imports.

	Wd. have liked, for confidence in £, to have the Rent Bill this session.



H.M.	Support H.C.’s plan.  Sorry we can’t do this Bill now, but agree it’s

		not on in present temper of Parlt.

	Draft W. Paper is ready.  Will go to Cttee.

	When we hit target of 300.000, I’m ready to talk sense.  Sink to

		240.000 or so &amp; put balance into repairs.





	9.	Commonwealth Affairs.



	i)	India.



Sw.	Circulatg. N.’s answer to my rebuke on his speech.  Satisf., so far as

		it goes.



	ii)	South Africa.



Sw.	Malan is registering vigorous protest v. speech by Cantuar – who

		spoke of “slavery” in S. Afr.  He mght. object to sitting with

		Cantuar in W’minster at Coronn.



P.M.	Reprove Cantuar – who wd. be well advised to stick to spiritual

		matters.





	10.	Parliament : Reform of H/Commons.



P.M.	Consider alterns. of procedure wh. wd. make M.P.’s life tolerable –

		and get Opposn. to accept them in return for increased salaries.

		?  A Cttee of H/C.
