C.C. 1 (54)					7th January, 1954



148.	    Four Power Meeting.				[Enter B-C., B.H.



A.E.	Dulles has suggd. 3 Power Mtg. before Berlin starts :  esp. on tactics.

In touch with Adenauer :  that will be O.K.

	Suggests Paris on Sat./Sun. before the mgt:  going straight on to Berlin

Suggests bringing A. then, too.  That wd. certainly be a mistake:  we agree with him on policy &amp; he isn’t concerned with tactics.

	I have suggd. we arrive in Berlin a little earlier.  Our High Comms. cd. be there.  Fr. have now said they agree it (D.’s plan) wd. be a mistake.



P.M.	D’s plan looks as tho’ he wants to spoil the Mtg.





1.	    Middle East Defence.  Pakistan/Turkey.



P.M.	Surely an unwise move now.  Doesn’t add to our strength :  does provoke R.  Surely he shd. be told so, plainly.



A.E.	Turks are too cautious to go headlong into this.



P.M.	Worst possible moment to start this idea up.



Sw.	It’s now all over U.S. Press.



A.E.	Shd. I add to my 48?



P.M.	Add refce. to untimeliness vis-à-vis F. Power Mtg.



			Agreed



A.E.	He has had in mind for months.  



Sal. 	Mentioned it when I was in W’ton.



A.E	I cd. also tell Amb. in Ankara to speak to Turks, takg. initiative.

Have told him what he shd. say if they approach him.



P.M.	Don’t object to plan per se :  I am pro-Turk.  It’s the timing.

We cd. join in later, if it went well – dispensing with Egypt.

	Damaging criticism here if we appeared to have had some responsibility for brk-down of 4 Power Mtg wh. (right or wrong) has created such hopes.



Al.	Don’t put them off showg. interest in M/E.  Don’t therefore criticise the plan itself.



Sw.	Can’t overtake publicity already given in U.S. Press.

	Bound to excite Nehru. – esp. as we &amp; they have assured him on basis tht. there is no ques of a Pact only aid to Pakistan.



P.M.	We can’t lose :  if they go on, it makes a new grouping northward of E.  Cd. be fitted into re-deploymt. plan.



A.E.	What do we say to Turks.?



P.M.	Tell them we aren’t averse to plan, but doubt wisdom of timing.





1.	Egypt :  Sterling Balances &amp; Defence Negotiations.



P.T.	Delay has had healthy effect. They offer, in effect, to ease up on their import restns.  Shd. we not tell our Amb. to get a deal on this.



P.M.	Not yet.  Keep all cards in our hands.  Climax is coming in negotns.



A.E.    	x|  Tel Amb. to find out what they propose re relaxns. &amp; report to Ldn.

             	  |  We can &amp; shd. leave the £10M. unpaid m’while.



Sw.	Caffery too has bn. holding firm language.



A.E.	In answer to U.S. request, we can set out what we want:  not a statement of views of both sides.  Can do this shortly on main items.



P.M.	Supreme prize wd. be a really satisf. agreemt. with E. – a loyal &amp; friendly Treaty.  But a mouldy one, with a dying base, is no good.



A.E.	Outlined main points in new memo.



P.M.	What about Sudan?



A.E.	Howe has had one show-down &amp; has won.  Commn. is sound by 3:2.  They may try, by vote in Parlt, to move good Sudanese off the Commn.  We must find means of preventing that.

	Turkey.  Mil. convns. re  base in Turkey at Mardin with ref. to defence of Iraq.  Nr. Turkey/Iraq/Persia frontier.  Agreemt. to that wd. fit in with northward redeployment and U.S. plan for Turkey/Pakistan.  Iraq wd. like it : wd. ease burden on Hibbanyah.



P.T.	Can we do x/?



P.M.	No hurry.  Want E. to feel tht. all kinds of pressure are coming on them.

	Some things gain by being dealt with at leisure.





      	[    4.	Uganda.



O.L.	Uganda have offered him £8.000 pa,

	He wants a little more &amp; some capital. ]





1.	    Sale of Arms Abroad.		              [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers, 

152)	    C.A.S., D.S., Maudling

153)	

Sw.	 U.S. will give mil. aid to Pak. in some form.  India wd. greatly resent our refusing their demands wh. are in themselves quite reasonable.  They wd. buy elsewhere. B. traders in India wd. suffer.  Wd. ease out takg. off-shore dollars for Pakistan’s needs.



D.S.	V.gt. advantage to us in m’taining war potential.  Our 4 tank factories are running v. light :  2 might have to close unless we get more orders.  This wd. transform posn.



A.H.	Support this.



P.M.	Must m’tain broad parity of treatment for I and P.



J.T.	We cd. find a cruiser for Pakn. – to balance the one sold to India.





	Argentine &amp; Chile.



P.M.	We had a war with them last year. [“Please see that the fruits of this war are not cast away as were those of the last two.”]



O.L.	Govr. Falklands think it wd. make little difference in practice.

	But I’m not fond of it.



P.M.	Wd. be v. awkward if it were said tht. they were using equipment bought from us.



D.S.	It’s U.S. type made here.  They have some already.  Won’t make much diffce. if they get some more from us.

	Big drive to sell aircraft to A. &amp; C. against U.S. competn.  W’holding these will make that the more difficult.



A.E.	Thght that we have delayed so long tht. A. won’t now take them.

May be safe therefore to offer them.

	Peron has told us he doesn’t mean to establ. any base in Antarctica this year.



P.M.	We cd. offer the helicopters v. a promise not to make any lawless move there.



O.L.	Cd. we not move twds. exploratory conversns. re claims in Antarctica.

P.M.	Only if you keep it on basis of reference to Hague.



A.E.	I will consider wtr I can make a propn.





	Brazil



P.M.	No harm in disposing of this example of an obsolescent weapon.



J.T.	Don’t accept your premise.  But we can’t afford to complete it.



			Agreed.

			                                             [Exit 3 Serv Mins, C.N.S., D.S.

					[Enter G.Ll.

1.	    Persia.

153)	

A.E.	Wright has now seen Zahedi.  Clear tht. A.I.O.C. can’t return, as such &amp; alone.  But they accept survey of Abadon by party incldg. AIOC men.

	We shall need to go fwd. on basis of memo.

	May I have genl. approval for consortium &amp; genl. approach in memo.  Shall see Fraser on Tuesd.

	Hope AIOC wd. get 50% interest in consortium :  &amp; wd. also be paid by the others for what she conceded.  Also compensn. to be made in free oil.

	Buraimi may work out similarly.  New find [there] wh. may be as rich as Kuwait in disputed area btwn. Trucial Sheikh &amp; Saudi.  Found by I.P.C. – consortium of same kind.  Hope to arrange with U.S. concessionaire tht. I.P.C. shall develop; and we shall be 45% in. We cd. prob. get Saudi agreemt. They wd. like to get us as well as U.S. into Saudi.  But Sheikh won’t want Saudi to have any share.

	This makes me readier to give U.S. a share in Persia.

	Shd. Int. Bank play a part?  Persia may want it.

	Also resumptn. of Persian oil will involve U.S. Cos. in cutting down their prodn. elsewhere.

					[Enter Watk.



1.	    Industrial Disputes.

154)	

Engineering.



W.	Both sides have accepted Ct. of Enquiry.  unions will give evce. &amp; p’pone ban until after report.  Victory for right-wing leaders.

	Electric contractors.  V. small no. (35,000)   Was a 2 wk strike last year, w’out effect on natl. economy.  But v. little hope of stopping this recalcitrant Union &amp; stupid employer.



P.M.	Not an unsatisf. position.

	They may begin to understand risk of pricing themselves out of export markets.





1.	    Remuneration of Judges.

155)	

B.H.	Feeling in H/C. re retired pay is so strong tht. we cdn’t get 2nd. Rdg. at present time.



B.C.	Letter from a no. of M.P’s supports that view.



A.E.	At mtg. difference was accepted by most.



P.M.	Don’t like suggn. of blackmail.



Sim.	How long a postponement?
