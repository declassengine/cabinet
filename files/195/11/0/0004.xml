C.C. 104(52)							12th December, 1952



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter Sw., B.H.



H.C.	Storm over plan to take Hire Purchase Order after genl. debate on Tues. on Kenya.  Shall we trim?



B.H.	Dangerous to persist.  All-night sitting. 1922 Cttee. restive.  Pairing is in chaos, &amp; we have many sick.



	1)  Either leave Order over until after Recess &amp; resume one day earlier.



	2)  Or sit on Friday all day : Order until 4 p.m. : adjournment until 10.0.



	3) Or sit on Sat. until 4 p.m. for Xmas adjournment.

	Opposn. likely to prefer 2).



P.M.	Why must we get Order before Recess.



R.A.B.	Announced it in Finance Bill – successive pressures to drop it – can’t forego sources of revenue.  Order operates fr. Mon. : better to debate it quickly.  Trade oppose &amp; obstruct.  Concessions or apparent weakness will encourage revolt by other trades.



P.M.	Can’t keep H/C. all night for this.

	Must not prejudice Transport Bill.  Can’t push that thro’ plus an all-night sitting on Order.



B.H.	Method 2) will involve closure at 4 p.m.



R.A.B.	P’ponemt. until after recess will increase trade pressure for concession.



J.S.	Offer Opposn. choice betwn. 2) and 3) ?



P.M.	Prefer to p’pone until after recess.

	Don’t like 2) or 3) because people will have planned to be away on Friday.

	Assure R.A.B. of our determn. to push it thro’ immed. after recess.

	Get agreement with Opposn. on that basis.

	If they won’t settle for quiet finish on that basis, offer them choice of 2) or 3).  Of those I wd. prefer 3) : offer that first.



	Kenya debate.  H.M. to reply.			[Exit B.H.











		2.	U.S. and Canadian Loans.



R.A.B.	Pay.  Bad start for C.E.C. approach to U.S. if we asked for waiver.

	Anyhow we can’t satisfy 3rd condn.

	Take up revision of conditions in genl. talks with U.S.  And, if we can, get provn. for paymt. back retrospectively.

	Even if we pay, reserves at end/year will be 1,800.



P.M.	Agree.



O.L.	Favour paying.  But doubt wthr. we shd. whine publicly about it.



P.M.	Pay : but look proud about it.

							[Enter Serv. Ministers.



		3.	Service Pensions.



Al.	O.K. on scheme &amp; will announce before Xmas.

	On other ques. do we turn down or promise considn.



R.A.B.	Repercussions, if we yield are endless.

	Adjournment debate : can we stand on main scheme &amp; say v. little on the other.

	Don’t be quick to promise considn. in terms too encouraging.



M.F.	V. gt. feeling on this ques. generally.



P.M.	Say it’s under considn. but raises v. grave issues affectg. wide nos. of people.



R.A.B.	Language to be agreed with Ty.
