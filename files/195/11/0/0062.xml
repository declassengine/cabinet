C.C. 57 (53)					13th October, 1953



89.	    Three Power Meeting.			            [Enter B-H

90)	

A.E.	Invited Dulles &amp; Bidault to come to Ldn. for discn. of current internatl. problems.  Both have accepted.  Will arrive Thurs. – for talks Fri., Sat. &amp; if necessary Sunday.  Present as continn. of W’ton talks (U.S. wish).  Announcement this p.m.





1.	    Four Power Meeting.

91)	

A.E	Want Adenauer to see this before 3 Power Mtg. in Ldn.

	Draft agreed betw. U.S., U.K. &amp; Fr. officials.



Sal.	Para. 6.  4th. sentence suggests our reply wd. differ fr. U.S. – because they haven’t agreed to form of conference. 



A.E.	Will check.  Believe U.S. have agreed to this formula.



H.M.	Does it tie U.S. too tightly to their present attitude.



A.E.	Will consider this again.





1.	    Egypt.

92)	

A.E	Robertson’s Ch. of St. will be here to-morrow to report.  A further mtg with Egyptians arranged for Saty.

	One good thing secured is good draft re Suez Canal.  This will satisfy our critics.

	Availability is main snag.  “If in light of genl. sitn. either party consider according of such facilities as essential to the safety of the M/E.”  might do instead.  E. might prefer it.



Sal.	Might not cover attack on Greece.



A.E.	That wd. imperil M/East.



P.M.	Spin it out until we have bn. able to speak to 1922 Cttee.



A.E.	May need Cab. decisions on Thursday – for the Saty mtg.





1.	    Trieste.

93)	

A.E	Tito’s reaction has bn. v. violent.  Dulles had a talk with T’s F.Secy. y’day, wh. went quite well.  Hang on pro. tem.  Send no reply to his request for 5 Power mtg : wd. concern only security not merits : wd. look weak to acquiesce.

	Shall tell T. this is no worse than he was ready to accept years ago.

	Weakness of our case is tht. we haven’t publicly said we think this shd. be final.  Will try to push D. further on this.

	Soviet move is clever, but T. unlikely to fall for it.

	Shan’t connect item 1 Mtg. with Trieste ques.

	If we had done nothing, situation wd. certainly have got worse.

		Cab. authy. to rebuke Y. for insults in Belgrade.





1.	    British Guiana.

94)	

O.L.	Fairly quiet.  Govr. fears incendiarism.  But no sign of it on a serious scale.

	We didn’t act for fear of Comm. coup, as some Press say : but to secure law &amp; order while Comm. Ministers were removed.

	Present W. Paper Tues. p.m. – announce that in reply to P.Q. &amp; say no more until debate on Thursday.  Cd. submit W. Paper to P.M. and if necessary Cab. on Monday.

	Jagan : have told him to see H.H. first, who will be there on 19/10.  Then will consider wtr J. shd. be received here.



P.M.	Don’t mind his coming here.  Will be seen that Comm. pet him – and that will alienate Labour sympathy for him.

	But I wdn’t receive him while present circs. continue – as dismissed Minister.



O.L.	Saw Tewson y’day :  suggd. he shd. nominate one of 3 members of Commn. of Enquiry.  He deprecated treatment by certain section’s of the Press – presumably Reynolds News.  T.U.C. concern is mainly with Jagan’s proposed ordinance giving power to M/L. to determine which Unions be recognised.  Nor do they like contacts with W.F.T.U.





1.	    Regional Organisation.					[Exit D.E.



R.A.B.	Must do this if we mean business re C. Serv. numbers.  As in memo.



W.M.	Wd. like to try to reduce nos., keeping only those needed for industrial relations and filling labour vacancies.  Controller, &amp; his contacts with industry, is valuable.  I will go into it personally.

		Staff in 2 Regions totals 85.



H.M.	Sorry to disagree.  Do we want Reg. Organn.  Or are we merely altering its H.Q.  One of defects of C. Serv. is tht. they don’t see public.  In Regions they do.  Value of personal contacts in housing work.



P.M.	Can’t officials visit from Ldn.



R.A.B.	Wd. save 300 staff.



H.M.	Is it proposed to transfer Reg. H.Q. to Ldn., or to abolish it?

	Am planning to free private bldg, subject to Reg. control of starts.

That can’t be done fr. W’hall.  Will need co-opn. betwn. M/H, M/L and M/W in Regions.



W.M.  }	In 9 other Regions status quo will continue.  It is essential to modern

R.A.B.}	work



H.M.	If it’s clear tht. Reg. structure remains, I am prepared to move Reg. HQ. from Reading &amp; Cambridge to London:  provided they aren’t merged in M/H H.Q.



Sal.	Two principles i) economy ii) de-centralisation.  Don’t, as Tories, abandon ii) Wd. play Socialist game.



D.E.	We built Reg. bldg in Cambridge.  Shan’t be able to get rid of it &amp; shall have to rent accommn. in Ldn.

	M/W. must keep local offices in Camb. &amp; Reading.  M’tenance Staff too.

		Let R.A.B. discuss with M/H., M/L and M/W. location of these. Regional staffs, w’out prejudice to Reg. structure.

		And report to Cabinet.





1.	Food Prices and Subsidies.				[Exit DE.

				           [Enter I.McL

P.M.	V. serious.



R.A.B.	Can’t allow them to rise after announcing reduction.

	Propose we get down to rate of £220M. by end/year.  Then we need only do beef, butter, cheese &amp; milk.  There wd. be a higher figure for year’s trading, but I wdn’t seek to recoup that in next year’s a/c’s.  This wd. mean increase of only .63 in c/living index. 



P.M.	Right that people shd. pay proper price for food they eat.  But they needn’t be asked to pay cost of pol. bargains made with Br. Farmers.



Ll.G.	Accept R.A.B.’s solution – tho’ may be trouble over milk.

	P.M. is right in stressing point tht. these subsidies are now mainly to Br. farmers, not consumers.  Difft. method of recouping farmers must be found after de-control.  Good that country shd. know that.



P.M.	It is an act of State to support Br. agriculture.



W.M.	Bread was the most serious fr. my angle.  But even the rest will make wage negotn. v. difficult.

	Price is limiting exports.  Wage increases wd. make it worse.

	Employers as well as workers fear increases in food prices.

	.63 wd. raise us fr. 140 to 141.  Wd. be quite serious.



R.A.B.	It is balance of advantage.  I believe we must adhere to what we said on subsidies.



W.	Disadvantage in coming by-elections.



J.S.	Put 1/2 of  it on now &amp; balance later?



Ll.G.	Related to de-control of butter &amp; cheese.  Will have to rise then.



W.M.	Nov. is critical for me.  Staggering wd. help.



Ll.G.	.18 vice .36.  Is it worth it?

		Wage rates have risen more than food this year.

cf. increased expenditure on sweets £60M. over last year and £90M. over year before.  Mostly in W. class area.

	Don’t want to keep on raising butter prices by successive bites.



P.M.	Evil things do at once : good things, spread them out. A Machiavellian principle.



P.T.	Support R.A.B.  Can’t afford to be too frightened of c/living.

Must go on with policy of reducing food subsidies.

			

P.M.  	{ Accept R.A.B.’s plan in principle.  £220 rate by end of year.

	{ Consider dates – to meet W.M’s position.

		Cheese is more awkward than butter for me.



					[Exit I.McL.

1.	    Cotton.



W.	Commn. lost £27M. last year.  Trying to save Exch. money.

Trade want it stopped.

	Discussed with trade for last 6 mos.  They are ready to assume respons., but must be able to hedge thro’ futures market.

	Commn. serves only 44% of total consumptn. – &amp; less next year.

	Govt. scheme will soon break down.  Those running it now are looking for jobs in the trade because scheme has no future.  Sir. R. Lacey has bn. holding it together &amp; has now resigned.  We can’t continue to run it efficiently.  I don’t want to take responsibility for it.

	But it may cost £11M. on b/payments.		[Exit A.E.

	There is a dollar risk : but stress §7 of memo.



P.M.	Politically v. attractive.

	If it is imposs. to defer it for a year, we shd. consider it v. seriously.



R.A.B.	Only just holding b/p. posn. :  aren’t bldg. up a surplus.

	Wd. prefer to p’pone.  Don’t want to get into posn. in wh. we can’t control purchases if U.S. recession.  Softwood will be a drain. £50/60M. loss fr. de-liberalisation in other ways.



W.	Possible risk of £11M. i) But who will gamble in cotton at 30d. p. lb. No-one will be a bull at that price.  ii) Also Lpl. Exchange can control speculative transns., selling overseas for dollars.

		iii) Tho’ they wd. need complete freedom in 1st. year, in later years they cd. put brake on purchase of U.S. cotton.

	Why put it off for a year when Govt. Commn. lose £27M. p.a. – and have no longer confidence in themselves.

	We are using public money to cover risks of private buyers.  Not good policy.



RAB.	U.S. recession is starting.  Don’t want to abandon dollar controls at this point.



Sal.	A.E. is anxious about that.  Also that U.S. cotton might be bought vice Brazilian so tht. Brazil cdn’t clear her debts to us.

		But wd. accept those risks if it can’t be p’poned for a year.



W.	Trade tell me they wd. want to go on buying Col. cotton because it is so good.



P.M.	Dramatic feature in our theme – higgle of market gives greatest benefit to the people.  And prominent in our Election campaign.



O.L.	Risk is not so great.  If there is a U.S. recession, it will bring down price of U.S. cotton.



R.A.B.	Convertibility of commodities with non-convertible currency &amp; inadequate reserves.



M.F.	Impressed, in Lpl., by expert to wh. trade have weighed diffies. before promising they will do it.  If opportunity is w’held, there is real risk tht. firms will at last lose heart.



R.A.B.	Let W. have one further look. to see if it can go on for 12 mos.



P.T.	We can’t hold this Govt.  Commn. for another year.  It will collapse.



H.M.	This is not so dangerous in recession as some imports.  You don’t buy cotton unless you think you can sell it again – not like films or tobacco.



			Agreed : Go ahead.





1.	    University Suffrage.

98)	

P.M.	Not worth fighting for fancy franchise on so small a basis.
