C.C. 4(53)							22nd January, 1953



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter B.H., G.H., L.B.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Friday : Sunday Observance Bill.  Free vote : no Govt. guidance.



M.F.	Much feeling on both sides in favour of enquiry – because of sports etc. 



	Will prepare memo. and send to some Ministers – to see wthr. there is a case for enquiry.  This Bill wd. legalise professional sport as well as theatres, &amp; that goes too far.



Sw.	Diffy. is tht. on report of an enquiry, Govt. wd. have to act.



B.H.	Better to hope tht. this Bill wd. be lost on 2nd Rdg.



H.M.	Likely to be lost because it goes too far, as M.F. says.



H.C.	Diff. to get an enquiry on its legs – members wd. expect tht. no Govt. wd. touch it.



A.E.	Easiest solution wd. be for it to be lost.



H.C.	Debate (Tuesday) on Credit for Argentine – Spokesman : Ec. Secy., Ty.; unless the debate goes wider.  We can’t control character of debate.



A.E.	Wd. it be preferable to let it be known we are ready to have wider debate in followg. week on Argentine agreement.  Ec. Secy. &amp; M/F. to speak.



R.A.B.	Or offer to have it wide on Tuesday.  It will run until 10 pm.



B.H.	Prob. can arrange that.





		2.	Royal Title.



M.F.	Asked Opposn. to agree – non-controversial, little time &amp; start in H/L.

	They have accepted first &amp; second, but don’t want it to start in H/L.

	It is true tht. in 1927 both Bills started in H/L.



H.C.	Arguable both ways.  Tiresome that Opposn. shd. dictate to us on this.

	Awkward also to leave it lying around after introduction.



B.H.	Cd. meet them on starting in H/C. in return for agreement to pass in a day.



A.E.	I promised W.Paper “shortly”.

							[Enter Watk., D.S.



		3.	Nationalised Industries : Pensions for Board Members.



R.A.B.	Memo. can’t cover all cases.  Exceptions can be discussed with R.A.B. &amp; L. 



	Reasonable general policy.



L.R.	Civil Avn. and applies only to 2 Chairman.  Cd. bring them in administratively pro. tem. and tuck a statutory provision into some Civil Aviation Bill w’in next 2 yrs.



Watk.	Suppl. pensions scheme for manual workers expected in Jan.

	Publicity for this might prejudice that.



L.	No special or general publicity will be given to it.



D.S.	Best that can be devised.  But don’t like 10 year qualification – wh. will mean tht. people who aren’t up to the job will be kept on in order to earn his pension.   



L.  	Cdn’t justify lower limit.

							[Exit L.B.



		4.	Miners’ Wages.



L.	N.U.M. seeking to exclude younger men, as not deserving increase – in order to cover wider range of older men.  Want to extend to all day-workers.

	Wd. mean another £2¼-£2½ m.  This wd. look weak &amp; wd. provoke another round.  Eg. rlwaymen working alongside.

	N.U.M. more disposed to encourage Sat. work &amp; more helpful than before.

	But that element in N.U.M. don’t control Wales and Scotland.

	N.C.B. showing some signs of weakening : Houldsworth wd. like to give way.



G.H.	Because he argues tht. he wd. by this means get right wing of miners with him.



Sim.	Houldsworth will stand firm if Govt. encourage him to do so.



G.H.	Wants to be sure miners won’t get more by coming to Govt. behind his back.

	Repercussions on prices – mentioned.



D.S.	I’m already being pressed to increase steel prices.  Resisting it temporarily because of assocn. with selling the industry back.

								[Exit Watk., G.H.

		5.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Appln. comes to Cttee. on 2/2.

	Two groups of problem – i) get Japan into internatl. organisations.

				     ii) find means of accommodatg. J. competn. 			         wh. will be more intense because of her 			         loss of old markets in Asia.



	Admn. of J. wd. give her m.f.n. treatment : &amp; any who resolved to raise tariffs v. J. wd. have to raise them v. all.  Genl. increase in tariff barriers wd. be contrary to general policy for expanding world trade.

	Paras.6 of paper &amp; 17 of memo. sets out our solution – best we can devise.

	Recommend we try for that.  Austr. and textile producg. countries (eg. France) might support us.



A.E.	V. unhappy about this. We are really seeking to discriminate v. Japan – at a time when U.S. are trying to build her up as sole anti. Commun. bulwark in F/E.  Most other countries will dislike our approach. J. of course will – &amp; we are about to negotiate paymts. agreemt. with J.

	This, however, seems best way to start.  Rumour tht. U.S. might prefer waiving of no new pref. rule v. Japan only.



              x/	Unlikely to succeed : certain to arouse opposn.



R.A.B.	Discuss with Canada &amp; U.S. first.  If their objn. is violent, seek an alternative method – eg. on no new pref. lines.

	Agree with A.E. on x/.

	Safer to explore this with Canada &amp; U.S. first.



P.T.	Start with all members of Cttee. likely to be friendly. French are likely to support us.  U.S. will be among these.



Sw.	Inform all Doms. even tho’ not all are on Cttee.



R.A.B.	Still prefer to speak to U.S. first of all, because of talks followg. C.E.C.



R.A.B.	Unwise to exclude J. imports to Colonies on b/p. grounds.  That isn’t consistent with our line in payments negotiations.  Am writing to B/T. on this.



	R.A.B. and P.T. to consult together.

 

	Saunders:



A.E.	Offer to release in exchange for Chin. woman captured in Malaya. &amp; under death sentence.

	She has appealed to Pr. Council.

	Can she be released pending appeal.



O.L.	No adv. in executg. even Ch. women.

	Avoid this by trading her away.



Sim.	No reason for not takg. her outside jurisdn. of appeal Ct. by prerog. of mercy.



M.F.	Solrs. wd. w’draw appeal.



O.L.	I shall have to press Sultan of Perak to exercise gnt. of mercy.  Also to square Templer.
