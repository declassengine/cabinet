C.C. 22(53).				24th March, 1953.



	1.	Judges’ Salaries.	[Enter  B-H.



P.M.	16 members of Executive of 1922 Cttee. were unanimous v. Bill.

		4 declared they cd. not vote for it.  They don’t challenge

		principle:  they are at a loss re method.

	Diffy. of method of gross salary – cartoon in D. Herald.

	Impressed by complaint about being rushed.  Too short an 

		interval betwn. introdn. and 2nd. Rdg.  Clear now that delay is 

		only course to take.  Decided therefore to p’pone until after

		Easter.  Announced last night because it began to leak – either

		thro’ 1922 or Labour Whips.



H.C.	Read statement to be made in H/C. this p.m.

	ShD. we declare support for principle of some increase in 

		remuneration or the increase declared in Bill?



J.S.	By a difft. method unlikely to secure same as the £1.000.



O.L.	Introduce the words “approximate equivalent”.



P.M.	Inclined to favour “expenses” method, if Bill can’t be put across.

		My priorities are i) Bill method  ii) expenses w’out detailed

		proof.



			Agreed.   “Increase in remuneration of the order

			                 [proposed] in Bill.”





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Adjournment Thursday:  there will be P.Q.’s.



			                                      [Enter  3 Serv. Ministers &amp; Solr.G.

	3.	Amnesty for Deserters.



P.M.	Why not burn their lrs. and ignore posn.



M.F.	Don’t dissent from that.  But must avoid saying tht. Executive will

		dictate to prosecutg. authies. wtr. they shd. prosecute or not.

		cf. Campbell case.

	If we follow (3) in M/D. memo:  I cd. consult Police &amp; other 

		prosecutg. authies. on civil offences &amp; get them to say tht. a man

		with cert. of transfer to reserve wd. not ordinarily be prosecuted

		for any civil consequential offence.







P.M.	Then you encourage another class to write in &amp; be forgiven – extends 

		classes.

	You avoid interference with prosecutg. authies. by burning the

	evidence.



Al.	Won’t be believed if police pick him up later &amp; prosecute.

	300 out of 1.500.  No solution is ideal.  Favour course 3);  but we shd.

		have to say at once no more wd. be forgiven for further mistakes.

		Otherwise those who deserted post-war wd. try to angle for same

		benefit.



A.H.	Favour course (3).  But make it clear tht. no more writing in now will

		be let off.



P.M.	Gives premium to those who were foolish enough to write.

	Burn letters.



Sw.	No:  when man has written he will prob. have taken other steps which

		give him away – e.g. call at Food Office.



Solr.G.	3) extends the amnesty.  Why not say confessn. will be taken into a/c

		as mitigation but each case will be considered on merits.



Al.	There is no perfect solution:  choice of evils.



A.H.	Yes 3) is least evil.



Sim.	Disregard of lrs. wd. get you into other difficulties.



P.M.	Let us have report by Cttee.  L.P. (Chair), M.D., M.F.,

	att.G., or Solr.G. with Service Ministers in attendance.

	Let them also consider:  i) those who deserted pre-war &amp;

	served in war thereafter.  ii) those who served will in 

	war &amp; deserted after.

	Cttee. to complete in time for announcemt. Mon. next.

					      [Exit  Solr.G.

					      [Enter  B-C.

	4.	Officers’ Retired Pay.



Al.	Much feeling in Parlt.  Won’t be dropped.  Causes much antagonism

		among good Tory supporters.  Grave hardship among these

		senior officers.  V. small cost.  Diminishing commitment

		because old men.

	Believe this small concession wd. satisfy them for some time.



B-C.	Stabilised above the then c/living figure.

	Ch/Ex. feels v. gt. diffy. because effect on higher pensions.  Same was

		done for senior C. Servants – who equally are restive at present

		rates.



Ch.	That wd. also be a diminishing commitment.



B-C.	Wd. involve raising higher levels of pension for first time.



W.	Cd. make a case for warriors wh. wdn’t apply to C. Servants etc.,



B-C.	On the cut they were treated exactly same as C. Servants.



Ch.	Shd. we not get figures &amp; see what is involved.



P.M.	After Judges am shy of taking up case of the Generals.



A.H.	This (restricted to a few senior officers) wdn’t silence the clamour

		in H/C.



L.	(Asked) favoured M/D. proposal.



H.C.	You won’t hold it on this alone.  We shd. examine repercussions first.

		If it opens flood-gates it’s millions

	     {	Defer decision until R.A.B. returns.

	     {	Ty. to put in memo. on nos. cut in same way at same time.



					[Exit  3 Serv. Min.

					[Enter  D.E.

	5.	Historic Houses.



Sal.	Spk. fr. special knowledge – Nat. Trust, Georgian Group &amp; Chairman

		of informal group of owners of most important historic houses.

		Can spk. for them tho’ haven’t consulted them.

	Co-opn. of owners is essential to success of Bill.

	Think of posn. of man who inherits :  he can’t pull it down, or sell it : 

		told it’s his duty to m’tain it : yet he is crushed by taxn.  Is it

		unreasonable tht. he shd. be left enough of his own money to do

		his duty.

	He will be suspicious of grants – wh. lead to acquisition.  This feeling

		not confined to house-owners : it’s shared  by C/E, who have 

		rejected Govt. help for this reason.  Proposal re houses 

		requisitioned in war : tht. Govt. shd. take over houses on wh. they

		had spent certain propn. of money.

	Told Bill is designed for unoccupied houses.  These are not the ones

		we shd. preserve.  Even Labour Party recognise tht. it’s the

		occupied houses wh. we shd. cherish – even foreigners want to 

		see them.  Tourist traffic is important : asked to keep Hatfield

		open in winter on that a/c.  Not houses “elegantly embalmed”

		by M/W.

	Bill is dangerous in principle &amp; ineffective in practice.

	Non-controversial : yes because it adopts opponents’ plan.

	Must record my protest v. it.



Sim.	Diffy. we faced.  To do Gowers. plan involved much more money than

		Ty. will spend.  Cost of covering all designated houses, by tax

		relief or grant, wd. run into millions.  This Bill has a different

		object.



Sal.	Don’t ask for Gowers.  Ask for no more houses to be assisted than 

		Ty. propose.



Sim.	Wd. that money go v. far on your line?



Sal.	Cd. spend a bit more to get a worth-while return.



Al.	Is tourist traffic bringing in £115 M. p.a.



Sal.	Owners won’t co-operate on this basis.  Cheaper to aid owners.

		Montacute – dead now, since turned into museum.



B.C.	Some owners cdn’t m’tain even with assistance.



D.E.	Some good houses are coming into market.  We cd. buy &amp; m’tain.

	Others are not owned by people who incomes aren’t enough

		even with tax reliefs.  Others wdn’t do what architects wanted.

	If money won’t cover whole job, we shd. make it go as far as it can.

		Give it only where needed.  Tax relief wd. give most where it 

		was least needed.  Grants wd. be negotiated voluntarily.

	Tax relief method wd. be controversial w’in Tory Party.



Sal.	I contemplate no more than allowance for tax purposes     [Enter  H.M.

		for specified approved maintenance.



P.M.	L.C.’s Cttee. went into all this &amp; they support the limited scheme.

		Formidable opinions.



M.F.	Mistake to prevent salvage operation merely because we can’t do

		somethg. better.



H.C.	Will never be able to do more than this.



Sw.	This Bill will concentrate available money on small no. of houses

		&amp; un-inhabited ones.



P.M.	Fear Cttee’s concln. must be accepted.

		But this may not be the end of it.  Public educn. may continue.



			                                                       [Exit  B.C., B.H.

			                                                       [Enter  P.M.G. &amp; Nutting

	6.	Royal Cypher.



J.S.	Arms vice cypher.  All Govt. bldgs. &amp; property.



W.	Throughout U.K.  Wd. save expense.  Don’t have to alter.



P.M.G.	Concessions will spread – stamps : special ones for Scotland,

		Wales etc.



P.M.	Do nothing.  Use up G.R. boxes.  Catch culprits.



M.F.	Announce acceptance of “highest numeral” &amp; face it out.  Wd take

		away much of the sting.



P.M.	New bldgs : wise to avoid use of cypher.	[Exit  P.M.G., D.E.
