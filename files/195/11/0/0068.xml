C.C. 63(53).				5th November, 1953.



	1.	Atomic Energy Organisation.	[Enter  B-H.



P.M.	I can’t be respons. for defending transfer.



H.C.	Only suggested tht. your name shd. be on Wh. Paper.  You aren’t 

		asked to make a statement.

	Draft O-in-C. comes to Legn. Cttee. to-morrow.  May be debate on that.

		M’while, nothing need be said save in reply to P.Q.’s.



P.M.	L.P.S. can answer ques impromptu on procedure, m’while.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Mon :	1st. Opposn. amendmt. – agriculture.  M/Ag. will speak 

			second.

	Tues :   2nd    ..            ..       on c/living &amp; o.a. pensioners.  M/F. will

		   speak.  L.P.S. to reply – as it is end of Debate.

	Business for remainder of week.





	3.	Industrial Disputes :  Engineering Industry.



W.M.	Employers are to-day giving refusal.  May be some strikes.  Unions

		will consider their posn. next week.  They may try ban on 

		overtime;  or they may put it up to me.





	4.	Television Policy.                                 [Enter  P.M.G., H.Amory.

			                                                     [Exit  Ll.G.



P.M.G.	Main features i)  effective control thro’ publ. corpn. ownership of 

		stations.  Corpn. can more easily remove licence fr. operating

		company.

			    ii)  no sponsoring.  Operating cos. won’t be connected

		with advertisers.  Advts. will be separate fr. p’mmes, wtr they

		are spot advts. or documentaries.

	Means of affording 2nd. p’mme, financed by advts., w’out loss of 

		quality.

	Halifax, tho’ wishing we had left it alone, will not be v. hostile.

	Religion and politics need not be excluded.  Controls applicable to

		B.B.C. can be applied thro’ new corpn.



H.C.	Nuisance for M.P.’s.  Doubles the demand – on Ministers and

		Members.



P.M.G.	No claim : Parties wd. have it in their own hands.  They cd. agree

		to patronise only B.B.C. if they chose.



R.A.B.	Party wd. welcome this – want to break “monopoly of mind”.

		But nuisance value will be v. great.

		Palace, like Parties, will have to give equal facilities to both.

	I wd. favour keeping it out of this at outset.



PMG.	We shd. be charged with compelling new cos. to concentrate on 

		light entertainment.

	Palace:  no oblign. to give time to competing commercial cos.  Corpn.

		won’t b’cast.



M-F.	Politicians must learn to do t.v.



P.M.	You will be forced to admit it, in the end.  Keep it in reserve, as

		something to give away.



J.S.	No harm in letting religion in.  Believe we shall have to admit 

		politics too.



H.M.	Main thing :  brains trusts etc.,  Can’t rule that out.



P.M.	Nor Ministers &amp; M.P.’s.  Party leaders must limit it.



Sal.	V. few who are good at it.  Heavy blow to B.B.C. if you double the

		amount of time available : best people will be bribed away

		fr. B.B.C.



W.M.	As opportunities increase, more people will become good at it.



 Sim.	You can’t define what you seek to include.



P.M.	Can’t keep them off :  better therefore to admit them under proper

		control.  But not sure we hadn’t better leave it to free vote.



B-H.	Jay’s P.Q.  Say :  “wait until we see Wh. Paper”.

			General view :    Whips on Wh. Paper.

			                         { Free vote on religion &amp; politics.



W.	Cd. exclusion be limited to religious services &amp; Party pol. b’casts?



Sal.	Include it because we can’t see how you draw the line – but invite

		H/C. to decide &amp; if they vote for exclusion we will see how 

		you can do it.



R.A.B.	Examine initial charter of B.B.C., wh. excludes controversial

		pol. b’casting.



P.M.	Don’t like this thing at all.  Want a few vote, to see it voted down.



R.A.B.	Wd. anger back-bench supporters of sponsorship.



P.M.	They have no right to compel other back-benchers to vote 

		v. their conscience.



R.A.B.	V. strong feeling at Margate in favour.



PMG.	And we have gone far to commit ourselves m’while.



P.M.	Morally wrong to use the Whips in these circumstances.

		V. worried about it.



			Agreed :  (2)  RAB &amp; PMG. to consider phrasing on

			                       religion and politics.  (You won’t be able to

			                       exclude:  must at least allow free vote 

			                       on that.)

			                (1)  Approve Wh. Paper, save para. 10.

			                (3)  Reserve ques of free vote.

				[Enter  D.S., G.Ll.

				            Solr.Genl.

				[Exit PMG., H Amory.

	5.	House of Lords Reform.



Sal.	May Cttee. continue – and may I consult repve. Peers.



P.M.	You won’t get agremt. on a fancy H/L.  And you may, by trying,

		weaken a structure wh. wd. otherwise creak on usefully for

		generations.

	If you make any change, Socialists wd. sweep it away.

		…. creaking, but nevertheless magnificent &amp; ancient, institn.



Sal.	36% of Members come 10 times p.a.  And attendance is decreasing.

		If we leave it alone, it won’t creak on.  When older generation

		dies out, you may have completely effete H/L. in 10 or 20 years.

	Let Cttee. at least go on trying.



P.M.	H/L. is now v. popular – as it wasn’t.  But dangerous to bring it into

		acute controversy.



			Agreed :  Cttee. to continue its work.		[Exit  D.S.





	6.	Trade Conferences Abroad.



P.T.	As in memo.

	Either  i)   w’draw opposn. to attendance.  Most trade with R. will then

			    be channelled thro’ this organn.

		   ii)  say this is Comm. organn. &amp; deprecate attendance.

	A.E. &amp; I support (ii).



RAB.	So do I.

			Agreed.



	7.	Coal Production.



G.Ll.	As in memo.  Cab. shd. know we are getting this fr. Poland.
