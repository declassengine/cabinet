C.C. 50(53).				25th August, 1953.



	1.	Kenya.                         [Enter  3 Serv. Ministers, H.H., V.C.I.G.S.



H.H.	Genl. surrender policy doesn’t affect need for re-inforcements –

		indeed, it increases it. 

	First sign of a break in M.M. front.

	Disorders in s. province of Nyasaland.

	1 Battn. K.R.R. due to go to Malaya.



A.H.	Lack of br. H.Q. wd. reduce effectiveness of 2 Battns.

	Addns. to E.’s staff wdn’t give same result.  His opns. involve gt. 

		dispersion of forces &amp; decentralised control.  Distances are too

		great for centralised control by E.

	Brig. H.Q. = 100 in all.



P.M.          x/	Assent to despatch of 2 Battns.  Will discuss with A.H. need for 

		H.Q. staff afterwards.



R.A.B.	Addn. to overseas expendre – for K. will prob. not be able to pay.

		But don’t dissent.



A.H. 	Shall have to make prelimy. move wh. will disclose intent.  Favour 

	announcemt. tht. re-inforcements are being sent: announce on 

	28/8   (C.O.)           Agreed. 



			Agreed as at x/.	[Exit  V.C.I.G.S.





	2.	N.A.T.O. Military Planning.



Sal.	As in memo.



RAB.	Support.  But seek consultn thro’ officials on wording of § 6(c).



A.H.	1953 Review:  for ’56:  diff. to assess effects of new weapons.  May be

		troops planned are excessive.



Sw.	Consultn. with old Doms. after talks with U.S.



de L.	Para. 6(c) is almost too specific.



P.M.	No.

			Approved.



P.M.	Later:  let e.g. Monty give some of us apprecn. of N.A.T.O.

			      mil. dispositions.





	3.	Germany : Reply to Soviet Note.



Sal.	Accept Fr. draft “in 1st. instance electns., but need not preclude discn.

		of wider issues….”  Best we shall get.

	Phrase disliked by P.M. has bn. left out.

P.M.	Publn. before G. election?



Sal.	Adenauer prefers that.  Publn. 5/9 (after delivery 4/9) : voting 6/9.



H.M.         (i)	Diffce. of principle betwn. this &amp; our original text.

		P.3 of tel.  “At same time shd. be willing to join in genl. world

		review.”  Now limited to G.  Goes further away fr. P.M.’s speech

		of 11/5.

                 (ii)	G.  Para. 4.  Cd. we omit “even” in last sentence.



Sal.	Ready to accept (ii).

	On (i) posn. easier because 2nd. S. note was confined to G.  And W’ton

		decns were so confined.



RAB.       x/	Cd. we add to § 4  “as part of a genl. settlement”.



Sal.	Ambiguous.  Shd. be asked wtr we meant G. or world settlement.

		Cdn’t say latter w’out denying W’ton decision limitg it to G.

		Also wd. widen issues – re-admit ques of Ch. repn.



H.M.	We want talks – wtr fruitful or not.  Not sure U.S. or Fr. do.



Sal.	Shan’t get others to accept anything implying wider talks.

		This is best we shall get.

	On home politics, people do now expect these talks to be limited to G.



P.M.	At least ask for addition of x/.



Sal.	I will try.  Prs. “as a step towards a genl. settlement.”





	4.	Persia.



Sal.	Z. is in control – tho’ sporadic diffies. in provinces.

	Comm. coup wd. have followed in2/3 days – &amp; Z. has not rounded up

		all Comm. leaders.

	Shah has re-affirmed oil natn. &amp; said too early to restore dipl. relns.

	with U.K.

	Spontaneous up-rising – loyalty to Shah, dislike of M.

	New Govt. unlikely to diverge fr. nationalist policies.

	To our interest tht. this Govt. shd. survive – Commn. is now only

	alternative.

		Soln. of oil ques is therefore v. urgent.  Shd. therefore hope for 

		renewed dipl. relns.

	Immediate need of Z. will be for money.  U.S. will offer.  Hope we can

		join in – pref. with short-term rehabilitn. loan.  Quick offer on

		that, coupled with approach on oil.



P.M.	I suggested that to R.A.B. – w’out getting any encouragement.

		He wd. sooner see U.S. do it.  Pity if they collared all our

		long-estd. posn. in P. for a small sum down.  Big stakes for us.

		Cdn’t we do somethg. jointly with U.S. – to preserve

		Anglo-U.S. approach.



R.A.B.    	i)	Cd. be repaid only in oil.

               	ii)	Don’t want to prejudice our case on compensn. for oil natn.

               	iii)	A.I.O.C. are doing v. well w’out Persian oil : don’t much want it

			flowing again.

               	iv)	Always refusing developmt. money, even to Doms.  Awkward to

			give it to P. after all she has done.

	At least, resume dipl. relns. first.  Find out what U.S. intend.

		Any help shd. be linked with promise of better treatment over oil.



P.M.	We lose £60 M. p.a. because loss of Abadan?



R.A.B.	It did initially.  But we have offset by developing other resources.



P.M.	Political advantages of a loan shd. be kept in mind.



Sal.	Shall I ascertain U.S. intentions?



H.M.	On iii) Co. won’t want anyone else to get benefit of P. oil

	Cdn’t we buy some oil : 50% to go to P. and 50% to compensn. fund.

		That was Ch./Truman proposal.



Sal.	Have asked Cttee. to review Anglo/U.S. plan &amp; any alternatives giving

		rather more to P.



P.M.	V. small loan new mght bring v. large benefits.



			Agreed : Sal. with R.A.B. to ascertain U.S. intentions.





	5.	



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





	6.	Egypt.



Sal.	Seems quite possible tht. we shall get our plan on duration, but not

		expressed as nominally a 10 year agreement.  Not 2.000 for

		final period:  but consultn. re nos. in that period.

	Re-activation formula may be accepted too – save consultn. only in

		event of attack on T.  Tho’ attack on T. wd. involve, because 

		number of NATO, major war and use of base wd. therefore

		be secured under other half of formula.

	Wish to re-affirm we will go as far as Cab. authorised previously.



P.M.	H. &amp; Robertson have done v. well.



A.H.	Need to start w’out delay installations elsewhere if we are to be out in 

		18 mos.



P.M.	Not before agreemt. is concluded.

			                                                [Exit  3 Serv. Ministers,  H.H.



	[7.]	Duke of Windsor.



P.M.	We prs. cd. prevent or delay official publicn.  But said tht. pp.

		are also in other hands.  If they leaked, posn. might be worse if

		it were said tht. we had tried to stop it.



M-F.	Irrelevant to history of war or G. foreign policy.  Against publn.



P.M.	Miss L. has bn. working up feeling among her U.S. collaborators.

	Bidault hasn’t replied.

	wd. like to try for delay – 10/15 years.

	Don’t believe D/W. cd. come to U.K. if these were published.

	B.’brook wd. have tried to buy any in private hands.  But he believes

		tht. if we try to stop publn. and fail we shall enhance their

		importance.



Sal.	Strong arguments on both sides.  First re-action was v. publn.

		Now I have read them : also know tht. several copies are about :

		wd. be worse if we tried &amp; failed to prevent publn.

	D/W. comes out pretty well.  Flattered into thinking he cd. help twds

		negotiated peace – that is worst that appears.

	Saw Miss L.  She is not so doctrinaire as P.M. suggests.  She has 

		suggested Weimar Republic pp. might be publd. ahead of these –

		thus evading diffy. of intervention by U.K. Govt. Wd. take at least

		5 years to get these published.



P.M.	That wd. be satisfy.  Wd. mean that issue wdn’t arise.



H.C.	Try to p’pone until after death of D/W.  The other protagonists are

		dead already.



Sal.	Wd. like P.M. to see Miss L.



P.M.	If they had to be published, W.M. cd. write report on his mission

		showing pressures on D/W.



W.M.	Wd. like to write such a report anyway.

		Agreed   {  Better to delay publn.

			      {  P.M. to see Miss L.

			      {  W.M. to prepare report.

		If we can’t avoid publicn., we will publish an a/c of

			our side of the affair.

		If it has to be published, D/W. must be told in advance.





	7.	Match Monopoly.



P.T.	Manufacture is in hands of B. Match – a monopoly.  They have 

		agreemt. dividing markets with Swedish Match.  Commn.

		concluded tht. this operates v. national interest.  But their

		recommns. were v. much less firm.  Price control is impracticable.

	We must choose betw. partnership &amp; competn. with Swedes.  If we

		choose partnership we must approve market-sharing agreemt.

		If the other, we shall prob. damage B. match-making interests

		abroad.

	Won’t affect price of matches.  But public will treat it as a test case.



M-F.	Tory Party favours competn. v. monopoly.  Must, on principle, break

		the agreement.



RAB.	½M. loss on b/p:  affects relns. with Can. &amp; Sweden : leads to request

		for tariff protectn.  But follow Tory principles.



H.M.	When you can’t compete, it’s wise to accept offer of half the business.



P.M.	Can you not sacrifice too much for a principle.



H.C.	This is the first clear case of monopoly - &amp; we are commd. to hilt

		politically to smash monopolies.



			Agreed:   Break the monopoly.



R.A.B.	Reserve my posn. on appln. for a tariff.





	8.	Tariff Policy:  “No-new Preference” Rule.



P.T.	We have agreed to negotiate ourselves out of this agreement.

	U.S. have now promised to support appln. on basis in para. 2.

	Warning re second part of memo. on “bound” items.



RAB.	Trouble in H/C. over apples, pears &amp; dried peas.

	But we can’t get anything better.





	9.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Oppose J.’s accession – detrimental economically &amp; politically.

	Even if we abstain, J. may get this.  But A., N.Z. &amp; S.A. wd. side

		with us.

	Sal.’s memo. stresses provisional assocn.  But even GATT is only

		provisional.  Don’t like voting for assocn. &amp; reservg. right to

		walk out later.  We shdn’t walk out, for pol. reasons:  we shd.

		have to rely on XXIII safeguards.



Sal.	Wiser to allow assocn. on basis tht. if in fact competn. damages us we

		reserve freedom to end it quoad U.K.  We shd. be on stronger

		ground then.



P.M.	But it’s clear tht. because living standards they will damage us.



R.A.B.	Shall we succeed in P.T.’s plan?

	If provl. assocn. is inevitable, &amp; Doms. think so too,  wd. be better

		not to oppose but to rely on XXIII and XXXV.  That wd. be more

		effective than opposn.  J. is bound to come back into w. trade &amp;

		if we oppose them fr. outset they will sabotage our trade.



Sw.	Support P.T.

	We cdn’t follow Sal.’s course, unless A &amp; N.Z. agreed in advance.

		For if they raised tariffs v. J. they wd. have to raise them v. us.

		V. diff. to get their agreemt. to F.O. plan.

	If J. accedes, she gets all m.f.n. advantages while giving nil. in

		return.  We had give &amp; take.



RAB.	Tel. 127 fr. Geneva says Comm. view is diff. to resist.  Bound to fail.



P.T.	But even if J. does get in, we shan’t be commd. to the assocn.



H.C.	Support P.T. – if provisional agreemt. doesn’t cover us &amp; we can 

		rely on XXXV from outset.



H.M.	Support P.T.



M-F.	So do I.



W.M.	And I.



R.A.B.	Defin. disapproval of this short-sighted policy. O.L. approved 

		Sal.’s memo.

			Agreed :  Follow course proposed by B/T.



Sal.	If Doms. won’t follow this line?



Sw.	If they accept F.O. line &amp; give assurance they won’t raise tariffs v. us,

		that wd. be a new situation.  But I don’t believe it will arise.



P.T.	I shall be there in person.  Shall watch attitude of Doms.

		But even if they went other way I wd. still have to consider

		U.K. political posn.





	10.	Atomic Energy Organisation.



H.C.	Outstanding point has bn. settled.  Indicated basis of agreement.





	11.	Guided Missiles.



P.M.	Enquire what consultns. were made before recent announcement

		was made.





	12.	Date of Next Meeting.



	Tuesday, Sept. 8th.
