C.C. 61(53).				27th October, 1953.





	1.	Trieste.		[Enter  B-H.



A.E.	Worked out proposals to put to Y. and I.

	Mallet now think I. wd. accept divn. on Zones.  Y., however, are in

		mood to raise their bid – now say they will march if any part

		of adminn. in Zone A is handed over.  Told F. Maclean he will

		be reasonable at confce. :  but can’t get I. there if he puts 

		pre-condns. too high.

	Fr. are interceding with Y.

	Suppose they accept confce. :  transfer civil admn. in Trieste itself to I,

		before confce. meets (Y. ought to accept that, but fear they 

		won’t).





	2.	Oil Strike.



W.M.	Strike is ended.



M-F.	Thanks to troops.  Avoid statement in H/C.  Do it thro’ orders, on 

		return to camp.           Agreed.



P.M.	Let me have a note of cost – actual &amp; loss of prodn.



				[Enter  D.S., G.Ll.

	3.	Atomic Energy Organisation.



	i)	White Paper.

Ch.	Add new para. – after para. 14.	Agreed.



R.A.B.	Cd. we omit para. 18. of Annex?



Ch.	Waverley’s words:  can’t change them.  Ty. will have control over 

		Bd. members.



R.A.B.	Cd. we consult Waverley – e.g. compare vice compete.

		Wd. do this to-day in consultn. with Cherwell.



D.S.	Don’t want any doubt re my views.  Don’t think this is a wise plan.

		Good in theory :  but v. little diffce. in practice for many years

		because v. close control.  No harm on civil use.  On weapons,

		serious  mistake to blur Min. responsibility, as betw. Ld. Prs.

		&amp; M/Supply.  Welcome new para. 15.  Wd. like to discuss terms

		with Ch.



	ii)	Time-table.

D.S.	Avoid 2 debates.  Avoid any debate before scheme worked out in

		detail.  Some ques still in doubt e.g. wtr. legn. shd. precede

		

		establmt. of Compn. : may be better to set it up informally 

		first and see how it goes.



Ch.	Much speculation.  Shd. make ourselves clear &amp; our intentions.  Urge

		early publn. of W. Paper.



H.M.	Who will introduce Bill in H/C.



Ch.	L.P. wd. decide – prs. L.P.S.



	iii)	Queen’s Speech.

P.M.	Don’t want to be commd. to a Bill so far ahead, when it isn’t drafted.

		We haven’t even decided wtr. legn. will be necessary (?)

		Keep something in hand.



P.M.	{  Present White Paper.

	{  Decide Ministerial responsibility in H/C.

	{  Don’t promise legn. in Speech.



D.S.	Prefer to delay W. Paper – until O-in-C. details are known.



Ch.	They are known.  O-in-C. is ready.



RAB.	Must be laid in Nov. – to make transfer on 1/1.  Must lie for 40 days.



D.S.	Why transfer functions unless you are ready to set up Corpn.  Wait.

	Tho’, if it can be decided soon, I wd. favour early announcement –

		incldg. promise of legn.



Ch.	Lay O-in-C. in Nov. and take debate on that.



H.M.	Bill won’t be ready until Feb.  Isn’t that a reason for delay.



H.C.	If transfer on 1/1 and O-in-C. on Nov. 8, debate will be on O-in-C.

	Alternative :  to wait – means continuing uncertainty &amp; confusion

		among those concerned.

	Must publish W. Paper if you mean to produce O-in-C. on 8/11.



Ch.	Necessary to make Govt. intentions plain, w’out further delay.



H.M.	Publish W. Paper this Session.

	No reference in Speech.

	Lay O-in-C. on 8/11 &amp; take debate on that.



H.C.	In that event why not mention it speech?



P.M.	Leave open ques of legn.



Ch.	Legn. will be necessary.



R.A.B.	Mention in speech.  (Legn. will be necessary.)

		Present wh. Paper – on 8/11, with O-in-C.

		Debate on Order-in-Council.



	Agreed.	Get on with prepn. of Bill, for introdn. in 

			     New Year acc. to L.P.S. decn.





	4.	Decontrol of Meat &amp; Bacon.	[Exit  D.S. &amp; G.Ll.



P.M.	Plan of M/F. appeals to me because it accords with theme of Govt.

		policy – decontrol, free market, end of State trading etc.,

		We have also to m’tain agric. prodn.  But a subsidy shd. suffice

		for that &amp; is provided in M/F. plan thro’ deficiency payments.

		Ty. is bound to support Br. agriculture.  Deficiency paymts &amp;

		buttress is surely an adequ. guarantee to farmers.

	Don’t determine this by refce. to votes.  Doesn’t follow that farmers

		will vote v. us because we don’t do just what F. Unions demand.

		Voting strength of any interest, however powerful, shd. not

		influence our decisions.  We must not be afraid to do what is

		right.



T.D.	Agree re votes.  I’m concerned about farmers’ confidence in Govt.

		Not a ques of money, but of principle.

	My plan :  attempt to meet farmers’ views &amp; get M/F. out of business.

	Situation changed last month.  They didn’t press for monopoly Bd.

		They asked for …….  (Plan in App.I.)  Cdn’t accept their plan.

		Can’t promise they wd. accept mine.  But is there any diffy. in 

		mine?  They provide for restn. of private trade.  Will give free

		choice to butcher &amp; consumer.  Safeguards for farmers.

		Safeguards for Ty. as good as those under M/F. plan.  Will

		serve needs of M. marketing &amp; encourage creatn. of M. Boards.

	Must have decision in principle in support of producer M. Boards.

	Many of us are deeply committed to that principle.  That is principal

		wh. is cardinal to recovery of farmers’ confidence.  They doubt

		our attitude twds. M. Bds.  Bds. are not Govt. dirn. :  producers’ 

		own.  And ample safeguards to consumer.

	Our 1st. moves into freedom have alarmed farmers – because of 1918.

		We have said it won’t happen again.  But cereals (on their hands)

		alarm them.  On meat, they fear being handed back to butchers.

		Know tht. this is farmers, not Unions.  Ring’s etc.,

	Admit farmers don’t know about buttress price feature.  But they fear

		def. paymts. in principle.  Equiv. beasts will sell for diff. prices,

		&amp; they won’t have that, even with def. paymts.

	Time factor – can’t guarantee mid ’55, but wd. hope to achieve it.



J.S.	Not heard.



Ll.G.	Pledged to return businesses to meat traders.  Also to restore

		consumer choice.  And to guarantee market &amp; fair prices

		to farmers.

	My plan does not exclude M. Bds.

	It fulfils 2 condns.  Restores pre-war function to meat traders.

		Fulfils guarantee to farmers.

	Alternative – monopoly M. Bd. &amp; State trading m’while by M/F,

		who will buy at fixed price &amp; sell in free market.  No control

		over timing, quality &amp; quantity :  &amp; will have to sell to trade 

		with right to refuse what it doesn’t want.  Bad commercial propn.

		Trades bitterly opposed :  no incentive to reduce Govt. loss.

		And greater loss, greater Ty. assistce. to new Bd. – so producers’

		incentive wd. be to make Govt. lose more.

		M/F. wd. have to control imports &amp; continue bulk buying.

	No guarantee tht. M.B.d. wd. be created by ’55.  V. long procedure.

		Doubtful if it wd. be ready by ’55.  If farmers then turned it

		down M/F. wd. still exist.  And then we’ll be near Electn.

		We shd. be trading in meat, at heavy loss :  &amp; M/Ag. scheme

		wd. be supported 100% by Socialists.  When they were 

		thinkg. of natn. of meat, this was their plan.  Monopoly Bd. is

		a long step twds. natn.  See para. 10 of my memo.



T.D.	M/F. plan does prejudice M. Bds.  We have advocated monopoly

		powers for M. Bds.  Do we adhere to that?



P.M.	Our policy is to approach free working of supply &amp; demand as 

		nearly as possible.  Add protection for the weak – by subsidy.

	Farmers have no right to dictate method, so long as their security

		is assured.

	Let public pay thro’ taxes anything tht. has to be paid to farmers.

		And restore freedom as betwn. butchers and customers.



W.	Difference betwn. Ministers is not on principle but on method.

	We gave firm promises to meat-traders in ’40 – just as firm as

		those to farmers.

	Policy – to discontinue State trading.  Inconsistent to perpetuate it

		on meat.

	M/Ag. plan.  Monopoly Bd.  M/F. auctioning to butchers.

		Don’t want to dragoon every farmer into monopoly producers’

		Board.  That is a Socialist system.  And if you force it you will 

		split Party.  Don’t allow more than a voluntary M. Bd. – in

		future, after study.



R.A.B.	Party posn. is not so bad as M/Ag. suggests.  In Agric. Charter we

		said tht. M. Bds. mght operate voluntarily or compulsorily.

		But wdn’t say anything firm on that to farmers now.

	On merits M/Ag. has tried to make sense of farmers’ scheme, wh.

		won’t work.  But his scheme tries too much – est. comp. 

		M. Bd. in trade involvg. £3M. at mercy of market.  And I am

		asked to finance it, regardless of market – and a subsidy in 

		addn. to cover losses.  Unsound financially :  stinks of monopoly.

		Cdn’t w’stand criticism now, still less in 3 years or so.

	Right scheme, economically, is deficiency paymts. &amp; buttress price.

		In summer we all agreed on it.  Supports individual farmer. 

		Reduces admn.  because it means registering, only deals below 

		a fixed average price.

	That plan has never bn. put to farmers.  They are in diff. mood

		objectg. to anything incldg. word “deficiency”.  But cd. we

		add provn bringing farmers in, with M/F., to consider future

		marketing policy?  Wd. that be a sop to them? (para. 3 of

	x/	App. to Food memo.)  Call it Marketing Council?  In meat

		(tho’ not milk) the eventual Soln. won’t be, I think, a 

		monopoly M. Bd.

	Choice:  adopt M/F. plan &amp; negotiate it with farmers plus x/ or hold

		an enquiry.

	Enquiry wd. have to avoid prejudice to farmers’ aims.  Wd. mean we 

	shd. have to go on as now for 12 months : fixed prices etc., 

	Wd. allow public opinion to play on problem.



P.M. 	Enquiry wd. imply Govt. inability to frame a policy.  Confession of

		failure.



A.E.	Never known farmers more disturbed than now.

		“No one is entitled to security” (P.M.)  But that is just what

		they were given by Socialist Act of 1947.

	Butchers’ rings etc.,  Exaggerated, but fear is real.

	Enquiry wd. look as tho’ we hadn’t a policy.

	Can’t we see wtr we cd. influence farmers with buttress price.

		Don’t confront them with it.  Popular with towns but wd. 

		affront farmers.

	Take M/F. plan.  See wtr it cd. be adjusted in any way to placate

		farmers.  See also how best to present it.



B-H.	Tory supporters in H/C. are strongly opposed to def. paymts. 



M-F.	Govt. N.I. favour M/Ag. plan.

	For myself, much impressed by diffies. – in 2nd. half of M/F. plan.

	Buttress price :  how do you apply § 5 of Act of ’47.  Don’t

		understand how it will work.



P.M.	Agree [in principle] tht. policy be framed on basis of

		M/F. plan.  See how it can be adjusted to meet farmers &amp;

		how it can best be presented to farmers &amp; Tory Party.



	R.A.B.’s Cttee., with others, to work it out &amp; present to Cab. on 

	Thurs. or Friday.  Meet S prs. to-day.





	5.	Trade with Europe:  Liberalisation.



R.A.B.	E.P.C. agreed to liberalise up to 75%.  Involves freeing softwoods –

		but shan’t announce that, or any specific commodity, yet.

	Shall also have to raise tourist allowce. to £50 – cost £2M.

		For that is stat. minimum under OEEC (?) rules.







	6.	Tariff Policy : G.A.T.T.



	Note taken of report in C(53) 300.
