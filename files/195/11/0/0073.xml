C.C. 68 (53)				                                                         19th November, 1953



121.	    Parliament.

					[Enter B-H.

H.C.	Business for next week.

	Judges :  2nd. Rdg. in week following.

	Opposn. want F.A. debate on 30/11 before departure for B’muda.  Unreasonble. since D/Address so recent.  Might therefore offer 1/2 a day this week.   (P.M.  No : wd. sooner do it on eve of departure).

		Agreed:  try for [none or] 1/2 day on 30/11.

	Opposn. don’t want Housing Bill 2nd. Rdg.  before Xmas.  We had intended 30/11 and 1/12.  Don’t propose to give way on that.

			                            [Later :  Opposn. agrees to no F.A. debate.



1.	    Television. 



P.M.	Television.  Wait &amp; see what happens, in H/Lords.



W.	Cd. not have persuaded them to defer.  They want to defeat our plan.

123)	

R.A.B.	Most undesirable tht. H/L. shd. get ahead of H/C.  Salisb. shd. try to get it deferred.  Our party in H/C. feel v. strongly :  &amp; if these Tory Peers try to lead, we shall have a clash on it.



Sim.	Can Salisb. move them fr. what they think a tactical move.	

					[Exit M-F.



B-H.	If defeated in H/L., pressure will come for free vote in H/C.

With a Whip, we cd. get it thro’ in H/C.  Only 1 would insist on abstaining.





1.	    Meat Rationing.



Ll.G.	Must keep stocks, so long as there is rationing.  Ought therefore to reduce ration before Xmas :  if we don’t shall prob. have to make a sharper redn. in Jan.

	If we seek increased supplies, it will cost dollars (Can. or U.S.) or risk foot &amp; mouth (France).



W.	Cd. you not eliminate free element &amp; leave ration unchanged.

Then add a Xmas bonus.



Ll.G.	Wd. increase risk of redn. in Jan.



W.	The “free” goes to the richer people.  Better to cut that first.



Ll.G.	Will consider that solution.

					[Enter G.Ll. and I.McL.

1.	    Fog.



H.M.	It’s the small things that cause pol. trouble.

	Two courses. i) play it down ii) boost it up.

	Someone needed to grip it because several Dpts. are concerned.



J.S.	Shd. we not see Beaver Rpt. first.  Announce when Rpt. has bn. seen.



R.A.B.	Let us look at Rpt. before we decide.  Season of fog is passing.



G.Ll.	Report includes some practical suggns. for immedte. action.  Study those first.



A.E.	Yes :  &amp; be in posn. to announce immediate decisions.



I.M.	Publicity is now on decrease.  Pity to revive it.



H.M.	Cd. Ministers named first meet to consider draft Rpt.

And advise Cab. what is best course to follow.

Delay report until week after next.

			                                                             [Exit G.Ll. &amp; I.M.

			                                                            [Enter de L., J.T., O.P.



1.	    Retired Pay of Service Officers.



Al.	8 P.Q.’s in H/C. 24/11.  Motion (Jeffries) in H/L.  Round robin from Members.  Sixth discn. in Cab. this year.  Much trouble ahead of us.



P.M.	Ty. fears repercussions which might cost £400,000.



Al.	Can distinguish betw. Service officers &amp; civil servnts.



J.T.	Pressure for this comes from all Parties, including Socialists.



Al.	I will take 10% if I can’t get anything better.  Tho’ it doesn’t restore the 91/2% cut!  I wd. prefer to restore the cut for Service Officers only.



R.A.B.	Cdn’t resist claims of C.S. pensioners, who have bn. stirred up by the Service Officer agitation.

	If it cd. be held there, it wd. be only £200,000 		[Re-enter M-F.

and diminishing.



Sim.	Logically, it cd. be held there.



A.E.	But not politically. I agree with R.A.B. on that.



P.M.	This opens a most dangerous door, on its most creaking hinge (because it benefits only the senior people).



Al.	Do the right thing &amp; resist the repercussions.



O.L.	We have no answer to the officers’ claim.



O.P.	Before next election shall have to make increases to o.a.p. &amp; war pensioners.  Easier to right this then.



P.M.	V. damaging attacks if we benefit richer only.



R.A.B.	Wait until we have seen C.S. deputn. to Ministers on Monday.

	Consider also minor concession’s to B. Legionaries.



			Agreed :  Resume on Tuesday.

					[Exit J.T. O.P.



1.	    Jordan.



A.E.	We have told Israel (Apl.) tht. we intended to put in a brigade.

They won’t therefore be surprised now at a squadron.  But it gives us a chance to give warning re Treaty.

	Problem is what we say to Jordan.  Alternatives in para. 4.

	U.S./U.K./Fr. agreemt. on resoln. on Quibya shd. reduce temperature.



CIGS	Gt. strat. adv. in havg. armd. brig. group in J. in peace – well-placed in reln. to where they wd. have to fight in war, &amp; wd. stiffen Arab Legion.

	We wd. like it long-term.  But it wd. be too expensive in quarters etc., in near future.

	Prefer therefore to do no more than a squadron for stiffening &amp; build it up in mid-term to a regiment.

	Para. 5 of memo.  “Assist in re-deploymt” fr. E.  Won’t affect it actually.  No accommn. in Libya :  wd. have to come home.

	If we had to re-inforce for Arab/Jew war, wd. take a month to send what was needed viz., inf. brigade group + armd. regm.



A.E.	This suggests that para 4(i) is enough pro. tem.



CIGS.	Yes :  training for benefit of Arab Legion – stiffen them.



A.E.	Won’t provoke I.  Might prevent J. fr. asking us what we mean to do about Treaty.

	Maan is well s. of potential danger area.



P.M.	No need to mention Treaty to I?



A.E.	Must do so :  can’t risk their deducing tht. we don’t mean to honour it.  This is what deters them.

			Agreed :  Para. 4(i).

					[Exit de.L.

					[Enter Att.G.

1.	    Uganda.



O.L.	Govr. – Cohen :  left-sympathiser : clever.

	Kabaka – unstable socially (living with his sister-in-law).

	Drastic step of deposing him shd. not be taken w’out bringing him home for a dressing-down.  But, if he persists. shall send him home &amp; be deposed there.  He is a weak man &amp; there’s a good chance tht. he will collapse here.

	He has lost face with his people because of his matrimonial troubles.



P.M.	Our honour is involved in allowg. him to return.  No repetition of The Seretse trick.



O.L.	There will be trouble if he is disposed.  But more if we allow this to drift along.



H.C.	C.R.O. fear tht. this will upset Africans in C. Afr. Fedn.

	Is there any scope for giving him rather less than independence?



O.L.	No.  Developmt. lies in unity of Uganda.  And progress wd. involve more repve. instns. &amp; less dynastic rule.



P.M.	Decn. 	1) Bring him home for pie. Law.

			2) Don’t prevent him fr. returning.

			3) Authy. to depose in Uganda if 1) fails.

					[Exit A.E., Att. C.I.G.S.



1.	    Off-the-Course Betting.



M-F.	Breach of law is w’spread.

	Police are corrupted.

	Off course illegal betting is larger than legal betting – in nos. of punters.



P.M.	Canalise betting thro’ totes vice bookies because first benefits racing &amp; bookies only benefit themselves.



M-F.	Won’t affect this.



H.M.	Labour will exploit us.  Shdn’t decide in absence of A.E. &amp; R.A.B.



J.S.	Ventilate in P. Members’ motion debate.



H.C.	Get Television over first.



			Resume discussion after B’muda.
