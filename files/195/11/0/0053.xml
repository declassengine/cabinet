C.C. 46(53).				28th July, 1953.





	1.	Korea.                                                      [Enter  S.Ll., B-H., Ll.G.



Sal.	Cab. earlier decision.  D.’s reply : 1602.  Para. 3 was an improvement.

		I welcomed this concession &amp; agreed to subscribe on that basis.

	No. 1609 did not, however, carry out promises of D.

	F.O. 3015 and 3016 give our counter-draft’s designed to make these

		points clear.  Under this language, we shd. not be commd. save

		in event of unprovoked attack by Communists.

	Will be included in documentn. to be handed over to Communists in

		about one week’s time.



J.S.	Wise to tell Opposn. – so they don’t think we are holding it back until

		Parlt. has risen.



Sal.	Wd. like to do that – if they can be trusted.



H.C.	Tell C.R.A. &amp; H.M. alone.  After H/L. debate on f. affairs.





	2.	Germany:  National Anthem.



Sal.	May D. uber Alles be regarded as official Nat. Anthem of G. Republic.

		We play it in G.  May we play it in U.K. on appropte. occasions.



			Agreed : No objn.





	3.	Food Prices.



Ll.G.	Two pp. connected.  Decided in June to defer.  If no decn. before 

		recess, 2 more mos’ delay - &amp; increases wd. then have to be 

		larger if subsidy to be held to same figure.

	Total effect on c/living : .54.

	Milk will be coming down – equivalent almost.



R.A.B.	Can’t allow subsidy total to creep up.  ½ point is not v. much.



W.M.	Sorry : but needn’t appear until Oct. in c/living index.



			Approved.



				[Enter  F.H. &amp; D.E.

	4.	Supply Expenditure.



R.A.B.	Publ. interest (Times etc.,) in continuing burden of public expendre.

	Defence &amp; Social Services.

	Working for solution on Defence wh. will help economy w’out

		wrecking defence.

	Social Services.  Health &amp; Old Age:  Cttees. shd. help.

		Leaves Housing &amp; L. Govt. ancillaries &amp; Education.

	See no gt. economy over Educn. w’out sacking teachers.

	Housing – our hopes are placed in the Grand Design.  De-control of

		rents wd. have as gt. effect on confidence as end of food

		subsidies.

		Hope we can discuss that one day.

	Interim report.  Take note.  Promise co-opn.  Make me proposals wh.

		wd. help me with Budget.



O.L.	Budget deficits in Malaya &amp; Kenya – to which U.K. will have to

		contribute.



R.A.B.	Was assumg. £18M. for Malaya.  Less for Kenya.  May get some 

		relief over Egypt.



H.M.	Housing.   Aug. 5.   145.000 in 1st 6. months 1953.

			Publn.     110.000   ..        ..            1952.

			                 92.000   ..        ..            1951.

	Shall achieve target.  50.000 un-subsidised in ’53. ;  &amp; hope for

		50/90,000 in’54.  Am therefore beginning to close down on l.a. 

		p’mmes.

	Contn. of M/W.  20% more bricks &amp; 25% more cement by same no. of

		men.  We have proved tht. productivity rises when order books 

		are full.  Tho’ we mustn’t run ahead of our materials.

	The Grand Design.  To switch fr. new houses to old, and to include

		more un-subsidised in the new.  Cttee. under L.P.S. has made 

		progress.  Draft W. Paper is now with printer, and will be

		circulated to-morrow with note of points outstanding.  Shd. go		to members of L.P.S. Cttee. who aren’t Cab. members. Shd. 

		expect decns. in Oct. Cabinets.  Publish English wh. Paper in 

		week before Prorogation &amp; leave it to be discussed in D. on 

		Address.   Once this is touched off, we must see it thro’.  Means 

		no dissolution for 18 months.  Must get it thro’ and working 

		before Genl. Election.



J.S.	Endorse last point – v. strongly.



H.M.	I will draft statement which we shd. have to make if it were decided

		not to go on with full plan.



D.E.	Para. 6 of memo. 211.  Dissent – unless we go right above 

		300,000 level.

	Cab. authorised £157M. new starts more than last year.  Have

		started £125M. in 1st. half year.  But good reason to believe

		this is exceptional – shall not increase at that rate.  Materials

		posn. will carry 300,000 houses + 6% or 7% expansion in other

		construction.



R.A.B.	Danger if l.a.’s soar above 300.000 target – qua subsidy and 

		materials.



H.M.	Mustn’t fall below level of Socialist achievement in houses to let.



F.H.	Education.  Increased nos. of children in primaries this year &amp; last.

		Only big saving is in radical change.  Altering school age.  If it

		were poss. for them to leave at 14 voluntarily, more than half

		wd. elect to remain.  Even so, cdn’t sack corresp. no. of 

		teachers – for wd. be compelled to use surplus to reduce size

		of classes, wh. in some areas reach 60 or 70.

	Fees.  Odd to give increased children’s allowances &amp; then charge

		fees for compulsy. education.  Also means test, &amp; adminn.

	I see no alternative but to press for adminve. economies – tho’ they will

		not be large.

	Teachers’ salaries – increases now being demanded.



R.A.B.	May have to re-consider relative shares of local &amp; central Govt.



W.	Is not policy re aid to University students too generous?

		Supply of games equipmt., taxi-fares etc.



F.H.	Income standards are pretty severe – and have bn. reduced lately.



P.T.	Para. 6 of memo. 166.  Facilities for cheap borrowg. below the

		line are dangerous.  We are doing too much – at expense of 

		exports.  We have all tried to find redns. – agree only major

		changes of policy will do, &amp; I doubt if we can make these w’out

		a fresh mandate.



R.A.B.	Food subsidies – can get more off them e.g. milk subsidy.

		Freeing economy in food has helped this year’s Budget.



Ll.G.	So many of remaing. subsidies are tied up with implemn. of Agric. Act.

		Profits on imported meat &amp; bacon will disappear on de-control:  

		and subsidies to home industry will cost you more than now.



R.A.B.	£100M. wd. take care of those. 



R.A.B.		i)    Take note of 166 conclns., para. 17.

		ii)       ..      ..    ..  statements by M/H. &amp; M/W. – esp. 

	    	          their assurance tht. they will prevent excessive

	  	            bldg.  Congrats. on achievemt.

		iii)   Let me discuss Educn. with M/Ed. incldg. long-term.

		iv)   E.P.C. to consider food subsidies.

		v)    Demands on market by natd. indies. &amp; l.a.’s

		vi)   V. careful pruning of Estimates for autumn.

	If we get somethg. out of those, &amp; a reasonable decn. on Defence, we

		can get past Budget for ’54.  It is ’55 that is grim.

				[Exit  Ll.G., F.H.



				[Enter  P.M.G.

	5.	Television of Opening of Parliament.



H.C.	Not a thing to be rushed.

	If we wished to do it, many prior consultns.

	This year anyway wd. be a mistake.

	Queen’s Speech shd. not in any event be included.



Sal.	This is a political occasion, unlike Coronation.



R.A.B.	Will come up again – in future years.  Continue consultns.



H.C.	No : don’t put idea into anyone’s head.



D.E.	Shd. have to bring in news-reels too.  And physically it wd. be v. diff.

		to do – even in R. Gallery.



PMG.	Agree with L.P.  If you began in R. Gallery, you wd. be pressed to

		carry it into Chamber in following year.

				[Exit  D.E.



	6.	Post Office Staff Associations.



W.	Advised P.M.G. on political grounds not to make this statement.



PMG.	Statement rejected claims of EOTA and gave summary of reasons.

		Wd. have wished to make it, but deferred to W.’s request.

		Promised in June (52?) to decide w’in 6  



			Discussion adjourned for reading of draft.



W.M.	Marler has assured me tht. his motion implies no disloyalty – only

		a demonstration of reluctance at having to make this retreat.

		He won’t be awkward.





	7.	Legislative Programme.



H.C.	Some worth-while achievements e.g. Food &amp; Drugs, Coal Mines 

		Safety.

		Opposn. wd. envy these.

	Three only with Party controversy – Housing, Leasehold,

		T &amp; C. Planning.

	A v. dull p’mme.  Especially if it were our last.  But wd. be 

		consistent with “period of steady adminn.”.

	But, if we embark on Grand Design, can’t dissolve until passed &amp;

		results seen.

	Two other pol. topics in air – University Repn. &amp; H/L. Reform –

		not covered in this p’mme.



Ch.	Hope there will be room for A.E.O. Bill, now as low as E.



H.C.	Approval by Cab. wd. be a special case for promoting to earlier 

		category.



Sim.	H/L. Cttee. has bn. suspended since S. has taken over F.O.



Sal.	Might resume in autumn.

	Two schools of thought  i) Scottish plan – election of repve.

		hereditary Peers.  ii) Mere legalisn. of Life Peerages.

		Agreement : no wide extension of powers.   Some thght 

		period of suspensory veto mght. be extended by 6 months.

	Will see if I can present interim report for Cabinet.



W.	No hurry – don’t burden yourself.



R.A.B.	Need such a report before we settle Queen’s Speech.	Agreed.

	Must also consider University Repn.  May be a growing 

		feeling in Universities tht. it shd. not be restored.



M.F.	As we rejected plural voting I don’t think Univ. repn. is practicable.

		But Cab. shd. consider this.  For if no Univ. repn. in H/C., Cttee.

		shd. consider wtr. it shd. be included in a reformed H/L.



			Agreed : M-F to consider &amp; report during summer.



P.T.             x/	May Copyright Bill go up to class E?	Agreed.

		{	Provisional P’mme approved subject to x/.

		{	Reports on H/L. Reform &amp; University Repn.

		{	Major Bills on Housing etc., - final decns. on Queen’s 

			        Speech.





	8.	Genocide : International Convention.



M-F.	Prepared Bill &amp; outlined difficulties, as in memo. para. 3.

		But Bill must pass if we are to adhere to the Convention.



Sal.	F.O. believe there may be strong public pressure for this.  Why not

		wait for it?



S.Ll.	42 other countries have ratified.  Small group in H/C. press for it.



R.A.B.	Not U.S.  Need we?	(Janner)



S.Ll.	We have alleged in H/C. tht. reason for delay if diffy. in drafting Bill.

			Note that Bill is ready.

			See if U.S. ratifies.  Otherwise no action.





	9.	Review of Parliamentary Constituencies.



M-F.	By statute it rests with Commns to decide when to undertake general

		reviews.  They have decided to start &amp; have formally notified

		me.  It wd. be normal for me to say so in H/C.



H.C.	They won’t start in Aug.



M.F.	Their intention will be announced quite soon, in Gazette.



J.S.	No need for early Govt. announcemt.

	Won’t be started for some time &amp; won’t be completed until early ’54.



H.C.	Why shdn’t we let it come out, as from them.  Avoid impn. tht. it has

		anything to do with Govt.



R.A.B.	Wd. prefer P.Q. reply vice statement.



B-H.	For written answer.



			Agreed:  announce in written reply to P.Q.

			               M-F. to circulate report showg. what Commns. will

			               do, for information.





	10.	Barbados.



O.L.	Oldest constitution in Col. Empire.  Ch. Minister was to have bn. 

		called P.M.  Am proposing to insist on Premier.  Don’t want

		P.M. in an area where there is to be Federation, perhaps.

	Think Grantley Adams will accept that.



			Agreed.





	6.	Post Office Staff Association (contd).



R.A.B.	Wd sooner p’pone until Aug.



PMG.	Ll-Roberts excuse is v. thin because he has told me he can do no

		more.



R.A.B.	Feeble to say in Aug. what we cd. have said before House rose.

		Disposed to get it over.



W.	Influenced by Watkinson (M/L.) who because diffy. with T.U.’s didn’t

		want it up in H/C.



W.M.	Not industrial embarrassment.  He feared debate - ½ Supply Day on 

		Thursday.  Mght seem to divide Tory Party.

H.C.	They cdn’t debate it on Thursday – business is settled.  And Opposn.

		won’t want a debate.

	There will always be trouble with Party.  Get it over now.

	Only chance of debate wd. be on adjournment on Friday.



	Agreed :	Make statement of Thursday in both Houses.

		Draft considered.  Suggns. made.

		     *	W. with PMG &amp; M/L. with Gammans &amp; M-F. &amp; H.C.

			        to put it into final shape.

			Gammans can make a shorter version orally in H/C. &amp;

			        circulate the longer version.
