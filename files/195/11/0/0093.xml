 C.C. 10(54).				22nd February, 1954.



	1.	Four-Power Meeting.



A.E.	i)	Extreme rigidity of Sov. posn.  Not prepd. to yield on

		anything – even Austr.  Why?  Two possible reasons -

		a) they daren’t give way :  thinkg. tht. if they do they will

		be pressed all round.  Austria :  if they w’draw,

		Hungary (l of c) will invite them to go.  No hope of

		change because based on weakness.

		b) Figl thght Kremlin v. mil. regime.  Reason was solely

		military.

			I prefer a) tho’ b) not inconsistent with it.

	E.D.C.   They don’t really fear it.  Merely a means of splitting us.

	When I put my view to M. &amp; asked him what was his alternative,

		he admitted in effect he had none.  Believe therefore they

		will not react v. violently if we go on with E.D.C.

	But genuine fear of U.S.  Hence objn. to bases. Exp’re on infrastructure.

		U.S. speeches &amp; Press.  R. are really nervous of them.  M.

		seemed to accept my assurance tht. our bases wd. not be used

		for aggressive purpose.

	“Double-talk.”  E.g. democracy, elections etc., mean quite diff. things

		to R.  They really don’t understand our meanings of these words.

	But Mtg. has not left heightened temperature.  No bitterness.



	China.  M. wanted 5-Power Mtg. v. much.  Not merely to raise Ch.

		prestige or he wdn’t have given way on composn.  D. &amp; B.

		both think Kremlin is nervous of Ch. – now Stalin is dead.

		They may do somethg. rash &amp; involve R. in it.  M. really began

		to negotiate for a Mtg – quite diff. fr. attitude on G.



	Germany.  In may 2 yrs. since Bonn agreemts. G. are getting 

		impatient:  not Adenauer but lesser politicians :  and critical of

		of West.  They are doing well economically &amp; getting arrogant.

		We haven’t long in wh. to get G. in on E.D.C. terms :  they will

		begin to ask for more.  cf M. Guardian to-day.  Can’t therefore

		afford to fiddle along over EDC. for long.



	France.  B. was good – neither hectored nor cozened by R.



	M. seemed disapptd. at end.  Prs. expected more disarray – surely not

		more results.  Hard to see why he chose Berlin – bad for R. –

		unless he hoped to divide us.



	Association with E.D.C.  Tel. 409 of 20/2.  Shall have to study that.



	D. showed courage re China.  May be in trouble in U.S. over this.



	Little chance of change in R. policy in Europe.  May be some in China.

		Several years of stalemate in E.  We must go on with defence.		For can’t hope to negotiate with R. except from strength – even		if then.



P.M.	B. said at W’ton mtg. tht. failure of a Mtg. wd. help him to get E.D.C.		Thro’ Fr. Parliament.



Sal.	Yes.  B. wants E.D.C.



P.M.	Can we do more to help French to ratify E.D.C.?

		We must have a G. army.  Opposn. here won’t make serious			diffies.



AE.	Some small things prs.  But not the assurance he sought at B’muda

		about continuing level of U.S. &amp; Br. forces in Europe.  It’s a

		legitimate fear:  but how can we satisfy him?



P.M.	Must avoid posn. in wh. we are expected to stay while U.S. troops go.

		Cd. we ear-mark token force to serve with E.D.C. e.g. an

		armoured divn.?  Wd. sooner do that.



A.E.	Have considered – armd. brigade grp. wd. be enough.  But v. awkward

		constitutionally.



Al.	E.g. uniform, pay, discipline etc.

			*AE and Al. undertook to consider.*



P.M.	End of Mtg. attempt stresses need to try alternative of E/W. trade.

		We want peace (&amp; peaceful relns.) as well as strength.

	Must ensure Br. people have clear conscience tht. we are trying to

		take edge off internl. relns. &amp; tht. we are trying our best to get 

		more normal relations.   We cd. press U.S. to take easier view 		on strategic goods.  We shd. have a more united P. opinion if

		we had the lollypop as well as the cane.



A.E.	Talked to M. – he didn’t mention strategic goods.





	2.	Kenya.



O.L.	Parly. Delegn. report.  Have undertaken to publish.  At end, Mau-Mau

		oath.  Shd. we publish?  It is such filth.



P.M.            x/	Put it in Library.  Only M.P.’s to read it.  In charge of an official.



Sw.	Shdn’t Press know of it.  Don’t suggest they publish it.



P.M.            y/	Let Newsp. Proprietors’ Assocn. have access to it, via Press Council.



Sim.	Lawyers are familiar with this in ritual murders.



Sal.              z/	Let Lobby see it?



P.M.	Yes.



P.M.	And if M.P.’s press for publn., we shall have support for doing it.





	3.	Persia.



A.E.	Will tell U.S. Govt. thro’ Makins tht. we think AIOC shd. have 

		44% &amp; balance to other Cos. in the talks – 8% each.  One is 

		Shell.  Prefacing this by saying we wd. have preferred this

		negotiated thro’ Cos.

	Last resort :  40% AIOC.  20% Shell.  40% others (U.S.).

		The Fr. share in that event shd. not come from A.I.O.C. or 

		Shell.



R.A.B.	Wd. accept either.  Don’t want U.S. to have more than 35% if poss.

		because they remit in dollars.

				[Exit  G.Ll.

				[Enter  J.T. C.N.S.

	4.	Antarctica.



A.E.	Argentine naval repves. (equivalent of 1st. Lord) going to A. in

		unarmed ship.

	Courses  i)    turn a blind eye.

		     ii)    protest in B.A.

		     iii)   turn it back by force

			         prs. fire a salute &amp; let it be mistaken for an attack.

	They cd. bring up reserves much more quickly than we.

		      iv)  our frigate cd appear &amp; tail them – doing nothg. violent.

                    x/	 Legally, we cd. strengthen our claim to sovereignty by welcoming

		them as guests on our territory.  Wd. H/C. understand that?



P.M.	I like x/.



J.T.	We cd. provide frigate as escort – if we can find them.

			Agreed :  Follow her round and offer entertainment.

			               Admy. to submit instns. to A.E. &amp; P.M.

				[Exit  J.T. &amp; C.N.S.



	5.	Farm Price Review.



R.A.B.	We must lower prices.  Diffces. are only of degree.

	Save on milk I wd. like to see M/F. proposals adopted.

	Eggs – public scandal :  will reflect on our agricultural policy.

	Milk – eggs – cereals are the important ques for Cabinet.

	This is about the only hope for redn. in Budget.	

	If we can’t get redn. on prices, I shall have to revert to idea of subsidy.



T.D.	Diffies. now arise fr. success of our policy – increased prodn.

		Believe tht. even my figures go too far, in attempt to meet Ty.

		Tho’ I will stick to them.

	Ty. memo. on b/paymts shows anxiety for ’55.  Wdn’t it be v. unwise

		to risk losing momentum in home food-prodn.?

	Even my figures cdn’t be accepted by farmers:  settlement wd. have

		to be imposed.  Whatever we impose must be enforced :  no

		concession thereafter.

	Farmers expect an increase.  This will be first time there hasn’t been

		an increase.  H’to we have had full support fr. Party in H/C.

		Shan’t get that for less than my figures.  For first principle of

		our policy has bn – first chance to home producers :  and now

		Party wants control of import policy to ensure this.

	Milk.  The marginal man lives on it.

	Cereals.  World price is below ours for first time.  For 10 years

		Govts. have urged max. wheat prodn.  Diff. to slash price just

		when our farmers are producg. enough.



Ll.G.	Agree on importce. of stable &amp; prosperous agriculture.

	But in siege economy we aimed at prodn. at any cost – and we have

		achieved it.  Farmers will lose public sympathy if cost becomes

		known.  Pity to allow that to happen.

	Egg subsidy this year will be £28 M.  Wd. be £35 M next year on 

		same basis.

	Milk.  Will rise by 20 m. gall. this year.  We can’t dispose of it.

	Limit to what manufrs. will take.  Need therefore to reduce price in

		order to reduce prodn.  Milk is less needed now other food is

		available.

	Must move twds. known objective of departing fr. siege economy

		methods &amp; prices.

                    x|	Start negotn. with lower prices e.g. mine.  We shall be forced into

		some concessions.  Even on milk – where my figure is prs too

		high.  In 1952 we had to concede £14 M.



T.D.	I agree on x/.



W.M.	Milk.  £250M. are producer subsidies.  Diffce. of £8M. on milk.

		RAB says, if no more than 1d. on milk, he will consider

		putting ½d. on retail price.  Wd, yield £7M. but .5 on c/l. index.

		And psychol. effect wd. be v. great.  Housewife cdn’t be 

		persuaded we were trying to keep c/l. down if we put up milk

		price when there is surplus of milk.  Anyway you wd. decrease

		consumptn. and so increase surplus.

	I support M/F. in general but want the cut on producers’ end.



M.F.	Milk &amp; eggs are most important to small farmers (N.I.).



R.A.B.	Farmers are worried not bitter.  Doubt if we shd. cut milk by 2d. for

		so many depend on that.  Cd. start at 2d., but shdn’t insist on it.



T.D.	Eggs.  We think cost at 4/- wd. be only £15 M. next year, if linked

		with feeding-stuffs.



W.	Try for 1½d. on milk.  No chance of 2d.  Politically, of most concern.



O.L.	Diffce. betwn 2 Ministers is £40 M.  Too big for negotiating.

                   y|		Start therefore at point halfway between T.D. and Ll.G.  And

		fall back on T.D. figure, but only if driven to it.



A.E.	Agree.  To start from Ll.G. figures wd. cause explosion.

			Agreed :  start negotiating on milk at 1½d.



R.A.B.	Can’t go on with agric. policy as now.

		Want to re-consider eggs. – on basis of lump sum for a

		limited number.  Suggest this be remitted to us to report

		again on Wedy.



T.D.	Fertilisers?



R.A.B.	Ty. shd. share in any fall in prices :  at moment farmers are getting

		whole benefit.  Can settle this with T.D.



A.E.	Decide provisionally on y/.  But argue strenuously.



	Agreed.	R.A.B. to bring up long-term ques of producer subsidies.





	6.	Uganda.



	a)	Royal Visit.

O.L.	As in memo.  Visit shd. go fwd. save for Mengo.



P.M.	Yes.  But watch situation &amp; revise plans if it deteriorates.



	b)	Policy Statement.

O.L.	Object :  regain initiative.  Nothing new – makes it more precise.

		Can never be a white man’s country.  Not like Rhodesias.



			Approved.





	7.	Town and Country Planning.



H.M.	Bill must be introduced in a few days – so as to allow time before 

		2nd. Rdg.  Must go thro’ – because paymts. outstanding.  It is

		for its sake we are guillotining Housing &amp; Rents Bill.

	Original plan.  Once-for-all purchase of developmt. rights.

		Now we are to pay as we go.  Limit (admitted claims) was

		£350 M.  We shall now have to pay only £75 M. over next few		years – only for planning disallowed.

	Attack on our Bill will be :  all land is put back into free market &amp; 

		planning will be hampered.  We rely on consents.  They will

		then say :  money will determine it.  I want therefore to charge

		£75 M. to Cons. Fund :  to pay off backlog &amp; see us thro’ first

		few years :  so as to have answer to claim tht. dead hand of Ty.

		will determine amount of planning.

	Estimates for housing etc., – if cut, no harm is done, tho’ benefit may

	|	be p’poned.  On this, if money is not available to decline

                      x|	consent, irreparable damage may be done.

	After a few years we cd. go back to normal Ty. control.

	Recognise tht., if precedent, this wd. be dangerous.  But this is special

		case.	   i)  Total is limited :  no-one can get more than admitted

		claim.  ii)  Can’t estimate cost in any year.

			   iii) x/ above.

	Income of dev. charge had no real relation to £300 M.

	I was founder of P.E.P.  Am now accused of betraying planning.

		Matter of honour for me.  I wd. sooner have stuck to ’47 Act

		than commit planning wholly to financial control.  We shall

		re-open the old land controversy.  But, by my way, we can say :		it will be decided on merits &amp; paymt. made on ascertained facts.



R.A.B.	Ministers when administering discretionary service have always had		to obtain their money by Vote, approved in advance by Parlt.

	Nothg. like a loan on Con. Fund.  Certainly no discretionary admn.

	My compromise was to carry back-log (or automatic paymts by

		Land Fund) on loan :  but new current adminn. on Votes.



H.M.	This offer doubles the injury.  I’m not concerned about total money.

		Emphasises the fact that future will be subject to Ty. veto.



P.M.	Votes aren’t quite sacrosanct.  Supplementaries show that Votes

		aren’t guarantee of financial probity.

	Precedent argument.  Cabinet is still in control.  Can refuse it if

		there were a less good case.



R.A.B.	Supplementaries have to be obtained fr. Parlt.

	Ministers with discretion must go to Parlt. for their money.



Sw.	This Bill limits Minister’s discretion.  Past claims to be paid.

		Future decisions are to depend on planning merits not finance.		The paymt. is automatic thereafter.



H.M.	Decision shd. not rest on amount of money remaining in his Vote

		for the year.



Sal.	Objects of legn. (1947 &amp; this) were planning of England.

	We have scrapped the once-for-all.  But we are not starting quite

		afresh.  Object is to make new system work as well.  That being

		so, I support H.M.  Only by his method can he be certain of

		reachg. right planning decision.  If he has to seek Supplementary

		he can’t appear to be wholly free.  This course is justified

		because we are proceeding fr. £300 M. scheme.



P.M.	We have gone back on promise to buy the rights.



Sim.	All claims known.  A fund to meet claims as they materialise will

		involve no discretion to Minister save wtr circs. have arisen

		when paymt. shd. be made.  If claims had to be paid by some

		external body, no discretion wd. vest in Minister.  This really

		is sui generis.



			             Discussion adjourned.
