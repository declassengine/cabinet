C.C. 103(52)							8th December, 1952



		1.	Commonwealth Economic Conference.	[Enter Sw.



A.E.	Decide i)  not to go on with plan on a 4 power basis.

		ii) Not to enter on formal Ministerial discns. with other countries 	until we know tht. Asiatics will come in.



O.L.	Agree.



R.A.B.	Can’t contemplate India being linked with $ &amp; conting. to draw on central reserves.

	Conference has gone well.  Shd. try to achieve at least oppy. of informal talk with U.S.  Their attitude, if favourable, wd. influence Asiatics.

	But let’s be plain tht. I.M.F. will get to know Indian posn. &amp; it will come out.

	Large chance tht. India will come in, at the end.



A.E.	Not so sure.  Nehru will see the pol. diffies. more clearly.



Sal.	D. will press.  Scheme will be changed after consultn. with U.S.



A.E.	Prs. Makins cd. talk it over first.  If their re-action were favourable, we cd. ask India where they stand.  Must get their posn. clear before Ministers go to Washington.



R.A.B.	Importance of political issues.  We cd. make a better sterling area without India and Australia.  But of course it wd. be politically disastrous.

	We must, politically, hold together.  The plan together, or something different together.

	Advantage of the plan is that it enables us to talk to U.S. on a positive, forward-looking plan.



H.M.	Must preserve st. area.  Plan, if it goes fwd., must commit area as a whole.  They must therefore accept fl. rate : &amp; all the safeguards for ourselves.  Are these being whittled away in Conference?

	Risky even if we hang together.  If it breaks us up, no advantage in going fwd. with so dangerous a plan.



A.E.	What have we whittled away?



Ch.	No q.v. : then standstill on q.v. : now all are opting out.



R.A.B.	We now abolish q.v. only to extent tht we reduce dollar gap.



Ch.	Good creditor policies by U.S.  No action before Congress approves.

	Now intended to rest on assurances by U.S. Govt.  



A.E. 	No.  We wdn’t launch anythg. w’out real assurance of U.S. support.  



Sw. 	Don’t become convertible until Fund is in existence.



Ch.	E.P.U.  Break-up.  



A.E. 	Only if other arrangemts made wh. they approve.  We won’t act until we have Eur. countries lined up too.



R.A.B.	We have also to be satisfied on future pattern of world trade.



Ch.	I.M.F. statutes must be altered.  



R.A.B. 	Yes.  But new Cttee. will be advisory.  And proposal for annual review has bn. dropped.



H.M.	If this fails, we shall have to do somethg. on our own.



Ch.	No need to despair.  U.S. surplus is shrinking.  And past crises were due to Socialist blunders.



R.A.B.	Want to approach U.S. with a plan tht. doesn’t involve continuing discrimn. v. the $.

	Redn. in dollar gap is largely due to U.S. generosity.



O.L.	U.S. has bn. obliged to play old game for creditor countries – save tht. they gave their surplus away instead of lending it.





		2.	Imperial Preference.



Sw.	Reported results of consn. of the “limited issue”.  Doms. will support us in seeking relief there.

	Accordable preference.  Thought unwise to link this with present approach.  But sympathetic to later ad hoc approaches.

	On specific duties : no advantage to us on balance to get freedom to increase amounts.



H.M.	We free ourselves fr. this inconvenience.  But Imp. Pref. as an instrument of economic welfare has had a severe set-back.



A.E.	We shall be lucky if we get even the limited concession.



H.C.	Shall we be free to say tht. Doms. didn’t want it?



Sal.	We must.  Tell them before they leave tht. we shall feel free to say so.





		3.	Pacific Pact.



P.M.	Talk with M. &amp; Holl. re Anzus at Chequers.

	Holl. wants a public announcemt. suggestg. approach to an “understanding”.  he suggests joing opns. (? talks) betwn. Anzus &amp; Anzam.

	I promised further talk.

	Sitn. has changed – by their intimate conversations with us.



A.E.	Doesn’t alter the fact tht. Anzus draws them into U.S. policy on F/E.





		4.	Pakistan.



Sal.	Cttee. on Constitn. has recommended tht. P. become a republic w’in the Commonwealth.  They argue tht. India gets better treatment fr. U.K. than P.

	Rpt. will be publd. before end/year.  Discussed with Constit. Ass.  Final decn. not before Coronation. 

N. asked for talks with PM’s.  Oppose this – in absence of Nehru &amp; Malan – &amp; no previous notice.



	Consultn. is required : but it cd. be done by telegram.



		Agreed : no discussion at Conference.





		5.	Kashmir.



Sal.	At P.M.’s request, explained state of U.N. discussions.  Our resoln. (likely to be supported by U.S.) is acceptable to P.  If India makes diffies. what next?



	Will circulate a memo. to Cabinet on this.
