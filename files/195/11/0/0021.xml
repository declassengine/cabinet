C.C. 13(53)							19th February, 1953



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Wed : Opposn. may want statement by M/D. on Korea (M. ready, if required) – because of speculn. over relief of Comm. Brigade.



P.M.	No need to do this in advance of Defence Debate on 3/3.  Wd. be exploited by anti-Americans.  



H.C. 	Will say this will be covered in Def. Debate.



A.E.	M/D. was to talk on Egypt to Def. group and I to F.A. group – on same day.



	Diff. to say anything at this stage.  Must co-ordinate our statements.



P.M.	Mght indicate there may be somethg. they will like fairly soon.





		2.	Malaya.



O.L.	C.O.S. consider tht. if French are driven out of Indo-China, only defensible posn. will be on Sonkla posn. in Siamese territory.  Wd. take 4 months to make it firm : wd. take same time for Comm. to get there.

	Cab. shd. be warned tht. they may be asked at short notice to authorise this, w’out Siamese consent.



P.M.	Suggest small Cab. Cttee. shd. go into this in detail.

	No immediate hurry – L.P. cd. preside : other members as in brief.

	M’while, utmost secrecy.  No word to U.S. yet.

	M/D. mght visit U.S. later in summer, and take this up inter alia.





		3.	Egypt.



P.M.	Read letter to Eisenhower.



A.E.	Message recd. y’day tht. new Adminn. in U.S. accept C(53)17. documents.

	They have also told E., w’out provocn. fr. us, to shut up re Sudan.





		4.	Scotland : Postal Services.



P.M.	Best method of indicatg. disapproval is to do nothg.  An ungainly tempy. structure for a long time.



J.S.	Don’t want any more “E.II” boxes in Scotland – to avoid further trouble.  Cd. we not have Scottish crest instead?  M/W. use it on bldgs and Mint on Sc. shillings.  The Queen uses it on her notepaper in Scotland.

	Geo V. instructed G.P.O. not to use the V.



P.M.	I wd. have left them without a box – to suffer inconvenience.



G.	It wasn’t local residents who blew up the box.



P.M.	Cd. you not take it away now?



G.	E.R.II is on R. Scots Memorial in Princes St. and on M/L. bldg. in Motherwell.

	Ready to use up old G.R. boxes, but that wd. be only tempy. solution.



P.M.	J.S. remedy wd. be complete scuttle.  No decision for future : m’while take the box away &amp; leave them w’out the facility.  Or, if you are afraid to do that, leave it there.  Use G.R. boxes (will last 1 year) &amp; avoid sending E.R. vehicles to Scotland.



J.S.	What do we do at end of 6 mos?



P.M.	That might be a subject for individual meditation.



							            [Exit Gammans.

		5.	Flood Damage.				[Enter Dugdale.



		Government Contribution



M.F.	Suggd. to R.A.B. £1 for £1.  Unlikely tht. subs. will exceed £1½M.

	Wd. encourage subs.

	Govt. gave £1M. in ’47.  But also £ for £ to an agricult. fund, so total was £1.8 m.

	Eve supports that suggn.



R.A.B.	Outlook for Govt. expendre. on this is serious, apart fr. contn. to Fund. 100% grants for various measures.  Lodging allowances : troops : free transport : N. Assistce. – £2½ M. prs. already and will increase, esp. on sea defence work.

	Govt. cd. not have done more, Ty. included.  We have a good case.

	Fund.  If Eve is going to do all outside insurance co. field, there is a big liability for compensn.  If he is content with £ for £ that suits me.  This is best arrangemt. we can make pending final adjustment.  Can cover matching overseas contns. except those earmarked for specific purposes.  (as a hedge v. getting U.S. counterpart aid).



P.M.	Need you put animals on the Fund?



M.F.	Only 1.000 cattle, 8.000 sheep etc.,  Not a v. large problem.



R.A.B.	Don’t want a new &amp; separate Fund for agricultural relief.

T.D.	Livestock loss will be only about £200,000.



	[Lynmouth.



Sim.	Fortescue is seeking means, thro’ charity Commn., to divert balance of Lynmouth Fund to Floods Fund.  A Ch. Commn. scheme.]



H.M.	Opposn. will argue tht. whole loss be carried by Ty. – by W. Dam. scheme.  I shall reply tht. this wd. mean premium : and payout every 300 years.  Vol. adminn. is more satisf. than Govt. adminn. of public money.



P.M.	We hold to principle of private charity aiding the State.  Let the Opposn. put their Socialist view – I don’t care.



J.S.	Canadian offer of help.  We wd. like tractors to clear timber.  Wd. be of continuing value to us.



R.A.B.	O.a.p. tobacco coupons – inclined to give concession there.  But want to resist claim re purchase tax. (remission on new stocks?)



H.M.	That can be done thro’ Fund : it was done at Lynmouth.  Tobacconists’ stock is 80% tax.

	Loss of houses, at most, will be 700-1.000.



J.S.	Honours – an immediate List.  Proposals to go to P.M.



								[Exit T.D.

		6.	Cotton : Importing &amp; Marketing.		[Enter A.S.



P.T.	Can’t see our way to re-open Lpl. Cotton Exchange.  Lancs. agreed.  Hopk. Cttee. apptd. instead.  This broke monopoly of Cotton Commn.  30% contracted out last year : probably will be 60% next.  This involves two problems i) cover ii) future of Commn.  Para. 5 of memo.

	Decisions sought are in para. 15.

	Lpl. Cotton Exchange : unlikely we shall be able to re-open. Merchants agree.



O.L.	Memo. is constructed on premise tht. opening of futures market is out of ques.



P.T.	Merchants say it is unless free import &amp; export.



O.L.	But study wthr. those condns. cd. be restored.



Ch.	Proposal of Govt. insurance v. fluctuations in price goes rather far.

	Encourages private enterprise w’out risk.



Sw.	We are in diff. transitional stage.  ⅔rds will be bought by spinners : only ⅓rd by Commn.  But same insurance v. loss is to be offered to the ⅔rds when we have only ⅓rd. chance of making countervailing profit.



O.L.	Remember merchants sell as well as buy.  They sell overseas.



R.A.B.	I am running inconvertible currency – with inadequate reserves.  I can’t therefore take the risk involved in convertible commodities.



P.T.	I agree.  I cdn’t press Ty. to accept that risk.



Ch.	I agree.  Mght have v. dangerous dollar drain.  But why shdn’t traders carry the risk?  



P.T. 	Because they can’t deal freely in dollars.



A.S.	This has disadvantage of ½ way house.  But with currency posn. as now there’s no alternative.  Can’t have free market unless merchants are free to trade in futures on U.S. market – an unknown commitment in dollars.



P.M.	Cd. they not have that freedom w’in limits?  



Ch.  	No : there wd. be a drain, as under arbitrage scheme.



H.C.	Can’t you promise a date for legn. in ’54.  Merely take note that legn. will probably be needed next Session.



H.M.	Present this as covering only 53/54 season.  



P.T.  	Yes.

							[Exit A.S.



		7.	The Coronation Oath.



P.M.	Can’t discuss to-day.

	Wd. say on Mon. tht. it has all bn. considered v. carefully &amp; promise to circulate a memo. with Hansard.



Sim.	Para.15 is the awkward point for public discussion.



Sw.	Raises the whole ques. of legn. at W’minster for all Doms.

	They wd. have to legislate.  And they wd. decline.

	We have them in line now.  This wd. re-open it altogether.



P.M.        x/.	Can argue tht. the process wd. be endless.  It is already too late to secure Comm. agreemt. on this in time.



Sim.	Can urge the same considn. v. proposal re Speaker.

	I hope to get Coronn. Cttee. to squash this proposal.



P.M.	Let Sim. prepare answer on ques. of legality.

	The line of resistance shd. be x/.

	With M.F. &amp; Sw.

	Precedence of Foreigners – Note taken.



P.M.	Hope Germany may have higher place.  A.E. Will consider that again.





		8.	Industrial Disputes.



		Austin Motors.  Position noted.
