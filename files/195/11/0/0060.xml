C.C. 55 (53)					6th October, 1953



77.	    British Guiana.		    [Enter J.T., C.N.S., A.L-B., P.B-H.	



O.L.	Quiet in Colony.



P.M.	Blunt statement shd. be made this p.m.  Secrecy has failed.  Candour shd. now rule.  Precautions for m’tenance of law &amp; order.



O.L.	That is now in preparation.  



P.M.	Submit for my approval.



P.M.	Need Admiral have sailed in person?  Why not be consistent in his statements?  Let me have report on that.



A.E.	U.S. Govt. have bn. bold no more than what is in Press.  Embassy are probing &amp; picking up crumbs.  I wd. now favour telling U.S., in W’ton, w’out delay.



O.L.	I agree.



			Agreed.



H.C.	Also old Doms.



			Agreed.



A.E.	And rather less to Venezuela &amp; Holland.



H.C.	And new Doms?



P.M.	Send them communiqué : nothing more “in confidence”.





1.	    Egypt.

79)	

A.E.	Have told Hankey to stand pat.  “We want a new agreement if we can get it:  but won’t have a bad one.”

	Only good answer is on Canal – their formula is as good as theirs.

	Availability will be a good breakg. point.





1.	    E/West Trade : Sale of Ships to Soviet Bloc.

80)	

P.T.	As in memo.  Reasons:

i)	embargo is unnecessary strategically.

ii)	hard to defend our posn. as now.

iii)	need work in ship-yards.

	But we wd. ask for general control to be tightened – on fast m-ships &amp; special types.



A.E.	U.S. won’t like this.  Stage I cd. be accepted.  Stage II may give no trouble when we get to it.  Ready to start on this &amp; see how we get on.



J.T.	P.Q.’s when House meets.



P.M.	But choose a good moment – because risk of upsetting U.S.



Al.	No harm fr. strategic angle.  Real ques : are we going to antagonise U.S.  I fear we shall : &amp; don’t want to upset them.  Cdn’t we get U.S. to agree privately?



A.E.	Make the démarche in Paris group.  Report re-action to Cab. before next step is taken.

	Don’t bring in U.S. C.O.S.  They wd. certainly raise objns.



			Agreed : Talk in Paris w’out commitment.

			               And watch the timing.

					[Exit J.T. &amp; C.N.S.

					[Enter G. Ll.

1.	    Coal.

81)	

G.Ll.	17.3m. tons of stock – &amp; we aren’t at end of coal summer.  Better than level ever reached by Labour Govt.  Shall hope to start winter with 181/2m.  Includes 1.8.m. of house coal : not too bad.

	Production – not so good.  Hasn’t risen as expected after holidays.

	Feeling in coal-fields is good.

	Organisation of N.C.B.  Resisted Party pressure for enquiry.  Hope now to satisfy Party by de-centralisation plan.  Chairman also plans for Cttee. (with outsiders) into structure of organn. with view to achieving maximum decentralisation.  Unions more likely to accept this from Bd. than under pressure fr. Govt.

	Large Coal:  Falling by 2m. tons p.a.  Inevitable tendency because mechann.

Must therefore make consumers change habits – esp. rlways &amp; householders.

Rlways will use more briquettes, tho’ inconvenient. Ques is wtr. further briquetting capacity shd. be created.

		Householders are even more difficult – politically as well as otherwise.

		Free issue idea is radical : but must push somehow the new grates.



P.M.	Must have some inducement to buy them.



A.E.	V. disturbing.  More mechann. means more of the coal we don’t want.

V. unpopular with consumer.  Is it sense to go on with mechann. policy. 



G.Ll.	Retrograde to reverse or modify mechann. policy.

	Won’t get men to work by old methods.  Bad enough to persuade them to work the new.

	Other countries have accommodated themselves to small coal.  We are behind-hand in consumer habits.



Ll.G.	I agree.  Reid Cttee. concluded mechn. was inevitable – in order to get production required.

	Cd. distribution be considered.  Some domestic consumers are getting excessively large coal.



P.M.	Mght. not a Cttee. be helpful – incldg. some Labour repres., who share responsibility for this.



R.A.B.	We have the facts.  Memo. is an advance.  Hammer out a comprehensive coal policy (w’in W’hall).  Shall have to give financial help., on appliances.  Differential in price must make a bigger contrn. : proceeds cd. go twds. cost of subsidising appliances &amp; briqueting plants.



W.M.	Bring in man-power.  Force has dropped in recent months.

V. few areas where they want men.  In some there is redundancy.  Must be sure N.C.B. make good use of men they get.



H.M.	We can help a bit on grates – under improvement scheme as well as new houses.

	Bad business. NCB have bn. prodcg. coal we don’t need.  Rlways build engines wh. won’t burn the only coal we can produce.

Condemnation of nationalisation.



G.Ll.	Briquettes : will discuss further with N.C.B.



P.M.	Call Cttee. to concert a coal policy.



		R.A.B. (chairman), G.Ll., H.M., M/F., M/Labour, M/T.



L.P.	Let Cttee. tell me if anything can be done by Research Councils.



					        [Exit A.L-B., G.Ll.

					[Enter De la W., HA.

1.	    Television Policy.

82)	

R.A.B.	Shall have to declare at Margate that we have a plan – tho’ we need not commit ourselves to any particular plan.  Must be able to say we haven’t gone back on our policy for some element of competn. and a wh. Paper.

	Open competn. won’t do – because no control of standards.

	To ensure control, best practical choice is betwn. 2 types of corpn. to run stations and lease “time” to private cos.  Choice is between private or public finance.  I have bn. reluctant to provide public money:  but am forced to concln. tht. with private money there wd. not be enough assurances of control.

		Thus favour public corpn. apptd. by Govt.  About 1/2m. wd. be needed.  Small affair because limited scope.  Cd. be defended on defence grounds.  That wd. work.  Govt. might get its money back.

	Two reservations. i) Not yet ready to offer public money.  Want Cab. views on that.  ii) Do we at outset allow this corpn to handle religion &amp; politics.

	Promise at Margate tht. we shall go on and produce W. Paper outlining practical plan.

	Public Corpn. publicly financed wd. need legn.  PMG. thinks legn. wd. be needed for the other, too.



P.M.G.	£1/2 M. wd. be enough.  Public money is justifiable.  If Govt. favour competn., but insist on control, public corpn. with public money is warranted.



Sal.	Fair compromise – I wd. be ready to support it.  There shd. be public money if Govt. are to appoint directors.



A.E.	Regret this policy.  Esp. because religion and politics.



P.M.G.   *	Will submit a memo. on ques of religion and politics.



J.S.	Party wd. accept exclusion of r. &amp; p.



PMG.	Not sure : they say you leave only competition in jazz.



H.C.	Legn. will be difficult.  Think you wd. have to leave it to free vote all through.



B-H.	Must keep that open – at Margate.  Don’t know how it will go.



M.F.	Want to keep it open for opposite reason.  May be able to put Whips on.  This plan is less likely to alienate the Bishops etc.,



					[Exit de l. W., H.A.

1.	    Agricultural Policy.

83)	

P.M.	Farmers are showing anxiety.  I shd. perhaps say something at Margate.



T.D.	Any effort we make to help farmers, in a free-er economy, will leave them worse off than under existing system.

	Brought to a head now because in early weeks of de-control of cereals trade imported large quantities because of v. favourable oversea prices.



P.M.	Worse things than buying surplus grain for strategic stocks.

Mght be better to build food stocks &amp; cut down expenditure on anti-sub. &amp; mine defences.  Wd. enable you to honour guarantees to farmers w’out economic waste.



Ll.G.	Posn. isn’t serious.  As much is being bought off farmers as in corresp. period of 1948 &amp; other comparable years.



T.D.	More diff. ques is meat.  They fear we shall impose on them for meat a system similar to that for cereals.

	Want to discuss “principles” with N.F.U.’s on Monday.



H.C.	Is this a draft for discussion – or our last word.



T.D.	Wd. give it to them before Mon.  See then where diffes. exist.

Come back to Cab.



H.C.	Mtg. will therefore be for purpose of reaching agreement with them.



R.A.B.	There is a great crisis of confidence.

	Much can be done by presentn.

	Fact is tht. we shall put more on Budget for agric. subsidies. ; and we have not yet let them down on any commodity.



P.M.	Can’t change principle of guarantee w’out 3 years or so notice.



Ll.G.	There is no limit of time to the principle.  It’s a variation of method.



			Draft approval as basis for discussion with farmers.





1.	    University Franchise.

84)	

M.F.	Resoln. at Margate on Saty. calling on us to redeem our pledge.

	We all favour no return to plural voting.  But, w’out it, the University vote can’t be re-introduced for H/C.

	It is in fact impossible to restore this franchise.

	I wd. favour a Univ. Group in a reformed H/L.  But much diffce. of view on that.  Times leader to-day : pamphlet comes down, with regret, to concln. tht. there is no room for univ. repves. in either house.

	What do we say on Saty.? Air the diffies.?  Or let resoln. be passed, knowing we can’t implement it?



P.M.	No harm in allowing Conference to express view.  We can then consider wtr. it is practicable.

	Things have moved.  “One man, one vote” may not remain a sacred principle for ever.  We may have to face “fancy franchises”.



H.C.	Let some one be briefed to speak fr. the floor bringing out the diffies.  No Govt. spokesman.



W.	Cd. M-F. wind up the debate?



M-F.	No.  I shan’t be missed.





1.	    Iceland Fisheries.

85)	

			Memo approved.





1.	    G.A.T.T.					[Enter J. Foster



P.T.	If appln. goes to vote, like she wd. get in by 2/3rd. majority.  But we have some support in resisting her appln.  Want to keep that team together.  Secretariat are thinking of a compromise resoln. – as in telegram.  Advise support that, even at risk of being pressed to go further.  Gives us 9/10ths of what we want on commercial policy &amp; cd. be justified to U.K. public opinion.



A.E.	Don’t think you will get all our supporters to back the compromise.



P.T.	At least let me try.  I will keep in touch with A.E.





1.	    Wages Claim &amp; Industrial Disputes.

87)	

W.M.	Engineering claim will be rejected Wed.  There may be guerrilla strikes – or refusal to work piece-rates.  May be trouble.

	Strike in Lpl. Docks.  7-8,000 out.  Hope it won’t continue.
