C.C. 71 (53)				                                                         25th November, 1953



				                                         [Enter 3 Serv. Min., B-H., O.P.

138.	    Retired Pay of Service Officers.



B-H.	111 Member (76 Labour + 34 Tories) have signed a motion of protest v. Govt. decision.



P.M.	Shd. we take some action.



Al.	Believe it will get worse &amp; Govt. may be forced to make a concession.



P.M.	Shan’t yield to blackmail.  Many other “injustices” wh. might be remedied.

	If Govt. alter decn. solidly reached in face of this pressure, they will be seen to fail in duty to other members of community.  It wasn’t the cost, but the avalanche it wd. open.



R.A.B.	i) During Labour Govt., despite efforts at legn. in ’47 etc.,, no attempt made to deal with higher income cases.  Various Ministerial replies takg. same line.  They stood on “hardship” only – as we have tried to do.

	In our Act of ’52 we have limited ourselves to h’ship.

	ii) They profited by 3-4% until outbreak of war. Since 39/40 they have lost by consolidn. at ’35 rate.  On balance, they have lost by it.  C.S. have lost even more.

	Sufficient pol. feeling to warrant some action.  First, explain our case –

        	  |	outside H/C to avoid hasty vote.  I am ready to put our case to

	x|	private Members.  Make it clear we can’t extend to other classes.

		Second, only concession :  express hope tht. in future we may be able to do it – indicatg. tht. it is a strong case.  Imply – if &amp; when other things can be done.



A.E.	You cdn’t escape repercussions e.g. disabled.   When you can deal with that, you cd. clear this too.



M.F.	Decision was right.  Can’t climb down now.  Support x/.



R.A.B.	But wait a bit because they are insolent.  They need discipline.



P.M.	Dangerous to let 1922 Cttee. meet to-morrow w’out hearing the case.

Wd. prefer quick action.



B.H.	Support P.M.’s view.  Must get atmosphere right.

Cdn’t get Judges Bill next week in this state of feeling.



J.S.	If you want to check this &amp; get no more names added to Motion, you must explain it to-morrow.



			Agreed :   Explain to 1922 Cttee. to-morrow: R.A.B. accompanied by A.E.

          Widen it up – by refce. to precarious economic

           situation.



P.M.	Not quite convinced tht.  C. Servants have same claim.



O.L.	A strong case but not the same case.



O.P.	This wd. be worst moment to make concession.  Timing :  Shd. do it when comparable concession is being made to war pensioners &amp; o.a.p.  Either earlier, when we did, or later, when we hope to do more for them.



R.A.B.	To bring all occupational pensions up to current rates wd. cost £40 millions.



P.M.	Stand firm &amp; let it be known there is no ques of any change of policy – tho’ policy includes hope tht. circs. may arise in future when this claim cd. be met.

	Will be known tht. this was subject of Cab. Mtg. this morning.  Let Press be told above.



R.A.B.	Am having routine mtg. with Lobby this p.m.  Shall say we are explaining reasons to supporters to-morrow :  m’while no more to be said.





1.	    Parliament.

140)	

A.E.	P.Q.’s to-day may give rise to adjournment requests – because Left Wing Socialists who wanted F.A. Debate before B’muda.



H.C.	Cab. agreed to Judges Bill next week.  Can’t do it now.

Pity I deferred to RAB’s judgment.  If I hadn’t, we shd. have got it past already.



			Agreed :  Judges Bill to be p’poned.

					[Exit O.P.



1.	    Uganda.

141)	

O.L.	New developmt. not heard.



P.M.	Think it wd. make it more diff. for O.L. to allow him to come here.

H.C.	Surely wrong to suppress right of personal appeal to S of S.



A.E.	You aren’t going to do that :  if he wants to come, he can?



O.L.	Govr. won’t agree to his coming here while ques remains open.

	Cd. send him a personal message.  Am against sending M/State out – mustn’t crawl.



Sal.	“Appeal” implies tht. decision has bn. taken.  If it were unsuccessful no harm then in not sending him back to Uganda.



P.M.	More trouble if you bring him over here.



			Agreed :  Handle it w’out bringing him to U.K.
