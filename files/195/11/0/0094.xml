C.C. 11 (54)					24th February, 1954



						[Enter B-H

171.	    Queen’s Tour: Gibraltar.



P.M.	Govr’s statement contains various things he shd. not have said.

	V. serious concern if Spaniards welcomed into Gib. for Queen’s visit.  They are v. excitable people.

	O.L. has called him home for consultn.



O.L.	His statement that frontier won’t be closed needed detailed examinn. before any public statement was made.



P.M.	Bravado at Queen’s expense.





1.	    Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Defence Debate.  2/3  P.M. to open.

	3/3 Supply:  Industrial Situation (excluding wages).





1.	    Television.



H.C.	This week saw leaders of 2 Opposn. Parties.  Repd. it as semi-constitutional issue.  Wd. we like to confer, to avoid Party controversy.  Became clear they wd. accept 2nd. Corpn. financed by increased licence fees tho’ by Ty. (capital &amp; revenue) for first few years.  We have rejected that already.

	M.F., PMG &amp; I saw them on this occasion.

	Propose to reply tht. we cdn’t support that plan :  not workable : must use advertising as main source of revenue.

	Tho’ we will say we cd. reach agreemt. with them on religion &amp; politics.





1.	    Raw Materials: Tungsten.



W.	State trading in tungsten will cease on 1/4. 

		This is the last, save only jute.

		Will be announced next week - ? Mon. – by H. Amory.





1.	    Teachers Superannuation.



P.M.	Delay – leave it for the massacre at end/session.



F.H.	Times Ed. Suppl. support us.

	I’m being asked if we are going to run out – awkward for Members who support us now.



B.H.	Gt. majority of our supporters want to go on:  &amp; will make trouble if we do abandon it. 



Sw.	Handling Press.  



F.H.	Press generally supports us, if we are firm.



R.A.B.	On merits no doubt.  N.U.T. expect us to do this.  If not passed we shall need suppl. in July.  Taxpayers will then know that it’s a teachers’ ramp.



F.H. &amp; J.S.	L.a.’s support the schemes.



P.M.	Not so sure of merits.  Depends on actuarial calculns. – wh. I don’t much like.



R.A.B.	We must go on with this, at appropriate time.

		Suggest we consider, in smaller gathering, how we handle it tactically.

		RAB., with F.H., J.S., Ch. Whip.

			                                               [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers. O.P.



1.	    Retired Pay of Service Officers.

177)	

Sw.	Memo. covers Indian Army Officers not I.C.S.  We shall have to do same for Indian civilians as for Home civilians.



Al.	V. wise plan.  Will remove a gt. grievance.



R.A.B.	Will be raised on Service Estimates – that’s why I circulated it now.

		If it is unlikely to be raised on Air Estimates, we cd. defer announcemt. until Army Estimates.



P.M.	If I am to announce Service pay increases on 2/3, shd. I not mention this too?  If I don’t, it will spoil effect of pay increases.



O.P.	Pressure from war pensioners etc., Shd. like an opportunity to spk. on this.



P.M.	Want a memo. from you on o.a.p. future generally.



O.P.	Cttee. sitting :  won’t report until end/year.

	Wd. like this concession coupled with £1/2 M concession on v. severely disabled.



P.M.	Want memo. before Phillips reports.



R.A.B.	Can I see O.P. this p.m.  Report to Cab. Friday.  Genl. statement by P.M. on 2/3 – with Wh. Paper to follow later in the day.

					[Exit O.P., B.H.



1.	    Civil Defence Training.



M.F.	As in memo.

	Importance of this – C.D. policy i) local part-time service under l.a.’s ii) mobile columns centrally directed.  We have raised i). We have had only one experimental column for one year. under (ii).  We are rightly criticised for this.



P.M.	Cole’s speech shows how right I was to stop works on underground accommodn.



M.F.	Must however hedge v. conventional attack

	Anyhow, this doesn’t effect need for mobile columns.

	We shd. announce this in Def. Debate – to forestall criticism.

	Will need a simple Bill – to authorise C.D. training during Nat. Service.



H.C.	No promise shd be given re date of legn.

					[Exit AH., de L.

					[Enter ALB.

1.	    East-West Trade:  Shipping.



P.T.	We agree to embargo all ships over 15 knots.

	     ..    ..   outside that no quantitative control.

	     ..   ..    m’while we shd. continue in Paris group to get extended trade under existing policy.



J.T.	We are ready to discuss in Paris group.

	Propose we accept orders up to 30,000 t in any year, and continue in Paris to press for a larger quota.



RAB.	Shd. we not have timed it to follow other talks with U.S.



P.T.	Cdn’t.  Must talk in Paris group.  M’while we need the orders.



Sw.	Doesn’t prejudice our general position.



A.L.B.	We welcome this.



			Approved.













1.	    Royal Tour : Homecoming.			[Exit J.T., ALB.

				      [Enter D.E., A.E.



D.E.	Ld. Ch. has submitted proposals difft. fr. earlier occasions.  They contain more ceremony and display.  Ld. Mayor &amp; Corpn. will go in barge to Pool of London.  Bridges above the Pool will be decorated.

	Ques therefore of co-ordinating scale of decorns. by various authies.

	My estimate does not include provn. for restoring damage in Parks.



P.M.	Summers P.Q. re bills.  Seems quite a good idea.



R.A.B.	I wasn’t consulted.  Don’t want a Supplementary.  Shd. be w’in 1954/5 Estimates.  £8 or £10,000 has covered 7/8 day visits of  French President.



L.P.	Bon-fires throughout the country wd. be good &amp; inexpensive.



			Approve in principle.

			D.E. to discuss details with R.A.B.

			L.P. to consult Cantuar re bills.



					[Exit D.E.

1.	    Betting and Lotteries.



M.F.	You suggd. a canter in H/L.  This indicates line tht. a Govt. spokesman mght then take.

	Corruptn. in Leeds Police – v. serious.  Counsel has said he wdn’t be able to rely on evidence of a Leeds Police witness in a criminal case.

	R. Commn. reported 4 years ago.

	Penultimate para. of draft statement.



P.M.	Look at the Opposn. – bookmakers plus Church assocns. v. gambling.

		Don’t offer to break your neck over it.

		The argument is the same as for maisons tolerées.



M.F.	But corruption of Police is v. serious matter.  Has bn. going on for 30 years and is now on a v. serious scale.  Leeds Police admitted to R. Commn. tht. they don’t attempt to enforce the law.



P.M.	Don’t get too far ahead of public opinion.



A.E.	We can look at it again in light of H/L. discussion.



			Memo. approved.

			subject to omission of specific mention of Leeds Police – lest we seem to be generalising too much from a particular              case.





1.	    Delegated Legislation.



H.C.	First recommn. was unanimous.  Opposn. are likely to support it.

		Some of our Members don’t like it because wd. prevent us fr. filibustering in Opposn.  But they can’t use this argument in public.  And both parties have pretty well exhausted this particular tactic of obstruction.

	Recommend we try this experimentally for rest of this Session – by a Sessional Order.

	The other recommendns. are of lesser importance.



J.S.	Support these recommns.

	V. awkward to keep a House late for these.



				Memo. approved.





1.	    Visiting Forces Act.



M.F.	Delayed so tht. we can give assurance of reciprocal treatment.

	Propose to apply it to all N.A.T.O. countries wh. have ratified Agreemt.

	Can’t promise there won’t be trouble in H/C.  Detailed immunities.

		But I’m pressed to bring it in because at present U.S. Forces have an exclusive jurisdn. : this will bring them under concurrent jurisdn.

	This is the time to do it.



A.E.	We have bn. criticised for not doing it earlier.

	The U.S. point is important – and used by those who want to make mischief  betwn. us and U.S.

	The sooner we regularise posn., the better.





1.	    Sexual Offences.



M.F.	Prostitution :  annoyance and 40/= maximum :  couldn’t get law amended without an authoritative enquiry.

	Homosexuality.

		While crime generally has doubled, these offences have risen 41/2 times.  Some think [existg] law shd. be limited to protn. of young and public indecency.  I don’t agree:  homos. make a nuisance of themselves.  But admit I can’t account for this increase.



P.M.	Tory Party won’t want to accept responsibility for makg. law on homosexuality more lenient – or for maisons tolerées.

	But, w’out enquiry – i) could we not limit publicity for homosexuality, as was done for divorce?

ii) persons convicted shd. have opportunity to apply for medical treatment.

	Otherwise, I wdn’t touch the subject.  Let it get worse – in hope of a more united public pressure for some amendment.



Sw.	i) might be tried by Private Members Bill under 10 min. rule.  The divorce legn. began on that basis.



O.L.	There is also the case for amending law re prostitn.  On that there is a case for enquiry. 



R.A.B.	London is a public scandal.  Cd. we not try to deal with that, w’out enquiry.  E.g. by increasing penalties.



Sal.	Course i) wd. not command unqualified support.  Some say tht. publicity is a deterrent.  But you cd. get ques ventilated by such a Bill ;  and Govt. cd. decide after discn.

	Winterton has suggd. motion in H/L.  I have discouraged him for the time.  But he will revert to it, if we don’t make any statement.



M.F.	Immedte. legn.  Diffy. is tht. Women’s Societies wd. make an issue of it.  That’s why I wanted to be strengthened by enquiry.

		If it is thght tht. R.C. is too heavy, Dpt. Cttee. wd. meet me.



F.H.	Confirmed tht. Woman’s Societies wd. oppose any legn. – wh. they wd. represent as unfairness to women.



M_F.	Let us turn it over in our minds and discuss again the ques of 

an enquiry.

	

P.M.	Remember that we can’t expect to put the whole world right 

		with a majority of 18.





1.	    Industrial Disputes.     a) Engineering.

185)	

W.M. 	Rpt. of Court of Enquiry will be publd. on Friday.

	Good on the whole.  Too much weight to basic rates.

i)	improvmts. in structure &amp; machinery to be explored.

ii)	wider enquiry into effect of wages on national economy e.g. a standing Cttee.

iii)	some increase this year :  parties to negotiate : somethg. like a third of the claim.  That wd. be about 7/=.

iv)	

				b) Docks.



	Trouble brewg. seeing 2 sides to-morrow.  Will delay imports.

	It’s on ques wtr or not over-time shd. be voluntary.
