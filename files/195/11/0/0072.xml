C.C. 67 (53)				                                                         17th November, 1953



110.	    Atomic Energy.

					[Enter D.S.

P.M.	M/S. will be responsible until1/1.  D.E. cdn’t answer yet.



D.S.	To-day’s P.Q. are not, however, atomic energy matters but f. policy on disarmament.



P.M.	Must make early statement explaining principles on wh. P.Q.’s will be distributed.





1.	    Royal Visit.

			

H.C.	Will give notice to day of Address.

	Read terms of draft – subject to Palace approval.



P.M.	Approved.  I will move it in H/C.





112.	    Atomic Energy (contd.).

		

P.M.	Read message from Cherwell.

	Wd. have like to bring it back from B’muda.

	V. satisfactory.





113.	    Trieste.

			

A.E.	Yugoslavs will come to confce. on condn. tht. no transfer to Italians in Zone A takes place m’while.  Ital. wdn’t accept on that basis.

	That is now only diffy. out-standing.  But we may get round it, &amp; bring them to a mtg.

	Better than it was.



1.	    Egypt.

		

A.E.	Two messages from U.S.  First : when will we make a move? Impertinent.  Said I wdn’t accept it.  For I had told them the next move was with E.

			Second :  they want resume economic aid to E.  They stopped aid to Israel because Quibya &amp; have now resumed it.  Want therefore to do somethg for an Arab State.  Shall tell U.S. Amb. to-day they mustn’t do this.  With Cab. authy.



			Agreed.



					[Enter A.H. &amp; de L.





1.	    Jordan.

		

A.E.	Will suspend more of squadron until Sec. Council dispose of Quibya incident.

	What else shd. we do?  Now, or in event of attack.  Shd. we discuss with Jordan.  Is any despatch of troops by us a sedative or a provocation in this area?  We cd. tell Israel we don’t intend it to be used v. them &amp; at same time tht. we have Treaty with J – a balanced statement.



Al.	I wd. send no troops in while there is a risk of trouble.  Don’t want them mixed up in it.



A.E.	Jordan won’t attack Israel.  Our men wd. therefore be deterrent to violence, which will come only fr. Israel.

	* We cd. discuss situation in event of attack.



Al.	Yes : for if Israel attacked they wd. over-run Jordan so fast we cdn’t help them.



A.H.	Don’t want to send a battn.  Wdn’t be enough to do any good, if trouble started.



A.E. 	* V. well.  Rely on squadron for deterrent.



P.M.	Fear becomg. involved in war with Israel.



A.E.	Chances of I. attack on J. wd. be increased if they knew we wdn’t honour our Treaty.

	* But I will work out terms of warning statement to Israel, and submit 

	it to Cabinet.



P.M.	Don’t want even to honour this Treaty oblign.  Cd. we not in event go running to U.N.



A.E.	What about our Iraq Treaty.



M-F.	Tho’ I am Zionist, I support A.E.’s original plan because I think it wd. have a steadying effect.  Can’t ignore the open sore betwn. Arabs &amp; Jews &amp; risk tht. it may explode on an incident.



Al.	Won’t go off by accident :  it will be planned by I. Govt.  Tho’ Quibya was not planned.



P.M.	We cd. ask U.S. at B’muda what their policy is to be in reln. to pacificn. of Israel/Arab situation.



			Agreed : A.E. to work out  { warning to I.

			                                           { statement	for J. if we send mil.



de L.	Aircraft wd. be badly exposed, as no early warning system.



A.E.	Inclined to send 1 squadron for training, when Quibya is finished in U.N., and add to that warning to Israel re Treaty.

					[Exit A.H. &amp; de L.

					[Enter J.T. &amp; Molson

1.	    East-West Trade.

			

A.E.	Two courses.

iv)	continue with system as now, trying to whittle down list gradually.  U.S. wd. go along with that.

v)	try for agreement on a short list. B/T. and Ty. want a v. short list :  M/D a longer one.  But how cd. we get U.S. to accept a really short list?  Tho’ incln. of electrical machinery wd. decrease out existg. trade.

117)	My preference is for i) because I don’t believe we can persuade U.S. to accept ii).  Whichever we choose, we must introduce transaction controls.

118)	

Al.	Object was to get v. long U.S. list shorter.  Diffce. btw. me &amp; Ty. is not therefore v. important.  Electronics etc., are vital to modern war.  But don’t doubt we in U.K. cd. arrive at agreed list to use as lever on U.S.



O.L.	Electrical machinery is much too wide a catergory – includes much matter of peaceful trade.

	Support course (i).



O.L.	War potential criterion goes much too wide.



P.T.	El. machinery wd. cut out 50% of our trade to R., as at now.

	Hope we shall try to get agreemt. on some short list, and start talking to U.S. on that basis.



P.M.	But that means starting fr. opposite end to U.S.



R.A.B.	This is one of our few chances to increase exports.  Unless we do we can’t m’tain our defence effort.  Avoid head-on collision with U.S., but press them as far as we can.

	Prefer therefore approach of P.T.



H.C.	Shall have to consult Doms. on a short list before we put it to Paris because Canada only Dom. represented there.



P.T.	Go for a short list :  seek inter-deptl. agreement on it before Paris mtg. starts on 10/12.

	Transaction controls.  We must do this.  But bargain it v. a shorter list.  Tactfully.





1.	    Transatlantic Cable.

					[Enter PMG.

			Approved.





1.	    Television.

			                                                        [Enter Gammons &amp; B.H.



D.	Reith has given notice of Motion in H/L. on 25/11.



RAB.	A good Press on the whole.  Tho’ some will say new corpn. shd. not be financed by advertising.



W.	Wanted 1st. discn. in H/C.  But can’t get Reith to defer.  And they will force a division.  Hal., Waverley &amp; Brand support R.

May be out-voted.  Hendriks thinks we shall win.



P.M.	Wdn’t it be easier (for me) if we were beaten in H/L.



G.	In H/C. there won’t be much diffy. fr. our supporters.



B-H.	That may be right.  But Whips can’t yet give a firm opinion, based on systematic enquiry.

	Won’t help us if it’s debated in H/L. first.

	We cdn’t get a debate in H/C. w’in 2 wks after Wh. Paper.  Socialists wdn’t accept earlier debate.



H.C.	Awkward, if H/L. defeats Wh. Paper, when Bill comes to them.



D.	Younger Tories in H/L. may now support our plan.



					[Exit Gamm. PMG.

1.	    Engineering Strike.

			

W.M.	They will carry (Thurs.) plan for 24-hour strike.

	Better than immediate notice, or ban on over-time of piece-work.

	Don’t know what they’ll do after the strike.





1.	    Serving Officers’ Retired Pay.

			

??	Am v. hard-pressed in Parlt.  Early action.  Can’t wait.  Some link it with Judges’ salaries.  Others with Army Estimates.  Delay will cost more than we need have paid some months ago.



			Agreed.  Thursday (RAB)
