C.C. 42(53).				13th July, 1953.



	Washington Talks.



	a)	Germany : Four Power Meeting.	[Enter  S.Ll., B-H.



R.A.B.	Have spoken to P.M.



S.Ll.	U.S. &amp; Fr. want somethg. diff. fr. P.M.’s Heads of State project.

		New factor is Adenauer’s pressure, on electoral grds., for

		early 4-Power Mtg on Germany.  Our attitude of last Sept : 

		Commn. on facts, free elections, Peace Treaty.  Commn. to 

		create condns. for free elections is first step.

	If we don’t accept, we shall be alone.  Lesser evil is to fall in.

                   x/	Risk : U.S. &amp; Fr. will play for failure:  then go on with E.D.C. 

	Try for understandings.  (i) No more U.S. sops to Germans before 

		the elections.  (ii) Fr. must undertake tht., whatever result of

		talks, they will go on with some plan for integratg. G. with

		W. Europe.



R.A.B.	P.M. agrees tht. x/ is risk.  But, even so, must go on.  Don’t commit 

		ourselves to form – keep open attendance of Heads of State, 

		&amp; also agenda.

	Can’t avoid it.  Better this than no mtg.  Keep open agenda &amp; 

		attendance.



Sw.	Good to have got U.S. to accept a mtg. at all.

	We can’t resist : as it was our wish to have a mtg.

	Cd always expand subjects for discn. – if only informally.

	Gives us lever to secure U.S. co-opn. on Egypt.



Ch.	Can’t avoid it.  Public won’t realise difft. character of mtg.



M.F.	Endorse paras. 7 &amp; 14.



R.A.B.	Keep alive to para. 2 of W’ton 1472.



H.C.	Suppose R. want to widen agenda : &amp; U.S. &amp; Fr. decline.



Sw.	V. diff. for Fr. &amp; U.S. to hang back then.



O.L.	WD. offer some chance of unexpected re-action fr. R. because their 

		internal posn.



R.A.B.	Can we suggest larger agenda?



W.	Heads of State cd. widen it, if they attended, w’out advance agreemt? 



P.T.	Cdn’t. have full-scale 4 Power talks w’out P.M.

	At limited mtg. we shall (⅔rds. of us) be playing to lose.  Gt.

		disappointmt. to world opinion.  Care therefore not to play up

		now the agreemt. to hold 4-Power.



Sw.	Will inform Doms.



O.L.	Later consider our line – including P.T.’s point.		Agreed.





	b)	Egypt.                                  [Enter  C.O.S., A.H., Wm. Strang.



S.Ll.	Dulles’ action must be deplored.  Essential to avoid i) allowing U.S.

                A/		to become intermediary  ii) negotiating on basis of N.’s offer.

	N.’s offer is unacceptable.  No concession save on nos. of technicians.

		Can’t accept 1. a or b.  c.d.e.:  2 a) &amp; b : 3 a) are all O.K.  3 b)

		(period) is unacceptable : so is 3 (c).  4. b. gives no security of 

		tenure.  5. – “allies of E.’s allies” widens it a bit : but attack on 

		Arab nation is much too narrow:  and E. decides what is a threat.

		6. a. bring in all sorts of nations.

	Prepd. draft reply on above basis.



RAB.	Add to that draft reversion to Cab. draft re re-activation of the base.



C.N.S.	S.Ll. have covered all our points.	Agreed.

		Add : Tel. 1469.  N.’s message.  We welcome last sentence on

		first page.  But it accords ill with his proposals.



C.I.G.S.	I. e. of N. 6 plan.  Must get it clear tht. action proceeds while 

		argument proceeds.



J.S.	A, B. &amp; C.  Do we accept routing thro’ Base Commr.



C.I.G.S.	Wd. be non-operational instns.  And we shd. keep a private line.



RAB.	Wd create a bad impression on our public.  But wd. be less sinister if

		we had our men in uniform etc.,



C.I.G.S.	Our man must be clearly i/c of Br. materiel &amp; personnel.	Agreed:

		stress it in our reply.



R.A.B.	P.M.	has assented to A/.  Will prob. accept F.O. draft on detail.



Sw.	Festing’s ultimatum.



Al.	9/7. p.m. R. went to hotel in Ismailia, where accosted by E. offr. and

		criminal &amp; taken away.  Believed now in Cairo.  Believed to 

		have given signed statement asking for asylum.



Sw.	Can this be played down in Press?  W.O. &amp; M/D. to concert this.



Al.	Support Festing’s firm stand.



	c)	Persian Gulf.



S.Ll.	U.S. pressing us to accept solution wh. will leave T. in Buraimi.  We

		can’t agree:  he wd. intrigue &amp; our prestige wd. be impaired.

		Can’t go beyond our line : both sides to w’draw.



Al.	Don’t believe Ibu Saud will agree.



Ch.	Do we risk a row with U.S. over this.



S.Ll.	Believe Saudis wd. accept if Eisenhower pressed him.



Al.	Compromise : cd. you leave T. in Buraimi but subject to blockade.



S.Ll.	He wd. continue to stir up trouble if left there.

	What is at stake is our influence in this area.



A.H.	Wd. prefer agreemt. with U.S. over this, when we have so much more

		important things to get U.S. support on.



S.Ll.	Large incomes of the small oil chiefs.



R.A.B.	Try this once more.  But don’t risk a row with U.S.  We may have to

		re-consider later – after S. has left.





	2.	Coal Production.		[Enter  G.Ll.



	Cabinet approved, with amendments, draft announcement of decision

		to import large coal.

					[Exit  G.Ll.



	3.	Regency.



	Agreed:	Defer to autumn.        {  R.A.B. to inform P.M.

			                                   {  M-F. to advise Queen.
