C.C. 62(53).				29th October, 1953.



	1.	Cabinet.	[Enter  J.B-C., B-H.



P.M.	Ch.’s last mtg.  Thanks for all help, in so many fields, over 2 yrs.

		Not only in science – also Robot!

	Will continue to give personal advice.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	D/Address:  hope to finish in 6 days, by Tues-week.  Recently has

		bn. only 5.





	3.	Regency Bill.



M-F.	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



	Timetable.  i)  C.R.O. must give Doms 48 hrs.’ notice – also your 

			               reply in moving address in reply to Message.

			      This means Queen’s approval of Message must be 

			               obtd. Frid.

		Message to be brought on 4/11.  By precedent, P.M. brings it :

		Spker. reads it :  P.M. moves Address in reply &amp; adds a few 

		words re introdn. of Bill.  Present Bill 5/11.  2nd. Rdg. 11 or 

		12/11.

		Try to get all stages in one day :  if not, complete on 16/11.



			Agreed :  Doms. to be informed.





	4.	British Guiana.



P.M.	Arrests w’out charges.  Feared trouble in H/C. – tho’ none has 

		matured.  Don’t like this sort of thing w’out bloodshed, as in

		Kenya &amp; Malaya.



O.L.	Cab. Minutes recognised tht. Ministers left at large might stir up 

		trouble:  &amp; cd. not be left to flout our authy. before eyes of world.

	I advised Govr. tht. I wd. prefer restraint on movement vice arrest.

		But he became satisfied tht. they were organising resistance, 

		holdg illegal mtgs etc.,  And in the end I authorised him to

		arrest, as he wished to do.

	One prosecution launched – but no witnesses turned up.

	Am telling Govr. he can’t detain indefinitely.  He must see how he

		can get witnesses into court, administratively.  But intimidation

		is severe &amp; w’spread.

				[Exit  Ch.  Enter  A.E.



O.L.	Shd. I see Jagen &amp; Burgan?  I think I shd.  They will have grievance,

		and exploit it, if I refuse.



P.M.	I wdn’t do so.  But you can do as you please.



O.L.	Wd. like views of Cabinet.



M.F.	I wd. see both Opposn. &amp; Jagan.



L.P.S.	So wd. I.



Sal.	And I.

			Agreed :  see them.





	5.	Jordan.



A.E.	Move is to Man – 100 m. N.E. of Aquaba.  It is not like a move

		to Amman or to Israel frontier. – fr. pt. of view of provocn.,  in

		light of latest Isr/J. row.  Israelis were told some days ago.



P.M.	Feared Israelis will relate it to latest inflammation.  But I see it’s a

		long way from frontier.



A.E.	Just heard M’batten is on his way to Amman.  Must restrain him.,

		if I verify he didn’t give notice to F.O.



				         [Enter  A.H.

	6.	Home Guard.



Al.	Needs thought :  wd. sooner review it with R. Review.

	Real role for H.G.  If emergency were nearer, we shd. get recruits

		needed.  Must therefore keep skeleton.  Greater need for H.G. in

		next war than in last – aid to civil power under atomic attack.

	M’while get full value for the cost of £1M. p.a.



A.H.	At end of 2 yr. period we must say we are going on, or give it up.  And

		a strong lead will be necessary if we are to avoid a run-down.

	Politically it wd. be v. diff. to reverse policy on this.

	Strategically, Home Forces think it has an important role.

	Have to take a firm line in answer to P.Q. next week.



M-F.	Decn. to abandon H.G. wd. be damaging to C.D. recruiting etc.,



P.M.	No doubt.  Continue it.  And announce this with determination.

					[Exit  A.H.



	7.	Meat Marketing.



P.M.	Two mtgs of Ministers on 27 and 28/10.

	Alternatives :  go fwd. with this plan or abandon our general policy.

	RAB. suggested enquiry if this was thght too big a risk to take.

		But tht. wd. involve continuance of State trading for another

		year.



Ll.G.	Accept draft memo.



T.D.	Ques of presentation.  Para. 16 is my difficulty.  Last sentence :  I wd.

		prefer to be more forthcoming.  Wd. like to invite farmers to put

		fwd. scheme &amp; promise them assistance.



Ll.G.	Minister must act in judicial capacity on a scheme.  Can he promise to

		assist them?



T.D.	May I discuss form of words with M/F. &amp; submit for P.M. decision.

		[E.g.  Put the invitation before a) and b) :  Generally agreed.



O.L.	Para 12.  New terminology – avoid “def. paymt” wh. farmers dislike.

		Can’t we call it a dual price policy or something like that?



A.E.	Endorse that suggn.



O.L.	Dual-price system with collective &amp; individual guarantees.



Sal.	Para. 16.  If there are to be more Bds. than one, use plural.



T.D.	Milk Bd. is crucial.

	Under Agr. M. Acts, Ag. Ministers have complete power of dirn.

		to Bds.



Ll.G.	V. Important.  Increased use of heat-treatment etc.,  Trades must be

		consulted :  leave loop-hole for that.  M.M. Bd. wd. accept that.



T.D.	I have permanent powers under M.M. Acts.  M/F. has power only

		under D.R.



F.H.	Wd. wish School milk service to be taken over by M.M.B.



			Agreed :  Ministers to discuss details on milk.



	Timetable.



T.D.	First discuss with Govt. supporters.



B.H.	Tuesd. p.m. – mtg. with Agric. Cttee.   R.A.B. – with M/Ag. and M/F.



P.M.	Ministers concerned shd. work out time-table –

		L.P.S. to preside in R.A.B.’s absence.  H.M. &amp; B-H.

		to attend.
