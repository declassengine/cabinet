C.C. 65(53).				10th November, 1953.



	1.	Trieste.		[Enter  P.B-H.



A.E.	U.S. suggest we make the approach but add tht., in view of 

		disorders, we make no move to appoint Ital. to admve. posts in T.

		until order is restored.

	This is a satisf. compromise.  We can accept.





	2.	Bermuda Meeting.



P.M.	Arrangemts. now accepted by French and U.S.

	Leakage in to-day’s Press.

	Official announcement at 2 p.m. to-day.  Will mention it in H/C. also.





	3.	Cost of Living :  Food Prices.



P.M.	Understood tht. food prices had increased.  Ministers tell me it isn’t so.

		But will be an issue in bye-elections.  We shd. state it firmly.

		Beginning in H/C. to-day.



Ll.G.	£1.800M is spent on tobacco, drink &amp; entertainment.  More than

		double the level of 30’s before re-armament.





	4.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Judges’ Salaries Bill :  2nd. Rdg. Wedy.



R.A.B.	Thought we were going to defer that until salaries of Members and

		Ministers had reached stage of decision.



H.C.	Was on Paper all last Session.  Argument tht. Judges are sui generis

		will be spoilt if you relate it to Ministers etc., And Opposn. is

		fairly co-operative over it now.



A.E.	Gt. opposition among Tories in country twds. any increase of M.P.’s

		salaries.  No reason to believe that Party will support it.



Sim.	Strongest argument for Judges’ Bill is sui generis claim.  Don’t want to

		see that spoiled.



H.C.	Suggest p’ponement for one week.  take Cotton Bill  or Ind. Diseases

		instead.  M’while by-elections will be over, and we can take

		further soundings re attitude of Lab. Party re Judges.



R.A.B.	If we separate the issues, I believe we shall have to defer increases

		in Ministers’ salaries.  Which I wd. deplore.



J.S.	Ministers &amp; M.P.’s cd. go together.  But Judges separately.

				[Enter  J.T., V.C.N.S.,

				            Profumo.

	5.	East-West Trade.



P.T.	In Paris group, all countries save U.S. are content.

	No strategic risk :  we need the orders :  if we don’t take them,

		others will.

	Recommendn. – as in para. 9.



A.E.	Accept time-limit.  Ask for i) 18/11, not 14th.  Gives time for U.S. to

		reply and ii) Cab. to consider any repns. made.



			Agreed :  subject to i) and ii).	

		                                                             [Exit J.T., C.N.S., &amp; Profo.

			                                                    [Enter  Solr. Genl.

	6.	International Tin Agreement.



W.	Trying for buffer stock plan.  WD. be to our advantage.  Unlikely to

		get agreemt.  But, if we do, wd. like H.Q. in Ldn.

	Want therefore exemptn. for it fr. income tax on its transactions, and

		on contns. by Malaya, and Nigeria.



R.A.B.	Concede it, for personnel, only in last resort.



O.L.	Certainly.



Solr.G.	Leave open ques. of O-in-C ;  for ques is being tested in courts on

		Raw Cotton Commn.



			                     Agreed.                [Exit  Solr. G.

			                                                  [Enter  PMG. &amp; Gammans.



	7.	Television Policy.



P.M.	Proposed answer to D. Jay’s P.Q.



P.M.	Draft para.  “If Parlt. so wills” implies too clearly a free vote.

		Better say :  “it is for further consn. wtr ….. shd. be w’drawn.”

		That is more normal language - &amp; still leaves it open.    Agreed.



H.C.	What wd. be posn. of Ministers, in Cab. and outside, if there is a free

		Vote?



P.M.	Ministers are entitled to consciences as well as back-Benchers.



O.L.	But Cab. are all agreed tht. religion &amp; politics cd. not be excluded.



R.A.B.	Uncertainty on this isn’t going to be helpful.

	Still prefer excln. at outset, on B.B.C. precedent.

	But that cd. emerge from this wording.

	Only weakness:  will appear tht. we don’t know our own mind.

	Shd. we say :  “The case for w’drawing earlier ban either at

                  x/		once or after a period of testing the new arrangemts.  The 

		Govt, will therefore put fwd. proposals for allowing b’casting

		on their topics…….”



			General support for x/.  This wd. leave it open to

			us to allow a free vote on this issue.
