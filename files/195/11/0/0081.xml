C.C. 79(53).				15th December, 1953.



	1.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.	[Enter  B.H., S.Ll.



P.M.	Price paid on natn. was larger than shareholders wd. have recd.

		Rlways started with this as a mill-stone.  They can’t carry

		full burden.  Hope Ty. will consider relief of this load – not a 

		positive subsidy.  Why not transfer half to Natl. Debt?  If you

		announced that, Rlway. Tribunal cd. re-adjust wages accordingly.

		Wd. be easy &amp; dramatic way of avertg. strike.



R.A.B.	We discussed this earlier.  Load on rlways is less than before :

		£30M. (3%) is a lesser liability :  may have bn. £45M. before

		(fixed interest &amp; dividends).

	We can’t m’tain tht. natn. landed them with mill-stone.

	Have, however, considered wtr. other means can be found of 

		equiv of subsidy.  Puttg. it on Nat. Debt wd. be above 

		line in Budget – wd. be tantamount to subsidy.  We shd. be doing

		what has got French economy into such diffies. – subsidising

		wages fr. Exchequer.

	Will, however, go on considerg. this.



O.L.	Will be argued tht. in makg. comparison you shd. exclude dividends –

		which were variable.



W.	Shd. have both sets of figures.



H.M.	Revision of out-of-date rate system may provide an opening in

		long term.



W.M.	B.T.C. (seen this a.m.) have prepd. *difft. version of last para., which

		I shall put to N.U.R. this P.M. 4 o’clock.

	B.R. says :  if strike occurs, it will be well supported.

			some increase must be given to lower-paid (earning 

			£8 p.wk.) bound to happen.

	*If that proposal were accepted B.T.C. ….. as before …... B.T.C. will

		start by hearing case of lower-paid :  begin before Xmas &amp; press 

		on quickly.

	Will take a long time to negotiate.

	B.R. says any settlement will cost a lot - £10 M. or more :  and no way

		of finding it immediately.  Increased efficiency is long-term.



P.M.	Still favour adding £1.000 M. to Nat. Debt. and clear rlways of the 

		past.



R.A.B.	Wd. just put £30 M. on Budget above the line.



H.M.	Don’t wipe it all out :  give moratorium to enable BTC. to do what

		they shd. have begun 5 yrs. or more ago.



RAB.	Beware of coal history.  Also precedent for any natd. industry.





	2.	Television Policy.                                 [Enter  PMG., Gammans.



M.F.	Two ques principle  i)   brk. BBC. monopoly.

			               ii)  revenue fr. advts. for competg. cos.

	If H/C. accepts these, we will consider any detailed suggns. :  but must

		have decn. on these, wh. are fundamental to Govt.’s plan.

	Can’t finish this debate by re-opening whole issue.  Can get our vote.

		Offer to discuss details on Bill.

	Reject H. Morrison’s plea on that basis.



R.A.B.	Must decide pol. issue first.	Agreed.





	3.	Egypt.



B.H.	B.R. will meet at ALB.’s house to-night, 10 of the hard core.

                    x/	Larger mtg. Wed. – at St Stephen’s Club.  Alex. to address,

		(L.P.S. in Chair) A.H. to attend.  Invitns. to 30/40 of Waterhouse

		group &amp; a few from F.A. group.

	But Waterhouse says a motion may go down to-night.



P.M.	Don’t think that will do much harm.  A.E. doesn’t mind.

		No crime unless they vote in favour of it.

	Don’t make it condn. of mtgs tht. they shd. not table motion.



B.H.	Have only asked wtr it wdn’t do to put it down to-morrow.



R.A.B.	Not sure A.E. does like the motion.



B.H.	Keeps telephong. fr. Paris.



B.H.	Assume tht. we at least want as few names to it as possible.

		That is what I’m aiming at.  Is that what you want?

		I cd. hope to limit it to 20 names.



P.M.	Not askg. them to table motion.  But fear of it shd not deflect us fr.

		our policy.



B.H.	x/ We can’t get the room at St. Stephen’s.



W.	At 6.30 - 7 p.m. can do it in Central Office.



Sw.	Killearn’s Motion.



S.Ll.	No undertkg. to debate agreemt.  But if Treaty were concluded, then

		wd. be debate before ratification.



	Parliament.



P.M.	Spokesmen in debate on Vote of Censure?



O.L	H.M. and myself.





	4.	Inland Telegrams.		[Exit  BH



P.M.	V. unpopular.  But are you all satisfied.



J.S.	Think this is too sharp a rise.  Doubling it is too much for “life and

		death” messages.



PMG.	Examd. scheme :  won’t do :  adding to cost of extra words will only

		make people think out shorter messages.

	Must find more revenue.  Addl. rlway costs will put my operatg costs

		up.  Shall have to raise postal &amp; telephone charges.



JS.	Don’t dissent on merits.  But will be trouble in Parlt. (legn.).

                   x/	Cdn’t Press pay more?  To cover full cost.



PMG.	Will look into x/.



W.	H.A. Affairs Cttee. think you won’t have less trouble in H/C. at 2/6d.

	I’m not sure.

	Legn. :  is that necessary?  Cd. it go into Budget, where other balancing

		items come into a/c.



P.M.G.	Budget wd. be bad because wd. provoke criticism of Ty. using G.P.O.

		for revenue.

	Estimates Cttee. criticisms were supported by Press.



H.C.	Support plan for bringing it out in Budget : will be clouded by other

		gloom then.



R.A.B.	Will consider that, with P.M.G.		[Exit  R.A.B.





	5.	Royal Cypher.



P.M.G.	In agreemt. with J.S., propose we now dispense with EIIR. cypher

		in Scotland &amp; use only the Crown on new vans &amp; pillar boxes

		there.  A big change.



P.M.	Not v. ancient tradn. because post-boxes don’t date back before 

		Victoria.



M.F.	WD. prefer Scottish version of R. Arms.



PMG.	Crown wd. attract less notice.

			Agreed :  Crown in Scotland.



P.M.	Why in Scotland only?  Make it universal.



H.C.	Introduce Crown for genl. use, gradually.



PMG.	Men here wd. resent giving up R. Cypher in E. &amp; W. because of

		troubles in Scotland.



D.E.	Crown bldgs. &amp; sentry boxes go back far beyond post boxes.

		We have used Crown in Scotland.  But shd. be sorry not to

		use cypher in E. &amp; W.



PMG.	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



				[Enter  A.H., Solr.G.

	6.	Kenya.



A.H.	Have consulted Ld. Ch. &amp; Att. G.  Proposed to bring 3 charges –

		attempted murder, g.b. harm, &amp; harm with intent contrary to

		s.18 of Army Act.  If they proceed, he wd. be arrested.

	Possibility tht. he may be implicated in a further charge of murder of

		10 innocent men.  Public mght. think he shd. have bn. tried for

		murder on that count.



S-Genl.	These charges are in reln. to a difft. man.



Sim.	Advice only – not instns.  Discretion is with local C-in-C.



M-F.	Cab. shd. not pronounce on this.  We shd. not interfere with the

		discretion of local Commr.

				[Exit  A.H., Solr Genl.

				[Enter  J.T.

	7.	Trial of Naval Ratings.



P.M.	Shocked at verdict on these ratings.  Theft of 32/6 from a taxi-man

		scarcely warrants 2 yrs.’ &amp; 4 yrs.’ impt &amp; c.p.

	Don’t mind c.p. myself :  but people in this country are outraged by it.

		Why shd. our sailors be exposed to it.

	Apart fr. that, sentences are v. long.



J.T.	Sentenced by E. Judge :  defended by E. barrister.

	Sentences seem severe.  Tho’ less than those imposed on 2 soldiers

		in ’49 for same offence.

	Advised not to appeal i) because planned robbery, not drunken brawl.

		This wd. come out on appeal.  ii) Serv. certs. wd. also come

		out on appeal &amp; are v. bad.  iii) R. with v. is v. prevalent 

		in Singapore :  &amp; sentences mght. be increased on appeal.

	Floggings won’t be carried out for another 5 days.



O.L.	Many cases of robbery by Service men.

	Can’t interfere with course of justice.  But have asked wtr flogging

		cd. be done by R.N. not Police.



M.F.	I wdn’t interfere with sentences of this order for r. with v. in U.K.

	They beat him up in order to get his last dollar off him.

	As serious an offence as any save murder.



J.T.	We can’t flog them because flogging has bn. abolished in R.N.

					[Exit  J.T.



	8.	Uganda.



O.L.	Kabaka, advised by E. friends, may now offer to give assurances 

		asked.  Large Tory Lobby is favouring his cause.

	Shall hear him on Thurs.

	But shan’t let him go back.  For I have now seen full record, for 1st. 

		time, of his activities.  Has lived with own sister, &amp; had child 

		by her, as well as sister-in-law.  Long record of homo-sexuality

		also :  with English men :  which persists.  Treats his wife v.

		badly :  allows her only £300 p.a. while he spends thousands.

	His good behaviour has taken me in.

	Shall say “your assurances are satisf. in themselves but I must

		consider wtr I can rely on your word”.  Then, in a week’s 

		time I shall tell him I can’t rely on his word.

	Colony is quiet :  seems to have accepted his disappearance :  likely

		soon to elect a successor.



H.M.	Defend action rather on political un-reliability of promises given

		after so many refusals.





	9.	Railways (contd.)



M.F.	M/T. and M/H. can’t make prepns. w’out consultg B.T.C., B.E.A.

		&amp; Hosp. Reg. Bds. – e.g. on ques of extent to wh. Underground

		cd. operate, m’tenance of hospital services, substitn. of road

		services for rail.

	Risk of leak &amp; change of provocative action.

	But prepns. must proceed quickly.



W.M.	Wait until to-morrow, when I can give you a better prophecy.

	Wd. rather nothg. was done until I have talked to N.U.R.
