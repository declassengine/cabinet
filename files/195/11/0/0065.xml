	1.	Parliament.                   [Enter  Serv. Min., C.O.S., P.B-H., J.B-C.



H.C.	When do we take Trieste in H/C.  Tues. or Wedy.



A.E.	Situation is growing calmer – Bidault agrees.  Give it all the time we

		can to settle down.



Sal.	Unwise to take debates in both Houses on same day.  Suggd. to 

		Jowitt tht. H/L. debate shd. come later.  But if H/C. doesn’t

		debate it until Wed. H/L. debate may have to be p’poned until

		during or after Debate on Address.



P.M.	Statements shd. be simultaneous, but not debates.



			Agreed :   Wed. in H/C.  H/L. debate to be deferred.

			                “Debate on Eur. sitn. with past refce. to Trieste.”

	2.	Egypt.



A.E.	Propose to tell R. to stand pat on latest instns.

	Availability was main obstacle – refce. to U.N.  That wd. be ideal 

		point on which to break.

	Let them stew : they may well come round.





	3.	Trieste.



A.E.	Rome Tel. 653.



Al.	Winterton wants statement tht. our w’drawal wd. not be immediate.



A.E.	Timing of that wd. be v. tricky.  Nothing of mil. value will go

		until 12/11.



V.C.I.G.S.	He has now bn. told not to do anything wh. wd. reduce mil. strength

		until he receives further instns.



A.E.	Will now consult U.S. &amp; Fr., to prepare basis of a conference – in

		conjn. with It. &amp; Y.  Will take time.  But no date publicly

		assigned to our w’drawal fr. Zone A. (1/12 is date to wh. we have

		bn. workg.)



Sal.	Bidault’s 1(b) takes place of Pella’s 2(c).  Prepns. via dipl. channel

		vice Commn.



A.E.	Yes.  B.’s tel. (Paris 386) is v. good.



P.M.	Rub in fact tht. Opposn. were commd. to handing over both Zones

		to Italy.



A.E.	Tito keeps raising his price.



P.M.	Pella shd. be so told.  Publ. opinion here prefers T. to P.

					      [Exit  P.B-H.



	Egypt : Evacuation of Maltese.



A.E.	As in memo.



O.L.	Many have had no connn. with Malta for generations.  Cdn’t put them

		back into Malta.



P.M.	Tell E. we shall deduct cost fr. sterling balances.



A.E.	Bad to appear to be washing their hands of them.

A.E.	Don’t ask for any concln.  Merely wished Cab. to be aware of ques.

			                                     [Exit  O.P.   C.O.S.  A.H.  de L.  J.T.





	4.	Royal Commission on Lunacy.



P.M.	Concerned at t. of r. – esp. reference to “voluntary” treatment.

	Let someone else answer P.Q. – e.g. Home Secy.



I.M. 	70% already are not certified.  Avoids stigma.  Need is to extend

		vol. system to mental defect.



P.M.	Add “voluntarily” before treated – or “at their own

		wish”.		[Enter  A.L.B.

			Agreed.		[Exit  I. McL.





	5.	East/West Trade.



P.T.	Limited point – not raising genl. issue.  “Modificns.” vice “relaxns.”



A.E.	Don’t want any statement at present.  On 4/11 we are opening ques

		privately with U.S.  Unwise to raise public issue over it now –

		merely because of the Silvermans.

	Can’t mention these Anglo/U.S. talks, wh are private.



P.M.	Wd. be a help to us to have more trade with R., now fighting has

		ceased in K.  Gives you chance to cut it down again if sitn.

		worsens.  A valuable card.  That point shd. be put to U.S.



Sal.	Peace hasn’t bn. achieved in Indo-Ch.  French wdn’t wish to see

		any relaxn. on China trade yet.



A.E.	Alternative to last 2 sentences.  “Altho’ see controls aren’t inflexible

		it wd. not be our interest to vary them substantially until we 

		are sure etc., ….”  Keep Sal. point in mind for supplementies.



P.T.	Quite content with that.



A.E.	May I also tell U.S. &amp; French in advance.



P.T.	Have to reply this p.m.

			        F.O. amendment.  Detailed draft to be settled

		transferred to sub-contractors.  This was occasion for strike : 

		wage claim was added.  2.500 involved.  T. &amp; G.W. Union are

		calling on men to return to work.  Shall deprecate it – in H/C.

		use of troops in last resort.



A.L.B.	Ldn. Transport:  after peak hour to-morrow wd. have to cut by 25%:

	8.	Decontrol of Milk Products.
