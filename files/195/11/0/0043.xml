C.C. 35 (53)					17th June, 1953



36.	   Parliament.

					[Enter B-H., S.Ll.

H.C.	Business for next week – uncertain in some respects.



			                                             [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers, I McL.

1.	   Medical Officers in Army.

38)	

A.H.	Recommns. of Rpt. won’t solve our future problem.  Want a radical enquiry.



R.A.B.	[Agree].  Want details examined by offls. – so tht. we can see t. of r. etc., &amp; decide wtr. further Cttee. will give us anything.  Want to know views of other S. Dpts.



A.H.	They don’t want a Cttee.  I do.  For more radical steps are needed in Army. 

Sal.	Med. M. Power Cttee. in war gave me experience which leads me to approve very strongly view advanced by A.H.  Risk to civilian health if all drs. are drawn into Services during war.  Now we have N.H.S. there shd. be some pooling system &amp; comparable pay.  I wd. also welcome single med. service for 3 Services. esp. for hospitals.



P.M.	V. revolutionary proposals.  Need for drs. to be under discipline.  Separate requirements.



A.H.	Anyway, it’s clear we need an enquiry.



R.A.B.	Frightened – other services are content – may cost more etc.,



Al.	Might be financial savings in some radical solution.



P.M.             	| A.H. and Al. to agree with R.A.B. on terms of refce. of a

                    x	| new enquiry.



J.T.	If there is a radical enquiry, it shd. cover 2 other Services.



de.L.      	Shd. like to be there when t. of r. are discussed.



P.M.       	As at x/ – Al. keeping 2 other Dpts. informed.



I. Mcl.	Support view of A.H.  Lack of experienced men.  No soln. w’out a radical review.



A.H.	Need for strong chairman.  



P.M.	Consider alternatives to Waverly.

			                                                     [Exit A.H. &amp;. J.T. &amp; I.Mcl.

				   [Enter P.M.G.  J.S.





1.	    Television Development.

39)	

B-H.	In favour (incldg. Ministers) 180. : viz., in favour of commercials.

	Those against 43. – incldg. 12 who wdn’t respond to 3 line whip.

	Liberals are against it.

	Tories: 15 doubtful.  67 unknown.

	Some of anti’s mght. swing over on assurances of safeguards.

	Not a v. considerable swing – but lrs. are all anti- commercial.

		The 43 have real fear tht., if benefits of commercials can’t be demonstrated before next Election, things will go ill for us.



P.M.	Free vote?



B.H.	Worst method – because wd. use Opposn. to defeat majority of our own Party:  wd. disrupt Party unity.



P.M.	Cd. be accompanied by Decln. tht. impartiality of B.B.C. cd. be assured.

	Wd.  you sooner be beaten, with whips on, than allow free vote.



M.F.	I advocated sponsoring when we got 28 majority.  Severe confession of  weakness to change policy now.  Especially in face of C.R.A’s declaration that wd. have serious effect on standing of Govt.

	There is majority in H/C. in favour.  Believe equal amount of support among Tories in this country.  3/4 of television sets are owned by people with under £650 p.a.  We get 1/4 of that vote :  will help us if we curry favour with them on this.

	Advocate sticking to our guns on this.



P.M.	Is it wrong for a Govt. to defer to a movement of opinion?



M.F.	Believe Party cd. be swung into line.



P.M.	Wd. you be beaten or allow free vote?



Sal.  	Cdn’t get H/L. to support this policy.  Cdn’t. prevail on the opponents to refrain fr. speaking &amp; pressing.  Believe we shd. be defeated.



P.M.G.	V. doubtful – younger Peers are with us : all elder statesmen are against us.



W.	If we can be given time, we shall be better able to manoeuvre.

Gallup Poll – new one, likely to produce 2:1 in favour among television set owners.

Prodn. of safeguards &amp; conditions will satisfy many.

	Monopoly.  Go fwd. on that.



H.C.	Is there any early need for vote.

	Why not rest on B.B.C. developmt. &amp; slow down on commercials.

Allow public pinion to form m’while.



B.H.	Nothg. to prevent C.R.A. fr. tabling a motion, and precipitating a vote.



P.M.	They will precipitate it.



J.S.	Agree they will.  And diffy. in Party if we wobble.

Attlee’s speech has made it a Party issue.



P.M.	Need we make it Party issue?



R.A.B.	Wd. give grievance tht. competition on air has bn. ruled out.

	Give us time to explain tht. limited competn. in a single city is v. difft. from U.S. system.



P.T.	Risk of worst of all worlds.  Favour it in principle : but don’t get one effectively on air before next Election.  If that is impossible technically, then play for p’poning whole issue until after Election.



P.M.G.	Safeguards.  I can’t spk. about them until policy re-affirmed.



R.A.B.	Party stands in favour of principle of competition in the air.

	Statement : limit that to principle :  promise further considern. of details, conditions etc.,



P.M.	Feeling has hardened v. it.  Worst time at wh. to re-affirm principle of commercials.  CRA will table motion to take advantage of this situation.

	Nearly all best people in country are opposed to commercial television.

Rubbish to say tht. principle of competition must apply throughout.

	Much easier to shrug of a defeat if there’s bn. a free vote.  Can say it isn’t pol. issue.



Ch.	“Competition”  isn’t safe principle to stand on.  For you can have that w’out sponsoring.



W.	Why not publish the conditions?



Sw.	More – publish the whole story of how it will work.  Incldg. fact tht. B.B.C. will continue to operate.



P.M.	Telegram from O’Brian.  



M.F.	His Union is interested : theatres etc., Letter from V. Bonham Carter.

	A.E.’s views.



R.A.B.	Can we stand on television enjoying competition.  And leave it uncertain wtr. the competn. is to be provided by sponsoring or not.



Sal.	Am opposed v. strongly to sponsoring.

	R.A.B.’s plan wd. be regarded as discreditable wriggle.  WD. anger our supporters w’out pleasing others.

	WD. prefer free vote.  Immediate trouble with Party, but in long run shall get the greater credit.



B.H.	Argument v. free vote is that majority of Tories favour commercial television and do think this is a political issue : monopoly v. competition.



Sw.	Can we have, at another mtg.

i)	revised draft statement

ii)	outline of W. Paper

	Cd. R.A.B. do i) and M.F. do ii).



P.M.	Seek means of putting this off. 



H.C.	i)  	Put if off.

ii)	If we can’t : we shdn’t put whips on, even on Ministers not in Cabt.

A big change, to be made on majority of 2 or 3.



P.M.	1)  Seek means of p’poning.

	2)  Explore R.A.B.’s idea, with a few colleagues.

	3)  Only in last resort risk a division with whips.

					[Exit de.L.

					[Enter J.T.

39.	   E/W. Trade.

40)	

P.M.	Don’t read all this out.  Circulate it in Hansard.



H.C.	Endorse that.



S.Ll.	V. well.

			Approved.



					[Exit J.T., S/Ll/

40.	    Cotton

41)	

Ch.	Must go ahead.  But a pity because dollars will be in jeopardy.



O.L.	C.O. was refused copy of Rpt.



P.T.	Of course you can have it.



			Approved.





41.	    Colonial Welfare &amp; Development.

42)	

P.M.	This is only State investment.  What of private?



O.L.	Dealing with that separately.

R.A.B.	I agree.



Ch.	Why shdn’t they use their str. balances.



			Resume discn. Tuesday next week : high on Agenda.
