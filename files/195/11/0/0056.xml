C.C. 49(53).				18th August, 1953.



	1.	Biological Warfare.                 [Enter  A.H., W.Digby, de L., D.S.



Ch.	May raise troubles over germ warfare again.  Will leak.  Is it

		worthwhile?



O.L.	W’drew my objns.  But I still have apprehensions re site.



W.	Dislike all research into b.w.  But issue was wtr. these experiments

		shd. be made.  Much wd. depend on presentn. to public.  Cd. be

		represented as defensive : that satisfied me.  Approved draft

		statement.



D.S.	Cdn’t justify continuance of research if we shrink fr. the trials.

		Can do in 4 mos. in Bahamas what wd. take 5 yrs. in Hebrides.

		2 sets of trials – Press story on each occasion, but no w’spread

		Press excitement.  We have announced before tht. we are doing

		this work.  Only new aspect is the site.



Sw.	Content.  Suggd. shorter draft.



D.S.	Ready to accept valuable amendmts. suggested.



P.M.	Call them “anti-biological w’fare trials”.

				[Exit  D.S. &amp; W.D.

				[Enter  V.C.O.S.

	2.	Egypt.



	(Not heard.)





	3.	S.E. Asia.  Five Power Agency.



	Approved.





	4.	Kenya.



A.H.	C.O.S. want to meet request.  Not from M/E.  Propose therefore to

		send from U.K. Brigade H.Q. &amp; 2 Battns. – move to be complete

		by mid-Sept.  This cd. be done w’out encroachg. on reserve for

		serious trouble in M/E.



P.M.	Need the H.Q. go?



A.H.	Yes : operatg. over v. wide area.  Signals group is v. important.



O.L.	Agree : battns. may be 300 miles apart.



P.M.	Then enlarge existg. Brigade H.Q.  Preserve unity of command.

		Hand-pick additional officers.



A.H.	Erskine has 9 battns. now, will have 11., also some concern with Police.

		Needs another intermediate H.Q.



O.L.	Devolution of authy. is essential in this wide area.



A.H.	Same problem in Malaya.  Found necessary to have intermediate H.Q.



O.L.	Sitn. has not deteriorated. But has not improved as hoped.  More troops

		wd. bring it more quickly under control.  2 more battns. wd. make

		big difference – for 6-7 months.



P.M.	Prepare to send H.Q. and 2 Battns.

		M’while let C.O. put in memo. for considn. on 25/8.

					     [Exit  V.C.O.S.



	5.	Nigeria.



O.L.	At Confce. y’day they remitted this for my decision.  I said tht., if so,

		they must accept their decision.

	Wd. now propose tht. Lagos be a Federal area administered by

		Federal Govt. – not by Govr. himself.



Sw.	Support this proposal.

	Can’t let down the North.  W. and E. are split.  This is your chance.

		Do it quickly.



P.M.	They are divided.  We come in as umpire, as well as ruler.



O.L.	25 m. out of 31 m. are now in favour of my solution.



			Approved.





	6.	Re-distribution of Constituencies.



M-F.	Automatic operation.  Will be for local assocns. to take initiative in

		makg. repns. to the Commns.



W.	Impossible to forecast effects.



P.M.	If we have to legislate, what of Univ. franchise.



M-F.	Wd. not need legn. : only Order-in-Council.



P.M.	Even so, if it came before Parlt.,  ques. mght. be asked re Univ. vote.



M.F.	Will submit memo. in Sept. on Univ. franchise.

			Take Note.



	7.	Strike in France.  Transfer of T.U. Funds.



Sal.	No appln. yet.  But newsreport tht. Elect. Union have voted £1.000

		&amp; they or other Union may apply.

	Recommend no transfer while strike is in progress.

		Thereafter, revert to normal practice of allowing (only)

		contribns. designed to weaken Comm. Unions.



P.M.	Let us follow precedent set by E. Bevin:  no money to pass while

		strike is on.





	8.	Germany.   Proposed Reply to Soviet Notes.



Sal.	D.’s draft is not v. “bland”.  We had prepd. an alternative.

	M’while 2nd. S. note.  Evidently designed to influence G. elections.

		But Adenauer &amp; K. think it will have bad effect on Germans –

		another R. blunder

	But as this note has raised G. ques so directly, we shall prob. have to

		send an answer before G. elections.  Tho’ A. hasn’t made up his

		mind on this point.

	My draft annexed to memo. takes a/c. of 2nd. note.  Hope it may be

		taken as basis for discn. by drafting Cttee. in Paris.



P.M.	What is opposn. to Adenauer?  Comm. founded?



Sal.	Not Comm.  Not so closely wedded to West.  R. plan of combined

		E/W. German Govt. is equally abhorrent to both W. German

		Parties.



P.M.	Nervous of x/. G. shdn’t achieve that posn. until after Treaty.  If before,

		nothg. wd. remain for Treaty save frontiers.

	G. is still a defeated, divided and occupied country.

	Are we not giving them too much too soon?

	E.D.C. is no safeguard, for it probably won’t be ratified before 

		conference on a G. Peace Treaty begins?

	Shd. we not omit words in [  ].



Sal.	Has bn. said before, on numerous occasions.



P.M.	Wd. prefer to omit.  Pl. consider this again.



Sal.	Indications are that G. is now more likely to turn to the West.

	Bound now to take risks with G.  Can’t compel them now.  Have 

		ceased for some time to treat them otherwise than as equals.

		If we suppress this phrase now, having used it before, we shall

		appear to subscribe to R. thesis that they are subject to dictation.

		Risk tht. they mght turn left : but cdn’t prevent that by force.

P.M.	Add reference to “compatible with principles &amp; purposes of U.N.” –

		as in para. 3 of our note of 25.3.52 to Sov. Govt. (Cmd. 8501).



Sal.	Wd. sooner stop at “elections” – unless the phrase has bn. used before

		totidem verbis, which I wd. like to check.



P.M.	Much wd. turn on context.  V. difft in connn. with E.D.C.



H.M.	Our main purpose shd. be to get U.S. to revert to earlier U.S. view tht.

		we shd avoid argument &amp; proceed to mtg.



			Agreed.    Approve draft subject to further considn. of [  ]

			                          by Sal.

			                 S. to report to P.M.





	9.	Ceylon.



Sw.	Riots.  Govt. fear a further Comm. attempt.  They have asked if we 

		wd., at their formal request, land troops to aid civil power.

		We have a few Marines.  If we don’t offer, they will ask India.

		Can move a ship fr. Trinco. to Colombo.



P.M.	Is it not mixed up with Indian community?



Sw.	No.



P.M.	Bit hard on us to be asked to come in when we have bn. turned out.

		Why can’t they m’tain adequate forces to preserve law &amp; order.

	Teach them a lesson.  Wd. do them good.



Sw.	Cd. say tht. forces available are enough only to protect our own

		installns.  But doing that they wd. be showing the flag.



M-F.	Danger to-day is tht. Asiatic members of C. see no practical value in

		it.  This will demonstrate that we do stand together &amp; support

		one another.  Will strengthen solid opinion in Ceylon.



Sw.	Did this twice for N’foundland.



R.A.B.        x/	Send ship to Colombo.  Be ready to defend our own installns.  /x

		Then tell them they shd. be better able to help themselves.



			Agreed as at x/.
