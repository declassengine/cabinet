C.C. 32 (53)					19th May, 1953



18.	    Parliament.

					 [Enter B.H., H.H., S.Ll.

H.C.	Business for week after Recess.

	Friday is last day for Private Members’ Bill.





1.	    Parliament.



P.M. 	Was worried : have C.O. done their best.

	Malta is exceptional – Napoleonic war &amp; 2ndWorld war (G.C. island:  that might be special ground).  



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



	Wd. not be necessary to ask Bustamenti.

	Read letter from Mabel Strickland.



H.H. 	Jealousy from Gold Coast &amp; Jamaica – allegns. of colour prejudice.  But favour makg. an exception, despite that.

	No diffy. of the flag.



Sw. 	G.C. wd. distinguish it fr. other Colonies.  Mustn’t do anything wh. equates Malta with S. Rhodesia. That is v. important.



P.M. 	Seat in Abbey.  Don’t think he can go in a carriage.

	I will ask him to No. 10 dinner – and Bustamenti  also.



			Agreed : {anything short of equating with S. Rhodesia.

				{based on G.C. 

				       [Exit H.H.





1.	    E.D.C. : U.K. Association.



S.Ll.	Draft agreemt. does not go beyond what P.M. &amp; A.E. have said in speeches

		Annex I contains what has bn. agreed betwn. French &amp; ourselves.

Now. G. has ratified, circln. of this to 6 countries wd. help to keep up momentum.



Al.	Art. 2 commits us to consult E.D.C. before altering out strength in Europe.  Must swallow that.



			Approved.



1.	    Korea.  Armistice Talks.

22)	

P.M.	Public here think U.S. are ham-handed &amp; unreasonable over negotns. Bedell has put to me – [unanimity among neutrals:]  W’ton 1052.  S. Rhee is main obstacle : and  S. Korean troops are now v. strong.



Al.	They have 12 Divis.  U.N. only 10.



P.M.	Diffce. betw. S. Koreans and Comm. is “deep but narrow.”

New U.S. formula soon which will be as far as they think U.N. shd. go.



S.Ll.	Swiss cdn’t send troops – another reason for moving away fr. Ch. proposal.

					[Exit S.Ll.

					[Enter  de.L., de la W.

1.	    Television Development.

23)	

R.A.B.	Reported Cttee’s conclusions.

	As in paras. 1 &amp; 2 of my brief.  In line with our earlier declarations.

Means sponsored television wd. begin on 1.1.55.

	Timing of announcement.  After Coronation (to avoid disappointmt in Scotland) but before House rises:



P.M.G.	Rpt. of Tel. Adv. Cttee. will come out in recess – pledged to publish it earlier.

	Will release flood of ques. – wh. mght. be averted if we made our announcemt.  Prefer to do it about 14/6, in terms of allowg. B.B.C. to go ahead from 1/7.



J.S.	Defer all until mid-June.  Can’t be expected to do it until after Naval Review.



S.W.	Don’t produce techn. report before announcmet. of policy.  Defer T. Ad.’s Cttee. report.

	We delay sponsored stations for 18 mos.  To give B.B.C. a start?  Or because econ. resources not available for all.



P.M.G.	B.B.C. stations must be bigger because oblign. to cover whole country.  Takes longer.  They need a start therefore if they are to compete fairly with sponsored stations.

	We implied a 2 year start – in W. Paper &amp; speeches.  We are pledged to it.

18 mos. is minimum for industry to supply equipmt. enabling sets to be switched fr. one p’mme to another.

	We are committed to para II of W. Paper.  B.B.C. must complete one service over whole country before some areas get alternative stations as well.



S.W.	But the argument rests on a shortage of resources.

	Don’t give B.B.C. a preference irrespective of that shortage.



Sim.	I think we based it on lack of resources.



H.C.	We must not contradict what we said earlier – v. controversial.



P.M.G.	Gammans formula : was agreed with 1922 Cttee.

18 mos. will hurry up B.B.C. plans, which mght take 2 years.



R.A.B.	Will agree a form of words with P.M.G.

	Stand as far as we can on resources argument

	

P.M.G.	Want to discuss my statement with Cttee.



de L.	Statement of B.B.C. plans – may have effect on mil. plans.  Needs	}

more thought on that account.   Para. 5		}

					}

P.M.G.	Won’t come out until after Recess.  Can consider Serv. Dpts. points.	}



Sw.	Hope this won’t be issued.  Alternatives service – before sponsored television.



P.M.G.	They want to counter propaganda v. them.

	By no means simple.



			Agreed. { Sw. to join Cttee.  Also Services shd. be represented.

              { S of S. Air to represent them.



R.A.B.	Timing:  3rd week of June, with Tel. Adv. Cttee. report.





1.	    Post Office Staff Associations.



W.M.	Agree with memo.

	V. diff. problem.  Recognn. shd. not be a matter for Govt. but for coll. bargaining.  But difft when Govt. is employer, direct or indirect.

E.O.T.A. has no case unless Listowel is rigidly applied.  None on merits.  Ll. Roberts confirms that.

	Don’t favour treatg. Listowel formula as a principle.  Nor did Terrington Cttee.  Responsible elements in T.U.’s have made it clear tht. they wd. have to fight it to death.  Wd. provoke v. gt. diffies. with other splinters – e.g. rlway signalmen, A.E.A., A.E.U., Natl. Bus workers’ Assocn.

	And on merits it wd. be wrong to judge by numbers alone.  Bad principle, apart from expediency.  Don’t favour statement of contrary principle : wd. prefer to deal with each case separately.  Think we might win over some Tories on that basis.  Go steadily at it – no premature announcement.

P.M.G.	Agree E.O.T.A. have not got a case.  Listowel formula promised no more than considn. when more than 40% membership is gained – not automatic recognition.



P.M.	Must follow advice of M/L.  Co-opn. of big Unions is essential to us.



R.A.B.	Not easy, in view of our pledges – and practice in C. Service.



P.M.	We must carry supporters with us – we can if we try.



W.M.	Some of our members will feel pledged &amp; unable to accept my view.  But Labour Opposn. wd. support it.



M-F.	Our past isn’t so bad.  S.W. &amp; I approved answer to ques. at Election:

Tory Govt. wdn’t refer such ques. to  indep. Cttee. but wd. adhere to rules in C. Serv. tht. Union with 40% wd. be eligible for recognition.

Also 3 condns. made in my H/C. speech as quoted in memo.

	Two points.

i)	eligibility:  40%

ii)	what tests do you then apply?  On applying my tests PMG. has decided on merits v. E.O.T.A.



B.H.	Trouble in Party.  Some cannot be convinced.

	But M/L. and PMG. shd. see 1922 or Labour Cttee. before announcemt.



R.A.B.	Believe Party view was really inconsistent with what PMG. now proposes.



			Agreed:  2) Discuss with 1922 before announcement.

			               1) Uphold M/L. view	(After recess.)

			               3) Deal with Unions one by one.



R.A.B.   	No decision (final) before seeing Party.



P.M.      	Must have a view first.



R.A.B.   	Then talk solely on basis of E.O.T.A.  Avoid AEA pro tem for it needs much more thought.
