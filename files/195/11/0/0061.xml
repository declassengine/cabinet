C.C. 56 (53)					7th October, 1953



87.	    British Guiana.



O.L.	New factor. Peace in G.town.  Troops landed with response of cheers.

Contrary to Govr’s forecasts.

	Govr. has now concluded it wd. be unwise to arrest any Ministers unless situation gets worse.  Mistake to anticipate action on their part.

	Have told Govr.

i)	assume emergency powers.

ii)	remove portfolios of Ministers.

iii)	issue Govt. statement &amp; b’cast intentn. to suspend constitution.

iv)	await developmts. before make arrests if necessary, consultg. me in advance if time permits.



P.M.	No violence yet.  These men know how to play constitutionally.

		Don’t therefore put ourselves in wrong by acting prematurely.

	Can defend resuming executive control.  Can’t yet defend arrests of individuals.



A.E.	Will Ministers rouse protests etc.,?



O.L.	Public mtgs. can be forbidden.



A.E.	They will seek to promote strikes?



O.L.	Probably.



Sal.	World will be watchg. us.  Suppose ex-Ministers flout law, promote strikes etc., they shd. be arrested.  We shd. look weak to leave them at large.



O.L.	They will prob. do nothing.  And then we may have to keep troops even longer in B.G.



Al.	Argylls Battn. due to sail for B.G. on Saty mght sail to Jamaica instead.  And p’pone sailing of Gloucesters, due on 14/10.



P.M.	P’pone decision.  Can divert them at sea.

	Let Gloucesters remain – review their posn. in 2 or 3 days.

					[Exit H.M.



1.	    Trieste.



A.E.	Messages delivered.  Tito took it quite well:  we didn’t ask for guarantee of good behaviour.  Didn’t threaten annexn. of Zone B.
