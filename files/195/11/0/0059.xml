C.C. 54 (53)					2nd October, 1953



70.	    Hong-Kong.		   [Enter A.L-B., A.N., P.B-H, C.O.S.	



P.M.	Protest rejected. Can’t leave it like that.



Sal.	Was on v. edge of terr. waters : but, even so, not warranted.

Our guns were not manned.

	Stiff reply &amp; demand for compensn. wd. be normal line.  But we shan’t get that.

	Will consider as soon as ct. of enquiry rpt is available.



A.N.	Report is on its way – by air.



P.M.	We must seek ways of bringing it home to Chinese.

					[Exit A.N.



1.	    Egypt.



Sal.	Our “final terms” are not going v. well with E – who are querying even things they accepted before e.g. re-activation.

	No sense in attempting further compromise.  Propose we say firmly that these are our final terms.

	Uniforms – stand quite firm save for poss. concessions on arm-bands.



C.I.G.S.	Must be in uniform on duty.  Cd. be ordered to wear plain-clothes off duty e.g. in E. towns, off duty.



P.M.	Shd. wear uniform as much as poss. – tho’ not of course in Cairo.

	Wd. sooner not conclude anything before Parlt. meets – wd. be better tht. we be holding out then, &amp; have chance to explain posn. quietly to Tory supporters before agreemt. is concluded.



					[Exit A.L-B.

1.	    Trieste.



Sal.	Last year U.S. wdn’t support us in imposing solution on basis of existing zones.  But they now advocate v. much the same course of action.  Their original plan of procedure was v. complex: we think it better to approach both sides simultaneously.

	Latest claims.  Both sides know tht. its claim won’t succeed.

	As in memo.  First approaches wd. be private : &amp; if assurances sought were refused at outset plan cd. be dropped.  If assurances given, public announcement wd. be made.

	Transfer of control to Italians wd. be ticklish – our troops must be out before Italians take over.

	Must reserve right to say publicly tht. in our view this shd. be a permanent settlement.  Tho’ U.S. won’t say this, think we must in order to satisfy Tito.

	Risk – even of armed clashes.  But even more dangerous to allow existg. situation to continue.



C.I.G.S.	Talks with Tito last week : I confined myself to advocatg. It/Yug. agreemt. to permit joint planning.  His only reply was : must be final.  Believe grave risk of fighting unless Tito gives an assurance as proposed.

	Hand-over to Italians must be done by methodical plan – and no It. troops shd. come in until we are ready to go out.

	In Zone 6.000 Police containing Slovenes.  Their reliability is not clear – except to B. Officers.  V. tricky point.



P.M.	Tito is unlikely to stand out v. firm Anglo-U.S. stand.

	Let Sal. pursue details with U.S.



Sal.	Must tell French at once what we intend.  Then make first approach to Rome &amp; Belgrade on 6th. (?) Oct.



A.E.	French will tell Italians at once.  We shd. delay informing Fr. until Mon : then speak in Rome on Tuesday.

(i)	Permanent solution.  Italy will have grievance v. us if we say this &amp; U.S. don’t.  Shd. make further effort to get U.S. to join us in saying this.



Sal.	Have tried v. hard to persuade U.S.

	I intend tht. we shd. not include anything re permanence in our official announcement.	        {Sal. –Dulles

	Let A.E. make a personal appeal to Dulles	Agreed  {P.M. to send 

		              {message to 

		              {President.



A.E.	(ii)  Methodical transfer.  Shd. be as quick as possible.



C.I.G.S.	Agree.  But to make hand-over short, we need time for preliminaries e.g. removal of 1,100 families and stores. [Depends on shipping. – troops : families can go by train.



A.E.	Shipping (for troops) must be available.

(iii)	If we embark on this, we must be firm with Tito. He said last year he wd. take it.



P.M.	M/D. to co-ordinate Dpl. preparations.  	Agreed.

















1.	    British Guiana.

74)	

O.L.	Situation is now even worse.  Govr. thinks only 50% of Police are reliable.  Intend to move on 9/10.  Cruiser will lie off &amp; 2 frigates will take in the troops.

	45% of population are Indians (descendants of Slave labour). 

Doubt if they will make much trouble.

	Have taken decision w’out recommn. from Govr.



P.M.	In U.S. anti-Commn. will offset anti-Colonial feeling.

	But shd. we not tell them in advance?



O.L.	Tell Canada 24 hrs. in advance.  Don’t tell India.  Tell U.S. only that sitn. is worsening – not action we intend to take.



Sal.	R.M. recommends they be informed, but only 24 hrs or so in advance of action.



P.M.	Safety in overwhelming force.  Have enough troops : and use tear-gas.



Al.	If necessary, we cd. send another battn. from U.K.  But, even by air, it wd. take 14 days.



O.L.	And I want prompter action, before morale of Police crumbles.



C.N.S.	Cd. get a 2nd. battn., by carrier, to arrive 10 days after 1st. battn.



O.L.	Volunteer force 450 strong – prob. quite reliable.

		Act quickly (9/10) &amp; alert 2nd. battalion.



P.M.	Wd. sooner send double strength on 20/10 – to avoid bloodshed.



C.I.G.S.	Local Commr. has seen Govr. and thinks one battn. can handle it.



Sal.	Tell Venezuela Govt. also – the night before.

			Inform : Canada in full 48 hrs ahead.

			              U.S. 24 hrs. ahead – also Austr. &amp; N.Z.

			              Other Doms. at zero hour.



L.P.S.	Act earlier.  2nd. battn. is weak. (only 400) &amp; wdn’t off-set risk of delay.



CIGS.	Can’t send stronger battn. w’out drawg. on brigade held ready for trouble in Egypt.



			Agreed : Act on C.O. plan.

			               Alert carrier &amp; full-strength battn. to re-inforce if 	need arises.



					[Exit C.O.S.





1.	    British Somaliland.

75)	

Sal.	Concerned at transfer of tribes in corridor, w’out consultn.

	Wd. welcome further consultn. on that point.



P.M.	Sal. (Chairman) M/Def., C.O. and H.M. with F. Secy. Ty. to consider

	details &amp; report (not less than 2 weeks).





1.	    Housing Policy.

					[Enter D.E., I. McL.



L.P.S.	Cttee. has cleared most of points raised in Cab. last discn.



H.M.	i) Do we embark on this?

	ii) How &amp; when do we announce?

	iii) What is best method?

	If we go on, we can’t make it acceptable w’out time to produce its 

	results. Will therefore have effect on Parlt. – e.g. by-elections etc.,

	Favour publicn. on afternoon of Queen’s Speech.  Genl. debate in Debate on Address : 2nd. Rdg. in December.

	Can therefore be a little more vague on some detailed diffies.

	Want to alter title of W. Paper : don’t want to claim that it is a comprehensive policy. “Houses : The  Next Step.” is to be preferred.  Then don’t refer in Paper to anythg. we can’t put in the Bill.

	Agree some refce. must be made to housing subsidy.  Think para. 91 is stronger than RAB’s formula.  Can settle the wording with RAB.

	Big remaining ques.  It is a repairs increase.  Logical to make it twice S.D.  Rejected % increase.  Inherent therefore to have higher % increase on smaller rents.  Conclude therefore tht. we shd. propose twice S.D.  Then we must have the 2nd. l’lord condition – tht. repairs have bn. done.  Must be able to deny criticism tht. we are putting money into pockets of l’lords.

	Criticism will be, not so much in Parlt. as in constituencies. 



P.M.	Shd. foreshadow this at Margate.



J.S.	Will make it more diff. (paras 3-8 of C.251) for me to m’tain my separate line for Scotland.  I may get knocked off it in Parly. debates.



H.M.	There are many diffces. betw. E. &amp; Sc. systems which justify difft. treatment.  E. Bill will come first : we can see how we go.



R.A.B.	Major political move.  Press is pretty favourable.  Dutch have raised rents:  &amp; are raising wages by 5% on that account.  That shows our diffies.  Govt. is losing popularity :  this will make it worse.  But even so I favour this : it may enable us to emerge with greater credit.

	Support twice S.D.

	Will discuss details with H.M. on i) wording of subsidy reference 

		ii) reference to emergency scheme.



A.E.	Sooner it’s done, the better.  Given time, we may get greater credit out of it.  But it means we cdn’t win an early Election.



P.M.	Our posn. is founded on national respect.  This shd. enhance it.



W.M.	Support this.  Tho’ it will have an awkward effect in future years on wage claims, in so far as it increases c/living figure.

	Eng. &amp; ship-bldg. trades are in for diff. time on wages.  Must avert any avoidable increases in c/living.



F.H.	Shall get credit for courage in doing what is known to be right.



			Memo. approved.





1.	    Remuneration of Judges.

77)	

P.M.	Don’t make this retrospective.          }  Agreed.

	Mention it in Queen’s Speech           }

	Consider timing of Bill in relation to Rpt. on M.P.’s salaries.

Shall have to seek also agreemt. on Ministers’ salaries – and perhaps allowances for H/L.



R.A.B.	Agree on timing.

	On Bill – I wd. rather not have Schedule.  Will discuss with Ld. Chanc. &amp; S of S. Scotland.

	Wish also to consider posn. of Ld. Ch. &amp; L.C.J.



Sim.	V. ready to accept lower figures for these.



Sal.	No salaries for Peers.  But do want some concession on expenses.  W’out too much delay.



P.M.	Try to relate it to attendances.  



Sal.	V. ready to do that.
