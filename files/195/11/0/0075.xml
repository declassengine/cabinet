C.C. 70 (53)				                                                         24th November, 1953



						[Enter B.-H

131.	    Service Officers’ Retired Pay.



P.M.	Read draft of statement to be made in H/C. that p.m.



			Agreed – subject to amendments.





1.	    Purchase of Gold for Sterling.



A.E.	Reported success of opn.





1.	    Trieste.



A.E.	Italians have made substantial concessions. But qua Y. have spoilt it by saying they have done what we wanted.  Shall now have to work hard on Y.  Fair chance we shall get the conference.





1.	    N.A.T.O. Association of M.P’s.



A.E.	Don’t want to follow Strasbourg.

	But M.P.’s shd. know of N.A.T.O. &amp; support it.

	Modest proposals – wd. help.



H.C.	Must be in Parly. recesses.



A.E.	Wd. be bi-partisan : with pairs.



			Agreed.		[Enter D. &amp; G.





1.	    Television Policy.



Sal.	RAB.’s statement at a dinner – haven’t made up our minds.

He stands on principle of paymt. for advts. but w’in that is ready to consider what is said in debate.

	Suppose spkers, in H/L. suggests 2 corpns. in competn. but neither advertising.  Our answer :  all wd. pay double fee &amp; only ½ wd. get an advantage.  But a reasonable compromise wd. be 2 corpns. one of wh. wd. draw income fr. advts.  Shd. I say tht. we wd. consider that?  It wd. eliminate commercial cos.

	We shall incur opposn. of large no. of sound people in country.

		Mght. be wise to offer some compromise.



P.M.G.	I have always preferred 2nd. corpn. financed by advts.  But Cttee. rejected it i) because £5-6M of speculative capital wd. be needed

			ii) too Socialist in character to appeal to Tories.

	Disposed now, however, to stand to our scheme as in Wh. Paper.



M-F.	Present plan is limit beyond wh. RAB won’t risk public funds.



PMG	Stand pat on principles :  but ready to adjust detail in light of debate.



H.M.	So long as financed by advts, other method of 2nd. corpn. cd. be promised considn.



M-F.	But R.A.B. has considered it and rejected it, emphatically.



H.M.	But we listen to debate.  We need not oppose that suggn. inflexibly.



M-F.	You can’t say this is new.



Sal.	You can say they are putting it fwd. for the first time.  I can promise to consider it further.



A.E.	Don’t show any enthusiasm for it.

					[Exit P.M.G. and G.

					B.H.

1.	    British Honduras.



O.L.	Some unwelcome similarities with B. Guiana.  But significant diffces.

         	x| esp. the official majority on Executive Council.  Govr. will have

	    emergency powers.  R.C. Church, tho’ anti-British, is more anti-

	    Comm.  More serious to w’draw now than to go forward.



P.M.  x|	is significant difference.  



O.L.	But also electoral chances of P.U.P. and influence of R.C.’s



A.E.	And U.S. is putting pressure on Guatemala.



P.M.	Foolish to go straight to universal adult suffrage.



O.L.	Recommended by indep. Cttee. in 1947.  Cdn’t deviate fr. their finding on this point.



Sal.	Don’t like argument tht. we can’t delay any of these changes w’out being charged with changing our liberal policy.  That will lose Empire altogether.





1.	    Industrial Disputes:  Engineering.



W.M.	Looks as tho’ 24 hr. strike will take place next week.

	Workers have informed me of dispute.  Am not askg. either side to confer with me now.  Employers wdn’t make an offer under threat of strike.  Men decided not to ask for Enquiry:

no reason therefore to believe they wd. accept its findings.  I shall say tht. intervention by me, for wh. neither side has asked, wd. not serve a useful purpose at present.

	They won’t want a long strike nr. Xmas.

	Tho’ craftsmen can make up earnings, labourers can’t &amp; won’t like it.
