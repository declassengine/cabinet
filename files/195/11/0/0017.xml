C.C. 9(53)							11th February, 1953



		1.	Sudan.						[Enter B.H.



A.E.	Agreement virtually reached on points outstanding.

	Our posn. was largely compromised when E. &amp; S. pol. Parties reached their agreemt.  Since then all we cd. do was to improve on that agreement.  We have improved it.



	Do we sign to-morrow or not?



	P’ponement.  Followg. day is Friday : shd. have to defer to Saturday : awkward to leave Parly. statement until next week.  P’ponement until next week involves risk that E. will run out.  Pressures in Cairo : because this is first time E. has abandoned claim to sovereignty over whole of Nile Valley.

	HC is under criticism for that.

	Dangerous to lose it : because S. want the agreement.

	Dates.	E. claim to sovereignty dates fr. 1819.  Never abandoned before.

		1951 Oct. Wafd. denounced Con-dominium.  We decided in 	Oct. ’52 to go on with elections none the less.  Nov. ’52 E. 	renounced claim to sovereignty, in agreement with S.  S. want 	it signed on that a/c by both Co-Domini.



	If we decide to go on, I cd. explain to 1922 Cttee. before I announce it in afternoon.

	We can’t improve on this.  If we don’t sign S. will stand by their agreemt. with E. wh. is less satisfactory.  How cd. we stop them going thro’ with it.



P.M.	Don’t trust N.  He hasn’t power to settle himself.  He is thinking of getting us out of Canal.  Then he will bribe his way back into Sudan.



A.E.	S. is richer than E.  They have large surplus.  Don’t love Egyptians.



P.M.	Why hurry?  Need time to explain to our followers.  Newspapers will be hostile.  General retreat of Britain.  Even Howe says “blow to our prestige”.



B.H.	F. Affairs Cttee. Y’day : 50 members : all but 2 were critical of agreement.



	Played our hand badly : muscled out by E. : N. not to be trusted : repercussions in M/E.  Specific points : Commn. contains 4 Muslims to one Br. : no chance for S. to opt for admn. to Br. Comm.

	V. widespread disquiet.  12 have said cdn’t vote for it.

	At present we haven’t support of Party.



A.E.	Answers to many points.  Don’t want S. in Comm.  But of course any independent country can ask for membership.



O.L.	S. was promised self-govt. and self-determination.  That is source of trouble.  We wd. have had to repudiate that or try to carry it out.



A.E.	Not only a Labour Govt. promise.  Even in 1936 Treaty we confirmed joint nature of tenure in Sudan &amp; avowed our object as for the welfare of Sudan.

	This is much easier to defend to our public than the agreement which E. made with the S. Parties.

	If we don’t take this, we shall have both S. &amp; E. v. us.

	Defence.  If Sudan is settled, they can ask for def. talks to begin.

	But in those talks our position won’t be prejudiced by what we have settled over Sudan.



P.M.	Had hoped S. wd. associate with us by Treaty.



A.E.	No reason in this why they shouldn’t.



Al.	We cd. say that we have wished for years to work for S. independence.

	But don’t want you to be overrun : offer mil. guarantee of continuing independence.  Such a treaty wd. help us to prevent E. from worming themselves back.



M.F.	P. 3 of notes : para. 2.  Can Parlt. determine period as soon as it assembles?  



A.E. 	May be so de iure  But unlikely they wd. do it before end of 3 years.



A.E.	Want elections in spring.  Must start arrangements by end/Feb.

	We agreed earlier tht. quick elections were in our interests.



P.M.	Will be regarded as a Br. collapse.  May put us in gt.  political diffies.  Wd. wish A.E. to see 1922 Cttee. To-morrow &amp; see what feeling is.  Opposition wd. exploit our diffies.  M’while delay decision until Monday.



A.E.	I was told tht. Press (other than B’brook) wd. be critical if this chance of agreement were missed.



P.M.	Recognise tht. we are committed to some extent.  But concerned about world re-action.



A.E.	This is much better than anything I had hoped to get since E. made their agreement with S. Parties.  Text improved – even in last week greater advances have bn. made.  U.S. have helped in this.



	If we delay, there will be criticism wh. I can’t answer because text is not available.  And what I say to 1922 will leak to B’brook Press.



		



		2.	Egypt.



P.M.	Hear M/D. on what we cd. do if, after a break-down over Sudan, E. tried to edge us out of Canal.



Al.	Explained dispositions of Br. and E. troops in Egypt, and plans for dealing with trouble if it arose.



		1.	Sudan (resumed.

J.S. &amp; H.C.	Let A.E. see some Tories to-night and quieten them.



Sim.	We have promised self.govt. and self determn.  Have we any chance of giving it to them on better terms?



A.E.	I think we may well get worse terms.



P.M.	Wait – E. may do somethg. foolish.



A.E.	Risk of finding ourselves in worse posn.  If they return to Neguib agreemt., we shall be v. E. &amp; S. &amp; how do we handle that situatn.



		Agreed :	F. Affairs Cttee. to meet with A.E. at 9.30 pm.

				Cabinet to meet thereafter : 10.40 pm.





		3.	Corporal Punishment.



M.F.	Free vote.

	My advice : oppose this Bill on b) and c) in memo.



P.M.	Dont “oppose”.  Say don’t think this a good Bill because defects.

	Also say this isn’t a good time.



M.F.	Ministers shd. not vote v. this advice : they can abstain.
