C.C. 47(53).				30th July, 1953.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  B-H.



H.C.	For week after recess.

	Prorogue in followg. wk. (before 30/10).  New Session 3/11 :

		leave obtd. to announce this to-day.

	Leaves one day in hand before 30/10 for genl. debates : can 

		promise it for debate on Wales.

	Shall have completed all Bills mentioned in Q. Speech:  indeed, all

		but one will finish by 31/7.  *Little legve. business to finish in

		spill-over.*



	Remainder of this week.



H.C.	C.R.A. will ask for 2 hrs. on Appropn. Bill – on Dulles’ speech} To-

		2 hrs. on cotton.  Ending with 2 hrs. on food hygiene.     }  day.

	Can’t have a Divn.



R.A.B.	C.R.A. is v. angry with Dulles.  Insists tht. Cab. Minister shd. speak.

		Sal. &amp; S. Ll. are concocting a line on China – but we can’t

		give an answer on seating Ch. in U.N.  M/State will reply to

		debate:  Spker can then end it &amp; call next business.





	2.	Cabinets in August.



R.A.B.	Arrangements confirmed.   P.M. agrees.





	3.	Malta and Gold Coast.	[Enter  Salis.



	a)	Malta.

O.L.	Whole popn. are in a state at being described as Colony &amp; brigaded

		with Africans.  “G.C. Island” doesn’t help.  People v. loyal :

		Cab. v. troublesome.  Can’t have Dom. permanently on the dole.

		Malta can’t be viable in foresee-able future.

	Some gesture is needed, however.

	Transfer to C.R.O. would give dangerous impn. of Dom. status.

	Transfer to H.O. wd. be a gesture w’out implications of that kind.

	Suggested tht. Privy Council part of this plan might be stressed more –

		Home Secy. more as agent of Council.  For another island in 

		future, e.g. Mauritius, Col. Secy. might be agent of Council.

		In presentn. cd. stress Privy Council aspect.



M.F.	Agree P.C. shd. be made keystone.  It is already so in relation to 

		Ch. Islands.

		Workable approach.  Needn’t stop at Malta:  nor need it be 

		assumed tht. Home Secy wd. always be agent of Council.

	Ready to take it on.

Sim.            x/	Under Privy Council with a S/S. as agent.  Then any S of S. can act.



Sal.	For Malta this is acceptable solution; if Maltese will accept it.



R.A.B.	Financial aid : Budget : Col. Welfare : Dockyard : C. Aviation etc.,

		wd. look to know more of H.O. capacity to handle these matters.

                   y/		Much larger adminve. burden than Ch. Isl. or I of Man.

	Suggest more examinn. of x/ and y/ and reference to P.M.



H.C.	May be new conception of future status of small Colonies. – from the

		constitutional angle.



J.F.	Don’t equate it to N. Ireland.



	b)	Gold Coast.



O.L.	Their demands follow what I foresaw.   But they add i) Act of

		Independence  ii) Transfer to C.R.O.  I believe ii) cd. be 

		suppressed for interim period if i) were conceded.



Sal.	Danger of diluting the Commonwealth with new black independent

		countries.



			Agreed : refuse transfer to C.R.O.			[Exit  M-F.





	4.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	At this stage it isn’t diff. to see a solution or at least a policy viz.,

		p’pone J.’s entry for as long as possible.  I wd. mobilise as

		much support as possible for a policy of delay.



RAB.	Agree to drop Art. 23 plan (Ty) if you agree not for forecast Art. 35

		solution.  Play for time w’out disclosing our eventual line.



Ch.	Can’t U.S. help us to delay it?



			Agreed.





	5.	Judges’ Salaries.



R.A.B.	Seek authy. to draft a new Bill on these lines – wh. Sim. &amp; J.S. accept.

		The net increase is not far short of original promise.



Sim.	This is acceptable substitute.  Judges wd. welcome it.



R.A.B.	Timing of introdn. can be considered later.  Present it again as a Bill.



B.H.	1922 Cttee. seemed to favour solution by salary increase.

		But further soundings will be needed before we can be sure.



R.A.B.	Retrospn. – to be included, in square brackets, for	[Enter  Solr.Genl.

		final decision by Cabinet.  Viz., Back to date of introdn. of

		original Bill.		[Exit  Solr.Genl.

					[Enter  de L.

					[Exit  B.H.

	6.	Officers’ Retired Pay.



Al.	Plan is generous.  But will Ty. bear it?  If it’s found that it is too

		expensive or repercussive, let us go back to my restorn. of 9½%

		cut.  It won’t be diff. to hold it to officers.



R.A.B.	Can’t do M/D. plan and not extend it to Civil Servants.



Ch.	Easier to limit it on basis of original plan.



R.A.B.	No : for you can’t isolate it as breach of contract – tho’ said to be one,

		it wasn’t.



O.L.	Retired officers are different because they retire so much earlier &amp; 

		w’out gratuity.  They are not on all fours.



R.A.B.	Agitn. for C. Servants has started already.



Al.	Re-affirmed his suspicions.



J.F.	Indian Services – armed &amp; civilian.		[Exit  de L.





	7.	E./West Trade:  Transaction Controls.



P.T.	If we do this -  i)    wd. check t’shipment to Sov. bloc, to some

			                     extent.

			       ii)   wdn’t stop there.  Shd. be pressed to extend to

			                     Colonies etc.,

			       iii)  not much more than pin prick.  Is it wise to do it

			                      now, in view of 4 Power etc.,



Sal.	F.O. think we shd. not p’pone for too long.

	I wd. prefer to keep it fluid for a time.



R.A.B.	Cd. we agree in principle but suggest introdn. be p’poned.



P.T.	That wd. commit us.

	Dulles’ line is status quo.  We have agreed not to press him for

		relaxation.  Will we not agree tht. he will not press us to 

		intensify.



O.L.	Legn. will be needed for Colonies.



R.A.B.	Play for time.

Sal.	Cd. we promise to do it if others will do ditto.



P.T.	Is this moment to strike that bargain?  Prefer to p’pone, w’out

		showing reluctance.



R.A.B.	Show that it’s our policy to stop l’holes. tho’ we are considerg means

		of applicn.

	Remember, however, genl. review.  Avoid agreeing to final plan.
