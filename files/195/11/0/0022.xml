C.C. 14(53)							24th February 1953



		1.	Persia.					[Enter G.H. and Att.Gen.



A.E.	Not optimistic tht. M. will accept new proposals – tho’ they are satisfy. to us.



	Ques. is wthr. new U.S. Adm. will stand by them or press for modificn.  I believe they may be more firm than their predecessors.



L.	I agree.						[Exit G.H.





		2.	Germany : Arrest of ex Nazis.



A.E.	Good deal of material : examn. not finished.  Hope tht. w’in 1 week we may be able to hand it all over to Adenauer – in state in wh. he may be able to take procdgs.

	Clear links with Moseley &amp; French Fascists.

	Pol. and financial links between Banmann (not arrested) and Russia.

	M’while protests v. our refusal to allow prs. to see their counsel.

	Hope that, when this appeal is determined, we may be able to transfer to Adenauer.  At present, no charges : merely investigation.

	We must see this thro’.  The defence counsel are suspect.



Sim.	Last point cd. be brght out.



P.M.	We can say tht. full facilities can be given when we reach stage of procdgs.



Sim.	We have reached that because habeas corpus procdgs. have bn. instituted.

	Tho’ they are not under a charge.



W.M.	Mistake was to allow the procdgs. to start.  We shd. have stopped them.

	Once procdgs. have begun, we can’t put too high the objections to his seeing counsel.



P.M.	Avoid a row over this.  Say : i) as soon as any charge is preferred they will have full access to counsel.  ii) No intentn. to hold them indefinitely, w’out trial.



Att.G.	Issue is referred to higher court.  We are not intervening qua Govt.





		3.	Magistrates’ Courts : Part-time Clerks.



M.F.	April next the clerks become subject to requiremt. to retire – unless service is extended by Mag. Cttees.  Efficiency of new scheme turns on wthr. the part-timers go.  12 counties have made scheme, &amp; ques of their introdn. turns on compensn. ques.



	Other points:	b) breach of faith.

			c) this is difft.  from the other categories.



R.A.B.	Act was said to be going to cost £¼M. – coming out at £1 M.

	Don’t admit we are pledged.

	Repercussions : N.I. part-timers wd. have to be conceded.



M.F.	Have stressed need for economy.  Will prob. not be more than £800.000.



Sim.	Tho’ no pledge, the Bill clearly passed H/L. on footing tht. this compensn. wd. be paid.  Salisb. finds gt. diffy. in going back on that understanding.  Whole time Clerks wd. be an improvemt. in efficiency.

	Believed other Ministers were now convinced tht. repercussions cd. be resisted.



R.A.B.	Opposn. will press for them.

	Can I re-consider with Dpts. means of ensuring a slow transition.



Att.G.	Reform can’t work w’out this compensn.

	Pol. diff. to say now tht. we aren’t going to put our back into this Act.



W.M.	Only reason for delay : repercussions.  And you ought to be able to m’tain tht. these people are different from the others.



R.A.B.	Don’t see the need for making these courts efficient.

	Can’t we at least do it slowly?



M.F.	We don’t control the pace : it’s the Magistrates Cttees. 



	No conclusion.



							                 [Exit Att.G.

		4.	European Defence Community.



A.E.		(i)  Extend N.A.T.O. commitmt. to 50 years.  Propose to amend, so as to 		indicate merely willingness to propose it to all members of N.A.T.O. – 		to avoid suggn. tht. we are bringing pressure to bear on U.S.



P.M.	No objn. tho’ I don’t believe U.S. will agree.



A.E.		(ii)  Propose addn. to para.7.



Al.	Put in alternative version of para.7.



A.E.	This is a plan for additional discn. with the Six Powers.



		Discussions to be resumed – on Thursday.



		5.	Treaty with Libya.



A.E.	Reports stage reached.  Ready to initial.



R.A.B.	Support this.  



Al. 	So do I.



		Approved.



	

		6.	Hungary : M : Sanders.



O.L.	Appln. for leave to appeal was dismissed.  I represented case to Malaya.

	Att. G. strongly favouring commutation.  Not certain tht. Ruler will commute.  When sentence is commuted, may we proceed with the exchange.



P.M.	Odd that. Hungary shd. show such interest in Malaya.

	The swop wd. be disreputable &amp; in no relation to any conceptn. of justice.

	No connn. betwn. the 2 cases save R. behind the scenes.

	Where will this lead?  May provoke R. to lock up some more hostages.

	New process in relns. betwn. civilised States.



A.E.	Hankey’s tel. puts the case strongly.  If we don’t do this, we shall never get Sanders out.



P.M.	V. dangerous process to embark on.  R. will always get more hostages than we shall.



A.E.	No need for us to make it public that we had made the swap.  The two decisions cd. be announced separately.	



P.M.	You won’t be able to keep it quiet.



A.E.	Let me consider, before Thursday, wthr. there is anything else we cd. do., on behalf of Sanders.



		Decision p’poned until Thursday.

		Sentence shd. be commuted before Cab. decn. is taken.





		7.	Coronation : The Homage.



Sim.	Sub. Cttee. has reported tht. time-factor won’t allow of Speaker taking part.

	C.R.A. was a member of the Sub. Cttee.

	Has been based wholly on time-factor.



R.A.B.	Still think it wd. have bn. a good idea.



Sim.	There the matter will rest unless Cor. Cttee. wish to discuss it because of dissent from Sub. Cttee.’s recommendns.
