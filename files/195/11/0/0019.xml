		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Labour Party wanted ½ day on export of jets.  This was refused : but if they ask for debate on Sudan we cd. offer Wednesday.



A.E.	Agree.  Keep jets on adjournment.



H.C.	Opposn. insist tht. R. Titles Bill shd. start in H/C.  Can’t take 2nd Rdg. much before Easter.

		2.	Falkland Islands.		[Enter J.T. &amp; G.Grantham



Sim.	Clear title to Deceptn. Island.  Right therefore to resist aggression or enforce d.o.



	Wiser to act on second basis – illegal entry vice act of war.

	Superb cdn’t go beyond Falkland Islands – otherwise wd. be breach of Tripartite Declaration.  Marines from Superb would go on in Snipe.

	Final destination : Montevideo recommended, unless party will go back on their own ship.



O.L.	I wd. wish to leave marines on Deceptn. while Snipe is takg. party away.



J.T.	If Argentines then arrive in force, they will take marines prisoner.

	Moreover, they aren’t equipped, and can’t be in time, for Antarctic weather.



O.L.	Surely R.N. cd. see off any force likely to arrive there.



A.E.	V. unlikely that they wd. try.

	Put them on Argentine whaler at S. Georgia.



J.T.	It’s 1.000 miles off : tanker wd. have to be delayed.



Al.	Unlikely that Argentines will attack our civilians.



P.M.	Call for volunteers – incldg. 2 offrs. and 2 n.c.o.’s.

	Put them ashore – &amp; see they don’t get left there all winter.



V.C.N.S.	Second frigate will arrive in area in 2 weeks’ time.



P.M.	Take them off : put them on tanker : 2nd frigate can tell us in 2 wks. what has happened : [and take marines off : if we agree.]  M’while diplomatic exchanges will have occurred.



	Don’t at this stage leave marines behind.



P.M.	(Snipe takes them off.

		Memo. approved.



	

		4.	Coal Prices.				[Enter D.S. &amp; G.H.



L.	M/L. doesn’t think it possible to p’pone for long.



W.M.	Agree tht. it’s diff. to p’pone any part of increase until we see wthr. prodn. will increase.  Wages dispute will be settled soon.  The 6/= will be awarded to 400.000.  N.C.B. will then see Press &amp; stress need for increased prodn. in view of wage increase.  That will be the important announcemt.



	The price increase can be announced later.

	Employers’ view on c/living.  Since Tuesd. Ec. Cttee. of T.U.C. have taken same view &amp; intend to press it on R.A.B.

	There will be more unemployed, however.  May be incentive to harder work.  Tho’ it won’t go above ½ m.  But that won’t improve industl. relations.  It will be a diff. year.  Next 6 months we may be able to hold posn. of unemplt.



L.	Increase in price fr. 2/3 – announce 10 days previously.



P.M.	Regret this decision – as I think we all shall.  No doubt it is orthodox finance.  We can blame it on natn.  Ty. will pay dearly for their orthodoxy.



P.T.	Hope ques. will be examined wthr. whole of increased coal price need be reflected in steel prices.

D.S.	Want this allowed.  A year ago we prevented steel industry fr. passing on increased costs : made them carry £19 m. of increased costs.  The big profits of past years were derived fr. high export prices &amp; those are now dropping.  Developmt. plans (£60M. p.a.) based on assumptn. tht. 50% will come out of earnings.  Profit level in steel proper is only 6½% of turnover.

	Want steel increase to be publd. v. soon after coal increases.



W.M.	Avoid suggn. tht these prices are automatic consequence of wage increases.

	That undermines collective bargaining.



          x/	May drafting of last sentence be re-considered -    Agreed.

		

		(Coal Price Increase – Approved, subject to x/.

		(Steel Price Increase – E.P.C. to consider.



							[Exit D.S. G.Ll.

		5.	Ministry of Pensions.			[Enter O.P., McL., H.Am



R.A.B.	Amalgamate announcemt. with M/T. – M/C.A. at same time.  Will take some time (M/P.).  Also with amalgamation in Regions : closing some Regions down and having all trade/industry Dpts,. housed in one Regional bldg.



	Announce in perhaps 4/6 weeks.



		Approved.				[Exit O.P., O.L., H.Am.





		6.	National Health Service.



P.T.	Dislike t. of r.  Want to avoid risk of report recommending more.



P.M.	Let P.T. settle with R.A.B. and McL. wording of t. of ref.



		Agreed.

							[Exit McL.

							[Enter H.G.

		7.	Arms for Wales.



M.F.	Augmentn. of Badge wh. is 150 yrs. old.

	Cttee. of Privy Council think this is minimum.



P.M.	Odious design expressing nothg. but spite, malice, ill-will and monstrosity.

	Words (Red Dragon takes the lead) are untrue and unduly flattering to Bevan.



Ll.G.	Wd. rather be on R. Arms.  This (dating from Henry VII) will be somethg.



	We get no recognition in Union – badge or flags.



J.S.	Regimental use.  Refused in Scotland.  Shd. be re-considered.



M.F.	This is only suggn., for discussion.



							            [Exit Ll.G.

		8.	Education. Adult Studies.			[Enter F.H.



P.M.	No cuts save in arts classes doesn’t reassure me.



F.H.	It’s “cultural” and crafts classes – not humanities.

	This was a leakage to N. Statesman by W.E.A. – who have now apologised.



R.A.B.	Will support M/Ed.  But leakage was most unfortunate.



F.H.	Outside bodies must be given advance warning because of academic year.

	Am seeing a deputn. : will seek joint statement deprecating the premature publicity.



R.A.B.	Aim at making it up by continuing provision but charging higher fees.
