C.C. 69 (53)				                                                         23rd November, 1953



				                                                   [Enter 3 Serv. Min., O.P.

129.	    Uganda.



O.L.	Govr. says tht. if K. comes here he mustn’t return – for there wd. be demonsn. at airport.  Can’t over-ride him.  Propose therefore tht. we shd. depose him there &amp; give him chance of coming here on appeal.

	If he wishes to appeal to me, he can come to U.K.  Then he wd. know tht., if appeal disallowed, he cd. not return to Uganda.



P.M.	The dusk of Imperialism - v. sad period for us.



			Agreed.





1.	    Service Officers: Retired Pay.



R.A.B.	Right decn . d. be to say “no”.  For much interest in pensions.

		Also C.S. pension’s cd. not be changed w’out legn. – and debate wd. focus attentn. on other claims.

	Alternative (because of pol. pressure) :  isolate Crown Servant cases.

	Seed-bed statement wdn’t do because wd. involve saying no concession to others for some time to come.  V. dangerous politically.

	If anything therefore make the concession but try to insulate it.

Bill : title wd. be drawn to confine it to pensions cut in ’35.

	Choice:	a) M’tain refusal, as I recommend, for the present.

b) Make concession to Crown Servants, but insulate it.

	Circulated draft statement on basis of (b).



Al.	Have always contended tht. Crown Servants cd. be isolated – on basis of restoring a cut made.

	Pressure for this is not limited to Tory side.



Sal.	Wise – act of justice – if it can be isolated.



A.E.	Politically, will rouse much trouble.  Constituencies are full of talk about o.a.p. and c/living.  That is main issue in country now.  I wd. m’tain refusal.



M.F.	I am opposed to it – for same reasons.  Will do Party gt. harm.



P.M.	If you make a concession, statement cd. be much shortened.  Last ten lines of draft wd. suffice.

	See wisdom of waiting until it can be mixed up with other things.



O.L.	Don’t agree tht. civilians are on all fours – because gratuity, retirement at later age, Army Officers pre-war cdn’t live w’out pr. means.



Sal.	Can’t dogmatise about feeling in constituencies.  But this claim is a good one.  And can’t defend p’ponement, as they are dying while we wait.



Sim.	Why can’t Crown Servants be isolated?  Are they not unique?

Can’t you stand there.  It is a logical dividing line.



P.M.	Is this right moment?  Injustice has continued for many years.



J.T.	Agitn. fr. all Parties.  Doesn’t that indicate repercussions cd. be held?



de L.	Held back while Labour was in because they were egalitarian Govt.



J.T.	Lead by Ogmore in H/L &amp; many Socialist supporters in H/C.



F.H.	Then they will say :  now you can do more &amp; root for police, o.a.p. etc.



A.E.	Pension’s is now such a burning ques.



J.S.	How long before it cd. be dealt with in conjunctn. with other pensions.



O.P.	They are 20% below 1946 values, when rates fixed.  Contemplate restoration by spring of 1955.

	Cd. hold position for 12-18 mos. if c/l. rises no  more &amp; no break made elsewhere in the front.



W.	Political diffy. of giving money to Generals, who need it less than o.a.p.  Public won’t listen to argument of injustice.



R.A.B.	I am ready to meet repves. of H/L. and H/C. and to explain why we can’t do this.



Sal.	Don’t accept tht. there is no hardship.  That assumes tht. no inequality of income is tolerable.



P.M.	Decision must be deffered.

But we will re-consider in 6 months.

Defend inaction m’while on basis tht. we can’t select this when so many other [cases/demands of hardship] are pressing on us &amp; when there is genl. &amp; continuing need for public economy.

	Reply in both Houses:  In H/C. by P.M.
