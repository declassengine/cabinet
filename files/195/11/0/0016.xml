C.C. 8(53)							10th February, 1953



		1.	Coronation Oath.				[Enter H.G., McL.



P.M.	Times &amp; Manchr. Guardian articles.  Ques. shd. be re-considered.

	Cd. we not add a clause to Titles Bill.



Sim.	Oath prescribed in 1688 has bn. modified several times to accord with constitutional change – both Church and Commonwealth – and always without legn.



		Agreed : Sim. to consider and report.





		2.	Coal Prices:	Public Expenditure.



P.M.	Ty. gets £9 M. out of this increase in price.  Is this right?  (Income tax).



W.M.	Food Prices.  Concerned about wages increases in ’53.  We have held c/l. index for 3 mos. &amp; likely to do so for another month.  Employers say however tht. they won’t be able to hold wages (either in negotn. or at arbitn.) if food prices rise.  Accept need to remove food subsidies in this Parlt.  Proposed here that margarine shd. rise and milk (wh. otherwise drop ½d.) stand as now.  It’s household costs wh. impel earners to seek rises.



	Coal Prices.  To increase exports we must keep wages fr. rising.  My plan in C.49 is compromise betw. 2 views at last Cabinet.  Want to avoid practice of automatic reflectn. in prices of all wage increases.

	Two objns. raised to my plan.  i) 5% increase in productivity won’t wipe out deficit : too optimistic.  [I don’t want to intervene in wage dispute : only afterwards.  Times article on absenteeism in Yorks.  4.1 shifts last year cpd. with national average : if they came up to average, wd. get 2 m. tons of coal.]



L.	Productivity increase needed wd. be nearer 20%.  And many mines are now at maximum output – can’t handle more if men worked it.

	Also many are producing at uneconomic cost - £1 to 30/= over selling price.

	N.U.M. are prepd. to co-operate in getting larger output.  Much done already on line suggd. in M/L. memo.  That effort is under way.

	But what will it produce?  Losing £3 m. a month now, on deficit.



G.H.	Tax.  N.C.B. write off equipmt. at faster rate than Revenue allow.  Many industries do the same.  Can’t therefore get as business allowance the full rate of depreciation.



R.A.B.	They are in same position as private industry – and should be.



O.L.	All cos. have to set aside for replacement of plant more sums than they are allowed in tax relief.



R.A.B.	Trying to steer course betwn. policy of financiers, who want drastic cuts to reduce taxation, and need to avoid provoking wage increases.

	Shall be said by our Party tht. we haven’t done enough.  All we have done is to prevent expend’re. from rising.  With help of M/F. I can hope to keep a level in ’53.  Won’t satisfy our supporters.

	While we continue with Defence, Housing &amp; Soc. Services we can’t achieve reduction in exp’re.  Rent Bill will therefore be valuable for confidence.  Similarly dangerous to subsidise natd. industries.

	Having failed to cut exp’re. back as much as we ought, we mustn’t funk this.  Won’t have bad effect on natl. economy.  Coal prices are not high.  Exports prices are now 25/= p. ton higher in price than domestic.



L.	Trade won’t bear a higher export price.  Sellers’ market is fading.



R.A.B.	Steel : export price is £13. 10.0 p.ton higher than domestic .

	Must avoid impression tht. we are putting wages cost on State.

	Moreover, don’t believe Govt. intervention with miners will succeed – more likely to involve us in pol. diffies.

	We cdn’t hope for 20% increase in productivity.  Dishonest to talk on that basis.



W.M.	Even if you can’t cover the whole of it, why not ask industry (both sides) what part they cd. cover.  Don’t be automatic.



P.T.	Agree no subsidy on coal.  M/L. doesn’t suggest it.

	Don’t believe dearer coal (domestic) will make increased exports easier.

	Exp’re. £146 M. above last year.  Not holding it steady, over-all.

	Our critics will say : we are takg. £150 M. extra for defence &amp; not makg. room for it – just adding it to everything else.



	Can’t relieve industrial taxn. when supply exp’re. is rising.

	Only 2 chances for cuts  i) Housing subsidy.  £61M. p.a. on subsidising rents for people with cars, television &amp; in some cases surtax.  Doesn’t affect housing target.  ii) Food subsidies.  £63M. left excldg. welfare.  £38M. on milk.  Is that justified? – for adults.

	And another £25M. of oddments.  We shall be attacked for cereals &amp; eggs : no more criticism if we did more.

	If you are to incur unpopularity, do it now rather than later.

	I want more than R.A.B. proposes.



P.M.	We are in defence emergency.  That, added to other p’mmes. Wd. have justified paying for it out of Budget surpluses by slowing down repayment of National Debt.  Finance by loan or by retarding loan-repayments.

	Rising costs &amp; wages may bring us a more serious situation.



Ch.	Eng. prodn. worth £450 p.ton of steel.  Rise in cost of coal &amp; steel doesn’t have much effect – less than 1d. in £.



P.M.	Read memo. by Cherwell.  Shows that whole of deficit cd. not be wiped out by increased productivity.



W.M.	Gain in understanding by workers generally, if ⅓rd of deficit cd. be met by extra work.  And wdn’t forfeit good-will of miners.



O.L.	Price of coal must be raised, to some extent.  But ready for M/L. to try along lines recommended.  Rise in productivity, if it comes at all, will come v. slowly.  Can’t live on deficit budgeting.

	We cd. discuss what the price increase should be.



W.M.	Ready to compromise as long as we avoid automatic reflection of wage increases in prices.



L.	Miners’ leaders realise now tht. increased productivity is essential to any new increase in wages.  Ground for some optimism.



H.C.	Risk of Govt. intervening.  My experience is that it never pays.

	If we subsidise, and can’t recover it w’in a year, we shd. end by continuing subsidy to mining.  It is a v. slippery slope.  Bedevilled mining between the wars.  Support R.A.B.



Sim.	What is most tht. M/L. hopes for?



W.M.	Not more than ⅓rd.



H.G.	Automatic reflection in prices may have bad effect on miners.



McL.	Rise in prices is inevitable.  Link it with wages in public mind.

	Wd. like to believe in coming increase in productivity : but don’t fancy our chance of getting it.



P.M.	Genl. body of support for R.A.B.’s approach.  Confirm it finally at next mtg.  M’while, P.T., W.M., and others shd. discuss with R.A.B. wthr. we shd. delay a month before we fix actual amount of increase.   Make clear at once need for increase.  



R.A.B. 	Ready to meet at 3.30 pm. today.



							[Exit G.H.

	Public Expenditure.



McL.	Doctors wdn’t work the suggn. made by J.S. – they wdn’t indicate which was prescribed for which complaint.



R.A.B.	Paragraph 9. (a).  Not in Estimates, but in Budget.  Won’t make big

             x/	different in c/l index.  Cab. can look at it again before Budget so long as they approve it in principle now.



W.M.	Wd. like to discuss with R.A.B. – it’s .3 of 1% on index.  



H.G.  	With eggs &amp; flour might reach 1 point.



	b) P’pone : consider later.

	c) Means ½d. on meat.  But cd. all go on dearer cuts : the cheaper cuts mght cost less.               Agreed.

	d) Agreed : shd. be examined.  



H.G.  	Stress need for care.

	£364M. contn. thro’ subsidy.  Another big slice this year wd. give us trouble.

	Milk consumptn. has dropped 2% overall and 6% in larger families.



R.A.B.	Have a plan for milk – for next year, not this.  M/Ag. can’t take it yet.



P.T.	Can we then look at the other £25 M.?  {Also needs Marketing scheme.

	

P.M.	e) Do this now.  For you can say it’s to reduce abuse.



McL.	I proposed this : only quick means of checking uncontrolled expendit’re.



	Awkward time because of floods. 



J.S.	We failed a year ago, apparently.  Awkward to have to admit it.

	Esp. when we are about to launch a general enquiry.



P.M.	Must have a row on something.  



H.C. 	It was a row with our side last year.  Deprecate doing it now.  Cdn’t do it in March.  Aprl. or May (floods, then elections).  Leave it to the enquiry.



J.S.	Agree : wait for Cohen Cttee.  Do all you can by adminve. action.



W.M.	Won’t satisfy as many of our people as we upset.



M.F.	Para. 5 is discouraging.  Not worth another row for £6 m.



H.C.	Cd. do it later.  Legn. is not required.  

O.L.  	I agree.



		Agreed : Wait.  That carries (f).



	(g).  Approved.					[Exit H.G. &amp; McL

							[Enter 3 Serv Ministers.



		3.	National Service.



P.M.	No escape from this now.



	Wd. have healthy effect in U.S. &amp; N.A.T.O.



R.A.B.	Reserve my position on bounties for men re-called.  Will communicate on that with M/Def.



A.H.	Puts us worse off (reserve liability) for cold war needs.  Wd. like to find means of calling them w’out refce. to imminent emergency.



Ch.	Can in presentnn. – can be put as alleviation : avoid appearance of addl. imposition.



							[Exit Serv. Ministers.

		4.	East West Trade.			[Enter S.H. &amp; Foster.



R.A.B.	Will consult O.L. on transhipment controls.

	Subject to this, memo approved.



		5.	Japan and G.A.T.T.			



P.T.	We obtd. no support for our plan.

	Secretariat has now put up proposal – on much same lines but involvg. getting permn. of Contr. Parties before we discriminate.

	Suggest we try to get this amended, to knock out permn.  If this fails let plan be reported back to Govts.

	If that fails, merely a report saying what was discussed etc.,



S.H.	And try to force U.S. to show hand before we adjourn.



R.A.B.	Link with Art. 19 vice 23.





		6.	Pekin Economic Conference.



P.M.	Agree – don’t think it worth antagonising U.S. for small trade involved.



	New line appd.
