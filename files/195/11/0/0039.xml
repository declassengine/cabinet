C.C. 31 (53)					14th May, 1953



10.	    Parliament.

			                                       [Enter B-H., F.H., Solr. Genl., S.Ll.

H.C.	Business for next week.

	Whitsun &amp; Coronation adjournment:  From 22nd. May until 9th. June.





1.	    Education Bill.



Solr. G.	In Cttee. amendmt. passed wh. was inoperative – in order to stage debate on grant to R. C. schools.  We ought to remove these useless words on Report – in order to avoid misconceptn. of Minister’s powers.  Danger that this wd. lead to general debate on R.C. ques. – the R.C.’s are trying to get more.

Some of our supporters mght. w’hold vote on divn. – tho’ progress may be expected in whipping them in.

	But we cd. choose betwn.

i)	allowg. amendmt. to be negatived, having made our posn. clear or

ii)	risking a divn.  

		If we follow course (i), matter might arise again in H/L.



B.H.	As many as 16 might abstain.  Safer to do (i) unless during debate we can whip some of these doubters in.



F.H.	R.C.’s have asked for this clause since ’44.  Labour Govt. refused it.  now we have done it, Opposn. want to cash in by supportg. R.C. request.

	I think we must wait &amp; see, as B-H. proposes : &amp; put it to Divn. if we are sure we can carry it.



R.A.B.	Bill gives £200.000 p.a. to R.C.’s:  they are trying to get another £200,000.

If we gave it, the other denominations wd. run out on agreement.

	If M/E. will say what schools are covered, in opening of statement, we may get our doubters unto lobby.



Solr. G.	The words are meaningless.  They may mislead, if present Bill is read alone.  Also H/L. may clean them up.



P.M.	No undue risks shd. be run.

					[Exit F.H.



1.	    Salaries of Members.

13)	

H.C.	H.M. has asked for free vote on motion for Select Cttee.

	Precedent:  on 1st. motn. of salaries &amp; 28th. increase whips were on : but not on 2nd increase.

	I favour a free vote.

B.H.	So do I.  Believe our supporters wd. be content with that.



H.M.	May depend on form of motion.



P.M.	Better see it first – but indicate our disposn. to leave to free Vote.



Sal.	Repns. from Opposn. in favour of expenses to members of H/L.

Put them off.  But now our supporters have pressed it on me too.

	If Sel. Cttee. apptd. re H/C., I cdn’t hold posn. in H/L.  We shd. have to yield to pressure for Select Cttee. in H/L.



P.M.	We cd. take a decn. on a view when report of Cttee. was received.



R.A.B.	Junior Ministers’ posn. is most urgent of all.



Sal.	If this goes thro’ in H/C., can I let it be known tht. we wd. not oppose a Sel. Cttee. in H/L.



P.M.	Yes.





1.	    Judges’ Salaries.



Sim.	Ch. Whip &amp; I saw Exec Cttee. of 1922.  I wholly failed to persuade them in favour of tax-free allowance.  But, on whole, they were sympathetic twd. increase – tho’ many thought a net £1,000 was too much.

They talked of increased pensions, expenses allowances etc.

Want it kept out of Party controversy – wd. mtg. with Opposn be fruitful.

	They wanted me to talk to ’22 Cttee. as a whole.



P.M.	Points twds R.A.B. latest plan – tho’ I still believe first plan was the better.



R.A.B.	I will now go into details &amp; circulate detailed proposals.





1.	    Monopolies Bill.



P.T.	Chairman retires in 1954 &amp; I can’t get another good enough w’out a pension.

	Shd. have to drop our plan to cover stat. monopolies.  We have agreed to leave out marketg. bds. : steel is going back : transport is a service.



P.M.	Cd. say we wished to bring them in : but Bill can only go thro’ on basis of agreemt. with Opposn. in present Parly congestion.



M.F.	Para 3 – second half – is a good argument to use.

Sal.	Support M.F.  Our pledge was absolute.  Stress alternative method.



H.C.	No time unless.

					[Exit B-H.

					[Enter H.H.

1.	    Japan and G.A.T.T.

16)	

P.T.	Prefer Ministerial Cttee.

	Merits.

i)	Japan’s entry will damage our trading interests.

ii)	If we vote in principle in favour of J.’s admission, it means legn. here to implement the safeguards.  We shd. be in grave trouble.

iii)	F.O. arguments are powerful.  But we cd. easily start an anti-J. campaign here wh. wd. be v.serious, by takg. unwise line in Geneva.

iv)	Discn. at Geneva in Sept.  Doms may ask us for guidance in July.  Diff. to justify extendg. our obligns. unless U.S. change policy violently.



	Keep them out:     Sal., W., W.M., H.M., L., M-F,

	Let them in:           No offers.

	On the fence:         R.A.B. (If we cd. have just a little longer)



			Agreed:  Cab. Cttee. to be appointed.

					[Exit HH.

					[Enter T.D. &amp; J.T.

1.	    Iceland Fisheries Dispute.



			Agreed.		[Exit T.D.





1.	    Egypt.



S.Ll.	Will M/D consider Press Officer needs in Canal Zone. 



Al.	Yes.



P.M.	Cairo 793.  Dulles’ attitude is not so bad.

	Drew attentn. to be in Tunis y’dy.  Also in Robertson’s personl. message.

	Arrangemts made by Def. Cttee.  Commando Brigade from Malta : some destroyers : but don’t contemplate a [premature] Rodeo at present.  Atrocities wd. create atmosph.  in wh. we cd. be rougher.

M’while sit still &amp; do nothg., as Robertson recommends.

	Most disturbing developmt. is 1.000 Muslim Brothers in parties of 40/50 each under Nazi Hun.  But v. popular to arrest them.

Must be alert v. large scale sabotage.



Sal.	Feeling in Ldn re Dulles is bad.  Cd. we give him a pat.



P.M.	Mght read it in H/C.



Al &amp; Others	It wd. provoke many ques.



Sw.	Then let us give some guidance to Press.  (F.O.)
