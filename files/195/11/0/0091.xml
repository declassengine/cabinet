C.C. 8(54).				10th February, 1954.



	1.	Parliament:  Japanese Trade Agreement.	[Enter  B-H., S.Ll.

			                                             P.1395 of O. Paper of 10/2.



H.C.	Jap. Trade Agreemt.  Tory amendment to Labour motion.



P.T.	Advantageous to accept this.  Get Assheton to make a moderate

		speech.  I cd. indicate our limitns. – e.g. as regards Colonies,

		wh. we can’t direct.



RAB.	We shd. in any case watch its opn. over coming year:  no reason why 

		we shdn’t accept.  Cd. O.L. take it?



O.L.	Amendmt. safeguards Col. posn. sufficiently.



P.T.	Interests of textile indies. are in exports to Col. :  we can’t ensure that :

		But we can do our best.  Will make it clear tht. we can’t compel

		Col. decisions.



O.L.	If you make this clear, I cd. take whatever risk there may be.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.



Sim.	Judges Bill?



H.C.	Party have now linked it with officers’ retired pay.

	    	Unless we clear that before Army Estimates, there will be 

		trouble.



R.A.B.	If large increases are made in Service pay, we shall have to make the

		concession on pensions.



P.M.	What about M.P.’s salaries?  Is not that connected too?



Sal.	Get them all over together.



W.M.	And not during my crisis from 20th. Feb. to mid-March.

		Engineering is crucial :  bldg. less so.  Once they are over, we

		shall be thro’ this round at about 7/= a week.



Sim.	Judges really shd. be differentiated from all others.



Sal.	Allowances for Peers.  Can’t be held unless M.P.’s salaries are not

		raised.



P.M.	Leave M.P.’s and Peers out of this.

		But consider the others jointly.

			                                                     [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers.

	3.	Service Pay.



Sal.	Proposals of Cttee.



W.M.	To effect their purpose, increases must be attractive.  Increases 

		fr. 14/= to 49/= - embarrassing when I am aiming at a 7/=

		increase.  I want to be sure tht. none of these are greater than

		industry has had since last Service pay increase in 1950.

		Must have time to consider that point – 24 hrs.

	On presentn. and timing, I may have more to say.



P.M.	Doubt if we can get thro’ debates on Service Estimates w’out an

		announcement on this.



de L.	Rises in comparable civil earnings (e.g. aircraft manufacture) have 

		been much larger over the whole period from 1950.



H.C.	Industrial wages are not incentives to continued skilled service.



P.M.	Can’t avoid this addn. to M/L.’s difficulties.  Must announce before

		Service Estimates.



R.A.B.	Wish it recorded tht. £8 M. wd. have bn. a sufficient settlement.

		I am not in agreemt. with this plan for £16.5 M.



P.T.	Bad effect on Br. industry.



P.M.	Cab. must take responsibility for decision.



W.M.	Accept date of 4/3.

	Still want to examine detailed rates.



       Agreed.	P.M.		Cab. will meet to-morrow, if M/L. or R.A.B. want to

			raise points on further examination.



P.M.	Wdn’t worsen M/L. posn. if we then cleared up officers’ retired pay

		&amp; proceed thereafter with Judges’ Bill.



R.A.B.	Want to submit memo.



H.C.	And I wish to consider timing – in detail.





	4.	Five-Power Conference.



P.M.	Para. 7 of A.E.’s telegram.



S.Ll.	U.S. proposal is unfortunate – in terms &amp; in notn.  But it is furthest

		he can go, he says.  Urge A.E. to get D. to modify terms.

		But at all costs avoid open breach with U.S. &amp; France.



Sal.	Must keep w. front unbroken.  Try to get D. as far as we can.



P.M.	Don’t commit ourselves needlessly to defending awkward posns.

		taken by D. – e.g. “conduct” vice “action”.  Can’t be expected 

		to agree on every point.  Not bound always to speak with one

		voice with U.S.

	We can’t hope to defend here posns. wh. he took up v. his better

		judgmt.



H.M.	B. is more important than D.  There will be failure on G.  B.’s only

		hope of carrying E.D.C. is to have our full support.  I am 

		therefore more impressed by importance of not being seen to

		disagree with B.’s attitude.  We must strengthen him.



S.Ll.	We can’t defend having no discn. on F/E.  And that must be made

		clear to D.



P.M.	Fact (of Confce.) is more important than form.

		Do best you can.  We will support you.

		Doesn’t follow tht. we must endorse every word

		used by D. or B.

				[Enter  ALB. &amp; C.O.S.

				[Exit  B-H.

	5.	Egypt.



Sim.	This is next best course to getting an agreement.  Cttee. believe tht.

		considn. emphasises advantages of getting an agreement.

		cf. A.E.’s telegram.



P.M.	That means further concessions.



Sim.	Even so.



Sim.	On the law – we can’t predict what decn. an internatl. court might

		take.  But we are satisfied tht. there are plausible arguments 

		wh. we could put fwd.



P.M.	A.E.’s tel. was unnecessarily alarmed.  We shall not decide to-day.

	A.E. is ready to contemplate further concessions.  Cab. has said 

		h’to. it wd. not make any further offer.  Serious trouble from 

		Party if we did.

	Consider the weak points in alternative plan.

	Either course wd. look v. much the same.  Large nos. of troops wd.

		be leaving – wtr we relied on Base or on Treaty.  Neguib cd.

		point to departing Br. troops.  E. mght well think they need

		not impede that part of the basis.  No need to assume violent 

		attacks or hostility.  But, if that did occur, our posn. here wd. be

		easier – we shd. have more support for a stiffer attitude, which

		(militarily) we cd. easily take.



C.I.G.S.	Eventual posn. concerns me most.  10,000 concentrated with l/c

		unguarded.



P.M.	But if they were attacked it wd. be act of war :  &amp; we cd. re-inforce.



CIGS.	Shd. we be able to use air-arm v. Egyptian forces.



P.M.	What of our resolution to launch Rodeo – 96 hrs’ notice for wks. at

		end.  That wd. have bn. much more serious act.

	We must work further on this plan.	[Exit  L.P., de L., P.T.

	E.g. how do we justify saying Base doesn’t matter?



Al.	Done our best to secure it.  As E. have made it imposs., we are 

		moving it to posns. which, tho’ less ideal, are more workable

		because friendlier population etc.,



Sim.	Course (c) contemplated decln. we were re-treatg on Treaty rights.

		Our local people think that wd. arouse E. antagonism.

		But we cdn’t handle Party w’out such a reference.



M.F.	Para. 5 is important point.  We have time to w’draw &amp; to protect

		ourselves m’while.



P.M.	Continue to study alternative in this memo.

		Construct mil. and pol. time-table from a D. day.

		(e.g. at what point do we declare our policy)



CIGS.	Assumg. for tht. purpose tht. 10,000 need not be wholly

		w’in Treaty areas – relying on argument at end of

		para. 5.



S.Ll.	We cd. make privately to E. Govt. a rather different

		statement from that which we make publicly.

		Incldg. ultimatum to E. tht. if they attack us

		m’while it will be an act of war.



P.M.	What of other course of further concessions to obtain agreemt?

		V. weak course, after we have made it plain tht. these were our 

		last words.  Are we to yield to E. when we declined to shift on

		a/c of U.S. pressures?



Sim.	I wd. go a long way to get agreemt.



S.Ll.	A new availability formula might be improvemt. fr. our pt. of view, 

		not a concession.  E.g. Turkey vice U.N.

	On uniform:  no E. civil jurisdn. &amp; right to carry arms mght be better

		than uniforms.

	These changes, not concessions, might be examined.



P.M.	Examine both alternatives.



H.M.	Will an agreement extracted fr. us by E. do us any good in M/E.

		Shall we do ourselves any good in eyes of other M/E. countries.

	More long-term advantage in the alternative course.

				[Exit  C.O.S., J.T.



	6.	Railways:  Freight Charges.



A.L.B.	As in memo.



RAB.	No alternative.

	Reserve my position on alternative method of financing.  Will consider

		on merits.



P.M.	Will there be outcry?



J.S.	Yes.  There seems to be no end to it.



	Other Ministers agreed with this view.



M.F.	Hope tht. in debate M/T. can give some hope of future offsets thro’

		efficiency etc.



ALB.	Will try.  But T.U.’s have a stranglehold on rlways.

				        [Re-enter  CIGS,

				          P.T., Sal.

	7.	Kenya.



P.M.	Talk in Press – e.g. D. Mirror.  Much in this general argument –

		executions shd. serve a public service.



O.L.	Justice or expediency?

	Genl. China did not surrender under terms of amnesty.

	Expediency :  disastrous to respite such an outstanding leader merely

		because he surrendered.  Govr. thinks effect on public opinion

		wd. be disastrous.



P.M.	What of Govr.’s last para.  He wd. reprieve if the man gave informn.

		or induced others to surrender.  This is no more reputable a

		motive than mine (viz., to encourage surrender).



O.L.	I don’t agree with last para.  Unless he came in with 4.000 followers 

		or so.



O.L.	Second case is difft.  For man claims tht. he voluntarily surrendered

		under amnesty.  If that is substantiated, he must be reprieved.

	Is our policy appeasement or deterrence?



P.M.	Execution of men who fight to defend their native land…...



O.L.	But this is armed rebellion.



O.L.	Let me say Ch. can’t be commuted because didn’t

		surrender under amnesty.  If it is proved tht. the

		other man did, he will be commuted.

				[Enter  I. McL.

				[Exit  AH., C.I.G.S.

	8.	Smoking &amp; Cancer.



		Memo. approved.



P.M.	Will you publish the facts?



I.McL.	Shd. meet the Press after announcemt.



P.M.	You shd. publish the report.	[Exit  McL.





	9.	Betting :  Pools Bill.



M.F.	Comment tht. Govt. did not announce policy on Pools Bill.

	Will be another opportunity on Friday.

	Govt. will suffer if we don’t make our view known then on 

		Pools Bill.



			Agreed.





	10.	Royal Tour.



P.M.	Had thght previously tht. it wd. be better if she didn’t go.

	Ceylon Govt. now think that she shd. go.

	Queen is disposed to go.  Thinks it wd. be courteous to her

		Buddhist subjects to remove her shoes.
