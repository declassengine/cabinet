C.C. 7(53)							5th February, 1953



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H., D.E.



H.C.	Business for next week.



		2.	Historic Houses.



H.C.	Motion only urges early legn. to give effect to objects of Gowers Rpt.

	“If time permits”.  It won’t before the summer.

	M’while, L.P. has raised the major issue again.

	Legn. Cttee. has agreed a line for Govt. spokesman (Molson) on Motions.  He cd. repeat P.M.’s assurance on Debate on Address : can’t indicate what Bill wd. do : mght promise a White Paper.



.A.B.	Don’t want to raise major issue on L.P.’s absence.

	Aug. – announced we shd. make some money available.

	Cab. agreed on a Bill. 21/10.  P.M. foreshadowed it in Parlt.

	Why shdn’t we promise the legn. on Friday.

	Tax reliefs cd. be done in Budget – tho’ I wdn’t favour it.



P.M.	Impressed by L.P.’s memo.

	There is a view – opposed to Socialist idea of grants – which is more congenial to Tory Party.

	Can’t settle this in L.P.’s absence.  Can’t announce in Friday’s debate somethg. which wd. prejudge full considn. of his alternative.

	Surely we can temporise on Friday.



D.E.	Even with tax remission, there wd. have to be grants as well.  Some of the families haven’t a big enough gross income to run on basis of tax reliefs.



B.H.	Promise W.Paper this session – legn. next session if not earlier?



		[P.M.	Let D.E. and then J.S. speak to L.P.  Suggest he can 	speak to P.M.]



		Agreed :  M/W. to speak himself on Friday &amp; temporise.





		3.	Arms for Wales.



M.F.	Pressure for some time : inclusion in R. Arms rejected in 1910 by Cttee. of Pr. Council.  New Cttee. have now rejected separate arms for Wales.  But recommend tht. existing Badge (since 1800) shd. have Crown and motto added &amp; approved.

	Want it issued by St. David’s Day.



P.M.  	Bring it up next week.



		4.	Housing Policy.



H.M.	If anything is to be done this year, Cab. Authy. is needed to prepare Bill.

	The important points of policy can be reserved, while structure of Bill is prepared.

	Want it introduced in May : taken in Cttee. upstairs, &amp; sent to H/L. in Aug.

	Let us also have a Cttee. of Ministers (as for Steel &amp; Transport Bill) which can bring to Cab. the issues of policy wh. emerge.

	Cdn’t deal with rent save v. background of rising results in new house bldg.



P.M.	Proceed with drafting of both Bills.

	Appoint Cttee. to supervise and report to Cabinet.	)	Agreed.

	L.P.S., H.M., J.S., M/W., M/H., Econ. Secy. Ty.	)



R.A.B.	Want Rent Bill early.  Will strengthen Budget position.

	Urge speed in prepn. and decision.



H.M.	Favour W.Paper covering whole policy and Rent Bill in May.



R.A.B.	Better still in April, if possible.

	Exchequer liability on rescue work.  Must be related to cost on new housing – Cttee. shd. be careful over this point.



Ch.		i)  Plan as it stands is v. hard on landlord : some aspects need review.

		ii)  £180M. p.a. now on repairs.  Serious if that were doubled.  Wd. 			draw off too much fr. new bldg.

		Hope Cttee. will consider i) and ii).



B.H.	We are 15 days behind on Legislve. P’mme.

	Avoid any public indicn. of legn. on this.

		

							[Exit D.E. B.H.

		5.	Coronation Oath.



M.F.	As in memo.

	The 1910 Act was necessary – to authorise a less militantly	Protestant attitude in the Accession Declaration.



P.M.	Very well.





		6.	Royal Title.



P.M.	Why have a Latin Title?  What’s wrong with English.

	Record my preference for English. – even on Great Seal.

		Lord Chancellor’s alternative for Latin version.

							                 [Enter H.G.  R.

		7.	Argentine Credit.



R.	We don’t contest any more.  Accept it for F.O. vote.

		

							[Exit H.G.

		8.	Peking Economic Conference.



P.T.	Object is Comm. propaganda.  Advise as in last para.



R.             x/	Tell them (4(1)) tht. by attending they will lend themselves to Comm. propaganda.

	Para. 3.  There is more serious objn.  Reversal of policy followed on Moscow Confce. mght confuse opinion here &amp; raise doubts in NATO about our cold-war sincerity.  T.U.C., who backed us before, may be embarrassed.  But trade with China is diffnt. 



P.T.	Doubtful about x/.  You shd. then advise him not to go.  Enough to warn him about risks.



Ch.	Cd. say Moscow led to v. little trade in fact.



R.A.B.	We can police trade better if it’s handled by reputable firms.



P.T.	Agree : tendency now to get it into doubtful channels.



P.M.	Opposn. will construe it as move in favour of Comm. China.



Al.	U.S. won’t like it.  Strassen spoke of it y’day.



P.T.	No relaxn. of reslns. on strategic goods.



P.M.	Over 1½ m. U.S. troops have bn. under fire in Korea (because of quick rotation) – involves families totalling 7½ m. American people.  They are sensitive about our tenderness to China, incldg. our recognition.

	Review, fr. angle of effect on U.S. opinion, our genl. attitude to China and F/E. policy.  Review this in light of U.S. re-action to our statement on Formosa.



P.T.	We ban more exports to China than any other Eur. country.

	I will discuss this further with A.E. in light of latest state of U.S. opinion &amp; bring it up again to Cab. on Tuesday.



							[Enter D.S. Watk., G.H.

		9.	Coal Prices.



L.	N.U.M. rejected offer by N.C.B.  They will not appeal to Govt.  They will ask for the 6/= award to extend to a larger no. of workers, involving increase of additional £2¼M. in cost.  They recognise tht. Sat. work must go on for another year : and that stoppage etc., must cease if NCB is to pay its way.  This recommn. will be made to large mtg. on 12/2.

	N.U.M. have suggd. joint visits to coal-fields, with N.C.B., to get better spirit &amp; more work.  Better spirit fr. N.U.M.

	With all this, I think N.C.B. cd. give the 6/= to the additional men.

	This increases my case for 10% increase in prices (because award will cost £2¼ m. more).  Deficit for ’53 was previously thought to be £36M. will now be more.  But 10% increase is all I ask for.



Wat.	This wage award will be regarded as hang-over fr. ’52.  Don’t oppose it.  But past promises of miners for increased output have not bn. met.

	5% increase in productivity wd. wipe out deficit by end/53.  Cdn’t we hold it over miners’ heads as incentive to work harder?

	Wage increases in ’52 cost £232 m.  Don’t want to add more of that to export prices.

	

R.A.B.	Don’t relish idea of carrying deficit by taxn.  Policy is to make people pay econ. prices.

Don’t like carrying deficit on natd. industry.

	But we must explain it – not wholly on wages.

	Effect on c/living : only ¼ of 1% at first followed by similar secondary effect.  Less than M/L. estimate.

	Must show public we aren’t putting natd. indies. on backs of taxpayer.



P.M.	M/L. memo. appeals to me.  Serious repercussions.  Delay might help us to extract a spurt fr. miners.  Hold it over their heads for a year.

	The other users will take opportunity to increase prices above level of coal cost.



P.T.	Support that view.  There wd. be 12/= more on steel.  Transport etc.,

	Runs thro’ whole economy, at a time when we are trying to make our costs competitive.



L.	Better chance of getting miners to work if we don’t carry this on taxation but let public opinion re-act from increased prices.



Watk.	We didn’t mean to take it on Exchequer.



R.A.B.	The cost while you delay will come on Exchequer (unless eventual price increase is larger).

P.M.	Don’t fancy the pressure by making the people hate the miners.

	They are impervious to abuse, but not to flattery.

	Will miners’ leaders advise us to pass this on to consumers?

	This is a critical year – dangerous to risk round of price/wage increases.



H.M.	If miners work better &amp; coal prices are reduced at end/year, you won’t then get the other prices down.



Ch.	You won’t be able to justify price increase on basis of this wage award.



L.	There is already £21M. accumulated wages payments, apart from this £6 m., which we haven’t recovered from public.



Wat.	Cd. M/L. consult miners’ leaders, in consultn. with L.?



R.A.B.	NCB provide for £3 m. for increase prodn. – in estimate for next year.

	How can you expect them to make up another £30M. or so?



P.M.	May be better to pay out of Exchequer than cause econ. repercussions.



R.A.B.	Economists think increase in price of coal mght help the economy &amp; get more into exports.



D.S.	12/= a ton on steel wd. mean £9M. to steel consumers.



O.L.	Inflationary risk of delaying price increase.  Caution.



Wat.	Put the alternatives to NUM (&amp; NCB) when the wages award has been settled.



R.A.B.	No hope of getting £30M. or so addl. profits out of N.C.B. in  ’53.

	A dishonest negotiation.



P.M.  	No decision until next week.





		10.	Steel Prices.



D.S.	Small increases on certain types of steel.



R.A.B.	Only suggd. at E.P.C. tht. he shd. come to Cab. because of 12/= rise on a/c of coal.  He cd. do this smaller.
