C.C. 7(54).				3rd February, 1954.



	1.	Parliament.                          [ B-H., A.H., de L., ALB., S.Ll., J.T.



H.C.	Debate on Sydney Conference on 4/2.  Because politically 

		impossible to go on with Ind. Organisation &amp; Development Bill.



P.M.	Imp. Pref.  Make it clear tht. Govt. haven’t changed their view but 

		no-one else in Comm. wants an extension of Pref. at present time.



P.T.	Serious diffies. with Party over my Bill.  Extends purposes to cover

		levies for productive efficiency.  Organised industry has accepted

		it.  Party objects however to levies for any purpose wh. it regards

		as Socialist.  

	x/	It is, however, our alternative to Dev. Councils.

	Propose now to sound FBI. – to see wtr they wd. openly support 

		Bill on basis of x/.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Jap. Trade Agreement – on adjournment 9/2.



RAB.	Won’t be serious political trouble:  only anxiety for Lancs.  Agreemt.

		as a whole is to our advantage.  We have a good case.

	Suggest Maudling speaks, as well as P.T.





	2.	Egypt.



Sim.	Result of Cttee’s consideration.  Plan shd. be ready for Cab. next Wed.



P.M.	Cairo 133., asking leave to discuss availability.

	“Serious incidents” shd. not alter our views on availability.

	Amb. shd. be stiffened.



S.Ll.	“Incidents” have ceased since 21/1.  We are now killing Egyptians.



P.M.	Let Cttee. press on.

	M’while no ques of altering our proposals?



S.Ll.	No.  Tho’ some alternative (omitting reference to U.N.) wd. be more

		favourable to us.



P.M.	Drew attentn. to conversation betwn. Oriental Counsellor Cairo &amp;

		Nasser.  This stresses need for time-table – limit.

				[Exit  A.LB., B.H.

				[Enter  Watk.

	3.	Service Pay.



Al.	3½ yrs. since last review – and c/living has bn. rising, with civil pay.

 	RAB comparisons with ’38 are irrelevant.  Then, married corp. had

		only 45/=.  RAB says w.o. draws £700 :  but he will have had 

		25 yrs’ service &amp; equivalent to senior foreman in industry.

	Slow disintegration of middle-piece &amp; long-term regulars.

	Views of C.O.S.



J.T.	R.N. is losing experienced regulars.  Re-engagement is falling off –

		p.o.’s and stokers.  They are going out because civil earnings

		are higher.

	RAB over-values receipts in kind.  Is it worth 45/= p.wk.

	Semi-skilled dockyd. workers getting v. much more &amp; shorter hours.

	Need a pay code to hold as well as attract regulars.



P.M.	RAF have many amenities and R.N. hasn’t changed.  But Army’s

		special need arises fr. fact tht. 80% serve overseas.  Experienced

		men must not be lost to Army – where there has bn. gt. change in 

		condns./service.



de L.	Rate of internal recruitmt. for technical branches.  Must be able to keep

		people.  At present rate of loss we shall be 40% short of establmt.

		in key groups for m’taining aircraft.  These men have many

		attractive openings in civil life.

	Lowers level of skill in Service.  Also requires us to use short-service

		men, uneconomically, on highly techn. work.

	If you spend a lot of money on RAF it’s wasteful not to pay market

		rate for these few men.



A.H.	P.M.’s remarks support my separate request for “concessions”. 

	£600.000

	On Pay :  2 kinds of men i) remains of 5 and 7 yr. service 74.000

		Source for w.o. in 10 yrs’ time,  Of these 

on re-engagement, last year 24,000 left  :  4,000 stayed

6.500   ..         750 stayed

		These re-engagemt. figures augur ill for men re-engaging at end

		of new 3 year period.

	Army becomg. increasingly techn. – men are more eligible for outside 

		jobs.

	Comparisons with ’38 are unfair – for Army pay was then v. low.

	RAB. condn. re “concessions”.  I cdn’t accept tht. when 80% overseas,

		60% married men are separated, &amp; some 5 battns. consistently

		overseas since end/war.



P.M.	Too many men are marrying young on the strength.  They used to be

		compelled to leave the girl behind.



A.H.	My concessions wdn’t encourage that – only alleviate condns. in 

	Kenya, Egypt etc.,  These condns. are taking people out of Army.



R.A.B.	Met Ministers before Sydney.  Suggd. £2M.  On 29/12 raised my offer

		in lr. wh. hasn’t bn. answered.  Haven’t bn. able to correct my 

		memo. since my return.

	On claim for £21 M. – too much, in reln. to genl. industrial sitn.

		Wd. be unwise to concede so much.

	Moreover, selection isn’t right.  This wd. cover 60% of the whole.

		Must be more selective.

	Let us have another shot at workg. out finer selection inside smaller

		total.

	Comparison with ’38 is rejected.  Then compare with ’46.  Gave

		figures excludg. value in kind.  W.o. :  also privates.  Show an

		increase not more unfavourable than civilians.

	Timing.  Suggest we defer announcemt. until March when Def.

		debate is on, leaving it out of W. Paper. 

	Concessions. Gave £1.5 M. earlier.  Will consider some of these again.

	Officers.  Case is not so urgent.  Wd. prefer to restrict this to o. ranks.



Al.	Wrangling with Ty. for 8 months.  Further examn. will serve only to

		defer decision still longer.

	Total of £8 M. won’t do.  1949 increases (£12 M.) were v. ill-received:

		did more harm than good :  had to be followed in 1950 by a more

		generous settlement.

	Must stop the drain of experienced men.



de L.	They have bn. draining away during the 8 months we have bn. 

		wrangling.



A.H.	Comparison with ’46.  Was admitted then tht. Services were grossly

		under-paid.  What about civilian increases since ’50 since when

		there has bn. no rise in Service pay.



Sal.	As result of 2 wars, we have citizen Army – and pay must be nearer

		to civilian levels.  Ty. line is what ought to satisfy Services.  Fact

		is they aren’t satisfied and are leaving.  That is the actual test.

		Can’t have efficient Services unless we keep these men.

	Same argument applies to concessions.  Useless to compare with

		Police &amp; others who can live normal life in U.K.

	Welcome joint examn.  But shd. be based on need to stop the drain, not

		on what pay ought to be.



Watk.	Why are they leaving?  Is it condns. (civil life) rather than pay?

		In 1950 agreed there shd. be a review to relate Service to civil.

		That was never completed.  Wd. be useful if we cd. complete it.

		To see wtr pay or amenities is main cause.

	W.M. thinks tht. £21 M. increase now wdn’t make it easier to hold

		civil wage awards to average of 7/= p.wk.



A.H.	M/L. always find a reason for judging the moment inconvenient.

	Comparison :  we can’t get agreemt. with Ty. on value of receipts

		in kind.

	Concessions :  have discussed with Ty. for 18 months.  The £1.5 M.

		was given on direct order of P.M. when we failed to agree.



R.A.B.	Drew attention to paras. suggesting need for finer selection.

	Estimates.  Poor response to my appeals for economy.  Def. burden

		is enormous.  Has made it imposs. for us to reduce c/living.

		All our improvemt. in trade has had to go into paying for this.



A.H.	We have offered to carry 50% of this w’in our Estimate total.



P.M.	What is proportionate increase in married men in Army as cpd. with

		before war?



A.H.	Applies only to m. allowances not to nos. on strength, wh. haven’t

		bn. increased.



de L.	False economy to keep pay so low tht. we can’t service equipment

		on wh. we spend so much money.

			Agreed :  50% of total cost be found w’in Def. Budget.



A.H.	Our plan will be recognised as improvemt. for N.C.O.’s &amp; 

		technicians.



H.C.	Officer proposals cost £5½ M.  What of them?  Are they pressed?



Al.	Is it wise to ignore middle-piece officer?  30-40 :  Capt./Major.

		Most valuable officer &amp; the worst off.



A.H.	1950 increase (Socialists) was criticised by us as disproportionately

		ungenerous to officers.  To increase NCO again &amp; leave 

		officers unchanged wd. expose us to criticism.

	We aren’t getting good recruits to S’hurst – largely because Army

		parents can’t afford to support them.



de L.	We can’t fill Cranwell.



P.M.	We must have a target figure.  We must announce in Def. Debate.

	Must break deadlock in offs. discussions.



H.M.	Support the “concessions” – a better remedy than pay for Army.

	Regular engagemt. is now only 3 year.  Can you concentrate

		improvemts on incentive to renew.



A.H.	Bounty schemes are included in our proposals.



Sw.	Can they be linked with it more closely.

	Support “concessions”.



P.M.	Cttee. to report in a week – on incentive concessions totalling £12 M.



A.H.	Our minimum wd. be £18 M.  On basis that below that improvemts.

		wd. be described as derisory.



RAB.	Total £18 M., includg. “concessions”.  And £10½ w’in Service 

		Estimates.               Agreed.



A.H.	Fairer to deal separately with “concessions”.

		I must have it.  Other Services may not want £400,000 for these.



RAB.	Agree in principle to concessions – if A.H. will take 50% in his 

		Estimate  -  Agreed.    Outside the £18 M.



P.M.	Cttee. :  L.P., RAB., M/D. &amp; Service Ministers.

				[Exit  Serv. Ministers.

				[Enter  PMG., H.H.

	4.	Coloured Workers.



P.M.	Problems wh. will arise if many coloured people settle here.  Are we

		to saddle ourselves with colour problems in U.K.

	Attracted by the Welfare State.

	Public opinion in U.K. won’t tolerate it once it gets beyond certain

		limits.



F.H.	Already becoming serious in Manchr.



M.F.	40.000 now cpd. 7.000 pre-war.

	15/6/53 :  3.666 unempld. :  1870 on natl. assistce.

	Living on immoral earngs.  12 mos. to 31/8/53 :  62 convicted MPD

		of whom 24 were coloured.

	All adminve. measures to discourage have bn. taken.  Only further step

		wd. be immigrn. control over admn. of B. subj. to U.K.

		Two methods i) apply A.O. control, incldg. 1(3)(b), to

		Br. subjects.

			Increase of 80 in H.O. &amp; 40 in M/L. staff.

			Double those nos. if extended to Irish Republic.

			With corr. right of deportn.

			              ii) take power to deport B. subj. fr. overseas if

			convicted of serious offence or become public charge.

	Wd. have to admit in Parlt. tht. purpose of legn. was to control admn.

		of coloured.

	There is a case on merits for excludg. riff-raff.  But politically it wd.

		be represented &amp; discussed on basis of a colour limitation.

		That wd. offend the floating vote viz., the old Liberals.

		We shd. be reversing age-long tradn. tht. B. S. have right of

		entry to mother-country of Empire.  We shd. offend Liberals, 

		also sentimentalists.

	On ii) gt. public feeling cd. be aroused by a bad case.  We are in gt.

		danger of that.

	On balance, scale of the problem is such tht. we shdn’t take these 

		risks to-day.

	The col. popns. are resented in Lpl., Paddington &amp; other areas. – by 

		those who come into contact with them.  But those who don’t

		are apt to take Liberal view.



L.P.	This is increasing evil.  Principle laid down 200 yrs. ago are not

		applicable to-day.

	See dangers of colour discriminn.  But other Doms. control entry of

		B. subjects.  Cd. we present action as coming into line with 

		them &amp; securing uniformity.



P.M.	Ques. is wtr it is politically wise to allow public feeling to

                    x|		develop a little more – before takg. action.



Sw.	Restn. on entry in 4 old Doms. &amp; Ceylon.  None in India or Pak.

		They might retaliate by restns. on B. subj. entry.

	Power to deport B. subjects is universal in Doms.  There wd. be

		no bad re-action v. legn. here takg. similar power.

	I wd. support second, tho’ not first.



H.H.	Right of entry is restricted in most Colonies.  And most have power

		to deport.

	Legn. based on colour wd. be disastrous in Colonies.

	Genl. restn. of entry wd. be resented in many Comm. countries.

	No objn. likely to be taken against power to deport.



P.M.	May be wise to wait as at x/.  But it wd. be fatal to let it develop

		too far.



H.M.	Study first the ques of deportn.



P.M.	Wd. like also to study possibility of “quota” – no. not to be exceeded.



Sw.	Will submit memo. on depn. powers in Doms.

		C.O. shd. do same for Colonies.

					[Exit  PMG.



	5.	Overseas Information Services.



R.A.B.	Solution -    i)  all D. economies to come in at once.  £171.000.

			 ii)  contn to rising costs £150.000.

			iii)  40,000  F.O.      }  new money.

			       35,000  C.O.     }         ..

			         7,000  C.R.O. }          ..

	Cd. Ty. examine this in consultn. with all overseas Dpts. and B/T.



S.Ll.	Will consider – doesn’t meet A.E.’s view.



R.A.B.	Can’t give C.o.I. any more.



S.Ll.	It includes Arab newspaper.



P.M.	Our expenditure was never more &amp; our relns. never worse.





	6.	Industrial Disputes.



Watk.	El. dispute will continue.
