C.C. 106(52)							18th December, 1952



		1.	Parliament.			[Enter B.H., 3 Serv Ministers

							 D. Eccles.

H.C.	Business for week after Recess.

	Asked for more time for Report Stage of Transp. Bill.  Ready to offer one more day.

	Will announce to-day.

	Steel : likely to get vol. agreement covering same time as we wd have imposed by time-table.  Hope to announce Friday, if Oppn. gives final agreemt. to-night.





		2.	Palace of Westminster.



	Oppn. are pressing for Sel. Cttee. on managemt. of Palace of W’minster, incldg. staff etc.,  Wd. have to be Joint Sel. Cttee. wh. Oppn. don’t like.



D.E.	Old diffy. – Ld. Gt. Chamberlain &amp; M/W. frontier demarcation.  R.R.S. had trouble &amp; is pursuing vendetta.



	Two points 	i)  who controls W’minster Hall.  Clear enough it’s 

	in which 	M/W.	

	Members are

	interested.      ii) remainder : L.Gt. Ch. is responsible but that does

			not accord with modern requiremts.  He is less 			amenable than other Ministers.  Yet we pay.  Point is 		tht. we in H/C. might get more of available room if 			M/W. were in sole control.



Sal.	It is a Royal Palace.  Gt. pity to alter basis of arrangemt. &amp; bring it wholly under Govt. control.



Sw.	Little waste of space in H/L.



H.C.	Flats inhabited eg. by lady caterer to H/L.

	Staff : cases of nepotism eg. in Library &amp; Serjeant/Arms.

           x/	Prs. stave it off by saying we are considering this but clear it and leave to be Joint Cttee of both Houses.



P.M.	Let us agree to x/.

							[Exit D.E.



		3.	Duke of Edinburgh Military Rank.



Sim.	Read his recommendns..  No legal, constitutional or other reasons why Queen’s wish, to make him F.M., Adm. of Fleet and Marshal of R.A.F., shd. not take effect early in Jan.

P.M.	I will submit Cab.’s decision : to-day.

							[Exit B.H.



		4.	Coronation : Amnesties.



		a)	For Deserters.



P.M.	I favour this.



A.H.	Put the case against doing it.



Sal.	How long is this to be contd.?  No amnesty ever?



A.H.	This moment anyway wd. be bad because of Korea.



P.M.	Associatn. with Coronation : I wd. seek the Queen’s views.  Mercy has often bn. assocd. with national rejoicings.



		b)	For Civil Prisoners.



M.F.	Objns. are v. strong.  Many injustices wd. be involved.  Cdn’t do it for Borstal (training).  Many real thugs cd not be enlarged.          Agreed.



		a)	Deserters (resumed).



A.H.	No other country with N.S. has done this.  All 3 Serv. Min + M/D. advise v. it.



	I believe it wd. increase incidence of desertion – damage Service discipline for sake of v. small no.



J.S.	Unfair to those who surrendered and were punished under Labour Govt. offer – also to those who fought all through.



A.H.	Nos. now at large are estimated at only 2.000. And v. little crime among them.



Sim.	28.000 charged : 260 deserters – in 1951 in M.P.D.



W.M.	Await M/D. views.  M.F. In favour.  R.A.B. In favour.  Sal. In favour.

	Bad hats won’t be effected : many who have made good shd. be given a chance.

	Not always an unpardonable crime.  H.M. In favour.  Balance has changed.

	Next time it won’t be safer in U.K. than in front line.  SW) L) In favour if assocd. with Coronn.



P.M.	(Balance in favour – doing it in Coronation year.)

	(Draw up memo. showg. how it wd. be done &amp; announced.



J.S.	Test opinion in H/C. before we act.

							[Enter T.D.



		5.	Common Land.



T.D.	H.A. Cttee. agreed – so many complexities &amp; interests tht. R.C. is best method.

	Ld. Chanc. agrees.



P.M.	Don’t ignore rights of ramblers – free access to countryside etc.,



Sal.	Yes : that’s why we don’t concede to agriculture all it wants : safeguarded by t. of r.  Want a member who can spk. of rare birds, plants etc.,



H.C.         x/	“wthr” vice “how” in t. of ref.  (Measure of agreement with this.)



H.M.	Mght sometimes be better to use it for housing than to poach on good agric. land.



P.M.	Why hurry?  Use marginal land first.  Tories won’t get much credit out of it.



R.A.B.	Support because of need for increased agric. prodn.



Ch.	Only 1% of common land was brght under cultivation during the war.



P.M.	Wd. provoke cry for nationalisation.



		Agreed – defer.



		6.	Iceland Fishery Dispute.		      [Exit A.H. de L.

								      [Enter Heald, Nutting, 									     H.G. Mackeson

P.M.	V. complex.  Swindle by Iceland Govt.

	If it goes to Court &amp; we lose, others will follow suit – to our gt. disadvantage.

	But case mght drag on for a year : during that time Iceland wd. not do v. well and we mght force concession fr. them.  V. diff. for us to dragoon our trade interests m’while.



L.	We shdn’t get favourable decn. fr. Court unless they went back on Norway decision.



Nutt.	Norwegian base-lines were drawn on much narrower basis than Iceland.



Sal.	We shd. not abandon our trade interests.  Tell Iceland we can’t interfere with free decn. of our traders.  Risk retaliation v. our exports.



Sw.	Agree.  Court is a bad bet.  Greenland etc., will be more influenced by seeing tht I. has tried it &amp; failed, as result, to sell fish here.  Favour 11(b).



Sal.	Don’t go as far as 11(b).  Make no declaration.  Merely say it’s for our traders.



Sim.	Shall have to go to Ct. some day.  And they are not likely to go so far as support of Iceland interpretn.



P.M.	Trouble if we go short of fish.  Awkward to go to court then.



Sal.	No : by then general public interest wd. have bn. damaged – a cause for Govt. intervention.



Ch.	Court won’t go back on judgemt. but mght say Iceland line isn’t reasonable.



Att.G.	They might like chance to say “we didn’t mean that”.

	No need to try to stop our trade retaliation while we are arguing before Ct.

	We cd. say we can’t control our trade.  And Icel. Govt. won’t relax their restns. m’while.



P.M.	Then go to Court : but do nothg. m’while to press our trade to lift the ban.



Mack.	Exports : signs of retaliation, but trade is small.



H.G.	In Jan/Mar. we are dependent for 10% of fish on Iceland.



R.A.B.	Will B/T. consider o.g.l. on fish &amp; abolition of q.v. for fish.  To keep in reserve in case this appln. fails.



Nutt.	Can we ask, tho’ not press, trawler owners to lift ban m’while.  Agreed.





		7.	G.P.O. Employment of Coloured Workers.	[Enter P.M.G.

								 [Exit J.T. H.G. Mack, 									Att.G. Nutting

P.M.	Don’t want a parti-coloured U.K. – or P.O.



P.M.G.	Not a P.O. ques.  I haven’t added any, on balance.  Taken on at request of M/L.  If you don’t want them here, Govt. shd. keep them out.  I can’t be only Dpt. to apply a colour bar.  Other Dpts. employ some, incldg. R.A.F.



M.F.	Col. aliens can be excluded.  Coloured B. subjects can be required to establish nationality.  Has, however, for years bn. policy that B. subj. has right to enter U.K.  Tho’ it has always bn. recognised tht. a point mght come when because of colour problems we shd. have to impose some control.  There are some isolated diffies. in certain towns.

	About 3.000 p.a. enter.



	Shd. we have fact-finding Cttee of officials to look into this problem – getting informn. fr. local people incldg Police.  Private enquiry.



O.L.	Support enquiry – C.O. shd. be included.

							         [Exit P.M.G.



		8.	William Hughes : Commemoration in St. Pauls.



Sal.	Denman suggd. this.  Menzies, whom I asked, supported it.

	No precedent because of his Imperial record.



P.M.	10 year rule for H/C.  We broke it for Smuts.  But Hughes isn’t comparable with him.



Sal.	It wd. not be a Govt. initiative.  Tho’ Govt. blessing wd. be desired.



P.M.	Say Govt. have high regard for H. but this is for private initiative &amp; discretn. of Dean &amp; Chapter.





		9.	Report of Employment Committee.



Sw.	Let this Cttee lapse.  Let E.P.C. keep under review.  Ad hoc Cttees. as required.



R.A.B.	Thanks to D.S. for prompt action avertg. unemplt. in S. Wales.
