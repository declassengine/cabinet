C.C. 12 (54)					26th February, 1954



				                     [Enter PMG. Gammans, B.H., Solr. Genl.

185.	    Television.



Bill.



P.M.G.	Modified plan more likely to meet public opinion.



	Clause 1.



M.F.	Independent T.V. Authority vice competition. 



				Agreed.



Sal.	Don’t qualify “quality” in 1(1).



				  ..    ..



M.F.	Minor points re N. Ireland.  Will settle among officials.



	Clause 2.



PMG.	Cl. 2 (2) (a).  Some cos. may like it.



O.L.	Omit “comprehensiveness”.



			Agreed.



Sw.	Omit also power to direct them to take particular items.



	Clause 3.



P.T.	Wd. like Bill’s method, but doubt if we shd. get away with it.  Film trade wd. press hard for closer control on quota method.



Sw.	V. complicated.  This t.v. thing is v. embryonic – trade not yet formed.  Can’t hope to get a quota system right at this early stage.  This was view of Cttee. after careful thght.



P.M.G.	I agree.  Troubled only by pledges given re B. character of p’mme.



A.E.	F.O. wd. prefer quota system – in a separate Bill.



Sw.	Start with 3(1)(d).  Promise separate quota legn. if too much pressure.



A.E.	Amend Cl. 3(1)(a) to read “tone &amp; style of p’mmes are predominately British”.

			             ..  ..   ..  “nothg. offends v. good taste or decency”.

	Retain (d) and wait for pressure as above.

	Cl. 3 (1) (b) delete comprehensiveness.



	Clause 5.

	

M.F.	Want to limit it to persons resident in U.K.  But we treat Irish as non-foreigners:  higher than m.f.n.  Add them.



Sw.	And delete “ordinarily”. – to let in Australians etc.,



A.E.	F.O. don’t like (i) at all.  Wd. sooner rely on amended 3(1)(a).

		They cd. still operate thro’ agencies.  Wdn’t. be effective.



H.C.	H/C. will be hot on this because Americans.



Sol. Genl.	U.S. cos. cd. easily get round this regln.



			Agreed :  Limit this to cos. regd. in U.K. or persons 	ordinarily resident.



	Penalties Cl. 5 (4) (b).



Solr. G.	Many duties put on Authy.  They must have sanction other than 5(5)

		They ought to be something less than terminatg. contract.  Hence I proposed money penalties.  Cl.5(5) wd. be rarely used because fear of loss of revenue.



O.L.	I support this.  Fine is lesser penalty.  I wd. say after 3 fines Cl.5(5) comes into operation.	        }   

				        }  Agreed

Sim.	Make it clear tht. there will be no fines w’out arbitn.     }

		if possible on face of Bill.



	Clause 7. &amp; 12.



RAB.	Will send in small amendmt on financial matters.



	Licence Fees.



R.A.B.	Make it guineas?



P.M.G.	Wd. be said tht. the 3/- repd. cost of competitive service.

	We can manage at £3.  B.B.C. will take it, grudgingly.

	We have some elbow-room because low estimate of increase in numbers.



P.T.	Raise the sums before the Bill comes in.



P.M.G.	Not much time.  Can announce on Tuesday.  Bill a few days later.

	Revenue increase for B.B.C. will be 50%.

			Announce Tuesday.

			Introduce Bill on Friday.

			                                                  [Exit PMG. Gamm. S.Glr.



1.	    Town &amp; Country Planning.

187)	

Noted with approval.

			[Enter Hill



1.	    Fatstock Guarantees.

188)	

C. Hill	F.A.O. conclusion of Tuesday: assumed a further opportunity to review.

	But if we don’t decide final form of cards now, we can’t be sure of being ready to open new scheme (&amp; end rationing) in July.

	Staff of 800 and much expenditure needed already on this Scheme.

		More if it becomes more complicated.



T.D.	Agree on merits tht. fat cows shd. be excluded.  But can’t do it w’out time to bring farmers round.  There will be gt. trouble. No money in it.

	Leaving them in now doesn’t mean that they will be in for ever.

		In a year or two, we cd. get them out.

	V. strong feeling among farmers e.g. in N. West.  Fat cows have bn. covered ever since 1940.



R.A.B.	Purely political.  Excites much fury among M.P.’s.  Right on merits to exclude.  Wiser course is to include – but screw price right down to guaranteed price.



C.H.	May be a lot of money in this if prices of this meat falls.

				                 [Exit Hill.



			                                                        [Enter 3 Serv. Min. O.P.

1.	    Officers Retired Pay.

189)	

P.M.	We can mention this on Tuesday, in connn. with Service pay.

	Then Judges Bill can go forward also.



R.A.B.	Shd. we also publish W. Paper?



			Approved.



O.P.	Had hoped to m’tain pensions front unbroken until Phillips had reported.  I have staty. duty to review N.H. rates this year :  &amp; can’t do it until end/year.  Heavy pressure fr. B. Legion &amp; o.a.p.

	Hoped therefore tht. if this were done, suppl. allowances for worst war injured cd. be increased.  Will submit proposals to that end to Cabinet.

		Don’t want award to be simultaneous.



			Thursday.  M.P.’s Salaries – O.P.’s memo.
