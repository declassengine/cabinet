C.C. 27(53).				16th April, 1953.



	1.	Budget : Scilly Islands.	[Enter  B-H., S.Ll.



P.M.	Pretty sudden.



R.A.B.	Did not mention to Cabinet because thought unimportant.  Taken

		by surprise.

	1.600 inhabitants : £100.000 p.a. revenue : from 1954/5.

	All other islands save Lundy are subject to tax.  (12 inhabitants)

	Flourishg. industry – flowers, tourism.

	Cornish M.P.’s think this will be thought just in Cornwall.

	Case is un-answerable in logic.  Tho’ admit it has deep historic

		Roots : they were not pre-Pitt assessed to land-tax.



P.M.	Shd. they not have lead 2 or 3 yrs’ notice.  Revolution in daily life of

		every family – and whole economy of island.

	Cd. not decn. stand, but period of notice given – or even be brought

		in gradually.



R.A.B.	Bill does provide for one year’s notice.  Assessed in 1954/5 on income

		for [1953/4] that year.

			R.A.B. to consider &amp; report.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Opposition wish to debate on Monday orders imposing control of

		trade to China.



S.Ll.	Awkward now because truce discussions.  But must be done 

		before 4/5.



B.H.	Will be F.A. debate in following week.  H.C. Mght. put them off on

	that basis.  WD. be in better context after that debate.



H.C.	Transport : H/L. Amendmts.  Opposn. can’t come to terms.  H/C. may

		sit v. late.  Shall start on Tuesd. &amp; resume Thurs. – if necessary

		sitting into Friday.

			Agreed:  Must complete H/L. Amendmts. this week.



				[Exit  B.H.

				[Enter  McL., D.S., D.E.



	3.	Housing Policy:  Rents.



H.C.	i)	Are we going on with this?

	ii)	Can we legislate this session?  Separate Sc. Bill will be needed :		and J.S. can’t agree to E. &amp; W. going far ahead of Scotland.



H.M.	Two aspects of housing – bldg. of new : repair or demolition of old.

		We have broken back of first.  In 1st qtr. of 53, 70.000 as cpd.

		53.000.  Mar. 28.000 is highest monthly total since war.  We may

		therefore get the 300.000 target this year, tho’ I shan’t say so

		publicly.  Don’t want to go higher in ‘54/55 : indeed, I wd. accept

		a fall, when we are divertg. public attn. to problem of old houses.

	7¼ m. landlord-owned houses are the problem.  2¼ m. are 100 &amp; more

		years’ old:  &amp; 4¾ m. are more than 60 yrs. old.  But we need

		them all.

		mjr. Problems  i) conversion  ii) improvemts. to modern 

		standards iii) ordinary repairs iv) patching up condemned

		houses to last a bit longer.  i), ii) and iv) need special Govt. help.  

		Bill applies only to iii). 

	Rent increase must be presented as part of a single operation &amp; design.

	Circulated &amp; explained table of increases.

	L’lord must declare house to be in g. &amp; tenantable repair.  Tenant has

		appeal.

	Not a flat-rate increase.  Wd. not happen all at once – as &amp; when notice 

		served and repairs done.  Increased rent wd. be associated with

		repairs remembered.

	Sc. Plan : 40% increase because no other scheme is practicable under

		their system.  But less variation in existg. rents.

	Not out of scale with increases wh. (non-profit making) l.a.’s have had 

		to make.

	If we agree this in principle, LPS &amp; B-H cd. consult with me on 

		legve. time-table.



D.E.	Must be presented as part of the grand design.

	Haven’t bn. able to consider what total load of that wd. be on the

		bldg. industry.  Wd. like a little more time to consider that.



R.A.B.	Favour H.M.’s plan.  Support it wholly.  Wd. like to consider max. of

		twice s.d.  Must tackle this soon.  Even our critics cd. be made 

		to recognise tht. this is courageous solution of v. diff. problem.

		Conservative Govt. shd. conserve old houses.

	V. great help to stability of £.  Regarded as touchstone.

		Can’t tackle housg. subsidy until we have done this.

		Weakness of Budget speech was my inability to show real plan

		to reduce expre.  Thus, for me, sooner the better.



Sal.	Endorse R.A.B.’s remarks.  An increasing scandal.  We shall gain in 

		credit for tackling it.



W.	Endorse this last point.  And fr. that angle, sooner the better.

Sw.	Must go fwd., not merely be presented, as a single whole.  Cd. legn.

		cover all aspects.



P.M.	Approve plan in principle

	White Paper covering all the ground.

	P’mme of action:  L.P.S., B-H. &amp; Housing

			           Ministers to prepare.

			Same Cttee. &amp; Ch. Whip.

				[Exit  I.McL., D.E.





	4.	Atomic Energy Organisation.



Ch.	Tell Opposn. (lr. to C.R.A.) : then make announcement.



D.S.	Tell Opposn. at once.  Better to speak to H.M.  Then make early

		announcemt.

	On Report : para. 3(f).  We mustn’t prejudge now wtr. these 

		establmts. shd. be transferred.



S.Ll.	Enquiries outside U.K.



Ch.	No.  Certainly not w’out consultn. with F.O.



R.A.B.	Don’t announce principle has bn. accepted.



Ch.	We did agree on principle.



			Adjourn until Tuesday.
