C.C. 73(53).			                                                             30th November, 1953.



	1.	Kenya.                                                    [Enter  A.H., Att.G., B-H.



P.M.	A.H. as well as O.L. wd. have to spk. in debate.



A.H.	First consn. :  is this (murder) exceptional or a matter of course?  We

		shd. seek to show it was exceptional.  Erskine issued strong 

		directive, as soon as he arrived, deprecating competitive 

		killing.  After this incident, but before he knew of it.

	Never any official reward.  Not much unofficial, either.

	Brigadier at time has assured me tht. he wd. never have tolerated

		money awards.



B-H.	A statement in reply to P.Q. tht. this directive was issued mght induce

		spkr. to refuse adjournment.



P.M.	Conduct unbecoming an officer &amp; gentleman cd. be a charge v. G.,

		even tho’ he has bn. acquitted of murder.



A.H.	He has made some v. discreditable statements.



Att.G.        	x|  Legally, he cd. be tried by civil court for murder, despite ct. m. 

	finding. (S. 162 of Army Act.



P.M.	We shd. make it clear tht. we regard this as grave ques &amp; intend to

		pursue it.



Att.G.	No record of acting as above x|.



P.M.	On facts as we know them, certain possibilities are open e.g. x|.  That

		Wd. make it still sub iudice.

	Apart fr. issue of murder, consn. of good behaviour.  Erskine’s

		directive.  We won’t tolerate this sort of thing, however violent

		attacks to wh. our men are exposed.

	Possibly Commn. of Enquiry :  Privy Councillors, two fr. each side?

		Our name must be cleared.



B-H.	Firm promise of Enquiry wd. scotch any ques. of adjournment being

		granted.



O.L.	Deprecate civil commn. of enquiry into mil. behaviour.

	Wd. prefer Co. of Enquiry (military).

	On condns. generally in K., a Parly. Commn. is going out after Xmas.



A.H.	Point out tht. incident occurred June.  Erskine’s directive (July)

		shows he won’t tolerate this kind of thing.



A.H.	May procdgs of ct. martial be laid before Parlt., if that is pressed?



M.F.	See no objn. to that.



M.F.	We may be pressed to satisfy ourselves tht. this is not a genl. condn.

		of affairs.  Shd. Army Council appoint Court of Enquiry to go

		into that.



A.H.	Reflects on Erskine, who has said he won’t have it.



		AH., M-F., W.M. &amp; Att.G. w’drew to draft Statement.



	Later :  Statement approved, with amendment.





	2.	Sudan.



A.E.	43 out of 90 declared.  7 to come in, of which 5 will prob. go to them.

		Thus 48 out of 90.  They shd. be able to form a Govt.

	Religion became basis of election – UMMA lost out on that.  Also

		in the towns.  Mahdi’s nephew, even, was beaten in Omdurman.

	The South has stood firm.

	No agreemt. betw. UMMA &amp; Party most favourable to us.

		Therefore split vote wh. let N.U.P. in.

	Elections did not result from Anglo-E. Agreement.

	Hard to say what relns. of new Govt. will be with E.  Unlikely tht.

		they wd. have majority in favour of union with E.  Probable tht.

		Said Ali will try gradually to shake off the E. connection.

	Once N. had reached his agreement with E. Parties, we had no

		alternative but to go fwd. with creation of S. Parlt. 

		Any other course wd. have united all S. Parties against us.



P.M.	Can you make a case proving corruptn. by E?



A.E.	No.  For many constituencies won w’out it.

	Our adminn. have under-estimated religious objns. to Mahdi &amp; assumed

		he wd. have more influence than he has.

		The 2 leaders are both religious – diff. sects.



P.M.	Bearing on defence agreement.



A.E.	Those Tories who oppose it will now do so more vigorously – 

		&amp; attract some more support.

	Robertson thinks this will make N. more ready to conclude agreemt.

	U.S. attitude throughout this area is disquieting.  Persia : Hoover is

		back here &amp; wants to go to P. &amp; start negotiating at once.  He

		alleges tht. our July telegrams implied tht. A.I.O.C. wd. drop

		out of future arrangemts. so long as compensn. is paid.  Looks

		as tho’ U.S. wd. gladly jockey us out of any share in P. oil.







	3.	Middle East Defence Policy.



P.M.	Read draft of a Minute to M/D. on re-deployment in M/E.



A.E.	Is Cyprus better than Smyrna.  It is accepted.  It is British.

		Do we risk future by going to Smyrna.



Al.	I will have this examined technically.





	4.	Uganda.



O.L.	Message received – Kabaka has bn. deposed &amp; is on his way to 

		Ldn by air.

	Shd. I make a statement in H/C. to-day?



P.M.	Yes :  safety in numbers.  Confuse it by bringing out all the horrors.



B.H.	The wd. get adjournment on that.



A.E.	But mistake to w’hold it if news is on tape.



			Agreed :  make Statement to-day.		[Exit  A.E.
