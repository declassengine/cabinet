C.C. 40 (53)					8th July, 1953



60.	    Opening of Parliament.

					[Enter S.Ll., B.H.

L.P.S.	Tilney represents no-one.  Bright idea of his own.





1.	    Regency.

			

Sal.	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



            |	Legn was conceived long before Towns. story &amp; for quite other

	|			reasons.

        x  |		Weak to defer to Press agitn.  And same trouble will be aroused again later, in autumn: shall have the trouble twice.

	Br. people wd. on whole welcome D.E. as Regent, irrespective of stories about Princess M.



M-F.	



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





R.A.B.	Not a ques. of “giving way”:  choice of best time.



W.M.	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



J.S.	Timing : moment of Queen’s departure – troubles less likely to be raised.



B-H.	WD. be more diff. to get it thro’ before Recess if there were controversy.



Sw.	Shd. have to hold further consultn. with Opposn. Leaders now.

	Timing:  we consider only Queen’s interest – to avoid embarrassment.

	Possible that B’brook will pursue the ques. &amp; raise irresponsibly trouble over constitutional ques.



		R.A.B.    Report to P.M.

		               Consult C.R.A. &amp; Cl.D. again.  6.30 p.m.

				      M-F. to discuss with Queen during visit to Wales, 

				being told the P.M.’s view beforehand.



Sal.	I may be wrong : but you won’t escape diffies. by p’ponment.

Better therefore to get the trouble now.





1.	    Korea.





1.	    E/West Trade.

64)	

65)	

1.	    Egypt:  Defence Negotiations.



Sal.	New formula – adding “in event of a major war.”



O.L.	Does phrase “contractg. parties” exclude possibility tht. E. might claim exclusive use of base if aggression were v. them.  ? Insert “both.”



			Agreed:  insert “both”



Sal.	Stand pat on this formula, with U.S. – even if we have to make concessions to E. later.





1.	    Policy towards Germany.



Sal.	French (thro’ Amb.) favour 4 Power Talks &amp; co-opn. in def. of West.

But added : Fr. can’t now accept E.D.C. in view of new chance of united Germany.  Amb. said he wd. prefer indep. G. Army in N.A.T.O.

	Told him he must expect us to press E.D.C. in W’ton.

	Looks as tho’ Fr. won’t accept any date for ratifn.





1.	    Libya.

			                                   [Enter AH., de l., V.CIGS., CAS.

S.H.	Conversations with Libyan P.M.

	We wanted B. protectorate, not indep. country : &amp; we always therefore wanted it w’in our orbit – econ. assistc. &amp; troops.

	Provisional aggreemt. made early in ’53.  Current interim agreemts. for £11/2M. p.a. &amp; troops as now.  They expire at end/July.  If nothg. more, we shall have no right to stay &amp; Arab League will take us to U.N.

	Lib. P.M. is pledged not to bring up further interim agreemt.  Must therefore get a permanent one.  Can get one, if we make some concessions, covering 2 airfields and accommn. outside main cities.  £21/2M. p.a. WD. give us 20 yrs. foothold.  Gt. advantage.  Right to put there troops displaced Fr. E.  Wd. be precedent for Sudan.

	But awkward for w.o. - who, after 5 yrs., will not have enough accommn.



A.H.	C.O.S. strategic minimum is “Armoured Brigade.  Libyan offer wd. mean much expre on new barracks etc. (e.g. £20M.) for all our installns. are in the towns.  Cdn’t do more than 1M. p.a. : wd. take us v. long time.

And after 5 yrs. shd. have to evacuate many of troops now there.

	We cd. keep smaller garrison – either now or after 5 yrs.

Perm. bldgs. wd. be expensive on 20 yr. run.



de L.	Immedte. : facilities to re-deploy 2/3 squadrons fr. E.

	Long-term : base at El Adam &amp; staging use of El. Idris.

We cd. probably do a deal with them.  V. important to have transport transit facilities.



R.A.B.	Awkward to settle this independently of M/E. strategy as a whole.

	Mustn’t authorise plans so large that they commit us.

	Need to get f’hold w’out prejudicing future.



Al.      |	Must have Treaty.  Get as much accommn as we can.  Then allow

        x |		accommn available to determine size of garrison.  Bring 

	|		remainder home.

           |

R.A.B.|	And discuss with Ty. amount of annual expre on works e.g. £1m.



1)	Agreed:  as at x/.

2)	M/D. to give forecast to Cab. of M/E. deploymt. in future. (after Rad. Review)

3)	Amount of financial subsidy to be settled with Ty – when we know what bargains we have got with Libyan P.M.
