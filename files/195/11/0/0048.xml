H.C.	Conversations have bn. procedg.  Y’day received specific proposals from Opposn. and from All-Party Members Cttee.

	Draft Motions considered.



R.A.B.	Shd. we mention Members’ Fund?  I shd. have no objn.  *Favour adding it.



B.H.	Opposn. don’t mention it in their draft.  And it is separate matter.



R.A.B.	Let Ch. Whip negotiate draft A. with Opposn. : &amp; we will put it to 1922 Cttee.



H.C.	Suggd. tht. Motion be tabled by back-benchers of both Parties and carried w’out discussion. Gt. relief to have avoided debate.



			Agreed : Fact-finding enquiry : no recommns.





1.	    Television.



R.A.B.	Seeing 1922 Cttee this p.m.  with L.P.S. &amp; P.M.G.

	On publicity – they want to stress Govt. belief in competition principle.

We have said so in W. Paper.  Have not publicly resiled fr. it.

Final decision p’poned until autumn.  Must say now it all depends how p. opinion goes. how good the case for it is and how well it is put across.  Otherwise we shall be told we are guilty of bad faith in autumn.

	Memo. from P.M.G. on alternative types of competn. – at Cab. later.

	Publicity.  Supporters of commercial television can do all they wish.

But Central Office only on basis of publd. Govt. Statements viz., W. Paper, L.P.S. statement at H/L. debate.  They will need supervision.



W.	I will provide that.  Agree we shd. stick by what Govt. has said h’to.



R.A.B.	Sw. can also help – with press &amp; Liaison Cttee.



Sw.	May we add some objective &amp; factual material?



R.A.B.	Yes.

70)	5.    Post Office Staff Association.



W.M.	Met 1922 Cttee. on Tues. – Exec. Cttee. &amp; Labour Cttee.  Our approach was less violently opposed than 12 mos. ago.  On merits, they were satisfied with our explanations. But on pledges, they are uncomfortable.  D. Walker Smith is considering wtr. we need to go 1922 Cttee itself.



PMG.	No case for recognition : &amp; I can’t run G.P.O. if I’m required to quarrel with the staff.  Believe I have satisfied our supporters on the merits.



R.A.B.	Diffy. is what we said in Opposition – on this Union, too.



W.M.	We were wrong then : &amp; I am prepared to say so.



B.H.	Think you will have to meet 1922 Cttee. as a whole.

Especially as this will be matter not coming to a Divn.

Suggest you see them next week.



W.	Arising also on an Air Miny. Union.

					[Exit P.M.G.

					[Enter T.D., G.Ll.

70)	6.    Coal.



L.	V. disappointg.  Loss on Coronation v 2nd weeks’ holiday is no greater than estimated.  But absentee-ism is increasing.  And larger %age of small coal in prodn. because of mechanisation : &amp; outlet for this is difficult. But method of disposal is pinking with large coal in exports.

	Export markets are good.  Don’t want to distribute them.  Particularly don’t want to break contracts.  Prefer therefore to buy some large coal from Europe.



N.B.	Read Minute giving P.M.’s view. 



L.	Increased industrial consumption of coal is part reason.



W.M.	Textiles demand will go even higher.  Sure our industrial stocks are sufficient?



L.	Yes, I hope so.



Ch.	Inevitable.  Can be represented as exchange of one type of coal for another.

	Serious aspect is outlook for next year &amp; beyond.  Demand will out-run supply if we export as much as now.  More men &amp; less coal : &amp; mechanisation is not evidently the answer – if it gives you only more coal you can’t sell.



L.	Can’t go back on mechanisation.



S.Ll.    *	From Schuman countries, not Poland – for political reasons.



Ch.	Gt. national extravagance in use of coal – domestic gratis.



P.T.	This is problem of large coal.  That is w’in our choice. Mechann. gives us small.  N.C.B. concerned with total not quality.  They shd. dig the right sort.

	Extravagance.  Rlways use 17m tons of large coal – more than any country in world.



L.	No other country uses only large coal on rlways.  But our locos. are so constructed tht. they won’t work on small.  In long-term rlways will have to change over.



W.	Are rlways designing new locos to burn small coal?



L.	They will go to oil, I expect.



R.A.B.	1)	Authorise the import proposed.

		Presentatn. : link it with Schuman Authy, who have spoken of 

			exchange of types of coal.

		Leave a little over for prod. to miners.



L.	No statement until we have bought.



Sw.	Will leak when first contract is placed.

	

Ll.G.	Leakage will come 3 days after 1st. approach.



R.A.B.	2)	L. to submit further memo. on coal policy.

Investment here is less in propn. to output than in Europe.

	I’m ready to authorise more.

		We shd. do more in importing mining engineers.

Want a more active policy, not excldg. increased efficiency of N.C.B. 

Otherwise, we shall have v. serious trouble in 1954/55.



L.	Accept that open-cast is not a permanent feature in our coal production.





T.D.	Must preserve out best agricultural land. – esp. because immediate coal crises.



J.S.	Wd. have wished to abandon open-cast before this Parlt. ends.



R.A.B.   	Let L. include this in further report.



H.C.	Also rlways.



G.Ll.     	Also qualitative element – large &amp; small coal both prodn. &amp; consumpn. aspect.



Sw.	Be ready with announcemt. in case of leak.  And see Lobby at once.



R.A.B.	Keep Sw. &amp; others informed.



L.	Want authority to buy up to 1m.  Tho’ shall prob. not buy more than 1/2m. at outset.



RAB.    	Long-term memo. before end/July.

	Mght. use this as prod. to N.J.A.C.I. – 22/7.





70)	7.    Tariff Policy.

71)	

P.T.	Held up on horticultural tariffs.  Can hold gardeners &amp; back-benchers until end/year, but no more.

	Doms. supported us in attempt to get relaxn. of G.A.T.T.  But will be diff. to get it w’out U.S. support.  Suggd. we offered to them 3 concessions

		i) bound items

		ii) right to retaliate.

		iii) exclude Ottawa list goods.

	E.P.C. authd. i) and ii) but said not iii) w’out Cab. authority.

	R.M. evidently thinks he won’t get U.S. support unless he throws in iii).

		Recommend he be authorised to use it.  W D., with M/S., give him guidance on our political diffes.



R.A.B.	It will upset Doms &amp; mayn’t carry U.S.



Sw.     	If we fail to carry U.S., all bets will be off:  &amp; we needn’t go on with

	  x |	iii)?		 



P.T.	We shd. be unable to raise tariffs under iii) unless we got specific waiver in G.A.T.T.  Wd. not therefore hurt Doms. – who wd. stand as now, unless a specific waiver secured.



O.L.	Colonies affected only qua honey.



Ch.	Need we do this – just because gardiners prefer tariffs to quotas.  Cdn’t we hold out for another year?



R.A.B.    	Is x/ correct?



Sw.	If U.S. won’t support us, our hands are free to argue as we like in G.A.T.T.



P.T.	No.   For I wd. have to use (iii) in G.A.T.T. – vis-à-vis Dutch.

Tho’ I wdn’t be committed to it.



			Agreed.  R.M. be authorised to use (iii).
