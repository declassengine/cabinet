C.C. 33 (53)					21st May, 1953



24.	    Kenya.						[Enter S.Ll.

					

O.L.	Improved:  because no spread to other tribes : no significant spread.

Confessions : flow is now a flood.  e.g. 1000 in one day in one place.

Demarcn. btwn. M.M. &amp; rest of Kikuyu is much more marked.

		Intelligence v. full.

		Home Grds. bldg. up.

	On other side, gangs are larger (e.g. 100 strong &amp; 20 weapons).  Attacks on pol. posts (20 Afr. with 2 Eur.)  Advantage so long as can be engaged by mil. or regular police.  But Home Grd. posts are easier for them to over-run – and that is danger.

	Confidence in Govt. is being re-gained.  Atmosphere is much better.

	On present trend might. clear whole thing up by 1/8.

	Need more punch and a few more troops to bring it off.

	Gt. congestn. in courts – criminal cases.  Introducg. “emergency assizes” to avoid settlers’ cry for “summary justice”.  6 extra Judges :  no ct of 1st instance : appeals in Chambers vice Court.

	Opposn. case that repressive measures are driving loyal K. to M.M. – proved to be opposite of truth.



P.M.	No “mass executions”.



O.L.	Tried individually.  But will come to Cab. before more than 12 are executed at one time.





1.	    Foreign Affairs:  Tripartite Meeting.



P.M.	Eisenhower telephoned last night.  Said Mayer wants to make urgent statement this p.m.  Said he (E) proposed 3-Power mtg. at top level:  in Maine, he thought.  Suggd 8/6.  P.M.M. prevented that.

I suggd Bermuda, where U.S. base.   He jumped at that.

	Called in R.A.B., Sw., Sal and decided to accept.  To refuse wd. have stultified what I have recently said re mtgs.

	Lady C. and W. E. will be there.

	Queen approves.



Sal.	Good.  Follows on P.M.’s speech.  E. has followed P.M.’s lead.



R.A.B.	Cdn’t avoid French being in.  They wd. have pushed in.



S.W.	Told Doms. Govt.  And H.C.’s in Ldn this a.m. – all delighted.



P.M.	Govt. House must provide conference centre.



			General approval.

P.M.	 3-4 days.  Mght. go on to W’ton with him, for a refresher at Pentagon.  Prof. wd. join me there.  Alex might come later &amp; stay on.





1.	    Egypt

				

P.M. 	O.L. told Nicholson tht. if state of war occurred with E., we wd. send 2 Battns. to Khartoum.  Govr. Genl. heard fr. him &amp; sent me a v. snuffy telegram.



O.L.	I stopped in K. and spoke to Howe in sense desired by P.M.

	Astonishing attitude by Howe &amp; his circle.  Effect of troops wd. turn all out friends v. us.  We are neutrals – trustees.  Contemplating having E. negotiator’s in S., even if war with E.  Bribery going on : we can’t stop it.



S.Ll.	Intelligence system in S. had bn. allowed to run down completely.
