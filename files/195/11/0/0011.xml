C.C. 3(53)							20th January, 1953



		1.	Estimates Committee.			[Enter B.H., Att.G.



A.E.	Corrce. with Glyn.  There may be trouble.  Warn colleagues.





		2.	Party Publications : Use of Queen’s Portrait.



M.F.	Memo. circulated.

	Dudley &amp; Stourbridge – Coronn. Year Book : shots of Queen facing U.S.C. photo &amp; statement below that Tory Party is national – representg. all classes.

	Opposn. know of this.  Local assocn. have declined to explain.



	Courses	a) Statement by Central Office.

			b) Reply to PQ

			c) Wait and see what Wigg does.



	Danger : Wigg may ask wthr. this action accords with the rules.  We prob. have as Govt. responsibility for use of Royal portraits – tho’ none for Stourbridge organn.

	Shd. we take initiative?  Risk is tht. we appear to assume, as Ministers, more respons. than we need.



Sw.	Circular of guidance to all Assocns. fr. Central Office.  We shall have done what we can.  Also some fools may be restrained.

	Better case in H/C. if it is raised.

	Issue by Central Office in form in wh. it cd. be made public if necessary.



R.A.B.	Agree – subject to verbal amendmts. – esp. no reference to Morrison.



		Agreed :	M.F. to arrange for this to be done today.

				Commn. to go to Chairman &amp; agent in each 			assocn.



A.E.	Shd. Central Office publish it when issued?



R.A.B.	Let it take its course – no special action.





		3.	Parliamentary Privilege.



Att.G.	Saw Spk. y’day.  Gave him record of procdgs in Kenya.  His provisional view was tht. he shd. adhere to his earlier ruling.

	Soskice, who consulted me, agreed with this view : but warned that they might feel obliged to press it.



A.E.	Thanks.  Take note.

							[Exit Att.G.

		4.	Central African Federation.



Sw.	Agreement is now in sight.



		(a)  All 4 Govts. want simultaneous publn. of W. Paper in each 			country.

		Propose tht. O.L. shd. announce today W.Paper will be available as 		soon as poss. after Confce. ends &amp; m’while no statement.

	Will be in Vote Office on 5/2 – Press on 6/2. – delay of 8 days after end of Conference.  Lobby Conference 4/2.



	I will also tell Lobby tht. suggn. of abrogn. of Afr. Affairs Bd. powers is w’out foundation.  Huggins agrees to my doing so.

	Salisbury will write to Times (Haley) about his leader.  I told Lobby there would be no disclosure while Conference was proceeding.



O.L.	Hope H/C. will be content to wait for 8 days.



		(b)  Time table for Legislation.

	Referendum in Rhodesia at end/March or early April.  Other legislatures will approve at same time.  New adminn. shd. be apptd. in Aug.  Our legn. must pass before then – &amp; convenient that contentious procdgs. on it shd. be over before Coronation.



H.C.	Have allowed for this in P’mme.



O.L.	Hostile 2nd Rdg.  But cd. avoid advance debate (in Govt. time) on Wh.Paper : tho’ if they take it on Supply Day (as v. likely) one day wd. suffice for 2nd Rdg.  



Sw. 	1st is that we want completed before Coronation.

							[Exit B.H.

							[Enter T.D. &amp; H.G.

		5.	Cereals’ Control.



T.D.	Early Jan. threat of genl. row with farmers – let down on Pt. I.  They sent to all branches lr. suggesting break with Govt. was inevitable.  V. general anxiety.

	In last 2 wks., much consultn. : re-assurg. statement by me on 10/1, welcomed in statement by them.  Private mtg. (R.A.B. &amp; me) last week.  As result, whole posn. altered – by R.A.B.’s plea for statesmanship on both sides.



	I met them all on Friday : &amp; I got away with it.  Agreed statement of re-assurances : aide memoire to help them to allay anxiety among farmers.  On procedure, they wanted to damp down publicity but wanted somethg. to refer to if challenged.  I promised to consider how the statement cd. be publd. Right moment is when M/F. present his W.Paper.  Re-assurance with minimum publicity. R.A.B. was doubtful &amp; advised us to come to Cabinet.



	N.I. mtg. today.  Think they can hold posn. w’out publd. statement.

	Scotl.   “    “    “.  They are more hopeful than they were.  Private session with announcemt. later wh. will say consultn. with Ministers has taken place &amp; early Govt. statement is expected.

	E. &amp; W. next week.  They will want publn. of statement.

	I still favour doing it at end of M/F. Lobby Confce. tomorrow on Wh.Paper.



R.A.B.	New idea.  But if nothg. is said it will look mysterious.

	Turner recognised need for new kind of Annual Review.  Don’t yet know what form it will take.  Danger of saying too much now : will or may be misinterpreted.



H.G.	Am against makg. this statement at all.  No ques. h’to of a Govt. statement – because of impending Annual Review.  Refce. to economic price – interpreted differently &amp; will involve charge of breach/faith.

	On one interpetn. wd. cost Ty. £5M. on eggs alone.  More on other commodities.

	Needed to allay anxiety.  Poultry Keepers have increased substantially orders to hatcheries since de-control of eggs was announced.  That reflects confidence – not lack of it.



T.D.	They have got the document.  Can’t imply that we don’t stand by it.



R.A.B.	“An element of consumer demand will be brought in, this year &amp; in future Reviews”.

	That was Turner’s statemt.  Cd. we add it to the statement.



		Agreed :  R.A.B. to settle wording with T.D. and H. George.

			   Omit “realistic &amp; economic” and substitute other 			   words preferably in terms used in Agric. Act, 1947.

			   But don’t risk a row on substitution of words, e.g. add 		   “In accordance with this policy ….” and retain 			   original words.



							[Exit H.G. and T.D.

		6.	Miners’ Wages.			[Enter Watkinson &amp; G.H.



L.	Negotns. with N.U.M.  N.C.B. have offered 6/= to lower paid men, 140.000.

	N.U.M. suggest 15/= for 420.000 men.  This can’t be entertained, esp. as men are working ill.

	Arbitn.?  N.U.M. are unwilling to go to Tribunal – a serious development.

	N.U.M. now realise they must go to Tribunal or accept 6/=.  Believe they will accept 6/= but will warn tht. trouble will follow all over country.

	I think there will be some in certain areas, but not universal.

	Doubt if N.U.M. will try to stop local trouble, but believe it won’t last v. long.

	Daren’t encourage N.C.B. to go beyond 6/=.  Tribunal wd. not give as much.

	Must take risk of possible trouble – drop in output (already bad) and even some isolated strike action.



W.	Support this line.

	More generally – risk of provokg. another cycle of wage increases, if other T.U.’s think Horner has got away with it.



L.	Miners may approach Govt.

	Want assurance tht. Govt. will support N.C.B.



G.H.	We risk strikes in Scotl. &amp; Wales – under wh. Govt. might be disposed to give way.

							[Exit Watk.



		7.	Persia.



A.E.	We put up a satisf. ‘package’.  M. hasn’t accepted it – twisting.

	We are standing pat. tho’ U.S. are not.  U.S. wd. drop “enterprise” – we won’t.



	Shall send message to Dulles tonight.

							[Exit G.U.



		8.	Sudan.



A.E.	Reported discussion &amp; drew attention to telegrams despatched.

	We shall m’tain our view, despite disagreemt. of Howe and Stevenson.





		9.	Germany.



A.E.	Reported facts.  2 room-full’s of documents seized.  May be somethg. in it.

	Tels. etc. can now be circulated to Cab.

	Adenauer wished us luck in private – tho’ he is a bit sharp in public.





		10.	Malaya : Use of Tear Gas.



O.L.	New tear gas – B.B.C. : purely lachrymatory.

	Will be used to beat them up in jungle.  Not persistent.



		Authorised.
