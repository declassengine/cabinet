C.C. 44(53).				21st July, 1953.



	Regency.		[Enter  B.H., S.Ll.



R.A.B.	Form of answer to P.Q.



Sw.	Approve.  Shows it originated before the rumours re Princess M.

	Square C.R.A. to shut down any awkward supplementaries.  *Agreed.





	1.	Transport : London Fares.      [Enter  A.L-B., Marples, de L., T.D.



ALB.	Increases being announced to-day:  award of Tribunal.

	Done our best to deal with pol. angle by independent enquiry into

		Ldn Transport.





	2.	Gatwick Airport.



Sim.	Aut Gatwick aut nihil. 



R.A.B.	Total cash needed – for this &amp; P’wick.



Sim.	J.S. wants somethg. said at same time re P’wick – to allay Sc. fears. 



A.L.B.	Ready to add sentence re-iterating intentn. to proceed with P’wick as

		our 2nd. internatl. airport.  Put it in W. Paper as well as statement.

	Have reduced estimate by £½M.  Ty. may now allow us to go ahead

		slowly – satisfy Sc. opinion.



Sim.	P.7.  Security experts want this refce. to B’bushe omitted.



AL.B.	A necessary argument : must make it clear tht. development taking

		place there is not substitute for Gatwick but quite independent.



			Sim. to sort out this wording.



Ch.	Believe it wd. be cheaper to clear Heathrow of fog.



W.	How urgent is this?  Wd. have liked to have this on a reserve of public

		works against a recession.



A.L.B.	V. low labour force:  wd. make v. small contn. to unemplt.

	Must abandon N’holt in 55/56.  Alternative must be ready by 56/7.

		Will take 3½ yrs. to make even diversionary road.

	The work will be done in a year or so – not now.



Sim.	In reply to Ch. – it’s not only fog, also pressure of traffic.

		Supplementary as well as alternate.

A.L.B.	Discns. re Fido are procdg.  Soln. is not in sight.  And much more

		expensive.  Even then 100 items a day.



Ch.	If it is volume, I accept posn.



Sw.	Alternative for Atlantic : supplementary for Continental.



R.A.B.	Hope M/C.A. will keep w’in ceilings for investment agreed.

		Ordinary Ty. control over exp’re. on Gatwick.

	Enquiry?



Sim.	P.M. thght. it shd. come before policy announcement.

		M/H. &amp; M/C.A. both agree tht. opposite order is correct.

		National policy shd. be laid down before local adaptations are

		considered.  Doubtful if local details enquiry wd. satisfy local 

		opinion.



M.	Has bn. promised, if there are local objns. – wh. surely there will be.



A.L.B.        x/	Shall have to concede it.  But must be limited to local ques.

	Wd. repeat offer of local enquiry if there is a demand for it.

	Cd. discuss t. of r. before any debate.



M.	T &amp; C.P. Act enquiry :  limited to local ques:  M/C.A. to be repd. to

		answer ques of fact on national policy.

	There will be a row.  Better to say in W. Paper tht. we have given 

		weight to local opinion.   Suggd. alternative form of para. 13.



Sw.	That won’t do : can’t p’pone “final decision”.



A.L.B.	Cd. add a sentence to effect of x/.  Remain firm on national policy :

		consider local objns. on detail of plan.



			Agreed :  Sim. to adjust wording, with Ministers concerned.

			                Announce Wednesday (if ready).

			                                     [Exit  de. L., T.D., A.L.B., Marples.



	3.	Foreign Affairs.



S.	B’ground to telegrams.

	Purposes : re-affirm existg. policies re Germany : to support A in that :

			to press for E.D.C. : to discourage D. fr. precipitate action

			in satellites : re-affirm w. defence : keep door open for 

			4 Power Mtg.

	Have m’tained w. unity on all policies.

	Have encouraged N.A.T.O. &amp; Europ. unity.

	Re-committed Fr. to E.D.C.

	Delayed D. in dangerous initiatives.  Believe it was E.’s simple

		outlook : harry R. whenever you can by any means.  E.g. Free

		Corps in G.  Policy of pinpricks – ben/ or mal/evolent.

		Dulles cd. not have bn. more helpful.  B. tiresome because

		Parly. diffies.

	Ques. wh. may come up –

	1)	Four Power.  Why did U.S. change their attitude?  A. &amp; R.

		helped.

		Adenauer’s lr. was much more effective than my pleading.

		R. enquiries re accommn. in Switz. for a 4-Power Mtg.

			Why abandon P.M.’s plan?  Because Ike opposed it on

		constitutional grounds – Head of State mustn’t argue.  Fr. wdn’t

		have liked a “no-agenda” mtg.

			Why not E.D.C. as pre-condition.  I pressed B. v. hard:

		he is still furious with me.  D. said, if Fr. contd. to hold this up,

		U.S. will be driven into relying on peripheral defence:  view of

		Congress as well as Admin’s  But B. said no Fr. Govt. cd.

		ratify at present – wd. be defeated.

	2)	F/East.  Discns. were incomplete.  Not enough time to do it

		properly – only 1 Session on it.  No report then on Rhee convns.

		D.’s policy re Korea.  Armistice : he asserts has got satisf.

		assurances tht. Rhee won’t obstruct.  Pol. Confce. : limit of 

		90 days – after wh. he mght, with Rhee, break it off – to prevent

		Comm. fr. stringing along &amp; then brkg. armistice.

		Pledged to pursue re-unifn. of K. ; but expects fr. Conf. no more 

		than tempy. stabiln. of status quo.  Attempt re-unifn. on basis of 

		neutralisn. in 5 or 10 yrs. time.  Wants neutralisn.

		Breach of Arm.  By S.K. :  he wasn’t afraid of that.  Optimistic :

		but based on i) U.S./K. Treaty of Mut. Security  ii) U.S.

		promise of economic help.  Rhee wd. be reluctant to lose either.

			By. Comm.  U.S. &amp; U.N. wd. again support “rotatn. of

		peace &amp; security”.  Milder version of 1952 warning statement.

		W’out old threat of extendg. area of conflict.  Suggd. tht., as gist

		of it in communiqué, it mght. not be needed:  D. promised to 

		consider whr. publn. of it cd. be avoided.

	3)	Egypt.  V. frank : U.S. pretty hard.  But did some good.

			Our aim : get U.S. to let us play hand &amp; under-write us.

			Rejected negotn. on N.’s plan.  Urged them to say merely

			they had handed it to us.  They were stiff on that.  D. gave

			us Ike’s view on our M/E. policy.  Tried to answer that.

			R. was v. good on detail.

			They wdn’t endorse our plan in toto.  Agreed to bless 

			principles.

			Lr. wh. went to N. is v. firm &amp; good.  Passes ball to us.

			R. has retd. to Cairo.  Won’t initiate talks, but ready to

			receive callers.  Better begin informally.

			Instruct R. to stand firm on our principles : B. offr. in

			control B. troops &amp; material : discretion to accept 10 yr.

			duration if our formula won’t go : our formula on

			re-activation (wh. Eisenh. endorsed).

		Presentn.  Continuity of policy.  Restrained optimism.  Soln. can

			be found if R. want it.  Stand firm &amp; feel our way fwd. to 

			calmer times.

		Endorse lines of R.A.B.’s draft speech.

		I will make only a v. brief statement in H/L. – promising

			elaborn. in H/L. debate on 29/7.



Sw.	What will U.S. do if no results after 90 days.



S.	Resume fighting – or threaten it.

	Mtg. of U.N.?  In N. Yk. there is a feeling in favour.  Said no use

		while chance remains of U.S. getting agreement.  But if break-		down after 90 days – [or failure to get armistice] – U.N. wd.

		have to meet.

	No refce. made to B. re-inforcement fr. H. Kong to K.

	Heads of State idea : D. didn’t dissent from it.



P.T.	Strategic controls.  For how long?



S.	They asked first “until final settlement of K.”  But they dropped it.



R.A.B.	Shd. we answer McCarthy Report?



S.	Not to-day in debate.  Later, at length.  Deny it shortly, m’while.



S.Ll.	H/L. debate mght be a good opportunity for full answer.



R.A.B.	I’m followg. P.M. speech of 11/5 &amp; stressing continuity.  P.M. wants 

		some refce. to Locarno idea.



S.	Not mentioned in W’ton.



RAB.	Cd. I repeat what P.M. said &amp; add refce. to Anglo-Sov. Treaty.



S.	Keep it v. general : it won’t go well with Allies.



S.Ll.	And don’t use word Locarno.



S.	U.S. regard R. as devils : cdn’t bear thght of siding with them.



	Unification of G.

 

S.	Settled policy.  D. thinks safest method wd. be w’in E.D.C.



	Egypt.



RAB.	P.M. wanted me to say we wd. negotiate alone &amp; don’t want U.S. as 

		mediators.



S.	Don’t say that.  For U.S. will allow us to do so.  Don’t give impn. tht.

		I don’t trust them to keep their word.  Wd. be positively insulting.



S.Ll.	Party in H/C. are v. worried about E.  Asked if policy cd. come to them

		before we are finally committed.			[Exit  A.

O.L.	Not sure about 10 years.  Shd. we not have provn. for negotiating a 

		renewal or modifn. in 8th. or 9th. year.



		*Cabt. to consider this again on Thursday.*



	*Expressions of congratn. and thanks to S. on results of mission.





	4.	Persian Gulf.



S.	No doubt U.S. are v. much excited about this – all of them.

	Arab world shd. be peaceful &amp; on our side.  Be-devilled by a few ques.

		They are v. worried about their oil.  And frightened about

		Ibu Saud.  Ike also thinks this is just another example of our 

		re-actionary M/E. policy.

	Cab. 	considered 4 courses on last occasion.

		Ike won’t accept (iii).

		We must try to make some concession to meet U.S. view.  They

		don’t realise clearly how much our interests are engaged.  Say 

		we just can’t do anythg. implying tht. T. has any right to be

		where he is.  We are therefore willing to carry on as now – no

		arbitn., no change.  And if U.S. say must go to U.N., reply – 

		splendid, we have a good case.  More diff. for U.S. to refuse 

		acquiescence.  Lesser of 2 evils is tht. we lose arbitn. pro tem.



W.M.	Our interests are v. great indeed.  U.S. trying to muscle in (oil cos.).





	5.	Civil Service.



RAB.	Chairman : Sir Raymond Priestley.





	6.	The Prime Minister.



R.A.B.	P.M. is v. considerably restored in health.  Physical &amp; mental powers

		are in gt. vigour.  Going to Chequers on Friday., where A.E. will

		join him.





	7.	Antarctica.



RAB.	Minute from P.M.  Refer to S., to discuss with other Ministers

		concerned.

	Don’t depart fr. my view.

	Will S. submit further report to Cabinet.
