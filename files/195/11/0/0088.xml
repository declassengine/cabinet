C.C. 5(54).				26th January, 1954.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  B-C., B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week – provisional.

	Progress on Bills of medium importance – wh. will keep pol. temp.

		low.





	2.	Cabinet:  Meetings.



P.M.	H.M.’s commitment in Standg. Cttee. cdn’t attend until end/July.

		Considered therefore possibility of reverting to old system of 

		 weekly mtg. on Wedy.  Propose Wed. a.m. as regular time:

		with Mon. or Thurs. p.m. as addl. times.



H.C.	Sc. Grand Cttee. meets Tues. &amp; Wed.  Also, when tempo increases,

		other Cttees. sometimes meet on Wed. mornings as well.

	But on balance Wed. wd. be easier.



M.F.	Try Wednesdays.  For next month or so, it wd. be convenient.



			Agreed.    Wednesday :  addl. mtg. Monday 4.30 p.m.





	3.	Five-Power Conference.



P.M.	Tel. No. 12.

	Surely it is clear tht. we shd. go for this, if Dulles is taking 

		reasonable attitude.  Favour encouraging reply to A.E.



Sal.	Agree.  But limited to F/E. (as A.E. suggests) not world-wide

		(as R. now wish).



P.M.	I will inform A.E. accordingly.





	4.	Suez Canal.



P.M.	Don’t delay in efforts to mobilise maritime Powers.

	Push on with this.



				[Enter  A.H.

	5.	Egypt.



S.Ll.	E. are putting out feelers on new availability formula.

	We think we shd. set a limit, once we know what we do next –

		leaving interval for U.S. repns.

	Suggest as alternative :  decision to re-deploy, wind up Base, but not

		evacuate Egypt, standing on our Treaty rights.

P.M.	We shd. have full discn. on Thursday, on basis of F.O. memo.



Sal.	Shd. announce decn. re E. before it becomes known we are preparing

		bolt-hole in Cyprus.  That wd. look like a scuttle.



Al.	Not a scuttle to remove M/E H.Q. fr. Canal Zone.



Sal.	So long as it is made clear what we are doing &amp; intend.



P.M.	Must have clear policy for future, failing agreemt. with E.

	Then set public time-limit, leavg. room for U.S. repns.



			                                  [Enter  Watk. de. L., J.T., C.O.S.,

			                                               H.H., A.L.B.

	6.	Middle East :  Re-deployment Plan.



Al.	As in memo.

	No actual move at present.  Need for progress in planning.



P.M.	Why bring para. brigade home?



Al.	Valuable part of world strategic reserve – available for use anywhere.

	Can be kept secret.



P.M.	Timing is reserved for Cab. decn. in reln. to E. and M/E. policy.



A.H.	Works shd. proceed in Cyprus :  it is in hand now.



H.H.	Well known in Cyprus that this is coming along.



			Approved, as plan :  timing reserved for Cab. decision.



			                                          [Enter  Sw.

			                                          [Exit  C.O.S., Serv.Min., 

			                                                    H.H.  B.H.

	7.	British Industries Fair.



	There is diffce. betwn. Ch. &amp; other Communists.

	We shall offend U.S. opinion.

		Feeling against it.  See if P.T. accepts that as a decision

			or wants to discuss on Thursday.





	8.	Industrial Disputes.



W.	Threat of strike in buses outside Ldn.

	Seeing both sides this p.m. – will try to get settlement on 7/=, as

		agreed in Ldn.

	Failing settlement, Ct. of Enquiry is next move:  but don’t want 

		too many of them.

	May be trouble in light-castings industry.



	Electrical contractors.  Best to let it go on &amp; hope they will get sick

		of it.  Expensive to them.

	Argument betwn. E.T.U. and Albert Hall.  Have asked Ld. Ch. &amp;

		Att. Genl. to consider wtr there is anything in this in the nature

		of conspiracy.  Possibly a co. might start an action.



Sim.	It is an aspect to watch.  Presume advisers of Albert Hall have it in

		mind.  But dangerous ground to tread on.  For they cd. turn it

		into a trade dispute on the “closed shop” issue – avoiding any

		suggn. tht. their action was in retaliation for refusal to allow 

		them to use Albert Hall.
