C.C. 58 (53)					15th October, 1953



98.	    Parliament.			  [Enter O.P., D.S., P.B-H., J.B-C



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Followg. week – F. Aff. debate in addn. to remaing. natn. debates.  If one day suffices, H/C can rise on the Thursday.

					[Enter Munster



1.	    Queens’ Speeches.



Prorogation Speech.   Approved subject to amendment.

Opening Speech.



H.C.	i) Road Traffic Acts.  Substitute vague formula, not promising legn.



L.P.	ii) Judges’ Salaries.  Read lr. from R.A.B.



A.E.	Can we tell 1922 Cttee. in advance of publn. of Bill?



PBH.	Cd. tell a few.



W.	Need for delay?



J.B-C.	Wage claims.



W.M.	We must face that : &amp; present it as somthg. diff.  I don’t ask for delay.



A.E.	If it is mentioned in Speech, introdn. of legn. shd. follow w’out delay.  Then we can explain to 1922 Cttee.



D.S.	iii) Atomic Energy.  W. Paper hasn’t bn. presented.  Awkward to invite premature debate on Address.  Suggest omission of 19.

		Experience on steel industry W. Paper confirms this view.	

					  [Exit H.C.

Sal.	Cd. fob off in debate by saying W. Paper is about to be laid.



H.M.	Better avoid discn. until we are agreed on the scheme.



					Agreed.  Omit para.19.

Sal.	(iv) Para. 13.  No reference to c/living.



			



	R.A.B. can’t find anything wh. wdn’t commit Govt. unduly.



				[Exit O.P., Munster

			                                  [Enter 21/2 Serv. Ministers.  21/2 C.O.S.







1.	    Egypt.



A.E.	Availability.  Submitted amended formula.



			Agreed : Try this on.



P.M.	Lr. from L.S.A.  70.000 wd. be needed only for defensive policy.  But an active offensive cd. reduce E. to a point at which we could, afterwards, revert to a much smaller garrison.



A.E.	The offensive period wd. require much more than 70.000.  And for how long wd. they have to stay if they had to support a nominee Govt.



Al.	More troops wd. be needed if we attempted occupn. of Cairo.



Sal.	Hankey holds same view as L.S.A. – and says 10,000 wd. suffice.



P.M.	But we cd. cut off oil, st. balances &amp; send 2 battns. to Khartoum.

And it wd. be easily defensible to do those things, if they did anything equivalent to an act of war.

	Keep negotns. open – delay final agreemt. – until we have bn. able to talk to ’22 Cttee.  See what they say.



A.E.	Canal clause &amp; this availability clause will please Party.

	We must make this   ..       ..       a breaking point.

	

	Appendix to C.281.



A.	Agreed.



Al.		B.	Assuming we start as soon as principles agreed &amp; 3 mos. elapse before final ratification. As in memo.



C.  4.000 for 41/2 years.  Next 18 months 2.500 includg. R.A.F.  Last year of the 7 

	and 	D. we cd. accept 1.000 + R.A.F. (750 wd. suffice, but 1.000 sounds better).   If insprs. only, 200 wd. suffice.  After the 7 years, assume some plan for carrying on – wdn’t get them to accept an increase then.



			Agreed.

	

C.	As above.



D.	Uniform.  Alternatives formula.  As in ms. – but reserving 2nd sentence as something R. can tell them but not include in formal agreement.



de.L.	Abandonment of airfields.  Base is of illusory value, militarily.



C.A.S.	It is only for reasons of prestige that the Base is useful now.



A.E.	Title : Senior B. Officer, Canal Zone Base.  Told Rob. that is best.



			Agreed : Confirm that he stands to that.

			Agreed :  Tell old Doms.  Be ready to warn &amp; explain to 	

			               new Doms if there is a break.  



			F.O. &amp; C.R.O. to consult.
