C.C. 51(53).				8th September, 1953.





	1.	The Cabinet.                      [Enter  A.H., A.N., V.C.I.G.S., P.B-H.,

			                                           J.T. – Leathers.



P.M.	Welcomed 3 new Members.  F.H. first woman member of a 

		Tory Cabinet.





	2.	Germany.



P.M.	Welcomed election of Adenauer.

	Referred to Ward’s tel. 831.  A valuable declaration.





	3.	Dunkirk Memorial.



A.H.	As in memo.



RAB.	Prefer smaller sum.



Al.	Don’t wish to have any memorial – of our defeat at Dunkirk.



			Agreed : smaller memorial – or, rather, no national

			                       memorial.	[Exit  J.T.

				[Enter  Brian Robertson.



	4.	Egypt.



P.M.	Details outstanding are not of gt. importce. – so far as concerns protn.

		of Base.  But need for care because impact on p. opinion, wh.

		hasn’t bn. familiar with detail of negotn.  Fear we may have 

		sharp re-action fr. Tory Party.  Disturbed.



R.A.B.	Have kept in touch with Party feeling.  There are anxieties.

	We need agreement : we shall have to stomach some details we don’t

		like.  If it is our policy to get agreemt., we must stand firm on

		some things (e.g. uniformed men so that attack wd be act of 

		war) – and secure principle of re-activation : but can compromise

		on other, more detailed, points.

	Do we bring in Canal as part of agreement?  Can we link it?

	Are we satisfied on re-activation?



P.M.	Memo. fr. Leathers on Canal.  Most people think purpose of base

		is to protect Canal.  This may be moment at wh. to bring it in.



L.	Unless we insist now on free navign. thro’ Canal….  We have taken

		lead, among Powers, in securing it.  Must not sacrifice it now.



P.M.	Cd. we plan on this basis?  Wd. accept 7-year duration.  On

		re-activation, we must have a reference to U.N. to cover 

		contingency of major war;  but that wd. suffice.  Indicate 

		readiness to agree on that basis, but insist first on public

		understanding re future of Suez Canal.



B.R.	E. have to make a no. of concessions – e.g. uniform, 5 yrs to 7 on

		duration, no. of technicians etc., Believe we can put E. over

		those hurdles.  Re-activation : they will accept U.N. formula.

		They won’t accept mention of Turkey.

	Canal.  E. wd. accept respons. for its defence &amp; agree tht. we shd. 

		come in to help if it were attacked.  E. wd. re-affirm existg. 

		obligns.  But diff. to get guarantee v. their bad faith – or

		cessation of blockade on Israeli traffic.



A.N.	U.S. won’t help on free transit.  They wdn’t join us in pressing E. to

		let the oil go thro’ to Haifa.  They may be influenced by 

		Panama.  We can’t get their support : we have tried.

	We may have to ask them to back us up on def. agreemt.  We don’t

		want to prejudice that approach to them by introducg. new 

		matter re Canal over wh. they have not bn. helpful.



R.A.B.	Prob. can’t get full settlement on Canal.  But get as much as we can

		on it, for encouragemt. of publ. opinion.



L.	Cd. we refer to Canal in preamble of def. agreement?



A.N.	Choice :	(i)   value reference in preamble.

			(ii)  join with maritime Powers in getting somethg. firmer.

	(i) may be so vague tht. it will have no effect on p. opinion.



P.M.	Cd. do (i) now and proceed later with (ii) in separate agreement.



B.R.	Shd. hope to get (i).  Try to get a useful statement in preamble.



P.M.	Let us have Cttee. to evolve formula for considn.

		by Cab. on 17th.



			*L., A.N., B.R., RAB (in touch), Sw. :

			       L.P.S. (Chairman).  O.L.



	Military Action in Canal Zone.



P.M.	Is situation so serious?  Much less tense than pre-Ismailia.

		Surely it has improved.

	If situation does deteriorate, we can deal with it when it comes.



Al.	Delegn. of Cab. authy. wd. be useful.





P.M.	If no time to call Cab., P.M. or anyone acting for him cd. decide.

		No need for formal authy.

			{  genl. agreemt. with memo.  Sitn. will be dealt with 

			{  if and as situation requires.



B.R.	Quiet at moment because E. Govt. has so directed.  They cd. stir it up.

		Good many incidents : stop-gap measures don’t help : wholesale

		action is needed, if any.  If it does get worse, they will want to 

		act on a bigger scale.



P.M.	Cd. charge E. damages, v. sterling balances.  E.g. £100.000 p.d. for

		“increased vigilance”.

	If that didn’t work, I wd. cut oil : to a ration basis.

	No Rodeo.



RAB.	1273 Cairo refers to additional aid.  I favour status quo.  Our existg.

		agreement is in our favour.  These are now normal trade 

		balances.



P.M.	No more money until agreement made &amp; good atmosph. restored.

			No decision on para. 11 of Cairo Tel. pro tem.





	5.	Burma:  Defence Agreement.



Al.	B. want changes in status &amp; purpose of our Mil. Mission.

	Ready to agree, as long as Mission is not to pass under B. control.

	Little difference in fact, mainly in form.

	B. don’t like Mission screening their lists of mil. requirements.

	71 in Mission now.  Shd. send no more.  Prob. wd. be fewer.

	Value is mainly political &amp; financial &amp; strategic.  No value fr.

		narrow mil. angle.



R.A.B.	They owe us £30/40 M.  But hoping to get something. back thro’

		re-starting oil there.

	They will pay for this.



A.H.	Don’t want to post people compulsorily to B.  Need therefore to 

		get attractive terms fr. Burmese.



			Agreed:  no increase in numbers.

				[Exit  AH., VCIGS.



	6.	United Nations : Chinese Representation.



A.N.	D. has re-acted ill to our formula, and seems intransigent.

		We can try other formulae.  But it looks as tho’ we mayn’t

		succeed.

	If U.S. insist on moratorium for whole year, do we vote with them

		or abstain.  We cdn’t vote against, for we shd. then be with

		those who favour seating red China at once.

	If we vote with, we stultify recent speeches by S. and RA.B.

	I therefore favour abstaining.

	If Dutch submit amendmt. on lines of our formula, we shall find

		if diff. to vote v. that.  Posn. wd. be more complex.  No time

		for further reference home.



R.A.B.	We hope wider issues of F/E. will develop fr. Pol. Confce.

	We ought therefore to keep posn. open.

	Our formula is therefore best.  Try it again with U.S.  If we fail,

		we can only abstain.



P.M.	We are running gt. risks with U.S. – Anglo/U.S. relations.

	U.S. cd. say – vote them in &amp; we will w’draw.



Ch.             *	Try: not to be considered until state of war (i.e. peace) is ended:  

		a peace settlement with Korea.



P.M.	Can’t vote v. them.

	Cd. we put our pt. of view &amp; then vote with them?



			Agreed :  Try * on U.S.

			                Avoid rift with U.S.



P.M.	Or for a year or until settlement is reached, whichever

		is the first.

				[Exit  A.N.

				[Enter  Watkinson.



	7.	Persia.



P.M.	Read exchange of messages with Zahidi.





	8.	Farm Prices : Special Review.



T.D.	Discretion on form &amp; timing of announcement.



R.A.B.	Support this.  But it is a bold pol. decision.  Farmers will be angry.

		Means tht. we shall have to be easier with them on other ques

		e.g. barley.





	9.	Electricians’ Strike.



P.M.	New &amp; sinister techniques.

	Parlt. mght discuss, even after it’s over.







W.	One more mtg. this p.m.  Unlikely to succeed.  If we fail, we shall

		appoint Ct. of Enquiry to-night.

	Moderate T.U.’s at I. of M. Conference have expd. hope tht.

		employers will succeed.



P.M.	Enquiry will be useful – will elicit facts re new techniques, 

		obviously Communist inspired.



W.	Court’s appointment. won’t necessarily stop the strike.





	10.	Procedure.



	Next mtg. Thursday, Sept. 17.
