C.C. 4(54).				21st January, 1954.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  D.S., B-C., B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Non-controversial because of narrow majority.

	In following week, annual Welsh debate.



				[Enter  Maudling, G.Ll.

	2.	European Coal &amp; Steel Community.	[Exit  B-H.



A.E.	Qua f. affairs wd. like to go as far as we can to meet Monnet’s views.

		Wd. be helpful qua E.D.C. if we cd. be as closely associated as

		possible.

	We made it clear to M. we cdn’t infringe sovereignty or contravene

		existg. commercial commitmts.  He has met us on both points.

	Single market for steel wd. be to our advantage.  On coal we cdn’t go

		so far.

	Suggest Ministers consider again in a month – to avoid delay in 

		replying to M.



Sw.	Free entry for steel from Doms.  C. &amp; A. are exporters to U.K., prs. on

		increasing scale.  Proposed here tht. we shd. reduce tariff to 0, 

		giving free entry, for Eur. steel to U.K. &amp; Colonies : but Doms. 

		wdn’t get free entry to Europe.  Shdn’t Doms. have that?



D.S.	Wd. involve reciprocity.  Wd. Austr. admit Eur. steel w’out tariff?



Sw.	Ugh!



D.S.	Doubt if Dom. steel imports into U.K. will amount to much.



Sw.	Cd. we at least offer to try to get them in, on reciprocal basis, if they

		wished.



M.	V. far-reachg.  RAB shd. have chance to express view before we 

		commit ourselves.



P.T.	Agree.  Avoid decn. in principle until consultns. are completed.

	Wd. like discns. in Ldn., so tht. senior officials can participate.

	Cd. accept App. B :  but fear we shall be pressed to go beyond it.



A.E.	Proposals in para 3. don’t commit you to much.  Consultns. with

		industry &amp; informal talks with M. before anything like a final

		commitmt. is reached.



G.Ll.	Coal :  econ. arguments are balanced – therefore pol. consns. turn scale.		Want to talk now to N.C.B:  believe Chairman cd. handle the

		miners.



P.T.	Consultn. with engineering industry also?



D.S.	Have that in hand – with my advisory Council.

	Steel Bd. – will go along if told pol. consns. point that way.



P.T.	Econ. and pol. risks are greater than as stated in this memo.



W.M.	Para. 38:  diffies. of common market for coal.  N.C.B. shd. be fully

		consulted :  for paras 41-2 indicates concern re view of N.U.M.,

		on wh. Houldsworth is the best judge.



			Memo. (para. 3) approved.





	3.	East West Trade.



A.E.	On reflection doubt if I can do anything in Berlin.  Shan’t get agreemt.		with U.S. in time.  But if anything particular emerges wh. cd. be

		raised, let me know while the Mtg. is on.



P.M.	We haven’t surrendered right to our own view in last resort.



A.E.	Battle Act wd. prevent them fr. giving us aid if we contravened

		agreed Anglo-U.S. policy.



P.M.	Report of officials will be ready Friday.

	Min. Cttee. shd. meet on Mon.  I will preside.			[Exit  D.S.





	4.	Persia.



A.E.	Diffy. with U.S.  May be greed or genuine trouble with anti-trust laws.

		They have asked for time before agreeing to our consortium plan.	Hoover returns to Ldn. at end/week.

	U.S. suggns. (i)  bring in some small U.S. companies.  Wd. let in other

			        small cos., Br. &amp; Eur.

			        Propose to resist this – on basis tht. big cos. can give

			        them a share if they like.

			  (ii) 50% for A.I.O.C.  U.S. claim that P. wdn’t agree.

			        Propose to stand firm on that.

			        But Shell (with 40% holding in R. Dutch) may have

			        to be used to secure 50% for British, tho’ not A.I.O.C.

			        interests.

	Shah is behaving ill.  Angry with Wright for dealing with Govt.

		He seems to be jealous of Zahedi.

			                                                [Exit  Maudling

			                                                [Enter  de L., A.H., CIGS. 

	5.	Jordan.



A.E.	Squadron shd. go now.

	We shd. also know what other forces they wd. like – King referred to

		that the other day &amp; we shd. know what he means.

	Israel :  they raised no objn. a year ago to our sending a brigade :

		they surely won’t object to a Squadron.  Shall explain, however.

		We are helping them in U.N. re ships:  this will improve our 

		relations with Israel.





	6.	Suez Canal:  Blockade.



P.M.	Wd. be helpful with opinion here (H/C) if we took up this ques more

		actively.  Mght. get Waterhouse &amp; Silverman supportg. this.

	Didn’t like our earlier decn. not to object to blockade of oil ships to

		Israel.  Now they are going much further.

	F.O. tel. of 14/1, was on right line in objectg. to E. extension of 

		blockade to things other than oil.



A.E.	Legal posn. isn’t strong.  E. has inherited rights when at war, &amp; she is

		technically at war with Israel.

	We must therefore keep in line with other maritime Powers.  If we cd.

		get them to join us in repns. to U.N.



P.M.	Wd. like to see our case v. Egypt move over from Base to Canal.

	Want to put into prominence our championship of free passage thro’

		Canal.



A.E.	Dispatch fr. Iraq – for 1st. time since war with Turkey, both I and T. 		are trying to get into closer touch.  Talk of a mission to Turkey,

		to see wtr our posn. in I. cd. be assimilated to that of U.S. in T.		Developmt. on these lines, if carefully guided, wd. draw I away

		fr. Egypt.



P.M.	When can we go to U.N. on Canal?



A.E.	Must get U.S. into line (Berlin) &amp; then 4 or 5 other maritime Powers.		Can tell Israel in a week or so what we are trying to do.

	Has bn. only one case of stopping a ship, so far:  Italian ship.

				[Exit  C.I.G.S. de L.

				[Enter  H.H. Att.G.

	7.	Kenya :  Court Martials.



A.H.	Two more cases have emerged – one v. Griffiths and another v. an 

		officer in K.A.R.

	V. unsavoury cases.

	Evidence for ct. martial.  Mil. duty to proceed.

	Cab. shd. know, however, because unsavoury nature of the affair.

	Poss. alternative wd. be to proceed summarily v. KAR officer.

	Discretion rests with Genl. Erskine.

			                                                     [Exit  Att.G. H.H. A.H.

			                                                     [Enter  Maudling. B-H.

	8.	Wages and Prices.



W.M.	Amount to .86 of a point altogether.

	V. awkward to have this coming out with Rpt. of Ct. of Enquiry.

	Recognise it means holding it up (butter) for a quarter.

	Some hope, thro’ consultns. with T.U.’s, of securing period of

		stability in wages.  Plan for this :  beginning with speech with

		R.A.B.  M’while, I have engineering dispute, as well as other

		minor ones.  I intend, if report is good, to take a positive line 

		on it with both sides.  Wdn’t have much chance if at same time

		price increases were being announced.



Ll.G.	4 points fall from June/Dec. in food content of c/living index.



W.M.	But no change fr. Dec. ’52 to Dec. ’53  109.3 : 109.6.



Ll.G.	Only method of testing is the index.

	Butter &amp; cheese will add .36.  But discounted already by 

		announcemts. already made.  Pork &amp; beef = .5 and has not

		bn. announced.



B-C.	Cost will be over £300 M. vice £220 aim.  Second suppl. for M/F.

		will be needed.  Contriby. cause is delay on M/L grounds of

		various price increases.

	Butter &amp; cheese, if not made now, can’t be made until Apl., just

		before de-control:  when it will look like consequence of

		decontrol.

	If increases made after wage settlemt., mght be a ground for

		re-opening it.



Sw.	Not only c/l. but c/food which is contention in current wage claim.



B-C.	We shall follow Labour in fixing a limit but failing to secure it because

		reluctant to increase prices.



Ll.G.	Cost of p’ponement wd. be £4 M. for butter &amp; cheese only :  £8M. for

		all.



B-C.	Pork &amp; bacon cost £40 M. in subsidy.

	Strong line in Annual Review wd. be helped if we cd. show tht. we

		mean to reduce cost by increasg. prices.



P.M.	Ty. will lose as much and more if there are strikes e.g. on export trade.



W.M.	Believe this is a critical moment in industrial field.

		Responsible T.U. leaders wd. support my plea for delay.

	I wd. even be ready to p’pone date of de-control of butter.



Sw.	Support M/L. view.



P.T.	So do I, on balance.  But worried at makg. increases soon

                    x|	   after settlement.



Ll.G.	Butter &amp; cheese have bn. announced already.



Sim.	Ct. of Enquiry will therefore take that into a/c.



A.E.	Reluctant to go back on what has bn. announced.

	Don’t want to do more – viz., pork &amp; beef.



W.	Concerned at x/.  Favour p’poning only pork &amp; beef.



W.M.	Must accept that decision.



	Agreed :	Butter &amp; cheese increases as planned.

			No increase for beef &amp; pork.
