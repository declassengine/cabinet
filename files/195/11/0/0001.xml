C.C. 101(52)							3rd December, 1952



		1.	Housing : Licensing of Private Building.    [Enter Sw. and B.H.



P.M.	Arises from Cab. decision of 20/11.  Seek greater bldg. of private houses.  Point outstanding was criterion of need.  Have met Ministers : we agree it wd. be wiser not to have a test – won’t provoke more Parly. row than we shall have anyhow, and will be more likely to get private bldg. going.  Many Soc. Councils wd. refuse licences on principle whatever the test of need.



R.A.B.	What no. of private houses do you expect to get?



P.M.	45.000 in 1953 and 80.000 in last year : completions (?)



J.S.	I support this.  We can say we are still bldg. more houses to let.





		2.	D. Scheme for Furniture.			[Enter H.S.



R.A.B.		Scheme for standards won’t now be ready after all.  Suggest I go on 		none the less.  If I p’pone to Fin. Bill, I shd. have a schedule with 			articles specified in it &amp; open way to amendments.



Sw.	P’ponement wd. not bring trade together on standards – on contrary, wd. give impn. of weakness.

							[Exit H.S.

							[Enter D.S.

		3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	To rise on 19/12, we shall have 3 more days on Transport, 1 on D. Scheme and one to spare (or rather unallocated : for Wales an C/Europe have bn. promised.)



	Delegated legn. : Cttee. has bn. agreed.  Opposn. insist on separate H/C. Cttee.



Sw.	Not a bad thing : our procedure is v. different.



H.C.	May be asked for a day on P.M.’s statement on Def. P’mme.



P.M.	Cd. make them wait until after N.A.T.O. &amp; W. Paper is pubd. in Feby.



A.E.	C/Europe : will be diff. for me.  C.E.C. may run until 12/12; and thereafter Paris (O.E.E.C. and N.A.T.O.).  I wd. prefer to be there e.g. Thurs. of next week.  Generally agreed, p’pone C/Europe debate until after Xmas.



H.C.	May put on Wales instead.

	Decided months since to pass time-table motion for Steel Bill before Xmas.

	Reluctant to propose another at present because of state of feeling in H/C.

	Moreover, I wd. now prefer to try their offer of gent’s agreement.  They mght well break it.  But I wd. like to see if we cd. make a deal with them.  Sanction wd. rest with us : to impose time-table if they don’t play the game.



D.S.	I agree with that idea.  Wd. help to keep pol. temperature down on Steel Bill.



P.M.	Very well.  



H.C.	Approach them before Xmas.  If I fail, can put the time-table thro’ as soon as we come back.





		4.	Defence Programme.



		Agreed, when P.M.’s statement made, contractors may be told.  No 		need to wait for N.A.T.O.

								[Exit D.S., B.H.



		5.	France : Political Situation.



A.E.	Good that P. shd. come here sometime.  He wanted to announce it at once to stave off pol. defeat.  Tricky because of C.E.C.  Have now agreed with Massigli tht. no announcemt. be made until we have bn. able to talk it over with him in Paris and settle what he is to see.

	Fr. pol. situation is v. shaky.  Schuman’s posn. however is improving.

	Mght be able to clinch Saar settlement while we are in Paris – prs. getting Adenauer over.





		6.	Czechoslovakia : Political Trials.



A.E.	In Hungary much apprehension lest their turn comes next.

	There may have bn. some “Tito” move in Czecho.

	Not v. unhelpful for us.  Tho’ B. public pay little attention to this sort of thing now.

						           [Enter H.G. &amp; Mackeson



		7.	Meat : Argentine Negotiations.



A.E.	Latest news is better.  They have come to meet us on all save dollars.



R.A.B.	We may now get £160 p.ton.  If we give way, we may lose $39 m. from reserves w’out any real surplus being earned by Argentine.

	I’m inclined to settle at this.



H.G.	At £160 we are doing as well as we expected.  And if we don’t settle before Xmas, we shall bring stocks down by end/53 to point as low as any reached by Socialists &amp; ration m’while at 1/8d.



R.A.B.	They wdn’t use whole of £20 m. credit in this way.  We cd. seek a settlement with limit of about $20-25 m. for loss of dollars.



A.E.	On whose Vote will credit be carried?



R.A.B.	Legn. will be needed to carry it save on F.O. Vote.



A.E.	Is there no way round?  F.O. have never done it : will be thought to be political : will be misunderstood abroad.  Solely commercial credit.



R.A.B.	Let us consider this again – betwn. Ty. &amp; F.O.



P.M.	We can’t have legn. : we do want meat : Ty. will pay.



							[Exit Mackeson.



		8.	Food : Decontrol of Sweets.



P.M.	Stock up first.



H.G.	They are 30% higher than at earlier attempt.  Shd. be fairly safe.

	But there must be some risk in it.

	Production is now about consumption.

	Price increase is inevitable anyway.

	Early in New Year or mid-summer are best moments.



Sw.	Do it after Xmas.



H.G.	Price increase will be about 2d. a lb.

	V. competitive trade.

	Prodn. now 6 oz. p.wk. cpd. with 4½ oz. on last attempt.

							                       [Exit H.G.



		9.	Middle East : Move of Headquarters.	       [Enter A.H. and de L.



P.M.	Don’t like approving this w’out scrutiny of members, or prejudging our w’drawal fr. Egypt.



A.E.	Ask only for agreemt. in principle tht. we shall have a H.Q. in Cyprus and agreemt. in prelim. works costing £500.000 over a period.  If we don’t start, it will take much longer to complete the move.



A.E.	On merits, Cyprus is better place for M/E. H.Q. now that Greece &amp; Turkey are in N.A.T.O.



	Turkey wd. like this.  Greeks wd. dislike it, and it would do them good to know we intend to remain in Cyprus.



P.M.	Don’t accept these figures.  Want to examine them.



A.E.	They aren’t final – can’t be when we don’t know what Forces we shall have there.

	We shan’t be able to move for 18 mos. after work begins.



P.M.	May we approve in principle, subject to detailed examination of plans.

	In principle we approve project of base in Cyprus.

	Agree that by New Year detailed examn. of projects for expense shall be approved.
