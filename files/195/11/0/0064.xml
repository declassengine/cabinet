C.C. 59 (53)					19th October, 1953



101.	    Paymaster General’s Mission.    								          [Enter A.L-B., J.T., P.B-H., J.B-C.

P.M.	Welcomed Cherwell back.



Ch.	Leakage before my arrival:  Press screams v. selling birth-right.  Cab. were stampeded – unwilling to offer any agreemt. before Election.

	In U.S. more satisf. talks on sharing atom. intelligence v R. results.

They fear McArthy.  Trying to find ways round McMahon Act.

We want specially analysis of debris : but to intercept it they say they wd. have to use informn. re own results, wh. wd. contravene McMahon Act.

	Eisenhower – opposed to idea of mtg. with R.  Wd. risk being kicked in the teeth.

	Will submit memo.





1.	    Trieste.



A.E.	Neither side accept our plan.  Think we shd. proceed quietly to hand over civil adminn. in Zone A to Italians, w’out w’drawg. our troops.  Believe both sides wd. acquiesce in that.

	Our démarche to Italians was good, but we didn’t say it publicly for fear it wd. weaken Ital. Govt.  Public therefore think our offer was more unfair to Yug. than it was.

	Must now tell U.S. tht. sooner or later we will have to make it public – for Pella is cheating, by saying Zone A as instalment.





1.	    Territorial Waters.



A.E.	Considering for 18 mos.  Sympathise with J.S. – wish we cd. help him more.  But all others concerned favour adherence to traditional method – and this is what U.S. want.  Base-line approach wd. make it diff. to protest v. Iceland &amp; similar tactics by others.

	If we take this line, say so quickly – to rally others behind us.



J.S.	Fishing interests in N. &amp; W. Scotland thght Hague Ct. decision wd. enable us to adopt base-line method.

	Rough words in H/C. when last raised.  Has gone on for 30 yrs

		My own constituency affected even more than most.

	Don’t see how I sell this policy in Scotland.



A.E.	Must say it wdn’t pay us.  Does balance of fishing advantage lie on side of old method.



T.D.	Yes.  Deep-sea fishermen wd. benefit, and they are majority.

If we go the other way, we do same as Iceland.  Danes are threatening same - &amp; cdn’t be argued out of it if we favoured base-line.



J.S.	Inshore men land 1/3rd. of white fish.



O.L.	Col. interests wd. be best served by adhering to traditional policy.



H.M.	Wait &amp; see wtr. we can get Iceland to the Hague if Dawson’s activities result in lifting of Grimsby ban.



A.E.	We shd. still want to argue in favour of old principle.



H.M.	But politically we shd. be in easier position.



A.E.	Ready to wait for 2 wks.

	{M’while prepare material for A.E.’s proposed approach.

	{No action w’out consultn. with J.S.

					[Exit A.L-B., J.T.

					[Enter A.H.

1.	    Egypt.



A.E.	i) 	Hankey is ill.  Robertson can take next mtg. with Cresswell.

	ii)	Uniform.  I prefer Para 5 (a) – on occasion, vice occasionally. They vice personnel.



Sal.	Improvement.  “when ordered” vice “on occasion.”



A.H.	Working dress in winter is battle-dress.  Suggest : “E. Govt. accepts tht on formal occasions they appropte. uniform may be worn.”  Implicn. of a diffce. betwn. Service uniform &amp; working dress is unsound.



H.M.	Cairo draft avoids issues of principle.  Better to leave some ambiguity.



H.M.	Civilian clothes  plain clothes.



			Agreed : as in my copy of Cairo. Tel 1469.



Sal.	Killearn’s P.Q. re hanging of Egyptian, Sambri, (?) who worked for us.



A.E.	We made repns.  Hankey deprecates protest re Sabri himself, and makg. it only in genl. terms.  See telegrams.

					[Exit A.H., P.B-H.



1.	    Korea.



A.E.	Reading wd. represent us.

	Wd. need to discuss these “principles” with U.S.



			Approved.

1.	    Decontrol of Food.



Ll.G.	As in memo.

	Wd. not affect discussions with farmers.



W.M.	Regret it because will be seen to involve removal of subsidies.  But inevitable now farmers know.

	Make it clear i) no effect in near future ii) effect eventually can’t be forecast now.



B-C.	Tell farmers first because we said there wd. be no public statement.



T.D.	RAB. may want to review decision &amp; told farmers so if farmers don’t want marketg boards.  Enough to tell food trades as much as farmers have bn. told.



Ll.G.	E.P.C. decn. was on merits – not dependant on farmers’ attitude.



H.C.	But it wd. upset farmers if you announced it now.

	Tell food trades it is likely.  No public announcement.



W.	Surely we shall decontrol, whatever farmers say.



Ll.G.	This cd. be done w’out reference to farmers.



P.M.	Tell food trades in confidence, but delay public announcement until R.A.B. returns.





1.	    Mental Patients.

					[Enter I. McL.

			Memo approved.

					[Exit I. McL.

					[Enter J.F.



1.	    “No – new preference” Rule : G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Arguing for waiver.  May get it.  If I don’t, what do we do?

	Courses open :   i) legn. to raise duties v. Comm. Wdn’t pass

				ii) revive use of quotas.  Wd. be unpopular &amp; contrary 

				to G.A.T.T.

				iii) raise tariffs.  Wd. breach G.A.T.T. only if there are 

				Comm. goods &amp; v. technical.

	Favour iii).  U.S. are in breach of G.A.T.T. on another article : not at       

				all technical.

	Hope it may not come to that.



Ch.	We are using quotas now.  Why not go on until GATT. is reviewed in 18 mos.



P.T.	Pol. uproar from farmers.



A.E.	Had hoped my para. 4 wd. do.  Individual waivers.

See we wd. have to argue every case.  But likely to get away with it more easily.



P.T.	They won’t give us individual waivers.  Turned it down a month ago before mtg. began.

	Lifting quota restns. will help Europeans.



H.M.	Strong Tory feeling v. G.A.T.T. as such.  That is the point.



P.T.	That is my diffy.  Must be able to show some flexibility or else can’t defend G.A.T.T. at all.



H.M.	Say we are considering w’drawing fr. G.A.T.T.  But shd. have to know wtr we wd. lose too much by that.



A.E.	Might be much more serious. 



Ch. 	Wd. lose far more than we gain.



P.T.	Wd. be.  My plan wd. involve only techn. breach &amp; wdn’t affect trade of any country.



P.M.	Best to move slightly in direction of protection – and don’t worry too much over logic or old Tariff/Free Trade quarrel.



A.E.	Don’t like going to the court &amp; then announcg. we propose to break the law despite the decision.



P.T.	May I have it clear tht. answer is to put tariffs on coniferous &amp; stall on Commonwealth appln.  Muff the latter.



			Half Agreed : If we don’t get waiver, we shall solve

	                       problem by raising tariffs.  Will consider how

                                we phrase it, in consultn. with A.E.

		F.O. and B/T. to consult, with Ty. intervening.



H.M.	Let’s think it over further.  And discuss, particularly how do we present case for raising tariffs.





1.	    Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	A. &amp; N.Z. consulted on new compromise.  A. won’t support it.

	N.Z. doesn’t like it.

	Wdn’t do to part with A. on this.

       	Must go back &amp; abstain fr. voting – as Cab. originally agreed.



A.E.	Compromise invented to meet our diffces.  No objns. of substance to it.

We shall make diffies. for ourselves if we reject it.

	Will A. stick to their line.  U.S. are bringing v. strong pressure on them. Sw. telegraphed tht. A. mght agree so long as J. had no rights to vote.

	Presumably if A. ratted, we wd. accept compromise.



L.P.S.	Sw. tel. isn’t v. clear.

	I suggest we go back to M. and be sure what he really means.



P.T.	If A. change their mind, we can re-consider.

	We can keep our posn. open.

	But want to tell our Delegn. to abstain – to stand with A.



A.E.	Wd. affect many current negotiations with Japan.



		L.P.S. Further message to Menzies ongoing advantages of

		           	compromise – tho’ saying tht., if in the end, they abstain, we will abstain too.



			Agreed – as at x/.
