C.C. 30 (53)					5th May, 1953



1.	Indo-China.

					[Enter B-H., S.Ll., F.H.

P.M.	Decns. of Def. Cttee. not to afford help.

	Now told 50 transport aircraft are held here v. need for Berlin air-lift.



Al.	That wd. be a call on civil aircraft : &amp; wd. be needed in emergency for lifting troops to Sudan, Songkhla or Egypt.



S.Ll.	Believe tht. in addn. there are some in moth-ball.



Al.	Shd. hve to verify they aren’t needed for our mil. purposes.

M/State to pursue with [M/Def. and] S of S. for Air.



S.Ll.	M’while told tht. French are standing down their own aircraft.  Want to be sure they aren’t trying merely to draw us in.  Will test that aspect too.





1.	Parliament.

3)	

H.C.	Business for next week.  F.Aff. P.M. Monday  M/S Tuesd : 2nd speech (opening).  Nutting wind up.



F.H.    	(a.) Spelling Bill  - can’t hope to defeat it.  May I consider a compromise.



P.M.	Don’t palter with the evil thing.



B-H.	Can’t guarantee to defeat 3rd Rdg.  Don’t want H/L. to throw it out.



P.M.	Why not?  This is a thing H/L. cd. do w’out embarrassment.



B-H.	WD. prefer a compromise tht. costs us nothing i.e. an assurance tht. research may continue.



F.H.	Explained suggested assurance re research.

	Bad in principle to legislate requiring Minister to hold a particular enquiry.



S.W.	Awkward at present for H/L. to flout H/C. – tactics qua constitutl. position.



P.M.	Are H/L. never to correct H/C.?

	Will Pitman w’draw Bill on this sort of assurance?



F.H.	Almost certainly.



P.M.	Are you sure the others supporting the Bill wd. accept its w’drawal.

B.H.	Yes – all except Socialists supportg. it to embarrass us.



Ch.	Even if that happened, it wd. be easier for H/L. to throw it out.



H.C.	Yes -  support compromise course.



			Agreed:  Subject to comfirmn. to P.M. tht. Pitman agrees.



	(b) Press Council Bill.



M.F.	V. awkward if this comes on as result of (a).

	We have agreed to vol. Council – can’t now allow statutory one to be imposed.  Adjourned debate on 2nd Rdg.



B.H.	At worst, we cd. kill it in Cttee.

	Or closure if less than 100 on other side.  Get our chaps to spk.



			                                                  [Exit F.H.

			                                                  [Enter P.M.G., Att. G., de L.



1.	Television.

4)	

P.M.	Cttee to study practical long-term plan.

	R.A.B. (Chair):  M-F.: W.: J.S.: P.M.G. L.P.S.



W.	V. small financial commitment.  If we don’t move quickly the areas not served will make trouble.  No sufft. fin. reason to deny them.

	If we delay B.B.C. development, we delay commercial v. seriously.

	No pol. trouble deciding tht. whole country wants B.B.C. television.



P.M.G.	Party want us also to implement promise re commercial.

	If we don’t decide by July, we shall in effect prevent sponsored p’mmes before Election.  Need for quick decision.



S.W.	Is it not a more limited ques.



R.A.B.	When we sanction B.B.C. stations, we are into sponsored.  We cd. do first w’out real trouble.  Diffy. is to know what we do about 2nd.

	Can Cttee. meet once &amp; submit quick report.



			Agreed:  Cttee. as opposite.



J.S.	Denial of B.B.C. p’mme has bn. based on shortage of material.  If we announce soon the go-ahead, gt. row in Scotland who were denied facilities to see Coronn.  Can’t P.M.G. even now boost television in these Sc. areas.



P.M.G.	Went to Aberdeen : they aren’t interested in tempy. services for Coronn. Want permanent facilities as soon as they can get it.

	I of M. will discuss with M.F.



			                                                  [Enter J.T., A.H., Solr. Genl.

			Agreed.                                     [Exit J.T., A.H., Solr. Genl.





1.	Judges Salaries.

6)	

R.A.B.	a) Do we try to legislate this Session?  If we can’t because time-table we shd. at least make it clear tht. we mean to go on with improvemt. of remuneration.



W.M.	Engin. Claim : tussle likely to be in July.



R.A.B.	b) Method.  I cd. circulate a scheme, with Sim.



P.M.	Wd. it not be better to allow engineers’ claim to get settled first.



W.M.	Bad time to do it, if we cd. p’pone until early next session.



Sim.	Won’t there be another wage claim then?



H.C.	Doubt if we cd. do it before end/July.

	Don’t want to do it at time wh. wd. be embarrassing to Judges.



Sim.	Will there be much diffce. fr. that angle betwn. July &amp; Nov.



H.C.	No:  but want to be sure we cd. get it thro’ by end/session.



Sim.	Cd. we decide now wtr. we depart fr. our chosen method? – in view of back-bench criticism.



R.A.B.	Criticism is wider than that.  Genl. preference for salary increase.



P.M.	Summd. R.A.B.’s new plan.

	Wd. have preferred to adhere to original plan.



					[Exit W. &amp; Alex.



Ch.	More logical basis wd. be to make a lower salary wholly tax-free.



R.A.B.	Shd. Sim. see Executive of 1922 Cttee. – and then, with some other Minister, to whole Cttee.



P.M.	Yes.

R.A.B.	Second stage later, if we are to defer until autumn.



			Agreed:  {Sim. to put his views (principle &amp; method) to Ex. 

			               {Cttee. of 1922.  No hope of legn. to be held out 

			               {before autumn.



R.A.B.           |	We shd. have to announce our plan in July, even if Bill doesn’t come

                  X |		until autumn.



Sim.	We shd. take opportunity, if it’s to be salary increase, of removg. some of disparity betw. E. &amp; Sc. Judges. – by giving £3,000 to all.



P.M.	Line with ’22 Cttee. : resolved to go fwd. with principle : ready to consider their views on method.  Don’t exclude £3.500 wholly tax-free.



W.M.	Consider X| later, in light of wage claim situation.



H.M.	If we can’t have Bill until autumn, not sure statement wd. be wise or necessary.





1.	Parliament:  Salaries of M.P.’s.

7)	

P.M.	Letter recd. from H.M.  Have we decided to appoint Cttee?

	I prefer to explore less work (procedure) vice more pay.

	For bitter Tory prejudice will be shown v. raising M.P.’s salaries.

Am commd. to consult 1922 Cttee.

Shd. we not raise it there, in assocn. with discn. of procedure (pairing etc.)  Might even sweeten it with allowances etc.,

	Propose to hint this in corrce. with H.M. – pairing, proxy etc.,



H.C.	There is Cttee. about to begin on amenities at W’minster.  May give some help.



R.A.B.	Wd. prefer Opposn. to start this up on Supply Day.



M/F/	Free postage.  Also reducg. burden e.g. pairing.



B.H.	Avoid raising pairing in 1922 Cttee. : our chaps will get out of control.  Must keep that to usual channels, or Whips won’t be able to work.

					[Exit B-H.

					[Enter D.S.

1.	Atomic Energy:  External Policy.

8)	

P.M.	Wd. prefer to omit reference to being unable to count on full co-opn with U.S.



Ch.	Don’t want A. to think it wd. be easy for them to make a private deal with U.S.



S.W.	Say “neither of us can count at present time on …”



			Agreed.



P.M.	Was impressed (Jan) by Eisenhower’s strong sympathy with our case. 



Ch.  	Congress, however, is still v. hostile. Truman promised but couldn’t perform.

					[Exit D.S.

					[Enter O.P.

1.	Provision for Old Age.

9)	

R.A.B.	Urgent.  Can cover Scotland.

	Choose a Chairman.  Then M/L. shd. try to rope in T.U.C.



W.M.	Not  hopeless.  Cttee. under Watkinson now sitting : say in announcement tht. new Cttee. will take their work into a/c.



			Agreed : P.M. to be consulted re Chairman.





1.	East/West Trade.  Graybex Ltd.

10)	

P.T.	Evce. warrantg. prosecn. of Draytex LtD. for evasion of export control – selling ball-bearings to Soviet.  Drayson M.P. was &amp; is a director.

Haven’t proceeded ever v. all directors personally &amp; wdn’t do so now.

	Wd. intend therefore to proceed v. firm &amp;one director whose complicity can be proved.  But Grayson’s name wd. be mentioned by counsel in opening – in ordinary course.



P.M.	Is it suff. serious for procdgs?



P.T.	Yes – on merits &amp; also because at least one foreign Govt. is aware of it.



Att.G.	I have advised P.T. to obtain counsel’s opinion to confirm my view tht. it wd. be correct not to join Drayson with procdgs., because he was not actively concerned with this side of the business.  Don’t want that to rest on my advice alone.
