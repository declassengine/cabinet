C.C. 6(53)							3rd February, 1953



		1.	Formosa.					[Enter J.P.L.T.



A.E.	Circulated draft of statement.

	Must say something.  For Dulles may argue tht. P.M. was consulted in N. York.



	“Concern” is not too strong a word.

	Design to quieten public opinion here, while avoiding offence to U.S.

	Effect of attack on mainland by Chiang – on Sino-Soviet Treaty.



		Statement approved, with minor amendments.





		2.	Electoral Reform.



P.M.	Memo. supplied by R.A.B. – to me &amp; L.P.S. – amountg. to polite negative, promising to weigh arguments w’out commitmt.

	I had thght P.R. in larger cities might be useful.  But am disheartened by extent to wh. P.R. in any form has brght Parly. Govt. into disrepute – lack of stable Govt. eg. in France.  This is not favourable moment for experiment.



H.C.	Agree : Tories wdn’t look at it.



P.M.	Alternative vote &amp; 2nd ballot.  I’m not so much opposed to 2nd of these.

	But involves 2nd election after delay.

	Alternve. vote is “child of folly &amp; the father of fraud”.



R.A.B.	Single transferable vote in big cities may have to be considered one day.

	For big transference of popn. fr. cities into country will alter balance of voting in dormitory areas.  But no action now.

								[Enter C.N.S.



		3.	Falkland Islands.



P.M.	Risk of acting on narrow margin.



C.N.S.	Cruiser (Superb) will be there by 14/2. (Falkland 1st)  17/2 Deception.



O.L.	Will consider wthr. that delay can be accepted.  But can’t hang on for long.



Al.	You will have to wait for her marines – w’out wh. you can’t run effective landing-party.



P.M.	Speed up the cruiser &amp; wait for her.  Let her be there in 14 days.



C.N.S.	Stay as planned in Salvador &amp; steam faster thereafter.



Sim.	Wd. have bn. easier in ’47.  Since then Argentines have establd. base in Deception Island.  Are you going to move them too?



W.Sc.	Better be right than consistent.  This is an affront &amp; shd. be dealt with as such.    We cd. ignore the other better if we bounced this one.

	Don’t take them to Falkland Islands.



Sim.	We claim whole of Deceptn Island?



O.L.	Yes : &amp; shd. probly. win in Int. Court.



A.E.	Wd. prefer to treat Chileans &amp; Argentines similarly.  And don’t want to take them to Montevideo : prefer to dump them in another of their bases.   



P.M. 	Don’t like last propos.



		Agreed :	(Superb to arrive in 14 days.

				(Plan appd. in principle.  Sim. O.L. A.E. repves. 			&amp; M/D. to consider refinements : esp. 				destination.

							[Exit J.P.L.T.  C.N.S.



		4.	Commonwealth Economic Conference.



A.E.	Arrangements for visit must await a word with Dulles.



P.M.	They will need time to digest this memo.



R.A.B.	Yes : 10/14 days before we arrive.

	Dulles was warned tht. French &amp; Italians wd. protest to him.



A.E.	We must go, because of Comm. partners and daffy. of contain. Europe, and must go before Budget season sets in.



O.L.	Memo. : P.5.  Moves a long way fr. earlier concept. of floating rate.

	Also Para. 28. wraps it up pretty much.



R.A.B.	Good chance of U.S. co-open. (cf. Ike’s statement y’day).

	E.P.U. will be diff : shall have to extend it temporarily.

	Ike favourable to “Trade not Aid”.



Ch.	Thought p.5. &amp; Para. 28 was intentional because of Indian objn.



O.L.	The principle was accepted at C.E.C.  We shd. be more bold on it in memo.



R.A.B.	No intention to fluff this : will look at these passages again.

		Memo.  approved, subject to review of p.5 (flexible rate).



P.T.	Add. to Para. 8.  More than “modification”.  Agreed : “some changes in”.  Alternative to E.P.U. : we needn’t say we have firm belief : we haven’t a plan yet.    “Aim” vice “firm belief”.  Agreed.

	O.L. will send in some drafting amendments.





		5.	House of Lords Reform.



P.M.	Lord Shepherd has since seen Sw.  Suggd. we see C.R.A. &amp; H.M. before invites. sent.  I’m opposed to that : for they will decline, and stymie our gesture.  They wd. press at least for p’ponement until late in Parlt. &amp; stultify our declared policy.



A.E.	Will be diff. to man the Cttee. if it comes off.  Was bad enough on last occasion, in Opposn.



Sw.	No hurry to start mtgs, – only to issue invitns.



						[Enter H.G., T.D., A.S., McL.

		6.	Supply Expenditure.



P.M.	Shd. we not do more in cuts?  Industry needs relief.



R.A.B.	Cdn’t do it, save on Health, Education, Housing or Defence.

	External posn. improved.  Reserves £2.000M. (or $).  But that, and our deflationary policy, has affected our internal revenue posn.  Customs &amp; inl. revenue returns have fallen.  Shan’t get surplus we had planned.

	But deflation relieves us of need to budget for surplus.

	Can’t slash much more expendre. in a hurry.  Must, however, plan policy for next year.  Thus – enquiry on defence, on health service, and my own scrutiny of education : we shall be better able to make a dent in this for ’54.



P.M.	Want to see tax relief for profits ploughed back into industry.



P.T.	Industry can’t sustain present level of publ. expre.  If we attempt to go on, we shall fail in our other objects (eg. convertibility, exports, liberalisation) because they depend on industry’s competitive capacity.

	Agree we can’t do much before April.  But ask for Cttee. of Ministers to study long-term means of securing real redn. in expenditure.



P.M.	Cttee.	(R.A.B., L.P.S., Sw., Cherwell, P.T., M/F. and J. Stuart

	   x/.	(to examine these short-term proposals, and to examine

		(long-term issues as far as can be done at present.



T.D.	Para. 9. assumes under-recoupment at review.  That wd. undermine production.  In certain commodities, yes – but not overall.



A.S.	Cut in strategic materials p’mme gives me gt. anxiety.

	Wanted £33M.  Economy in this is less valuable than any – not inflationary : doesn’t weaken our reserves.



Ch.	Support P.T. on long term.  37%  21% pre war 8% before 1914

	propn. of national income wh. is spent by the State.



R.A.BN.	A substantial cut in public expre. will result in unemployment.



P.M.	Shall we publish worst picture in Estimates?



R.A.B.	Favour publishing all save sugar &amp; meat.



H.G.	Ceiling £250.  If estimates are publd. to bring it down, you will because of cereals imply tht. ceiling is coming below £200.

	I wd. sooner have it all p’poned to Budget.



T.D.	So would I.  Otherwise we appear to pre-judge issue before annual review.



Sw.	Prefer to keep all food items until full picture can be presented in Budget.



McL.	Prescriptns. cdn’t wait until then.  Planned to come in on 1/3.



R.A.B.	Won’t be compensatg. reliefs this time.

							[Exit T.D., H.G., A.S.



		7.	National Health Service.



McL.	Want this – tho’ not optimistic re results.

	Wd. like Health Ministers, not Ty, to announce.



J.S.	They may recommend more expre., not less.  But still, favour risking it.



P.T.	Cd. they recommend a charge?



McL.	Yes – or block grant, wh. teaching hospitals favour.



McL.	Prescrip’n. charge : interim method is hold posn. m’while.



J.S.	Must stop abuse : but sometimes 2 prescriptns. are needed for one disease – can’t that be a single charge?



		Approved : Let Cabinet see list of names and revised t. of r.



		[R.A.B.  Hetherington envisaged as Chairman.

		[T. of r.  Omit words “having regard [- to the other claims on the 	national economy”.

							[Exit McL.







		8.	Sudan.



A.E.	Produced draft tel. to Cairo.  We are most vulnerable on Sudanisation : &amp; I therefore offer tht. internatl. commn. shd. decide wthr. B. offls. remain for more than 3 years.  / This shd. bring negotns. to a head.  Likely there will be a break.
