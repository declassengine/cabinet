C.C. 12(53)							17th February, 1953



		(2.	Egypt : Defence Negotiations.	[Enter 3 Service Ministers

		(1.	Sudan.



A.E.	Tel. 309 from Cairo.  But statement issued is more downright.  Waterhouse is demanding P. Notice Ques.  Can only repeat tht. independent country can do what it likes – incldg. any form of assocn. with any foreign State.



P.M.	Party troubles : Low’s cartoon in M. Guardian.





	 	2.	Egypt : Defence Negotiations.



O.L.	Negotiations : insist on our terms.



M.F.	Must get it clear tht. M.E.D.O. is real, not paper, before we w’draw.  We cd. then hold pol. situation here : not otherwise.



L.	Canal : world is used to having Br. protn. there : tho’ maritime countries shd. contribute.  Mustn’t w’draw our protn. before substitute is available.  Fr. personnel wd. not stay there w’out it. &amp; Fr. provide large propn. of the technical staff.



Ch.	Take a strong line. They have renounced Treaty : let them suggest an alternative.  Tho’ if we can’t hold base w’out E. labour ….  Show of firmness mght serve as it did over Sudan.



Sw.	Sudan.  Reactions fr. A. &amp; N.Z. are wholly favourable to Agreemt.

	Right to join Comm : we shd. insist upon that, as A.E. did.



H.C.	Endorse A.E.’s paper on Egypt.  What part wd. U.S. take?  Wd. Caffery have same negotiating status as Stevenson.



R.A.B.	Turns on a) – f) in C.17.

	b) is most important.  Case B. wdn’t give us certainty of re-entry, which is vital to us, strategically &amp; politically.

	d) All depends on reality of M.E.D.O. &amp; full U.S. support for that.

	Will Tories accept it as imaginative alternative to Disraeli’s purchase of the shares.  If N. won’t play on that, we shd. not be hurried.  Unilateral plan with E. wdn’t get us thro’.



P.T.	Endorse R.A.B.’s remark.

	Annex B. – delay U.S. supply of arms until progress made in talks.



W.M.	Para. 6 – “package” plan.  That is essential.  Esp. b) and d).

	Can’t look at a) without those.

	Timing therefore is v. important.  And in present uncertainty we shd. not go beyond Case A.  The 5.000 men being uniformed &amp; with personal arms.



Al.	Sudan soln. was best attainable.  Later E. re-actions on independence indicate E. dishonest view of agreemt.  This means care on defence ques.

	Agree with R.A.B.  Tell N. we are ready to discuss a) on condn.  of b) Case A. and d) with E. contn. to M.E.D.O.  W’out those guarantees refuse to negotiate.



Sim.	Support R.A.B.’s views.



P.M.	C.17 awaits my endorsement.

	Are a) – f) interdependent?



A.E.	Slim says his criticism of Case A. is tht. the nos. are unnecessarily large for purpose in view – they total nearly the 10,000 allowed under Treaty.

	Jordan.  Have indicated they wd. like our Armoured Brigade there permanently.  Tel. 92 from Amman.



P.M.	Paper No.2.  Concentn. of power round Israel – will be controversial.



A.E.	We and U.S. would never attack Israel.  They wdn’t mind M.E.D.O.



P.M.	If it’s a package, we cd. go fwd. &amp; see how it goes.  But this is minimum &amp; not to be whittled away. Case A. is least we can accept.  Must be joint Anglo-U.S. approach.  First thing is to make it clear to U.S. tht. we are at end of tether.  Wd. wish first to telegraph privately to Ike &amp; verify tht. he will go in with us whole-heartedly on this.



	Are Stevenson and Caffery big enough to handle this big &amp; military issue?  I thght Slim wd. be better.  Saw him last pm. – gave him C.17.  Wd. involve p’poning his arrival in Austr. : but they have an interest in this &amp; might agree.



	I wd. feel greater confidence if he handled it.  He stood up to Farouk.  A.E. does not consider Slim’s previous contacts there wd. disqualify him.  Then prs. we cd. ask Ike to send military figure also, to match Slim.  If they agreed and nominated Bedell Smith, Bradley or even Ridgway, the appearance &amp; weight of influence on N. wd. be impressive.  We mght then be better able to make some small concessions.

	If Cab. approves, I will send message to Ike.  Sw. must seek permission of Austr. Govt.



Sw.	Support this plan.  P.M. to Menzies personal.



A.E.	Am enthusiastic for this.  A big Anglo-U.S. heave will be needed to get Case A.  Stevenson has asked for mil. help.

	I don’t like Caffery.

	Seen Slim this am.  He will do what he is asked.  But timetable –

	Due to be sworn in 27/3 :	A. Parlt. Adjourns on 26/3.  Was to sail on Tuesday.  Who will act until he arrives?  Cd. he know to-day?  Slim says Bedell wd. be better than Bradley.



P.M.	Order :	  i) Telegram to Menzies.

		  ii) Telegram to Ike : not waiting on

		  i) or saying Slim for certain.



P.M.	I am prepared to make C.17 (package) as counter proposals to

                  *	N.’s initial proposals in negotiation.



	A.E. cd. clinch an Anglo-U.S. plan on arrival in W’ton.

	M’while don’t let N. hustle us.  He can unfold his proposals, if he must start talks.  We are in position of strength &amp; can resist any forceful attempt to hustle us out.



	Fight for “package” with A. as our irreducible aim.



	Must have 2/3 weeks to settle it all with U.S.

							         [Enter Solr. Genl.



		3.	Army &amp; Air Force Acts : Mutiny.



P.M.	Why bring this up?



A.H.	We didn’t.  H/C. insisted on Select Cttee. to re-write the Acts.  And this point has now arisen.



	Service Depts. have considered posn.  Believe these small reductions in death penalty cd. be accepted.



M.B.	Sel. Cttee. have not yet reached any concln.



A.H.	They want our views.



O.L.	This is an improvement.  Wd. mean tht. more people wd. be shot because it wd. give fewer degrees of mutiny than existg. law, under which too many people escape.



M.B.	Para.5(2) wd. make it v. diff to get a conviction because of “intent”.



O.L.	Can rely on 5(1).



Sim.	Shdn’t L.O.’s be given opportunity to discuss with Service Ministers.



P.M.	Brilliant suggn..  So proceed.

Sw.	Comm. Govts will need to be



							[Exit Serv. Ministers.

		4.	Supplementary Estimates.		 Solr. Genl.



R.A.B.	Not all reprehensible.

	But one group - £6.5 M. wh. makes a bad impn.

	But asked for £22 M. extra by M/F. – intolerable.

	Want only to get on record need for more accurate estimating wherever possible.



	Will communicate with Ministers on this re next year.



		Took note.

	



		5.	M. Sanders and Mee Leng.



P.M.	…..  How else bring pressure on Hungary?  



A.E. 	Can do no more : have stopped all trade.  If we have to wait 4 months for appeal it will be too late.



		Wait until appeal appln. result is known.



							[Exit A.E.

		6.	Coronation : Homage.



Sim.	At Coronation Cttee. y’day (self in Chair) C.R.A. suggested tht. Leader of H/C. shd. join in Homage.  I suggd. appointmt. of Cttee. to consider and report.



Sw.	Will raise v. gt. diffies. in all Comm. countries – whose Speakers wd. equally need to be given same opportunity.

	Have a draft telegram, wh. Shows the diffies.

		Circulate this for Thursday’s Cabinet.



R.A.B.	Labour spokesmen were all in favour.

	Shd. be something : e.g. Speaker shd. make a bow.  cf. Prayer Book recognition of Parliament.





		7.	Floods.



		(i)	Drafts of Govt. Motions.



M.F.	Intended to appoint Cttee. to examine long-range problem.

	This has occurred 3 times in 1.000 yrs : must be careful to see how far we shd. go.



Sw.	H/L. shd. pass the 1st Motion.

M.F.	Will consult Opposition before tabling these.



P.M.	Names.  I will put mine to 1st Motion.



		(ii)	Financial Assistance.



R.A.B.	L. Mayors’ Fund is not going well.  But Eve is now to come in to run it.  If it becomes effective, I wd. like to put compensation ques  (except farming) to it.  Then I wd. be ready to give £1M.



M.F.	1947 – total £3M. includg. £1M fr. Ty.

	No estimate yet of total damage.  Hollands’ estimate is £100M. – indicates extent of damage.



P.M.	Don’t hurry to name Govt. contn.



H.M.	Don’t yet know amount uncovered by insurance – esp. by smaller people.



M.F.	Can’t get thro’ debate w’out being able (i) to show tht. Fund is efficient or (ii) to name Govt. contribution.



R.A.B.	Ty. to consider Departmentally what shd. be done by Govt. to relieve agriculture.



		(iii)	Lynmouth Fund.



M.F.	Lynmouth Fund has ½ m. unused.  Can’t legally be used for floods.  Suggest we take it over for this purpose – by legn..



Sim.	Usual opposn..  - from people who gave £10 because parents lived in Lynmouth.



P.M.	Also people of Lynmouth wdn’t mind sharing it out.



		Leave this for further thought.
