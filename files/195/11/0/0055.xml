C.C. 48(53).				10th August, 1953.



	1.	Pakistan.            [Enter  A.H., de L., Home, ALB., S.Ll., Digby.



Sw.	Drew attention to telegrams re Republic.  P.M. wishes to re-inforce by

		personal message.  Read text.



R.A.B.	P.M. merely wished Cab. to know – not to approve.



			Agreed : No comment or objn.





	2.	Four-Power Meeting.



Sal.	Soviet reply – unhelpful : shows no change of heart.  cf. to-day’s

		Herald.  Main object : drive wedges.

	But wd. play into their hands to crab talks.  Aim : to bring them

		on, with open agenda : no advance commitmts.

	Must agree timing &amp; content of reply with U.S. &amp; France.

	U.S. &amp; Fr. have got prelimy. re-actions in before we cd.  Fr. are in line

		with ours.  U.S. is surprising – ignores early part of note &amp;

		suggests bland acceptance.  More like Ike than State Dpt.

		China &amp; no agenda surely unacceptable to U.S.  From talks with

		Holmes I gather tht. they will stress fact tht. many subjects

		already under discn. elsewhere &amp; G. is therefore important first

		item for a F. Power Mtg.

	Discussed with P.M. on Saty.  He thinks we shd. not take initiative in

		suggesting lines of reply.  Let U.S. make the running.  Our

		message to W’ton shd. be interrogatory.  Draft sent round earlier

		to-day.  P.M. thinks even that is too dogmatic.  Have therefore

		produced second draft.  Have also asked Holmes to report tht. we

		wd. welcome D.’s personal views – reservg. our right to 

		comment.

	Timing : drafting Cttee. will be needed on detail.  Offls. in Paris in

		Aug. (U.S. suggn.)  I favour accepting that.  P’pone despatch of

		reply until after G. elections.  Sov. reply &amp; Mal. speech likely to

		be unpopular in G.



R.A.B.	Read P.M.’s Minute M263/53.

	Since then P.M. knows of revised draft.  He wants to consider it with

		Cabinet’s advice this p.m.

	P.M. also inclined to limit this telegram to W’ton only – not Paris.



Sal.	We can send to W’ton only if we send it before we get D. views – tho’

		we shd. have to let Fr. know of it afterwards.

	But Cab. may prefer to send nothing at this stage.



Ch.	Surely D. will take some of these points.  Better say nothing.



H.M.	Agree on timing.  Leave ill alone : R. reply is offensive to G., east

		&amp; west.

	Agree also our aim – to have mtg. or leave failure to get it with R.

		Para. 3.  Add, after acceptance, of a mtg. of the 4 For. Ministers.

		We don’t want to accept inclusion of China.

	Then go on : how phrase our acceptance w’out appearing by silence

		to accept implications of Soviet note.  That is a separate ques – 

		of framing terms of our reply.

	On N.A.T.O. &amp; bases:  put it in U.S. mind tht. R. has a diffy over

		bases &amp; satellites.



Sw.	Favour despatch of § 1-3:  delay remainder until we know 

		D.’s views.



Sal.	Nervous of sending 1-3 alone:  may suggest we see no diffies.

	Perhaps an expanded para. 2 mght go : &amp; remainder be w’held

		until D.’s views.  Viz:  “Await D.’s views.  M’while there

		is one point we wd. wish to make on timing ………”



H.M.	Work in first part of 3 – to indicate tht. we do want the mtg.



Sal :	Send only paras. 2 and 3 as amended in discussion, subject

			to approval of P.M.		Agreed.





	3.	Suez Canal.



Sal.	As in memo.  Recommns. as in para. 7.

	This doesn’t exclude raising this in defence negotns.  Tho’ I shd.

		be loth to do that.

	Make one more attempt with U.S.



Sw.	Discussed at P.M.M.  But wd. prefer to confine informn. at this

		stage to old Doms.  Tell new Doms. only when we are about to

		make the approach to E.



L.	Cd. we not bring this into defence argument.



Al.	Base is not needed solely for Canal.  And wd. complicate our def.

		negotns.



Sal.	If we claim tht. base is necessary for Canal, we shall imply tht. we 

		must stay for ever.



A.H.	Agree – other Serv. Ministers also agreed.



L.B.	May have to be brght in later.



Sal.	We can’t take the line tht. until we get satisfy. agreemt. on Canal 

		our troops must stay in E.



			Memo. approved.		[Exit  A.L.B.

	



4.	New Hebrides.



O.L.	All courses are unsatisfy.



			Memo. approved.





	5.	Israel.



Sal.	Def. Cttee. wanted this tel. drafted.

	Doubts about some points.  E.g. para. 4, 5 and 7(a).

	Disposed to p’pone this until Cairo talks get a little clearer.



Al.	C.O.S. want to build up Israelis.  But on timing, I agree tht. this

		is not the moment to go ahead with it.



R.A.B.	Ty. have always insisted tht. U.S. wd. have to pay.



			Agreed :  Defer for time being.

			                Further reference to Cabinet before it goes.

			                R.A.B. will inform P.M.





	6.	Korea.



RAB.	Warning decln.  Herald to-day imputes bad faith in not disclosing

		this to Parlt.

	Cab. decided tht. Oppn. leaders shd. be told.



Sal.	They were told.  And made no complaint re procedure followed.

		Tho’ H.M. expd. distaste for substance.



RAB.	F.O. cd. give some guidance to rest of Press.



Sal.	We cd. give history : &amp; cd. say Opposn. were told in confidence. 





	7.	Civil Defence : Man Power.



W.M.		i)	High level appeal.  We think inappropriate.

		ii)	Compuls. regn.         ..      ..    impracticable.

		iii)	Transfer of N.S. men not requd. by R.A.F. &amp; not called

		                  up for reserve training.

	iii) is only starter.  And it’s difficult.  Legn. wd. be needed.

		Def. Ministers oppose this – wd. increase diffies. of their 

		Reservists Bill.  Shd. we leave it until that Bill is thro’ –

		even tho’ that wd. defer mtg. this real need.  Or are there

		other expedients – e.g. wtr. all N.S. men shdn’t have C.D.

	x/	training during their 2 years.



M.F.	This means – nothg. can be done.

	Those who have volunteered are for part-time service only.

		300,000 will be needed full-time.

	Can we do nothing?

	Recognise diffies. (para. 6).  But can we ask M/L. Cttee. to consider

		method of compulsion after ’54 for a smaller no.



R.A.B.	Repeated x/.  Wd. mean that great many people wd. have had some 

		training.  And may be greatest role of Forces in 1st. phase.



A.H.	Wd. be diff. for us:  give only 10 weeks training now before despatch

		abroad.  Declining man-power.



de L.	WD. prefer to consider in light of H.D.C. report.

	Dislike (iii).



D.	R.N. take only 4.000 p.a.  And cdn’t train in C.D.



Al.	Ready to examine x/.



			Agreed:   Examine x/. – M/Def.

			                H.O. to raise genl. ques of C.D. later.

					            [Exit  S.Ll.



	8.	B.W. Trials.



D.S.	Def. Cttee. asked me to avoid Bahamas, if possible.

	Have re-considered.  Clear it wd. take v. much longer in Hebrides.

	This is a field in wh. we have a technical lead as cpd. with U.S.  It is

		worth retaining that.  If we don’t keep ahead of them, it will be

		hardly worthwhile to go on with it at all.

	Can adopt safeguards wh. shd. eliminate risk of unfortunate incident.

		There is in fact v. little shipping in the area.



O.L.	The favourable condns. for b.w. are just what attracts tourists.

	Pity M/S. can’t find any other place in whole world.



Sw.	Can’t hope to escape publicity.



Ch.	Cd. we join with U.S. &amp; do trials where they do theirs.



D.S.	We tried that – w’out success.



RAB.	Waste of time &amp; money in Hebrides.

                    x/	Trials Feb./May ’54 – and no commitment thereafter.



		Agreed:  as at x/.

			Subject to Sal., L.P.S., Ch., Sw., C.O., Woolton &amp; M/D.

			seeing agreed publicity line.

			Charge to Service Votes.  Maximum £100.000.





	9.	Atomic Energy Organisation.



Ch.	Decn. of principle – announcemt. Apl. – here is a detailed plan.

		Accept it as a whole.

	A.W.R.E. point is the major point.

	On accounting, I wd. accept anything acceptable to M/D.

	Salaries – I don’t contemplate anything above Board normal level.

	On A.W.R.E. – all arguments in M/S. memo were considered &amp;

		rejected by W. Cttee.

                  x/	No ques. of interfering with weapon development.  Atomic core –

		delivery is for M/S.  But corpn. shd. be responsible for core.

		That is what we are doing now.  Services ask for core of 

		given t.n.t. equivalent : &amp; after discussion we make them.

		The core is never assembled with weapon until bomb is in the

		air.  Must be so because initiator in core has to be renewed

		every few months.

	Separation wd. be bad.  For best fissile for weapons is not best

		for industrial use.  Corpn. wd. be disposed to make fissile most

		suited for industrial.  M/S. wd. then want their own piles.  You

		wd. end with 2 projects – each of them inefficient.    [Exit  W.M.	Separation wd. destroy balance of Waverley report.

	Reference to officials.  Cdn’t get a better, or more impartial, Cttee. than

		Waverley Cttee.



D.S.	Don’t accept x/.  This wd. take away developmt. of most important

		part of weapon.  The core is small.  But to detonate it, it has to

		be surrounded by v. large body of explosive : also v. complex

		system of detonation.  Development (tho’ not prodn.) of the

		3 elements wd. have to be carried out in one place.  Bad in 

		principle to divorce developmt. &amp; prodn.

	For many years all the money will be Exchequer.  Shd. be no diffy. in

		laying down quantities of fissile to be made for civil &amp; for

		mil. use.  Will have to do it anyhow.

	Cab. Cttee. considered this solely fr. angle of civil use.  Transfer of

		respons. for weapons means much closer Govt. control.  9/10’s 

		of organisation can go to corpn. – and corpn. can have a much

		looser control.  No hope of getting legn. non-controversial if

		weapons are transferred.

	Recommend M/S. shd. retain A.W.R.E.  Doesn’t prevent corpn. fr.

		makg. a start – or allowg. Cab. to review posn. later. V. important

		issue :  room for 2 views:  gt. controversy inevitable if we appear

		to be transferring weapons to a corpn.  We cd. reserve decn. on

		that point until corpn. establd.



Ch.	All these points were made to W. Cttee – who decided it wasn’t 

		workable.



L.P.S.	Accept W.’s view.  P. 11 – end of para. 27.



Al.	My concern is to ensure def. interests are safeguarded.

		M/S. &amp; corpn. must have a close link.  That shd. be looked at

		further.  The link must be forged.

	M/D. must be closely associated in all further stages.



D.S.	Shd. not Serv. Dpts. be concerned with only one agent?



Al.	Yes.



Sim.	Mil. effort is of 1st. importance.  Don’t entrust it to a corpn.



O.L.	Govt. has never made weapons.  Depends wholly on private industry.

	Separation wd. go back into all diffies. of past.

		In peace, majority of developmt. is in private sector, not public.

		Guns or aircraft wd. be much less good if produced in Govt.

		establishment.



Sal.	Can you have a better Cttee. or view than Waverley Cttee?

	In U.S., there is no separation.



H.M.	Accept W. Cttee. report – subject to working out the link.



de L.	Can you separate the 2 or more parts of the weapon.       [Exit  Sim.



R.A.B.	Strong support for W. Report

	But can’t we identify the link more clearly before 

	next Cabinet.  Reporting m’while to P.M.

	Cd. L.P.S. Cttee. do this, consultg. Waverley as well

		as interested Ministers.



D.S.	My compromise might be a runner.  Para. 23(1).



		Agreed:    Ch. &amp; D.S. to try to work out a system along

			        those lines.

			        L.P.S. to come in if agreement can’t be reached.

			        Report to P.M.



R.A.B.	Responsible Minister is for P.M.

	Finance – can be settled with Ty.

	Salaries – not out of line with Bds.

	Procurement – Corpn. will have to procure, subject to some Govt.

		control, where it’s a ques of national safety Treaties etc.



M.F.	Security.  We shall have to retain p.v.  Believe respons. Minister

		will need powers of direction to Corpn.

		Second :  will need right of appeal.  Want same Tribunal.

		Third : repercussive effect on contractors.  Cd. be held.
