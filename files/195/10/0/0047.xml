C.C. 33(52)							25th March 1952



		1.	Unemployment in Textile Industries.

	

				[Enter Sw., Maclay., Att.Genl., B-H., Salter.



P.M.	We shd. be ready to spend money to check this.



R.A.B.	Diff. to solve by palliatives.  Want some absorbed in def. prodn.



W.M.	None ready to absorb them there.  10% of labour-force now on part-time.



P.T.	V. large pol. pressure – includg. easing of p. tax.



P.M.	Stock-pile Army clothing – outside Def. Estimates.  Clothing for Home Guard.



Sw.	Only 5-10% of industry.



M.F.	Cd. do with more C.D. uniforms.



P.M.	Won’t do for us to say “let it take its course”.  Classic criticism of Tories between the wars.  Must seek more work for Lancs. and N. Ireland.



P.T.	Japs and U.S. have unemplt. and have cut back production.

	Remedies i) buying more dollar cotton  ii) relief from p. tax.



R.A.B.	Cdn’t hold ii) to textiles : wd. spread to footwear, gloves etc.  Cost in revenue wd. be £40 m.  But may have to adjust p. tax in Fin. Bill.



P.M.	Say in debate we are resolved to apply remedies in short term, pending growth in def. prodn.



B-H.	Opposn. have now decided debate tomorrow shd. be on a motion.





		2.	Economic Conference : Moscow.  Attendance of Conservative 			M.P.



A.E.	Drayson has accepted invitn. to Moscow for Econ. Confce.  Says he will go to encourage trade in textiles.

	Confce. boycotted by T.U.’s and Labour Party Officials.



P.M.	He shd. be dissuaded from going.  Ch.Whip to tackle him.









		3.	Parliament – Foreign Affairs.



A.E.	Opposn. don’t want F.A. debate – next week.

	Shd. I make a non-Party statement in b’cast – Sunday.  I wd. hang it on reply to Soviet note.  B.B.C. are willing.



H.C.	Why on a Sunday?  Will antagonise much feeling.



J.S.	Only on urgent ques.



A.E.	Can’t do it on any other day.



L.P.S.	Shd. regret ordinary pol-action on Sundays.  Wd. lead to Party mtgs. on Sunday, which wd. be deplorable.



M-F.	Pol. advantage to us to avoid politics on Sundays.

	L/N. Union business was done, with parsons’ co-opn. on Sundays.

	A non controversial statement wd. get by.



Sw.	I agree – if limited to non controversial.



R.A.B.	F. Affairs wd. get by on Sundays.



A.E.	Don’t want to establish a precedent.



P.M.	Not inappropriate if its’ a high level, bi-partisan, related to peace etc.



A.E.	Will see wthr. I cd. do it on another evening.



P.M.	Leave it to A.E.’s discretion.



Al.	Try it out and see what’s said.  



A.E. 	Don’t want to be wholly non controversial.





		4.	Road and Rail Transport.



P.M.	“I have bn. much disturbed by this and have bn. doing all I cd. to  disturb others.”



	Much feeling in Party tht. this shd. precede Steel.

	Can’t deal finally with W.’s report today. But if generally approved we might make announcemt, on lines of draft.

	Att.G. has agreed tht. directive cd. then be given to B.T.C. to do nothg. prejudicial to our plans.



	Possibly unnecessary to announce publicly.  If we approved plan, B.T.C. cd. be told privately and persuaded to lay off.

	40.000 lorries under B.T.C. administered by 11.000 officials.  Can never pay in competn. it is admitted.  7-800.000 C. Licences – wasteful one-way traffic to avoid incompetence of natd. haulage.  This must be stopped.



W.	Need we publicly state all that is in draft?  Wdn’t statement of (a) suffice?



O.L.	Wd. provoke cry tht. you are takg. profitable part of natd. undertakg. away and havg. only unprofitable part on backs of taxpayers.  Must have (c) as well.



A.E.	Why (d)?  



Macl.  	Not controversial : wd. relieve anxieties.



M.F.	Yes – eg. l.a. transport.  Wd. be welcomed.



A.S.	(c) involves my point of dissent.



P.M.	Don’t believe this infringes yr. principle because transport is a single whole.



R.A.B.	His dissent goes wider than that.

	Why are long distance road passenger vehicles not subject to levy?



L.	Not w’in goodwill argument.  Their fares have gone up because of increased petrol.  



Macl.  	Controlled under 1930 Act : nos. falling lately.

	Subject to tighter control.



W.	V. little justificn for extendg. levy to them because no goodwill compensn. paid to them.



A.S.	Goodwill argument doesn’t apply to all case for levy.

	Levy on roads to meet rlway losses over indef. future for variety of reasons.  Puts levy on one of 2 competitors wh. will increase in propn. to road’s efficiency and rlways inefficiency.

	Only assurance of rlway efficiency = tht. they must pay their way.



P.M.	Unlimited in time but not in amount.



A.S.	Continuing subsidy for operatg. losses.



P.M.	Rlways’ remedy was to interest themselves in road, and also reduce dividends.  Now compensn. burden is a fixed item.  Rlways must be m’tained for some essential traffics.



Sw.	For 25 yrs. have sought means of compensatg. rlways for cost of m’taining permanent way.  Here at last is a solution.

	But must you keep 25 m. limit until B.T.C. wholly disbanded.



L.	Only temporary – to get transfer completed, at reasonable price.



Sw.	Watch our pledges on this point.  May we discuss with W.?



M-F.	Those not acquired are short distance hauliers.  Not so much cause to complain.  Relaxn. of licence, to cover occasional long journeys, wd. meet the point.

	Don’t agree with A.S. on diffy. of quantifying abstraction of traffic.  Can do it, and make this workable scheme.



A.S.	Cd. do so shortly after Bill.  But 10 yrs. ahead cd. you do so – traffic transfer result from this Act.



R.A.B.	Ty. have grave doubts re this scheme.  Don’t believe this solves road/rail problem.



P.M.	A.S.’s comment is destructive of any practical plan.

	I propose tht. other members of Cab. shd. consult with Cttee. to i) draw up a simpler and shorter announcement  ii) assure ourselves of means of avoiding further prejudicial action by B.T.C.  M’while B.T.C. be told to lay off, or if he won’t he will receive directive.



R.A.B.	Cd. L. and M/T. consult B.T.C. before Cab. reach decision even in principle.



Macl.	Rlways now have no incentive to efficiency at all.  Our plans provide some.



Sw.	How cd. B.T.C. give an impartial opinion on this plan?



P.M.	All I want is an announcemt. sufficient to warrant directive (or agreement) to B.T.C.



P.T.	B.T.C. can’t w’stand competn.  Must sell all or none.



		R.A.B., Sw., J.S., W.M. to consult with Cttee, to get a draft 	statement for approval by Cabinet.

		B.T.C. to be told m’while to lay off.



[Att.G.  	No dirn. can be given until plan approved and announced.]

						[Exit Att.G. , Maclay., A.S.



		5.	Trieste.



A.E.	Diffy because, to help Gasperi 3 yrs ago, Labour Govt with U.S. and Fr. announced tht. whole of both Zones shd. revert to Italy.  Succeeded in getting de G. re-elected, but now has come home to roost.  It./Yugos. deadlock ever since.



	In Paris before Dec. got joint It/Y. talks.  No result.  At Lisbon suggested 3 Power mtg. to impose a solution.  First mtg. held W’ton y’day.  But what now?



	Only solution is for us and U.S. to w’draw fr. Trieste.  Believe U.S. mght now agree.  Result : It. wd. have Zone A and Yugosl. wd. keep B.  Italy wd. get whole City.  3 Powers wd. suggest It/Y. effort to draw ethnographical frontier or transfer of popns.



	Risk : leaves It./Y. fronting one another.

	Advantage : if Italy agrees, we cd. w’draw 10.000 Br. and U.S. troops (5.000 each) costing us £1½ m.

	Anglo/It. relations will suffer if we don’t find a solution.



Sim.	Any part in Zone B. for Yugoslavs?



A.E.	Yes – Pola; and they cd. get some facilities with quid pro quo.



Al.	Fair solution is what A.E. suggests – City to Italy, B. to Yugosl.

	But how?  W’drawal mght precipitate a fight.  Cd. we force agreemt. by saying unless reached w’in specified period we will w’draw.



A.E.	Must go on with elections in Trieste – despite fears expressed by Winterton (local Genl).



P.M.	Services shd. not make appointmts. with ‘diplomatic’ responsibilities save on approval of M/D. who will consult A.E. as required.

			

		

		6.	Soviet Note on Germany.			[Exit B-H.



A.E.	Handed in copies.  To be publd. on Wed. am.  Agreed with U.S. and France.  Adenauer is content with this.



P.M.	Good note.



P.M.	Cd. M/Def. have a map made of Polish E. Frontier – to illustrate the E. and W. Niesse ques.  Small scale for circulation to Cabinet.





		7.	Seretse Khama.



L.P.S.	[Malan has strengthened posn. by getting Hav. to go with him.

	No def. report to make.  Posn. hardening on both sides.]



L.P.S.	Cab approved general line.

	Y’day I. and Ismay saw Mr. and Mrs. Seretse.  They listened, w’out emotion.



	Believed they expected what they were told.  Save Jamaica, which was a surprise : and they wanted to think it over.  V. remunerative offer - £2.000 free of tax + quite a lot more. (?)



	Told announcemt. wd. be made on Thursd.  If he agreed to abdicate we wd. agree reply with him.

	“Cd. he ever go back”?  Said : if he abdicated, prs. he mght. after a period.



	Asked them not to leak.  They have obeyed – to extent of not telling his legal adviser!



	See them again on Wed. at 3 pm.  Thereafter Press will be seen.

	Thursday, statement in both Houses.  Draft A. or B.  If A, must be variable to S. suggn.  If B, will make some changes in para. 4, delete para. 5; and base it on interests of Tribe w’out ref. to S. Afr. opinion.



P.M.	Row in H/C. if we have to do B.

	Isn’t it a bit long?  



L.P.S. 	Will see if it can be shortened.

	Main point, however, is tht. it uses language of Socialist Wh. Paper.  



P.M. 	Don’t make it too much of an attack on S.

	Para. 8 is a bit tough.  Substitute : “For reasons stated in Wh. Paper ….”.





		8.	National Health Service.



H.C.	Adjudicn. on doctors’ pay.  all done by Socialists, save apptmt. of Chairman.

	He has found heavily v. us.  Must inform Parlt. at once.  For 51/52 addl. £9¾ m. for g.p.’s alone.  Will mean Suppl. Est. of £40 m. – more than twice our economies.
