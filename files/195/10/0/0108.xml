C.M. 98(52).				18th November, 1952.



	1.	Coronation.



	Agreed tht. D/W. shd. be discouraged from seeking offl. invitn to

		Coronation.



P.M.	Soc. Govt. agreed to his exporting £80.000. He wants another

		£40.000 – to build a house.



R.A.B.	If there is a v. good case, refer his solr. to me.



H.M.	If you force him to live in exile, it’s unfair to deny him his money.





	2.	Electoral Reform.



P.M.	Formal request from Cl. Davis for depn on this.  Wish to be 

		accompanied, when I see them, by R.A.B. and some other 

		Cab. Minister.





	3.	Armed Forces:  Widows’ Pensions.



Al.	July, recd all-Party deputn led by Ogmore askg. for most of these

		reforms, and for some more wh. I haven’t recommended.

		Widows are urgent:  rates fixed in 1914, though c/living has

		risen by 138%.  Some, who were over 60 in ’48, can’t benefit

		from N.H.I.  Nat. Ass. is £35 p.a. p. child:  Service pension

		only £16.  Restn to officers &amp; w.o.’s is no longer justified, in

		modern condns.  Eventual addl cost = £1 m., but only £160.000

		in 1st year.



R.A.B.	They get N.H.I. pension.  But my diffy is tht. this scheme is out of 

		date.  Can’t we get contributory principle?



Al.	V. diff. with young men joining for only 3 yrs.  Wd deter recruiting.

		Wdn’t cost less than my proposals for widows.



A.H.	Careful study made.  Ty. recognise the diffies of contributory scheme.

		Bn. under consn since ’45.



J.T.	Men don’t go into Services as career until ?????, as do other

		Services.



M-F.	There wd. be repercussions on Police, who wd. demand non-

		contributory increase.



Al.	Anyhow, what of existg. widows, who cdn’t benefit fr. new contrib.

		scheme.

de L.	Must encourage long-service, but can’t guarantee to keep any part.

		individual to 60.  Must have series of short contracts, wh. doesn’t

		accord with contributory principle.



A.H.	This is w’in limit of Ty. contn to a contributory scheme.  A v. modest

		scheme.



	Agreed.	M/Def. &amp; R.A.B. to consider further.  Promise announcemt.

			before Xmas.

			Record:  old scheme:  Armed Forces are difft.



			                                             [Exit  3 Serv. Ministers.

			                                             [Enter  Ll.G., Nutting, Mackesn.

	4.	Argentine Meat Negotiations.



Ll.G.	Effect of no agreemt. less serious now.  Thght. ration might fall to ¼?

		Now Austr. &amp; Urag. supplies, cd. stand at ⅛d until

		end/March.  Amb. thinks tht. if we made that clear, negotns wd.

	x/	be helped.  Shan’t get settlement w’out £20 m. credit and 

		quantity of bully.



R.A.B.	Favour using x/ and continuing discns.  May bring some sense into it.

		Mixture of b) and c).  Give some credit, provided they can’t use 

		it to run down our reserves.  Canned meat, but only in lieu of

		carcase.



Ll.G.          x/	Shd like to offer to take some bully – for stock-pile, e.g. 10.000 tons.



R.A.B.	Only w’in import total agreed already for M/F.



Sal.	Support R.A.B. qua Doms., who dislike our paying higher price for

		Argent. meat.  Also we are about to reject Austr. appln for a 

		credit.



A.N.	Shan’t get our exports in w’out some concession on x/.



P.M.	Need for meat.  Can’t we do (c)?



R.A.B.	As before:  no concession on bully now.  But I will consider wtr. we 

		cd. do it for stock-pile.



A.N.	Remittances:  public utilities.  Do we give way?



R.A.B.	Let’s have the mixed Cttee soon, if we are to have it at all.



Mack.	In essentials – shall get none in. 



A.N.	Credit.  Shd not be carried on F.O. Vote.  It’s for a trade agreement –

		not a pol. gesture.

 

R.A.B.	F.O. are only Dpt. wh. can carry it w’out legn.

			

			Agreed:  Defer decn on that until A.E. returns.





	5.	Delegated Legislation.                             [Exit  Ll.G., A.N., Mack.

			                                                       [Enter  Att.G. &amp; B.H.



Sal.	Live issue in both houses – not Party issue.  Can’t ???? it

		indefinitely:  must have enquiry sooner or later.  Wd wish H/L.

		to be covered – Joint Cttee of both Houses.  H/L. have 

		refrained fr. exercising their strength v. orders.



R.A.B.	Will be a great nuisance if we do change the law.  Ministers attendg.

		a scrutinising Cttee:  or Parlt. havg. power to amend.



H.C.	Tories shdn’t oppose that.



M-F.	Favour para. 8(iii).



Sim.	Deprecate widest form of enquiry á la Donoughmore.  No need to go

		over it all again.  Suffice to review Parly procedure.





	6.	Railway Freights.	[Enter  L-B.



L-B.	Wages &amp; other increased costs will add about £31 m. to costs in 

		full year.

	Tribunal’s 7½% designed to preserve their freedom to deal with

		fares next year.

	I want to authorise only 5% in freight, but warning tht. next yr. 

		B.T.C. will be likely to put fwd. passenger appln.  On 1/1 they

		can raise by ¼d  a mile.

	Inclined to think I shd. announce this before Transport debate is over:

		to avoid being accused of holding it back until after the vote

		on the Bill.



J.S.	Last Dec. 10% rise:  M/T. said wd. be limited to 10/= p. ton.  Cd we

		say this wd be limited to 5/= p. ton.



A.L.B.	Will consider &amp; try to meet you.  Wd have to clear it with Tribunal

		and B.T.C.
