C.C. 91 (52)					29th October, 1952



1.	    Parliament.

		                                                          [Enter Sw., B-H., L-B., D.S.

H.C.	Handling Debate on Address.

	The 2 major Bills will be excluded, by presentn.

	Dev. Charge – subject to H.M.’s view – shd. not be so excluded because policy has not bn. disclosed.

	All Ministers i/c Dpts. shd. be in attendance, as can’t be foreseen what may be raised.  Ch. Whip to draft a notice to Ministers.

	Private Members’ time – 20 days as before.



		Agreed.



P.M.	“A horrible no.” of P. Members’ Bills got thro’ this Session.



H.C.	Many were useful.

					[Enter Att.G.



2.	    Transport Bill.



L.	(i) Levy: majority of Cttee wd. prefer to retain it in suspended form.



L.B.	In favour of dropping it, on balance.  Unpopular:  hampers agreemt. on rlway charge.  On other hand, we have said it’s essential element in plan.  And 70% on C. licences is more diff. to justify if no Part II.



M-F.	Favour suspension.



Sw.	Favour dropping it.  Suspension gives worst of both worlds.  In debate we shall prob. concede it, &amp; m’while shall have forfeited good will of hauliers &amp; industry’s support for rlway charges plan.

	We give much more chance now of rlway profit – less need for levy.



J.S.	Support Sw. strongly.  What gained by puttg. in now provns wh. don’t operate until ’57.  Plenty of time for us or others to do what is needed.



P.T.	Support.  For selling lorries &amp; for encouraging rlways.



H.C.	Agree.  Parly diffies for v. little gain – we aren’t going to do it for yrs.



R.A.B.	Prefer levy operable at once.  Better than nothg. keep suspensory levy.

	Another plan:  levy once for all at 10% p.a. p. ton of freight capacity.

That wd. simplify levy plan:  wd. bring in £5m. to Exchequer and hamper haulage.



A.E.	Susp. levy will have to be conceded in debate - &amp; we shall have worst of all worlds.

P.M.	Favour dropping it.  Opposn will damp down on any concession but magnify any proposal.  cf. criticism of Budget.

	Wd. help sale of lorries &amp; industry’s support for rate provns.



M-F.	Makes Bill ridiculous – no longer any contn to world-wide problem of enabling rlways to pay their way.  No logical basis for Bill.



P.M.	Bill will remedy the ills of natd road transport.  Isn’t that enough?



M-F.	Socialist plan was their solutn of road/rail problem.  Levy was ours. If we drop it now, we are shown to be w’out a solution of that problem. Attrition of rlways by roads is the crucial problem of transport.

	Buying Parly ease by a solution that won’t last does us no good in the end.



A.E.	Suspending it damages M-F’s argument v. seriously.



M-F.	Defend that by saying we shall see how charges plan etc. succeeds.



R.A.B.	Danger that if we drop Part II now we may be forced in Parlt. to drop Part I.



Sim.	On a long view wd. levy on roads save rlways w’out crippling roads?



M-F.	If you exclude State subsidy, they (roads) must.  Industry pays, thro’ their choice of transport.



L.	In straight competn, road will win because of convenience and lower overheads.



P.M.	And giving better service.



L.	Better than during natn, but traffic will be drawn away fr. natd rlways.



Sw.	Rlways will be free to make money out of road transport.



P.M.	These arguments dispose of the suspensory compromise.  Real issue is betwn. immedte Part II and dropping it altogether.



W.M.	Against retaining immed. levy.  Is compromise worth while?  Rlway charge plan ought to help.  Pt I will require £30m.  Pt. II is only £4m. p.a. 4 years hence.  Is it worth having all this fuss &amp; row for only £4m. p.a.  What diffce will that make twds. “saving” the rlways.



P.M.	Revolution in transport is coming anyhow:  is it wise to seek to slow down the change artificially.



R.A.B.	[On Dev. Charge I said I wd. not have tax on land.]  I don’t want Exchequer to pay for rlways, nor do I want to find the money by special tax later.



P.M.	Don’t see relevance of [ ].  And burden of fixed interest on rlways will in the end have to be eased by State.



Sal.	I was opposed to introdn of the Bill.

	Our pledge was to de-nationalise road transport.  levy will delay &amp; prs. defeat that object.  Doubtful if roads can carry rlways, in the end.  Rlways are economically unsound:  if so, we can’t permanently hand them round the necks of a more modern form of transport.

	I favour dropping levy altogether.



P.M.	Preponderant view is in favour of dropping this altogether.  (May get breathg. space for 4 years before State has to aid rlways. 

		L. agreed.)





	(ii) Railway Charges.



L.B.	This will be much eased by decision on (i).

	There will be argument in Parlt. &amp; we may have to make some changes.



L.	N.C.B. have reached substantial understandg. with B.T.C.





	(iii) 25 Mile Limit.



P.M.	This has advantage of being definite.  



Sw.	Cttee are agreed on this.



L.B.	Doubt if we cd. have lifted it earlier than date proposed in Bill.

Believe we shall not have finished sale before then.





	(iv) Sale of Lorries.



P.T.	Under genl. law you must pay 1/3rd &amp; balance over 18 months.

But some easier terms are needed for these.



R.A.B.	If this fails, we may have to provide some State credit.

If Co. will approach B/E. at once, I will ask for speedy consn.



			Agreed     1.   Bill approved for introdn.

			                 2.   M/T. to submit early report, after consultn 	with R.A.B. 

			                       &amp; P.T., on the hire -purchase plans.



3.	    Transport Charges.



L.B.	Wages award will add £4 this year &amp; £18m p.a. to B.T.C.

	Shall refer the matter (appln for increases in freight charge) to Tribunal.



			                                            [Exit L.B., D.S., Att. G., &amp; B-H.



4.	    East West Trade: Drugs.

					                     [Enter Munster

A.E.	Accept fact tht. H. Kong can’t do more.  Hence plan in memo.



Ch.	U.S. don’t export them.  Are they strategic under Battle Act?



P.T.	Not in any list.  No-one else has banned export save U.S.

					[Exit M.

					[Enter Ll.G.

5.	    Food:  Christmas Bonuses.



Ll.G.	Meat due to come down anyway at this time of year.

	Hope Argentine deal can go thro’, for then we cd. free sausages completely.

	Main (continuing) ration changes – Approved. *

	Christmas Bonuses.

		Supply posn no better than last year.  Tea is now free.   Sugar bonus at Xmas wd. mean w’holding a bonus for fruit or special purchase costg. £1m.



R.A.B.	£1/2m non-sterling for fats.  Must we spend extra £1m on sugar.

Does M/F. really want to give bonuses.



Ll.G.	I wd. prefer to keep steady rations as high as poss.



R.A.B.	M/F. expre is £15m. above estimate already in 2nd half of ’52.

B/p. future is not encouraging.



	*  R.A.B.  	P’pone, so tht. I can discuss with M/F



	    P.M.  In general I’m in favour of some bonus (e.g. for cakes &amp;        	

                                      puddings).

	

	*  All changes to be announced together.





6.	    Food:  Enforcement of Controls.



Ll.G.	30 enforcemt. offrs. recently shed.

	(Another 350 staff will go at end/year because freeing tea)

7.	    Egypt:  Defence Negotiations.

			                                          [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers &amp; C.O.S.



A.E.	New factor –Turkey.  This is interim hand for Amb. to play until we have a wholly new policy.



C.I.G.S.	Neguib is best bet we have had in E.

	We wd. give him some arms, in bldg. some jets.

	We wd. also begin w’drawal of re-inforcemts.  We don’t think Rhodes is likely to be requd if we support Neguib.  Even if worst came, we are better off w’out Farouk.;  for we wdn’t have to rescue him  &amp; in new situation we shd. hesitate to do it, for it wd. mean war with E.

	We don’t want genl. def. talks now because reviewing M/E. strategy.



A.E.	Agree -  this is a holding operation.



Al.	But friendly gesture wd. help e.g. w’drawal of Para. Brigade fr. Cyprus to U.K.



A.E.	Wd. prefer to consult Amb.  They are a tough lot, like young Turks.

They are impd by strength.



Al.	Can’t keep them long.  Get pol. credit for w’drawal.

	Want also to get work going on M/E. H.Q. in Cyprus – on assumptn of some success in M.E.D.O. talks.



A.E.	Want to be able to present any w’drawal to our credit.



C.I.G.S.	Increased confidence in Neguib.  



A.E.	Or re-organn in M/E. as a whole.



P.M.	Not so fast.  Only a short time since we nearly put Rhodes in.

Also w’drawal always considered as part of genl. agreement.



A.E.	N. doesn’t want a row with us.



C.A.S.	Also we haven’t the troops tht. wd. be needed in new circs. to do a Rhodes.



R.A.B.	W’drawal helps me.



A.E.	Review of M/E. defence policy must be complete before I can see how to play the diplomatic hand.



P.M.	What of the base?  



Al.	That also turns on the review.

A.H.	Contents are now being classified.     



* P.M.  	Give me a report on this.



P.M.	Wd. help us to shape long-term policy if we knew views of new U.S.

	Govt.

	They might take some share of the responsibility.



A.E.	We can prob. get U.S. to come into MEDO. H.Q. at Cyprus.  Might move them on from that to do more.



		General opinion in favour of Cyprus base. But no authy to start work there at once, P.M. wanting to have a detailed report to Cabinet.

	

P.M.	Report to come to Cabinet on necessary preliminary moves.



		F.O. memo approved.
