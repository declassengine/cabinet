C.C. 23(52)							28th February 1952



		“External Sterling”.				[Enter A.S. and Sw.



R.A.B.	I adhere to original plan.  Alternative circulated only at P.M.’s  request.

	That alternative wd. be admn. tht. we were struggling thro’ next 2/3 months.  Wd. involve v. severe cuts.  My plan won’t restore pattern of trade or save b/p.  But it’s only means of saving currency.

	If we fail to do that £ will be devalued far below 2.40 – with much more serious effects on prices, emplt. etc.  We shan’t get thro’ summer; we shd. take bold course.  Experts in trade and economics oppose it.  But pattern of our trade has bn. artificial and return to free market will alter it.  Won’t solve our problems.  But only plan to save currency and take knock on rate not reserves.  Will restore Ldn. as fin. centre – increase invisibles – Bold action wh. will bring new vigour.  W’out it, can’t hold posn. on reserves thro’ summer.



H.C.	Accept R.A.B. views.  His case prevails, on the arguments.  V. apprch. of its effect. extern. and intern.  In short run we may get into grave diffies.  Pol. criticism v. sharp.  But must face it.

	To get better weather.  Govt. may fall.



J.S.	Country doesn’t appreciate gravity of situation.  They won’t until somethg. drastic is done.  Support this on that a/c.



Ch.	Dissent.  Floating rate and convertibility will be fatal.

	Problem : to balance trade.  If rate falls, that is more diff.

	Drain on reserves this way will be more serious.

	Unpleasant part of alternative will have to be done under this plan too.



	Consequences : rise in import prices : unemplt. : painful re-adjustmt. more exports for fewer imports.  All paymts. agreemts go. 

	Diffies. of export trade.  E.P.U.  Possible loss to s.a. of Comm. countries.  U.S. dislike of it.



	And on top of that, more diff. to balance our trade.

	What advice is given by Plowden and Hall etc.  Cd. we not see their views?  Economists don’t favour this.  “Surrender to Banks”.

	May provoke serious troubles eg. strikes.



L.	Plan will not meet our need.  But if it’s true tht. our immed. sitn. is worsening so fast, prs. we shd. do it.

	Can’t we delay decision?  Can’t be sure this will succeed.

	Prefer to take safer course and see what we can do.



M-F.	Started in favour of R.A.B.  Thought more about it.  Can’t decide w’out informn. on (i) Drain.  $300 m. p. month.  Ch. says cuts already made shd. be felt after end/Feb.  Why won’t that come in at $120 m. p. month.  Must know why it isn’t now taken into a/c?  With borrowg. we cd. reach a better posn. at end/June than we had assumed.  (ii) Effect on Doms.  P. and Ceyl. may leave s.a.  A. and l. doubtful.  What is effect of that?

	On Comm. co-operatn? A  With £450 m. st. balances, genuine, won’t like to see 80% frozen.  (iii) Europe.  E.P.U. to be killed and trade to be deliberalised.  Much of our hopes for integrn. of E. have gone.

	But this wd. rouse feeling v. us, in Europe.  Also U.S. reaction to our treatment of Europe.  (iv) Positn in U.K.  What unemplt. wd. follow, and where.  Due to direct shortage of materials or indirect result of changing pattern of our exports.

	Think we shd. know what is involved.   All the classic charges v. Tories will be revived.



R.A.B.	Drain $297 m. Jan.  $270 m. Feb.  No pause to end/Feb.

	On 11/2 sent tel. to Comm. F.M.’s saying $750 m. loss in 1st qur. with reserves at $1.580 m. at end = devaluation point.  Due to speculation and short-fall in U.S. aid.  This point due to be reached 2 mos. before date we expected.



M-F.	But what effect will cuts have after end/Feb.



R.A.B.	They will begin in March to show effect, we hope.  But

	i) no effect fr. C.F.M. yet  ii) E.P.U. posn. is worse, now paying in gold 

	iii) r.s.a. material prices have dropped  iv) traffic in cheap sterling.



O.L.	These are deadly decns.  Critics must face alternatives.

	M-F. fears unemplt.  What if we don’t do this.  If we have no reserves, to buy imports.  Critics face a dilemma : if they believe cuts will save posn. they shdn’t fear effect on rate: If they don’t then where are we.



Ch.	Fallacy in O.L. = time element. We all agree trade must be balanced by autumn.  Our anxiety is wthr. our reserves last until then. …..  Read from a memo.  Durg. interval, plan will make it more diff. to balance.



O.L.	Immed. drop in rate affects future contracts, not present.  For a time we cd. live on supplies in pipe-line.  Time factor favours the plan.  Sterling over-valued now – encourage people to sell sterling.



A.E.	Diff. dilemma.

	V. disturbing tht. so soon after C.F.M. we now face a v. diff situation.  Shakes my confidence in our advisers.

	Plan “to save currency”.  Can’t believe it.  Disadvantage : immed. result – genl. resln. of trade because of dislocation.  Countries buy here because of soft currency : they won’t buy if we are “hard” will prefer U.S. then.  Those who now spend sterling to save dollars won’t do so any longer.  Wd. therefore increase our dollar gap.  Means drop in rate – and higher prices and unemplt.

	What retaliation by f. countries?  Some, certainly.

	Serious blow to Eur. unity efforts.

	If intended to support 2.40 rate, reserves will be used for that as fast as they are now being used?

	Plan to reduce home consumptn. by increase prices.  Grim policy.

	Alternative :	Block some balances w’out floating rate.

			M’tain 2.80.  Severe Budget.  More cuts in imports and

			investmt.  Canadians loan for timber for housing.

			Cut defences p’mme.

			Raise bank rate.



	Prefer that to R.A.B. plan, results of wh. can’t be foreseen.



P.T.	Support original plan as against his alternative.

	Pol. diffies., cuts, unemplt. are about the same either way.

	But another way of doing it wh. wd. meet some of A.E.’s points.

	Two stages.	i)  Severe Budget : bank rate : cut defence and housing

			    (without loan fr. Can.)

			ii) End/March hold Comm. Confce. and then do st.

			    balances, fl. rate and agreemts. on inter-sterlg. trade,

			    Impose summer cuts, tobacco, Jap. textiles etc.



	Pig it during the gap.  $1.800 m. now.  Drain at 300 m. p. month.

	Only $1.500 m. by end/March.  That is minimum safe level.



	Advantages:	a)  Demonstrated done all poss. to put own house in 			     order.

			b) Avoids shock to Doms. by tel.  Cd. seek their

			     agreemt. in discn.



I.	R.A.B. plan will be gt. shock to Doms. esp. as no mention of it in

	Jan.  But don’t think any gt. pol. upheaval if we give due notice –

	inform in next 72 hrs.



	India.  Agreemt. signed only 3 wks. ago.  £35 m. p.a.  V. careful presentn. to N. assurg. money for developmt.  Cd. get by.

	

	Australia.  V. rough.  Only enough for 2 mos.  But they are overspendg. and if they won’t check it someone must.  A. might leave s.a.



	Pak and Ceylon might, prob. wd. leave st. area – tho’ not Commonwealth.



	S.A. wd. be OK. because gold.



	Canada wd. welcome this, tho’ not affected.



P.M.	Heartening.  Another mtg. v. soon.



W.	Alternative.  May be somethg. else, nearer a compromise.

	Reply to M-F.  We shall get unemplt. and import cuts in any event.

	Sterling over valued and world realising it.

	Diff. to estimate immed. import cut on R.A.B. plan.  V. drastic cuts

	envisaged in alternative.

	Raise bank rate at once – wd. help to attract for. money.

	Disposed to favour floating rate.  It’s a gradual process.  Ch. plan envisages v. drastic cut.  



Ch. 	On inessentials.  



W. 	There aren’t enough.  Fl. rate wd. produce redn. in imports because of rising prices.

	Freezing balances. Effect on Ldn. credit as world banker.

	Like P.T. plan of 2 stages.



A.S.	Fear this scheme if introduced early with Budget.

	i)  B/p.  Agree with Ch. and A.E. tht. origin dislocn and hard currency status we shall worsen it beyond stimulus of 2.40.  This means cuts as severe as under alternative.



	ii) Currency.  If b/p. not cured, this doesn’t save it.  Pressure at 2.40 wd. exhaust reserves.  Or we shd. have to let it go below.

	If main b/p. task is on money, it means 30’s over again.



	iii) External.  Kills E.P.U. at once.  It may die anyway : this wd. kill it.

	Suppose this wrecks N.A.T.O. what effect on U.S.

	Balances = default as a banker because of compulsory funding.

	And this before we have shown our measures and tht. we have no alternative.  With a month’s delay, this diffy. wd. be less.

	Wd. like to see a floating rate.  But not fr. a posn. of gt. weakness.



Sw.	Condl upon Comm. acceptg. funding plan – we cdn’t do it w’out for we’d be accused of brkg. st. area.  Must therefore ask first.

	Can’t do it in Confce. : for their decns. must be taken in this Cabinet Fund is better for them than dollar rationing.

	If Comm. agreed, I wd. do this plan in Budget.

	If Ch. is right tht. our posn. is so wk. tht. plan can’t succeed – then its so weak tht. our reserves will run out v. soon.  Then we are left w’out a policy.  If you adopt all measures in R.A.B.’s alternative (and these are more drastic than what is requd. by original plan) all the criticisms wh. M-F. fears can and will be made.  And nothg. constructive or positive.

	If we must have these evils, let’s have them with a positive element added.



	Alternative plan will have equally bad effect on Europe – discriminatg. cuts etc.

	Balance 90% funded with 10% and current a/c free – will affect bankers, but not people – traders who wd. by direct cuts.

	No-one supposes this is money at call.  Wd. they not rather have a real call on 10% and the rest funded.



Sim.	Impressed by certain perils and uncertain success of the plan.

	Support A.E. and A.S.  But little time to consider.

Sal.	Not ready to give final opinion.  Shaken by what has bn. said tonight.  Feasibility in a democracy depends on what can be accepted.  Must bring people to see need.

R.A.B.	Can’t give warning of financial changes.



A.E.	Can’t consult Pak. and India w’out its being known.



P.M.	V. diff. indeed.  Can’t decide tonight.

	Meet at 11 am. Friday.  Then try to decide.

	Not v. good show, after recent C.F.M.  Also changing date of Budget.  Gives impn. of uncertainty.

	Appeal for unity, whatever may be decided.  United support for R.A.B.



	Are we sufficiently united in conviction to plunge into the most extreme course?  I doubt it.  Maybe somethg.



R.A.B.	I know I can save sterling with my plan.  I don’t know if I can save it on another.





		2.	Income Tax R. Commission.



R.A.B.	W. wants to resign.  Not before debate.  But he may have to resign then.



P.M.	In things outside controversial area, we prob. can afford to bow to opinion.



L.P.S.	I agree.  Important enquiry.  Bad if 50% of H/C. distrusted it.

	But better for W. to resign now.  He shd. take initiative and go before criticism.



R.A.B.	Shd. we truckle to this sort of criticism of a man with W.’s record.



A.E.	Can’t see him thro’ debate and then let him resign.



J.S.	If he doesn’t carry it thro’, he shd. resign of his own volition.



R.A.B.	Somethg. to be said for closing it all down.



J.S.	Cd. a Deputy wind it up w’out a new Chairman.

	

P.M.	Let him write a lr. to me, which I won’t disclose until the debate.
