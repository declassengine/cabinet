C.C. 58(52)							10th June 1952



		1.	Steel Bill.			[Enter D.S., A.H., Birch., Sw.



D.S.	Leakage re W. Paper.  May I say, in reply to P.Q., tht. W. Paper will be publd. shortly.



P.M.	Want to see W. Paper first.  Let me see it in draft.





		2.	Durham Dispute.



W.M.	Now referred to me by Council as a dispute.  Will ask them to define what dispute is : they may then put themselves out of court.  But they may want to climb down.  M/Ed. agrees.





		3.	Commonwealth Conference.



P.M.	Read proposed reply to P.Q. re P.M.M.



P.T.	I have one too.  No. 3 for today.  Read draft answer.

	Menzies last night suggd. a Comm. mtg. on economic ques.



R.A.B.	Don’t suggest we haven’t got a policy.



P.T.	Major ques : no need to apologise for not havg. ready answer.



P.M.	Say : hope discuss at early convenient opportunity.





		4.	Textile Orders for Defence Programme.



P.T.	Fall in prices is main cause of reduced money total.  But we are firmly pledged to a figure of £20-25 m.  Recommend another £5 m. orders outside p’mme - £3 m. in cotton and £½ m. of this on M/H. orders for sheets etc.  This wd. enable us to increase orders in N.I.  This, all told, wd. mean £22½ -23 m.



R.A.B.	£20 m. wd. suffice.  Wd. corresp. to £25-27 at original prices.

	Don’t favour union via cotton.  Wd. mean suppl. est. for M/H.

	Put in hosiery : £2 m. of Service orders : keep out of union cloth.



M-F.	Was in Belfast last wk. Govt. v. much upset because getting only £1.9m.

	In Lurgan 40% unemplt. – 23% overall.  No sign of getting better in summer, as it usually does.  Cotton content of union wd. give prelim. work to Lancs.  Only £300.000 at stake.



W.M.	2.2% in G.B. over 10% now in N.I.  V. bad situation – 4 times worse than us.  I wd. welcome somethg. more.



R.A.B.	Direct subsidy to N.I.  



P.M. 	To prevent excessive local unemplt.



P.T.	Can’t help N.I. w’out both £22½ m. and union.



D.S.	I support M-F., on basis of recent visit to N.I.

	We cd. place more canvas orders; but they cdn’t absorb more at once; they wd. have continuing work in canvas mills.  Wdn’t help immediate unemplt.



L.P.	Union sheets are made in same mill as linen sheets – val. exports.



D.S.	Suggest stock-piling for current ???? in 1954/5.  This wd. include canvas.



R.A.B.	Can’t be sure union cloth wd. meet Service requirements.  



D.S. 	Not so.  Doubts only about rayon.



P.M.	Danger of greatly increased unemplt.  If it occurred, I wd. strongly recommend public works p’mme.  Tory Govt. can’t w’stand reproach tht. they brght unemplt. back.  Large p’mmes must be ready.

	[Against cost we can always offset the dole (now v. high).

               x	[Mustn’t be caught in a hurry – must look ahead now.

	A Cttee shd. be apptd. to make constructive proposals.



R.A.B.	N.I. and part of Lancs are abnormal.  Ordinarily, we must allow some unemplt. to ensure mobility into export trades.  Can’t afford to put more effort with home investment projects as p. works.



L.P.	1944 W. Paper : advised stimulatg. home consumptn. as a means of averting unemplt.  Prefer tht. to p. works.  That’s why I support textile orders.



P.M.	10% unemplt. here (as now in N.I.) wd. mean 2 m.  Can’t brush that aside.  They have not used Parly. pressure in own interests.



W.M.	Textiles is special case : no movement yet in other employmt. figures.



							       	 [Enter A.E.



J.S.	Concentn. of orders on N.I. draws it off fr. elsewhere – eg. linen industry in Scotland, who haven’t bn. asked to tender.  



D.S. 	Their prices are often higher.  



P.T. 	Was policy to concentrate on area of heavier unemplt.  Scotland is not one of these.



R.A.B.	Unsound financial decisions undermine our credit.



P.M.	Def. expenditure is unsound financially.



H.C.	Is it unsound to give better quality sheets to hospitals?



H.M.	And less dollar content in union than in cotton.



Ch.	Why not go to £20 m. only?  And give much of extra £3½ m. to N.I.?



Sw.	Why give the £1.5 to Leicester etc. where there is v. little unemplt. and many alternatives?



P.T.	We said £20-25.  £20 wd. only just qualify.

	Hosiery : R.A.B. didn’t object : will provide emplt. in spinning in Lancs and Yorks.



A.H.	No. 1. Dress for Coronation (blues) : part wool, part cotton : £600.000.

	Really shd,. be placed in June.



Sal.	Costs for Coronn threaten to be £3 m.

		

P.M.	1) Accept memo. in principle, subject to minor

	    adjustments in light of discussion.

	2) Cttee to prepare v. risk of more w’spread unemplt.



R.A.B.	Want my view recorded.  



P.M. 	V. well.



P.M.	Cttee shd. include W.M., Sw. (Chairman), H.M., Salter, D.S.  Other Dpts. and Ministers may offer suggns. and attend.



D.S.      *	Record view tht. as little as poss. of new orders to put into wool.



							[Exit A.H., Birch.

		5.	European Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	Chairmanship of O.E.E.C. – unanimous will do us good.

	Belgium’s excessive credits.  Solution satisfy. to us – avoids paymt. in gold.  $30 m. dollars in def. equipmt. promised from U.K.

	General reserve – with U.S. Aid we are holding our own.

	Imports fr. Europe.  The failure to fall to continuing orders from R.S.A.

	We shall have to press them all further.

	There has bn. some switching on imports into U.K.



A.E.	Also we cd. not have pressed Europe to take more from us.



							            [Exit D.S.

		6.	Passenger Fares.				[Enter L-Boyd.



L-B.	Agreed in debate we shd. not allow dispropte increases in special concession rates.  This schedule carries out our undertakg.

	Agreemt. with B.T.C. on all points save season tickets and shift workers facilities.  On first, they object in principle and on grds. of admin. diffy.  May have to give directions on these 2 points : won’t give way easily.



A.E.	Done well to get so wide a measure of agreemt.



L.	May avoid direction.  May not be legal, on a specific point.



L-B.	If Cab. approve left-hand column, I will put them formally to B.T.C.

	Wd. like to get this settled before next Thursday’s P.Q.’s.





		7.	B.B.C. Governors.			[Exit L-B. Enter P.M.G. 								[and B-H.

P.M.	We have to appoint a new Board.



P.M.G.	About to submit recommendations.

	Suggest we ask present Bd. to carry on for maximum of 2 months, but aim at new Board before House rises.

	Shd. like that said tomorrow.  All are prepared, if asked, to carry on, pro-tem.  They wd. not, however, appoint the new D.G.

	No urgency over that, for Haley stays until October.



M-F.	Method of apptmt.  Cab. agreed we shd. w’draw the new proposal if greatly criticised in debate.  When do we announce that?

	Shd. Gammans give it away in winding up – or only offer to re-consider in light of debate.  Shd. have to announce it next day.



P.M.G.	Take it C.R.A. wd. oppose it – can be assumed.



B.H.	Whips don’t like any disturbance of balance.  If we give way on this, we may lose the division.



M.F.	Then we had better promise re-considn. and no more.



H.C.	There will perhaps be an Opposn. amendmt. related to this para.

	We can’t vote v. that on Wed. and then accept it on Thursday.



Sim.	It’s removal as well as apptmt. : is wrong to bring the Judges into that kind of issue.  V. serious matter.  I cdn’t defend proposal v. that criticism.



H.C.	Cd. meet that by dropping out the Judges.



		If no amendment, promise to re-consider.

		If an amendment, we must vote against it.

		

P.M. 	Meet at 10.15 Monday.

			

P.M. 	H.C., B.H., J.S., M.F., Sim., P.M.G., A.E. and W. (if poss.)



{10.15 pm

{10 Downing St.



{or 7.30 pm.

{in H/C. if amendmt available.					[Exit P.M.G.

							[Enter de L’isle.



		8.	Germany : Contractual Settlement.



A.E.	Minor legn. on immunities.  Don’t want separate Bill.  Plan to include it in B/T. Bill.

	Debate on ratification. 30/6 and 1/7 suggested.  Suits me.

	May I promise debate in due course.



H.C.	I will discuss that thro’ usual channels.



A.E.	Berlin :  R. have given way on outlying bits of Zone.  And we have made corr.g concessions re B’casting House!



								[Exit B-H.

		9.	U.S. Air Force : Mission of Bombers.



A.E.	B.36 (largest) bombers (20) to come on training mission.  On 18/6.

	For 3 days.  From Spain.  To test base facilities.

	Will be a noticeable armada.  Prev. only 8 or 9 came at a time.

	Wondered wthr. to ask them to divide this bunch into 2 parts.



P.M.	Will draw attentn. to E. Anglian base.  If to test take-off, one alone cd. do it.  May be disturbance.  Don’t like emphasising tht. we are the carrier.



de L.	They intend to do an exercise over W. Europe (sight and range).



P.M.	Worse still.  Let them send one only.

	We must not parade our intent to throw bombs at them.



		Agreed :	F.O. to discourage this.  At least it shd. be 

				limited to one or two.

							[Exit de L’isle.





		10.	Bamangwato Tribe.



Sal.	The Queen’s message cd. not be delivered at Kgotla ground because disorder.

	Ordered minority not to use the ground.  Then attack made on Police – 3 of whom were killed.  Ringleaders now arrested and removed to south.  Position restored.  But I want to make it clear tht. law and order must be restored and mischief makers must be punished.



	Propose to resist any demand for enquiry.  Facts are well known.
