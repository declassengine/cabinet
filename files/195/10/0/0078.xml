C.C. 65(52).				3rd July, 1952.



	1.	Corporal Punishment.	[Enter Sw., B-H.



M-F.	Offences for wh. c.p. was available have not increased since powers

		repealed.



Sim.	Surprised by Goddard’s remarks.

	Confirm M-F.’s view.

	Crimes of violence (for wh. c.p. never available) have increased.

	Imposs. to say abolition of c.p. has led to increase in crimes of 

		violence.



M-F.	Diff. therefore to reverse Parliament’s decision.



P.M.	Let Cab. have the figures since 1900.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for following week.

	Thurs:  Indy &amp; Emplt. in Scotland.

	Shall be asked to-day, again, about Recess.  If we avoid debate on

		Steel, we cd. rise on 6/8.



P.M.	That means a whole week for 2 days.



H.C.	3, if they sit on Mon.



J.S.	They might ask to sit on Thurs. vice Mon. (Bank Holiday).



P.M.	Cd we not take remaing. Fridays?



H.C.	No:  business has bn. allotted by ballot.  We have 2 Govt. Fridays 

		anyhow.



P.M.	Better sit on Sat., than go into followg. week.



H.C.	Opposn will be unhelpful because Transport Bill.



P.M.	Let me see the forecast to end/Session.



H.C.	21 days to 10/8.  9 for all business save Supply etc.  That must cover

		Civil List, Bills, 1½ days on Germany, 2 on Transpt., 2 on 

		Econ. Sitn.  Makes no allowance for votes of censure.



P.M.	What precedents for sitting on Bank Holiday?



M.F.	1947, 1948 – on Emergency Powers.



H.C.	If we p’poned Transport until after Recess &amp; had no debate on Steel

		Opposn wd. co-operate in getting away before the Bank Holiday.



P.M.	Pity to miss Transport.



			                                                     [Enter  D.S. &amp; Solr. Genl.



	3.	Iron &amp; Steel Industry.



D.S.	Draw attentn to followg:-

	Para. 3.	Askg. T.U.C. what wording they wd. accept.

	Para. 9.	Sale may take some years.  Desirable to show realism.



P.M.	Will that impede the sales?  Fear of Socialist reversal.



O.L.	Useful to include it.  Won’t affect buyers, who will have reversal

		in mind.  But shows we aren’t going to throw it all away at 

		once to low bidders.



Sw.	Realistic.  I favour it.



D.S.	Para. 11.  Makes it clear we shan’t relate price to compensn money 

		paid in each case, but shall sell at current market value.

		Para. 17.  Steel stock will be taken back at market value not at

		par.



O.L.	Unwise to use words referring to “security prices”.  I would prefer –

	“other considns such as the monetary condns prevailg. at the time”.



R.A.B.	“monetary and market condns” mght. be acceptable.

	I will settle the words with O.L. &amp; M/S. afterwards.   [Enter  L. Boyd.



D.S.	Assets have changed since natn.  Therefore, no link with compensn

		cost.

	Para. 12.  Will try to give large cos. chance to buy back their earlier

		interests.



L.B.	In Transport, we can’t give priority to former road-hauliers.  May be 

		said tht. we do it for share-holders and not for business-holders.



P.M.	The reason for the discrepancy rests in the facts, which are different.



J.S.	Is it necessary to include 12.



D.S.	Want to get the big cos. thinking about this problem.

			

			Agreed:  retain para. 12.



D.S.	Para. 14.  Stresses diffce betwn. Corpn &amp; the Agency.  Makes it clear

		tht. Agency will not control policy or adminn of cos.

O.L.	Add:  “and the confirmation of reports of accounts” – to complete

		descriptn of ordinary rights of shareholders.	           Agreed.

	Para. 22 &amp; Appendix.       Approved.

	Para. 25.  Emergency powers.  Bd’s powers relate to ques. w’in

		industry in normal times.  No powers to deal e.g. allocn:  those

		are for Govt.  But we do propose Govt. action in consultn with

		Bd. &amp; we may sometimes act thro’ Bd.



O.L.	I wd. omit final sentence of para. 25:  looks like an argument for 

		natn.



M-F.	Cd omit paras. 25-26.  This applies to any industry.



P.M.	Mght. help to reduce controversy.



H.M.	These apply to “circs. of serious econ. diffy”, not to war.  There will

		always be serious econ. diffy as far ahead as we can see.



D.S.	I want para. 26 anyhow.

			

			Agreed:  Cttee to consider omission of para. 25.

	Para. 30.	Approved.



Ch.	Para. 33.  Does this give more powers &amp; bring more firms under

		the Bd.



D.S.	Will be needed after emergency powers cease.



Sw.	Bd’s decision on prices must be enforced.  Criminal Sanction wd. be

		too strong.  This makes it contractual oblign – civil action.



D.S.	Appendix.  Under natn whole cos. were taken over.  Any co. engaged

		beyond a defined point in any of the scheduled activities, the 

		whole co. was taken over.  We can define by processes.

		These (App) are the basic processes.

	Para. 4.  Iron founders want to come under Bd.  They use vast

		quantities of material:  Steel founders are divided:  &amp; majority

		don’t want to come under Bd. (mainly the smaller ones).  Must

		bring them in v. their will.

	Para. 5.  Further talk with Fedn.  Now want to delete “drawing” –

	*	but to include manufacture of bright steel bars.  Drawers don’t

		want to be in.  Also wd. wish to exclude extrusion.    Agreed

		subject to discn with Steel Cttee.



P.M.	Steel Cttee to consider these points &amp; give final approval

		at Tuesday’s Cabinet.



	Agreed.



H.C.	If we present this, debate will be needed.

	What advantage gained by publn?  How soon can this be done?

	If we can’t legislate for months ahead, is it wise to publish now.



P.M.	We will decide that too on Tuesday next.



D.S.	Wd it be poss. to present but not debate before recess.

	If there must be a debate, no time to be lost in publishing.



Sw.	Cdn’t publish this &amp; Transport in same week.



Sal.	Share H.C.’s doubts:  will reserve comment until Tuesday.

				[Exit  Sol. Genl., D.S.

				[Enter  Att.G. &amp; G.Ll.

	4.	Transport Bill.



L.B.	As in memo.

	Rlway. Interest in Road Services.



L.B.	As in memo.



R.A.B.	The interests wd. be sold at a loss.

	M/T. already has enough power under s. 4(5) of Act of 1947.



L.B.	Tho’ that power remains, it cdn’t be used to make Commn sell.



M-F.	It was related to ancillary non-transport activities.  Grave doubts wtr.

		s. 4(5) wd. suffice for this purpose.



L.B.	Even if it wd., Party wd. dislike seeing nothing on this point in 

		this Bill.



R.A.B.	Mght. lead to increase in levy.



L.B.	Shdn’t exercise the power w’out concurrence of Ty.



Sw.	Only an enabling power:  no intn to use it at once.  May want the

		power after Cttee has enquired.



R.A.B.	Wiser if M/T. said v. little on this pro tem.  There will be a new

		B.T.C. with wh. M/T. shd. be on better terms.



L.B.	B.T.C. haven’t protested v. this, any more than v. other powers in 

		Bill.

			* Agreed:  R.A.B. to consult with L. and L.B.



Sw.	Cttee may have reported before Bill is passed.

			

			Bill approved subject to clearing*.

			Time-table:  to be settled betwn. L.B. and Sw.



	5.	Road Passenger Services.



L.B.	Changes	i)    B.T.C. acquisition of large interests in road pass. 

			             services.

			ii)   growing disparity betwn. road &amp; rail fares.

			iii)  contract carriage decn of High Ct.

	In view of this, suggest Cttee under G. Thesiger, with t. of r. as

		stated.



P.M.	No objn.

			Approved.



P.M.	Ask wtr. members wd. be willing to be approached.  Then we can look

		at list again.

				[Exit  L.B., Att.G.



	6.	Open-cast Coal Mining in East Lothian.



G.Ll.	I don’t think we shd. work this site.  Wd affront agric. opinion, and

		impede open-cast operations over country generally.
