C.C. 18(51)							19th December 1951



		1.	Visit to Paris.				[Enter Att.G. and A.Head.



P.M.	Good visit.  Fr. relief tht. no Anglo. U.S. gang-up.

	Made some concessions fr. my angle – poor E. Army is best we can get

	But as we aren’t to be in it, I cdn’t press my technical objns.

	Visit has put Fr. at their ease.  Won’t row over our not being in E.A.

	I won’t crab it publicly.

	Avoided seeing de Gaulle.  Pleven had thght of askg. him to join in mtg us, but feared he wd. refuse.  Think I’ll write him a letter saying cdn’t see him because Fr. politics : want him on right side.





		2.	Egypt.



A.E.	Reported on his talk with E. For. Minister.  Paris Tel. 6.

	Learned this am. his attitude may be due to own instability in Egypt.

	He promised to report to his Govt.  We mght have discns. – unlikely.

	But also i) Amb. will report direct to King.  ii) Considg. approach by Stevenson to King.

	Situation is not quite so rigid.





		3.	War Criminals.



A.E.	i)  No complete records to show wthr. court took into a/c pre-trial custody.

	In most cases have had to assume they did not.

	First list – neither famous nor infamous.

	We don’t touch those in Spandau because not w’in our jurisdiction.



	ii) Long-term plan.  Object : to get clemency out of our hands.

	Those who are still v. war criminals won’t like this because Br. will be in a minority.  A majority of B. judges wd. be embarrassing to us.

	We really want to pass the buck.

	Designed to apply in all 3 Zones if the others agree.  Must be negotiated as part of “contract” with Germany.  U.S. will accept this : French may.  Adenauer will accept it.

	The worst of these men G. don’t want released.  Doesn’t therefore follow that because G. judge is included w’spread clemency will be shown.



Sal.	Worried because will give final decn. to neutral.  If it were justice that wd. be right.  But this is mercy – wh. shd. be exercised by Power which imposed sentence.

	Wd. have preferred plan (iv) on p. 2 of memo.



Sim.	Crime is against conscience of the World, not v. Allies.  On that basis clemency can be exercised by neutral.  That wd. be way to defend it.

P.M.	Neutral shd. be chosen fr. Swiss – who had only real right to remain neutral.  Sweden’s neutrality was interested.

	Willing to accept this plan.  Fear, however, it will provoke G. pressure v. Manstein, Kessdring etc.



A.E.	That will balance the criticism which I fear, on the other side.

	

[P.M.  	Let A.E. circulate to Cab. O’Malley’s report on Catine ??]

	*  A.E.’s two memoranda are approved, subject to following -



A.H.	Mil. courts passed these sentences.  Review shd. be on clemency

	only.													                             [Exit Att.G and A.H.

Sim.	Agree.





		4.	Persia.



A.E.	Restlessness of U.S. makes things worse.  They keep on dribbling out bits to keep M. alive.

	Bank suggest Batt amendmt. shdn’t exclude help to Persia.

	M. is obviously trying to b’mail U.S.- for election purposes.



L.	This is our only chance of getting a solution.



A.E.	In reply to P.M.  M. shd. save more than ⅓rd. from the wreck – between 40% and 50%.  



L.  	Might even get 50%.  If we had to give some of that to U.S. we wd. sell that interest to them.



P.M.	Can we get Iraq to get their pipe-line to work – to feed Haifa w’out going thro’ Canal.



A.E.	Cos. operatg. in Gulf have agreed not to send oil to Haifa, to avoid enraging Arab feeling.  And refinery may not be in good working order.  Thght mght unite other Arab States again with E.

	Poss. to run a pipe-line from Aqaba to Med.  That I’m now investigating.  Wd. give Jews what they want – possibly with less trouble with Arabs.  M/F. and P. shd. look kindly on that idea.



P.M.	Cd. advise U.S. in W’ton talks, to leave it alone and let us play the hand in Persia.





		5.	Kashmir.



I.	Report posn. of negotns.

	All agree plebiscite only way of settlement.  Must de-militarise first.

	Graham reported in Oct. on this.  India objected : he asked for 6 more wks.  Shortly will say no progress.  We must then decide : choice i) intervention.  I’m v. that.  ii)  I. &amp; P. soln.  We must go on workg. thro’ Sec. Council.  Suggest resoln. there callg. them settle w’in 2 mos. but giving direct lead on points of disagreemt. betwn. I. &amp; P.  Eg.  a) nos. of troops on either side. b) Immedte. apptmt. pleb. administrator so it can go ahead w’out another pause after demilitn.

	Ask authy. to get agreemt. on this plan with U.S. and other Doms.



Sal.	No action = decision for India?  



I. 	Yes.  Must keep pressure on India.



A.E.	P. are getting v. impatient at delays.



I.	Indian elections won’t end until end/Jan.  P. willing to wait for Sec. Council until Feb.





		6.	High Commission Territories.



I.	Malan may ask for this immed. after his elections.

	Recommend we wait until he raises it.

	Don’t now suggest asking him to lay off.



A.E.	Wdn’t it be worth letting him know tht. we shall refuse if he asks.



I.	He is committed to raising it.  And there are things to discuss – eg. paras 8-10 of Annex.





		7.	Bamangwato Tribe.



P.M.	Tshekedi went v. well.



Sal.	Cdn’t we now say S. shall never return.

	Don’t believe it will prejudice Central Afr. Fedn.

	Wd. stop pressure eg. for depns from Tribe.



I.	Am preparing best case for justifying our line.



P.M.	Delay avoids major row in H/C. for 3-4 yrs.  A tough line now wd. provoke it – v. inconvenient debate.  In debate we shd. have to appear even tougher than we mean.



Sal.	Wd. help you to return stiff answer to Malan.

	Continual simmering there until it’s settled.



I.	Prefer to handle Parly. row on basis of W. Paper decision.



		8.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	First report.

	Decisions needed before Xmas.  Points involving legn.

	i) Purchase tax adjustment to encourage exports of textiles.

	ii) Civil expenditure.  Health Service cuts wd. involve legn.

	iii) Possibly small amendment of Education Act.



H.C.	Must leave any Bills introduced at same time as R.A.B.’s statement.



R.A.B.	General approach : keep Govt. expre. steady or slightly reduced, on Estimates.  Reserve big savings for Budget, when compensn. can be given by fiscal measures.



W.	Unpopular meantime.



Ch.	Won’t help b/payments position.  Hard to reconcile these cuts with Election pledges.  Wd. prefer to leave it all to Budget.



R.A.B.	But Estimates must go in in Jany.

	Ques is: do we put in Estimates reasonably pared.  Or do we seek to do somethg. dramatic?  I wd. put all these Educn. cuts in 1st category.  Health 1/= charge : but not Dental cut.

	All I want to do is present Estimates not larger than last year’s.



P.M.	Aim: cut deep when you cut at all.  Small no. of big economies via long list of small ones.  Eg. on Health, do only prescriptns.



R.A.B.	Contribns. only support £40. m. of the £400 m. total.
