C.C. 74(52).				29th July, 1952.



	1.	Iron &amp; Steel Bill.                        [Enter  Sw., 3 Service Ministers



Sal.	Hope R.A.B. will say the piece suggd by D.S.



R.A.B.	Indicated what he intended to say.



P.M.	Let Sal. see what is to be said &amp; give him a chance to suggest 

		small addn.





	2.	Parliamentary Delegation to Canada.



P.M.	Dislike 8 M.P.’s being risked in one plane.



Sal.	It is an offer of R.C.A.F. plane.  Awkward to decline.



Sw.	Can’t avoid their flying, together, in Canada.



A.E.	Sound Canadians about boat (C.P.R.) instead of ‘plane.



Sal.	Poss. alternative – return by sea.



P.M.	Give a hint to Canadians not to fly them (Tories) all in one batch.



P.M.	Put in a Peer vice M.P. with narrow majority.





	3.	Amnesty for Deserters.



P.M.	Want this.  But don’t press it as Coronation gesture.

	V. unhealthy to have these outlaws.

	After last war was lifted after 4 yrs.  Now, 7 yrs. have passed.

		Canada has done so &amp; Australia.  Comparison with war 

		criminals, to whom clemency has bn. shown.

	Don’t admit repercussion on N.S. men now serving.

	Are we to say they will never grant amnesty?



Sim.	Support strongly.



A.E.	Not in connn with Coronation.



P.M.	I agree:  do it quickly, if at all.



Al.	No need to extend to civil prisoners.  Men who have fought are in

		difft position.  I wd. like it, &amp; linked to Coronation.



A.H.	Problem not v. large.  Army deserters in U.K. – only 2.800.  Most are

		living with families, tho’ under assumed name.  Desertion in

		war more serious than in peace.  Strong reasons now for

		deserting fr. drafts procdg. overseas.



de L.	Support that.  Condoning desertion in war.  Those who successfully

		did it are now to be forgiven.  Unwise to do it, when we are

		in cold war.  “Hunted” etc., argument applies to those guilty

		of other crimes.



J.T.	I support this view, too.



J.S.	V. bad for discipline.  Army comrades hate deserters.



H.C.	I strongly agree with Services.



M-F.	So do I



			Resume discn – during recess.





	4.	Service Property in Bermuda.



J.T.	Here is our plan for Service agency.  Wd like to ask Bermuda to

		pay higher (Ty) figure.  If C.O. object, we want to sell 

		piece-meal with assistance of private agency.



O.L.	B. offer £650.000.  Vol. contn over 12 yrs. £480.000.  Agents

		fees £50.000.  M’tenance at £120.000 is v. low.  Risk tht. we

		shall get less than B. offer, and in addn look mean.



R.A.B.	Try for £1¼ m.  If they don’t accept, try to sell it piece-meal.



A.E.	May lose their £40.000 p.a.



Sw.	Appeal to them pays.  They are v. rich.  But don’t forfeit their

		good will.  Ldn. agents won’t be able to prevail v. passive

		resistce of Bermudans.



R.A.B.	They can well afford to pay more than £650.000.  They shd. be 

		pressed to give more.



O.L.	Stress risk of their cancelling vol. contribn.



Sw.	*  Settle a basic sum (£650.000) &amp; share any excess 50/50.*

			                     

			                   Agreed.





	5.	Territorial Waters.



A.E.	No F.O. interest save to reach agreemt.

	 4 mile limit:  we agreed it at Hague for Norway.  Iceland has now

		claimed it, &amp; we shall have diffy in resistg. it.  But all Dpts.

		agree we shd. preserve 3, as far as possible……….



J.T.	War interest of R.N.  Para. 4.



A.E.	Only applies to indented coast.

	Wd help us to secure other interests e.g. in Med.



L.	Extension wd. involve increased interference with our merchant ships.

	Why this hurry?  Intern. Law Commn are to study it.  Why not let 

		them do so first.  We must be v. careful about our interests.



L.P.	Qua inshore fishing T.D. wd. welcome.



J.S.	White fish Bd. has come down in favour of new system.

	No hurry.  Was an issue in my constituency in ’08.

	War – didn’t hamper Nelson or Vian.



P.M.	Agree.  War considns aren’t paramount because we shall over-ride if

		need be.



Ch.	Iron-ore traffic.



L.B.	Awkward if neutral establd large area, wh. we cdn’t inspect for mines.

	Aviation &amp; m/shipping wd. suffer fr. w’spread adoption of this

		scheme.



Al.	Need for careful thought.



L.	Wait for Commn.



A.E.	U.N. Commn:  won’t report until end/53.  Fear tht. m’while Denmark

		etc., will move in conformity with Hague decision.  Diff. for

		F.O. to influence others because we haven’t a clear view

		ourselves.



P.M.	Qua fishing, new method is to be preferred.

                   x|	But are there mil. arguments i) peace ii) pre-cautionary iii) war.

                     |	Let M/D. consider that with Serv. Ministers &amp; M/T. &amp; leathers

		&amp; M/St.



Sim.	No consultn with U.S. &amp; Comm.  All affected and L.O.’s.  Cd we

                    y|		not delay decision until their views have bn. ascertained.  New

                      |		legal theory of base line has prob. bn. establd.  All turns on 

		reasonable appln of it.



	Our fishing is subject to Conventions wh. wd. have to be denounced

		before base-line applied.



J.S.	I’ve bn. badgered for 28 yrs.  Hague decn means I shall be pressed.

			

			Agreed:    { Proceed at x/ (foreseeing current enemy)

			                 { Consider y/.





	6.	Persia.		[Enter  G.Ll.



A.E.	First rept. of suggn by M. tht. he mght. agree to arbitn not limited

		to compensn.  Offl. Cttee favoured sending symp. answer on that.

	But at next interview M. w’drew all that.  Must be nearly mad.

		All hopes have vanished.

	What to do now?  No good sending answer proposed.  Shd. appear to

		be running after him (1) Mght. however leak his 1st offer, &amp; our

		attitude to it.  Mght. damage M.  Amb. agrees.  Favour that.

	(2) M. will ask for relaxn of certain restns.  Ty. agree we can offer to

		consider that if we are makg. progress on oil.

	(3) Pol. sitn.  Tender now only alternative.  Asked U.S. wtr. we can’t

		find someone else to back e.g. mil. man, as in Egypt.  U.S.

		Amb. is not averse to that.



P.M.	Pretty stiff.



A.E.	Yes, but things are slipping twds Tudeh.



P.M.	Safe so long as U.S. keeps in step.  But a tricky business.



Sal.	See no other option.  Can’t sit &amp; watch situation deteriorate.



A.E.	U.S. will be v. nervous of Communist Persia.



P.M.	The man mght. be assured tht. if he were in control he wd. get

		renewal of U.S. help with arms &amp; grants and from us

		prs. some oil.  Dangerous to go further than that now.

	A.E. shd. continue to keep Cab. informed.

					[Exit  G.Ll.

					[Enter  D.S.

	7.	Defence Programme.



P.T.	R.A.B.’s speech contemplates tht. lead on metal-using indies will

		not increase:  no more.  Can’t do that, build houses and

		expand exports.  Hoped R.A.B. wd. say there wd. be some

		lightening of that load.  Thought P.M. was going to say more,

		acc. to what he read to Cab. last Thursday.



Al.	Put amendmt.



R.A.B.	Have recd welcome offer from Al. wh. I am going to pursue.

		Merits are O.K.  Matters less to P.T. what I say in speech

		save for impact on public.  Alex. formula for speech is an

		improvement.



A.H.	Care in statement re sales of equipmt.  Don’t give impn tht. it’s

		at expense of our Forces.  It is rather due to exceptl progress

		of production.

			

			After discn:  agreed tht. R.A.B. shd. use Alex. formula.

				[Exit  A.H., J.T., D.S.



	8.	Wages Policy.	don’t record this [sic]



W.M.	Must report on Thursd. ques. of reference back to W. Councils.

	   ..        ..      ..       ..      effect on engineering indies.



P.M.	No need for W.M. to spk. to-day.





	9.	Marshall Scholarships.



A.E.	All points were decided in consultn with Vice Chancellors, &amp; Rhodes

		Trust.  They will have to operate the scheme.



Ch.	At later ages you will get mainly Univ. Dons.



A.E.	Arguments in memo.



			              Discussion to be resumed.





	10.	Gatwick Airport.



R.A.B.	Agree:  inevitable.  Fit it into investment p’mme.



L.B.	Will be staggered over many years.  Will discuss with Ty.

			Agreed.		[Exit  L.B., de.L.





	11.	Overseas Information Services.



	1)	Accounting.     Agreed.



Sal.	2)	Enquiry.  Can you put this to ‘outside’ body, when it goes to

			defence &amp; f. policy.  Wd prefer Ministerial Cttee wh. wd. 

			hear evidence fr. outside.



A.E.	Diff. for Ministers to give time.

	Intended Cttee of 4 or 5 who knew this from inside in war.

	Must answer before recess.



Sal.	Parlt. will then want to see report.



P.M.	Prefer to keep it in Govt. hands.
